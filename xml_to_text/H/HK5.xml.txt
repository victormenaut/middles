The Parishes of Duxford, Ickleton and Hinxton in plurality
The Three Parish Churches are independent and share one incumbent.
They co-operate among themselves and with friends in the Ickleton Methodist Church and Duxford United Reformed Church.
Services take place on a regular basis in all three churches â€” the Book of Common Prayer, 1662 and the Alternative Service Book 1980, are used.
The service of Morning Worship is designed for all the family.
It lasts about 45 minutes, and is not usually Communion.
Further details of services, other events, and church officers may be found on the church notice boards and in the monthly "Church News Letter" available from the churches.
The clergy & staff are always willing to spend time with anyone living here; for this and Ministry and Holy Communion to the Sick & Housebound; Ministry to the bereaved, the dying and for funerals; for Confirmation, Baptism, and Weddings, please first contact your parish priest: Andrew Way.
