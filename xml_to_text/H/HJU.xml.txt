Dear Colleague, With the passage of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Bill in 1986, we may have thought that the animal rights movement would have become less militant and that scientific research would be subject to less disruption.
We can now see how far that view was optimistic.
It has become clear that the anti-vivisection movement is now far better organised and directed than in the past.
They have realised the effectiveness of the step-by-step approach, the moderate image and the long-term plan.
Separate animal rights organisations now work together in co-ordinated campaigns to persuade teenagers that animals should not be used in research.
Their campaigns such as "Health With Humanity" , "Violence-free Science" and "Living Without Cruelty" have been well designed and are being professionally marketed.
This persuasive approach, particularly aimed at the young, has been accompanied by selective targeting of individual researchers, who are the subject of demonstrations, press reports, telephone calls, and letters.
By attempting to discredit a few respected scientists in the eyes of the public they try to cast doubt upon the standing of the whole scientific community.
Since 1908, the Research Defence Society has been working to counteract the efforts of the anti-vivisection movement.
The RDS is fighting to resist the effect that these campaigns are having on public opinion.
If we do not support their efforts, animal-based research in this country will be slowly stifled.
You can help by joining the Research Defence Society and supporting our work to safeguard the future of biological and medical research.
Unless we work together to counter this threat, the contribution to knowledge, medicine and health that will come from research will be in jeopardy.
Yours sincerely, Lord Adrian President.
