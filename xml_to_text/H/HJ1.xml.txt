Local government is now of course a major provider of services to the citizen.
In line with the services provided by other governmental agencies much local government activity occurs through the medium of discretionary powers.
In consequence, it is clearly important that the average constituent/consumer has ample opportunity for expressing any dissatisfaction with decisions which have been taken in relation to them.
Traditionally, local councillors have filled this role and there is no doubt that they still remain a most vital source of redress for citizen complaints.
Nevertheless, increasing specialisation and complexity has meant that not all issues can be easily addressed by local councillors who are necessarily extraordinarily busy people by definition.
Since 1974 the ‘local ombudsman’ has been available to supplement the role of local councillors in dealing with complaints made by citizens in relation to local government services, while more recently certain statutory requirements have been emplaced to give other, slightly more formal, remedies.
Nevertheless there is no easily-discernible pattern for complaints redress in local government and the aim of this survey will be to investigate the various methods which are used in the resolution of complaints against local government service areas.
The views of councillors, officers, members of the public and the ombudsmen themselves will be sought and practices will be examined to see how far general principles emerge and how far recommendations for some improvement in the current situation might be possible.

Fraud is an area of crime of growing economic and social significance, but little is known about its victims.
The research involves mail questionnaires and interviews with a variety of individual and commercial fraud victims drawn from court, business and media sources, and examines the following questions: What is the impact of fraud upon victims, financially and emotionally?
By what process do recorded frauds come to be reported?
Why do fraud victims report or not report offences to the police (and what are their expectations from reporting)?
How satisfied are they with the various parts of the criminal justice process (policing, trial, and sentence) and why do they feel this way?
To what extent are fraud victims offered compensation (within or external to formal sentences)?
What impact has their victimisation experience had upon
(a)
their fraud prevention behaviour, and
(b)
the likelihood that should they (or people they know) become victims again, they would seek (or advise others to seek) the assistance of the police.
How does the sentencing of fraudsters relate to their social background and to the use of an organisation as a vehicle for fraud?
What is the nature of media coverage of fraud, and what are the principal problems of communicating frauds to the public?

It is well-known that the size if the inmate population of prisons and other custodial institutions varies enormously from one jurisdiction to another.
Even within one country the variations between states or provinces with fairly similar cultural and value systems are startling.
Fitzmaurice & Pease (1982) have also demonstrated that many of the most dramatic differences in the size of prison populations in European countries are caused by variations in sentence length rather than in the number of prison sentences.
Although these differences are now widely known, there is so far no satisfactory explanation nor do particular penal philosophies, or the adoption of deliberate policy choices in favour of a greater or lesser use of custody, necessarily seem to have expected or intended effect on one jurisdiction or explain why its of imprisonment differs from that of another jurisdiction.
This is not surprising because there is still comparatively little available evidence from which such explanations can be derived.
This study is designed to provide such evidence.
The project will obtain selected demographic information and comprehensive data on criminal justice and penal practices in different jurisdictions. it will thus show the ways in which the use of incarceration differs between them, test the validity of a number of ‘deterministic’ explanations of imprisonment rates and assesses the extent to which policy choices affect the use of incarceration.
The project is being coordinated by Dr Ken Pease (Department of Social Policy and Social Work, University of Manchester, England) and Dr Warren Young (Institute of Criminology, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand).
Collaborators in each of the selected jurisdictions will collect their own data and will be consulted about, and able to contribute towards the comparative analysis.

This project widens previous research in 1985–1988, supported by ESRC, into tax evasion and tax avoidance.
This work focussed on the ‘taxpayers side’ by studying the roles of individual professional advisors: accountants, solicitors, barristers and tax consultants.
This second phase moves up broader institutional levels, to examine the roles of City Institutions (such as merchant banks, insurance companies and pension funds) and State institutions (such as nationalised industries) in creating, marketing, operating and servicing tax avoidance devices or schemes.
It will also add the perspectives of the Inland Revenue and assess new policy developments aimed at control of evasion and regulation of avoidance.
The principal methods of investigation are the same in Phase 11 as they were in Phase 1: in-depth technical interviews with key professionals, participant observation at professional seminars, documentary and legal analysis and courtroom observation.
The theoretical interest of both phases 1 and 11 lies in four main socio-legal areas.
It offers a new perspective for regulation studies by examining the activities of those subject to the law as well as those of law making and enforcing bodies.
It contributes to theories of the role of the legal and other professions by clarifying what their services provide; their creative techniques for subversion as well as routine servicing for compliance with the law.
It highlights the problematic boundaries which define ‘white collar crime’.
Finally, the research provides an empirical critique of theories of law, state and class by showing the scope for ‘private law-making’ which may contradict public law, casting doubts over the ability of law to control economic elites.

Since the first British Crime Survey (BCS) was conducted in 1982 there have been several local surveys (among others Merseyside, Islington, Broadwater Farm and Hammersmith and Fulham) concerned with the incidence of crime, fear of crime, attitudes to the police and
punishment, and general matters concerning crime prevention and avoidance.
While there have been several academic studies using data from the 1982, and the subsequent 1984 BCS, there has been little or no independent research using the local data sets.
This research project will redress this lack.
By using the same statistical techniques on each data set within a consistent and coherent methodological framework it will add to the understanding of crime and its consequences.
In addition use will be made of the 1981 Census Small Area Statistics and data from the National On-Line Manpower Information System to construct neighbourhood demographic and socio-economic variables to enable a richer analysis of the national surveys to be undertaken.

This case study will investigate the differing views of non- school attendance held by non-attending pupils, teachers, education authorities, parents, social services, police and the courts.
The policy-related objectives will be two-fold: to assess the degree of congruity between the aims and methods of different agencies (EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, POLICE AND PROBATION) variously involved with delinquent or deviant school students aged 11-18; and to assess the extent to which different models of inter-agency co-operation and intervention have differential effects particularly in relation to 
(a)
returning school-age pupils to full-time or at least part-time education and
(b)
the entry of 11-18 year olds into the criminal justice or penal system.

One of the most significant recent developments in the criminal justice system in England and Wales has been the vast increase in the proportion of defendants legally advised and represented in the courts.
This increase is practically all accounted for through the provision of public funds, making legal aid the fastest growing social service in Britain.
Whilst practioners argue that still more monies need to be spent, government concern over demand-led expenditure has increased.
The debate raises fundamental questions for future arrangements: is more money needed to secure the protection of individuals, against possible miscarriage of justice?
Are current systems for delivering defence services the most appropriate for modern conditions?
Is current expenditure well spent and does it produce services of an appropriate quality?
Although these questions are of vital importance, little systematic information on these issues is available.
This three year research project seeks to remedy this shortcoming by examing what solicitors do, from the moment a defendant first seeks legal advice to the time of disposition.
It will focus on the day-to-day practices and working philosophies of solicitors, and examine their economic and organisational structures.
It is intended to provide a factual framework within which future debates can be conducted.

Britain's 56 area Probation Committees have a statutory responsibility for the efficient carrying out the work of the Probation Service, mainly through delegated management by the chief probation officer.
Their duties include the determination and monitoring of policy but there has not been research into this or any aspects of Probation Committees' work.
Following the serious disturbances in a number of Britain's cities during the summer of 1985, the Central Council of Probation Committees strongly recommended to its members that they develop policies to take account of the multiple social deprivations experienced by many probationers, particularly those living in urban areas.
This recommendation resonates ideas found in a number of contemporary reports and policy papers.
The research will document the manner in which Metropolitan Committees have organised their consideration of such ideas and how they have developed policy proposals.
Committee members, who are magistrates, judges, councillors and co-optees, will be interviewed about their work, as will their respective chief probation officer.
Data derived from the interviews will lead to analysis of the various perspectives about contemporary policy and its particular relevance to the work of the probation service, among committee members and chief probation officers.

There has been a steady increase in illegitimacy in the 1980s accompanied by a rise in unmarried parents' applications to court for maintenance, custody and access.
The research aims to monitor the law on illegitimacy in the light of the provisions which are to supercede it under the Family Law Reform Act 1987.
It will examine how the law operates in practice, its consequences and the potential outcome of the legislation contained in the new ACt.
It will consider how the law achieves its stated purpose of making financial provision for illegitimate children, and the issues raised by custody and access applications.
It will also investigate how unmarried parents are dealt with by the court system.
The research follows a feasibility study carried out in 1986 at Teesside Magistrates Court, supported by the Joseph Rowntree Trust.
The principal methods of investigation are court data collected from a sample of court records and observation of affiliation and guardianship of minors hearings.
The research will be carried out in the magistrates and county courts at Nottingham and Bristol.
It is hoped the research will provide a comparative basis to assess the effects of the legislation after it has been implemented.

The implementation of the European Community's 1992 programme depends very heavily on the enactment of new law, not just at Community level, but also — because most Community law does not work directly, but relies on national implementing measures — at national level.
Effective implementation of 1992 policies by all member Sates is of major importance, as differences in speed of implementation and seriousness of enforcement may just perpetuate the competitive distortions the programme was designed to eliminate.
This project aims to show how implementation actually occurs, by contemporaneous monitoring of all stages of the implementation process, from Community measure through to adjustment of business and other relevant behaviour.
A small number of measures have been selected for attention, applying in sectors with varied economic characteristics: air transport, and the foodstuffs industry.
The inquiries within this project are being conducted in parallel with similar monitoring efforts in all other Community countries, so that the results should show not only what legal difficulties exist in the way of fully effective enforcement in the Uk, but also how UK performance compares with that of other countries and which national legal systems within the Community are best able to ‘deliver’ effective implementation of 1992 policies.

The 1964 Police Act formally divided the responsibility for police policy-making between three bodies — the chief constable, the police authorities and the Home Secretary.
Since 1964, however, a number of changes, including the creation of new police liaison committees, the reorganisation of police authorities in the former Metropolitan Counties, and an enhanced role for the National Reporting Centre during the miners' strike, have transformed the context of decision-making about policing.
The study aims to describe and analyse how the various actors involved in police policy-making — the Home Office, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Home Secretary, the police authorities, pressure and community groups, political parties, the media, as well as the police themselves — interact to produce changes in the style, organisation or operation of policing on the ground.
The research seeks to assess how the present police policy-making process compares with the 1964 Act, and in particular, the extent of democratic involvement in that process.
The research design is a comparative one, involving the analysis of three or four policy initiatives in each of three or four police forces.
To provide the contextual background for the case studies, questionnaires will be mailed to all forces outside the case study areas, asking what action they have taken, if any, on the chose policy initiatives.

Prediction is an important part of making decisions.
Deciding whether to release a prisoner on parole, for example, needs a judgement about whether the prisoner is likely to commit another offence.
By examining data which give the criminal record and other characteristics for a sample of subjects it is possible to develop a statistical equation which can be used for making predictions.
A feature of statistical predictors is that their accuracy when applied to future subjects can be disappointing relative to the accuracy apparent from the cases on which the predictor was constructed.
This statistical phenomenon of ‘shrinkage’ can be quite marked.
A mathematical theory of statistical predictors and how to assess their accuracy has been developed by the principal investigator and others.
This new ESRC project will see how the theory can be applied to problems in criminology, and extended to cover special features of criminological data.
The aim is to develop new statistical methods which will predict the behaviour of future subjects as accurately as possible.
The results of the research will be tested out in a small number of case studies.

This study examines the role of police discretion in the handling of domestic violence assaults, particularly those between husband and wife or cohabitees.
The extent to which the nature of police action and police dispositions of domestic violence is influenced by policing priorities, organisation, training, understanding of civil and criminal law and private conceptions of what in this situation constitutes violence, are all features of central importance.
The study examines comparatively two boroughs, Hounslow and Islington, and shows the variations in:
(i)
reported domestic violence over a six month period
(ii)
methods of recording practice and criming
(iii)
referrals to civil agencies
(iv)
referrals to social service and other agencies.
The methodology involves extensive consultation of police records over a six month period together with indepth interviews with serving officers both men and women of varying experience throughout the police organisation from all ranks, from relief officers, CID to Inspectors of operations.

This research was stimulated by a recognition that we might have a rare opportunity, through being granted privileged access to assault victims in a busy hospital accident and emergency department, to study serious assaults which may or may not have been reported to the police and, therefore, the definition of which as crimes is still open to question.
Our focus will be upon key issues of criminal justice.
We shall be studying the relationship between
(a)
a certain type of behaviour, resulting in injury;
(b)
definition of that behaviour — first by victims, and secondly by police and courts; and
(c)
the response to that behaviour, either within the framework of criminal prosecution of independent of it.
Among the questions which we hope to answer are the following: 1.
Why are so many assaults requiring hospital treatment not reported to the police? 2.
How do assault victims consider the perpetrator should be dealt with?(what remedy do they consider appropriate, if any?) 3.
What are the circumstances of the assault (as perceived by the victim)?
For example, did the victim provoke the assailant?
Might the assailant be able to claim that he acted in self-defence? 4.
If there was an element of victim participation, to what extent, and in what ways, did it influence
(a)
the victim's definition of the assaulting behaviour;
(b)
the decision to report the matter to the police; and
(c)
the victims views concerning appropriate sentence? 5.
To what extent, and in what ways, does the existence of a prior relationship influence
(a)
victims' definition of the assaulting behaviour;
(b)
their inclination to report the matter to the police; and
(c)
their views concerning appropriate sentence? 6.
The thought that some serious assaults may not be defined (by the victim) as criminal also invites consideration of the possibility that even self-report studies may arrive at an under-representation of the true level of crime.
In other words, the proposed research should enable us to discover whether the dark figure of crime is even larger than self-report studies reveal it to be.

There has been growing concern about patients who are compulsorily detained in hospital as a result of being found unfit to plead or legally insane.
In all of these case an alleged offence ensures mandatory and indeterminate hospitalisation despite the fact that no trial has taken place in the former category while no conviction has been recorded in the latter.
At present around 177 such patients are detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 while approximately 74 patients are similarly detained under earlier analogous legislation.
This project will investigate all 74 cases together with a series of long term detention case under the 1964 Act.
At present little or nothing is known about these patients.
Accordingly, permission has been obtained from C3 Division of the Home Office to examine the files in each of these long term detention cases.
In addition permission has been granted to interview a sample of these patients together with their Responsible Medical Officers.
It is expected that the information gained from this research will be of interest to the Home Office, psychiatrists and lawyers as well as being of practical assistance to an overlooked section of detained patients.

The European programme for completing the Single European Market by the end of 1992 has raised a number of questions about the labour market.
These concern in particular the distribution of employment amongst members of the European Community and the quality of the jobs created.
The lowering of physical, technical and fiscal barriers may make it much more attractive for companies to take advantage of different labour market conditions in one country as compared with another.
Widely differing arguments have been advanced about how far individual member states and the Community should respond by introducing an element of social protection to this process of completing the Single European Market.
This project aims to investigate the evolution of rules at European and national level in selected areas of labour market regulation.
Particular attention will be paid to the interplay of arguments dealing with equity, economic efficiency and different legal systems.
A multi-disciplinary research approach will be adopted.
The research will involve analysis of legal documentation, synthesis of existing research and interviews with representatives of interest groups.
Comparative analysis with French and Spanish researchers is an integral part of the study.
This project forms part of a wider ESRC initiative on the Single European Market.

The purpose of the current study is to inform the Adoption Law Review and to contribute to the development of agency policy and practice.
It will also illuminate and extend our understanding of the ways in which the social institutions of law and welfare interact with the family.
It will complement a major study of adoption court records and practitioners' views of the adoption process which the research team has recently completed for the Department of Health.
Taking a contemporaneous approach, interviews will be conducted with a sample of birth parents, adoptive parents and, where possible, older adoptive children.
The aim of the study is to record, describe and analyse their perceptions and experience of the process of adoption thus providing an up-to-date picture of the consumer view.

During the years of South Africa's isolation from the world community and its suspension from the ILO, hybrid labour legislation was passed by the South African parliament which may or may not conform to the minimum standards for the protection of workers laid down in various ILO conventions.
The result has been to subject the legislative framework to piecemeal reforms leading in some instances, to incoherence within the present labour relations system.
There has been no comprehensive study made of legislation and practice in relation to ILO standards.
There is thus no authoritative work to which trades unions, employers, academics and legal practitioners can refer for reliable guidance in this area.
This lacuna has been made worse by the ILO's lack of jurisdiction to examine South African labour legislation since South Africa resigned from the Organisation in 1964.
The South African government has been under no obligation to submit reports to the ILO.
With South Africa's re-entry into the world community and the government's stated intention of rejoining the ILO the time is ripe for a comprehensive comparative study.
The aim of this project is therefore to undertake a comparison of South Africa's labour legislation with the ILO standards in order to ascertain the degree to which the former conform with the latter and provide a comprehensive historical resource base.

In recent years the rise in the crime rate has lead to increased concern on the part of both the police and the general public.
One of the major findings of criminology in the last decade has been the importance of repeat victimisation as a contributor to the overall crime rate.
This project will analyse multiple victimisation using statistical modelling techniques.
In particular it will investigate what individual and area characteristics give rise to a person having a high probability of being a victim of crime not just once, but repeatedly.
It is relevant that areas with the highest levels of crime are also areas in which repeat victimisation is also greatest.
The research will seek to clarify the influences that lead to this.
An understanding of the complex nature of repeat victimisation will have important policy implications.
In particular, providing the police force with risk tables would enable them to identify those first-time victims of crime most at risk of having the experience repeated.
It would thus provide crime prevention officers with a basis to put forward an effective crime prevention strategy to protect those most at risk.

A number of important issues have arisen in relation to privacy and data protection issues in the field of new telecommunications technology: in particular, the use of directory information by telecommunications operators, itemised billing, caller line identification and telemarketing.
The regulation of these issues has been the subject of activity by the European Community institutions and by the Council of Europe.
The European Commission has issued a draft Council directive, and negotiations are currently taking place to determine its final form: in general, it proceeds by taking the strictest protections from national law as the new European standard.
This project continues a first phase of research funded by the Office of the Data Protection Registrar, the Office of Telecommunications and the Department of Law in the University of Sheffield to investigate current law and practice in a number of European member states and in the United States with the aim of contributing to current policy debates and examining the handling of the issues of privacy and new technology by different legal and administrative cultures.

In a number of recent high profile miscarriages of criminal justice, one of the main issues has been the Appeal Court's use of new scientific (forensic) evidence and its re-assessment of scientific evidence used at trial.
Such exercises require the Court to reconstruct the issues contested at trial and, in so doing, to adapt the trial court rules of jurisdiction and evidence for the purposes of appeal.
This research will analyse this process of reconstruction and consider its implications for the continued use of scientific evidence within the criminal justice system.
The research will concentrate initially on the ‘Birmingham 6’ and ‘Maguire 7’cases on appeal.
Detailed case studies, which will involve reading original transcripts, will be followed up by interviews of forensic scientists.
The Court of Criminal Appeal's role and practices are currently under consideration by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.
It is probable that the Commission will suggest radical reform of the Court, or even its replacement.
This research will provide evidence on which such proposals could be based, by potentially highlighting the procedural and jurisdictional inadequacies of the present system.
The initial research is part of a broader investigation into issues that arise from the reception of new scientific evidence, at the appeal stage, into a variety of legal and quasi-legal fora.

Crime and criminal justice; Unemployment
The project is concerned with how unemployed offenders are dealt with by the courts and what problems are posed for courts and other agencies by having to deal with an increased number of unemployed people.
Previous research suggests that there are differences in the sentences received by employed and unemployed offenders, but there is little understanding of why this is, how important a person's employment situation is in the sentencing process and the dilemmas faced by sentencers and those who advise them.
The project will examine
(a)
the relationship between employment status and sentencing,
(b)
the perceptions of relevant parties concerning the sentencing of unemployed offenders,
(c)
problems arising with non-custodial and semi-custodial penalties, such as the fine; and
(d)
will put forward suggestions intended to improve policy and practice, where appropriate.
The project involves studying practice in three court areas with different levels of unemployment and, in each area, in courts with different sentencing patterns.
It draws on court, police and probation service records, interviews with court personnel and offenders and observation in the courts.
Various factors likely to influence sentencing are being taken into consideration, apart from a person's employment situation.

Law can prohibit or regulate activities: The citizen can obey or break the law.
Much criminological time has been devoted to explaining which route is taken and why.
What has failed to attract attention, however, is the fact that there is a third possible response — avoidance, using legal methods to get round the law.
Avoidance is a grey area at the boundaries of legality and illegality, and though it is an approach employed in many areas of law, it is nowhere more clearly institutionalised than in tax law.
This project examines the boundaries of legality and illegality in tax law and practice by exploring where the limits are defined between outright criminal evasion, legally unacceptable but non-criminal avoidance, and compliance.
It examines where the lines are drawn not just officially in statute, case law and revenue policy, but also in the professional practice of taxpayers' advisers.
The core of the research examines by way of in-depth interviews, the attitudes, roles, strategies and dilemmas of accountants, solicitors, barristers, tax consultants etc.
In particular the project focuses on recent anti-avoidance case law and statutory developments, and follows the professions' developing responses to them.
The project seeks to explain why grey areas can exist in law, to probe the balance of certainty and uncertainty in law, and to analyse the implications of this for the nature and effectiveness of law.
It explores the inter-relationships between official policy and professional practice and their adaptation to each other.
It aims to add to our understanding of the role of the legal and related professions in the making and application of law.
Finally it suggests an alternative approach to the standard studies of ‘white collar crime’ and the limits of legal regulation.

The term global commons refers to an assortment of geographical/physical entities such as the atmosphere, high seas and Antarctica, that are linked by their legal status of being outside national jurisdictions.
Over the years a number of international agreements have been drawn up for the management of various global commons.
Historically, resource allocation has been the prime objective (eg in relation to fisheries) and environmental protection has been no more than a secondary objective.
The elevation of environmental concerns in the social consciousness has raised the profile of environmental protection and has led to international agreements specifically concerned with the environment, such as the Montreal protocol on the ozone layer.
Taking the example of the atmosphere, the project aims to further our understanding of why international agreements for environmental protection are effective or ineffective.
This will be done by examining the social, political, legal and scientific factors that influence the conception and formulation of such agreements and by analysing their perceived effectiveness as revealed through their practical implementation, monitoring and verification procedures.
In the light of the results obtained it is intended to examine the relevance these agreements may have for agreements concerned with other aspects of global commons protection.

In constitutional theory, those who make the decisions of government are ultimately accountable to Parliament.
Private organisations, however, are not accountable to Parliament but, in the case of companies, to their owners and in the case of other corporate bodies, to their membership according to the rules of the organisation itself.
As the business of government has become more complex, cooperation and bargaining between government and private bodies has become frequent.
This has created problems of accountability.
On the one hand, public decisions may be delegated, in effect, to private bodies or be made through informal processes which exclude Parliament and the public generally.
On the other hand, the membership of corporate bodies may be excluded from knowledge of, or control over, the process of cooperation and bargaining.
The research examines the available literature on the processes of accountability which may exist within such arrangements.

The Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) 1991 was enacted as a result of major dissatisfaction with the way in which those found mentally unfit to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity were dealt with under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964.
Although the 1991 Act leaves the legal tests for both unfitness to plead and the defence of insanity intact, it nonetheless enacts procedural reforms of fundamental importance by in particular giving the courts wide powers of disposal.
The primary purpose of the proposed research will be to acquire detailed knowledge about how the new Act will operate.
This will be done with the full cooperation of C3 Division of the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Crown Prosecution Service all of whom have agreed to grant access to the relevant documentation in relation to cases during the first five years of the Act's operation.
Further, the cases in question will be compared with a wide sample of cases disposed of under the 1964 Act.
This research will enable all those professionally concerned with this important group of mentally abnormal offenders to consider what effect these reforms are having and whether changes in the policy or professional practice may be required as a result.

Although divorce is affecting an increasing number of people, little is known about the longer term social and economic effects of the financial arrangements made at the time of divorce.
The research aims to study those effects in two ways.
The first part of the study examines the impact of financial arrangements made at the time of the divorce on the people directly concerned for the three years following the divorce.
Detailed interviews are being conducted on a sample drawn from court records of divorced people representing men, women, pursuers, defenders, receivers and payers of maintenance.
The second part is a quantitative study which complements the first part.
It examines court divorce records and data on divorce already held by the Registrar General for Scotland.
This secondary analysis explores further the nature and level of financial awards on divorce made by the Court of Session of Scotland.

Phrases like ‘The child's best interests’, ‘the welfare of the child’ and ‘the child's needs’are used by legislators, judges, magistrates and social workers as ideals to be applied in decisions concerning children.
This is as true in Scotland and France as it is in England.
Yet, these three countries not only have different systems of legal decision making, with Children's Hearings in Scotland, children's judges in France and juvenile courts in England, but the philosophies and policies which lie behind these institutions and the nature of the decisions they arrive at are also very different.
What this research sets out to do is to examine, through the involvement of researchers and practitioners in all three countries, the reasons for these differences, whether they be historical, economic or ideological.
In particular, it analyses the way in which the phrases mentioned earlier are used by the professionals, legal and social workers involved in child care and juvenile justice to justify their intervention in the parent-child relationship and analyses their attempts to control children's behaviour.

The object of this study is to examine the extent to which those living in rural areas face particular problems of access in relation to legal advice and information of both general and specialist nature.
Do the inherent remoteness, lack of communications and generally weak social services in rural areas adversely affect the range and accessibility of legal services available?
The fieldwork for this study will be concentrated primarily in the counties of Devon and Cornwall and the first stage will be to plot the various points of contact between the providers of legal services and the populations they serve.
The second and most detailed stage will be a series of three interview surveys: of solicitors, to establish the amount and kinds of work they do; of general legal services, such as the Citizens' Advice Bureaux, to establish how far they complement or duplicate the service provided by solicitors; and of a sample of the population from selected parishes to find out the kinds of issues that have caused individuals to resort to legal advice.
In the final stage, a combination of geographical and legal techniques will be used to set the data collected from the surveys against idealised patterns of both provision and demand.
Having identified the gaps under the present system, it should be easier to formulate realistic policies for extending the provision of legal services throughout rural Britain.

Hazardous waste management is an increasing problem for industry, the public and the relevant authorities.
It is often transported for treatment and disposal across borders between countries and regions with different regulatory systems.
Efficient waste management requires that hazardous materials are defined and treated more carefully than the very large volumes of non-hazardous wastes.
Large and unnecessary extra costs are imposed if all waste is treated as hazardous; yet risks to the public result from allowing hazardous materials to be moved and disposed of cheaply as if it were ‘merely’ waste.
Regulation ought to involve precise definition and separation of wastes into hazardous and non-hazardous, or different levels of hazard.
This apparently clearcut technical job is in reality far more complicated because wastes vary so widely, may change their nature (and risks) during their existence, are handled by many different people and firms; and often ‘wastes’ contain valuable goods that may be recovered.
Different regulatory authorities deal with this problem in different ways, applying different kinds of technical regulation, at different points in the system of transport, treatment and disposal.
This project will find out how different local waste disposal authorities deal with this problem, especially how they apply national and EEC directives and regulations, and what effect regulation has on particular industries.
It will also try to understand how public reactions to hazardous waste regulation are affected by the kind of decision making used in regulation.

By autumn 1986 responsibility for criminal prosecutions will have been transferred from the police to a new Crown Prosecution Service staffed by lawyers under the control of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
However, the task of investigating crime, and the initial decision whether to proceed with a case, will remain with the police.
The aim of this research is to examine these early decisions by police and prosecutors both before and after the Crown Prosecution Service is introduced.
Particular consideration is given to:
(a)
the criteria adopted;
(b)
whether guidelines designed to control prosecution discretion are effective;
(c)
the level of consistency in decision making;
(d)
the way in which cases are prepared and presented to senior officers and to prosecutors, and the influence which this has on succeeding decisions.
The project has the co-operation of three English police forces.
Equal numbers of adult and juvenile non-motoring cases are being randomly selected from each force.
Each case is monitored as it progresses from arrest to final disposal.
The research will contribute to our understanding of the Criminal Justice System and the operation of discretion, and may assist in the formulation of policy.

There is widespread agreement on the need for prison reform but little consensus on the merits of various proposals for change.
Prison regimes are subject to pressures for change from many quarters and several aspects of prison practices are currently under review.
However, despite the importance of the issue, there has been little empirical research on the ways in which decisions are currently made by the prison authorities or the implications of these decisions for the prison service.
This project examines the process of decision-making in relation to categorisation, initial allocation to prison, recategorisation and movement between prisons, movement within the prison, access to employment and education, disciplinary procedures, recommendations for parole and for ‘training for freedom’.
In each case it attempts to explain what decisions are made, by whom, and how; why the system operates in the way it does; the problems that arise and the pressures for change; the obstacles which inhibit change; the effectiveness of different forms of accountability and the viability of alternatives to existing practices.
It involves all the long-stay prisons in Scotland.
A combination of observation, documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with prison staff, civil servants and various interest groups is being used.

The central aim of the study was to explore the nature of the overall service provided by the police to the public: ‘policing on the ground’, focussing on everyday policing, and to describe the priorities currently being given by the police to the various parts of their workload in response to demand from the public.
The study was carried out in three subdivisions of different police forces.
The first task was to measure the demand from the public.
Periods of observation were spent in the control room, at the front desk and out on patrol with officers in each subdivision, and police records of messages received analysed.
The second task was to follow through the police response to this demand, noting what was committed to paper, which officers dealt with incidents, the goals they were seeking to achieve, and what actually happened.
A sample of ten different kinds of incident, ranging over the whole spectrum of demand (burglary of a dwelling, theft from motor vehicles, shoplifting, disturbances, disturbed people, injury, traffic accidents, found property, civil emergencies, shotgun licensing and domestic disputes) was followed through its police life, by analysing all police records, by observation of officers dealing with these incidents, and by both formal and informal interviews with officers of all ranks dealing with such incidents.
Thirdly officers of different ranks and specialisms were interviewed, to investigate their perceptions of the constraints on their work and their priorities.
Findings from the three forces were compared to discover differences in demand input and in priorities.

The available published statistics on the race of people involved in the criminal justice system indicate a degree of black over-representation.
However, the statistical picture remains somewhat unclear for two main reasons: the data have not always been analysed with sufficient attention to all the possible factors implicated in such over-representation; there are insufficient provincial data to show how general are the London results.
The research has three main aspects.
First it is intended to examine the statistics of how young people from different ethnic groups are dealt with by the police and the courts in a city outside London.
Secondly, a survey will be conducted to compare the experiences of, and attitudes to, the police and other criminal justice personnel of young black and white males living in a selected provincial city.
Finally, it is intended to carry out some observational work at a selected site in the system, possibly courts, and interview key participants.

The Centre was originally established in 1972 as an SSRC research unit and became a DRC in 1985.
Its research programme comprises a range of projects which focus on the role and function of law in society.
A distinctive characteristic of the Centre's research is its multidisciplinarity (with members of staff from law, sociology, psychology, social policy, history, economics and philosophy).
The Centre is also engaged in research training (supervising graduate research and providing some undergraduate teaching), in organising conferences and seminars; in publishing both substantial pieces of original research on socio-legal topics and other socio-legal materials, such as bibliographies); in providing an institutional locus for visiting scholars from elsewhere in Britain and from overseas, and in responding to a growing demand for advice and information about socio-legal studies in a variety of ways.
Regulation Investigators: Dr G R Baldwin, Dr P W J Bartrip, P Fenn, Dr K O Hawkins, H Genn, Dr B M Hutter, Dr S M A Lloyd-Bostock, Dr P K Manning, Dr C G Veljanovski Research into regulation is a major concern of staff at the Centre and is now the largest grouping of projects.
The principal focus of this research is the major regulatory arena of occupational health and safety.
The overall programme, which is described in detail in An Agenda for Socio-Legal Research into the Regulation of Health and Safety at Work (available from the Centre), is a multi-disciplinary collaborative exercise.
The various component projects have been designed with a view to producing a coherent perspective on the evolution of regulations, policy-making and implementation in regulatory agencies, and the impact of regulatory controls in the broad field of safety and health at work.
Procedures for adjudication and dispute settlement Investigators: Dr J M Atkinson, Dr C J Whelan This programme of research is concerned with developing and applying a range of social scientific approaches to the study of legal procedures for adjudication and dispute settlement.
One of its central aims is to develop an empirically grounded understanding of the structure, form and operation of different rules of evidence and procedure, and to explore the relevance of such research for current policy debates about the relative merits of alternative methods of dispute settlement — particularly where these involve innovations aimed at making courts more ‘informal’ or accessible.
Families and the law Investigators: Dr R W Dingwall, J M Eekelaar, M Maclean The Centre's work in the field of family law has developed through a series of related projects clustered around a clearly focused concern with the interests of children as members of families and as individuals and with the economic and other consequences of marriage breakdown.
This approach is based on follow-up work to a project on protection of children thought to have been abused or neglected and on empirical studies of the effects of divorce on family income, published 1986 by OUP under the title of ‘Maintenance after Divorce’ and para-legal decision-making on divorce.
The basic concern forms the theoretical foundation for current work on the long term consequences of divorce for children, the role of conciliation when marriage ends, and the relationship between family and work responsibilities.
Compensation for illness and injury (follow-up studies) Investigators: Dr P W J Bartrip, P Fenn, H Genn Two follow-up studies have been completed: the social history of the workmen's compensation system 1897-1948; and the study of out-of-court settlements in personal injury claims, which is based on interviews with lawyers and insurance officers.
Contract and business law Investigators: D R Harris, Dr C G Veljanovski Considerable work has been undertaken focusing on a range of issues arising in contract law (including involvement in an Anglo-French project), and an empirical study of the contractual relationship between car manufacturers and dealers.
Tax evasion and avoidance Investigator: Dr D J McBarnet, Dr G Mansfield This is an empirical study of the theme of legal avoidance developed theoretically by Dr McBarnet in relation to insolvency and business law.
It draws on interviews with accountants, lawyers, the Inland Revenue et al, in the wake of major new developments in the law related to tax planning.
Law and psychology Investigator: Dr S M A Lloyd-Bostock The ESRC Law and Psychology conference series, run under the auspices of the Centre, continues this year with a major conference on Criminal Sentencing.

This three year programme of research examines the present and future effects of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) and the Prosecution of Offences Act.
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides the police with many new general powers, replacing earlier piecemeal statutory powers and an incomplete patchwork of common law powers.
The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, which establishes a new system for the public prosecution of crime in England and Wales, also affects police powers and accountability.
The research programme addresses the following areas: police ability to exercise improved internal management controls; the relationship of the police and the public; the ability of the police to prevent and detect crime and the strategies they adopt; and the relationship between an independent prosecution service and police powers and practices.

The aim of this research programme is to undertake an examination of the development and operation of important aspects of the criminal justice system in contemporary Britain with the aim of identifying ‘best practice’ methods of dealing with crime and rehabilitating the criminal.
It is intended that the results of the programme will inform the public about policy options.
The main themes being covered by the individual projects are: the nature of the criminal justice system; police accountability; the role of the media in shaping public attitudes towards crime and the criminal; and studies of crime and the criminal.
The research programme, for which 730,000 has been allocated, is being funded largely by the ESRC, with contributions from both the Home Office and DHSS.

Someone who wishes to challenge a governmental decision, be it a decision of a central government department, local authority or other public body, may proceed in a number of ways.
He may raise the matter directly himself with the authority concerned.
He may ask his Member of Parliament to take up his case.
(In cases involving central government his MP can ask the Ombudsman to conduct an investigation.)
He may exercise a right of appeal if one is provided by the legislation under which the decision complained of was taken.
And he may invite the court to review the legality of what has been done.
This last process is known as the judicial review.
Surprisingly, in view of the importance attached to judicial review, we have no knowledge of the frequency with which it is resorted to in Scotland, the matters in respect of which review is sought, or the results of applications.
The introduction of a new procedure for judicial review in the Court of Session in 1985 provides a unique opportunity to answer these questions and this will be one of the aims of the research.
The new procedure also raises more difficult questions of the balance to be struck between the interest of those challenging the legality of governmental decisions and the interests of government itself.
The research will therefore also be concerned to establish, through monitoring the progress of applications, attendance at court hearings and interviews, whether the new procedure does indeed provide, as was intended, a faster and more flexible method of challenging the legality of governmental decisions.

The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate juvenile court hearings of applications for access by parents, guardians and custodians to certain categories of children in local authority care, following the receipt of termination notices from Social Service Departments.
Until the changes introduced by the Health and Social Services and Social Security Act (HASSASSA) 1983 were implemented in January 1984, access arrangements to many children in care were at the discretion of the local authority, and not the subject of court scrutiny.
However, access arrangements for certain categories of children in care were already under the control of the court, such as those in care under a High Court order, or a County Court order under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
Objectives The objectives of the proposed study are as follows: 1.
to explore how courts apply the duty imposed by the Child Care Act 1980 to give the child's welfare first and paramount consideration; 2. to examine the practices in use for providing magistrates with impartial information; 3. to discover whether parents' solicitors experience difficulties in getting background history of cases from Social Services Departments; 4. to judge whether parents at are a disadvantage in court; 5. to monitor how solicitors conduct their cases, and how they emply the various possible lines of argument of the Code of Practice on Access; 6. to discuss the underlying attitudes of the magistrates and social workers towards access to children in care, the reasons for their viewpoints and whether the publication of the Code caused them to change any of their positions.
The Association of Directors of Social Services has given its approval for this research proposal.
Background Adoption has become a popular solution to the longterm needs of certain children in care, including older children, and Social Services Departments have become more inclined to intervene and terminate access to birth parents.
Parents and pressure groups representing parents, were concerned that Social Services Departments were to ready to end parental contact with children in care, and thus pave the way for adoption.
However, it is necessary to see the problem, not in terms of a battle between parents and Social Services Departments, but in terms of the welfare of the child, and therefore it is important to assess the new legislation as a means of safeguarding parental contact which is beneficial to the child.
The Need for Research The new legislation requires to be monitored in a variety of ways: 1.
Impartial Guidance: Magistrates are expected to decide whether to grant access to parents, guardians or custodians, and, if they do so, to determine the conditions of access.
Unless a Guardian ad Litem(GAL) is appointed, they may have to do so without the assistance of a welfare report.
This research project would discover whether practices have been developed in courts for providing magistrates with impartial guidance, and how frequently GAL's are appointed.
2.
Access to Relevant Material by the Parents' Solicitors: Solicitors representing parents may experience difficulties in getting background history of the child in care when preparing their cases, whereas solicitors representing Social Services Departments are likely to be drawn from the local authority Legal Departments, and to be fully informed.
Difficulties of parents' solicitors would be recorded.
3.
The Balance of Power in the Court: Parents may be at a disadvantage in court because of their lack of familiarity with court proceedings, and their past experiences in court may prove inhibiting.
Magistrates may have some difficulty in putting on an equal footing Social Services Departments, and the parents of children in care.
The courts may be impressed by the expertise of the social workers; alternatively, they may tend to side with parents faced with the power of the Social Services Departments.
The balance of the power of the court would be investigated.

The principal aim of this study will be to assess the extent to which police conduct and decision making in a number of areas appear to have been influenced by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (1984).
The Act and its associated Codes of Practice incorporates, amongst its many provisions, different methods of structuring police discretion including the requirement for the police to keep detailed records of the exercise of certain powers.
The focus will be on the early stages of the police investigation of offences, and is likely to include the exercise of powers to stop and search suspected persons, the search of premises and seizure of property, and the detention of suspects in police custody.
The findings are expected to make a contribution to the practical evaluation of the Act, and to wider debates concerning the relationship between law, discretion and working practices in the criminal justice process.
The research will involve the study of official records kept of the exercise of powers, observation of the handling of cases by the police, and interviews with police officers of all ranks; it will be conducted in three separate subdivisions presenting different kinds of policing problems.

One of the aims of the newly introduced Crown Prosecution Service is to increase consistency in prosecutors' policy across the country and thereby ensure a more consistent standard of justice.
Police Force decisions to caution or prosecute juvenile offenders, however, show a wide variation with some areas cautioning twice the proportion of juveniles as others.
The research examines how the newly introduced service sets about its job and how effective it is in reducing variations.
To do this, two police force areas with differing practices have been approached to take part in the research and the impact of the introduction of the Crown Prosecutor recorded.
A sample of all juvenile cases referred for criminal behaviour in one calendar month in two police force areas collected and followed up to examine the decisions taken about them.
In addition a number of smaller samples is examined in detail since they are expected to show up any differences in perspective as between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.
The samples are those juveniles under the age of fourteen years, those charged with burglary and those where the decision of the police to prosecute is overturned by the Crown Prosecutor as not requiring prosecution.
The differences between the police and prosecutors are explored by interviews with senior officers of both services.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and its Codes of Practice affect many aspects of police practice and procedure.
One of the most significant areas covered by the Act is the conduct of interrogations by the police.
The legislation has been designed in part on the basis of research on custodial interrogation carried out for the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure.
This project is repeating one of these studies to assess the effects of the Act and Codes on custodial interrogation by the police.
The research, involving observation of a sample of cases being investigated by Brighton CID, will replicate in every detail what was done in 1979.
Interviews in progress will be watched and all details of the cases recorded.
The procedures on the cell block will also be observed to see how the Act has been implemented.
In case police behaviour changes as new procedures and rules become familiar, then whole research exercise will be repeated again after the Act has been operational for eighteen months (summer 1987).
Initial results from the first phase of the research (summer 1986) show that the police are sticking very closely to the new rules and that this has had a major impact in the way CID officers conduct investigations.
Most significantly, the persuasive interview techniques which used to be a feature of most interrogations have been abandoned partly because of the new requirement that there should be a verbatim contemporaneous record of every interview.
Surprisingly this has not directly affected the rate at which interrogation produces admissions.

The old adage ‘an Englishman's home is his castle’ emphasises the importance which past and present citizens attach to their right of privacy, in particular the right to peacefully enjoy their property and the privacy of their papers.
However, the right has never been absolute.
It was recognised in the fifteenth century that the right had to give way to the public interest in the administration ofjustice.
The gradual encroachment of the state in the succeeding centuries took on the dimensions of a tidal wave in the twentieth century.
Part II of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which consolidated existing powers of search and seizure and created some new powers, is to some the final demolition of the ‘Englishman's castle’, whilst to others it represents a balance between the individual's right to privacy and the public interest in the administration of justice in an age of rampant crime.
What is the reality?
The research will seek the answer to that question by a detailed study of the exercise of the various police powers of search and seizure contained in the 1984 Act.
The main objectives of the research are:
(i)
to examine the use made of the new powers;
(ii)
to assess the effectiveness of these new powers in enabling the police to detect and prosecute offenders;
(iii)
to assess the effectiveness of the safeguards against abuse of these powers which the Act provides; and
(iv)
to assess the impact of these new powers on the citizens who are the object their exercise.

An investigative public inquiry was convened by the Secretary of State for Energy into the economic, safety, waste management and local planning aspects of a pressurised water reactor proposed by the Central Electricity Generating Station at its Sizewell B site at Sizewell in Suffolk.
This research proposal is designed to look at how this Inquiry fits into an evolutionary model of the development of the public inquiry as a democratic and political device for analysing information and ensuring that legal interests are safeguarded, what views the various participants have of the Inquiry before, during and after it occurs, and how the Inquiry as a process handles the arguments raised by its terms of reference, from the viewpoints of fairness, fullness, thoroughness and public legitimacy.

Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1981 gives parents a right to select the school they wish their children to attend and imposes a duty on education authorities to comply with parental choice, unless one of a limited number of circumstances applies.
Education authorities are required to produce guidelines which describe how children are to be allocated to schools and which outline procedures for deciding between competing claims when the number of requests for a particular school exceeds the number of places available, and to publish information about particular schools.
Dissatisfied parents are given a right of appeal to a specially constituted appeal committee and from there to the sheriff.
The research consists of five inter-related projects.
Project 1 explores the origins and emergence of the legislation; Project 2 examines the implementation of the legislation by three education authorities, focusing on the formulation of guidelines, the establishment of appeal committees and the provision of information about schools; Project 3 comprises a survey of parents designed to elicit why some parents choose particular schools for their children and others not; Project 4 is a study of appeals which seeks to explain why some disappointed parents use the appeal procedures and others do not and how decisions are made by the appeal committees; while Project 5 attempts to identify the characteristics of ‘popular’ and ‘unpopular’schools.

Perhaps the most prevalent belief about crime is that it will ‘explode’ if penalties are relaxed, and can be contained only if they are stiffened.
A related belief is that reducing the prison population at a time of rising crime is not possible, not least because ‘public opinion’ would not countenance it.
In the Netherlands, however, it appears that for much of the past 30 years, a substantial reduction in levels of imprisonment occurred with no greater rise in crime than occurred in Britain; and that reduction occurred at a time of rising crime in Holland.
This project, which is a continuation in some respects of work conducted in 1981-2, seeks to evaluate how this change in policy originated, how it has affected crime rates and penal policy in other respects, to what extent the policy is now being modified, and the implications for sentencing and imprisonment in Britain.

The research is concerned with the speech of those who become deaf after acquiring language — the postlingual deaf.
Pilot work has shown that speech degeneration often occurs, leading to communication problems in the form of impaired intelligibility and adverse reactions from listeners.
These effects are mild for some sufferers, severe for others with comparable hearing losses.
This project aims primarily to extend knowledge on the incidence, degree and nature of speech degeneration and its implications for communication.
Three main developments are
(i)
the collection of a larger body of material;
(ii)
the extension of computer-based techniques to reveal the acoustic abnormalities of postlingual deaf speech;
(iii)
the use of more sophisticated techniques to assess what listeners make of the speech.
Attention will be paid to studying communication problems in situations which are as natural as possible.
Secondary aims are to study what the postlingual deaf feel about their state and others' attitudes to it, and their lipreading skills.
The research will not in itself provide practical solutions to the problems created by postlingual deaf speech.
It will rather, seek to provide a cogent and detailed description of the situation as a base on which practical solutions may be built.

The need, by speech therapists, psychologists and researchers, for an empirically based scale of language development was met by the production by D J Satterly of the pilot version of the Bristol Scale of Language Development (BLADES) based on Dr Gordon Wells' Bristol Language Project.
The scale was obtained from the longitudinal records of naturalistic speech of 128 normal children between 15 months and 5 years.
It gives the sequential development of 111 items, selected from the pragmatic, semantic and syntactic systems, grouped into ten major levels.
The present research aims to:—
(1)
provide supplements to BLADES giving the sequence within sub-systems eg for pronouns, sentence meaning relations, time, modality, conjunctions and syntax.
(2)
report on the reliability and validity of the scale for samples of speech collected both naturalistically, as in the original project and in a variety of more structured situations.
(3)
prepare a revised version of the manual which will have sections on collecting and transcribing samples, instructions for coding the samples for BLADES and for the supplements, and the results of the reliability and validity studies.

The project investigates strategies which contribute to effective listening.
The project examines the behaviour of speakers and listeners engaged in the task of exchanging information.
The information will range from ‘easy’ content, for example, simple instructions, to ‘difficult’content; for example , the justification of a complex course of action.
The study observes how listeners cope with messages which they find difficult to understand and the ways in which both participants in the conversation ‘repair’ and improve the exchange of information.
Whereas most research on listening uses academically successful individuals as subjects (typically undergraduates), the project studies the behaviour of 14-16 year olds in secondary schools, being particularly concerned with differences in strategies, or use of strategies, between those who are judged within the school system to be academically successful and those who are judged to be unsuccessful.
The research is being conducted within the theoretical context of ‘discourse models’— the mental representations which a listener constructs on the basis of what he knows about the world in general, what the speaker is actually saying and what he thinks the speaker is intending to say.
It involves detailed description of what is actually said and done by the participants.

All languages make systematic use of voice pitch to convey meaning, but they do so in different ways for different purposes, the main categories of pitch use being ‘tone’ and ‘intonation’.
Though not all languages have tone, intonation is a universal linguistic phenomenon, and in languages which have both, they interact with one another in various ways.
All languages also have some kind of rhythmical or accentual structure, and again intonation interacts with this structure in different ways in different cases.
This project aims to investigate the intonation structures of a variety of languages of different types, particularly with regard to these interactions with tonal and accentual features.
Although intonation has been extensively studied in the last few decades, detailed descriptions of all but a handful of well-known languages are few, and the wide variety of theoretical assumptions which underlie them makes comparison difficult.
The project therefore attempts to devise a more general descriptive framework for the intonation of the languages investigated and to establish a general theory of intonation structure which takes account of the different role of intonation in languages of different types.

The aim of this project is to answer some specific questions about how language, logic and memory interact in the interpretation of utterances.
First, how is successful communication possible despite the fact that many utterances produced are incomplete, elliptical or linguistically ill-formed?
Second, why are the meanings of words often felt to change from context to context, and how is successful communication possible if such instability exists?
Third, how can a speaker or writer successfully communicate certain opinions and attitudes without explicitly putting them into words?
Outline answers to these questions have already been suggested; the aim of the project is to develop them in detail.
The results should be of interest to linguists, philosophers and cognitive psychologists.
The difficulties of experimentation in this area are well known.
The aim is to provide a general framework in which existing experimental results can be interpreted and new experiments formulated, but which will also explain the wealth of informal, intuitive observations that any reader or conversational participant can provide.

R/000/23/1142 The primary aim of this project (which we call Project SUSANNE —‘surface and underlying structural analyses of naturalistic English’) was to create a sizeable machine-readable sample of written English annotated with the fullest possible grammatical information and selected semantic information, in order to provide language researchers with a source of information (including statistical information) about patterns of usage in authentic English.
A secondary aim which came to the fore as the project developed was to define the categories of the annotation scheme sufficiently rigorously that they can be applied in a predictable fashion to other language samples — that is, the SUSANNE annotation scheme is intended to offer a ‘Linnaean Taxonomy for the English Language’.
The strategy adopted was to begin with the best analysed corpus available when we started work (Alvar Ellegard's 128,000 word analysed subset of the Brown Corpus of American English), convert it into a format that could be used in practice, and improve and extend it in various ways.

How word meanings combine is a key question when attempting to account for the way discourse is understood.
Assuming that the meaning of a word is the concept it expresses, this question concerns the way that lexical concepts combine.
The research addresses two general observations with respect to such combinations.
The first is that the meaning of a word is not fixed like a dictionary definition, but rather it varies according to the words with which it enters into combination: consider the different meanings of ‘white’ in the expressions ‘white wine’and ‘white coffee’.
The second concerns the role of syntactic dependency in determining the meaning of a combination.
For example, the adjective ‘stone’ modifies the noun ‘bridge’in the expression ‘stone bridge’, and this denotes a subordinate type of noun class.
But adjectival modification of a noun does not always result in sub-classification (cf ‘stone lion’).
That is, the meaning of the combination is also influenced by an interaction between the meanings of its constituents.

Psychologists and cognitive scientists show a continued interest in the way in which people come to understand what they are reading.
For the computational linguist, such studies are important in shaping how artificial (computer) understanding might develop.
The detailed exploration of how the brain can support something as complex as discourse understanding is arguably one of the most interesting scientific questions of today.
The work to be undertaken is an integration of existing literature, and the development of explanations of how people understand what they read.
Particular attention will be paid to the applicability of the newly-emerging connectionist models to comprehension, especially to modelling patterns of inference made during understanding.
In contrast to conventional computational methods, connectionist systems use many relatively simple units, richly connected to each other, in order to carry out computations.
Such architectures allow for a range of subtle interactions between units, while supporting essentially parallel computation.
The attraction of connectionism for the present problem is that understanding is based upon continuously checking what is read against background knowledge, using a large number of constraints to guide the process.
This requires both parallel processing and a system of constraint satisfaction, and connectionism offers a way of implementing such a system.
The outcome of the research should be a more refined version of discourse comprehension and an evaluation of connectionist models as implementations.

How the mind works is a question we are at last beginning to be able to answer.
Encouragingly different theories are converging.
There is the hypothesis that all information used by the brain is processed in an inner ‘language of thought’, with complex ‘input systems’ which get information from the various incoming data, visual, aural.
etc., into representations in this inner language: the human language capacity is itself as complex input system, a grammar being a system for ‘understanding’ given language signals in terms of this inner language (FODOR 1983).
There is the hypothesis that these input systems do not themselves fully specify the information we derive from them, that there is subconscious guesswork involved in acts of seeing, hearing and language processing: the mind is constrained to operate on a least effort principle, imposing the first interpretation it can, commensurate with providing adequate information (SPERBER and WILSON 1986).
These very general claims about the mind lead to a new account of language.
R000231220 will argue the case for this new theory of grammar using ordinary language data, specifying the form a grammar must take as an input system.
Its novelty lies in being the first formal account of language ability that is part of an overall theory of cognition.
For the first time ever, we can see how the process of understanding language fits into the general picture we have about mental processes.

In this project we propose to develop a computer model to explore the semantics and pragmatics of modal and hypothetical questions and answers.
The model is in several stages.
A knowledge base represents information available to a variety of individuals involved in the construction of a building: this domain provides an opportunity for reasoning about various kinds of modality — possibility, necessity, temporal, causal etc.
Information in the knowledge base will be expressed in a version of ‘property theory’.
An ‘ordinary language’ question addressed to this knowledge base (for example, Can the plasterer start on Friday?) is analyzed into a semantic representation.
This is passed on to a set of inference rules cast in an appropriate non-monotonic logic which operate over the knowledge base to determine an appropriately helpful answer.
Finally, the answer is passed to a sentence generator which will reply in ‘ordinary language’(Perhaps, Yes, if the electrician has finished by then).

Caribbean Creoles were created some three hundred years ago.
Their vocabularies derive from colonial languages, but their grammars do not, or only superficially.
The Creoles have recently been shown to be tonal, to express grammatical relations and even vocabulary differences (though rarely) through relative pitch differences on individual syllables.
Since the fifties, a Caribbean, largely Jamaican, community has sprung up in Britain.
Second and third generations continue to use Black English, and a proportion actually use a Jamaican-derived Creole, alongside their local/standard English.
The object of this research is to begin analysis of the tonal system of British Jamaican Creole as spoken by British born people aged 16-19 years and living in Dudley, West Midlands.
Speech data came from a previous ESRC funded project (Language use in British Black Community).
Work is continuing but research already shows that subjunctive, imperative and indicative moods of the verb are marked by tone, as are preverbal particles marking tense and other semantics.
In noun phrases, genitive constructions — the man (‘s) dog — are tonally differentiated from compounds — the man-dog.
Tone greatly aids the researchers' understanding of Creole grammar, which appears less simple than was thought.

Over the past decade, work on formal theories of meaning for natural languages has developed very swiftly.
Now several alternative notations are available, and no attempt to evaluate all of them has yet been made.
This project seeks to provide such an evaluation, assessing each of the major formalisms against two data problem-areas:
(i)
the problem of predicting the varying interpretations of sentences containing more than one quantified expression from the linear sequence of the sentence-string (called ‘scope ambiguities’),
(ii)
the problem of predicting the varying interpretations of sentences involving generalisations about a class of entities (called ‘generics’).
In addition, the project also makes use of the evidence of ESRC project HR 6802 ‘Problems of Ambiguity’.
In each case the point of departure is a surface-syntax input.
The aim of the project is to provide evidence for selecting one form of semantic description as the explanatory basis for the semantic component of a grammar within general linguistic theory.

Gender is probably the most puzzling and least well understood of the grammatical categories.
It is surprising that languages should group nouns into masculines and feminines, for example, and should categorise inanimate objects in this way.
Artificial languages, such as those devised for computers, have no such category.
Being peculiar to natural language, gender is of particular interest.
Furthermore, it is tremendously varied in the languages of the world.
Four main areas are being studied:
(1)
how does a speaker of French, Russian or Swahili know the gender of a given noun?
(2)
how is it that in languages such as Polish a noun's gender appears to change according to whether the noun is singular or plural?
(3)
why do some nouns show different genders depending on the construction of the rest of the sentence?
(4)
how do languages resolve gender conflicts (when another word has to show agreement with two or more nouns of different gender)?
This approach will be typological, that is to say, a wide range of languages will be investigated in order to identify the different types of gender system.
The most immediate practical benefits are likely to be in foreign language teaching, where clear statements of the rules of gender would be of great value.
In the longer term, all contributions to our understanding of human language (in particular, how it differs from artificial languages) are important for developments in numerous areas, ranging from speech therapy to natural language processing.

British Sign Language (BSL) is the language of over 30,000 members of the British deaf Community.
A language with its own grammar and vocabulary, it has existed alongside English for at least 350 years, and is the fourth most widely used indigenous language in Britain.
In 1981, the first ever national television series presented in BSL began.
Since that first series, major changes have occurred in the language.
For BSL, a language with no written form, national television offered the first context for standardisation of a language of low status, reputed to vary widely in different regions of the country.
The changes in the languages as seen on television reflect its higher status and the loss of regional dialects.
The study will describe these changes through computer-based linguistic analysis of BBC archive tapes, interviews with signers who have appeared on the programme, and interviews with programme viewers.
The findings will be of relevance to those concerned with language use amongst other minority linguistic groups in britain, and those providing training courses in BSL and communications with the deaf.

Does using the pupil's mother tongue in teaching a second language help or hinder their progress?
If so, in what ways?
The study addresses such questions in primary school settings.
It will examine any differences in children's writing arising from their being taught writing through either themedium of their home language, or the language they are learnng.
Since we cannot simply assume that the results from one bilingual setting must apply to all others too, we shall study two widely differing groups of bilingual children in the UK.
Welsh-English bilinguals in Gwynedd and Punjabi bilinguals in Lancashire.
In North-Wales, the status of Welsh is now well established, while such is not the case with Punjabi in Lancashire.
Attitudes as well as writing skills will be compared in the two groups at the beginning and end of a 12 week experimental teaching period.
Their writing will be analysed for complexity (e.g. grammar) and content (e.g. relevance, logical progression).

As a discipline linguistics has undergone a transformation in the 1980's.
In the view of some linguistics, which was once a branch of the humanities, has already become a branch of cognitive science; and it may be about to become a kind of big science, requiring large research organisations and equipment resources.
Computational questions have become central, not just in natural language processing applications, but also in theoretical discussions within linguistics.
This study will examine the responses of linguists and cognitive scientists to the changing research culture of natural language processing by analysing a corpus of written and spoken texts reflecting various attempts at collaborative research.
The research will focus especially on the preparation of proposals written in response to several key interdisciplinary initiatives, and on the papers, reports and discussions and participants accounts that are related to these proposals.
Researchers from seven universities are taking part in the study.
The key feature of the methodology is the use of comparisons of related texts to reveal sociologically significant textual features.
This will take place in five stages:— orientation interviews, to select the texts and to establish the communicative context;— initial analysis of texts which will focus on linguistic features likely to indicate relations between disciplines;— directed interviews with the participants which will allow them to comment on the details of the analysis;— comparison of texts from different locations and situations to show if a pattern of features is merely peculiar to one writer or if it may have general social significance.
The written report will be checked by the participants to allow them to make any deletions necessary to protect the confidentiality of their research.
The research produced will be of use to policy-makers, administrators and social scientists in promoting interdisciplinary work and adapting to changes in their disciplines.

In the twenty-five years since Tanzania gained political independence, Swahili has gradually taken over some of the functions formerly performed by English, particularly in some areas of education, the media and internal government communication.
Official encouragement of the increased use of the language, promotion of a national literacy campaign and provision for the writing of dictionaries and grammars and the development of specialised terminologies for higher education, have been regarded as an important part of Tanzania's search for a national identity and the enrichment of the lives of its citizens.
This research is undertaken on the premise that language is an important factor in the self-image of a nation.
The research aims to discover how successful the formal language-planning has been in assisting the implementation of the policy of ‘Swahiliization’.
Interviews with government and university bodies, as well as with a sample of teachers in training, will be carried out (in Swahili) while the investigator is attached, as a participant-observer, to the Institute of Swahili Research, Dar es Salaam, during May — August 1985.
Account will be taken of the fact that modern written Swahili developed from the written form of a lingua franca, and not from one of the ‘primary dialects’ of the East African coast.

The overall objective of this research is to develop a profile of children's early vocabulary development based upon both comprehension and production data.
Eight mother-infant dyads are participating in the study for a period of two years, starting when the infants are six months old.
The main source of data is maternal diary records of the children's language development.
The records are supplemented by informal interviews and video recordings of mother and child in free play activities.
Direct testing of children's comprehension will also be carried out.
All data collection takes place in the home every two weeks.
The main aim of the research is to examine the interrelationship between the comprehension and production of early vocabulary.
This involves understanding the nature of the relationship between a child's prior understanding of a word and its subsequent use in production.
Detailed comprehension testing will be performed on words and phrases noted in the diary records to establish the size of the pre-production vocabulary and the range of contexts in which individual words are understood.
These data will then be used to determine whether all differences in comprehension are related to over-all differences in production.
The first twenty words used in production and their contexts of use will be identified by phonetic transcription.
Comparisons will then be made between the use of a word in production and the child's understanding of that word in comprehension.

Current drugs education materials targeted at 13-17 year olds are based on two premises: i) that substance abuse needs to be approached in the context of the general use of legal drugs in society and ii) that young people should be encouraged to make rational decisions about their use of drugs on the basis of criteria related to personal health, self-identity and relationships with others.
The research aims to explore young people's perceptions of the personal, social and health risks involved in substance abuse.
The findings will contribute to improvements in the effectiveness of health education materials concerned with substance abuse.
Following a pilot survey in 1989 of over 750 pupils in five schools, the research will cover 4th and 5th year pupils in 10 schools in Leicestershire.
A questionnaire on patterns of substance abuse will be followed-up by in-depth interviews with pupils.
These interviews will concentrate on the culture of substance abuse among young people and the way these people perceive the risks involved int he use of drugs like alcohol, tobacco and heroin.
Attention will be focused on young people who are not normally considered to be at risk in terms of drug misuse.

Second language acquisition is a topic of both theoretical significance in the social psychology of language and of practical importance in a multi-cultural society such as Britain.
The present research is based on the idea that learning to speak another language fluently involves moving closer psychologically towards the native speakers of that language.
Thus, the study emphasises the role of social attitudes in second language learning, ie. attitudes towards learning the second language itself and towards the native speakers who make up the second language community.
The factors that influence these language attitudes will be examined, focussing particularly on the strength of the learner's sense of identification with his/her own language group and the minority or majority status of both the learner and the second language.
The research will be conducted using groups of schoolchildren drawn from minority and majority language communities.
An experimental manipulation will also be included to enhance the participants' awareness of the role of language in intergroup relations and thereby examine situational changes in language attitudes.
Finally, the impact of language attitudes on language proficiency will be tested.

The project is concerned with the way in which new varieties of a language — accents and dialects — emerge when large numbers of people from different regions settle in a previously relatively unpopulated area.
This mass migration has been going on this country since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and continues today with the establishment of the new towns, the most recent of which is Milton Keynes, the focus of the study.
The project throws light on two under researched areas:
(1)
the way in which children acquire sociolinguistic competence, that is knowledge of the form and social use of different language varieties found in their community and
(2)
the formation of new language varieties.
These two are seen as closely linked since it is the children of the migrants who collectively will have to resolve the clash of accents found in playgroup and school.
The project involves extensive tape-recording of 48 children, aged 4, 8 and 12 along with one care giver for each.
Quantitative and ethnographic techniques are used in the analysis of linguistic (mainly phonetic) features.
These enable us to make statements about the relative influence of parents and peers and the effect of social and linguistic maturation.
The older childrens fairly homogenous way of speaking represents the incipient Milton Keynes dialect.

This project will develop ways of automatically adding information about word meaning to computer readable texts.
Previously analysed texts have already been used as a source of statistical information to enable parts of speech to be identified in a text on the basis of the likelihood of particular sequences (for example, the word after the is nearly always a noun).
Texts ‘tagged’ with part of speech information in this way are extremely useful resource for a wide range of research purposes.
Other levels of tagging are also desirable, though harder to automate.
‘Semantic tagging’ would involve providing each word in a particular text with a tag to help disambiguate its meaning, in the same way as a dictionary distinguishes between, say, ‘foot-body part’and ‘foot-unit of measurement’.
This project will try to develop ways of doing automatic semantic tagging using techniques of the same general kind as those used for part-of-speech tagging.
The final outcome of the project will be a semantically coded corpus of texts and a software package which can be used to produce further such texts.
The project will assess various possible ways of dealing with the ambiguity problem, and this will point toward areas for further research.
For example, if we discover that knowing the domain, or ‘subject matter’ of a particular text significantly reduces the ambiguity, then it will become desirable to try to find ways of detecting the domain automatically.

The English language serves as an international medium for trade, science, technology and tourism.
Nevertheless, we do not have the basis for studies in the English used in most English-speaking countries nor do we have the basis for comparative studies.
The project involves the coordination of research terms in about twenty countries, most of them where English is the first language of the majority of the population or an official second language.
Each national team will collect computerise, and grammatically annotate a corpus of samples of spoken and written varieties of English totalling a million words.
In addition, there will be corpora of English used by advanced foreign learners.
For its contribution to the international project, this British project will compile and analyse a British corpus.
As coordinator, the above researcher will provide advice to other teams and will ensure that the national corpora are parallel in their compilation and analysis.

Up to the present time, the study of language and its relation both to processes involved in language performance and to processes underlying the activity of reasoning have been fragmented, split into the separate disciplines of linguistics, artificial intelligence, pragmatics (the study of human communication), and psychology, each with their own theoretical models of language or aspects of language use.
However now that we have a theory of communication (Sperber and Wilson 1986) embedded within an overall theory of mind (Fodor 1983), and the beginnings of a model of grammar devised to reflect the assumptions about language implicit in these theories (Kempson forthcoming), we are at last in a position to work towards the formal articulation of theories of linguistic knowledge and reasoning within an overall theory of mind.
This project accordingly plans to formalise and devise a computational implementation of Fodor-Sperber-Wilson assumptions about language and language processing.
Kempson's emerging model (ESRC project R/000/23/1220) assumes that the grammar defines a mapping from natural language sentences onto logical representations which are not fully determined (some aspects of interpretation being defined as constraints which interact with pragmatic processes).
In this project Kempson and colleagues will work on the development of a parser for Kempson's model by embedding it within an already established computational environment.
Gabbay and colleagues will develop a logical model of the cognitive processes involved in reasoning in utterance interpretation by relating relevance-theoretic notions to existing concepts in computational logic.
In particular they will develop the logic on nonmonotic reasoning and provide a proof-theoretic characterisation of relevance concepts such as least effort.
The focus of both parts of the project will be the interaction of pronominal-anaphoric dependence and quantification.

Within contemporary syntactic theory, the structure of a sentence is seen as partly determined by the nature of its main verb.
In turn, the types of constructions in which a verb may appear owe much to its meaning.
Therefore the question of how verbs' syntactically relevant semantic properties — often termed ‘argument structures’— are themselves acquired assumes some importance for language acquisition.
It has been suggested, for instance, that language-impaired children's problems with syntax may be related to imperfect acquisition of verb argument structures.
Currently influential acquisition theories provide two different sources for the acquisition of argument structure: a meaning-driven approach whereby cognitively available information as to a verb's meaning predicts the number and type of elements involved in its syntactic complementation, and a syntax-driven approach whereby information as to verb's complementation tells the learner about its meaning.
Some empirical evidence is available as regards the first of these; the present research seeks to assess what role syntactic input plays.
Pre-school children, presented with novel verbs describing unfamiliar actions, are given two types of input: cognitively available indications of argument structure, and syntactic indications of argument structure.
Under these experimentally controlled conditions, children's production and comprehension of verbs are evaluated.

Mental activity and life-satisfaction in old age thrive, in part, on the elderly having plenty of opportunity for talking with others.
Yet, little attention has focused upon the quality of such experiences; having ineffectual conversations may be as bad as having few.
The research aims to demonstrate that often young people ‘talk down’, unnecessarily, to many people they consider elderly.
Such mis-managed demeaning talk not only induces feelings of worthlessness amongst old folk momentarily, but can, in the long run, reduce life-satisfaction, mental and physical health, with valued social welfare and medical resources being subsequently implicated.
Videotaped recordings of what young and elderly say to each other and how they do so, will be analysed in ways, given the unique interdisciplinary co-operation involved, never achieved before.
Questionnaire research on the participants enables the pinpointing of which young people will ‘talk down’, in what ways, when and why.
In parallel, the project is an examination of how and why different elderly people respond in the ways they do.
The supposedly irritable elderly person is often the one who has had the gall to defend against such (often unintended)‘put-downs’.

Although Caribbean language varieties (and, in particular, Jamaican Creole) have been described in some detail, our knowledge of the language of second and third generation West Indian settlers in Britain is extremely sketchy.
It is commonly assumed that British black children speak a variety of English indistinguishable from the local white norm.
There is strong evidence, however, that most of these children are also able to produce a reasonably broad West Indian Creole.
In many situations it appears that they move frequently from ‘English’ to ‘Creole’, even in the course of the same sentence.
It is important to understand that this ‘code-switching’ behaviour does not indicate an inability to keep the two varieties apart, but is used for stylistic effect, and is part of the complex linguistic repertoire of many bilingual communities all over the world.
The present project is based on an analysis of conversations recorded in the West Midlands between British born black adolescents of Jamaican descent.
It seeks to explore the effect of situation, ethnicity, life style and sex on the speech of these young people, and attempts to provide a theoretical framework for the analysis of psychological, sociological and grammatical determinants of code-switching behaviour.

In everyday speech, we do not pronounce words as clearly as we do when we are asked to say them in isolation.
In particular, the less prominent or important parts of words are modified: thus consonants, vowels, even whole syllables may be dropped if they lack prominence, and sounds may become more like other sounds in adjacent prominent syllables.
For example, that pen is very often pronounced thap pen and did you (to varying degrees) as did joo.
Such phenomena can be termed connected speech processes (CSPs), and reflect ease and economy of articulation.
However, some CSPs eventually become ‘part of the language’— as has happened for instance, with the sh sound in nation, which is the result of the coalescence (by a CSP) of the s and y sounds of the earlier pronunciation nace-yon.
Surprisingly, too, CSPs vary considerably between dialects and languages.
Using computer-controlled equipment, the project will study the use of CSPs in a cross-section of the Cambridge population from both an acoustic and an articulatory point of view.
The main hypothesis is that some CSPs are socially differentiated in that they are not all used by every social group, and that people are more aware of these CSPs than of others.
The main corollary to this is that, while CSPs in general are gradual in their strength (depending on how fast or carefully one speaks), socially differentiated CSPs are likely to be discrete.
This is because, like other aspects of pronunciation, they may function as symbols of, for example, social status or regional origin and will consequently be adopted, or avoided, by individuals.

Previous studies of British dialect have concentrated heavily on pronunciation and on vocabulary.
This project aims to fill in as many as possible of the gaps in our knowledge of dialect grammar.
The information will be collected through collaborative teacher-pupil classroom projects on local dialect.
The results will be of interest for descriptive and theoretical reasons.
The geographical distribution of a wide range of grammatical features will be descibed; and insights will be obtained into the question of whether dialects are becoming more uniform throughout the British Isles.
The research should also indicate specific geographical regions where in-depth analyses of syntactic variation could most usefully be carried out.
The research is also of interest because of its educational implications for speakers of nonstandard varieties of English, who form the majority of the population.
The coexistence of standard English grammar and dialect grammar gives rise to educational problems, and the burden of coping with these is usually assigned to teachers.
The research will extend an existing ESRC initiative that aims to provide information on dialect grammar for teachers.
The research will allow contact to be made with researchers into dialect and education in other European countries.
It is hoped that this will be a first step in the direction of a European policy on dialect and education.

Consider the sentences a and b:
a She beat him
b He was beaten
The subject in a, b is nominative, the object in a is accusative.
No object is necessary in b.
Thematically, in a the subject is the agent of the action and the object is the patient, in b the subject is the patient and it is not necessary to express the agent.
It is plausible to assume that case and thematic systems in these simple examples and also in more complicated cases are interrelated, that the case and thematic structure changes from a to b are not independent.
Furthermore these changes appear to be contingent on the choice of the verbal head beat vs beaten.
This research aims to examine how case and thematic systems may differ in non-related languages (English and Hungarian are studied), and how they may change in the course of the historic development of a given language.
It is hoped that the study will illuminate the nature and interaction of these systems and the role that parts-of-speech distinctions and inflectional elements play here.

In many languages the form of a word varies according to agreement, case, tense, and so on.
This variation in form manifests itself in different ways, depending on the language.
Thus, for example, to mark plurality, one language may add an extra syllable to the word whereas another may simply change the vowel in the existing final syllable.
For most words in any given language, the variation in form will adhere to some regular pattern; for a few words the variation will be irregular or only partly regular.
The present research explores how this regularity and irregularity is organised in a small but diverse sample of languages.
Computationally realised models of word form realisation for these languages will be constructed in order to get some insight into the precise nature of the formal mechanisms needed to account for the range of possibilities that languages display in this area.
At least one of these computational models of the lexicon will be linked to an existing computationally realised grammar in order to explore its interaction with the syntax.
Although the research will employ a computational methodology, its goals are primarily theoretical.
However, it is hoped that the results of the work will feed rather directly into applied computational linguistic work done by others.

This research will explore a novel method for mapping science called co-word analysis.
This makes use of the fact that scientific publications are indexed on computer-based bibliographies by means of selected key-words (or concepts).
A computer may be programmed
(a)
to look at the publications in a given area and count the number of papers in which each pair of key-words occurs, and
(b)
to draw a map of the conceptual structure of the area in question by assuming that key words which often occur together represent closely related concepts.
In addition, the importance of a group's work may be assessed by noting the extent to which it has influenced the overall structure of concepts.
The method can thus also be used as form of peer review.
The study will first consider the validity of this approach by comparing co-word findings about ‘acid rain' with findings obtained by means of conventional interviews.
Second, new computer methods for analysing and displaying co-word data will be explored.
Finally, the investigators will seek to enhance the utility of the approach by eliciting the reactions of a group of interested scientists and policymakers to a range of different methods for presenting co-word findings.

This research will investigate the processes which support the transfer of information in discourse.
The research draws on two recent developments in cognitive science; the development of Discourse Model theories, and the emergence of the sub-field of ‘Planning’ in Artificial Intelligence.
When humans exchange information using language, one way of accounting for what is taking place is to see the process as the generation of a model of discourse by the participants.
Many researchers now regard discourse models as central to language processing.
Discourse Model theories assume that language utterances contain instructions for building such models.
The link between language and planning is to be found in recent Artificial Intelligence research.
The language we observe is the surface realisation of plans; plans which are designed to produce sequences of actions which will solve the problem the participants are talking about.
Artificial intelligence also highlights the necessity for other computational machinery in any account of human discourse; the ability to build embedded discourse models (ie A's model of B's model of discourse), the need to maintain consistency between these various embedded models (an area known as ‘Truth Maintenance’).
To investigate further the link between planning and language a computer model will be implemented.
The model will simulate a ‘linguistic agent’ able to generate and interpret discourse relating to a specific task.
The objective is to allow the system to respond flexibly to requests for, and information given by the human interlocutor.
To achieve this degree of conversational initiative the system will engage in plan generation and interpretation as the means of understanding linguistic acts.

Although at one time it was considered relevant only to study child language when words appeared, we are now able to consider language development as a continuous process from birth.
The critical factors seem to be the social-cognitive development of the child and type and extent of interaction offered by the caregivers.
This interaction is often culturally determined and therefore whenever it is possible to extend the previously narrow focus on westernised middle-income parents developing spoken English in their infants, then very valuable information can be discerned in the language development.
This study extends the work of a pilot study funded by ESRC (C/00/23/2220) which examined the interaction between dear parents and their infants in the first 12 months of life.
This new study focuses on the transition period from ‘pre-language’ communication to fully-fledged language competence.
However, there are two significant additional factors: on the one hand the parents use sign language and therefore growth in the infants from gesture into sign (rather than into speech) is predicted, but on the other hand just over half of the sample infants are hearing and are acquiring both sign language and spoken English during this phase.
The question is therefore simply phrased as how does the child move from gestures into sign and into speech and is the language competence equivalent in both languages?
The study will provide information on the relation of gesture and sign and speech and help to explain how the type of interaction between parents and children create the language in the child.
This will be of considerable value in counselling parents of deaf children during the early period of language development.

In 1979 the ESRC funded a three year project, in the Department of Community Health at Nottingham, to develop a measure of subjective health status now known as the Nottingham Health Profile.
This is a short self-administered questionnaire containing weighted items which express lay perceptions of discomfort and distress.
The questionnaire has been extensively tested for reliability and validity and is now used in a variety of situations from clinical trials to inner city surveys.
The current project aims to produce and field test a French adaptation of the Nottingham Health Profile.
In so doing, it is hoped to make a contribution to the methodology of cross-cultural research by overcoming linguistic problems involved in the translation of perceptions of health from one language to another; by identifying differences in the perceived severity of the items; and through the interpretation of cultural differences in scoring.
It is envisaged that the successful completion of this project will provide an avenue for future collaboration in health research between France and Britain.

This project seeks to answer a particular question: whether a child learning English and Spanish between the ages of one and three is learning one language system or two.
The answer to this question should provide a useful test for the theory that there is a close connection between what all languages have in common and how they are learned by children.
According to the theory of universal grammar, children start outlife with a universal grammar or language ‘blueprint’ in the mind which gives them some idea of the form that any language will take.
This is then modified on exposure to a particular language, to produce the child's grammar of that language.
If a child is exposed to two languages simultaneously, we would expect a single system at first which gradually becomes divided into two under the influence of linguistic input from two separate systems.
Data collected at regular intervals from the child's utterances will be used to analyse the nature of both the phonological and syntactic systems being acquired, and to test the specific predictions of the theory of universal grammar.

Work that has been done on distributed associative memory models suggests that these may be suitable for modelling natural language parsing.
In particular, they could provide an efficient and natural parser for Chomsky's ‘Government and Binding’ model of grammar, because the modules of the grammar provide filters, rather than giving permitted productions.
In fact an efficient parser must be guided by pragmatic as well as syntactic constraints.
Sperber and Wilson's Relevance Theory offers a suitable framework for the pragmatic component.
To model its use requires the ability to access possibly large numbers of known and hypothetical facts, and to perform inference on these.
Again, the distributed associative memory model may well suggest efficient and plausible ways of doing this.
The purpose of the present research is simply to find out whether it is practical to begin a project now or soon, or whether such a project should wait until there are more results from those working on the theory.

One of the tasks facing a linguist who is describing a language is to characterize the internal structure of the words of that language.
In English, for example, we commonly recognize that ‘hats’ is composed of HAT+S, that the first unit can occur alone (as the singular form), and that the second unit readily occurs with other initial units (being the plural form).
Similarly, we can see that ‘unhappier’ can be decomposed into UN+HAPPY+ER.
Such simple examples might suggest that, at least for well-studied languages like English, the principles governing word-formation are very clearly understood.
This is not so.
The current project is concerned to examine this far-from-easy task of assigning internal structure to words and, in particular, to investigate the extent to which it is possible to build a computer system which will model the procedures which the linguist follows in arriving at a description of the word structure of a language.
Such systems are now commonly known within and without the field of Artificial Intelligence as ‘expert systems’.

Now that many countries see science research as a key to economic development, the links between public and private sector science are strengthening, often with the active support of government.
Meanwhile, universities and equivalent institutions are becoming increasingly autonomous, working closely with the private sector, or even generating spin-off companies that may develop into important sectors in their own right, as with biotechnology.
The Advanced Research Workshop will bring together the leading researchers in the field of science management to determine our present understanding of academic-industry relations and to establish an agenda for future research.
Issues that arise out of academic-industry collaboration would include forms and limits of collaboration, codes for resolving ethical and role conflicts, and the role of academics as entrepreneurs.
Participants will use case studies to explore topics such as the growth of hybrid organisational structures; the channels through which small companies receive their science and technology inputs; and the evaluation of collaborative success or failure.
The Workshop, funded by NATO, research funding agencies in a number of countries and private industry, will lead to a two-year programme of further work as one of SPSG International Study Groups.

To understand fully the factors maintaining sectarianism in Northern Ireland, we need to examine the role of youth cultures in sustaining the patterns of identity and social exclusion which characterise this divided society.
This study aims to examine the role of Protestant working class youth culture in transmitting loyalist ethnic and political identity.
Field work data from an ethnography of a group of youths in Londonderry are being supplemented by a school based attitude survey which questions young people on their ethnic identification and attitudes to members of the other religious community.
The enthnography focused on the activity of Loyalist marching bands.
Existing programmes, educational and social, concerned with combating sectarianism among young people in Northern Ireland have to date failed to take into account the role of youth culture in the maintenance of sectarian hostilities.
It is hoped that the study will provide information on the generation of sectarianism amongst adolescents and thereby assist the formulation of educational and youth work policy addressed to this problem.

It has been established that
(i)
the number and proportion of women in paid employment in the United Kingdom has increased substantially since the Second World War, and
(ii)
that this increase in female employment has not been evenly distributed through the occupational hierarchy; that is women tend to be concentrated in particular occupations (for example, clerical work), and in low-level positions within those occupations.
Previous research sponsored by the ESRC (see R Crompton and G Jones: White-Collar Proletariat: Deskilling and Gender in Clerical Work, Macmillan 1984) has demonstrated that the reasons explaining low levels of promotion amongst women in clerical work include
(i)
a lack of extended, unbroken work experience,
(ii)
difficulties in being geographically mobile, and
(iii)
(perhaps as a consequence of
(i)
and
(ii)
), the fact that women have not, in contrast to young men in clerical occupations, usually acquired formal, employment-related qualifications.
(For example, in Insurance and Banking).
This research suggested, however, that there had been a recent and substantial increase in the proportion of young women gaining formal, employment related qualifications.
The main objective of this project, therefore, is to establish the nature and extent of this increase in qualifications amongst women.
This information is being compiled from the examination pass lists of the Qualifying Institutions.
The project also assesses the possible impact of an increase in the proportion of qualified women on both female and male career structures and prospects.

The objective of the research is to explore a new and distinctive area of investigation within the field of social policy — the role played by the media in shaping and reflecting those policies.
It seeks to make a contribution to our knowledge about how policy making proceeds by examining which values, perceptions, images and definitions are exchanged between politicians, journalists, pressure groups, Cabinet Ministers and the public at large.
The research will contribute towards our further understanding of the relationship between the media and the policy process.
Sixty per cent of the content analysis of newspapers and policy documents has been done and the framework established.
This project continues analysis of official reports, legislation and Hansard, and coverage by three ‘popular’ and three ‘quality’newspapers of family-related issues is being monitored.
The research will be written up as it proceeds, and will be published in 1986.

As industrialisation proceeds, the number of domestic servants appears to decline.
Conversely, in Third World countries today, where industrial development is in its infancy, the demand for domestic servants is high (the supply being fuelled by the decline of subsistence agriculture and by the lack of alternative employment).
This study looks at the labour force in domestic service in Tanzania.
Prior to independence, when the demand for servants came from European administrators, and from Asian and Arab traders, domestic servants were male, as was the labour force in general.
Today, however, when many of the employers are Africans, domestic service is an occupation into which women are moving in increasing numbers.
It is this feminisation of the labour force that is considered by this research.
First, the historical process is charted; second, the underlying causes in terms of labour supply and demand are investigated: third, the way in which what was originally ‘a man's job’ has become ‘women's work’is considered.
A national review of archival and contemporary sources will be supplemented by an in-depth study of domestic servants in Tanga, an industrial town.

This project uses information from a considerable number of fertility surveys carried out in developing countries.
These surveys are as comparable in content as is ever likely to be achieved.
Four topics are being studied:
(i)
infant and child mortality particularly the deleterious effects of short birth intervals on survival chances: this work is of considerable policy relevance, attracting attention from a number of international agencies;
(ii)
the timing of fertility, particularly in relation to age and birth order (this work is of theoretical interest, as it suggests a societal homogeneity in fertility control behaviour beyond the second birth)
(iii)
the proximate determinants of fertility.
This work extends a new approach for incorporating the basic biological and social factors immediately determining fertility (the ‘proximate’ determinants eg coital frequency, menstrual status, contraceptive use and pregnancy outcomes) into the analysis of the determinants of fertility levels and trends); and
(iv)
household and family demography (here the potential of these surveys for the study of an emerging focus of research in the population field is being explored).

This project is a study of the implications of unemployment for attitudes to work in Britain and France.
It examines the ways in which the impact of unemployment may be mediated by distinctive characteristics of the family and community contexts in each country and by broader variations in working class culture and political socialisation.
It involves
(a)
discussions between teams of a substantial body of existing research data;
(b)
the selection in the light of these of priority issues in the areas presented;
(c)
a collaborative pilot study in the urban centre in each country.

The Occupational Segregation project has a specific focus on what may be one of the most far-reaching changes to affect ecoonmic and social life; the increasing participation of women in paid employment in Britain.
The project examines the work that women do, in particular, the segregation of employment into ‘men's jobs’ and ‘women's jobs’.
Are these distinctions being broken down under the impact of wider social changes?
Or are new jobs being created which simply reproduce, in a slightly different form, existing patterns of gender segregation?
What impact will the increasing acquisition of formal qualifications by women have on existing, and future, structures?
Case studies of pharmacy, accountancy, the building society and the hotel amd catering industries have been completed.
These studies have explored employer policies, male exclusionary practices, and the attitudes of the women themselves.
A separate project directed at the University of Essex by Alison Scott has examined the computer service and retail industries.

Building on work already completed by the principal researcher (funded by the DHSS), this project represents the third and final stage of a study of old age in rural Wales.
The primary emphasis of the work is on the support networks of old people living in the community; that is, all those people who provide company, advice, help and other kinds of support which make continued independent living possible.
The longitudinal study will concentrate on stability, change and adaptation in networks and will extend knowledge and understanding of the ageing process.
In addition, on the basis of qualitative data, it is hoped to identify different types of support networks.
The data will be collected through interviews with survivors (or in a minority of cases, those caring for them) conducted in their own homes.
The study will also collect data from a small sample of next of kin of those who have died or entered residential care to try to understand how these events affected the network and how family and friends cope with crises.
The research is part of a larger project, jointly funded by the DHSS.
The research programme is the first study of support networks of the elderly looking at developments over time.

The Education and Human Development Committee and the Research Resources and Methods Committee began supporting a Designated Research Centre at the Centre for Educational Sociology (CES), University of Edinburgh on 1 January 1987.
Founded in 1972, CES is an interdisciplinary research centre with active links to researchers in seven departments of Edinburgh University, and in various institutions of higher education.
Its main substantive interests are in education, training and the youth labour market, social, economic and governmental changes; and methods of social research, with an emphasis on quantitative and survey techniques.
The Designated Research Centre within the unit will conduct substantive research and will make a contribution to methods and resources for social research in the UK.
Its main substantive concern will be with young people, with the social institutions with which they interact (eg family, education, labour market) and the practices and policies that impinge on them.
Its methodological and resource role will be to promote the research community's use of the data environment and of techniques of analysis appropriate to it.
It will offer an applied setting in which international and UK expertise in research methods and statistics will be brought to bear on theoretical and substantive problems.
further secondary analysis of extant data on education, training and the labour market, the development of a data base on school effectiveness, labour markets and change, support for the access of the research community to the extant data base; and the consolidation and extension of national and international contacts with experts in research methods and statistics.

Concern about the public understanding of science often focuses on those occasions when scientists and the public are seen to come into conflict; where, for example, scientific research is perceived as hazardous.
By contrast, this study concentrates on the issue of public understanding as it affects scientists in conservation organisations.
Many scientists are active in such groups in Northern Ireland and a significant proportion of them bring special expertise to their organisations.
These scientists commonly see themselves as on the side of the public, perhaps against state agencies or commercial enterprises.
Thus they do not confront the usual sources of public misunderstanding.
But their position is still not straightforward.
While scientists may be called on to use their knowledge to set priorities for action by conservation groups, the groups depend for funding and action on their public appeal.
Projects which appeal most to the public are by no means certain to be the most scientifically pressing and vice versa.
Injunctions to love the slugs in your garden may fall on deaf ears.
Furthermore, supporters of conservation groups may exhibit a general lack of confidence in science and technology and a suspicion of scientific ‘expertise’.
Scientists may thus even face problems within their organisation.
By examining the tensions and difficulties inherent in the role fulfilled by scientists in such groups, this study highlights problems that scientists experience in communicating and co-operating with lay persons even when good initial grounds for mutual understanding exist.
This project was part of the Public understanding of science initiative (Reference A/09)

The aim of this research is to analyse the factors affecting the career development and mobility of key technological personnel within high technology firms.
These employees, widely recognised as being in short supply, are increasingly important to the economic future of the country.
However relatively little is known about their career plans and aspirations or about the impact which non-work issues, such as their domestic commitments, household work strategies and leisure orientations, have on these.
This research aims to investigate how such factors shape the way this key group of employees are responding to their labour market situation and the career opportunities provided for them within high technology firms.
The research involves interviews with personnel and technical managers in 20 companies located in central southern England, designed to gather information on employment policies, career structures and their perceptions of the labour market behaviour of professional engineers.
The project is intended to lay the groundwork for a subsequent full-scale study.
This project was part of the pre-project phase of the New Technologies and the firm initiative (F/24)

This project made possible: a) an extensive literature review; b) an investigation of the availability for local labour markets of secondary data on training provision and ‘skill’ levels; and c) a pilot telephone survey of a sample of employers in Mid Glamorgan on their recruitment and training strategies.
One of the most interesting conclusions to result from this preliminary investigation is that there is very little good quality information available on training provision and ‘skill’ levels at the local level.
This paucity can, in turn, be related to the current institutional organisation of training, with its emphasis on employers and the huge range of interested organisations (most of which are unaccountable); and the centralisation of the control of training under the auspices of the Manpower Services Commission.

Computers have long promised, or threatened, to replace human labour in a variety of settings.
The growth of computer based ‘expert systems’ seems to promise a replacement for human expertise.
If the claims of some expert system designers are true, aspects of the jobs of many kinds of expert, such as doctors, oil prospectors, and research chemists can be better done with such machines.
This would have great significance for the professions, and would also provide a severe jolt to our understanding of the basis of human knowledge.
The project is intended to begin to explore these possibilities by examining the extent to which expert systems can acquire human expertise.
The first phase of the research compares the way that expertise is learned in the normal way, with the way that a ‘knowledge engineer’ elicits an expert's knowledge and transfers it to a computer programme.
The field of semi-conductor-crystal growing has been chosen as the area of expertise: The principal researcher is currently apprenticed to an expert crystal-grower, while a knowledge engineer (Dr Green of the University of Bath) is writing an expert system on the same topic, using the same expert as the source of knowledge.
Complete records of both types of learning process are being maintained.
In this way, the ‘losses’ involved in different types of learning should be better understood.
It should then be possible to understand the limits of potential expert systems, and to suggest improved methods for knowledge elicitation.

The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 introduced new principles and procedures for the management of the rural environment embodying the preferred solutions of the National Farmers' Union and the Country Landowners' Association to conflicts between agriculture and conservation.
These organisations must now demonstrate that the goodwill and voluntary co-operation of the farming and landowning community will be effective in protecting the countryside and, along with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, they are focusing particularly on the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group, which they helped to establish, as a major vehicle for promoting the Act.
The study examines the development of Farming and Wildlife Advisory Groups in the new climate of self regulation, forced reconciliation and accommodation between farmers and conservationists.
Focusing upon the development and activities of a number of groups in contrasting counties, the study pays close attention to their social composition, ideology and role in attempting to ensure that a consensus can develop around the provisions of the Act.

The aim of the research was to prepare for the development of a full proposal on ‘The Management of Technical Uncertainty’.
The goal of this proposal would be an empirical investigation, informed by the perspective of this ‘new’ sociology of scientific knowledge, of how the uncertainty always potentially present in research and development is dealt with in practice.
The technical field being considered for the full proposal is inertial navigation technology.
To assess the feasibility of this full proposal, key individuals in the industry were approached by letter to seek their agreement to be interviewed.
Pilot interviews were conducted with participants in the industry from the UK, USA and Japan to ascertain the nature of the limits placed on data-gathering by commercial confidentiality and military secrecy.
Documentary research in the technical literature was undertaken to plan interviews and to identify key areas of technological innovation and technical uncertainty.
Discussions were held with inertial navigation management at Ferranti PLC to begin the process of obtaining input from the industry into a full project proposal.

Projected changes in the type and nature of work available in the economy render urgent both the investigation of occupational choices made by young people, and the attempt to influence these choices in a direction related to the realities of the changing occupational structure.
Women have been disadvantaged in the past in terms of the range of occupations undertaken and are liable to be particularly affected by future changes.
This research aims:
(1)
to discover what are the influences on girls when they make occupational choices, and
(2)
to develop classroom strategies in close collaboration with teachers in order to counter sex stereotyping in occupational choice.
The study focuses on the 11-14 age group and the methods employed to investigate the processes of occupational choice include questionnaires to children and parents, and interviews with children.
The experience of recent school leavers in participating schools are followed up by questionnaire.
An analysis of the local labour market places these experiences and the possibilities for future school leavers in context.
n
The development of classroom strategies involves the production of a curriculum unit tailored in the first instance to the needs of the specific schools in the study, which deals with issues of sex-stereotyping and women's work, and aims to expand girls' occupational horizons.
Teachers collaborating in the research teach the curriculum unit in the school.
The process and effects are monitored and evaluated by the research team and the teachers.
In the third year of the study the curriculum unit
(s)
will be more widely disseminated.

The Centre is Britain's leading multi-disciplinary academic centre for the study and advanced teaching of issues concerning race and ethnic relations.
The Centre is committed to the concept of equality of all, irrespective of racial considerations, and strives to make all its aims and objectives consistent with an absolute opposition to racism in society.
It acts as a focus for academic research into ‘race’, racism and ethnic relations, through a research programme that integrates multi-disciplinary theoretical and policy-relevant work.
Through its national resources centre, by collaboration with university departments and other academics, community-based and government bodies, in promoting conferences, workshops and seminars, and supporting a visiting fellows programme, CRER hopes to disseminate its research results as widely as possible.
The Centre's 1989-93 research programme is based around three subject groups:
1 Education and communities is concerned with the evolution of multi-cultural society, looking at the structure and responses of communities, the effects of legislation on them, and conflicts within the education system.
Specific projects include the effects of the 1988 Education Reform Act on ethnic minority communities, higher education and ethnic minorities, a study of ethnic mobilisation within the Bangladeshi community and political organisation, and participation and leadership amongst the population of West Indian descent in Britain since 1948.
2 Inner cities and employment includes a comparison of employment and economic regeneration in the inner city between London and Birmingham, a study of health and safety issues for black workers, a study of economic aspects of equal opportunity initiatives in employment, and a study of the effects of welfare restructuring on black communities and the potentialities and limitations of the voluntary sector in welfare provision for black people.
There is also to be a continuation of earlier work on the experiences of black school leavers seeking work and vocational training.
3 Migration and comparative issues includes a comparative analysis of the African-Caribbean diaspora in the UK and Canada; a study of refugees in Europe looking at two aspects: a critical examination of European initiatives to harmonise policy on asylum, and a study of the refugees themselves as they organise and express their view through their own associations; and a study of the participation of ethnic minorities in the 1990 local elections and the next general election.
The Centre maintains a documentary resources centre and has recently set up a national ethnic minority statistical database.

The research involves the comparative study of the long-term development and current circumstances of social rented housing in five West European countries and the USA.
It will involve the synthesis and analysis of a large amount of research material which was collected in the course of a series of comparative housing projects recently completed.
The theoretical basis for the research lays emphasis on the need to study the way in which each country's housing provision is socially constructed.
The research will explore the links between the growth of social rented housing and periods of societal crisis; the impact of nationally specific factors of the initial growth conditions; recent trends towards a ‘marginalisation’ of this tenure and the limits to such developments.
The research will involve analysing a large amount of already collected statistical, documentary and interview material plus some further collection of historical material from the USA.

In November 1983, Sir Douglas Black was asked by the Minister of Health to investigate claims of an increased incidence of leukaemia deaths and the possible connection with radioactive discharges from the British Nuclear Fuels complex at Sellafield in Cumbria.
The terms of reference for Sir Douglas Black's investigation were to examine the evidence concerning the alleged cluster of cancer cases in the village of Seascale, to consider the need for further research and to make recommendations.
The purpose of his investigation has been widely interpreted as being partly to ‘get to the truth’ and partly to assuage public opinion.
His report was published in July, 1984 (Black, 1984).
The purpose of the current research project is to assess the influence of the Black Report on lay public opinion regarding radioactive risks.
The research involves the following elements:
(i)
a review of media coverage of the genesis, preparation, and publication of Sir Douglas Black's Report, and media presentation of reaction to it;
(ii)
a survey of public beliefs and attitudes regarding radioactive risk, other technological risk, and institutions charged with regulating and managing risk;
(iii)
an analysis of public opinion formation regarding
(ii)
above;
(iv)
an analysis of any discernible effects on public opinion of the Black Report and the way it was presented, with suggestions as to other ways it might have been presented.

Research summary: The study built on the tradition of ethnographic studies of the occupational culture and routine decisions and conduct of rank-and-file police officers, and extended the cumulative knowledge by exploring the case of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.
This afforded the opportunity to examine, for the first time, the accomplishment of ‘normal policing’ in a divided society.
The research showed that while there is a great similarity in routine policing in Northern Ireland and more socially integrated societies, despite the common sense image of policing in the province, routine policing is affected by Northern Ireland's social and communal division.
The effects showed themselves in the occupational culture of the force, in senses of threat and danger among members, and in a range of low-key security duties which merged with routine police work.

The starting point of the research is the fact that very little formal school derived knowledge may be used in discussion of pupils' reactions to scientific issues in the public domain.
This may be due to inadequate learning but recent research suggests there is a severe disjunction between what is learned in formal science lessons and what is used in more social and affective situations.
The proposed research is designed to complement the PUS phase I survey of 11-16-year-olds.
It will examine 16-18 year-old pupils' responses to arguments about science-based social issues as presented in video/TV programmes, through small group discussions and relate this to two types of science course being taken at school by students of comparable ability — Science, Technology and Society (STS) courses, and more formal science courses.
The main research data from the study takes the form of the recorded discussions of the students.
Nine schools have taken part and the discussions to date transcribed, in total some 50 discussions of lengths varying from 3 to 25 minutes.
These transcripts are being analysed with reference to the origin of and nature of the knowledge used, the reaching of a consensus, and the social dynamics within the group.
In addition, however, pre- and post- tests of student attitudes will be taken to compare the effects of short courses on attitudes with a considerable body of US research data.
Some dissemination of the work so far has already taken place with presentations at the annual meeting of the Association for Science Education and at Oxford University Department of Educational Studies.
Results of this work should contribute to our understanding of: the formation of attitudes and opinions on science amongst young people; effective teaching approaches for STS; the contribution of television to learning and to attitude development; and the development of group social skills when triggered by television.

Men are involved in positive action for sex equality both actively and passively.
Some are instigators or formulators of such programmes.
But the more effective positive action in correcting women's past disadvantage, the more men as a whole are obliged to face unprecedented competition for access to certain occupations and grades.
Men are experiencing these pressures in the context of the changes in structure of employment, with the introduction of new technologies and high levels of unemployment.
the new expectations of women at work are also reflected in changed expectations of men in domestic life and relationships.
Three institutions are proposed for case study: a large private firm; a civil service department; and a national trade union.
Each has been among the leaders in positive action and now welcomes an examination of impediments to change.
One hundred men will be interviewed in depth during the course of the two year qualitative study.
The policy-orientation of the research should enable it to identify the most productive approaches to equality.
Theoretically it should contribute to an understanding of the social construction of gender ordering of institutions.

The research aims to examine the processes and structures which influence the production of science information in the mass media, and to provide a systematic analysis of the extent and nature of images of science across different media and genres.
The study will seek to fill a gap in the research literature concerning both the extent of science coverage in the mass media and an understanding of the factors which influence the selection and presentation of science to a wider media audience.
Such factors range from the type and media orientation of scientific sources to the particular requirements of different media formats and the professional values and organisational constraints of journalists and editors.
In focusing on the criteria of selection and presentation of science in the mass media, the study will contribute to the wider current debate and research effort into sources and media for the public understanding of science.
The research will involve three main empirical components: 1) an analysis of the extent and nature of science coverage in television, radio, and newspapers; 2) interviews with science writers, journalists, editors and other media professionals involved in the production of science in the media; and 3) a survey of sources of scientific information

Building society mortgage arrears have risen considerably in the last few years.
Unemployment, matrimonial disruption and financial over commitment have each been suggested as likely contributors to the development of arrears, but little certainty exists as to the relative significance of these factors.
The research aims to document the range of factors that give rise to arrears, as identified by the borrower.
In addition, the borrower's response to the arrears situation, the steps taken when confronted with arrears, and the nature of the interaction with the building society will be considered.
A cohort of borrowers, each three months in arrears, will be established.
The principal method of data collection will be a series of interviews with the members of the cohort.
In addition to exploring the influences upon arrears, this approach will allow the course of arrears to be traced over a period of time.

The research focuses on community credit unions.
These are cooperative credit societies set up and controlled by local people from a defined geographical area.
They depend heavily on local mutual aid and are staffed largely by volunteers.
These organisations function as community banks where local residents save regularly and can access credit at very low rates of interest.
Community credit unions are relatively new institutions in the UK context although they are longer established and more powerful bodies in other countries.
In recent years the number of initiatives have been increasing rapidly with development concentrated in deprived urban communities.
Preliminary research supported by the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust pointed to a number of potentially important economic and social contributions credit unions might be making in their localities.
These include involving relatively large numbers of local people in active neighbourhood roles and catering for disadvantaged groups such as the unemployed and individuals unable to obtain credit from conventional sources.
The research will explore the contributions and potentials associated with community credit unions in the UK.
A heavy emphasis will be placed on evaluating the benefits to local people.
In addition the research aims to help frame practical recommendations about how the potential benefits of community credit unions might be maximised and how outside agencies can best help.
The research will involve a national survey of community credit unions and detailed case studies of individual initiatives.
During the case studies a large number of interviews with local credit union members will be carried out.

Since the mid-1970's the proportion of older men leaving the labour market before the ‘normal’ retirement age has increased sharply.
Similarly, whilst until then the activity rates of older women had been climbing, thereafter they have levelled off.
At the same time, a growing share of those older people who remain in work until ‘normal’ retirement age have moved from their main or life-time job to another, less-skilled, part-time, temporary or self-employed job.
The study will use Labour Force Survey (LFS) data men and women aged 55-64 for the years 1979 and 1984.
On this basis it will be possible to describe changes in employment patterns, and in the relative importance of different ‘pathways from work to non-work and of different forms of non-working (eg, unemployment, disability, retirement), according to such factors as previous industry, social class, sex, marital status, health and closeness to ‘normal’ retirement age.
Although concentrating mainly on Britain, the study will also make reference to LFS data for France and Germany — countries where public policies promoting and facilitating early withdrawal are more developed.
The objective of the research is to gain a better insight into the labour market processes and labour market and social policy measures which are contributing to the ‘marginalization and exclusion of older workers’ and, as appropriate, to make recommendations which will enable social costs to be minimized and social benefits to be maximized.

The past quarter of a century has seen significant advances made by black people in the United States.
This is particular true in cities, where a wider range of economic, social and residential opportunities have been opened up and blacks have also gained political power.
Nevertheless, the investigator's earlier research in Atlanta, Georgia, shows that, in this city, residential segregation remains, the gap between predominantly black and white areas has increased in important respects, and inequality among black neighbourhoods has increased.
The present project is to replicate the Atlanta study in three other south-eastern cities: Jacksonville, Tampa and Gainsville (all in Florida).
The objective is to see how far the trends observed in Atlanta hold true of these other cities, selected because of certain similarities to and differences from Atlanta.
As in the original study, the main source will be small-areas census and other data, with measures of inequality calculated from these indicators.
What is observed will be related to wider regional and national trends in urban America at a more general level, and to the process of economics, social and political change within the specific cities under investigation.

The British Coal Industry is made up of two sectors — the deep mines which are publicly owned and managed and the open-cast mines which are run by private companies on behalf of British Coal.
In addition, there exists a small private sector where coal companies operate their own small mines under a licencing arrangement with state industry.
Over the past three years a large number of deep mines have closed, while at the same time there has been pressure to develop and expand the open-cast and private sectors of the industry.
These issues were discussed in some detail by the Select Committee on the Coal Industry.
They have also been discussed at planning inquiries across the coal fields as mineral planning authorities have come to conflict with both British Coal's open-cast Executive and the private operators.
On these occasions (as with the Select Committee) evidence is presented to support quite different perspectives.
This disagreement is, in fact, an ‘informal’ debate over policy.
It is this debate, and the kinds of information and evidence which informs it — which forms the focus of this project.
Disagreement exists over the pattern of demand for coal, the kinds of supplies available and the best ways of meeting supply and demand.
In addition, the social, employment and environmental consequences of open cast mining are the subjects of quite varied interpretations.
In order to develop this discussion the project will produce a detailed systematic, publicly available set of data on the coal industry.
This data will be used as a background to interviews and discussions with key individuals and groups involved in the decision making process.
In this way the project will generate a series of policy documents which will hopefully serve as a focus of discussions for the policy debate.

The research is aimed at identifying middle class fractions in three case study areas (Gower, Stroud and rural Berkshire), and then evaluating the differential impact of these fractions on their local economies.
There are four major objectives: i) to investigate the channels of middle class entry into the case study rural areas, for example employer and developer activities leading to the influx of identifiable class fractions.
ii) to examine the characteristics of different fractions of the middle class, using indicators such as length of residence, income, consumption patterns, labour market characteristics, etc. iii) to ass the impact of different middle class fractions on the local economy.
iv) to asses the degree of infiltration and influence experienced by the various middle class fractions on local economic policy-making agencies.
Following an extensive review of secondary data, the research will use detailed ethnographic investigative techniques in the study areas, backed up by a carefully structured survey of adults in middle class households.
The information gained from this research will afford a series of policy-related outcomes: a framework for understanding different elements of the middle class; a better understanding for policy-makers of the impact of in-migrant middle classes on the local economy; guidelines on the impact of these class fractions on policy-making institutions; and an understanding of the multiplier effects of a middle class influx.

The study will consider whether privatisation has the social and political effects which have sometimes been claimed for it.
Is it the case, for example, that when employees buy shares, they come to identify more strongly with their company?
Do people who buy privatization stock see themselves as establishing a stake in the economy?
Do consumers of privatised companies experience any change in the quality of the service or the responsiveness of officials?
The study will also consider some of the wider implications of the development of what has been termed ‘popular capitalism’?
Do the twenty per cent of people who now own shares vote differently as a result?
Do they go on to buy other stock, or do they sell quickly for a swift profit?
And how popular will share sales now be in the wake of the stock market collapse and the losses sustained by many B P investors?
These and other questions will be explored by interviewing samples of employees and members of the public some months before, and again some months after, the sale of the Water Authorities.
The water industry is a particularly good case to take, for it is a major industry (bigger even than British Gas), and the particular problems associated with selling it off have often arisen in less acute form in earlier privatisations — eg the problem of how to regulate pricing, stimulate competition, and ensure adequate levels of future investment.

The research will examine local responses to socio-economic change in two Northern Ireland localities, Newry and Craigavon.
The three main objectives of the study are, firstly to examine the nature of individual and collective responses to economic and social change in each area and the factors which influence them.
Secondly, it will evaluate the impact of government economic strategies within each area.
Finally, it will explore the interaction in the two areas between the general processes of economic and social change, government economic strategy and the strategies of employers, trade unionists, individuals and households.
The research project has been designed to remedy existing gaps and weaknesses in research related to Northern Ireland.
In particular it challenges a prevalent tendency to compartmentalise the study of ‘abnormal’ issues (that is, those related to the troubles) from ‘normal’issues of socio-economic change.
Furthermore it seeks to highlight the central importance of localities and localism in Northern Ireland.
In so doing, the study will contribute to the wider comparative research on the local impact of economic change in the United Kingdom.
The research methodology comprises socio economic profiling of the two areas, semi-structured interviews with key informants, training providers, trainees, trade unionists and employers; a scheduled questionnaire to be administered to randomly selected individuals and a series of in-depth household interviews.

The workplace applications of micro-electronic technologies and their significance for technical performance, management strategies and the experience of employment are the cause of much concern amongst business, researchers, government and policy bodies.
Much of the existing research has focussed on the internal adaptations of the firm to the introduction of new technology.
This project aims to go beyond the individual firm boundary to examine the relationships between manufacturers of the technology and their customer firms.
The management of these relationships is expected to be an important determinant of success in the use of new technology by customer firms and should provide a route for product innovations by suppliers.
Overall the project aims to contribute to the understanding of structural solutions devised by firms to manage the uncertainties and risks which they face in purchasing and using new technologies.
The expectations derived from the initial model of organisation structure and supplier-customer relationships will be examined by case studies, using a small number of suppliers and a selection of appropriate customers.
The management of the contract will be examined longitudinally by a series of visits to both firms, interviews with technical experts, senior management and a sample of users of the technology.
This data will be supplemented with observation and documentary analysis, confidentially permitting.
Some of the intended practical outcomes of the research are guidelines for good practice in customer-supplier relations and an analysis of the advantages and pitfalls of inter-firm collaboration.

This proposal encompasses a series of three inter-locking exploratory studies each designed to examine different but related aspects of the perceptions and constraints which determine women's definitions, choices and experiences of the time-spaces and activities usually defined as ‘leisure’.
Commonly held beliefs will be explored through panel discussions and then examined more systematically in a survey of a sample of 700 women.
This survey will also be used to measure the extent of women's knowledge of, and participation in, local leisure and cultural activities.
A small group of 60 women will then be selected to take part in a further qualitative interview and observation study designed to yield ethnographic data about what counts as leisure for a group of women of different social backgrounds and stages in the family life cycle.
This award was part of the Recreation and leisure initiative (award reference number D/02/25/0000)

Reference to ‘facts’ is one of the most important and widespread means of persuasion available.
Television current affairs programmes are one of the principal sources of ‘facts’ about our society and its place in the world.
The research examines the processes through which ‘the facts’ in current affairs programmes are manufactured.
Its focus is the making of a single programme in the Channel 4 series Dispatches.
Its data base is documents, records of conversations among the team, and interviews with the experts who participated in the programme.
The work will examine the way: familiar narratives are used to make the programme understandable and significant; decisions are made over what should be treated as factual; competing claims about facts are assessed.
It will also study the way the views of expert participants are transformed to fit the requirements of the programme.
The findings should inform debate over topics such as‘bias’ and balance'.

The decentralisation of public services to neighbourhood level is a major trend within local government in Britain.
Making local authority services more accessible to the public, breaking down departmental barriers at local level, creating completely new avenues for staff developments — these are the sort of aspirations which explain the surge in support for decentralisation in recent years.
The research has three main aims:
(1)
to develop better theoretical frameworks for understanding and evaluating decentralisation,
(2)
to investigate whether decentralisation makes a difference and, if it does, in what way, and
(3)
to develop new ways of involving different interest groups in the process of evaluation.

The employment secretary, Mr Norman Fowler, has predicted that the 1990s ‘will be the decade of the working woman’.
A sharp fall in the projected number of school-leavers is obliging employers to consider ways of making up shortfall by recruiting, and retaining, more women workers in their organisations.
Performing ‘the juggling act’ needed to reconcile family and employment obligations does however present many difficulties for women.
This study investigates the frequent problems which arise when school age children become ill.
Health statistics show, for example, that in the 5-11 age range, more than a quarter of children suffer from a cough in any one month.
Using interviews with parents, and attendance figures from schools, the study documents how parents make difficult decisions which confront them in these circumstances, in particular whether or not to consult a doctor, and whether or not to keep the child off school.
Families of different kinds, for example those in which the mother does or does not work outside the home, are compared in terms of the ways in which they respond to the unpredictable, but inevitable, occurrence of these episodes of childhood illness.

Working relations between professional groups is the key to their ability to succeed in a common task.
The relationship between doctors and nurses has not always been a happy one.
Complaints about poor ‘communication’ have been common.
This research will investigate what produces good working relationships between these key health workers, as well as identifying the obstacles to this being achieved.
We will examine the working relationships between doctors and nurses in a variety of settings, including different types of hospitals and medical specialities.
The project is an examination of the workings of a segmented labour market.
The project is investigating the relations between two gendered occupations, each with special expertise, which need to work closely together in a hierarchical structure.
The management of the inevitable tensions is one of the issues of concern in the project.
The current restructuring of health work adds urgency to the question.
The cost and efficiency of the health care system has come under increasing scrutiny and a variety of solutions have been proposed which have implications for inter-professional relations.
These wider changes add to the need to reassess the working relations of the central health care workers — doctors and nurses.

Over the past century South Asia has been the centre of a major division between two opposed religious approaches within Sunni Islam.
In essence the two approaches diverge around theories of the person, with Reform Islam stressing the autonomy of the individual and his direct access to God, as against popular Islam and South Asian Sufism which tolerate a wide range of ritual customs, accommodate to wordly hierarchies of ranking and power, and are based on notions of mediation with God by Saints possessing divine secret knowledge and intercessionary powers.
The present research is intended to study the expression of this division and its organisational forms in the South Asian Muslim community in Britain.
The study will examine contrasting concepts of personhood and moral conduct in relation to the body, gender and gender relationships caste and political leadership, as these emerge in the context of religious and political debates and in the expressed beliefs of religious and lay members of the community.
The importance of the research lies in the controversey's impact on the communal life of British Muslims.
The controversy is not simply theoretical or scholarly: It is a source of continuous communal conflict.
In some cases it has led to violent confrontations requiring police intervention.
The remarkable expansion in the number of mosques in Britain stems directly from this major religious confrontation, and from the development of Sufi orders in Britain.
In studying these orders and the controversy they are involved in, the research will examine a process which represents a major development in the character of religious pluralism in this country.

This is a study of how the speed of technology change interacts with the development of market structure.
The particular focus of interest is on the way in which very rapid technology change influences the firm's market ‘participation’— defined in the broadest sense, to include product strategy, pre-announcements, patenting and licencing — and hence affects market structure.
The key theme in this study is the suggestion that for any given sequence of changes in technology, the speed at which change takes place may influence the ultimate market structure.
There are three parts to the study.
(a)
A contribution to the theoretical analysis of how the speed of technology change interacts with the development of market structure.
(b)
Several detailed case studies of how differing rates of technology change in different markets influence participation decisions, and hence market structure.
(c)
A broader economic analysis [over a range of markets]of secondary data on the pace of technology change and market structure.
The firms and markets studied would come from the following industries: personal computers, microelectronics, software, and broadcasting services.

The unearthing of the extent of sexual abuse of children has shocked many people in a number of western countries during the 1980s.
Whilst we know it is much more common than previously thought, we do not know how common it is.
The research aims to begin exploring this neglected issue, building on whilst adapting methods used by researchers in the US.
The investigation will explore: ways of asking about sensitive issues; the prevalence of a number of forms of sexual abuse (for example, incest, rape, involvement in pornography); whether the abuse was reported to anyone; what coping strategies were used at a time; and what the impact has been over time.
The principle method of investigation will be a self-report questionnaire, to be completed by 1200, 16-21 year olds.
The sample will be built up from students in Further Education colleges in six locations in Britain.

This research proposes to investigate the nature and extent of the social segregation of the male long-term unemployed in Hartlepool, a town currently experiencing an official male unemployment rate of 21.3%.
The project is designed to test the hypothesis that the process of social polarisation identified by Pahl (1984), confirmed by this applicant's small scale research in Hartlepool (Morris, 1987), and apparent in national statistics (GHS, 1984, Table 6.18), reaches beyond the household to the extended family, and to friendship and neighbourhood contacts.
Such a pattern would place limits on the availability of mutual aid, and would effectively separate the long- term unemployed from contact with the world of formal employment.
The suggestion is that this will reduce their chances of finding such work themselves and make them dependent for informal assistance on others whose circumstances are similar to their own.
The proposed research builds upon the findings of the applicant's small scale, exploratory study in Hartlepool (Morris, 1987), which found male unemployment to be concentrated in families, and duration of unemployment to be longer in areas where the rate of unemployment was higher.
These configurations were found to have implications both for flows of mutual aid, which tend to occur between those of similar employment status and notably between the unemployed, and for access to employment.

Immigration to France since the Second World War has become an issue of major social, economic and political importance.
By the 1980s the population of foreign nationality numbered some 4 millions and was strongly concentrated geographically and in particular sectors of the economy.
Although much research, comment and controversy have focussed on the population of North African origin, immigrants in fact come from a wide variety of sources both within and outside Europe.
This project looks at a highly distinctive group — migrants from the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe — who because of their French nationality (the islands are departements d'outre mer) and the organised nature of their migration share only in part the socio-economic characteristics of the foreign immigrant population.
Quantitatively, they are by no means negligible: the 1982 census indicated some 402,000 people originated from the departements and territoires d'outre-mer (of whom two-thirds were from the Caribbean) and they have been one of the fastest-growing migrant groups, escaping the immigration controls on foreign nationals imposed during the 1970s and 1980s.
This project focusses on the process of migration and the role of governmental and private agencies in shaping and implementing migration policy; and on patterns of residence and employment amongst Afro-Caribbean immigrants, with particular reference to Paris and to the health service.

In the last decade there have been dramatic developments in the treatment of infertility and artificial reproductive techniques.
Paralleling this has been increasing acceptance of artificial insemination by donor although little is known of how the private citizen and the community at large view this, in vitro fertilisation and other similar medical techniques.
Nor is it known how parents and children fare in the families thus created.
By asking those who have experienced donor insemination and other assisted reproductive techniques, this study throws light on the ethical, social and personal dilemmas of these procedures.
The knowledge and understanding gained has value in prioritising policies when guidelines for practice are being considered and for the counselling provisions which are now mandatory under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act which regulates infertility services and comes into effect in July 1991.
By interviewing parents of children of different ages, data will be obtained about how families cope with secrecy or openness about the child's genetic origin and artificial conception.
For example, is this shared with family and wider community?
What is the response?
If secrecy is opted for, how is this preserved: what are its implications?
What issues do parents and children face as the children go to school and live out their lives in widely different communities and within very different kinship relationships.
The study thus is exploring both the personal and the wider societal issues of the new infertility services and high technology reproductive techniques.

The project will consider the hypothesis that the UK is technologically dependent for the effectiveness of a wide range of defence systems on the US to a degree that is not fully understood.
It will also look at what the implications of this are for UK competitiveness long term and for UK involvement in European based defence technology initiatives.
US involvement in Uk defence technology has steadily increased over the past thirty years as the UK has sought to maintain its lead within increasing economic constraints.
Pressures to reduce the impact weapons systems costs on the defence budget have led to systems being purchased from abroad, invariably from the US.
In recent years this has increased, and the US ha become the dominant partner.
Short term this has enabled the UK to maintain a state-of-the-art capability, although there has not been the desired reduction in the total percentage of the defence budget committed R&D.
The long term implications have not been fully considered, a situation this project seeks to redress.
The situation described above raises the question of how much of the content of UK weapons systems are owned and controlled by US companies, either as a result of security considerations or as a matter of (patent) law and what the terms are under which this technology is received.
In examining these questions the study has the following objectives.
i Assess the implications of UK technological dependence on the US for future UK industrial, and economic competitiveness, in both defence and civil sectors.
ii Analyse the reasons behind the decision
(s)
to look to the US for technological help in preference to supporting, developing and promoting indigenous sources.
iii Determine which areas of defence science and technology have been most penetrated by US sources, and attempt a preliminary categorisation of how, and in what areas that penetration has been most effective.
iv Survey the legal and structural arrangements that have been introduced and/or are associated with US/UK high technology defence programmes.
v Develop and refine the concepts and theory of scientific and technological dependence, with a view to assist in the projection of longer term implication for the UK.
The research will take a case study approach looking at: aeronautics, nuclear propulsion, missilery, avionics, information technologies, telecommunications, and aircraft propulsion; areas which build upon the researchers previous work.
These case studies will be used to formulate the empirical base upon which the conceptual overview will be built.
The resulting research will address the wider concerns of UK economic competitiveness, levels of scientific and technical competence and participation in future international high technology programmes.

The aims are to identify the training needs of doctoral research students with regard to writing, to assess the effectiveness of two methods of providing help with writing, and to contribute to our understanding of.
the processes involved in writing and the development of writing skills.
The project will fall into two parts:
(i)
a survey of the writing habits and skills of up to 100 university social science research students, and
(ii)
an evaluation of two kinds of training in writing skills given to a smaller group of postgraduates.
One training method will be based on a model of writing according to which pre-conceived meanings are simply translated into words and sentences and transferred to paper.
The second method will be based on a model according to which thinking, clarifying meaning, and writing are closely interwoven, so that meanings can be clarified during the course of writing and re-drafting.
A control group will be given writing practice only.
We shall compare the writing and revising skills of the students in the three groups during, immediately after and six months after the training.
The results should indicate whether a short course of either of the two kinds of training provides significant help with academic writing.

It is widely believed that the British clothing industry is in a terminal state of decline due to lack of international competitiveness.
The research examines to what extent this is the case and what,(if any) strategies are being adopted by British clothing manufacturers to restore or maintain international competitiveness.
The research also examines what impact these strategies have on the level and type of employment in the industry and how they are structured by wider gender, racial and class relations.
Information has been collected from retailers, clothing firms of all sizes and from workers throughout the industry by mail, personal interview and observational techniques.

In the 1960s school leavers started their working lives at a time of full employment and by 1980 many, if not most would have accumulated the assets that a steady income from employment allows.
For later generations, however, the chances of getting work on leaving school were much lower and access to higher education and housing has also changed.
Divorce has become more common and the number of lone parents has increased.
Because of the lack of data showing changes over time, very little is known about the effects of these changes on the life chances and financial circumstances of young people.
The Family Expenditure Survey, the longest running, annual, national survey, will be used to construct five year snap-shots of people who were aged 16-20 in 1961, and 21-25 in 1966 and so on.
In this way the financial circumstances and family formation of those aged 16-20 in 1961 can be mapped until the cohort is aged 42-46 in 1987.
Comparisons will also be possible with people leaving school in the 1970s and in the 1980s.
The findings will be relevant to the evaluation and development of housing, employment and income maintenance policies for young people.

The question of whether social security benefits give rise to a ‘culture of dependency’ has been hotly debated in recent years.
This research aims to provide evidence on whether the experience of claiming benefits saps peoples' independence and initiative and undermines incentives to seek jobs and work hard at them.
About 100 interviews will be conducted with benefit claimers of working age int two contrasting areas in South-East England (Canterbury and Brixton).
The questions will explore: claimants' work history and perceptions of their job prospects; their experience of claiming benefits and the effect it has had on their search for paid employment: their awareness of dependency on the state on their own part and among other claimers: and their general ideas about the role of claimant.
An analysis of national attitude surveys which include questions on poverty and on the way social security should be organised will also be carried out.
Information from these two sources will shed light on the extent of ‘dependency culture’ and the reasons for it.

The research aims to provide information about the expanding area of Saturday job working by young people, 16-18 years, who are in full- time education.
It appears that many of these young people are both educational achievers and from affluent home backgrounds.
They are eagerly sought by employers but have not, until recently (Roberts et.
al.
1987), been noticed by those interested in the youth labour market and the transition from school to work.
The research will delineate and draw attention to this significant sector of the labour market.
The findings will be relevant in three main areas:
Firstly, the study will look at the effect of earning on decisions to stay on in education, at a time when more young people are postponing their entry into full-time work and when the financing of Higher Education is under discussion.
Secondly, the connection between part-time earning, leisure spending and gender relations will be considered.
Thirdly, this expansion of part-time jobs at a time of youth unemployment raises policy issues about the way benefit rules effect part-time working.
The information will be gathered in 4 city centre retail and catering firms and 3 sixth form colleges in Swansea.
In depth interviews, group discussions and self-fill questionnaires will be used.
A group of young people without Saturday jobs, will act as a control group.

The Henley Forecasting Centre predicts that by the early 1990s about two million people in Britain could be working at home.
To many this sounds attractive, implying freedom from fixed hours, strict supervision and the hassles of commuting.
How does the reality measure up?
We already know that a large majority of women who do paid work at home feel themselves tied by child-care responsibilities.
But existing evidence about the kinds of work that they do, their earnings and conditions of work, the alternatives available to them, and their level of satisfaction is conflicting and limited.
The Department of Employment research programme has produced a rosier picture than local studies or the experience of local homeworking campaigns.
A postage-paid questionnaire published in a mass market women's magazine and in the ethnic press will be used to collect up-to-date national-level data on the incidence and range of homeworking, its relation to local labour market conditions and the sectoral distribution of suppliers.
Face-to-face interviews with homeworkers conducted in co-operation with local homeworking campaigns will explore the situation of ethnic minority homeworkers, who have been under- represented in previous studies.
How far homeworkers share similar conditions and perceptions of their situation can therefore be fully investigated.

This research project has three main objectives.
First, to examine the impact of racial and ethnic questions on the political institutions in Birmingham.
Second, to analyse the impact of minority political activity on politics and policy-making in Birmingham over the past three decades, particularly in terms of electoral politics, decision making and policy change.
Finally, the research will attempt to develop a theoretical framework for analysing the racialisation of urban politics that could be used to understand the process of urban political change in other cities.
The research will draw on a number of research methods.
In simple terms the research will be carried out through a combination of library and archival research, reading of reports and committee papers, semi-structured interviews, structured interviews, participant observation and sitting in on meetings of relevant committees and groups.
The research will provide a basis for assessing the nature of the politics of race at the local level.

Social and economic inequality have long been features of our society, but such inequality does not always have the same implications for health status.
Changes in the relationship between health and wealth occur over time and between regions, along with economic, political and cultural development.
Understanding the dynamics of such change is part and parcel of designing effective social policy for the future.
This research project seeks to understand changes in the social causation of disease, from the 1950Ls to the present day, both within Britain and in the wider European context.
The methods used will depart from classic class based analyses of inequalities in health by using age and cause specific mortality rates for both sexes to look historically at the relationship between patterns of disease, standards of living, eating, drinking and smoking habits, and health service inputs.
Both cohort and cross sectional mortality data form the basis for the A European study; the British study is founded on regional comparison.
Policy implications for the reduction of inequalities in health will be considered in the light of these comparison.
Emphasis will be placed on either improving standards of living, or behavioural change, or an enhancement of preventive role of both health and social services.

Data from the Child Health and Education Study, a national longitudinal survey of 12,000 children from birth to 10 years, will be used to investigate social processes which increase or decrease the risk of different behaviour disorders at 10 years of age.
Behavioural item check lists were completed by the mothers and teachers which provided assessments of several different behavioural dimensions and behavioural changes over a 5 year period will be analysed with respect to specific life events, life circumstances and primary school experience.
Multivariate statistical methods will be used to test competing hypotheses concerning the degree to which different social, family and school experiences influence children's behaviour at home and in the school, and to investigate the effects of behaviour disorder on educational achievement.
The study will be concerned not only with the social processes which provoke behaviour disorder, but will also test the hypothesis that improved social and family circumstances, and a positive school environment, can effectively reduce the risk of deviance.
The results of the research will be of value to teachers, educational psychologists and other professionals concerned with children's emotional and educational development by disclosing social processes that increase or decrease the risk of behavioural deviance, and how behavioural changes affect educational achievement.

Casual observation, as well as recent research, reveals that women and men have different relationships to technology.
Men tend to have the technological skills that enable command of technology, women simply to operate equipment or assemble its components.
Women have little presence in or influence over technological design.
Technology even enters into our gender identity, it is seen as manly (not feminine) to be technically-oriented.
The research sets out to study the introduction of a new domestic technology the microwave oven, tracing its life-trajectory through a string of case studies.
First, the aim in which it is designed and manufactured; second, the retail chain that distributes it; and third, the households in which it is finally used.
En route, interviews will also be carried out with other actors in the network contributing to the introduction of this innovatory cooking process; the advertisers, cookery magazines, consumer protection bodies etc.
We will be observing the gender relations that these technology relations embody: the sexual division of labour, relative earnings, opportunity, skill, authority, leisure.
How are the engineered artifact and the traditional process of cooking represented in words and images and are these representations gendered masculine or feminine?
Can we see gender being socially constructed along with the technology?
The project also contains a cross-national component.
Researchers in 9 other countries are carrying out similar research on other artifacts.
The UK researcher will analyse the cultural differences observable in the concept of gender, in understandings of technology and the ways in which new technologies are mediating relationships between work and home, production and domestic life.
Research methodology in the different projects will also be compared.

This project sets out to discover how members of higher-income households decide who takes employment, of what kind, for what hours and on what terms.
The researchers will be investigating the factors that influence these decisions as well as the decision-making process itself.
This is a small scale (40 households) qualitative study using extensive interviews to analyse how individuals construct their decisions and how couples negotiate them together (or not as the case may be).
It follows an earlier ESRC funded study of how members of low- income households make decisions about employment.
The results of that study are still being analysed but a number of interesting though tentative conclusions are emerging.
The new project will also allow the researchers to develop an analysis of how (if at all) higher-income households' decision-making differs from the process in poorer families and how factors such as tax and social security considerations affect the two groups.
The research is being undertaken on an inter-disciplinary basis and the two principal investigators are an economist and a social policy specialist.

This research grew out of an earlier project (funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the History of the University of Oxford) to collect data on the social origins, university experience and career destination of a stratified 10% sample of Oxford University's twentieth century members.
ESRC funding enabled the research team to classify and analyse biographical material that had already been collected for the 1900-39 cohorts through record search and postal questionnaire for the 1940-67 cohorts.
It also enabled us to extend the survey to include Oxford matriculants between 1970 and 1979, so that our 10% sample now covers the c.170,000 individuals who attended the university between 1900 and 1979.
A survey was also conducted of senior members for the three years 1937/8, 1957/8, and 1976/7.
The material is presented in machine-readable form, and the completed questionnaires include rich autobiographical data from respondents who chose to complete the optional open-ended question about their experience.
Preliminary and selected findings will appear in volume 8 of History, which will probably be published by Oxford University in 1993.

The expansion of home ownership in Britain means that many more people now have substantial assets to dispose of after their death, or perhaps during their lifetime.
Conversely, many younger people will be the first generation in their family who can expect to inherit substantial amounts.
However there are several complicating factors in this situation.
There is increasing pressure on people to plan for their own old age, possibly using their assets to purchase suitable accommodation and personal care.
At the same time, rising rates of divorce and remarriage have made the division of assets within families more complex.
This research aims to find out how families handle these matters concerning inheritance of property in the circumstances of the 1990s.
Do people have clear beliefs and expectations about who should inherit, and how assets should be divided?
Are these matters discussed openly in families, or alluded to indirectly?
Do expectations about inheritance get linked with other responsibilities in families, for example, responsibility for the care of an elderly person?
The project consists of three linked studies: in-depth interviews with 100 members of the general population; exploratory interviews with 30 solicitors who work in the field of probate; examination of a sample of 1,000 wills, drawn from a 40 year period.

Although a great deal of work has been done in the historical demography of the developed world relatively little research has been carried out in relation to the corresponding (i.e. pre-demographic transition) period in the Third World.
Demographic transition is the movement from the high birth and death rates of former times to a ‘modern’ regime of low birth and death rates.
The general problem is one of data: very often there are simply none available at all; where data are available these are often of poor quality.
Reasonable data from registration (e.g. of births and deaths) are especially uncommon.
Sri Lanka has usable data, both from the census and from vital registration, certainly from the beginning of the twentieth century.
This project involves establishing computer files containing Sri Lankan data from censuses and vital registration for the period 1926-54 and then (since data for the earlier period have already been computerized) analyzing the material for the entire period 1900-1954.
Trends in mortality, nuptiality and fertility over this period will be examined in some detail.

This study aims to analyse the factors which have shaped the scientific and technical research capacity of the Irish Republic since Partition.
This will entail a study of both of Irish research institutions and of science policy making in the Irish Republic.
This is an innovative project, aimed at combining the sociology of science with science policy analysis at the national level.
By the 1980s a certain amount of international agreement had developed, suggesting that a country's spending on research should be justified in primarily economic terms — in terms of the technical innovations which research could deliver to the economy.
But there have always been other considerations.
Research may be backed by the military or medical or educational grounds; it may even be supported for diffuse cultural reasons.
In the Irish case, at the time of the Partition, scientific research was largely associated with Anglo-Irish culture.
Early educational reforms, designed to promote Gaelic language and culture, did nothing to expand scientific training while the notion of ‘scientific progress’ had little appeal to the leaders of a self-consciously Catholic culture.
The present study will investigate how the universities and learned societies responded to these changes and will examine the development of governmental attitudes to scientific work.
Additionally, an assessment will be made of the problems created for Irish scientific research by the country's small size and peripheral location.
For example, very expensive research (such as particle physics or space research) cannot be undertaken, except by international collaboration.
The final aim of the project is to show how these various influences have acted to shape scientific and technical research in the Irish Republic and to offer a model for the study of related processes in other small, peripheral nations.

Unlike many local councils, Basildon has a roughly equal proportion of men and women in its workforce.
However, they are not equally distributed in the various pay grades.
Women concentrate in a small number of occupations and most of these are located in the lower rungs of the occupational and grading hierarchies.
The research attempts to uncover reasons for this and puts forward a series of policy recommendations aimed at producing a more random distribution of women in employment.
There are two main methods of investigation.
First, a documentary analysis based on personal records, compares the relative positions of men and women in regard to qualifications, recruitment, training, promotion, turnover and part-time employment.
Second, there was a systematic set of group interviews, covering roughly 10% of the workforce in all departments.
The study finds little evidence of overt discrimination against women, or of low expectations or low commitment to employment amongst women.
However it reveals some implicit discrimination especially amongst those in positions of responsibility.
Policies are suggested to tackle this.

This study is Phase 3 of an on-going research project with a cohort of individuals with Down's Syndrome and their families.
The Down's Syndrome subjects were born in 1964,1965 and 1966 and have been brought up their families in South Wales.
They, and their families, have been seen in 1972, 1981 and 1990/91.
The main aims of the study are as follows.
1.
To identify the changing needs and problems of Down's Syndrome adults and their families.
2.
To examine the changing use of services and Down's Syndrome adults and their families and, in particular, to investigate the match between needs and the receipt of services.
3.
To pursue the investigation of the effect of family environment on the measured achievements and lifestyles of the Down's Syndrome subjects as they enter adulthood to see how far age does, or does not, modify the influence of the family.
4.
To examine the experience of care in the community for Down's Syndrome adults in order to identify its strengths and weaknesses.
The study will monitor how far Down's Syndrome adults begin to move away from their natural families for residential and social purposes.
This investigation is being carried out in conduction with a separate study of a comparative cohort of individuals with Down's Syndrome who were born in South Wales in 1973, 1974 and 1975.
They have been seen in 1981 and 1990/91.
This study is funded by The Leverhulme Trust.

The aim of this project was to investigate the significance of gender as a factor in processes of gentrification, and to explore the interplay between changing gender divisions and urban change.
The research was based on a comparison of three local areas in Edinburgh, one where gentrification began in the late 1960s, one where gentrification began in the early 1980s, and one modern suburb.
The local case studies were developed using data from the Register of Sasines and other documentary sources, together with semi-structured interviews with consumers and producers of private sector housing.
The research findings endorse the view that non-family households in general and women in particular are important agents of gentrification.
However, no support was found for the widespread assumption that attitudes to gender roles and household gender divisions of labour are any more ‘traditional’ in suburban areas than in areas subject to gentrification.
The study shows how the relationship between gender practices and location is mediated by factors including the presence or absence of children, class differences and geographical origins.

This grant was used to support a conference and other media through which general and specific aspects of European integration, convergence and divergence in work and employment systems would be more widely known, and seen as relevant for future research, by British social scientists.
Its particular aims were to initiate:
(1)
a wider awareness and interest in these topics in Britain.
(2)
an assessment of relevant theoretical and methodological perspectives.
(3)
the beginnings of a dialogue between representatives of different national and theoretical approaches.
(4)
new contacts and shared interests for possible research collaboration between British and other national researchers.
The conference extended awareness and interest in the specified topics within Britain.
It also helped to commence dialogues between different perspectives and national approaches.
there were 100 plus participants including representatives from all Western Europe, except four of the smaller countries.
A core group of participants from France, Italy, Germany and UK have since put forward proposals for a research network under The European Commission's Human Capital and Mobility initiative.
Several individual connections and foreign visits are known to have arisen as a direct result of the conference, and a number of publications have been pronounced as a direct or indirect result.
These include a special edition of the journal, Work, Employment and Society (December 1991) and a forthcoming book, bearing the conference title, with Berg Press.

Research summary To investigate, through a case study centered on a major commercial company, the organisational transformations taking place in commercial software development.
To delineate the dimensions of the problems of effectively integrating system development teams within the software production process and to examine the solutions being sought by the commercial software company which is providing research access.
To investigate system development teams as social units and to provide a re-appraisal of the predominant organisational models used to account for the management of system development teams.
To investigate the production of a coherent, seamless program as the result of situated work practices of practical reasoning.
To illuminate the ‘software crisis’ from an analysis of the organisation of the work systems developers and to seek to make recommendations for the more effective management of distributed system development teams.
The method was ethnographic and participatory and involved working with a software development team, and research programmers.
Data was gathered using variety of observational techniques which are described in more detail in the section 12.

This research is located within the tradition of British social history but uses interdisciplinary approaches to investigate its central object of study — the English C19 middle class.
The project aims to investigate the ethnic and gendered consciousness of the English middle class.
English middle class men and women defined themselves not only in terms of their difference from and antagonism to other social classes, but also in terms of their difference from other races and peoples, especially the Irish, the Jews and the blacks.
The central hypothesis of the research is that there was a shift in respectable middle class public opinion from the orthodoxy of emancipation in the 1830s to the legitimation of new forms of racism by the 1860s.
The aim is to investigate and explain this shift using the particular example of the English relation to Jamaica.
The research will operate both at the national and local level.
Nationally it will focus on Colonial Office papers, missionary archives, periodicals, pamphlets, essays etc.
The local study, which is on Birmingham, will utilise private papers, institutional records and the local press to build up an account of changing middle class attitudes to race and ethnicity over this period.

A study of popular beliefs about fairness in the allocation of income and other rewards.
Support for the criteria of merit, need, equality, and entitlement is explored among different groups in the population.
The sample survey of popular beliefs about social justice in Britain uses a questionnaire which is also the basis of linked studies in five other western democratic societies, five East European communist or former communist societies, Japan and China.
The researchers have a particular interest in popular beliefs about market processes, and the likely implications of these for social and economic policy, notably in the areas of wage bargaining and welfare systems.

There is widespread concern about the difficulties faced by couples in marriage today.
Recent sociological research has focussed on women's increased labour participation, the unequal sharing of household tasks and childcare, and the allocation of financial resources between household members.
However this largely-quantitative work seeks to understand relationships predominantly in terms of economic power, thereby ignoring the importance of emotional bonds.
To redress the balance, this project seeks to build onto the earlier work an understanding of the role of ideologies of love, sharing, domesticity, familism etc. in intimate couple relationships.
From depth interviews with fifty long-established heterosexual and some gay and lesbian couples, the project will focus not upon why couples break up but upon how some couples manage to stay together.
Staying together entails reconciling men's and women's differing approaches to intimacy and sex, and renegotiation of the relationship through changes in work, family life and the transition from the early stage of being ‘in love’ to a more ‘companionate’or possibly less harmonious state.
Interviews reveal the need for ‘emotion work’ in relationships, a skilled task mostly undertaken by women.

The aim of the research is to document new developments in the organisation of farming in Estonia and to compare them with modern arrangements in Finland.
The two countries are close cultural and linguistic neighbours whose agriculture in the years between the two world wars was based on family farming.
This pattern still persists in Finland, albeit in a much slimmed down and highly mechanised form, whereas the incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union in the 1940s was quickly followed by extensive collectivisation.
This process is now being reversed and increasing numbers of new family farmers have been granted land from the collective and state farms.
The research will be mainly based on fieldwork carried out in two rural areas of Estonia, and documentary evidence will also be examined.
Among the topics to be investigated are the form and viability of the new farms, the problems and ambitions of the new farmers, patterns of collaboration between farmers, and the effect of these developments on collective and state farms and their staff.
Comparable material on family farming practices in Finland has already been collected and analysed in a previous research project.
The (re) privatisation of agriculture is a major development in much of eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, and the study is expected to throw valuable light on this development.
The research is to be conducted in collaboration with staff of the Estonian Academy of Sciences.

The technologies associated with the Green Revolution and shifts in agriculture from subsistence to commercial farming has profound effects upon different classes of the rural population in India.
This part of India was first studied by the researcher in 1971-2, because it was included in the Kosi river irrigation system and was therefore a special area for government support to agriculture.
The initial study found that despite such state investment, the area was still dominated by large landlords leasing land to sharecroppers and charging high rents.
However, within the village, there were signs of commercial agriculture developing among some of the larger peasant families changing contracts with tenants and labourers as a result.
Some of these richer families in the village were becoming entrepreneurial, while others still clung to the exercise of power through control over land.
Many such studies remain a snapshot of these processes of change.
This revisit study provides an opportunity to examine whether these trends have continued, and with what effects upon the capacity of families to accumulate or at least manage their survival.
The project is therefore a time-series analysis of socio-economic change, based specifically on a follow-up sample of informant households and supported by comparing wider data on structures of power, tenency and labour relations.

The research aims to identify the decisions and practices which constitute rational management in two police Forces that have explicitly adopted such rational management models but which differ in approach and method of implementation.
The project will compare their approaches, the limitations and advantages of the models and will test claims drawn from previous studies of the police which indicate that such models are difficult, if not impossible to implement in police organisations.
The study will also assess whether such rational management systems are presentational devices, as some critics claim, by assessing the extent to which management work and policing on the ground are directed at and by the rational management system.
The project will also identify good practice in initiating and implementing change, planning resource deployment and appraising performance.
It is intended to disseminate the results of the analysis to other police forces which may seek to develop rational systems of management in the future.

Until the late 1920s Russia led the world in peasant studies.
This was followed by the destruction of research as well as its most significant carriers.
Our study attempts to begin to cover the period of silence of information.
The research is being carried out by 7 teams of 2 colleagues each.
Every team does fieldwork which combines ethnography, sociology, economics and history, linked by a Rfrom belowS investigation concerning the last 50 years and more.
Each team works in 3 villages of a chosen ecological and cultural region, with 8 months in each of the villages.
The main parameters along which the investigation proceeded were:
(1)
Selective family histories
(2)
Historical picture of the village (inclusive of ecological history and history of institutions).
(3)
The power hierarchy of the village.
(4)
Selective budget studies.
(5)
Selective timetable studies of different members of families.
We hope to finalize the fieldwork by the end of 1992 and to round up research by the middle of 1993.

Research summary.
The aim of the project was to examine various aspects of the functioning of financial markets especially as they related to the personal sector.
Two key themes were investigated: the effects of imperfect and asymmetric information and the effects of imperfect competition (especially price setting power).
In detail the areas studied were:
(i)
the setting of prices and returns on assets held by the private sector especially when the debtor has market power.
Examples are endowment insurance policies, investment trusts and unit trusts.
(ii)
the determinants of the profit margin of marketmakers in a secondary bond market ie. the determinants of the bid-ask price.
(iii)
the nature of problems in the domestic residential mortgage market: the determinants of house repossessions and investigation of the welfare properties of different types of loan contract with different types of loan contract with different risk sharing properties.
(iv)
whether financial markets actually use information efficiently: how expectations are formed in bond markets and how the risk premium is determined.
(v)
whether consumers take asset allocation and saving decisions efficiently.

The scientific system in Britain under pressure to ensure that a greater proportion of research is relevant to economic development and the long-term needs of industry.
The research councils have responded with a number of initiatives and programmes which emphasises selectivity and applications-relevance in the funding of research.
The implementation of such policies depends critically on the refereeing of research proposals and the operation of grant-awarding committees.
The project aims to investigate the ways in which criteria for the evaluation of applications-oriented proposals are interpreted and applied, and how this affects the actions of potential proposers.
An important issue will be the question of whether university-based and industry-based referees and committee members use different sets of evaluative criteria in the assessment of proposals for applied research.
The study will involve interviews with proposing scientists, referees, committee members and research council officials, and direct observation of the operation of grant-awarding committee.
It will provide information and understanding of decisions concerning applied research, an area not previously studied in detail.
The project is linked to the Science Policy Support Group's initiative on the changing culture of research.

The mass media potentially serve as an important source of scientific information for the public.
The role of the mass media in introducing new scientific concepts and claims into the public sphere is important, both in terms of the extent to which such concepts become part of a wider public vocabulary, and perhaps more significantly, in terms of the way in which the ‘popularisation’ of scientific concepts contributes to the development of new areas for social and political concern and action.
The primary aim of the study is to examine the introduction and elaboration of ‘new’ scientific and environmental concepts and terms over time in a sample of national daily and Sunday newspapers.
The analysis will show how ‘new’ scientific knowledge is defined and constructed as it becomes part of the wider public discourse of the press, and it will contribute to an understanding of the role of the press as a source for public understanding of science.
Developments in recent years in the electronic processing and analysis of texts offer enhancements to, and solutions to some of the limitations of, traditional content analysis approaches.
A secondary, methodological, objective of the research is thus to explore ways of developing and enhancing traditional content analysis techniques through the use of text-databases and computer programmes for the analysis of textual data.

This multi-disciplinary programme brings the concepts, theories and findings of social science research to bear on the question of health inequalities in Britain.
Specifically, it addresses three issues.
One is that of family circumstances as determinants of mortality differentials.
Another is women's occupational mortality.
The third is social variation in the outcome of pregnancy.
The OPCS Longitudinal Study, linking vital events to census data for England and Wales, forms the core of the evidence used.
This will be augmented by data from other sources notably on income, employment and family building.
The research centres on women and children, groups relatively neglected in recent work on health inequalities, whose experience of social and economic change differs from that of men.
The team plan to develop classifications of socio-economic circumstances which pick out those most (and least) at risk of death or low birthright.
Identifying high risk groups should point towards the inequalities that are remediable.
This team draws together researchers with experience in economic and social demography with epidemiology and statistics.

During the last few years the notion of ‘citizenship’ has been increasingly and widely discussed amongst different constituencies addressing different aspects of the topic, with somewhat confusing consequences.
Following an Anglo-French workshop (sponsored by the ESRC and the CNRS) in September 1990, it was felt that further research into and analysis of the associated issues of social cohesion and civilising processes was needed to extend and inform both public debate and scholarly activity.
Specifically the seminar workshops are intended to bring together selected specialists from the fields of sociology, anthropology, political science and law to consider the implications of subnational and supranational trends affecting identity and cohesion, in effect, to explore the themes of tribes, togetherness and trouble, with especial reference to the new Europe.
The papers prepared for the seminars, and the discussions they provoke, will form the basis of a publication edited by Professor Pahl, to appear later in 1991.

Of the many factors that contribute to health and wellbeing, the role of social support has come to the fore recently as critical in understanding the relationships between peopleealth and social and material circumstances in which they live.
This project will investigate the links between social support, chronic and acute stress and living conditions in the lives of children and their families vulnerable for both social and medical reasons to poor heath outcomes.
It will use secondary analysis of an existing database, collected in a longitudinal study of social support and childbearing, to explore what is meant by social support, both in terms of family and social networks and from the point of view of the health and welfare services.
The project is linked to a study of the consumers perspectives on social support, stress and risk being carried out by Ann Oakley at the Social Science Research Unit in London.

In contrast to its substantial commitment to the archiving of quantitative survey data the national ESRC Data Archive, ensuring the permanent availability of the most significant material for future research, no policy has been developed by ESRC for the depositing of important qualitative data.
This pilot survey will contact previous award-holders of major SSRC/ESRC projects since 1965 which used qualitative interviews, in order to
(a)
establish how much significant data has or has not survived;
(b)
evaluate surviving data in terms of its potential utility for research data and/or dissemination in the future;
(c)
assess the practicality (e.g. in terms of copyright) and cost of depositing the most significant data in a publicly accessible archive.
The report will also suggest policy options which could ensure that important data collected by ESRC-funded projects is not unnecessarily lost in the future.

The concept of the market has frequently been taken for granted in social analysis and in the construction of social theory.
Recently, social economic and political developments in eastern and western Europe have been discussed in terms of the establishment of market ecomonies.
More generally, the impact of the market is often and issue in development studies of the Third World.
Within an interdisciplinary context, this conference will endeavour to open up new perspectives on and identify new approaches to, the subject of the market.
The conference has three broad aims: 1) to examine the status of the concept of the market in social scientific analysis and to question the way in which the concept is often taken as a given in social history,
2) to investigate the ways in which notions of the market are deployed in relation to ideas about the State, democracy and freedom, and are themselves equated with civil society itself, 3) to put ideas about the market into cross-cultural perspective in order to gain an understanding of how members of other cultures conceptualise, act upon and operate in relation to marketing activities.

Employers can be used by the courts to obtain payments from those in arrears with fines, maintenance, housing and consumer credit agreements.
The mechanism used is an Attachment of Earning Order.
Since 1957 the use of such orders has been gradually extended, most recently in relation to the Community Charge.
However, the nature and importance of this process have received little attention.
Despite limited information, the advantages and disadvantages of orders have to be argued.
On the one hand a regular orderly repayment system is said to benefit borrowers and creditors.
On the other hand there are administrative and financial costs to employers and potentially uneasy relationships with employees.
There have been suggestions that both employers and employees may wish to curtail their involvement with these orders by recruitment policies and withdrawing labour respectively.
The aim of the project is to examine the implementation of AEO and assess their impact on employers and employees.
The project will contribute to the growing interest in the effectiveness of debt recovery procedures and highlight the impact of debt on employment.

In recent years there has been growing attention to the effects of different types of employment regulation on the structure of labour markets and performance of employment relations.
It has been argued that moves away from status-based to contract-based employment relations are consistent with more flexible and efficient use of labour under contemporary economic conditions.
A considerable body of theory stresses the limits of relying on contract to manage employment relations.
But consideration of questions of power of efficiency in the formation and performance of different types of contractual arrangements in contemporary industrial relations are less well understood.
This project aims to investigate the scale, scope, objectives and consequences of current use of employment contracts in managing change and performance.
Case studies and a sample survey of employing organisations will provide a detailed picture of the choices and constraints facing the parties to employment relations when making contractual arrangements.
In addition, the research will collect new information on how employment contracts are determined and managed in the absence of collective bargaining in non-union settings.

Between 1982 and 1992 the conditions in which television broadcasting in Europe takes place have changed enormously.
Two major factors have shaped these changes.
First, the successful introduction of a new communication technology, satellite broadcasting, and second, the Europeanisation of the regulation of television.
Both factors have jeopardised public service broadcasters and the established working practices of their international arm, the European Broadcasting Union.
However the threat to the EBU and to national public service broadcasters has become apparent only latterly.
Early in the 1980s public service broadcasters and the EBU seized on changes in technology and regulation in order to realise the promise of a pan-European public service television channel.
This study examines the public service broadcasters' collaboration in the Eurikon and EUROPA satellite television channels, the reasons for the creation of the channels and the reasons for their demise.
It examines the policies and practices of the European Broadcasting Union, the Commission of the European Communities and of the Council of Europe and the effects of regulatory change in Europe on public service broadcasters.
The research has been conducted through interviews, analysis of documents in the public domain and from institutional and personal archives, and content analysis of broadcast television programmes.

Although women comprise less than a fifth of all known offenders, the proportion of young women passing through the courts is rapidly increasing.
This research investigates the conditions under which women are:
(a)
more likely to break the law;
(b)
more likely to be taken to court and, in some cases to prison, once they have broken the law; and
(c)
more likely to abandon criminal careers.
The principal method of investigation is the analysis of interviews with female offenders.
These interviews are directed at building up life histories for forty female offenders and are analysed with the aim of identifying significant turning points in the women's criminal careers.

The aims of the project are twofold: to develop an understanding of the role of women workers in the provision of primary health care services for women patients, and to examine the perceived reproductive and preventive health needs of women users and non-users of the services.
An important feature will be the investigation of the relationship between women workers and women users of primary health care services.
Fieldwork is based in Sheffield, and is designed to gather information of both a quantitative and a qualitative nature.
The first phase of the project concentrates on a series of questionnaires, sent to all general practitioners and practice nurses working in Sheffield, and to a sample of 2,000 women.
This will be followed up by the second phase of interviews and observation work to explore further some main ideas more closely important factors in women's health decision-making, especially those contributing to low rates of utilisation of services such as screening.

The career is generally regarded as a distinctive feature of professional and managerial occupations.
Its ‘classical’ location is within large-scale bureaucratic organisations, the hierarchical structure of which enables the upward movement of individuals through an ordered succession of jobs.
Most professional and managerial employees expect to be rewarded by progressively-rising income, status and security.
However, conventional notions of the ‘middle-class’ career are being challenged by economic recession.
This has reduced promotion possibilities and increased the insecurities surrounding managerial and professional employment.
The research, therefore, studies the implications of these trends for individuals and their families within selected professional and managerial occupations.
Attention is directed to those groups where career expectations have been high but in which opportunities are now severely reduced.
On the basis of interviews with representative samples of managerial and professional employees chosen from a selected number of private and public sector organisations, the investigation focuses upon the effects of career closure for
(a)
motivation and morale at work;
(b)
personal, family and leisure relationships; and
(c)
attitudes, values and beliefs.
The findings of the research will be presented in various academic and non-academic publications and written in a manner to be relevant to those engaged in executive and occupational re-training.

The expansion of higher education has been one of the most striking aspects of the social changes of the post-war period yet its political implications have received little systematic attention from social scientists.
Some have suggested that the expansion of higher education makes for a better-informed, more rational public more inclined to participate in politics.
Others have been concerned about the possible politically destabilising consequences of the overproduction of university and college graduates relative to the capacities of the labour market to absorb them in positions appropriate to their qualifications.
This study compares the experience of Britain and Italy because whereas in Britain the expansion of higher education has been relatively tightly controlled and graduate unemployment has rarely if ever reached serious proportions, Italy is regarded as the classic case of uncontrolled enrolments leading to chronic overproduction of graduates even in the most vocational subjects.
The method of investigation is a systematic review of existing literature covering the development of higher education, labour markets for highly qualified manpower and professions requiring higher education as a condition of entry, as well as the attitudes and behaviour of the highly educated toward trade unions and professional associations, political parties and social and political movements.
Although intended in its own right as a contribution to the understanding of these issues, the project is also designed to lay the groundwork for further cross-nationally comparative empirical research.

Previous studies have suggested that social support can help promote good health and well-being amongst adults and children living under difficult circumstances.
However opinions vary as to what is meant by social support, and how it can best be measured, although the extent to which an individual feels that they have someone to confide in appears to be important.
This study, based in the Greater Manchester area, is concerned with the provision of social support in the health, social and voluntary services.
Using survey and field observation methods, it will look at the role played by professionals in the provision of social support to families who are socially disadvantaged and will also consider the relationship between different types of social support and the ability of families to cope with personal difficulties.
The Manchester study is linked with a study based at the Social Science Research Unit in London which considers the social support needs of a group of socially disadvantaged women and children.
Together the studies will produce valuable information from two perspectives concerning the meaning of social support and how it may help people in difficult circumstances.

The project will study the emergence, functioning and success of environmental and housing protest in Budapest, Moscow and Tallinn.
The project will undertake
(a)
intensive studies of five protest organisations in each location using interviews with organisation members, officials of local councils etc., over an eighteen month period, and
(b)
large scale public opinion surveys on people's deprivations in respect of housing and environmental conditions, and the factors which affect their expression of this deprivation in protest action.
The aim is to explore a new phenomenon in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and its relation to the development of democratic politics.
The project will investigate whether Western theories are applicable to environmental and housing movements in the ‘East’.
It will also explore the impact on protest activity of the different political contexts in the three locations, and the relative ease or difficulty of organising movements in the environmental and housing fields.

To move successfully to a market society the Soviet Union will need to draw on latent entrepreneurial values among its citizens.
Publicly suppressed since the 1920s, these qualities have only survived through the black economy, or through private family oral traditions.
Soviet families are also of special interest in foreshadowing major western trends: for example, low birth rates, and very high rates of married women's work and divorce.
Until five years ago, official disapproval combined with fear to make the study of such issues impossible throughout eastern Europe.
Since then a strong movement has developed using the oral history/life story method to document the tragic experiences of the ordinary population over the last seventy years.
Most earlier official documentation is now treated with extreme scepticism.
This pilot project, initially focussing on the Soviet Union, will use workshops and experimental interviewing to establish the practicality of investigating these issues through in-depth life story interviews with the ordinary population.

This project will examine the significance of new developments in game management in Britain.
It will consider the implications that changes in the use of sporting rights may have on other users of land and those wishing to make new demands upon land in the countryside.
The project will provide an assessment of a particular ‘right’ which has significant implications for other rights to the use and enjoyment of the countryside.
The past and current state of the game and rough shooting industry in rural Britain will be evaluated.
A survey of shooting organisers will provide data on the impact of shooting on the rural economy, employment, land management.
other forms of rural recreation, land values, nature conservation, landscape and public access.
The research will include an analysis of policy instruments and an examination of available information on the take-up of grant schemes.
An assessment will be made of geographical variations in the importance of game management and of the relative importance of the game industry for different social groupings.
The policy implications of the relationship between game management and access rights, leisure provision, nature conservation and the regulation of woodland planting and timber production will also be considered.

This project studies some of the major factors which determine the demand for youth labour in Britain.
In particular, it will look at long-term changes which have affected the structure of jobs available to young people.
These changes include the decline of the manufacturing sector of industry, the growth of the service sector, and the development of new technology.
At the same time, in-depth studies will be carried out in about 40 major companies, concerning their decisions about selection and recruitment for jobs.
In this way it is hoped to establish more precisely where competition for jobs takes place between young people and adults, where young people are protected from competition, and where they are not even considered.

This study was jointly commissioned by the ESRC and the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) to provide an overview of current understanding of the two-way interactions between poverty and environment in developing countries, with a view to promoting research in this area.
Despite the considerable attention given to poverty-environment linkages amongst donor policy agencies, there is little clarity as to the precise causal relationships involved.
Neither ‘poverty’ or ‘environment’is a discrete category: they each have to be disaggregated.
The central questions are:
(a)
whether different sorts of poor people degrade or improve various components of the environment to different degrees or in different ways; and
(b)
whether particular environment shocks and stresses impose different costs on different sorts of poor people.
The study will provide an analytical overview of existing research; relate existing knowledge in this field to donor policy objectives and to global environmental change concerns; identify gaps in understanding; and highlight priority issues for social science research.

Male migration is not a new phenomenon in the Sahel.
Historically it has played an intrinsic role in the coping strategies of rural households.
Over the last two decades, however, this movement has reached new heights.
Declining productivity levels and environmental degradation have caused a widespread exodus of people to centres of economic activity.
The frequency and duration of migration is rising as environmental refugees join the ranks of economic migrants in the urban centres of Africa and, increasingly, of Europe.
It is often suggested in the literature that male migration aggravates environmental degradation as women's coping strategies are modified to accommodate the fall in labour availability in rural households.
The research project will explore:— how male migration influences natural resource management in 4 countries in the Sahel region of Africa;— whether single women are as likely or as able to, invest in long-term soil and water conservation;— whether women's changing strategies relieve or increase pressure on declining natural resources;— and what ways can projects intervene to improve household food security of single headed households.
The research will be carried out in Mali, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Senegal and will involve detailed questionnaires of female farmers (both those affected and unaffected by migration) as well as male farmers, migrants and community leaders.
The results of the research will increase the knowledge of the socio-economic and demographic causes of environmental degradation in the Sahel.
The ultimate aim is to inform policy makers and project planners about possible ways to ensure women farmers have greater opportunities to improve their own lives.

The aim of the project is to make an international comparative study of the new small scale private and co-operative sector enterprises emerging in the process of economic restructuring and reform in the transitional economies of south east Europe.
The research will focus on the development of the small scale business sector in Bulgaria, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
Sample surveys, carried out in collaboration with research partners in each country, are designed to gather information on the principal structural features of the new forms of business organisation.
The project will examine the obstacles and opportunities facing the new entrepreneurs in the development of their business activity, and will provide information on the economic performance, innovatory potential, and employment impact of the small sector.
It will also contribute to the theoretical debate on the concepts of ownership, decentralisation and economic democracy in the context of political and social reform in eastern Europe.

This research builds on an earlier project (also funded by ESRC) which was published by Paul Thompson, Catherine Itzin and Michele Abendstern as ‘I don't feel old: Old: the Experience of Ageing’, Oxford, 1990.
This shows how successful ageing depends on finding a continuing sense of purpose and meaning in life, which itself draws on earlier life experience, activities and interests.
The inevitable losses in later life faced by most men and women — in terms of income, occupation, intimate relationships, physical strength — demand more rather than less adaptability.
The new research project will investigate the roots of this adaptability in personal and work life in late middle age, and how men and women at this stage of life view their own ageing and their future.
It will be based on fifty in-depth life story interviews with a random sample taken from the British Household Panel Study, which would enable the possibility of a later follow-up study of the same interviewees at or after retirement.

Pain perception is traditionally an area of psychological expertise and the principal aim of this project is to initiate a significant sociological contribution to the study of pain perception, building on the post-holder's doctoral research.
This will involve the integration of research in different disciplinary fields, and will draw on existing work, such as the study of health beliefs, to establish a theoretical framework for the understandings of social perceptions of pain.
A framework of this nature will incorporate emotional and existential components of pain, as well as the sensory aspects.
Empirical work will be carried out to develop and standardise a new research technique using visual imagery to probe beliefs about pain.
The theoretical and methodological developments to pain evaluation by both health professionals and patients will be applied in a hospital Pain Clinic.

It is now well-recognised that the development of tourism is having massive effects on the built and physical environment of many countries and areas.
This project is designed to examine some of these effects by focussing upon the Lake District in particular.
It is intended to research, firstly, the changing expectations that have been held of the physical environment and to consider just what both official bodies and NGOs think an appropriate environment should be like.
Second, a sample of visitors to the area will be interviewed to ascertain what are some of the expectations and values that they bring with them.
Just what makes an environment appropriate to be gazed upon as tourists?
How should it differ from that experienced at ‘home’?
Third, some analysis will be undertaken as to the role played by photography in forming and reinforcing these expectations of the environment.
People will be interviewed at the time of taking a photograph and later after they have seen the results in order to ascertain just what they think they have ‘captured’ photographically.
This research should begin to demonstrate whether there are significant differences in the expectations held by different social groups, and to show whether people's expectations of the environment are regularly met or are frustrated.
Some use will be made of notions of risk, danger and pollution to analyse what it is that people find attractive or unattractive about such different environments.
It is hoped that the work will contribute to policy: in establishing the different senses of environmental degradation that tourism may engender; in considering whether tourism in fact has played a role in generating a heightened green awareness; and in demonstrating the diverse kinds of environment that visitors expect even in an area of outstanding ‘natural’ beauty as in the Lake District.

The issue of contraception remains crucial in the 1990s.
Since the 1960s, some attention has been devoted to the signs of fertility women's bodies produce through the menstrual cycle.
Observation of one of these signs — cyclical changes in cervical mucus — has been developed as the basis of a method capable of anticipating ovulation.
Despite its potential, however, currently few women actually use the method, whether on its own or in conjunction with another form of contraception.
This project will explore the contemporary history of the cervical mucus method of contraception and its reception and conceptual bases, from 1960 to the present.
Attention will be oriented to the imagery and assumptions about reproductive physiology on which methods of contraception and their evaluation are based.
The project will draw upon contraceptive research documents and interviews with practising gynaecologists, fertility awareness researchers and fertility awareness teachers in the UK.
Research questions will focus around how the method has fared in varying evaluative contexts, why it has remained marginal within the institutional context of clinical gynaecology and the cultural and sub-cultural contexts of contemporary sexuality.
Obstacles to and ways of facilitating the dissemination of the method will also be considered.

An important element in concern over environmental degradation in Africa is the effects of population growth, and in particular, high fertility.
However, little is known about the effects that environmental change and its local perception have on fertility behaviour, and debates about population and environmental change have generally not absorbed recent research in the social demography of Africa.
The research addresses the issue of why fertility is still high under conditions of population pressure on resources in as area of Kano State in Northern Nigeria, where densities are in excess of 250 per square mile, soil fertility is poor, and rainfall levels are falling.
It examines the relationship between fertility histories and household labour availability, and the consequences for labour intensive techniques of environmental management.
It further looks at perceptions off population pressure on resources, and how these affect the cultural determinants of demographic behaviour, including the adoption of contraception.
The project is being carried out in association with a group of Nigerian scholars as part of a wider study of social structure and environmental change in Northern Nigeria.

The purpose of this workshop is to face the challenge contemporary culture poses to the academy.
The starting premise is that the existing disciplinary organisation of university education is inadequate to respond to this challenge, either intellectually or pedagogically.
If we are to take account of the world in which our students now live — the world of mass media, information technology and global communications systems — and help them think critically about it, we must develop new teaching approaches, drawing together the theories, skills and research techniques of all academic disciplines.
But before we can even begin to do this constructively, we must agree on the nature — and the terms — of the problem.
To that end this meeting will bring together the most prominent scholars in the field to set the agenda for the future direction of cultural studies.

The everyday idea that the pace of life is speeding up is commonly accepted as a feature of modernity.
However, beyond locating this experience under the broad categories of ‘aging’ for individuals and ‘economic development’for societies it is not clear exactly what is involved.
In seeking to understand this aspect of social change and social integration a number of possibilities exist.
These range from whether the phenomenon is a purely subjective one tied to cultural self images (post modernism, consumerism?) or an objective and subjective one for part of the population part of the time, ie: women, parents, to a question of ‘epoch’(the '80s?).
The research does not just attempt to see when, where, whether and which people pack more into their lives but to bridge the gap between existing empirical work based on time budgets and more subjective accounts of the process.
Recent discussions on ‘time poverty’ and less recent ones on positional (ie: intrinsically limited) goods need to be put into the context of inter generational relations which in turn raise questions of equity and the emergence of social divisions based less on class than on age, gender and stage in life cycle.
To do this use will be made of the hitherto underused personal accounts of everyday life from the Mass Observation Archive.
New material will be commissioned on this topic to add to what already exists.

The social factors affecting the employment of older women in Britain will be examined in this research, which uses the work and family history data from the 1987 Social Life and Economic Change Initiative and the General Household Survey for the years 1987-89.
Women's employment rate declines steeply during the 15 years preceding their state pensionable age, in spite of the fact that childcare responsibilities are rare.
The research seeks to understand what factors influence older women's employment and their pension entitlements.
The factors which are likely to explain the timing of exit from the labour market include health, marital status, husband's employment, household income and assets, the health of other household members and the need to care for adult relatives.
The employment opportunities available are also likely to be relevant, and will depend on women's previous work experience and qualifications, local labour market conditions and employers' attitudes to older women as employees.
Understanding the reasons for the decline in women's employment after age 45 is important for community care policy, labour supply and pensions policy: older women are a major source of informal care for elderly people, yet are also a potential source of extra employees as the supply of school leavers declines during the 1990s.
Employment in the years following the childrearing phase is also important in enabling married and divorced women to obtain a significant improvement in their occupational pension entitlement, and reduce the concentration of poverty among elderly women.

In recent years there has been a considerable growth in the use of microcomputers for the analysis of qualitative data.
Various software packages have been designed in order to facilitate the storage and analysis of materials such as interview transcripts and fieldnotes.
They are now used by social scientists in many disciplines, including Sociology, Social Anthropology, Human Geography and Education.
There has been widespread commentary and advocacy concerning microcomputing strategies and particular applications.
But there has been little systematic investigation of how different approaches affect the process of analysis and theoretical development.
The project will therefore use different computing strategies on the same set of data in order to compare processes and products of different approaches.
The project will therefore be a contribution to fundamental developments in research methods, in an area where British scholars already enjoy a high reputation internationally.

Seminars in Salford, Rotterdam, Prague and Warsaw will explore the current state of, and future prospects for, democracy and pluralism in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Britain and the Netherlands in the light of their different historical legacies.
The core participants work at the University of Salford, the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Charles University of Prague.
In Britain, democracy is well established but the relation of Scotland and Wales to the unitary state is disputed.
Ethnic, religious and language minorities have also questioned established provisions in education, broadcasting and other institutional areas; and women's interest representation is a major issue.
Democracy is similarly well established in the Netherlands but the historical legacy (of pillarisation and consociationalism) is quite different.
Accommodation of migrants from the West Indies and North Africa is a particular problem.
In Czechoslovakia, the recovery of democracy is sought within a federal system in which Czechs outnumber Slovaks by two to one.
In Poland, reassertion of the identity Pole-Catholic could be ominous given the lack of democratic tradition.
The seminars will include papers on aspects of each society, comparative treatments of particular issues, theoretical and conceptual papers, and a proposal for subsequent comparative empirical research.

The social organisation of economic innovation has been a neglected area of the sociology of economic life.
This investigation takes a single case of such innovation and subjects it to intensive study.
The aim is to elucidate some of the methods by which entrepreneurial decisions are reached and entrepreneurial activities carried out on a day to day basis.
The Company selected for study is a rapidly expanding firm specialising in ‘fast food’ and ‘concessionary catering’.
The Company has agreed to co-operate wholeheartedly with the study by providing access to all levels of decision-making and policy implementation.
Two key areas have been selected for initial study, the office of Chairman and Managing Director and that of the Finance Controller.
Three sets of issues will be examined:
(a)
the specifying of areas of expansion, product development, and market re-orientation;
(b)
the maintaining of internal cohesion and control of the Company's operations;
(c)
the processing and condensing of information used as the basis for decision.
Data on these will be collected by means of a combination of non-directed interviewing, participant observation and the recording of discussions, meetings and so forth.
One investigator will be attached to the Company throughout the period of the investigation.
Apart from looking at what entrepreneurs actually do, this project has another imporant aim.
The theories which sociologists and economists use to explain business life are almost entirely at odds with one another.
By focusing on the day to day practicalities of business life in collaboration with businessmen, it will be possible to see how far what are usually thought of as mutually exclusive approaches are, in fact, reconcilable.

The project is a cross national study based on case studies of enterprise in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Russia (Novosibirsk region).
The research aims to extend our understanding of the differing effects of restructuring and privatisation on the dynamics of labour relations within industrial enterprises.
By undertaking detailed case studies in five countries the research will develop our understanding of the similarities and differences of the processes in the various countries.
In particular, the research will focus upon the following issues:— the external and internal pressures that shape the formulation of strategy towards restructuring and privatisation within enterprises.
— the mediating role of middle/operational management in the implementation of strategy.
— the formulation of independent trade union strategies in the context of changing patterns of ownership and management.
— the factors conditioning the development of new collective bargaining structures and the relationship with traditional structures of participation.
— the impact of change on the process of interest articulation between different levels of structure within the enterprise.
— the impact and stability of corporatist structures on the mobilisation at national and enterprise level.
The research will be conducted by an international team of scholars from the University of Kent and the partner institutes in Eastern Europe, and builds upon well established and long term relationships.
The development of the project has involved close collaboration with members of the partner institutes and the joint specification of aims, objectives and methodology facilitated by preparatory funding from the ESRC.
They will be fully involved in the development and completion of the project through a series of collective research workshops to be held alternately at Kent and in Eastern Europe.
The first research workshop will be held at Kent from 30 March to 9 April.
It will bring together project leaders from the partner institutes to plan and co-ordinate the research and to develop the multilateral team.
The team will present a paper to the Conference of the British Sociological Association which is meeting at Kent during the period of this time.
In January, John Thirkell took advantage of the availability of the new inter-rail ticket to travel by train to visit the partner institutes in Sofia, Budapest, Brakislava and Warsaw to discuss the workshop agenda and the initial selection of cases.
Coincidentally, Sarah Vickerstaff had already arranged to teach a personnel management course in Novosibirsk at the end of February before ESRC had approved of the project.
She will use this as an opportunity to discuss the workshop agenda there.

In both Britain and France, statistical information is collected on family trends.
There is also a substantial research activity on family problems and pathology.
But it is difficult to draw sound conclusions from it, because ‘problem families’ need to be studied alongside ‘normal families’and ‘successful families’if we are to understand how they differ.
The first aim of this project is to provide a national overview of changing patterns of ordinary family culture and relationships in Britain and France, through in-depth life story interviews with members of a random sample of 100 families in each country.
It provides for both Britain and France a unique representative picture of the quality of family life and how it has been changing in our time.
The project's second aim is to examine the connections between family life and social achievement through a family-based study of social mobility.
Hitherto social mobility research has tried to understand how men move up and down the social ladder by looking at them as isolated individuals, neither helped nor hindered by family life.
By interviewing up to three generations in each family, and women as well as men, the project brings a fresh approach to these questions.
The international comparison further helps to pick out significant aspects of family and culture which are taken for granted in one country, yet differ in another.
The project thus aims to bring together, on a comaprative basis, the study of the family and social mobility, providing both new descriptive information and new analysis.
It is an experiment in social science theory and method.
It also has practical implications for social policy.

During the last few years there have been a series of policy changes which have altered the composition and reduced the real level of income available to full-time higher education students; for example, the introduction of student loans, and the reduction in access to welfare benefits.
Unavoidable student expenditure has also increased; for instance, by liability for 20% of poll tax payments, and a ‘fair rents’ policy.
These changes have resulted in growing financial hardship amongst many students, and one response has been to seek to combine term-time part-time employment with full-time study.
This project aims to identify the extent of part-time student employment, and to understand the student's decision to enter the labour market.
New data will be collected on the type of work undertaken, the terms and conditions, and the employers' attitudes towards the use of student labour.
The project will also consider the impact of student employment on the pattern of study and level of academic attainment.

Three research groups recently announced — in the same issue of Nature — the discovery of the site of the genetic anomaly responsible for Myotonic Dystrophy, which is a major genetically transmitted disorder.
This is a major ‘breakthrough’ in medical science, and is one of several important developments in medical genetics in the very recent past.
The research will focus on just one of those research groups, and will trace the discovery and the published discovery claim.
It will examine the impact on the research group of their success, their subsequent work, and the fate of the ‘discovery’ itself.
A close working relationship between social scientists and medical genetics in Cardiff has led to this unusual and timely collaboration.
AREF:A/439/09/0492 Greater cooperation between the countries of Western Europe, recent and prospective developments in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the changing relationships between the ‘super-powers’ in world affairs raise questions concerning the future of Europe and it's role in the world in the twenty-first century.
That role will depend, in part, on Europe continuing to overcome problems of disunity and conflict, and constituting itself as a unified and forward-looking community.
It is therefore opportune to analyse, in the light of experience and in the context of expected developments and possible scenarios, some of the central issues concerning the future of Europe and their impact on the rest of the world, and to identify implications for policy.
This aim of the Symposium will be achieved by the discussions, amongst some 50 invited experts, of papers on six major themes — Europe's Future Political Structure, The European Economy, The Environment and Resource Management, Policy for Science and Technology, European Society, and Europe and the Wider World.
The participants comprise academics, politicians, representatives of business, and international civil servants.
The main proceedings will be published as a book.

The number of peoples practising complementary medicine has grown rapidly since about 1970.
Some of these are medical doctors but many are ‘lay’ practitioners (i.e. practitioners without an orthodox medical training).
There is evidence of a parallel growth in the number of people using complementary medicine of different kinds.
While there has been much speculation as to the cause of these phenomena, the corpus of relevant empirical research remains small.
This research will focus on the process of professionalisation among lay practitioners in Britain, examining the ways in which they have organised themselves into associations, attempted to increase their security and status, defined and enforced standards of conduct and training, and (in some cases) sought recognition by the state.
Because complementary medicine is a highly diverse category, the research will focus on and compare three complementary therapies — homeopaths, chiropractors and reflexologists — which between them illustrate a good selection of the issues faced by complementary practitioners and of the different ways in which these issues have been dealt with.
Information will be collected on the form and growth of associations, their composition and constitutions, their activities and stated priorities.
Data will also be collected on the changing context in which the complementary medical professions are developing, especially orthodox medical attitudes to complementary medicine and relevant government policy, both at national government and at EEC level.

Against the background of growing concern about migration pressures worldwide, recent years have seen an increase in cases where migrant, expatriate or alien communities have been obliged to leave en masse the countries in which they work or have settled.
Looking at episodes from the Middle East and Africa, this project will investigate the circumstances which give rise to such mass departures, examine their socio-economic dimensions, and consider the policy options available to deal with them.
It will draw on interviews with those forced to leave en masse and with officials of organisations concerned with assisting them.
The project will identify the groups vulnerable to expulsion, and consider the motivations of states for inducing or encouraging mass departures.
The social and economic consequences of mass exodus for the countries receiving those affected will be examined.
The longer term consequences of mass return, hitherto under-explored, may not all be negative.
Since migrants and alien communities obliged to leave en masse usually return to their countries of origin, they are not usually technically refugees; nevertheless they may find themselves in refugee-like situations.
The project will examine how, if at all, they are assisted by the international community, and suggest ways in which such episodes may be better handled.

The research is designed to examine the deviant behaviour of young girls and women during the process of the transition from school into the labour market.
The main aim is to discover what, if anything, differentiates those who commit acts of official deviancy from those who do not.
Samples of 14, 15, 16 and 17 year old girls and young women will be drawn from the records of two schools which, whilst having similar socio-economic composition, differ in their overall crime rates.
Each sample group will be divided into those with official crime records and those without.
The samples will be interviewed about their social world and behaviour, and will also complete a self-report schedule on delinquency and deviant behaviour.

Not much is known about the political attitudes of unemployed people.
Political activity could be a means for unemployed people to remain involved in society.
But it is possible that unemployment may push people to the political margins and this may deepen their social isolation.
To investigate these issues, the proposed study will provide a systematic assessment of relationships between unemployment and a range of political attitudes, over a period of 15 years, across countries with different economic and political contexts.
The period to be covered, 1974-89, encompasses two complete international economic cycles.
The countries to be included, in addition to the are: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands.
The analysis will also take into account the psychological distress resulting from unemployment, which is known to vary considerably by country.
The data for the analysis will be taken from the Eurobarometer series.

This research will explore the health needs and priorities of women in Wales and identify the various social, economic and cultural factors which affect women's health and women's perceptions of health.
It will also assess women's experience of health care provision in the light of their expressed needs.
Understanding women's concerns about health has practical implications for the development of health and social policy.
Specifically the research will: 1.
Identify, through unstructured interviews, the primary health concerns of a spectrum of women in South Wales; 2.
Generate a list of women's health problems which are generalizable as well as being relevant to specific cultural contexts; 3. strengthen the infrastructure for a comparative study which spans the developed and developing societies included in the project (Wales, Canada, Chile, and South Africa/Ghana).

Increasing levels of unemployment in the recent past have revived concern over the possible relationship between unemployment and ill-health.
This project will carry out the first longitudinal study of the relationships between health and health related behaviour; education and training; and employment in men.
Although there is strong evidence that unemployment is related to lowered psychological well-being and, over the long term, to the risk of mortality, less is understood about the mechanisms underlying such associations.
In particular, the role of education and training in both increasing labour market opportunities and influencing health related behaviour is little investigated.
This research project will investigate these questions using data on approximately 5,500 men aged 33 in 1991 from the 1958 Birth Cohort Study (the National Child Development Study).

This project sets out to explore the occupational structure which exists for women in Britain today.
Previous research has suggested that there may be barriers to particular types of occupation which selectively prevent women from entering them.
The General Household Survey for 1980, a nationally representative annual Government survey, is being used to determine the extent to which employed women are segregated into particular occupations.
Using techniques such as discriminant analysis and cluster analysis, a model is being developed which represents the occupational structure for women.
The next stage will be to use this model on data from the Women and Employment Survey, carried out by the Department of Employment in 1980.
The characteristics of women segregated into different types of occupation will be analysed in terms of their previous work histories, their attitudes to work, their occupational status and family circumstances.
An understanding of the occupational structure for women is essential if policies are to be formulated which ensure equality of opportunity with men; it also forms an important foundation for policies concerned with unemployment and with the prediction of changes in women's participation in paid employment.

How the media cover crime and law-enforcement is a matter of continual debate, especially so when violence enters the picture.
This study intends to provide a comprehensive analysis of the national press and prime-time television programmes analysing their content in a variety of ways.
The research will also investigate why journalism takes the form it does, by looking at two other issues.
First, how do outside factors, such as the law and various lobbies, affect the ways in which newspapers and television companies work?
Second, what are the values and practices of those working inside such organisations, and how do these affect what they select and how they handle it?
At this point, the research will involve interviews with people in the media and some time spent watching how they do their jobs.
Finally, the study will attempt to find out what television audiences make of some of the programmes they watch, such as the news or crime drama series.
This will be accomplished by using surveys in collaboration with researchers from the BBC and IBA.

Considerable attention has been given in recent years to policies directed at training young people (YTS, apprenticeship reform) and the need to invest more as a nation in training in the interests of increased productivity.
The aim of the research project is to examine changing demand for skills in the chemical, construction, engineering and food processing industries and the major unions' perceptions of its effects on their members' jobs and their own spheres of influence in the work place and in national trade-union politics.
In the light of this, it examines trade-union policies and strategies formulated towards training and retraining programmes.
The views of general, craft and white collar unions are considered on a range of issues arising from the introduction of new technology, on the one hand, and employers' demands for increased labour flexibility, on the other.
The study builds on earlier work on employers' associations and training policy in the same four industries.
Fieldwork is being conducted by means of semi-structured interviews with union officers at national and local level to be complemented by selected case studies of individual plants.

The object of this research is to explore the phenomenon of street life insofar as it occurs in inner-city areas in Britain, and to examine its policy implications.
Especially in the wake of the 1981 Brixton disorders, street life has come to be seen as problematic in character, as associated with youth — and especially with black or West Indian youth, and as being a cause or potential cause of riotous behaviour in the streets.
The research is designed to test these suppositions: on the one hand, by documenting the extent of street life in inner-city areas, its meaning and significance for those who participate in it, and its variation between social (particularly ethnic) groups; and on the other, by analysing the factors which give rise to it, together with the nature of its contribution (if any) to riotous behaviour.
In addition, the research involves an appraisal of current inner-city policies by analysing the prevailing assumptions and presuppositions about street life in such policies (particularly as regards youth provision), and by drawing out implications for policy from the research findings on street life as such.
By ‘street life’ is meant more than mere ‘presence on the street’.
It is assumed, moreover, that street life (at least for some participants) is not just a meaningless activity undertaken simply to fulfil a void of time and purpose.
Street life is therefore seen as potentially a meaningful cultural or social phenomenon which performs important functions for participants, and a phenomenon capable also of variation between different social and ethnic groups.
Crowd behaviour
The Crowd Behaviour Panel was set up following the Report of the Joint ESRC/Sports Council Panel on Public Disorder and Sporting Events (1979); and following a seminar in 1981 the decision was taken to sponsor a series of research projects which would contribute to the understanding of contemporary crowd disturbances in Britain.
The main themes to be considered included:
(1)
Historical aspects: a description and analysis of crowds and related phenomena in recent British history.
(2)
Social context and social change: an analysis of the significant changes in social phenomena (youth culture, media, education) which together set the scene for the understanding of contemporary events.
(3)
Public order: the nature and changes in policy.
(4)
Particular events: topics within this theme focus on a selected event taking a developmental and interdisciplinary perspective.
(5)
Crowd psychology: the behaviour of crowds analysed from the perspective of psychology and social psychology.
In all, seven projects were funded, one historical, one on social context, three on particular events, one on policing and one on crowd psychology.

Based upon a systematic analysis of 1971 and 1981 Census small area statistics, this study seeks to document social and economic changes in Aberdeen and its suburbs during a period which saw the city becoming a major international centre for the oil industry.
Particular subjects of interest include changing levels and patterns of employment, the size and residential distribution of incomers both from overseas and other parts of the United Kingdom; the changing demographic, occupational and social characteristics of the various city and suburban neighbourhoods; and changes in social class and occupational patterns in the area.
The study can be seen as a continuation of the work of the SSRC North Sea oil panel but with a more urban focus and making use of more recently available information.

An important feature of economic reorganisation in the industrial West is the development of businesses by members of ethnic minorities.
The research continues work on this topic started in the ESRC's Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations.
It analyses the pattern, significance and potential of ethnic minority business in Britain and seeks to develop theoretical approaches for understanding its operation.
Work on clothing and textiles looks at the basis of competitiveness in ethnic minority firms, ranging from cheap garment manufacturing for market stalls to computerised manufacture of high quality fashion knitwear.
This is set in the context of the changing international structure of the industries.
Studies of ethnic retailing examine how it fits into overall shopping patterns and its potential for the maintenance of retail centres in inner urban areas.
Further work looks at links between the pattern of business development and family and community structure among Afro-Caribbeans and Cypriots in North London and Pakistanis in Birmingham.
It is designed to identify the kinds of factors which will help to determine the prospects for commercial success among members of different ethnic minorities in different industrial sectors.
Finally, preliminary work is being undertaken on the structure and working of the real estate industry and the participation of ethnic minorities in the industry.

The project involves the researchers in the study of two council housing estates: one in Birmingham's inner city, the other lying at the periphery of the city.
The former is a traditional, working class district, redeveloped since the war and now housing a sizeable black and elderly population; the latter is a new, working class estate created on a previously unused site and accommodating a relatively small nonwhite population.
The approach takes account of ethnic relations, not by studying particular ethnic groups per se, but by studying the processes by which different groups on the estates — black and white, young and elderly, male and female, etc — construct and destroy relationships; and the influences on the processes exerted by the respective communities.
The researchers use a combination of survey methods and participant-observation.

In both Britain and France, several studies have demonstrated the existence and persistence of inequalities in health between socio-economic groups (variously defined).
Yet the national contexts are very different.
This research proposes to take advantage of similarities and differences to identify potential causes and processes common and specific to each country through a series of research workshops and directed small scale studies.
The objectives of the research workshops will be to 1.
establish on the same comparable basis the size and nature of differentials in health out-come in the two countries between groups; 2. identify differentials in specific certified causes of death; 3. examine the evidence relating to differentials in accessibility, use and quality of services available to different groups; 4. document geographical and related socio-economic differentials in health outcomes and the distribution of health resources and the relation between them.
Two or three small scale studies will be designed and executed in order to test specific hypotheses developed on the basis of these comparisons.

Unemployment; Research methods; Political behaviour and attitudes
Social scientists, the press, politicians and the general public all thought, in the early 1980s, that unemployment, if it continued to rise, would lead to political unrest.
Yet as each statistic predicted to be the psychological barrier — one million, two million, three million unemployed — was passed, the expected reaction failed to materialise.
A study was therefore concluded in reactions to unemployment in two contrasting locations, one new town and one in the Greater London area.
The study had three main focuses.
The first was on the unemployed themselves, how they interpreted and reacted to their experience, their political beliefs and behaviour.
The second was on the employed (many of whom had either personal experience of unemployment or had close family or friends who were unemployed).
How we explained they interpreted and explained unemployment, and how it related to their other political beliefs and behaviour.
These two components were studied by an interview survey; the was composed of one third unemployed and two thirds employed members of the two localities.
The third focus was on the local community, and how agencies such as local political parties, trade unions, social welfare agencies and so on interpreted, dealt with and influenced the way in which unemployment was experienced in the locality, this component was studied by means of more qualitative interviews with community leaders.
An experiment was conducted as part of the fieldwork to contrast random and quota sampling.

Social stratification in some aspect, such as occupation or class, is one of the most widely used, and useful, ‘variables’ in social research.
This applies not only to work that is strictly social scientific, but also to that with, for example, a more medical or demographic orientation.
At the same time, this is an area of considerable theoretical debate, disagreement and, many would argue, confusion.
The purpose of this project is to examine the argument that there is greater coherence in stratification arrangements than has previously been shown to exist.
In so doing, it is hoped to provide an improved measure for empirical research that will also be more adequately grounded theoretically.
The project involves the re-analysis of existing data sets, using the new measure and testing for stronger relationships than originally found.
The main areas to be covered are inter-generational transmission of advantage, marriage, friendship, income, education, home and car ownership and, to a lesser extent, attitudes and beliefs.
Wherever the original data allow, particular attention will be given to the problems raised by the inclusion of women in the analyses.

The project is concerned with the geographical contexts of contemporary social identity with specific reference to the ways in which economic processes, especially processes of change, are perceived and understood.
Emphasis is being placed on the cognitive basis of social identity in contrast to the more familiar emphasis on evaluations.
From this standpoint, the relationships between various aspects of social experience and contemporary economic cognitions are being investigated among a stratified sample of 400 men and women of diverse stratification of positions and ethnicity.
Specific attention is being paid to the salience of nationality in contemporary economic cognitions and to the development of a set of attitudinal questions with which to assess this.
In addition, the research project affords the opportunity of collecting further detailed data on the work histories of respondents among a specially stratified sample to add to the detailed information collected during earlier work.

The number of relatives a person may be expected to have is of importance to all students of kinship and the family in the past and in the present, and especially to those concerned with kinship support of the elderly.
It also interests those at work on social interchange and social solidarity.
Since numbers of kin are a function of demography, it is possible to calculate them by simulation from a knowledge of birth rates, marriage rates and death rates.
This research project is developing and applying the simulation system devised for these purposes by James E Smith at the Rank Xerox Unit at the Cambridge Group.
It must be understood, however, that the modelling process is a sophisticated matter involving probabilities and what is called Monte Carlo reckoning.
All the relatives of a particular person of a particular age and sex can already be calculated to the 2nd degree of kinship, giving the age and sex of these relatives together with range of variation and proportions lacking.
The investigator is now extending the system to include divorce and illegitimacy and reaching beyond the second to further kinship degrees, such as great-grandchildren and great-grandparents now becoming common.
The aim is to provide investigators working on the past or the present with total kin estimates of any chosen kind, provided always that a reasonable estimate of the demographic regime concerned is available.
This advance is of the first importance to the population of the People's Republic of China, and an agreement is being entered into between the Rank Xerox Unit and the Demography Institute of the University of Peking in Beijing.
There will be meetings in 1986 in Beijing and in Cambridge, whilst in 1987 it is hoped that a national conference attended by the Rank Xerox Unit will introduce the whole of China to the techniques and analysis.
It is the drastic reduction in kinship links, and especially those supporting the elderly, consequent upon the fall in fertility brought about by the one-child policy, which makes the project significant to the ageing process in the world's oldest political society.
This last will be of value to the Cambridge Group itself, which has been the pioneer in the history of the family.
It is believed that this is the first such interchange to be arranged between a British or a European social research group and one in the People's Republic of China.

The project, in fact, has dealt with French, British and USA national policy, and policy making, across three communications areas — mass media, telecommunications, and information technology (including space).
The focus is on the 1980's.
The first major publication was a book dealing with the USA.
The second book is a comparative French/British study of 1980's communications policymaking and deregulation; it concludes by stressing the similarities in French and British policy in these areas.

This project looks at the Youth Training Scheme and asks: is it helping young people of either sex to break into fields of training and work that are non-traditional for their sex?
The Manpower Services Commission's YTS, launched in 1983, is an official initiative on a very large scale, aimed at mitigating the crisis in vocational training by provision of a ‘permanent bridge between school and work’ for any young person who on leaving school does not find herself/himself a job or entry to full-time education.
Occupational segregation by sex — the tendency for men and women to work in distinct occupations, often in single-sex situations — has persisted with little change throughout this century.
It has been little affected by sex-discrimination legislation.
It is a cause of women's relatively low pay and limits women's chances by the narrow range of occupations to which they tend to be confined.
The research will examine the YTS of four Area Manpower Boards, one in close detail.
The study will include an examination of careers advice practices, selection of trainees and the role of employers.

This is an exploratory study.
Little sociological work has been done on Scottish agriculture; hardly any of it on large-scale capitalist agriculture which would permit comparisons with English, Canadian and American investigations.
Although the large stock of official information provides a general picture of the changing character of farming, most of it focuses on economic, political and, to a lesser extent, technological shifts.
Very little is revealed about the impact of these changes on the social life and social relations of farm families and farm communities.
This study sets out to examine, albeit in a preliminary way, just how the rapid changes in the Scottish agricultural industry in the post-war years have affected those who work on the land.
A series of pilot interviews will be carried out with small samples of farmers, their spouses and their workers.
The interviews will deal with two main topics: first the continuing importance of the family as an economic unit in agriculture and the way it has adapted to changed circumstances; secondly, the changing role of women in the farm economy.
The study complements and builds on the work, mainly on urban and industrial populations that has been conducted in the course of the Scottish Social Structure project developed in the Department of Sociology and the Research Centre for Social Sciences since 1980.
It is intended that a full scale study of Scottish agriculture will follow this pilot project.

This fieldwork supplements data collected in 1982-83 by the same investigators, during research entitled ‘The Social Organisation of Childbearing in Rural North India’(also funded by ESRC).
As before, the researchers will be based in two adjacent villages in Bijnor District, Uttar Pradesh.
The main work is the completion of detailed maternity histories from about 100 women.
Focused interviews are being conducted with elderly women to explore the effects of social change on Hindu and Muslim women in different social classes.
These interviews concentrate on the impact of new agricultural inputs on women's work, changes in the arrangement of marriages (including dowry payments) and differences in women's access to health care particularly in relation to pregnancy and childbirth.
Land holding data already collected from official records and individual informants will be expanded and inconsistencies which have emerged during preliminary analysis will be clarified with informants.
Finally, interviews will be conducted with men, covering their views on childbearing and visiting patterns and social support networks of men and women, in order to complement comparable material already collected from women.

Social change; Welfare and social services
The welfare state has grown steadily since the Second World War, in terms of the range of services offered, the number of people covered and the cost of provision.
Alongside it, private provision of pensions, health care, education and housing has also expanded.
Government policies from 1979 have focused attention on the private sector.
The object of this research is to examine the structure of public opinion about state and private welfare services.
Previous work (including a survey in the Medway towns in 1981, also financed by ESRC) suggests that people may support both sectors for different reasons.
In an attempt to do justice to the complexity of opinions, the research comprises three parts: a national attitude survey, to determine the structure of attitudes at one point in time; follow-up interviews with a small number of respondents to the national survey, in which the experience of using various welfare services is being explored in detail; and the re-analysis of information from previous surveys on similar topics, to see whether attitudes have changed much in recent years.
The work will help to show whether popular support for the welfare state against private alternatives has declined.
It will be mainly concerned with pensions, education and health care, because there are well-developed private and occupational services in all three areas and because state services in them make up about three-quarters of state welfare spending.

The urban riots of 1981, the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland, and the headline-making supporters of many football clubs, combine to give the impression that crowd violence is on the increase in contemporary Britain.
Despite its obvious importance, however, crowd violence is an issue that has received little academic attention in this country, particularly with regard to long-term trends.
By looking at events that have taken place in Leicestershire over the past 90 years, this project aims to build up a picture of the long-term changes that have taken place in the levels and patterns of violence in various spheres of social life.
It is also concerned with changing perceptions of, and reactions to, violence.
Information is being obtained by reading every copy of The Leicester Mercury published between 1890 and 1984.
Supplementary information is being obtained from local histories and court records, and there is also an ‘oral history’ component.
In addition, the researchers are using The Mercury's coverage of national events and events outside Leicestershire in order to build up a national picture.
Where possible, the more significant ‘non-Leicestershire’ cases are being followed up in the relevant local newspapers, and national events are being followed up in The Times.
This use of the local and national press, together with the other types of data source already mentioned, should help the researchers to contribute to a more adequate understanding of long-term trends in crowd behaviour, and of reactions to it, than currently exists.
It should also help the researchers to place present-day events in a different, hopefully more realistic perspective.

The foreign debt problem in Brazil and the measures taken to contain it have led to a considerable decline in industrial production and employment.
In the Greater Sao Paulo region, Brazil's major industrial zone, employment in manufacturing fell by 20% between 1980 and 1983.
Approximately one quarter of all employees in manufacturing industry in Greater Sao Paulo are women, and the research is concerned with the circumstances in which unemployed industrial workers seek new jobs, and the way that job searches differ for men and women.
Earlier patterns differ as a result of both labour markets and domestic situation influences.
The time spent searching the types of jobs considered acceptable, temporary work, and the availability of alternative jobs within and without industry are quite different for men and women.
Brazil provides a particularly interesting terrain for this study because it has a very limited social security provision and few effective laws in the area of employment protection.
It should, therefore, provide a contrast with European studies of labour markets and the importance of gender differences upon them.
The investigation proceeds by means of a household survey in selected areas of Sao Paulo.
The project is being carried out jointly with Dr H Hirata of the CNRS, Paris.

This is a collaborative study between the Manchester departments and the Groupe Lyonnaise de Sociologie Industrielle of the ways in which economic changes at international and national levels are mediated by regional industrial systems, and institutions and groups at the local level.
The research comprises a systematic comparison of existing research in North West England and Rhone Alpes and studies of similar labour markets.
These comparisons and studies embrace industrial settings involving dominated labour markets, industrial systems generated by decentralised industrial growth, newly emerging industrial systems in rapidly expanding towns and industrial systems with a long industrial tradition experiencing a rapid decline of manufacturing employment and a rapid increase in service employment.
The role of small firms and of local entrepreneurship in comparable labour markets is analysed.
Relevant local labour markets are being modelled as quantitative systems containing flows into and out of unemployment, stocks of employees in employment, and durations of periods out of work.
Firms experiencing technical change are selected in order to assess the social and economic consequences of such change.
Particular groups such as the young, women, the skilled and unskilled are selected in similar local labour markets to compare their responses to economic and social change.

This research project aims to help the ESRC Social Affairs Committee in furthering its work on evaluation and dissemination of its research projects.
All the End-of-Grant Reports received by the Social Affairs Committee will be analysed to identify the successes and difficulties encountered on different types of research project.
A questionnaire has been sent to the approximately 140 people who have submitted an End-of-Grant Report to check on progress with disseminating the results of the project.
One aim of the questionnaire is to identify the different forms of dissemination and to elicit grant holders' opinions as to the difficulties and possibilities of disseminating their work.
The analysis of the End-of-Grant Reports and the questionnaire will also be used to assess the feasibility of establishing an ongoing data base of current and completed projects.
This will be maintained by the Committee to help it in its decision making.
It will also act as a service to the Research and other interested constituencies.
In collaboration with a committee on evaluation and dissemination established by Social Affairs, the researcher's aim will be to advise on issues such as what constitutes value for money in research funding, more effective ways of evaluating research and, perhaps most importantly, ways in which the ESRC can help in disseminating the research it has funded

Medical records are sources of information for both medical and administrative purposes.
At present they are largely handwritten records filed and retrieved by hand.
As a result, the contents of these records are not readily accessible for medical or administrative purposes, because of the time and effort required.
It is possible that if the system of keeping medical records was computerised, the records might be more readily accessible and therefore more useful for the purposes of patient management, research and administration.
The research aims to find out whether and in what ways, the introduction of a computer-based medical records system causes hospital doctors to alter their working practices.
Also, the research is concerned with the study of the processes by which policies and decisions relevant to the particular computer system under study have been developed and implemented.
The research is an intensive study of one hospital.
The methods of investigation are those of interviewing and observation.

Hysterectomy, now the most common of all major operations in the UK, is currently performed on approximately one in five British women, and is even more frequent in the US and Australia.
There are large variations in the inter- and intra-national rates for this operation, which cannot be explained adequately by differences in morbidity, and there is at present little professional consensus on the appropriate indications for hysterectomy.
Attempts to isolate the determinants of the wide variations in rates for this largely ‘elective’ operation have focused on ‘supply’variables, such as clinical discretion, bed and theatre availability, manpower levels and factors affecting health service organisation, such as method of payment and waiting list times.
As yet, the role of consumer or patient ‘demand’, and the extent to which it may influence variations in surgical rates, has been relatively unexplored.
This study which builds on a previous study of social class variations in surgical rates, focuses on women suffering from menorrhagia (heavy bleeding)— a common indication for hysterectomy.
It includes interviews with GPs and patients to assess the extent to which patients exert an influence on the decision to opt for surgical treatment for this condition.

Everyday, people interact with one another and whether this is done informally or formally it involves a topic or string of topics.
Generally, one topic merges into another, and it may not be easily seen at the time that a change of topic has occurred.
This research is concerned with the special occasions when people specifically close a topic.
Preliminary investigation found that when a topic is closed two options for the ensuing course of the interaction may be relevant: making a definite move to close the whole conversation, or beginning a new topic by actively searching for something to keep the conversation going.
The project aims to find out why specifically closing a topic produces these two options.
In so doing it aims to uncover and examine the limited range of techniques used to close a topic.
It will then combine the resulting findings to examine how in using the various techniques the interaction can be directed into one of the options instead of the other.
Because topic is carried in talk, ordinary conversation will form the data.
It will be collected using tape-recorders, transcribed and analysed using a sequential and comparative method.

This project will form part of the ESRC's initiative on Social Change and Economic Life, which takes place in six varied localities.
Whereas research groups in each area are to conduct surveys of workers, the parallel survey of employers is to be conducted centrally for all the areas by the Policy Studies Institute, but in close collaboration with the local research groups.
The aim of the project is to obtain basic information about employers' policies and practices in the recruitment and management of the work-force, and in particular to establish how far such policies and practices have changed in recent years.
There will be a special emphasis upon the way in which firms have responded to new technology and to altered economic conditions.
The method to be used in the survey is telephone interviews.
Although relatively little used in social research until recently, telephone interviews have been adopted by the Policy Studies Institute in a series of large-scale studies of the diffusion of microprocessor technology.
A particular advantage of the telephone interview method is that it makes less demands on the time of managers than conventional ‘face-to-face’ interviews.

Informal social relationships personal relationships with kin, friends, neighbours, work colleagues and others play a central part in people's lives.
As sources of essential sociable interaction and ‘informal’ support and care, these networks are second in importance only to the nuclear family.
A number of British studies provide some evidence about such relationships or about their contribution to care, but this material remains unco-ordinated.
There is therefore no comprehensive picture of the regularities and variations in behaviour and, more important, little by way of explanation for them.
As a first step in closing this gap, the study brings together into coherent order existing data on informal relationships in Britain, and thus provides a context for future research.
The immediate aims are to develop theoretical understanding, suggest research priorities and contribute to thinking about relevant public policies.
Such policies include not only those on social care, where the contribution of informal networks is most obvious, but also on such matters as town planning and housing management, where the implications of sustaining existing networks or encouraging new ones may still not be sufficiently acknowledged.

This project examines the role played by communication in aspects of crowd behaviour, in particular its effect on potential disorder.
This involves consideration of how crowds come to be formed, the way a crowd communicates within itself and to others outside, the process by which the fact and nature of a crowd's existence is conveyed to other members of the community.
A special interest is in ‘flashpoints’: small scale incidents which may trigger off reactions from those not immediately involved.
The study is being conducted on past, present and future incidents involving crowds in and around Sheffield.
Existing evidence and theories are being used from a number of social science disciplines, especially psychology, socioial science disciplines, especially psychology, sociology and linguistics.
The main data are being collected through the observation of incidents, interviews with participants, bystanders and the general public and analysis of media coverage.

The issue of professional regulation in medicine has long been a matter of both public and academic interest.
Whilst there has been considerable theoretical work in the area, there has been little empirical study of either state, or colleague control of professional practice.
This research explores one area of regulation involving lay and professional people: the medical service committees which deal with complaints against GPs.
The method of investigation used is a content analysis of cases coming before one committee which covers a discrete geographical area.
The cases extend over a period of ten years.
The steps taken are
(1)
to categorise and to analyse the types of complaint;
(2)
to consider doctors' defences and how these relate to broader professional defences;
(3)
to examine the terms of reference of complaints committees and how and what judgements are made in specific instances.
These judgements define what is taken as acceptable or unacceptable professional behaviour.
The research should contribute not only to knowledge about the degree and type of control over this area of professional practice but also provide information on aspects of general medical services which have given cause for complaint.

This is primarily a study of how news judgements are made.
The aim is to document evidence on the way journalists make their daily decisions on what is news, on the events to which to give prominence, and on the treatment and presentation of those events.
A significant part of the project is the interviewing of journalists about their work.
This is being undertaken mainly in London but also partly in non-metropolitan centres and in Scotland.
The study includes an analysis of the content of newspapers and news broadcasts in one or more representative weeks and a more intensive inquiry into coverage of two major events.
It considers the continuity and self-perpetuation of perceptions among journalists, the effects of stereotyping, the extent of public reaction, and relations between journalists and managements.

The research consists of two inter-linked projects on Employment and Ageing, which are based on the re-analysis of two large Government data sets: the General Household Survey and the Labour Force Survey.
Project 1: The employment experience of the older worker A growing proportion of the population are in a transitory stage between paid employment and old age.
The study provides a nationally representative picture of the employment situation of men and women aged over 50, from 1980 to 1984.
Employment status (subdivided into full-time and part-time work, unemployment, permanent sickness and retirement) are related to leisure activities, health status, income and life-style.
In addition, the occupational characteristics and family circumstances of those remaining in employment beyond statutory retirement age are explored.
Project 2: The impact of elderly relatives in the household.
Using a nationally representative sample, this study examines the effects on family life of elderly persons in the household.
The employment status, income, lifestyle and leisure activities of household members are related to the level of physical disability of elderly persons in the household through an analysis of the General Household Survey for 1980.

The General Household Survey is a national representative continuous survey of UK households and their members carried out by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS).
Although it contains much information that is very valuable for academic research on a wide variety of topics (the family, poverty, the elderly, housing conditions and so on) in the form in which OPCS release it, the data are not easy for university researchers to use.
Members of the Stratification and Employment Group at the University of Surrey have previously received grants from the ESRC to pay for the preparation of more accessible versions of the General Household Survey data tapes from the annual surveys of 1973 and 1980.
This further project allows the investigator to continue the series with 1981 to 1982's data.
The processed tapes will be deposited with the ESRC Data Archive from where social scientists may obtain copies for their own research

The research is concerned with social aspects of the work of professional and occupational personnel, including general practitioners, health visitors and social workers engaged in primary health care.
In particular, the focus of the investigation is with the communication, both verbal and non-verbal, which occurs within the consultation between the professional and his client and that takes place on other occasions between the personnel themselves.
The data for the project are videotape recordings of actual day to day activities conducted within the medical organisation — consultations, clinics, team meetings, case conferences and the like.
The methodological techniques are drawn from recent developments in sociology, namely ethnomethodology and sequential analysis.

The 1983/4 Time Budget Survey — the first national time use survey to be sponsored by the ESRC — has already proved to be a rich source of information and has yielded fruitful insights in a wide variety of areas, ranging from the division of labour in the home to the activities of unemployed and elderly people.
(For a brief overview of the survey design and some of these results, see J I Gershuny, I D Miles et al, ‘Time Budgets: Preliminary Analyses of a National Survey’, in The Quarterly Journal of Social Affairs, Vol 2, No 1, 1986).
In the course of the creation of the data file by the survey organisation — a very complex process — a computer error led to the omission of a significant amount of information.
The preliminary analyses of the survey were completed just after the discovery of the error and before corrections could be made.
They were therefore based on a reduced number of cases (about two thirds of the ultimate total) and consequently could provide only tentative results.
This small project was provided to enable the investigators to incorporate the revised data into their working files, validate their preliminary results and prepare the complete data set for inclusion in an archive of comparable British time budget surveys from 1961-1984, which is to be made available to the social science community.
The work has now made possible some extremely interesting analyses of changes in time use over the last twenty-five years.
The great majority of the trends identified in the original reports — particularly the rise in men's domestic work and the steeper rise in the amount of time women are spending in formal work — were confirmed.
A subset of the data is now being incorporated into a multinational comparative data set being compiled by Professor Gershuny at the University of Bath, which for the first time enables comparisons of trends in time use, for similar social groups, across time and across countries.
This archive will make a significant contribution to a number of debates in social science which have so far lacked appropriate data.

The middle years are a time when physical and mental health may decline.
On the one hand mortality and morbidity begin to show marked rises, often as a result of ‘premature’ illness and disease.
And, on the other hand, this stage in the life-cycle can represent a crisis point for men and women as changes occur to physiology, life-style and life chances.
The purpose of the present investigation is to look at the influence of psychosocial factors on these patterns of health in the middle years.
The psychosocial factors to be considered include inter-personal and social contacts and relationships, leisure activities, quality of life, stressful life events, conditions at work, unemployment and so on.
Evidence is drawn from research and literature to consider the following three questions (although the focus is in the main on the second of these):
— the relationship between psychosocial factors in the early years (ie infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood) and health in the middle years.

The purpose of the research is to extend the scope of the research on Migration Response to Redundancy in Steel, Local Networks and Domestic Organisation (funded 1980).
The original research was designed to investigate the subsequent labour-market behaviour of a sample of steelworkers made redundant from the British Steel Corporation, Port Talbot, South Wales, and to relate this behaviour to the type of domestic organisation of their households and the character of their local social networks.
This research is designed to examine the effects of high levels of unemployment in Port Talbot (in part the result of the redundancies) on the social structure of that settlement.
It involves on the one hand an examination of the changing local demand for labour, and on the other an examination of the effects of unemployment on, and the response of, local voluntary associations.
These elements of local structure are conceived not only as important in their own right but as elements which serve to articulate the sets of social relationships in which the inhabitants participate so that these relationships constitute a field or network.
Such a local social network, its structure and degree of connectedness, is conceived to be of importance in determining the character and level of exchanges between inhabitants involving information, material support, and exchange of services.
The exchanges in turn affect labour-market behaviour, opinion formation, collective action and the level of informal ‘community’ support for the unemployed which together constitute the local social response to high levels of unemployment.

This research explores the effects of economic recession and changes in management practices, particularly during the last decade, on Bournville and Northfield.
These closely-linked suburbs are dominated by BL (at Longbridge) and Cadbury-Schweppes.
The traditional view is that labour relations at the two companies have been very different, Longbridge having materialistic ‘affluent workers’, Cadburys being run by ‘paternalistic’ employers.
However, despite these differences, both firms have drawn to a significant extent on the same pool of local labour, often on the same families.
The project explores how recent changes at the two firms — including widespread job losses and the introduction of new Japanese-style management techniques — have affected the local community.
Also whether the particular character of that community affected the ways in which job losses and new management styles have been implemented?
Other questions are raised such as: what are the implications of recent changes for government planning strategies?
Are patterns of political loyalty changing in Southwest Birmingham?
How are relations within the family being affected?
In order to find answers to these questions, the researchers are interviewing employees and ex-employees of the two firms and their families.
They are also talking to managers, union officials, local government officers, estate agents and similar people whose views and knowledge are relevant.
Historical material is also being examined in order to get a long term perspective on the more recent changes.

Accelerating economic and social change has left parts of the country hit hard by recession while elsewhere new patterns of prosperity are starting to emerge.
Swindon is an example of rapid growth and economic change, from rail town through manufacturing boom to services and advanced technology.
This has had major impacts on occupational structure and the social make up of the town, on lifestyles, culture and politics.
Moreover, the local council has been heavily implicated in these processes, initiating and shaping the town's development.
A key objective of the study is to link together economic, social and political change in the locality and situate this in the broader, national patterns of change.
The methodology draws on a combination of statistical sources plus an intensive programme of interviews and information gathering in the locality itself, the latter focusing on both employers and households.
This work complements the questionnaire-based study of ‘Social Change and Economic Life’ in Swindon.
This project was part of the Committee Research Programme on the Changing Urban and Regional System in the UK (award reference D042)

This project will continue earlier work on recruitment and selection to vacancies in retail sales and clerical occupations, in two locations in the North-East of England, which has been funded by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The projects' objectives are to provide an account of the social processes by which labour demands are generated, jobs formulated, personnel specifications developed and employees recruited and selected, and thus to increase our understanding of the ways in which people and jobs are matched in the labour market.
Surveys will be made of recruitment to four manual occupations (skilled and semi-skilled), using the methodology developed in the earlier study of non-manual occupations: selection of samples of specific job vacancies and interviewing the relevant recruitment decision makers, shortly after the vacancy has been filled, to question them about the whole process of recruitment from identification of a vacancy to selecting and appointing a new employee.
In conjunction with the analysis of the information obtained through these surveys, the data obtained in the earlier study will also be reanalysed to consider other aspects of the process of recruitment than the issue of gender discrimination which was the principal focus of that project.
In a subsequent stage of the project, detailed case studies of a small number of organisations will be undertaken in order to explore recruitment practices in greater depth and to consider their relationship to other aspects of the organisations' structure, operation and management.
These case studies, probably in six employing organisations, will be based on documentary sources and in-depth interviews with participants in the recruitment process.

The project arises out of the 1984 Montgomery Report's recommendation for research into the viability of the Gaelic language and the institutional framework of public policy-making affecting prospects for its maintenance.
Some stabilisation of Gaelic has occurred since 1961 and the project, following previous pilot studies, aims to indicate the factors promoting this and to assess the strength of factors working against language-maintenance.
Representative questionnaire surveys will be undertaken of attitudes and patterns of language-use in relationships to social roles and identities, geographical and demographic locations of Gaelic speakers in the principal Gaelic communities, areas where Gaelic has recently weakened, and amongst Gaelic speakers who have moved elsewhere for economic reasons.
Studies of key leadership and occupational roles and Gaelic-related institutions will be undertaken, as will a national opinion survey exploring general public attitudes towards Gaelic in Scottish life and institutions.
The surveys will enable a more detailed explanatory model of the speech-community to be achieved than has previously been possible, with relevant linkages to social and economic factors, population structure and trends, and key public institutions such as the media, education and administration.
Conclusions regarding conditions promoting minority language-maintenance or extinction will be applied to public policy-making.

What has been the effect on Thanet's traditional holiday trade of developments in the tourist industry internationally, such as the rise of package holidays overseas?
Has employment in new fields been sufficient to replace jobs lost in tourism?
These and other questions, including the effects on employment of restructuring of public services such as health or education in the area, are the subject of this research project.
Economic restructuring refers to such processes as mergers, rationalisations, the introduction of new types of work organisation, and new job definitions.
Often it is a response to increasing international competition and may take the form of closure of branches of multinational corporations.
As a whole the aim of the seven projects within this research development is to investigate how industrial restructuring is affecting different localities, their labour markets and political processes.
Most previous research on economic restructuring has focused on job loss and geographical shifts in investment in manufacturing industry, but manufacturing accounts for only 26% of all employment today and the Thanet area provides an opportunity to examine restructuring processes in an area dominated by the services sector.

Contemporary Brazilian agriculture raises key policy making issues.
Under twenty years of military rule, its output has grown to make Brazil the world's largest agricultural exporter after the United States.
Yet its production of basic foodstuffs for local consumption is still insufficient; and rural poverty, under-employment and out-migration intensify acute urban problems.
Under the newly civilian government, policy making objectives are changing.
A large agrarian reform and related regional development programmes are designed to reincorporate the low income rural population as producers, consumers and participants in a more democratic social system.
The success of such programmes depends heavily on how much part their recipients have in their design and execution.
The purpose of this research project is to monitor this, from the bottom upwards.
Using anthropological techniques of local participant observation, it will take particular account, through a series of integrated case studies, of regional variations of agrarian experience and resources.
Special importance is attached to producing results accessible and of practical value to those whose lives are being studied.

People's political views and their outlook on society are undoubtedly connected with their everyday personal situations, past and present, not least with their varying life experiences in economic terms.
But these connections are complex and as yet imperfectly mapped and understood; and they show signs of recent change — a new ‘volatility’ of political moods, for example.
This study will, first, explore the views held on a wide range of political and economic issues by a representative sample of 1500 adults in Sheffield — a city which, as a Labour stronghold hard-hit by recession, can serve as a ‘test case’ for research on this subject.
Interviews will concern also respondents' expectations for themselves, of society and social change, and will pay special attention to ambiguities of opinion suggested by earlier evidence.
Second, the study will collect detailed information about informants' economic life experiences and their own perceptions of those experiences — in paid work and out of it; with regard to housing and use of public and private welfare provision; in respect of household finance and domestic ‘divisions of labour’.
Third, the study will try to trace connections between these two areas of enquiry, to examine influences of personal economic experience on socio-political orientations.
In the event, interview length required reduction of the sample achieved to 1000.

The General Medical Council is a main instrument of professional self-regulation, maintaining the Register of qualified medical practitioners, overseeing basic medical education and co-ordinating continuing medical education.
The objective of the research is an analysis of the tensions which arise between the duty of the Council to protect the public and its simultaneous need to maintain the unity and confidence of the profession.
The research will seek to show how the Council, originally set up in mid-nineteenth century when medical practice was greatly different from today, has responded to the changed circumstances.
The research will illuminate current debates about the control and accountability of the profession and be relevant to current policy decisions.
The period under review is 1975-84 when the investigator was a lay member of the Council; a critical period, it includes the Merrison Report, the subsequent Medical Act and reform of the Council, as well as the implementation of EEC directions.
Methods of analysis include examination of Council documents,(excluding personal records), medical and lay press, interviews with key people.
Analysis will aim to cover issues of discipline, medical competence, clinical autonomy, educational standards, the representatives of the Council.

The Aberdeen study is primarily concerned with the social and economic impacts of the North Sea oil industry on the Aberdeen local labour-market area.
Over the past fifteen years, Aberdeen has experienced a major re-structuring of its economy.
Significant economic growth and social change has been brought about as a result of the offshore oil and gas industry.
A local study, Aberdeen and dualism, integrates data from core and local surveys.
This study examines the relationships between different sectors of the local economy, especially the nature and permeability of sector boundaries.
The experience of Aberdeen ‘locals’ throughout the period of oil development is examined by re-interviewing a sample of parents and children originally surveyed in 1964.
Occupational, family and residential histories over a twenty-year period will elucidate and Aberdonians' relationship to and experience of the oil industry across generations.
Another study examines the scale of in-migration, the social location and characteristics of in-migrants, employment/occupational histories and the domestic organisation of households and their relationship to the local community.
An additional study looks at the scale and organisation of multiple-earning households.

The agricultural industry is in many ways exceptional: not least because of its relative freedom from formal controls.
In the dairy sector, ‘exceptionalism’ was generated though an achieved balance between self-regulation and external legal regulation which conferred considerable autonomy on the farming community through the operation of the Milk Marketing Board.
By focusing on the tensions caused by the imposition in April 1984 of milk quotas the study will document an instance of ‘agricultural exceptionalism’ under stress.
In addition to extensive documentary research a range of interviews will be conducted with Milk Marketing Board and Dairy Trade Federation members; Ministry of Agriculture, National Farmers' Union, Country Landowners' Association and Farmers' Union of Wales staff and County Councils, such as Dyfed, in areas particularly affected by the imposition of quotas.
The competing claims of ‘voluntary co-operation’ and ‘legal regulation’as policy options in agriculture and countryside matters generally are currently of great concern and the study will consider the implications of recent developments in the dairy sector for other areas of agricultural policy such as land use and conservation.

What is happening to people's involvement in work?
A few years ago many thought the work ethic was being abandoned.
Some observers claim new patterns of involvement are rising in the economic recession.
Maybe a more urgent question is how households are reorganising their economic activities as old industrial structures are modified by long-term change.
Commitment to employment to having a job is not the same as commitment to work to effort or activity.
In an economy where manufacturing accounts for less and less employment, ‘post-industrial’ values might be raising people's hopes for fulfilling work.
What seems probable is that the forms of work involvement, and the way households arrange amongst themselves how they will provide for their needs, will evolve rapidly.
The effects of skill upon work commitment are also examined.
Swindon — a growing town with both contracting heavy industry and a growing number of high technology firms is a good place to start answering these questions, in core studies forming part of the Economic Life initiative.
A later related study will deal with the more specialised question of how involvement in unionism may be changing in sunrise firms, and how employee relations have been affected by different management strategies.

Maintaining a healthy body of scientific research in a period of financial stringency is a problem of widespread concern.
One worry is that innovatory but high risk research might be disproportionately affected by increased competition in the peer review process, since conservative decisions are more likely to prevail when resources are scarce.
The aim of the project is to analyse the effects of changes in the funding climate on innovatory research topics.
The effect of the financial changes on the sources of funds, the level and kind of research activity, and the peer review process within the funding agencies will be examined.
The project involves a close study of the scientific context of research proposals together with the interactions of researchers, reviewers and funding agencies — topics which have not so far been systematically examined.
The main methods of investigation are detailed interviews, documentary analysis and, above all, observation of the work of funding committees in action.

There has recently been a sharp rise of interest in artificial intelligence — very broadly the attempt to write computer programs to work at a human level of intelligence and performance in such tasks as identifying and recognising objects in cluttered environments, understanding ordinary human languages such as English, or diagnosing what is wrong in cases of human illness or machine failure.
In particular, there has been great interest in the practical commercial use of artificial intelligence, with many companies and even governments becoming involved.
Many science policy issues are raised by these developments.
To what extent are research results in fact ready for practical application?
How may appropriate results be identified?
How does basic scientific research fare in the face of so much application interest?
Is it threatened, or do sufficient financial and manpower resources become available to carry on the thrust of research?
Does the training of new people suffer?
Are enough people being trained in the appropriate areas?
What happens when people move from research to industry and commerce?
This project aims to investigate such questions, making use of various theories of how scientific knowledge is produced and transmitted, and various methods of identifying research activity and the parts played by different individuals and groups.
This should provide a basis for suggesting how best to manage the transfer of knowledge and personnel from research to commercial exploitation while ensuring the health of scientific research is maintained and promoted.

It is well known that despite substantial industrial and occupational changes, the degree of gender segregation in employment is still substantial, it is strongly associated with inequality and it restricts women's career opportunities.
This study is part of a collaborative project with Rosemary Crompton of the University of East Anglia.
It aims to investigate the cause and effects of gender segregation, with special reference to the career patterns of men and women, in a number of industry and occupational case studies.
This part of the project will focus on computer services and retailing, and will consist of interviews with key informants in relevant companies in East Anglia, as well as documentary analysis of national level data.
In addition an analysis of work history data collected from 1,000 informants in six localities, provided by the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative is to be carried out in collaboration with Duncan Gallie.
The focus of this part of the project is to examine the impact of employment segregation on career differentiation amongst men and women.

The aim of this project is to use life histories to study the ordinary experience of ageing.
Life stories have not been previously used in this way partly because sociologists have been more concerned with problems of deprivation, and oral historians with recapturing the experience of childhood and early adulthood in previous periods.
The project is designed to collect both old people's memories of their own parents in later age and their own experience.
The information gained on each generation will be from a different perspective, but will be in each case of intrinsic value in contributing to our understanding of the changing patterns and experience of ageing in the ordinary population.
The study will be based on 213 life history interviews with up to three generations of 100 families selected on the basis of a national random sample.
The interviews will be semi-structured and will cover: occupational histories, housing, life styles, kin and neighbour relationships, leisure, the transmission to the next generation, and the social and health needs of the elderly.
Differences in gender experience, as well as class background, will be explored in each aspect of inquiry.
Data was also analysed from 148 autobiographies of men and women born between 1830 and 1869, and 444 oral history interviews from the SSRC-funded project on ‘Family Life and Work Experience before 1918’.

This project investigates three aspects of contemporary social and economic change.
A study of 300 firms in Rochdale will examine the role of employers in the development of changing patterns of work in the town.
This will be supplemented by a series of intensive studies of technical change and the division of labour since 1979 which will form part of a wider international project into these issues.
The team will collect information on work and life histories of 1,000 inhabitants in Rochdale which will be utilized to examine a series of hypotheses about the causes and direction of current changes in the behaviour and attitudes of people living in Rochdale.
300 households will be examined in further detail to ascertain the relationship between household structure and labour market participation in the recent past.
This will be supplemented by an intensive study of 40 households, half of which will include at least one unemployed adult worker, in an attempt to ascertain the cultural significance of the broad social and economic developments that will be uncovered in the previous sections of the research.

This project concerns the impact of and responses to the coal dispute of 1984/85.
In particular the project is seeking to understand the role and action of women in mining households and the collective support organised by them in coalfield communities during the dispute.
This will lead to an exploration of the household division of labour and how far the effects of the year long strike generated enduring changes in the lives of men and women and their views about society and the community.
The research draws on previous work carried out in the coalfields which described the existence of a sharp division of labour between men and women.
The researchers think this is better understood by analysing the organisation of paid and unpaid work, in economic production and social reproduction.
While men and women contribute to both these spheres, the former is primarily men's domain and the latter primarily that of the women.
The project is examining the contention that a labour dispute imposes the need for alternative strategies in social reproduction, and that the support activities of women must primarily be seen in this light.
The effects on health, household budgets, attitudes to the media and political participation constitute part of the analysis.

The patterns of employment in Britain are being re-structured by employers seeking to maintain their market position during the current recession, and introduce new technology.
The divisions of labour at work are being re-negotiated between unions and management, men and women, and people of different wages.
The divisions of labour in the household are being re-negotiated between men and women and, adults and children such that the amount of time available to household members to spend on leisure and social activities is changing.
This research is based in Rochdale and has five main sections.
The first is a survey of employers, which analyses the structure of Rochdale employers according to industry, establishment size, industrial relations policies, the introduction of technical change and so on.
The second section is a survey of the work attitudes and work histories of 1,000 people, focusing on the themes of occupational change, technical change, attitudes toward features of the local labour market, and the relationship between household activities, labour market strategies and leisure patterns.
The third section is a survey of 300 households, focusing on the relations between employment strategies and conceptions of work, and a range of household specific patterns of gender relations.
The fourth section is an intensive study of work histories, focusing on the ways in which people connect the activities of paid and unpaid work and leisure.
The fifth is a work ethnography of Rochdale, focussing on an ethnographic explication of themes such as fragmentation and externalisation of elements of the labour process, casualisation of labour, and the complex ways in which households manage the different forms of work its members engage in.
This research is in collaboration with Lancaster University.

There is a growing recognition that an effective response to crime and crime prevention must reach beyond the conventional boundaries of the criminal justice system, and there have already been a number of practical initiatives which either attempt to draw upon the wider resources of the community, or which rely upon what is usually known at the ‘inter-agency’ or ‘multi-agency’approach.
Even so, this is still largely an unmapped terrain, and the research strategy adopted here is one which aims to clarify some of the issues involved in inter-agency work and to identify areas of work in which it might be usefully advanced together with the limits and obstacles to its development.
The research will focus on three key agencies whose work brings them into direct contact both with offenders and the victims of crime: the police service, probation service and social services departments.
It will be based in two contrasting urban regions, in that it seems reasonable to expect wide local and regional variations in established working practices and in the pattern of inter-agency linkages.
A further element of contrast built into the research is that it will explore how inter-agency policies are negotiated and enacted at a local level, in a small number of tightly defined neighbourhoods which will be chosen in such a way as to reflect demographic variations, differences in housing stock and employment, varying local crime rates, ethnic diversity, and other relevant factors.
In terms of outcomes, it is anticipated that the research will be of direct practical relevance to work in a variety of context such as neighbourhood policing schemes, juvenile liaison and diversion schemes, reparation and victim-support projects, multi-agency work on drug problems, neighbourhood watch projects, etc.

The Social Work Research Centre was established in the Sociology Department at the University of Stirling on the initiative of two bodies, the Economic and Social Research Council and the Social Work Services Group of the Scottish Education Department.
The Centre is designed to be a focus for social work research in Scotland.
The Social Work Services Group and the ESRC will each contribute £50,000 a year at current prices towards the costs of the Centre, which consists of a Director and three or four full-time researchers.
The intention is to fund the Centre for a period of eight years, subject to a detailed review in the fourth year.
Professor Juliet Cheetham took up the Directorship in January, 1986.
The object of establishing the Centre is the development of research which can be used to measure and evaluate the functions of social work, which is one of the major areas of local government activity in Scotland.
Regional Councils currently spend more than £300 million a year on Social Work Services, or some 10% of their total expenditure.
There is also a major involvement by central government and voluntary bodies.
Information on the effects of social work is frequently not systematically collected; where a programme of research studies has been conducted over the past decade, it has often proved difficult to develop a co-ordinated body of knowledge which can be applied to future work.
The continuing Research Centre will play an important part in filling the gap.
The work of the Centre will be aimed specifically at developing ways of establishing and measuring outcomes with the aim of clarifying the results of particular policies and practices.
Great importance will be attached to disseminating the results of the Centre's work, with emphasis on their implications for practice and policy development.
As the Centre develops it is hoped that the staff of social work agencies will undertake research projects in conjunction with it.
By establishing the Centre in an academic institution it will be possible for it to benefit from the other resources of the University and at the same time enable the knowledge gained from the research to be linked directly to social work training.
Research into the effectiveness of social work intervention is crucial for the development of good quality services.
It is also extremely difficult and can be contentious.
Given constraints on resources, research plans will have to take account of existing or relatively easily gathered data about services and consumers and the evaluative studies being conducted elsewhere.
Decisions about the Centre's research priorities must therefore be based on proper understanding of Social Work Departments and voluntary agencies, responsibilities, activities, resources, plans and problems.
During the early part of 1986 the Director will visit all Social Work Departments and major voluntary agencies in Scotland, academic institutions and other research centres.
A Senior Research Fellow will be appointed in the Spring of 1986.
Later in the year proposals for specific research projects and the Centre's overall programme for the first three years will be drawn up.

Much criticism has recently been made of the performance of routine police patrol.
The variety of comment illustrates that it is not possible for outsiders to specify criteria of competent practice without indulging in prescriptive evaluation.
Adding another prescriptive definition of ‘competence’ to those of politicians, informed citizens and former Chief Constables is unlikely to advance debate, affect policy or change police practice.
Police are understandably resistant to advice on how they ought to do their job from those without experience of it.
If ‘competence’ is to be usefully specified it must initially be in terms current amongst police.
The research will describe various styles of policing by careful attention to police/public interaction and will identify the criteria constables apply when attributing ‘competence’ to police conduct in events on patrol.
The criteria will be drawn on to support realistic models of styles of policing/public interaction in training.
A community policing style can be identified by distinctive uses of discretion, and the way police and citizens negotiate to achieve routine social control without civil disturbance will be a particular focus of fieldwork.
Field observations and interviews are the main methods, and these will take place in several divisions to enable comparison.

The Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) is responsible for science policy because of its role as a principal source of advice to the Secretary of State on the allocation of the DES science budget.
The ABRC is now spending £100,000 a year on studies to support its own activities.
Evidence of an increasing interest in science policy is also being shown in a growing concern with research evaluation in the Research Councils themselves and in the founding of a Policy Studies Unit within the Royal Society.

During the 1960's there were several studies which examined whether or not prisons rehabilitated prisoners through processes of ‘treatment’ or ‘training’.
Since then, prison service has become more anxious about questions of security and control, and confidence in the rehabilitative ideal has declined.
In its place has grown a concern to develop and sustain humane standards of custody: what Winston Churchill once described as ‘one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country’.
This comparative study of five representative prisons for adult males in one region of the prison system, seeks to provide benchmarks for the 1980's as to how far humane containment is achieved in the context of maintaining security and control.
On the basis of interviews with samples of prisoners and staff, and of observations, an attempt is made to show: what the prison system is like; why it is like it is; whether it makes sense to those who experience it; and whether there are alternative ways of reconciling security and control with humane containment.
Some comparisons are made with examples of best practices in the United States, using data from an earlier ESRC study carried out by the researcher.

The period since the end of the Second World War has seen a substantial increase in the proportion of married women engaged in paid work.
This increase has been associated with a decline in the proportion of life which women spend in bearing and rearing children which has resulted in there being a significant period in women's later lives in which they lack any major domestic occupation.
The research is designed
(i)
to explore the factors which determine women's decisions to adopt employment as a major life activity after their loss of any major domestic occupation;
(ii)
to examine the effects of the decision to engage in paid work, or to abstain from it, on their social situation immediately prior to retirement;
(iii)
to examine the way the determinants of employment decisions have changed over time.
The study is a small-scale exploratory study which will involve intensive interviews with 54 married women whose children are old enough not to require that degree of care and attention which makes it difficult for a married woman to take up full-time employment.
The sample will be made up of two subsamples: those working full and part time and those not in employment.
Each subsample will include women whose children have just reached this stage, women approaching statutory retirement age and women half way between these two points in their lives.
Women who have maintained and/or developed an extensive network of personal relationships in middle age are held to be most favourably placed in coping with the problems of old age.
The research will explore the way in which paid work in later life facilitates or inhibits the development of such networks.

The Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at the University of Warwick was formed as an ESRC Designated Research Centre (DRC) on 1st October 1984.
It carries forward the work of the former ESRC Research Unit on Ethnic Relations at the University of Aston in Birmingham: that Research Unit is now closed.
A new programme of work in this field has been prepared by the Centre Directors which officially commenced on 1 April 1985.
The Centre's research is organised on a team and cross-team basis to ensure high levels of integration in the design and operational stages of the research project.
The following entry relates to the research teams now in place.
Education and ethnicity team

This is an integrated programme of research which seeks to investigate the development and implementation of multicultural/antiracist education in different Local Education Authorities and their schools.
(a)
Antiracist education policies in two community colleges in the Midlands
Investigator: B Troyna
This is a study to observe, analyse and record the formulation of school-based antiracist policies in two different research settings.
One is a college in a white middle-class suburb; the other is an inner-city, ethnically heterogeneous college.
(b)
Antiracist education policies in Manchester and Sheffield
Investigator: Ms J Williams
This study will investigate how two local education authorities have shifted the emphasis of their multicultural policies towards antiracism.
(c)
Antiracist and multicultural education in school
Investigator: P Foster
This research commenced in September and is an ethnographic study of the day-to-day routines of an ethnically-mixed, inner-city school.
The researcher will also assume a consultancy role in helping teachers develop work along antiracist lines.

Over the last ten years there have been major changes in the employment structure of British society.
These involve occupational structure, changes in the gender composition of the workforce, increased unemployment, and increases in the use of casual employment.
The changes influence both the nature of working lives and the time spent outside work.
The principal emphasis of this research programme is to examine the attitudes of the population to these changes, with special reference to work, to look at the adaptation of the population to their changed employment environment, and to consider the impact of these changes on households, family and community relations.
Topics for research will include the following:
With regard to employer policies:
The nature of recruitment policies
Implications of technical change
Use of temporary and part time workers
Relations with trade unions
Implication of product market competition
With regard to work attitudes and experiences:
The Work Ethic
Work Aspirations and Experience
Attitudes to Technical Change
Attitudes to the Trade Unions
Attitudes to Job Mobility and Geographical Mobility
The Impact of Family Values and Relations on Attitudes to Employment
The Relationship between Paid and Unpaid Work
The Implications of Changes in Employment Opportunities for Decision Making Processes in the Household

Coventry is one of six localities selected for detailed study as part of the Social Change and Economic Life initiative.
Until the 1970s Coventry was one of the fastest growing cities in post-war Britain.
Almost two-thirds of its workforce was employed in manufacturing in 1971.
Seven out of ten of these employees worked for the seven largest employers, all but one of whom were in the motor vehicle, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering sectors.
The sharpness of Coventry's recession has been dramatic.
Over the period 1974-83, employment fell from 192,000 to 131,000, with the seven largest employers shedding over 40,000 employees in the same period.
Unemployment is now over 17% with the proportion of long-term unemployed particularly high.
Expansion in the service sector has been considerably smaller than the decline in manufacturing.
Such dependence on manufacturing makes Coventry a crucial locality in which to investigate employers' and communities' responses to industrial restructuring and recession, both on a comparative basis and as a study in itself.
Sample surveys of individuals, households and employers will be carried out in the locality on behalf of the ESRC by Public Attitude Surveys Ltd, and by the Policy Studies Institute.
In addition, detailed information about changing employment patterns will be gathered and case studies of employing establishments carried out by the named investigators.

The possibility of ‘practical utility’ is currently the most pervasive and persuasive justification available in industrial societies for the development of specific areas of knowledge.
Thus scientists in many fields tend to emphasise the practical pay-off of their research.
This study in the sociology of scientific knowledge investigates the ‘rhetoric of application’ surrounding the social science subdiscipline of health economics.
Following from a series of previous studies of knowledge producing communities, the research aims for detailed documentation and explanation of the variety of ways in which the ‘practical utility’ of health economics is portrayed and assessed.
The research focuses on the evident tension in health economics between the ‘pure’ and the ‘applied’, the ‘theoretical’and the ‘practical’, and the ‘correct’and the ‘useful’.
Comparisons of the differences in the arguments about the practical effectiveness of health economics are made
(a)
between producer and users,
(b)
between those in differing social locations and
(c)
between different funding circumstances.
The methods used include close observation of the health economics culture ‘from the inside’ together with extensive interviewing of various groups of health practitioners — the potential users — as well as health economists themselves.

The Social Affairs Committee of the Economic and Social Research Council decided in 1983 that a national time budget study would be relevant to its general policy aims.
The dataset obtained would provide a common database for the Committee research developments in Ageing, the Family, Social Change and Economic Life, and Inequalities in Health.
As a result of the Pilot Study, it was decided to proceed with a seven day diary rather than a one day diary, but that a methodological component should be built into the Survey to monitor the quality of the data.
A contract was then issued to Social and Community Planning Research to carry out the Time Budget Survey and to deposit the data in the ESRC Data Archive for general use.
The Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex were appointed as advisers to the project.
Data have been obtained from some 1,550 diary respondents and preliminary analyses reported in the committee's journal, The Quarterly Journal of Social Affairs, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp. 387-413.

Prior to the Sex Discrimination Act (1975), the Scottish Police Federation had voiced strong objections to employing women within the service on an equal basis with men.
In 1977, the Joint Central Committee was asked to examine the effects of the Act on the Police Service in Scotland and to make recommendations regarding the employment of female officers.
The JCC concluded that the implementation of the Sex Discrimination Act in the police service has proved unsatisfactory', outlining various areas of concern relating to the use of policewomen:
(a)
Danger to the policewoman in being asked to do duties for which she is physically unsuited;
(b)
Inability of the policewoman to provide the ‘deterrent presence’ often required of police during industrial disputes etc;
(c)
A loss of expertise in the areas of sexual assaults, child offences and missing persons--previously the province of policewomen.
The research investigates the effects of the Sex Discrimination Act on the working role of Scottish police officers, paying particular attention to those areas of concern highlighted by the JCC.
The investigation concentrates mainly on how the actual working role of officers has changed and examines any possible changes in attitude of police officers to the work or to each other due to the Sex Discrimination Act.
Also covered in the investigation are the Act's effects and implications for the recruitment and training of Scottish police officers.

In recent years it has been widely suggested that our prisons are in a ‘state of crisis’, a situation made worse by inadequate means for monitoring what the prisons are doing, and a lack of formal safeguards against bad practices.
Several prison reforms have now been introduced: an independent Prison Inspectorate, financial controls, and legal representation for prisoners at certain disciplinary hearings.
But fears are now being voiced that these new safeguards do not make a complete ‘package’ and that the failure of one to work properly might have a ‘domino effect’on the efficacy of others.
This study looks at four prison systems--England and Wales, France, West Germany and the Netherlands--each of which have different ‘packages’ of safeguards.
Its aim is to see whether safeguards such as standards for prison conditions, independent inspectorates, and independent tribunals in internal disciplinary hearings, make any difference to the ‘quality of life’ of inmates or to the good running of the prisons, and whether a failure in the effectiveness of any one safeguard has any consequences for the effectiveness of others.
The results of the study should enable prison managers, policy-makers and Parliament to monitor prisons more efficiently and to plan for prison reform more effectively.

In England and Wales, the Registrar General's social classes, which are derived from people's occupations, are used to look at the distribution of everything from the incidence of stillbirth to the distribution of owner occupation.
But from Prime Minister to school dinner lady, married women are routinely classified not according to the work they do themselves, but by the work which is done by their husbands.
A school cleaner married to a doctor is in Social Class I and a school cleaner married to a labourer is in Social Class V. A social classification system is one of the ways in which we can see how successful a society is in educating and sustaining the healthy life of its members.
We know, for instance, that a Social Class V woman (or rather a woman married to a Social Class V man) has less of a chance of having a healthy child who will reach adulthood than a woman who is married to a man in Social Class I.
There is much that is unsatisfactory in the current convention for allocating women to a social class, and this project, which uses the Longitudinal Study, a 1% sample of the census, aims to develop a social classification scheme for women in and out of paid work and based on full or part time paid work and domestic responsibilities.
The project will be carried out in the Social Statistics Research Unit of City University.

The extent to which patients and doctors understand each other varies.
Over very simple consultations there may be little confusion, but often the problem underlying a consultation is complex, combining physical and psychological aspects.
Some of the misunderstanding may result from very basic differences in the way doctors and patients think about such elementary things as’ the body’, ‘blood’, ‘cleanliness’and ‘feeling well’.
More specifically, patients may differ very greatly in their understanding of terms such as‘blood pressure’ or ‘chest pains’.
The aim of the study is to document and interpret conceptions of health and illness used by doctors and patients and to show how the way people think about their health affects the consultation with the doctor.
This study will concentrate on South Asian-ancestry patients where misunderstandings in the medical situation are often compounded by there being no shared language and little appreciation of differences in custom and outlook.
The investigator will talk at length to as many as 100 patients and a number of GPs.
The findings should provide the basis for proposals which could improve the GP-Patient consultation.

One of the main functions of the English and Scottish Law Commissions under the Law Commission's Act 1965 is ‘to take and keep under review all the law with which they are respectively concerned with a view to its systematic development and reform, including in particular the codification of such law…’
The object of the research is to assess the codification requirement from the standpoint of a comparative sociology of legal codification.
The research is in three main areas.
The first is the comparative sociological analysis of the codification of private law in Europe, paying attention to the contrasting experiences of Germany and France.
The second area is a comparison of the legal cultures of common law and codified legal systems with particular reference to the administration of justice and the institutions of legal interpretation and judgement.
The third area is a case study of an instance of legal codification in the UK.
This is the partial codification of contempt law in the Contempt of Court Act 1981 following the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (Sunday Times v UK 1979) that the common law of contempt violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The aim of the project is to produce a unified coding scheme for occupations with the following features:
(1)
Compatibility with the major existing schemes.
It is primarily organised along the lines of the current OPCS scheme, but it would also be possible to use it for coding to KOS or CODOT.
(2)
Use of the two main dictionaries of occupational titles available, the OPCS and CODOT.
(3)
Allowing for a level of coding somewhere between the highly specific and detailed CODOT scheme and that of OPCS, in which are sometimes to be found rather heterogeneous categories.
(4)
Being primarily computer-based, which allows for first, easy and rapid editing and updating; second, automatic sorting according to the purposes of the use; and third, automatic search procedures.
(5)
Incorporating a table look-up of existing aggregations such as the Registrar-General's Social Class and Socio-Economic Group (SEG) and Goldthorpe classes.
These follow straightforwardly from OUG and Employment Status, and the procedure is easily computerised.
(6)
Relating back to previous OPCS classifications, particularly the 1970 scheme, allowing for further table look-ups.

Small scale enterprise and self-employment are increasingly recognised as playing a major role in Britain's economy.
Obtaining reliable information about those who own and run small enterprises, however, is difficult because there are no satisfactory national data sets directly concerned with this economic grouping.
This project will secondary analyse the General Household Survey(GHS) for the years 1979-1984 to examine the sub-samples of owner-managers and the self-employed.
Data on social and biographical characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, education etc will be explored as well as on type of economic activity.
Because of the high quality and coverage of the GHS, the results will be equivalent to those from an approximation to a random sample of owner-managers and the self-employed covering the whole range of economic activities in which small scale enterprise is represented.
The findings will provide valuable information for other researchers conducting the more common smaller scale studies and for policy-makers.
A feasibility study completed earlier in 1986 demonstrated the viability of the project and the value of the information on the small enterprise owner and self-employed which can be obtained through such a procedure.

Research in the social sciences as a whole has so far done little to establish the relative strength of the effects of past and present on self-esteem.
There has, in fact, been a tendency to avoid the issue and view self-esteem as primarily an enduring trait.
However, in a time of social change in terms of increasing unemployment and changes in family structure, there is a need to investigate the development and stability of the self image in terms of the impact of social deprivation.
The inquiry follows from earlier longitudinal research begun in 1980 of working-class women with at least one child at home living in Islington, an inner city area of London where levels of social deprivation are high.
A strong association was found between low self-esteem and current adverse circumstances with both relating to an increased risk of developing clinical depression in the following year.
By interviewing a subsample of women from the original study it will be possible to plot the stability of self-esteem over a 7 to 8 year period and its relationship to changing social circumstances.
It will also be possible by interviewing teenage daughters of the women to make inter-generational comparisons as well as to consider the impact of adolescent experiences on the development of self-esteem.

This is a comparative study of three mining communities, selected for their comparability in terms of size, demographic structure and the importance of mining in the local economy, and for their contrasting involvement in the dispute (ie whether solidly pro-strike, anti-strike or ‘split’).
Specific topics being addressed are those which have been suggested as a possible legacy of the dispute, such as irreconcilable bitterness between former working and former striking miners and their families in a ‘split’ community; permanent disaffection from the police and from the institutions of legal and political authority as a whole as a result of experiences within striking communities; and changing family relationships as a result of the mobilization of women during the dispute.
It is expected that any such changes to be manifested not only at the attitudinal and cognitive levels, but also in behavioural indices such as higher rates of criminal activity, marital problems and disputes at work.
The theoretical framework of the research is interdisciplinary, drawing for example on sociological models of community, represented by such people as Bulmer, and the psychological notion of ‘social representations’ proposed by academics like Moscovici and Farr.
The principal methodologies being used are those of structured and unstructured interview with individuals and groups, and intended to carry out a questionnaire survey in each of our three communities.

The research uses nationally representative survey data to establish the relationship between the employment of one member of a household and the employment of other household members.
It is likely that this will vary with the income level of the household and with life-cycle stage.
By using longitudinal data, it is possible to establish, for example, the effect of job loss by one household member on the work patterns of others in the household.
The project will use a model which takes into account both external factors such as the level of unemployment, and also factors within the home, for example, the presence of young children.
In historical time, the household formed the unit of work and the division between paid work and domestic work was less clear than it is to-day.
Nonetheless, it is still important to understand the dynamics which operate within the household to influence whether or not a job is sought.
In particular, policies designed to further the employment prospects of women need to be informed by such an understanding.

Current socio-psychological discussions of school and gender have focused on the consequences of gender stereotyping for boys and girls.
Attention has been given to such topics as the marking of subjects for gender, the differential achievements of boys and girls, and the poor performance of secondary school girls in mathematics.
Relatively little attention has been given to the processes which result in these different outcomes, and almost none has been directed to gender in the primary school.
It is likely that gender differences in adolescence are, in part, the consequence of differential socialisation in earlier schooling.
In primary school, children are presented with a regime in which there are different expectations of how boys and girls should behave and perform.
This project will examine the process through which boys and girls adapt to this regime, and how they take on a particular social gender identity within the institution.
The project is methodologically innovative in that the first phase consists of an ethnographic study of gender in the primary school aimed at providing a description of the role which gender plays in the organisation of social life.
A series of individual observation and interview measures will be derived on the basis of this ethnography.
This procedure will ensure that the individual measures tap aspects of school life and children's activities which are significant for their gender development.
In the second phase the individual measures will be used to follow two classes of children through their first year of school, and a further two classes through their first term.
The results of this investigation should help to clarify some of the complex issues involved in the debate on gender and schooling.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in how the parents of young mentally handicapped children can foster and encourage their children's development.
This research project focuses on the communication skills of those young Down's syndrome children who show a profound delay in their language development.
It will investigate how such children do attempt to communicate, and the problems that this creates for parents.
And it will isolate the more effective techniques that parents have at their disposal for communicating with their children.
This will make it possible for more informed advice to be given to parents of mentally handicapped children about how they can best assist their children's language development.
The study follows on a pilot study in 1983-84 supported by the University of York.
The present research involves making extensive video recordings in the homes of eight carefully selected families and submitting them to various forms of analysis.

Recent research has demonstrated that people with severe mental handicaps can undertake productive work, with adequate support.
The study, carried out in conjunction with the local Downs Syndrome Association, will locate employers in the Grampian Region willing to ‘give it a try’.
The research will examine the feasibility for exploring the response of ‘normal’ people in the work force to opportunities for assisting and supporting their handicapped workmates and, perhaps, learning from them.
By this means some of the theories associated with the principle of ‘normalisation’ will be tested.
The implications include the self-image of the handicapped person, developing confidence and, indeed performance, and at the same time enhancing opportunities for changing the attitudes of others.
Compiling a directory of employers willing to employ Downs school leavers provides the framework for clarifying the feasibility and methods that can be used in a further, more substantial research contribution.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 extended police powers with accompanying safeguards.
One argument over the Act concerns the adequacy of the safeguards: civil libertarians maintain they are too weak while rank-and-file police lament the burden of paperwork and bureaucratic routine as an impediment to effective crime investigation.
The safeguards are primarily internal processes of police management, supervision and discipline.
Some observers see this as a deficiency: others maintain that effective control over use of police powers must necessarily involve day-to-day supervision.
The debate can only be resolved through empirical study of the new system in operation.
The pivotal safeguard in the Act is the new institution of custody officer.
This officer (usually a sergeant) is the overseer of the use of arrest and is responsible for the proper conduct of detention and interviewing of suspects.
The research is therefore central to evaluation of the Act and the approach to police accountability it embodies.
The study involves observational fieldwork in different types of police stations.
The focus is on the operational role of custody officers.
The observation is related to indices of operational impact including: the time suspects spend in detention: the proportions of prisoners seeking legal advice; charge and conviction rates; and complaints against the police.

The Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development report published in 1986 amply demonstrates the mounting concern which now exists throughout the British scientific community and those more directly involved in various aspects of the decision making processes relating to the future funding of scientific research in the UK.
It also reveals an escalating level of controversy which now surrounds the belief that strategic research should be based upon the notions of economic viability and military applicability.
This study surveys and analyses the understanding of science found among members of social and organisational groups likely to be involved in the process of identifying strategic research areas in science such as scientists, managers, civil servants etc.
It focuses on two distinct areas, one is the physical and one is the biological sciences, using a case study approach to explore differing organisational and economic constraints.
It therefore examines those issues which have contributed to the formation of wide ranging perceptions held by those actively involved in both the formation and implementation of scientific investigations in various related industries.
In doing so it seeks to address the motivations, the power structures and the social networks which operate both within and between these differing groups.
The primary emphasis will, however, be placed upon the aforementioned groups' perceptions/understanding of the ‘exclusive’ nature of scientific knowledge and its formation, the necessary resources vital to the pursuit of scientific discovery, the impact of science on society generally, and finally, the interaction between science and its applications in terms of technological innovation.

Generally, the approach in this initiative is based on the conviction that the primary and most basic interface between the individual and the social world is to be found in the day to day transactions he or she has with other individuals.
There are two particular respects in which the investigators contribute to the picture of young people's lives that emerge from this initiative.
The first is to provide a Scottish dimension to the study as a whole, allowing some assessment of the significance of historical, cultural and institutional differences, north and south of the border.
This project examines the relevance of Scottish identity, and the link between the geographical and the economic, political and social horizons of young people.
The investigators chose Kirkcaldy to examine the Scottish experience because it is a relatively self-contained labour market in which employment trends and industrial mix follow those of Scotland generally.
Within the district are towns which rest on contrasting industrial bases, including the receding strengths of the traditional industries such as shipbuilding and coalmining, and the ‘sunrise’ industries of micro-electronics and computing.
The second contribution is in the investigators' particular focus on the manner in which young people's social and personal environment influences their developing understanding of economic and political issues.
The investigators focus on the patterns of social relationships and resources that young people utilize in moving towards adult status and a position in the employment market.
The project explores the role of these social networks in reproducing social class positions in a new generation of adults while examining the degree to which the networks themselves are influenced by socio-economic forces.
The main emphasis is on the various ways that these relationships may pattern and establish expectations and opportunities for different individuals.
Young people's changing involvement in domestic, familial, and peer networks may be especially important areas of social participation which contribute to their beliefs concerning sex roles, political interest and involvement, leisure, and economic responsibility.
It is anticipated that the relationships between parents and their young sons and daughters will be modified according to changes in the balance of household contributions as the children move towards adult responsibilities.

Recent research in the sociology of technology has focused on the factors that determine crucial design choices: in the sociology of science, the role of instrumentation in shaping the development of science is being stressed.
This project combines these two interests.
Several teams of infrared astronomers are currently building cameras incorporating mosaic detector arrays.
These arrays, which combine the output of several hundred individual sensors, emerge from military R & D, and are now available on the open market.
But, despite this identical technical input, the teams' cameras will differ significantly.
The aim of this project is to investigate the reasons for these differences and their subsequent effects.
The way in which the teams organise their work will be one focus of analysis: another will be the teams' differing locations (in observatories or universities), and the extenbhich their designs are influenced, not only by ‘scientific goals’, but also by their perceptions of other important ‘reference groups’(eg other users, or committees considering the design of later facilities).
The project will draw on interviews and archival documents, with some participant observation.

The aim of the project is to establish a data-base of recent and continuing research on Women/Gender, by obtaining up-to-date records of research in progress in the universities, polytechnics, government departments, Quangos, etc.
Once the base is operational, it is hoped that its existence will facilitate contact between researchers in various institutions and disciplines, and help create a network between people who have a common interest in gender issues.
It is also expected that the existence of such a database will help the researcher to identify policy-relevant research and those areas which may be receiving insufficient attention.
To this end the researcher will ask specialists in the fields covered by the database to comment on the range and area of research on women and gender issues in order to establish a research agenda, and an assessment of the facilities needed for the next few years.

Working under the auspices of the Centre for Science Studies and Science Policy at Lancaster, Drs Brian Wynne, John Wakeford and Stephen Payne have linked up with the Child Care and Development Group at the University of Cambridge to carry out comparative study of public interpretations of scientific and technological concepts.
The study focuses on the processes by which people try to understand information from various sources about
(1)
the medical and environmental effects of radiation
(2)
innovations in obstetrics and
(3)
interactive information technology as used in the home or at work.
The interdisciplinary team is using approaches from anthropology, sociology, social psychology and cognitive science to understand the processes by which members of the lay public and others directly involved with some issue, such as the Chernobyl fallout, combine scientific information from ‘official’ sources with interpretations of their own experience into forms meaningful and useful to themselves in their own practical situations.
Rather than measure degrees of public (mis) understanding against some yardstick of ‘real’ scientific knowledge, it recognises that science and technology have and implicate a variety of publics, who, in using science at work, in managing their personal lives, or as consumers, will have different kinds of contacts with science, different levels of understanding of its language and ideas, and different conceptions of science and technology which will be related to other aspects of their lives.
What is often called public ‘(mis) understanding’ of scientific knowledge (eg about technological risks) thus may be more to do with public judgements about the credibility of the institutions which control that knowledge, or with the pragmatic translation of scientific information.
The project also explores the extent to which the scientists' (mis) understanding of ‘the’ public may be as much a problem as public (mis) understanding of science.
The part of the study which relates to innovations in obstetrics is being undertaken by Drs Frances Price and Martin Richards of the Child Care and Development Group at Cambridge.
Drs David Gorst at Lancaster Royal Infirmary, Jerry Ravetz, Honorary Reader in the Lancaster Centre for Science Studies and Science Policy and Iain Chalmers, Director of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford are acting as consultants to the research group.

This is a longitudinal study of approximately 1,600 young people who are representative of all Liverpool school-leavers.
The sample is from two cohorts, initially aged 15-16 and 17-18.
These young people will be surveyed by mailed questionnaire on three separate occasions over a two-year period, commencing in spring 1987.
Smaller sub-samples, totalling approximately 120, will be studied more intensively by home interviews and telephone contact.
The purpose of the research is to explore inter-connections between young people's careers through education and in the labour market, their family and peer relationships and leisure interests, and the development of their self-concepts and social beliefs and attitudes.
Liverpool is one of four areas where comparable studies are being launched.
The Liverpool inquiry will be examining the transition to adulthood within an area in long-term economic decline, where general unemployment is well-above the national average, and where youth unemployment has now reached chronic levels.

Previous research has pointed to a number of socio-demographic factors that contribute to the likelihood of a child coming into the care of local authorities.
These include illegitimacy, family breakdown and reconstitution, social class, unemployment, poverty, and ethnicity.
This project will provide an up-to-date study of the impact of such factors on the size and composition of the population of children in care and on the likelihood of children coming into care.
The research will examine trends and areal variation in the family circumstances of the child population and the demographic determinants of these.
Secondly, trends in various socio-demographic and economic variables will be compared with trends in the size and composition of the population of children in care in collaboration with those involved in a complementary programme of research at the University of Bristol.
Such factors as the growth in unemployment and numbers of one-parent families mean that a major aim will be to identify more specific indicators of a heightened risk of entering care.
Finally, the project will look at implications of current socio-demographic trends for children's family circumstances and the possible extent of demand for child care in the future.

The main aim of this study is to computerize the bibliometric (publication and citation) data collected in a previous ESRC-funded project on ‘CERN: Past Performance and Future Prospects’(HR 7448).
The existing data-base covers over 10,000 experimental high-energy physics papers produced worldwide in the 11 main international journals in the field over the period 1960-82 and the citations they received in the Science Citation Index up to 1982.
The rationale behind computerization is to enable secondary analysis of the data to be carried out by other social scientists, in particular by historians and sociologists of science.
A second aim of the study is to update the data-base to the end of 1984.
The full data-tapes will be deposited in the ESRC Data Archive.

At present, we know very little about what ordinary people feel or think about science.
The aim of this project is to remedy this situation by conducting a survey of a representative sample of approximately 2,000 people aged 18 and over living in private households in Great Britain.
The survey, which will be a fairly detailed document taking around 45 minutes to complete, will explore the complex inter-relationships between people's formal and informal experiences of, interests in, attitudes towards, and understanding of science.
(By science here, we mean all natural sciences and all science-based technologies, including much of modern medicine.)
The survey, which is being designed in the light of parallel work currently being undertaken by other ESRC-funded research projects on the public understanding of science, will measure a combination of background, psychological and social factors in relation to people's expressed levels of interest in, attitudes towards, and informedness about the world of science.
Particular objects of interest in the study will be people's understanding of the processes and the products of science, and people's views on controversial or ‘high-risk’ science.

This three-year project is being conducted at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), University of Sussex, under the direction of B R Martin.
The main aims of the project are:
(1)
the further development of input, output and performance indicators for scientific research, including updating, synthesizing and critically reappraising the results of previous work at SPRU;
(2)
an analysis of the relationship between inputs (funding, manpower) and outputs (eg publications, citations) and of the determinants of research performance; in particular, the research will examine the extent to which successful performance depends on the resources available as opposed to other factors (for example , institutional environment, organizational structure, etc), and how these various factors interact;
(3)
the development of improved links with other researchers (both those engaged in empirical research evaluation studies and those carrying out theoretical work on models of science and technology) and with science policy-makers (in order to ensure effective dissemination of research results from the study).

Subject Area:
Science policy and science studies; Research process
This project has two principal objectives.
The first is to offer a systematic analysis of the practical choices confronted by a group of scientists in the course of their work.
Previous studies have tended to concentrate almost exclusively on scientists' choices between different theories or explanations since such choices were regarded as the characteristic feature of science.
This study will also take into account choices between alternative methods and the selection of topics and sites for investigation.
These latter kinds of choice are particularly significant since they represent an area where scientists' decisions meet most directly with questions of concern to policy makers.
The second objective is to study cross-cultural differences in the development of research methods, nomenclature and research organisation between different national and geographical traditions.
The project will adopt a case-study methodology and will focus on scientific studies of the Precambrian.
This case is particularly well-suited to the purposes of the project since the complexity of the available scientific evidence and the global distribution of the rocks mean that practical decisions about what, where and how to study the Precambrian have not become routinised.
Hence the everyday, practical choices which must occur in all branches of science are rendered especially visible in this case.

New computer-based technologies are widely predicted to have fundamental implications for the role of engineering draughtsmen and engineering designers, and the relationship of the design activity to other organisational functions.
This research aims to investigate the implications of computer aided design technology for the nature of design work and the management of the design activity.
Of particular interest are changes in skill requirements, quality of work, work organisation and management control.
Specific attention is given to the manner in which engineers as an occupational group are able to influence the outcomes of the introduction of new technology at work-place level.
In addition the questions of whether computer technology leads to a division between technician and professional level engineers, and a greater integration of design with other organisational activities, is explored.

Subject Area:
Higher and further education
This project grew out of a previous ESRC funded study, ‘Participation in Higher Education’(HR 6846) and will build upon the findings of that study.
The project has six main areas of
(1)
the extent to which participation in higher education varies between the sexes and across social class and religious groups; for example, Have the numbers of working class Protestant youths in higher education increased enough to match the levels of participation of Catholics?
2) the extent to which Northern Irish institutions of higher education attract students as well qualified as those going ‘across the water’; Why do some courses in Britain attract better qualified students than those who do equivalent courses in Northern Ireland?
(3)
the trends, compared to the previous study, in the rates of migration out of the Province of highly qualified students; What sorts of students decide not to return to Northern Ireland, electing to take up employment elsewhere?
(4)
the ways in which the newly established University of Ulster (the first ‘polyversity’) has changed patterns of student study.
(5)
the experience of social mobility and employment of recent graduates; Do certain professions, such as medicine and law, tend to recruit students whose parents can be found in the same occupation?
(6)
the links between subjects studied, geographical location and earnings of graduates; Which graduates command the highest salaries and where?
The project will collect the information necessary for investigating the above areas by sending a postal questionnaire to all students who first received higher education grants in 1979 and in 1985.
In this way, both a complete cohort of students who have just begun their education will be covered.
This method was used in the previous study and was successful.
The project will be based in the Policy Research Institute (Northern Ireland), which is sponsored jointly by the two universities in Northern Ireland and by government.
As with the previous study it is anticipated that the project will generate findings that can be used by various government departments and other public bodies to address issues of policy.

This research is concerned with obligations between adult relatives (excluding spouses) to provide practical and material assistance for each other, especially: providing personal care; giving or lending money; offering a home on a temporary or permanent basis.
Current welfare policies are increasingly seeking to build upon responsibilities between family members.
This project compares assumptions incorporated into social policies about these obligations, with people's beliefs about them, and how such beliefs are put into practice.
Questions to be explored include: How large is the gap between policy assumptions and social reality?
Do beliefs about obligations vary between individuals and if so, on what basis?
Do most people regard responsibilities towards their relatives as a natural part of human life, as part of a moral code, or as agreements to be negotiated?
The research proceeds in two main stages: a survey of 1,000 individuals, followed by a more detailed, in-depth interview study of a sub-sample.

The primary aim of the project is to provide a critical analysis of the public sector's role and philosophy as far as leisure is concerned.
The research investigates the investment made by the public sector in leisure, the limits to public sector involvement in leisure, and the development of the framework within which the various public bodies operate.
This study involves an examination at three distinct levels of the action of those in the public sector.
The first means identifying these issues that are critical to leisure policy and the means by which decision-makers operate to achieve the goals established by legislation or ministerial directives.
Second, an appreciation is being sought of the inter-relationship between organisations by appraising the resources needed (eg legal, economic and information resources), their origins, the way in which they are distributed and the inter-organisational network within which these transactions take place.
Third, different aspects within organisations are being investigated.
The project involves an extensive programme of fieldwork, interviewing those responsible for leisure provision, regulation and management within local authorities, central government and government agencies.

The voluntary and private child care sectors are facing perhaps one of their most serious crises.
Whilst many voluntary and private child care organisations have diversified, the majority remain heavily committed in terms of both human and capital resources to the provision of residential care.
Furthermore, almost all of the residential care they supply is provided under contract to local authority social services departments.
In the last few years, this has meant a considerable drop in the numbers of children placed in homes outside the public sector, in turn creating financial and professional difficulties.
Local authority demand has not only fallen but changed in emphasis, with the consequence that a much higher proportion of the children today placed in these homes have behavioural, emotional, physical and other difficulties.
In part, these demand changes reflect broader issues regarding the contracting out of local authority services.
These demand changes have been one source of the escalating costs of voluntary and private residential child care and this escalating cost has, in a time of severe fiscal constraint, itself contributed to a further fall in the demand for contracted out places by local authorities.
This project examines local authority demand for voluntary and private residential child care in the context of falling numbers of children both in care and in residential accommodation, and in the context of financial constraints in public, voluntary and private sectors alike.
The study is building on the substantial data collection made by the Personal Social Services Research Unit in 1983 from these sectors.

Although only small minorities of the whole elderly population aged 65 or over live in institutions or with younger relatives, the proportions among the over 80's in these types of ‘supported’ households are much higher.
It is this age group which is now growing at the fastest rate and the support of the sometimes frail ‘old’ is an important policy issue.
This research will be based on information included in the OPCS Longitudinal Study, a record linkage study which includes information from the 1971 and 1981 Censuses for 1% of the population.
The 1971 characteristics of elderly people who by 1981 had moved into institutions or to live with younger relatives will be compared with the characteristics of those remaining in their own homes.
The aim of this will be to identify factors associated with continuing residential independence.
The project will also involve looking at the circumstances of younger relatives joined by an elderly person.
A third element of the research will be to look at the geographical impact of ‘support’ moves by the elderly.King's College, London, Age Concern Institute of Gerontology.

The aims of this research are twofold: 1.
To examine the relationship between the changing construction of the problem of marriage and divorce and the changing approach of the marital agencies — the National Marriage Guidance Council, the Institute of Marital Studies (originally the Family Discussion Bureau) the Jewish and Scottish Marriage Guidance Council and the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council.
In exploring the construction of marriage and divorce as a public issue, we will focus in particular on the role of politics, the law and the Church and the nature of the interaction between these and the various professional and public figures involved in the development of marital work in Britain since the 1930's.
2.
To conduct an in-depth cast study of the National Marriage Guidance Council (NMGC) in order to examine the dynamics of survival and change within a voluntary organisation.
This is particularly critical at a time when the agency is seeking to implement a report prepared by a team of management consultants which emphasises the importance of ‘seizing the challenge of change’ in a deliberate bid to alter the direction of the organisation.
We will investigate the ways in which the NMGC has adjusted to the shifts analysed in the first part of the research, in respect to relations with central government and other agencies as well as in its professional practice management.
The links between the two parts of the study will be crucial.
Dynamics of survival within the NMGC must be related to the role which the organisation has defined and redefined for itself in the light of a changing understanding of marital problems over time and in relation to the work of other agencies.
Similarly, changes in approach cannot be isolated from questions of organisational development and survival and in fact may be the key to their understanding.
Our main conceptual framework in the first part of the research is one which builds upon a dual understanding of marriage as both relationship and institution.
Our intention is to explore the ways in which these complementary, but at times, conflicting aspects of marriage may vary in their relationship one to the other over time.
Accordingly, we shall try to establish a framework for exploring ideas about marriage, locating these and the direct experiences of those involved in a detailed historical context which takes account of the interrelationships between the public and the private.
This will be particularly important in our efforts to explore the ways in which the private traumas of married couples have found their way on to the public agendas of churchmen, politicians, policy makers and others over a fifty year period.
It is our intention to explore the hypothesis that public perceptions of marriage have shifted from an emphasis on its public/institutional to its private/relational aspects.
We shall explore this hypothesis through an analysis of the public debate on marriage and divorce, drawing on government, church and legal documents.
Against this background we shall consider the part that those involved in the marital agencies have played both in constructing the social problems of marriage and divorce and in responding to it.
We shall examine professionals' ideas about marriage, concepts of intervention and styles of service delivery.
Whereas the emphasis in the first part of the research will be on the interaction between the construction of ideas about marriage and the ideologies and development of the marital agencies, the focus of the second part will narrow into a detailed case study of the activities and development of one organisation, the National Marriage Guidance Council.
It is our intention to add to the literature on the dynamics of transition within voluntary organisations by studying the NMGC in detail over time.
We shall examine in particular the extent to which recent changes in the NMGC represent survival strategies predicated primarily on the assumption that the organisation should continue and only secondarily on a clear conception of the service which it can should provide.
Drawing together the two strands of our research proposal, we would hypothesise that the process of accommodation to changes in the social construction of marriage and marriage problems which forced the NMGC to reassess its goals, also involved a shift from a movement broadly committed to the defence of the institution of marriage to an increasingly specialised agency, treating marital problems as the products of new-type privatised marital relationships.
Aspects of this shift will be explored along four key dimensions: 1) relations with Central Government, 2) relations with other agencies, 3) internal aspects of management and accountability, 4) voluntarism and professionalism.
Both parts of the research will use historical and sociological methods.
It is intended to analyse both published and unpublished documentary material, using the oral testimony of key informants — both public figures and key individuals within NMGC — as a means of ‘triangulating’ the material.
For the first part of the research we will rely primarily on printed government and church documents; printed material on marriage and the family (the NMGC has a readily available and fairly comprehensive collection of books and pamphlets published in the 1930s and 1940s); books, reports and ephemera produced by the marital agencies; and professional journals.
For the second part of the research we will rely on the published and unpublished material of the NMGC and on interviews with key informants.
The NMGC's archives at Rugby have been inspected and are extensive; access to the archives has been successfully negotiated.
In the interviews we expect to pursue a ‘network’ approach, linking leaders in marriage guidance to other organisations and issues.
The study arises out of our collective research interests in marriage and the family.
We share interests in oral history, qualitative research and social theory.
We intend to use the findings of the research to promote a more informed debate on the role of the marital agencies in contemporary society.

Child abuse arouses considerable public concern and causes much personal misery for parents and children.
The inability to protect children from such abuse has been the subject of a succession of inquiry reports, in which the main reason given for this failure has been some failing in procedure such as the lack of communication among the agencies involved.
This assumes that social worker has the information available to them to make correct decisions.
However, it is clear that the parents will often not admit their true feelings about the child and the incident, acting rather in a way which they perceive to be desirable in the circumstances, to gain the return of their children.
This project will be concerned with the views and attitudes of parent, child and social worker, and their effects on outcome for the family.
The process of intervention will be studied over a four month period from the time of first referral.
The parents will be interviewed on attitude to child, values in parenting and views of the intervention; the social worker on their views of parenting and of specific family; and the children on their understanding of the intervention and attitude towards their parents.
About 100 cases will be drawn from three Scottish regions and cases taken as they are referred to specific teams.

Under the impetus of the Government's community care policies in England and Wales, people are being moved out of mental handicap hospitals into community placements.
The discharge rate of people aged 15 or over has almost doubled since 1982.
By comparison with Britain, however, this process of moving people out of hospitals haws progressed much further in the United States.
Many times more people have moved out of the big state hospitals over a larger number of years and a great deal more research on outcomes has been done.
The purpose of this study is to draw out the lessons of US experience as they relate to the situation in Britain.
This award will be used to fund a research visit to the USA in order to obtain archival data about the effects of this policy, to talk with public officials about the achievements and failings of their relocation programmes; and to investigate at local level the similarities and differences between the American and British contexts.

Ward sisters in modern hospitals have in addition to their direct nursing roles, an important administrative one.
In particular, they undertake a wide variety of co-ordinating tasks.
They must interact with nurses, doctors, administrators, supplies, dietitians, social workers, ministers of religion, patients' relatives, representatives of the social security and other outside agencies, and probably many more.
It is not known whether the proper flow of information needed for those co-ordinating tasks is best ensured by continuing present practices, by having a human agent (say a housekeeper or ward clerk), or by provision of some technological assistance (say a small cheap microcomputer system or some form of electronic mail).
The research attempts to investigate:
(1)
The amount, type and frequency of interchange of information;
(2)
The adequacy of current methods of providing and exchanging this information;
(3)
The degree, if any, to which cheap technological aids might help to lighten the burden of controlling this information and improve the efficiency of exchanging it.

The aim of this research is to examine the strategies which prisoners and their families adopt in coming to terms with custody and its various social consequences.
Although there is a growing literature on prisons, prison research arbitrarily stops at the prison gates.
There has been no major study of prisoners' families for nearly a quarter of a century, and what has been done tends to remain firmly outside the prison walls.
Moreover prisoners' families are often regarded either as an essential bulwark against future recidivism of those in custody, or else helpless victims of circumstances in need of support.
The prisoners themselves are often seen as failures, who ought to be made to support their families, though the system does little to help bring that about.
This study, to be carried out by Professor Roy King and Dr Kathleen McDermott of the Centre for Social Policy Research and Development at UCNW, will be one of the first to include both prisoners and their families in the same study.
It will explore how they make sense of their predicament, and how, and in what circumstances, they devise separate or joint coping strategies to enable them to survive.

The post-war rise in divorce has attracted much debate amongst policy makers, welfare practitioners and the public at large, and yet the work of the probation service in providing welfare reports and related services to the courts in such situations has remained largely unresearched in the face of the preoccupation with their work with offenders.
Current proposals for changes in family law, recent criticisms by courts of changes in practice and varying standards, and recent research by the Conciliation Project Unit for the Lord Chancellor's Department all raise important questions about how these services should be provided.
At present however, service managers lack information about the nature of current practice, the demands made on welfare officers by courts and divorcing families, and the resource implications of these.
This research will provide such information and provide a clear picture of current practice, identifying issues raised by this.
Five probation areas will be studied, in close co-operation with the probation service both nationally and locally.
The research will involve monitoring the work of court welfare officers, interviews with key court personnel, service managers and welfare officers, and detailed analysis of interviews between welfare officers and divorcing parents recorded during the course of their enquiries.

The British health care system is once again the focus of intense policy debate.
Recent reforms could bring about significant changes in the organisation of the National Health Service and in the delivery of care.
The research aims to evaluate the effect of policy change for the distribution of health care across different groups in the British population.
Both the current reforms and other possible changes which have been suggested in recent debates of the health service will be examined.
The project will initially seek to establish the distribution of care and finance for that care in the present system.
The results will be compared to similar exercises being carried out in other European Community countries.
Subsequently, the project will focus on possible reforms and examine the extent to which they will alter the distribution of either care or payment for that care.
This part of the project will involve building of a simulation model of the consumer side of the UK health sector.

There has been much controversy in the 1980s about the role and future of the Welfare State.
In particular, attention has been directed to such questions as whether it is being dismantled or whether its frontiers are being narrowed by privatisation.
This project, however, starts with a different question: is the Welfare State being replaced by the Regulatory State?
The assumption, which the project sets out to test, is that the State is increasingly withdrawing from the business of providing services but strengthening and widening its role as the regulator of services produced by others in the private and voluntary sectors.
Accordingly the project will examine developments in the regulatory machinery D ranging from legislation to inspection D in a variety of services, including health and education.
If this indeed is the pattern, it is clearly important to know whether or not regulation is effective in maintaining standards and what its impact is on the supply of services.
The project will therefore seek to identify the main implications of the trend towards the Regulatory State and is intended to be the first step towards a major research programme investigating the potentials and problems of regulation in practice across the whole spectrum of what we used to describe as the Welfare State.

Since the unification of Vietnam in 1975 under the government of the communist forces of North Vietnam, there has been a steady exodus of Vietnamese.
In 1988, more than 14,000 arrived in Hong Kong but there were few offers of permanent resettlement for them elsewhere.
The Hong Kong Government decided to introduce screening procedures to distinguish refugees from those who were leaving only for economic reasons.
The British Government has agreed that Vietnamese who are found not to be refugees should be returned to Vietnam.
A small aid package will be given to those who return to assist them in their resettlement.
The study aims to examine the repatriation of the Vietnamese from Hong Kong and to explore the related development issues.
An investigation will be conducted of the motivations and support networks of those people passing through the screening and return procedures in Hong Kong.
The focus moves next to a region in Vietnam from which some of the asylum seekers have come, in order to compare the circumstances of those who decide to go and those who remain.
This search follows a study carried out in the refugee camps of Southeast Asia and supported by ESRC.
The principle methods of investigation will be questionnaires and informal interviews.

The purpose of the research is to analyse and evaluate the development of policy towards the modernisation of the French civil service since 1981, and more particularly since 1988.
Attention is focused on the programme of public sector renewal initiated by Prime Minister Rocard, its underlying values and intellectual coherence.
The prospects of its successful implementation, given the resilience of the centralising Jacobin tradition and the historical legacy of the permanent failure of permanent reform, are addressed.
The research agenda encompasses the challenge posed by public management-type reforms to established modes of policy planning and administrative evaluation in French government, and the difficulties encountered in bringing about new administrative values and behaviour in a country where public administration is regulated by administrative law norms that privilege the State in its dealings with citizens.
The research on progress in implementing the Socialist programme of public service renewal is based on documentary sources, as supplemented by personal interviews with officials conducted by the author.

Maintenance of self-esteem is a key element in successful ageing.
Contrary to expectations studies show that most people continue to regard themselves positively as they grow older.
Relatively little, however, is known about the bases or sources of self-esteem in later life, and how they change over time.
In this project as many as possible of the 80 to 90 survivors from a sample of older people, who were selected from two group general practices in Southampton to take part in earlier studies, will be reinterviewed.
They were first interviewed 13 years ago in 1977-78 and were last interviewed in 1988.
All are now aged over 78 years.
The earlier studies included assessments of self-esteem and sources of self-esteem, medical problems, disability and need of help, activities and social contacts, and other indices of well-being.
These will be repeated, but the opportunity will also be taken to collect more detail on people's responses to recent illness and on self-perceptions.
Diverse ways of coping with the stress caused by illness will be identified and any links with self-esteem investigated.
The precursors of lowered self-esteem and poor coping will also be examined.

The Education Reform Act 1988 introduced a new system by which Local Education Authorities (LEAs) allocate budgets to schools, called formula funding.
Although each LEA's formula is unique, many schemes allocate a proportion of resources according to the incidence of social disadvantage in different schools.
This project will focus on this particular element of formula funding.
Concentrating on five case study LEAs, processes of policy-making, implementation and policy evolution will be investigated.
Attention will focus on the factors and considerations which affected LEA decisions to recognise social disadvantage and target the allocation of resources towards disadvantaged schools.
The research will also trace the development of policies and identify the implications for future policy-making, local and national.
In addition, from the analysis of reports from a sample of schools, there will be an assessment of how resources allocated on the grounds of social disadvantage are spent, ie. whether they benefit children in need.

The ESRC have recently commissioned research into aspects of social, economic and political change in Europe with a focus on Eastern Europe.
A second phase of funding is now envisaged.
A priority area for further funding is social policy and provision.
One of the consequences of the marketisation and political pluralisation now taking place in central and Eastern Europe in the wake of the revolutions of 1989 is the removal of the state administered system of full employment and price subsidy.
New social policy mechanisms to compensate for these changes will need to be developed.
This seminar will bring together leading social policy researchers from the UK and Central and Eastern Europe to advise the ESRC on the focii of further research into these developments.

The aim of this research was to find out which groups of the population were having in-patient treatment in private hospitals and NHS ‘pay beds’, why they were choosing to do so and what information was made available to them.
The research was in two phases: first, a survey of 1070 patients in eight private hospitals and pay beds in three NHS hospitals and, second, interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of 60 patients.
The results showed that private patients were predominantly middle aged and were from Social Classes I and II.
Most had ‘gone private’ in order to avoid NHS waiting lists or to take advantage of their health insurance.
Others mentioned the convenience of having a booked admission date and better surroundings and care.
Women, in particular, felt that the private sector had qualities which were sometimes lacking in the NHS.
The research concluded that, in some respects, patients could and did behave like consumers in a marketplace, shopping around for good quality care.
However, they were poorly informed about costs, knew little about the alternatives to private in-patient treatment (especially the option of NHS care) and showed little inclination to choose their doctor or hospital.

social policy, the market, the law, the family and the voluntary sector differ from each other?
Do social security systems provided by the state draw on all or only some of these and how does the mix differ between countries and with what effect?
The funding os for a one year preliminary project which will develop indicators by which the principles can be characterised.
It will then classify the social security systems of a range of industrialized countries by related criteria, for example, entitlements, access, benefit levels, modes of delivery.
This will involve familiarization, mainly from secondary sources, with details of the structure, scope, funding, organization, and regulations and instructions governing the practice of these systems The intention is to prepare the ground for a later study, in greater depth, of a smaller number of countries.
The aim will be to evaluate the outcomes of the different social security systems and the extent to which these are determined by the particular value mixes which are reflected in their respective systems.

But what of the social science base?
Prior to this study the ESRC was aware that it is responsible for probably no more than 10 to 20 per cent of social science support in higher education.
Little was known, however, of whether ESRC support was more important in some areas than others or whether, in areas where there is significant support from other sources, ESRC's support for basic or strategic research (as applied to applied) might nevertheless be critical.
The study assembled evidence on the sources of funds for social science research in Britain during the 1980's and the patterns of expenditure by subject and type of research, and examined changes in the patterns of funding over time.
Research institutions were asked to provide information about grants and contracts received during the period 1984/85 and 1989/90.

In the past poverty standards have sometimes been defined in terms of the cost of buying the minimum basket of goods regarded as necessary for the maintenance of health.
However, the vagaries of how people actually spend their incomes and the growing evidence that health is relative rather than absolute poverty, means that we have very little idea of how income is related to health in practice.
This research project is part of a research program intended to identify any causal component in the association between low income and poor health.
Using existing data sets, it will make initial estimates of the scale of any effect which low incomes might have on the health if the elderly in Britain, and go on to assess the likely role of some intervening variables which might account for the close correlation between income distribution and longevity in developed countries.
Empirical and theoretical materical from these sources will be used to assess the feasibility of mounting a randomised control trial of the effects of low incomes on health.

In recent years there has been remarkable expansion in the provision of humanitarian assistance for refugees by internationally based NGOs backed by major donors.
Host countries view this outcome with growing concern.
NGOs appear to present challenges to the authority of government agencies.
Evidence also suggests that indigenously based NGOs, unable to penetrate the now well established assistance regime, are being frustrated in their demands for recognition.
This project will investigate these issues in the context of the provision of aid for one million plus Mozambican refugees in Malawi and Zimbabwe.
The study will examine the role NGOs and the institutional relationships between them and governments.
It will consider the conditions under which government policies have been conducive or a constraint to NGO activity.
It will assess the extent to which dependency on international agencies has been established at the expense of indigenous agencies and whether emergency provision has been sustained by the exclusion of developmental aid in a protracted refugee situation.
The study will have immediate relevance both in strengthening the capacity of the agencies dealing with the crisis and through transferability elsewhere.
The project is co-funded by the Pew Foundation (USA) with an additional $31000.

Recent comparative studies of social security beneficiaries in the OECD area has shown that lone parents constitute a significant and growing proportion of the poor in member countries.
However, this is not true of all countries.
Researchers using the Luxembourg Income Study microdata have shown that in Sweden and West Germany lone parent family incomes approximate the income of couple-headed families on a per capita basis.
The purpose of this research project is to discover why lone parent poverty rates vary across countries: is it simply that some transfer systems are more generous?
What role does labour force participation play in keeping lone parents out of poverty?
Are there significant differences in transfer systems which encourage work and income support to be combined?
Are there significant differences in the demographic characteristics of lone parents in different countries (eg: age, level of education, race, ages and numbers of children) and do these affect their ability to participate in the labour force?
This project will use data on the incomes and demographic characteristics of lone parents from the Luxembourg Income Study database to compare the position of lone parents in the UK (1986) with lone parents in: Australia (1986), Canada (1987), France (1984), Germany (1984), Italy (1986), Luxembourg (1985), the Netherlands (1987), Sweden (1987), and the United States (1985).

Community Health Councils provide a major platform for the consumer voice in the NHS.
Their potential importance has risen with the emphasis that the 1990 NHS Act has given to consumer-responsiveness.
Yet the role, function, impact and effectiveness of the Community Health Councils is imperfectly understood and questions have been raised concerning their future.
This research project builds upon an earlier survey of Community Health Councils which explored aspects of ‘organisational culture’.
The present work aims to investigate the linkage between ‘organisational culture’ and effectiveness with regard to consumer representation.
Particular attention will be paid to the implications of the 1990 health care reforms for Community Health Councils.
The research will focus on a representative sample of Community Health Councils and will involve document analysis and interviews with Community Health Council staff and members, heath care purchasers and providers and the general public.

Major changes to the social security system were introduced in April 1992: rationalisation and extension of current disability benefits into a Disability Living Allowance and the introduction of a new Disability Working Allowance.
Benefits for people with disabilities were excluded from the 1988 social security reforms until the OPCS had concluded its disability surveys.
Published in 1988/89, the surveys established that 75% of people with disabilities rely on state benefits as their main source of income.
The Government's reforms proposed a more comprehensive and coherent system of disability benefits and the Secretary of State for Social Security, Tony Newton, promised ‘a better life for Britain's disabled people’,(The Way Ahead, Benefits for Disabled People, Cm 917, HMSO, 1990).
The OPCS surveys, on whose findings the benefit reforms were premised, have been criticised as significantly underestimating the extra costs of disability.
This study will examine these extra costs and the extent of low income among people with disabilities and determine the extent to which the presence of a disability contributes to such impoverishment.
The impact of the new benefits on the living standards of disabled people will then be assessed together with an evaluation of the changes in the benefit adjudication system.
The project, one of a series undertaken by these researchers, forms part of their wider study of Welfare Benefits in transition.

a ‘bottom-up’ approach designed to explore the local perception, experience and significance of central and local relations;
(ii)
a focus on both statutory and non-statutory social services in selected localities in an attempt to explore part of what Rhodes calls ‘Community autonomy’, rather than merely his notion of ‘local discretion’;
(iii)
a comparison between different ‘types of policy’ in relation to two client groups;
(iv)
an identification of policy content, or ‘types of policy’, in two senses — a distinction between ‘service’ and ‘resource’policies and between policies towards ‘preferred service systems’and ‘care or treatment regimes’;
(v)
a particular focus on how and how far central-local relations are a means of articulating service policies (objectives, goals and service paradigms)— as opposed to resource controls, financing planning (capital and revenue), and capital project design specifications — and the interaction of these different components of central-local relations;
(vi)
an assumption that central-local relations are affected by local-local relations as well as those between centre and periphery;
(vii)
a mapping of such local networks, as well as a comparison of the ‘content’, ‘structure’ and ‘style’of central-local relations in each of the local agencies.
Selected policy issues will be used to explore these aspects of central-local relations, using documentary study and structured interviews.

Towards the end of the 1980s there was a growing awareness that children could be sexually abused not only by an individual acting on his or her own, but also by adults acting in concert.
Such cases of organised abuse may place great demands upon child protection agencies, in terms of both overall resources and special practice requirements.
The first stage of this study will consist of a postal questionnaire, sent to all social service departments and police forces in England and Wales, plus the NSPCC, to gather information on the prevalence and basic characteristics of known cases of organised abuse.
The second stage og the project will involve more detailed studies in several selected areas.
Police and social work records will be searched and members of staff will be interviewed.
This work will be used to draw up a definition and typology of cases of organised abuse, and to identify significant practice and inter-agency issues.
It will also allow the validity and reliability of the national survey to be assessed and so produce a more accurate figure for the incidence and prevalence of known cases.
Further data will be provided by case studies in two or three areas and by searches of secondary sources of material.

Traditionally, management-staff relations in local government have been relatively harmonious with few serious disputes.
But more recently, these relations have come under strain and authorities have experienced rising levels of industrial action.
It is supposed that the major factor behind this trend is the financial pressure faced by local authorities, especially as a result of reductions in the amount of central government grant that they receive.
The research investigates the significance of this pressure for the management- staff relationship and the extent to which union organisations influence authorities' response to these pressures.
The research consists of case-studies in four local authorities.

It is generally agreed that the young long-term unemployed present particular and often unfamiliar problems in the field of social, educational and employment policy.
There now exists a variety of provision for education, training, work experience and advice supported by central government, local government and voluntary bodies, but experience suggests that some of those most in need of such services are relatively ill prepared to take advantage of the opportunities they offer.
This small-scale study aims to describe and evaluate one initiative in this field.
It concerns an informal training scheme developed by a voluntary youth work agency, which decided to build on its existing contacts with a group of long-term unemployed young people by offering a course combining social skills with basic business skills.
The aim of the training is to encourage and equip the young people to engage, with the support of other services, in economic activity and if possible to start a cooperative business.
The research follows one group of young people through the course and is intended to throw light on its effectiveness in achieving the agency's aims; on the responses of the young consumers; and on the appropriateness of the techniques and resources of such agencies in undertaking this kind of work.

This project concerns social policy in Hong Kong.
In this context Hong Kong exhibits a number of unusual features.
Some relate to the free-enterprise market nature of its economy which, superficially, resembles the state of affairs in Britain as described in Karl Marx's Capital of 1867 — but modified here (thanks to mass immigration from mainland China) by, for instance, massive public housing investment.
Some relate to its administrative and policy models, which derive from Britain but are here applied to a Chinese population.
Others relate to the unusual if not unique status of its government which, as an appointive bureaucracy, has evolved policy in the absence of any electoral considerations.
The way in which social policy has evolved, the directions it has taken, its appropriateness to perceived problems, therefore stand in marked contrast to western models and justify examination in their own right.
However such an examination is the more timely — and likely to be the more revealing — in the light of the London — Peking accords on the transition to Chinese authority, in so far as this last may affect the nature of the bureaucracy, modify its practices and, possibly, inject popular consultation on some issues.
The study therefore embraces two main concerns.
The first is to analyse, account for and document Hong Kong social policy as so far evolved and to attempt to assess its future lines of development in the light of the London — Peking accords.
The second is to relate these findings to the analytical terms and theoretical models on social policy developed in the West.
This is intended to be a topical, practical inquiry, but one whose findings may add to our understanding of social policy development in general.

Due to changes in the demographic structure, there will be an increase in the number of people of pensionable age who are still able to make and interested in making an active contribution to society.
In addition, more people may be subject to early retirement.
A study is being conducted in two rural areas to examine the implications of these changes.
Both the theories and methods are drawn from the traditions of social anthropology.
Cross cultural comparisons are developed from the study of an area in England and another in France.
The main method is that of participant observation and qualitative fieldwork.
Attention is paid to the implications of a possible double redundancy of retired agricultural workers and tenant or peasant farmers and their families whose past work is now rendered obsolete by machines and agri-business.
Their experience of ageing is compared not only with that of other indigenous elderly people, but also with urban incomers.
The expectations of the latter is examined in the light of the rural idyll.
The symbolic ordering of ageing with specific reference to the notion of time, will be analysed in the context of gender, historical differences and the total context.

The lifestyles experienced by people who live in homes for the elderly are undoubtedly shaped by the nature of the physical setting they occupy as well as the social and organisational regimes which characterise such establishments.
The relative importance of each of these influences is not, however, fully understood though it is an issue which has both humanitarian and economic implications.
The object of this research is to further consider material, collected in 1980/81 from residents and staff in a representative sample of local authority homes throughout England with a view to developing a multivariate model of the factors which impinge upon the daily lives of those who live and work in old people's homes.
During the model building process, the research focuses on the development of a number of typologies concerning home type, resident characteristics, and staff ‘culture’, and draws upon both quantitative and qualitative material.
The problems which are likely to be encountered in attempting to mesh such divergent data are both technical and philosophical.
This attempt is being fully charted with a view to furthering the methodological debate which surrounds this aspect of data production and analysis.
The overall aim is thus centred upon producing, in the short term, substantive material concerning the various interactions that take place in old people's homes.
In the longer term, such material will extend discussion at the level of policy and practice with particular implications for developing a consumer focus to performance review within homes.

Until a few years ago, consideration of race issues at policy levels was rare in most local authority social services departments, even in areas with substantial black populations.
Some changes in practice, and in ways of delivering services, did take place, but usually as the result of initiatives by individual social workers or managers rather than as part of an overall department plan.
Recently, however, many departments have recognised that there are issues to be considered, and that these relate, for example, to employment as well as service delivery, and to indirect as well as direct discrimination and racism.
They have begun to review policies and practices, and to implement changes.
These developments are studied through field work in four social services departments.
In each, the researcher identifies aspects of the department's functioning which attempt to take account of the ethnic and racial composition of local populations; examines the issues which arise and how these are dealt with; and explores the ways in which the department monitors and evaluates the changes which are taking place.
The methods used in the project include sitting in on meetings as an observer, interviews and informal discussions, and reading relevant documents.

One-parent families form a substantial, and growing, proportion of all families with dependent children.
The latest estimates suggest that about one in eight of all families are headed by a lone parent and this certainly under-estimates the number of families who have been, or will be, one-parent families.
Many studies have shown that one-parent families tend to have low incomes and that a large proportion — now more than half — rely mainly on state benefits for their incomes.
But there is no specific social security benefit for lone parents and the general income support available to all families with children may not be relevant to the particular needs of lone-parent families.
This study examines the living standards of low-income lone-parent families; in particular, the extent to which their incomes are adequate for their ‘needs’, whether their ‘needs’ are different from those of two-parent families and the persistence of low- income amongst one-parent families.
The analysis is based on data from two linked surveys of low income families (the Family Finances Survey and the Family Resources Survey) carried out for the Department of Health and Social Security in 1978/79.

Housing
Dominant themes in current academic and policy debates focus on the uneven impact of social and economic change, the relationships between the housing market and the labour market and the transformations of family life, life-styles and living standards.
There is a renewal of interest in localities and the relationships between broad structural changes and social and economic change at the local level.
Housing occupies a prominent place in these debates.
Tenure divisions are argued to represent key divisions in British Society.
For some, housing represents a store and source of wealth.
It is asserted that privileged position in the housing market reflects and acts upon privileged position in the labour market; and wide differences between localities and between different groups within localities are likely to emerge.
These and other related issues are addressed through a programme of research at different levels of analysis and employing a variety of research methods.
It involves computer based work on social and spatial change at the national, regional and local authority levels; locality research on housing markets and labour markets; household research on the unemployed, the elderly and newly married couples.
The research involves the analysis and development of an extensive data base for all local authority areas in England; use of longitudinal data from the one per cent sample from 1971/81 Census available through the City University; locality studies involving interviews with key agencies, institutions and firms supplemented by related desk research; social survey work on the unemployed; and ethnographic research on specific groups.
These methods would be used to triangulate on the key themes.

Since the publication in 1982 of the Barclay Report, Social Workers: Their Role and Tasks, many social services departments in the UK have been searching for ways of putting into practice ideas about community-based social work.
Such a change of direction has major implications for the way services are delivered and for staff roles.
In France, the nearest equivalent to social services departments has developed within their structures the ‘circonscription de service social’, a co-ordinating and enabling mechanism for linking departments to other agencies and to community groups.
Decentralization policies by the French government over the last few years have re-enforced the significance of the ‘Circonscription’ as a means whereby agencies can maintain and develop their links with communities.

There is considerable debate about the future development of social welfare policy in Britain.
A variety of positions exist ranging from free market, through welfare pluralist (in which a mix of state, voluntary, market and family forms of provision coexist), welfare corporatist (in which trade unions and employers would have more say in the planning of welfare), to alternative social planning (in which social services would be deprofessionalised and democratised).
A similar discussion, at a more muted level, is taking place in Hungary.
This research, to be carried out jointly with the Institute of Sociology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, will clarify the extent to which this debate is similar in both East and West.
It will also investigate, by means of a secondary analysis of public opinion surveys and by means of indepth interviews with a population sample, how far popular opinion in both countries is receptive to each of the welfare reform strategies.
The research should contribute to understanding about the relative roles played by material circumstances and political mobilisation in the shaping of attitudes to welfare.
The research results will be presented at a conference on social policy in Eastern Europe with participants from Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, USA, Canada, Norway, Australia and New Zealand.

The ESRC first became interested in research on children in care at the end of the 1970s, following a request from Dr Barnardo's to consider research needs in this area.
Exploratory work revealed little relevant research on this important and expensive area of social services provision.
The Council therefore agreed to support an initiative in this area and the research commenced early in 1981.
Mr Frank Loughran of the University of Bristol (Department of Social Administration) is Research Co-ordinator for this initiative.
The first phase of this initiative funded seven projects pertaining to the following themes: the implications of social and economic changes in the country on children in care; the effects of regional differences in administrative and policy procedures on children in care; evaluation of alternative forms of care; and the perception of care by children and other parties.
The seven projects are now concluded and the resultant findings are currently being disseminated.
One of the first major presentations of the results of the first phase of the initiative was to senior staff of the Children's Division and the Social Services Inspectorate of the DHSS.
A summary of key findings is to be circulated to social work agencies, training courses and other relevant bodies.
A DHSS/ESRC steering group has been established to co-ordinate plans and organise some joint dissemination events.
Following the success of the first phase of this initiative, a second phase has been planned in collaboration with DHSS and DES.
The initiative has been allocated £150,000 from ESRC funds over the next three years.
Research should begin in 1986 in two areas that have received only minimal research attention: the education of children in care and the effects of major social, economic and demographic trends on the need for child care and the nature of the services provided.

This project builds upon two major pieces of work undertaken in the recent programme of ESRC/Sports Council Joint Panel research.
One project was on the role of the Public Sector, the other on the role of the Voluntary Sector.
The intention of the current work is to explore the perceptions of the voluntary sector held by local authority staff and to consider this in the light of their policies and practices for contacting and working with (or for) the voluntary groups in their areas.
Are such perceptions accurate, distorted or partial and to what extent do they enable public sector staff to meet, merge with, miss or perhaps even collide with the aspirations of their local groups?
The work also aims to place such dynamic relationships in the context of pressures on local government at this time and the context of an emerging leisure profession.
It is intended to disseminate the results widely within the ‘leisure community’ and to this end a seminar and other events are already timetabled.

Sociological and anthropological literature on South Asian minorities has generally concentrated on the significance of caste and sectarian communities as a basis of primary affiliation.
In the context of social change brought about by migration to the United Kingdom, individuals belonging to these communities have often sought to develop voluntary associations which are not reducible to primary social ties of caste and kinship.
It is this particular level of grouping that this research aims to investigate.
The aim of the research is to explain the relationship between South Asian migration to Bristol and the formation of voluntary associations.
A preliminary survey of these associations shows that South Asians have formed associations on the basis of all-Asian, subcontinental, national, regional, socio-religious, linguistic, gender and age criteria in the framework of their position influenced by class and race in Britain.
Apart from providing valuable historical and ethnographic information, voluntary associations raise important theoretical issues such as the question of relationship between voluntary and involuntary groupings and the influence of the latter on the former along with the importance of class and race in the development of voluntary associations.
Finally, in a free democratic society, voluntary associations provide a training ground for participation in wider politics.
It is expected that this investigation will show the nature of the connection between South Asian voluntary associations and the wider realm of national and local politics in Bristol.

Crime prevention has received increasing recent attention from researchers and policy makers.
The only publicly funded workers professionally concerned with crime prevention are police crime prevention officers.
There is, however, no systematic knowledge of what crime prevention officers do.
This project sets out to help rectify this by providing an overview of police crime prevention practices in England and Wales.
A short interview is to be conducted with every Force Crime Prevention Officer in England and Wales.
Visits will be made to a small number of contrasting forces for a fairly prolonged period.
In this way, a wide variety of practices can be identified and studied.
In addition to this descriptive overview, issues which will also be discussed include: the relationship between ‘theory’ and ‘practice’in crime prevention; how and why activities come to be defined as crime prevention activities; changes in the role of crime prevention officers and the increasing importance (in theory, at least) of crime prevention in the work of all police officers; liaison with non-police bodies including crime prevention panels, neighbourhood watch schemes, schools etc., and finally, the use of new technology in the prevention of crime.
Apart from a published overview, the project will generate a source book of practices, visual aids, software etc to distribute to participating forces and other agencies concerned with crime prevention.

The project is concerned with identifying those household characteristics that are systematically related to their position in the income or living standard distribution.
The aim is to check whether the conventional view of the characteristics of poor households can be substantiated by close empirical investigation of large samples of households and whether the measure by which households are ranked makes a significant difference to the effectiveness of anti-poverty policies.
The conventional view of poverty is based solely on the distribution of net incomes.
Occasionally ad hoc adjustment is made for household size by reference to Supplementary Benefit scale rates.
This research will contrast this approach with a wider and more general one where household living standards depend on household size and income but also household working behaviour and future incomes.
Thus a household with say, current low net income may have high expected future incomes and we may want to take account of this in the design of policy.
The findings of this research will be embodied in a microcomputer program to allow policy analysts to investigate the effect of policies when such a general view of poverty is adopted.

The research examines the impact of the recent boom in the provision of sheltered housing for sale in broadening the housing opportunities and choice available to the elderly; assesses the consequences of such developments for the activities of local authorities, housing associations and private housebuilders; and evaluates the impact of such initiatives on existing local housing markets.
While put in a national context, the practical focus of the research is on the operation of local housing markets in North West England.
The study examines a number of separate but interconnected issues:— the extent to which sheltered units for sale (both private developer and housing association LSE schemes) complement or extend established provision of specialised housing for the elderly, and the consequences of such developments on the operation of local housing markets;
— the impact of such developments on the internal organisational arrangements and strategies of local authorities and housing associations, and on the scope for public/private interaction;
— consumer preferences, and satisfaction with such sheltered schemes, and the migration behaviour and housing history of such residents.
The study involves the collection of local housing statistics from a sample of local authorities and housing associations; a survey of sheltered owners in a number of private and housing association schemes; and structured interviews with developers and estate agents concerning the impact of such schemes on local housing markets.

This project aims to contribute to the empirical analysis of the relative concept of poverty.
The intention is to exploit the data available in the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) and General Household Survey (GHS) for 1983.
Both Surveys contain a good deal of information relevant to the assessment of living standards including expenditure data (from the FES), indicators of health and social participation (from the GHS) and data on the possession of assets (from both Surveys).
These data will be used to develop profiles of the living standards of similar household types at different income levels.
From these profiles it will be established which, if any, indicators most clearly differentiate between groups at different income levels.
An index of living standards will be derived and related to income to assess whether there is a poverty ‘threshold'--a point on the income distribution where living standards decline sharply.
Of particular policy interest will be the analysis of the living standards of households dependent on supplementary benefit to assess how different they are from average living standards.
It is hoped that this work can contribute a better empirical basis to discussion about the adequacy of benefit levels.
Information on living standards in the FES and GHS is to be linked at the aggregate level of a given household type and income level.
Household types for analysis are chosen to span the life cycle.
Indicators of standards of living are estimated for each income level for each household type.
The living standards of households dependent on supplementary benefit are compared with that of similar households at different income levels.
The indicators which vary most with income are used to create a summary index of standard of living, using principal component analysis for specific household types and for all household types.
The relationship between income and the summary index can then be explored.

In recent years there has been increasing interest in the evaluation of performance in the public sector of the economy.
Not only is this seen as an important element in strengthening the drive to promote ‘value for money’ but it has also been seen as an important cog in the machinery of accountability to Parliament.
In both instances, emphasis has been put on the development of performance indicators as tools of evaluation.
This study will investigate how these tools have been designed, and how they are being used, across a variety of Whitehall departments and public services.
It will examine the way in which they have developed in, for example the National Health Service, Water Authorities and the Social Security system.
In doing so, the study will explore whether there is a common pattern across the public sector, irrespective of differences between services, or whether there are divergences between them.
Further, the study will also look at the use of performance indicators in the private sector of the economy in order to establish whether there is anything unique about the public sector or whether problems of evaluating performance are common to particular kinds of services.
In this, the aim of the study will be to promote learning across and between services and sectors of the economy.
For example, it may be that some services (or sectors) have developed better indicators of quality or effectiveness than others, and that it may be possible to transfer their experience.
In carrying out the work, the research will draw on both the available documentary evidence and on interviews with key actors.

The aim of this study is to secure a better understanding of the association between major social, economic and demographic trends and the pattern of children in care.
The effects of socio-economic change will be considered both in terms of the demand for child care and the supply of child care resources.
The project has three main components.
First, the collation and examination of long term trend data about children in care in order to identify and seek to explain significant changes and continuities.
In the second phase, small studies will be undertaken in a number of local authorities to assess the extent to which socio-economic factors account for variations in the rates of children in care in ‘similar’ authorities or for patterns of care that are at marked variance with national trends.
The study is linked with research at the Centre for Population Studies.

The education of children in care may be affected by many factors, including social background, care experience and attitudes of careers and schools.
With a view to identifying these factors, the researchers aim to study a group of nine to thirteen-year olds currently in medium/long-term foster care together with their carers and compare their social and educational experiences with those of a control group of children living with their own families but known to social services departments and receiving help.
In order to draw causal inferences about the educational consequences of being in care, a longitudinal study has been designed.
The educational progress of the children will be monitored over a two-year period.

This research is concerned with the uneven geographical impact of health care expenditures, both public and private, in England.
Although much is known about aggregate trends, relatively less research has been conducted into the impact of health care expenditures at the regional and district scale.
Four issues will be examined.
First, a major aim is to document the impact of current policies on levels of service provision at both regional and district scales.
Secondly, spatial aspects of health care employment have received little attention.
The effects of current policies on employment opportunities, and the consequences of initiatives designed to control the growth of NHS manpower and to subject ancillary services to competitive tendering, will be considered.
Thirdly, the uneven development of private health care will be examined and the implications for the future geography of health care considered.
Finally, a theme common to the various policies to be examined has been the changing character of central — local state relationships within the NHS.
The nature of these relationships will form an important fourth theme in the work.
The research will be conducted against the background of academic and political debates on the nature of the state and of the welfare state in particular.
In addition to published sources, the research will draw upon health authority papers and upon interviews with key personnel in selected localities.

Historians disagree on class conflict in southern Spain.
Some argue that conflict is community based, others that it is class based; some characterize the Anarchist Movement, which organised most working class protest in the area between 1870-1939, as millenarian; others contend that it was entirely rational.
This project is designed to produce an anthropological commentary on this historical debate.
Accounts of protest meetings, demonstrations, strikes, beatings, killings, riots and the reactions of the authorities to such incidents will be collected from local archives, oral histories, and publications.
These will be examined in the light of general anthropological theory and particular ethnographic studies of Andalusian culture and society.
Attention will be paid to problems of assessing evidence — for example, of treating oral histories as records of the past rather than as contemporary myths, of extrapolating from ethnography to history.
Among the topics to be considered are the cultural and social bases of class conflict, the politics of honour in the class struggle, symbolic action in class confrontations, millenarianism and rationality in the Anarchist Movement, the causes and incidence of violence as distinct from conflict.
Most of this work will be done in Spain between July 1985 and September 1986.

The urban food supply in Butare, Africa, is at risk due to ecological deterioration in the hinterland, population pressure, land hunger and a continuting incidence of localized droughts.
In the 1960s, the food supply system of Butare was reported to be adequate; twenty years later we have reasons to believe that Butare's steadily increasing population is finding it difficult to maintain the grip on familiar supply mechanisms.
Will Butare adjust to the drying up of its ‘normal’ supply channels?
And how will it adjust?
These are open questions that need to be answered urgently.
This project monitors the food supply situation in Butare, and considers whether the food problem could be alleviated in the short run via small but ecologically advantageous changes in food production.
Field data is collected with reference to:
(a)
the dietary practices and food-purchasing power of one lower-income urban commune;
(b)
past and present trends in urban consumption;
(c)
the scope of urban cultivation and the significance of urban-rural networks for food marketing.

This research specifically aims to develop computer models of knowledge pertaining to a complex group activity — the arranging of marriages in Lahore, Pakistan — based on information collected during three months field work.
These models are based on an assumption that in solving complex problems about, for example, marriage, people use fairly simple set of principles, which may or may not be consistent, and which interact in any given situation; their priority fixed by this situation.
Eliciting these principles from participants is complex, because they tend to give the prioritized principles.
Once these principles are formulated a model based on them can make not only explanatory retrodictive accounts of observed data, but predictions about new situations.
The research directly contributes to understanding the role of urban kinship and marriage decisions in urban Punjab, and to general fieldwork and analytic methods in anthropology, the accurate modelling of the relationship between human knowledge and the application of that knowledge in specific situations is important for the development of advanced computer applications.
The research thus has implications for the development of knowledge-based systems, especially re-use of methods and data in new contexts, methods of eliciting and modelling knowledge, and understanding the properties of knowledge that is distributed over several individuals.

This is a largely theoretical and somewhat abstract research project.
Its concern is the working out of the manner in which production, coercion, and cognition enter into various societies and types of society.
The research is based on the assumption that most of the contemporary ideas on this crucial topic date back to the 19th century, and that some of them at any rate are by now dated.
But it is not merely the world of ideas and scholarship which has moved on since the 19th century.
Society itself is, notoriously, changing very rapidly, and the possibility has to be considered that we are entering a period where the notions and the realities of political coercion, of production of wealth, and of cognition and legitimation, may need to be modified if they are to be useable in our actual social environment.
The research proceeds in the manner in which any theoretical piece of work proceeds — by experimenting with general ideas, working out their implications, and checking them against as wide a range of relevant concrete material as possible.
Apart from using secondary material from the area, the investigator is also working at a more specific level in two or three societies contrasted with the western developed industrial world: on the one hand, the Soviet Union and the East European socialist world and on the other, the Muslim world.
In both of these areas the investigator has carried out research previously, and consequently interpreting newly available material is not so difficult.

The research proposes to examine the broad social and epistemological implications of economic and political development in the Indonesian society of Bali.
The project has several aims.
Theoretically it seeks to examine the applicability of ‘post-structural’ and ‘post-Marxist’approaches in the social sciences to anthropological research.
More specifically, the research is intended to explore the potential relevance of the current interest in discourse, hegemony and agency to the critical debate about the nature and efficacy of development.
Miscommunication is widespread between peasants and outsiders, whether developers or government officials, and the research will focus on how processes of change are interpreted by the parties concerned.
This will involve a study of differences in kinds of knowledge and discursive practices.
As Balinese ethnography has often been invoked, with questionable accuracy, in recent theoretical argument, the research aims to contribute both to this discussion and to our more general understanding of the effects of development and of incorporation within a new nation state on indigenous populations.
The project falls into two parts.
The first will deal with the implications of central government attempts to ‘Indonesianise’ Bali through such means as administrative changes and television, as well as to examine the effects of local development programmes and the expanding tourist industry.
The second part will concentrate on how Balinese perceive and respond to these changes.
The research will examine the ways in which Balinese society and culture are being reconstituted and tradition reworked as Balinese come increasingly to be defined by external agents as part of an ignorant Indonesian proletariat rather than as a viable and successful peasant society.
This will require a consideration of the extent to which local knowledge is re-evaluated in the face of new ‘superior’ knowledge, and the ways in which Balinese interpret and restructure their understanding of themselves and their place in the world in daily life and more formal settings like theatre.
The study will be given specificity and historical depth by focusing on the community on which I have worked since 1970.
The proposed study is designed to link my earlier detailed ethnographic work on Balinese village society and on folk philosophy and semantics to current theoretical debates.
Recent work has drawn attention to the ways in which Western representations of other peoples — whether by, say, academics or developers — are acts of superior agency and involve a subtle form of hegemony.
Much of this argument is articulated in terms of differences in historically constituted discourses.
However discussion about ‘discourse’ is still highly theoretical and itself arguably a product of a Western intellectual tradition.
Further there has been, to date, no detailed critical ethnographic study of its potential relevance to actual field research.
The research is therefore intended to contribute to this theoretical debate and, in drawing on field work over a period of nearly twenty years, to consider critically the applicability of ideas like discourse to a particular ethnographic case.
The potential value of the research is not just theoretical, as it offers a new perspective from which to evaluate the innumerable problems which beset development programmes.
A better understanding of the implications and consequences of economic and political development policies is of immediate practical importance.

Micro-Hydro schemes are small water driven turbines which provide limited mechanical power for agricultural processing machinery and increasingly now also for electricity.
The development of this technology in Nepal has involved several local and outside agencies including the Intermediate Technology Development Group (UK).
Investment in this technology has expanded rapidly in the private sector; there are now over 350 installations and the number is growing.
This technology holds considerable promise for improving living conditions in a variety of ways.
The research aims to evaluate social and economic impacts of such schemes and in particular the relative distribution of costs and benefits, both quantitative and qualitative, within the communities affected.
It is intended to compare two schemes to identifycorresponding differences in typical experiences, problems and relations with and effects on the wider community.
Areas to be covered include the distribution of benefits between groups including women, poorer households, artisans and labourers, effects on work patterns and employment, and the potential demand for electricity for productive uses.
Research methods will be appropriate for gathering case-study material and will include interviews, observations and questionnaires of a quite limited nature.

Changing family and marriage patterns can reveal important insights into the contemporary social change.
The aim of the project is to document and interpret the complex relationship between gender roles, family structures and marriage ceremonial and the ways each has changed in the twentieth century.
One strategy for understanding the cultural divide between women ar.d men in the Arab Middle East is to focus, first or those people — such as women and men of urban elites or upper middle classes for whom changing domestic roles is an explicit issue; and, second, on a topic — such as marriage and marriage ceremonial where women and men are equally involved and their beliefs and activities may be treated together, not separately.
A major theme of the study will be the syncratic nature of the new wedding ceremonies and the ways in which local and western symbols and rituals are combined to express current ideas about marriage and the family.
Another theme is the relation between materialist values and the conspicuous consumption at weddings.
A third aspect of the study concerns the couple and their families' expectations of marriage and actual marriage patterns.
Finally, the study will consider the striking similarities between middle class weddings throughout the Arab World and the implications of their international cultural style.
The project follows a preliminary visit to Syria in 1988 and involves a total of seven months of anthropological fieldwork in the country.
The main method of research will be intensive, but loosely structured interviews, coupled with participation in domestic activities and marriage celebrations.

This project is part of a longitudinal study of two Turkish villages, begun in 1949-51, continued in 1971 and intermittently thereafter, and then by full-scale research in 1986.
The overall study has tow main objectives.
First to provide a unique, detailed, extendable and permanent archive of households over thirty-five years.
Second, to make possible a detailed account of specific changes in villages, over a 35-year period in which Turkey virtually accomplished the transition from an agrarian to an industrial society; population up by a factor of 2.5, GNP per capital up by a factor of around 3; more than 20 million people recruited into non-agricultural occupations.
This project has five aims: to extend and improve the data base by field visits, especially of urban immigrants; to correct and improve the existing archives; to devise ways of incorporating some qualitative detail from field notes; to devise ways of incorporating some qualitative detail from field notes; to devise ways of analysing and manipulating the archive to support a published account of the changes in the villages in terms of the idea of a published account of the changes in the villages in terms of the idea of a complex network of causal interactions; and finally to collect initial experimental data in planing marriages and on finding non-agricultural employment, with a view to collaboration in a future study of the social sources and social distribution of knowledge, using data from Pakistan, turkey and London, in collaboration with Dr Michael Fischer.

Over the next few decades community life-style in Britain is likely to become increasingly diverse.
Experimentation with ‘alternative’ ways of organising social affairs may be expected, thanks to increased leisure time, more home-based working and, above all, sheer ideological commitment.
When a local group, in self-conscious pursuit of a particular life-style, seeks to disengage, totally or partially, from mainstream society, conflict and misunderstanding may well result.
Maximum uncertainty in this regard will probably occur in instances where the disengaging group has no prior ethnic, racial or religious identity.
In the proposed research the potential contention and ambiguity in British social life which such matters entail are addressed through the study of self-consciously peaceful communities.
The methods of social anthropology are employed as research tools.
For the sake of realism, a non-rejectionist peaceful community, whose members engage in extensive economic and social dealings with mainstream society, will be chosen for the intensive field study.
Enquiry will focus on the social processes by which such a community, whose original members will have selected themselves, carves itself from the mainstream society, establishing demographic stability and a cultural identity.
Preliminary comparisons with ‘peaceful societies’ elsewhere in the world suggest that specific attention should be paid here to social techniques relating to
(i)
the equitable distribution of economic and political assets,
(ii)
the control of overt aggression,
(iii)
childrearing,
(iv)
the conceptualisation and representation of non-members, and
(v)
the promulgation of an emerging spiritual idology.

Musical intelligence, particularly as it is manifest in the creation and manipulation of musical symbols in improvised musics, is a little understood field.
Previous research with North Indian master drummers has suggested that computers may be able to throw some light on these processes.
The research aims to develop a computer-based tool that is capable of
(a)
eliciting the logic behind a complex improvised music, the rules for which are rarely (and only incompletely) verbalised by its performers;
(b)
transferring that knowledge and making it available in a symbolic form amenable to investigation;
(c)
constructing its own models of that knowledge independently of researchers' analytical assumptions and preconceptions.
Machine-learning and other advanced artificial intelligence techniques will be applied in interactive situations where musicians and computers will enter into direct dialogue.
The machine must continuously provide the musicians with examples of improvised drumming generated by the models it constructs so that its assumptions about the musical knowledge can be validated.
By exploring the deep structure of improvisatory cognitive strategies, it is hoped that a more general model of improvisation may be achieved that can be subsequently be tested on musics outside the original domain.

Research degrees undertaken in public sector institutions (largely the polytechnics and colleges of higher education) have been awarded by the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) since the mid-sixties.
Although the majority of MPhils and PhDs awarded (over 6,000 in total) have been in the areas of science and technology there has been a growing number of registrations and conferments in the social sciences.
At present there are around 700 registrations and have been over 600 conferments in this area.
The CNAA has kept detailed records of its candidates.
Using these records as a data base, this project seeks to explore key relationships with particular reference to submission and completion rates.
Thus the study will explore what relationship, if any, exists between entry qualifications and completion rates, whether the age of the candidate has any effect, the success rates of women compared to men and how important full-time study is as compared to the part-time mode.
The data also enable comparisons to be made with non-social science subjects and with university data.
The project is being undertaken by Professor David Dunkerley (Polytechnic South West — Plymouth) and Dr Jeffrey Weeks (CNAA).

The purpose of this research project is to obtain presently lacking information on the way of life, social structure and ideology of a Bantu-speaking people called Lungu who live around the southern end of Lake Tanganyika in East-Central Africa.
The principal investigator, Dr. R.G.Willis of Edinburgh University, intends to conduct most of his research through informal interviews and discussions with representatives of a wide spectrum of Lungu society, but concentrating initially on those persons of chiefly or royal status who are most likely to possess inherited knowledge about the indigenous political and social order.
Later the range of inquiries will be broadened to include those with specialist knowledge in indigenous medicine and religion, as well as commoners of both sexes.
Part of the research will focus on Lungu perceptions of, and interaction with, their natural environment.
In Zambia, where the bulk of the Lungu live, the results could have important implications for current official plans to develop the Sumbu national game park, which adjoins Lungu territory, as a major tourist attraction.

AIDS may constitute the major tragedy of Africa this century.
High mortality among adults in the prime of their productive and reproductive years will disrupt the economic and social development of the continent.
Social research is a prerequisite to cost effectiveness and economic planning in the African public health sector.
The history of health in Africa has shown often that medical research in isolation from its social context had little benefit for indigenous peoples.
This study will contribute important data which will assist social and medical scientist in their efforts to improve African health.
The long-term prediction is that the only defence against AIDS lies in effecting behavioural changes and anthropologists are being employed to study behavioural aspects.
This study will benefit anthropological findings by providing the broader context of the history of public health; the history of medical research in Africa; changes over time of African cultural perceptions of health and disease; and, the socio-economic history of AIDS in specific regions.
Investigation methods will include the creation and use of a research network; one year's fieldwork in southern Uganda and eastern Zaire; and use of secondary sources.
Research results will be published in a monograph.

This project is based on an anthropological and historical investigation of the Gurung peoples of central Nepal.
Long famous as recruits to the British Gurkha regiments, the Gurungs are facing the challenges of increasing population, soil erosion, rapid westernization and other pressures.
Their fate and that of other groups in the central Himalayas will directly affect the ecology of not only Nepal buy also India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Through the use of repeated censuses and land surveys, through photographs and films, and through an intensive long-term study lasting now since 1969, it will be possible to analyse some of the causes and consequences of what is happening in the mountainous eco-systems of the Himalayas.
This will make it possible to suggest ways in which the massive foreign aid efforts currently under way to prevent very serious and increasing food and fuel deficiencies be made more effective.
This will be a three-year-study, which will build on the material collected in four previous visits.
It will be co-operative work with several Gurungs who have experience in these fields.

The Mamprusi kingdom is one of a group of kingdoms now incorporated into Ghana, Togo and Bourguina Fasso.
These kingdoms are important to an understanding of the practical politics as well as the history of West Africa.
In the two decades since research was first carried out (1963-1965), Ghana has experienced radical socio-economic change, including oscillation between military and civilian rule in a series of coups d'etat c, gross inflation, and decay of the network of transport, communication and postal services.
In the Mamprusi region, literacy has increased and new forms of agriculture have been developed.
Two years of basic research led to a first description of Mamprusi court ritual and the system of succession.
Both are critical features of local political organisation.
Mamprusi kingship and chiefship circulate through distinct families of a large royal clan.
At the death of a king or major chief, a successor is chosen by commoner members of the king's court, from among several eligible contestants.
Thus high office remains accessible to a relatively wide range of royal kin and commoners wield significant power over the succession.
In 1985 the Mamprusi king died.
A successor will be chosen and installed during the period of proposed field-work.
Observation and participation in the installation ceremonies are to be the major tools of research and have been made possible by earlier field-work.
In addition, household census and demographic data will be collected.
Combined with data from earlier research new information should enable the impact of socio-economic change to be assessed.

Recent developments in reproductive medicine have made possible unprecedented procreative and parental arrangements.
A number of questions are opened up concerning rights, obligations and other kinship issues.
Current debate surrounding the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill provides evidence of widespread public concern over these matters, although the social and cultural implications of such developments have so far been little explored.
There are also new possibilities of another sort: for the redefinition of relationships.
While the number of individuals involved directly in assisted reproduction is small, ways of thinking about parenting and kinship are part of public culture at large.
However, there is a demonstrable lack of systematic information in this area.
Decisions may make reference to expectations and values concerning kin relationships that can only be assumed.
The project will investigate how information about such expectations and values could usefully be made available.
Four anthropologists, in consultation with a medical sociologist, will bring together a set of research approaches including: cultural analysis of recent parliamentary debate; ethnographic studies in a community and within households; the re-evaluation of anthropological theorising on kinship in plural societies.
This will be a short, exploratory enquiry.
Its principal aim is to address the contribution social anthropology can make to the public understanding of the impact of new reproductive technologies on the perception and definition of kin relationships.

Recent studies have challenged the idea that Andeans are ‘a people without history’.
Instead, the period after the Spanish Conquest is now viewed as time on an intense reworking of both Andean and Spanish traditions, which each culture experienced, and continues to experience, in different though interrelated ways.
This experience will explore the lesser studied Andean view of history.
It aims to present an autobiography of an Aymara-speaking peasant community, forged by its men, women and specialist historians, who, as social actors, construct their historical and cultural identity through oral traditions of song and spoken memory, as well as through their knowledge and practical use of written texts.
It will explore such issues as gender, status and performance in the social construction of history.
The results will be disseminated to academic and policy-making audiences in the English and Aymara-speaking worlds, and, eventually, to a wider non-literate audience of Andean people, in order to promote more serious discussions about ‘indigenous’ knowledge systems between policy makers and their subjects.
This research forms part of a wider study of the transformation in Andean religion and cosmology after the Conquest, by the same researchers.

Through a Catalan valley in the eastern Pyrenees runs the French/Spanish border unlike its route elsewhere along high peaks.
This valley, called Cerdanya in Catalan, Cerdagne in French and Cerdana in Castilian Spanish, provides exceptional opportunity for research on ‘ethnic’(Catalan) and ‘national’(French and Spanish) differences in food choices.
The ESRC funded a small study of several component parts: 7-day intake frequency records food preference questionnaires questionnaires on health perceptions participant observation by a social anthropologist discussion with elderly inhabitants re:change school menus survey of food shops and supermarkets links with health information.
Reception of the investigators was particularly friendly and has resulted in a great deal of data which is currently being processed.

Rural development and poverty programmes need sensitive grass-roots knowledge of self-help.
This project will develop ways of finding out about and of learning from non-governmental social support arrangements among villagers in China, the largest developing country in the world.
From sample surveys of some ten villages in different regions of China and at different levels of income this project will map out differences in the scope and ranges of resources which rural householders in China have had at their disposal in the last few years.
This should help indicate what households and under which conditions are most likely to be at risk or brought to a state of disaster in an emergency.
It should also indicate the best channels of aid to bolster self-help.
Through further interviews, observations and documentary research it will seek to establish householders' senses of entitlement and obligation in relation to other households and how these have changed from before Communist rule until the present day.
This involves gaining an idea of villagers' senses of their past and future fates, their senses of history, and their identities with others sharing or differences from those not sharing their fates.

While Irish America has attracted the attention of scholars in a wide variety of academic disciplines, anthropological work is remarkably little represented.
Moreover, while many American social scientists and historians have studied ‘the culture’ of Ireland and Irish-Americans, a reciprocal view has not been established: little, if any, work on Irish America has yet been published by social scientists based in Ireland, north or south.
Through ethnographic research set in Albany, New York, a team of anthropologists from Queen's University, Belfast, will investigate the range of beliefs and practices connected with Ireland that are current among Albany's Irish-American population; how Ireland and ‘being Irish’ in America are represented in everyday life, how they are distributed over the generations, and they may vary along socio-economic dimensions.
By virtue of their own experiences of working in a part of Ireland where cultural identity in highly problematic, there is promise that the team can contribute new insights about the way Irishness is perceived by ordinary Irish-Americans, and thus, ultimately, further an understanding of the relationship between these perceptions and the dynamics of economics, politics and social structure in the United States in regard to Ireland.

In addition to the 40 or so institutions in Scotland known to have collections of foreign ethnographic material, otherwise referred to as ‘material culture’ or ‘tribal art’, it is certain that there are a far greater number of such collections in private and public ownership which have not been made known.
This research programme will seek out these collections which come from Africa, Oceania, Indonesia, Asia, North, Central and South America.
A decline in the interest in ethnographic collections in the early to mid 20th century, particularly post Second World War, by both the public and academia led to substantial destruction and neglect of the material.
Since the 1980's there has been a renaissance of interest in ethnography.
Material culture presents an exciting opportunity for multicultural education, an invaluable and irreplaceable resource in art and design training, not least in cases where indigenous traditional skills have been lost, and the concern for the conservation of the world heritage, natural and cultural.
The aims of the programme: to establish the location of foreign ethnographic material in museums, universities, research institutes and private collections; to encourage and coordinate the recording of information about their collections by in-house museum staff; to record collections or organise recording by other specialists in cases where no professional staff are available to undertake the work; to establish a computerised database for the recorded information and to publish the findings of the survey.

There is a high incidence of miscarriage in early pregnancy.
This event commonly causes considerable distress to the woman involved.
This study investigates the needs of women at this time and examines the support which they receive from family and friends as well as that from health professionals in hospital and in the community.
Due to the sensitive nature of the subject, predominantly qualitative research techniques will be employed.
fifty women from two hospitals in Northern Ireland will be recruited to the study.
An initial structured interview will be followed by three semi-structured interviews over a six-month period.
The data collected will be used to prepare two information packages.
One package will address the common queries and concerns which many women have upon experiencing this event, and would be designed for women who have just had a miscarriage to read in their own time.
The second package would be designed for health care providers and would provide information as to women's emotional needs at this time and offer guidelines as to appropriate and sympathetic care.
Although studies of miscarriage from a broadly sociological perspective have been undertaken in Great Britain, none have had the specific focus of this study.
In addition, no study of this kind has been conducted in Northern Ireland which differs from the rest of the United Kingdom in a number of pertinent respects.

An investigation of the knowledge and uses of natural resources by the indigenous population of Temburong district, which preserves a rare example of accessible and yet otherwise relatively undisturbed tropical lowland rainforest.
The project will be particularly concerned with identifying different patterns of human interaction with the forest, and with the information which people have at their disposal when making resource allocation decisions, especially when those resources are scarce and when circumstances are changing.
Relatively little is known of the systematic knowledge which local peoples have of forest species and dynamics, and of the various patterns of traditional extraction and their consequences, yet it may provide vital information for those concerned with effective forestry, medicine, nutrition and plant product development.
It also provides a crucial area in which natural and social scientists can gain experience of cooperation, something urgently needed in a range of research priority fields related to global environmental change.
The research — which will be conducted under the auspices of the Universiti Brunei Darussalam and extends over a two-and -a-half year period — is expected to make a significant contribution to current debates about the exploitation and future of rainforest, and to attempts to place economic values on its component parts.

Of all the European institutions, it is the Parliament which would seem, amid controversy, to be poised to be a central democratic force in the construction of Europe.
The Europe in which we are to live will in part be shaped by the ideas, negotiations, cultural translations and mis-translations which people such as MEPs bring to Strasbourg and Brussels, or which they learn there, and in which they engage.
This study is to involve on-the-spot research in Strasbourg and Brussels, observing attempts actively to construct a European identity, history, culture and State.
Problems of cross-cultural translation have long been the terrain of anthropology.
This study will examine such problems, as and when they arise — and will do so through an ethnographic grasp of cultural differences and misunderstandings on topics that might range from the price of butter to question of minorities, language, drugs and terror.

The Laz are a distinctive group in north-eastern Turkey, Muslim like the overwhelming majority of Turkish citizens, but with strong cultural and linguistic affinities to peoples of adjacent regions of the Caucasus.
Earlier fieldwork in the area in the 1980s, also supported by ESRC, concentrated upon the socio-economic consequences of the introduction and expansion of the tea industry in recent decades.
It became clear during this work that there is some uncertainty and confusion about identity among many Laz themselves, and that representatives of these people elsewhere in Turkey can be very misleading.
The aim of the present project is to follow up the earlier research through concentration upon the cultural dimension.
Specific themes will include local models and metaphors of economic development as certain organizational shortcomings in the tea industry have their effects on income and the standard of living.
Gender relations will be highlighted as an area in which external images of the Laz may conceal a much more complex reality.
During the main period of fieldwork in 1992 it is hoped to collect a substantial body of ethnographic data on the Laz, which will lead to improved understanding of ethnic and cultural diversity in modern Turkey.
In addition to filling the significant gap which has arisen because this group falls in between the usual area specializations (Turkish/Anatolian and Caucasian) the project will also contribute to several fields of current debate within economic anthropology and ethnic studies.

The dwindling rain forests of West Africa have attracted international attention of late as many ‘First World’ countries are converted to the conservation cause.
Increasingly, these forest resources have become the focus of competing uses and understanding among the various interested parties — local communities, West African governments, international conservation and development agencies, private timber companies, etc.
This project aims to document and analyze the social processes and policy issues inherent in this situation, with particular emphasis on the ways in which conservation concerns are interpreted by African societies at all levels.
The researchers will undertake comparative case studies in Cameroon and Sierra Leone to examine popular attitudes and practices, as well as government and non-governmental organisation policies, relating to the exploitation and conservation of forest environments.
Intensive social ecological studies will particularly be undertaken in Cameroon's Korup National Park and the results compared with those already collected for the Gola Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone.

This project aims to develop an approach to the study of kinship terminologies which differs from that traditional within anthropology.
Rather than eliciting terms to fill in a theoretical grid of ‘kinship relations’ the starting point will be all the various means used to refer to social actors (linguists call this ‘social deixis’).
Hence, we shall be examining the distribution of pronouns, names and kin terms in free (unelicited) conversation.
Theoretical development will be based upon detailed materials obtained during fieldwork with the Mambila in Cameroon.
Further cross-cultural testing will follow using existing archives of machine readable transcripts.
The use of computers makes possible the analysis of relatively of naturally occurring conversation.
The project will use the results of such analysis to re-examine conventional theories of kinship terminologies.

The aim of this research project is to study modern food habits in an inner city area of Britain in the 1990s.
It will seek to understand how people are influenced by ideas of ‘healthy’ eating, and how such ideas are translated into practice.
How do people make sense of the variety of ideas coming to them about food?
And how does this differ by ethnicity, class, age and gender?
The researchers will therefore examine people's own notions of the relationship between food and health.
Questions will be asked about what are considered to be healthy foods and why, and whether definitions are changing.
The research thus seeks to accumulate new information on food choices in Britain and the processes — social, cultural, economic and political — which lead to such choices.
The study will be carried out in south-east London, and will focus on both micro and macro processes.
Interviews will be held with individuals, and there will be observation of selected households and their food practices.
In addition, an analysis of the wider food — shops, supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and fast-food outlets in the area — will be carried out by means of surveys.
Attention will also be paid to sources of ideas about food, such as the media, and health professionals.
It is expected that this study will demonstrate the importance of symbolisation, categorisation and social relationships in the way people construct ideas about food and health.
It is hoped that achieving greater understanding of people's ideas on food and health may prove of practical use in seeking to improve diet, as well as refining anthropological methodology and theory in the area of food and diet.

This research is concerned with the nature of the writing submitted to the Mass-Observation Archive by a range of ‘Observers’ in response to‘directives’periodically sent to them by the Archive.
In particular the researchers are interested in responses to a recent directive concerning the uses and meanings of literacy practices in the writers' lives.
Public attention to literacy often focusses on either ‘illiteracy’— the problems many adults encounter with the requirements of reading and writing in the modern world — or with professional — often literary — writing.
Between these two positions lies a range of literacy activity, such as personal autobiography, diaries, functional lists etc.
The writing submitted to the M-O Archive represents a particular genre, namely social commentary by committed and confident writers interested in making a contribution to history by providing evidence for future researchers of what ‘ordinary’ people at this time felt and wrote about contemporary social issues.
Researchers, however, have been troubled by questions of sampling and by the extent to which the writers' self-consciousness of their mission affects the data.
This project is concerned to explore these issues in greater depth as a contribution not only to reading the Archive but also to more general understanding of the everyday uses and meanings of literacy.
The researchers will read and analyse the written material and will follow up some responses with face-to-face interviews.
Findings are anticipated to have implications for teaching in schools and in adult literacy programmes for understanding of ‘popular ethnography’; and for social science interpretation of non-traditional collections such as this.

Based on both contemporary fieldwork and archival research, this study explores family life and kinship, marriage and celibacy strategies in north Puglia (south Italy) over the last 250 years.
Its focus is on changing patterns of repeat marriage between kin and close affines; on variations in neighbourhood organisation and the relationships between town and country; on changing reproductive ideologies and on the different ways in which the idiom of kinship is used to recruit political groups, to reinforce patronage systems and to determine succession to ecclesiastic and political office.
These changes are examined against a background of rural turbulence and a radical restructuring of the agrarian economy — the demise of pastoralism, the emergence of specialised latifundia cereal estates and rural syndicalism, more recently the widespread mechanisation of agriculture, land reform and labour migration.
In the context of a carefully chosen example, this study seeks both to further understanding of kinship and marriage systems in mediterranean Europe and to provide an exemplar of the combination of historical and anthropological research methods.
It also seeks to refine the ways in which computer techniques can be used to handle complex social processes (especially group and spacial dynamics) through time.

Women whose jobs are unskilled may actually be exercising complex skills to manage their everyday lives.
They have to plan ahead, allocate scarce time, decide between difficult alternatives and ‘contrive’, with limited resources, if they are to keep their households going.
Many researchers' accounts bear witness to these skills, but they are only mentioned in passing and seem to have been taken for granted.
The research aims to look more analytically at this ‘ordinary’ phenomenon, and to describe the social worlds of a number of West Midlands women with employment in domestic work.
It will use the methods and theories of social anthropology and of oral history, interviewing, observing, and also collecting women's own accounts.
In theoretical terms this is also a study of agency and of decision making in everyday life.

Various solutions to the problem of rising unemployment in Britain have been suggested, some of which depend in part on a change in the workforces' concept of work.
The project examines the values held in an industrial community in Central Scotland, particularly those relating to formal and informal work, and investigates whether these values have changed in response to the high level of unemployment there.
It asks how far the jobless attempt to maintain traditional roles, whether by legal or illegal means, and looks at the different sources of pressure and aid found in this village.
The researchers feel the community is fairly representative of working class culture in areas of heavy industry in Britain.
The research builds on an earlier SSRC funded project which produced the first detailed anthropological study of an industrial town in the Scottish lowlands.
The fieldworkers live in the community, joining in with and analysing its activities.
They are carrying out directed interviews there, and will collect time and money budgets.
Comparisons will be made with similar studies in other parts of the UK to find out the effects of particular local conditions.

Small towns in South India serve as economic and cultural centres for their surrounding rural hinterlands.
One important focal point is their Hindu temple.
Research in Tirunelveli District, examines the religious, economic and political roles of one such temple.
The temple itself is being studied from several perspectives.
The social identities of its priests, lay employees, and worshippers, are being determined.
Daily and festive worship in the temple is being observed.Most Hindus worship daily, in one of many possible ways.
The aim here is to discover who uses the temple, and in what circumstances.
The role of the temple in the wider community is also being investigated.
Sponsorship of temple festivals, and appointment as a Temple Trustee, may be important avenues of upward social mobility for persons from poor or low-caste backgrounds.
Moreover, the considerable incomes of many temples make them major employers, and important elements in the urban economy.
Both matters are being examined, through extensive use of temple records and accounts.
The research involves mainly participant observation in and around the temple, supplemented by archival work to determine whether the role and importance of the temple has changed over time.

This project seeks to assess the social and economic effects of recent smallholder tea and tobacco programmes in the Nyanza Province of western Kenya.
In tackling the serious problem of rural poverty, the Kenyan Government has advocated a Basic Needs approach to development and the research focuses on the ability of the schemes to improve standards of living for the rural poor.
Empirical work, using a combination of anthropological fieldwork and survey techniques investigates the effects of the schemes on rural production and incomes and on inter and intra-familial patterns of inequality.
With regard to the latter, it is apparent that the problem of poverty is not one that affects the household considered as a unit but may be differentially experienced by members of the family.
A major methodological contribution of the research will be to develop basic needs indicators for Kenya that are capable of taking into account the position of women and other dependent family members.

Although the impact of immigration on British society has been much debated, much less is known about the more geographically distant consequences of emigration.
The core of this project is a detailed investigation of the processes of social, economic and political change which are taking place in a few selected villages in the area from which the majority of Pakistani settlers in Britain originate.
The resulting account should be a useful source of reference for all those working with, or teaching about Pakistani settlers in Britain.
At a more analytical level, these micro-observations are being placed in a series of broader contexts.
These include a consideration of the history of the migratory process, the impact of returnees and migrant remittances, the consequences of various international aid projects, and of the way in which Pakistan's economy as a whole has become increasingly dependent on migrant remittances.
Over 10% of the country's GNP, and over 60% of its foreign exchange comes from this source — mainly now from workers in the Middle East.
All this will be used as a basis for a critical scrutiny of the efforts that have so far been made to stimulate rural development, and the changing fortunes of the rural population in this part of Pakistan.

Social anthropologists have largely been interested in explaining the incest taboo itself.
Most of the theoretical discussion assume that few, if any, breaches of the taboo occur.
For example the extrapolation from patterns of sexual behaviour among the great apes, which is the basis of ethological explanations of the incest taboo, depends on a comparison between the relative infrequency of mating among related animals and the human incest taboo.
Data on breaches of the taboo in small-scale communities are sparse and largely considered as cases of individual deviance.
However there are much more data on incest in western societies, where the sexual abuse of children is becoming recognised as a social problem.
Contrary to public stereotypes, this abuse is not perpetrated by strangers but by household members.
The study will be based mainly on cases referred to the Child Sexual Abuse Unit of the Department of Psychological Medicine in the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street but will collect other appropriate data.
Since households and families are not autonomous units, the study will also concern itself with wide social and economic structures and concepts.
The aim is to contribute to anthropological understanding of the incest taboo and also to be of practical use to the therapeutic team.

Subject Area:
Ageing and the elderly; Social interaction
The experience of ageing is influenced as much by social and psychological factors as by physical processes.
Ageing takes place in a context of formal and informal relationships: in the family, friendship network, club, waiting room and street.
Studies of old people's clubs, homes and retirement communities show the kinds of support provided by peers in a youth-oriented society.
But very little is known about age-mixed groupings — churches, political associations, bingo clubs and the experience of ageing within them.
In this project, age-relations are examined in the context of an urban, middleclass church community and a number of working class pensioners' clubs.
The object is to see how people perceive one another in age terms, and how far age is a factor in the allocation of roles and responsibilities and in the choice of friends.
Sex differences in ageing are examined.
A further comparison is made between pensioners' clubs which are organised by volunteers on behalf of charitable bodies and those which are run by old people for themselves.
In focusing upon informal relationships and the sources of sociability available to old people, the research has implications for the quality of life in old age.

The research is concerned with the tea industry in Sri Lanka and its characteristic outlook or ‘ethos’.
This is of particular significance in understanding how, as a plantation system, the industry developed from its beginnings in the coffee era of the mid-19th century and how, today, the industry faces a number of crucial choices as to its future survival as a nationalised undertaking.
The research focuses on both the organisation of individual estates and life in the planting community.
It also seeks to throw light on the role assumed by planters and the planting lobby in society at large.
Its main aim, however, is to explore the importance of a ‘planting ideology’ in the functioning of the estates and the industry as a whole.
In all plantation systems the question of labour is of vital interest to those who run the estates and the research is especially concerned with how the attitudes, beliefs and values held by planters lay behind the relationship between management and its work-force as it developed over time.
The methods of research adopted in this project combine those characteristics of social anthropology and history: they include the micro-level study of two contrasting estates, archival research, the detailed investigation of the records kept in estate offices, a series of informal interviews with former European planters and their wives now living in the UK, and discussions and interviews with informants associated at all levels with the industry in Sri Lanka.

The impact and effectiveness of aid is a continuing issue in development studies.
Studies of aid projects have tended to focus on the results of such projects and have lacked detailed analysis of what preceded the projects or the political and bureaucratic factors which have led to a project being implemented or abandoned.
Building on the investigator's previous experience of fishing communities in Sri Lanka, this research aims to examine an aid project which involves the introduction of radically new fishing craft into ‘traditional’ Sinhalese fishing communities.
Research focuses on four main areas:—
1 the attitudes of the fishermen themselves towards these new craft,
2 the attitudes and experience of the British technical experts involved in this project,
3 the political content in Sri Lanka which determines whether or not such an aid scheme is pursued and how it is implemented,
4 the ways in which the British aid-giving bodies view and assess the aid project.
Whether or not this pilot study leads on to a larger project depends upon first, whether or not the aid project goes ahead, and second, whether or not the pilot study indicates that a more ambitious study is feasible.

Although most of us can recognize without difficulty the importance that the emotions play in our lives, the subject has been given little systematic attention by the disciplines most concerned with furthering understanding of human behaviour.
The reasons for this neglect are many and complex, in the case of social anthropology in particular it is rooted deep in the history of the discipline.
In recent years, however, the situation has been changing significantly, and psychologists have made important advances.
Since many of their findings have obvious cross-cultural implications, there is a clear challenge here to anthropologists.
The present study then is concerned to explore the role of the emotions or affect in the social life of the Tolai of Papua New Guinea, a group well-known in the ethnographic literature with whom the researcher has himself worked earlier.
Since one of the points at issue is the question of universality, the research will focus on the language of the emotions and the range of terms available in the vernacular to express them.
The meaning of these terms will then have to be investigated with reference to the contexts in which they are experienced as well as to the relationships of the parties involved.
The assumption is that different societies manage the emotions in different ways; another aim of the research therefore is to discover what rules govern the display of the emotions and how this cultural control is achieved.

European nations have always been, in one way and another, multi-lingual and multi-cultural, and despite policies which have promoted, and sometimes imposed, a common, standard tongue for all citizens, multilingualism remains a feature characteristic of European states.
In many countries, too, since the Second World War, the linguistic and cultural scene has been further diversified with the arrival of immigrants from outside Europe, with languages and cultures substantially different from those of the host society.
But because of the way nation states have been formed, and in the case of migrant workers, because of the way in which the labour market works, languages and their speakers are not usually of equal status, power and authority.
What are the consequences of this linguistic inequality, and how specifically does it differ from, or contribute to, inequality of other kinds?
These are theoretical and practical questions of considerable importance as discussion over the last 15 years has shown.
This study, which derives from previous field research on migrants in Europe, compares British and French experience over some 200 years.
Drawing on the work of anthropologists, linguists and historians, it seeks to provide a theoretical framework for an understanding of multi-lingualism and multi-culturalism, and through the Franco-British comparison to suggest guidelines for assessing the implications of multi-lingualism for contemporary social and cultural policy.

This project completes the analysis and writing up of material collected in an ESRC financed social anthropological study of the effects of women's entry into waged employment in the city of Calcutta, India which was carried out in 1981-82.
The aim is to publish a book from these findings.
The original study, which covered 114 households in depth, examined the nature of the local labour market, the sexual division of labour within households, the financial contribution made by women, the authority structure within families and the changes in family and kinship patterns brought about by increasing involvement in the urban wage economy.
The substance of the book is a case study of the particular ways in which women's employment is accommodated within the household and family or in which it brings about changes of various kinds, but its further aim is to explore the structural similarities between the experiences of industrialised India and Western Europe in respect of changing family forms and the position of women.

Turkey's founder, Ataturk, guided her from 1923 to 1938 through a political and social revolution.
Yet in 1950 four fifths of Turkey's 20 million people still lived in villages, and practiced agriculture in family enterprises.
By the nineteen eighties, the population has reached 50 million, industrial output has increased some twelve fold, services eight fold, and average income per head three fold.
To supply the necessary manpower, some twenty million people have had to migrate and to learn thousands of new skills, from simple literacy, to genetic engineering or industrial management, working outside their homes.
Patterns of social relations, flows of information and ideas have changed drastically; and unevenly.
The researcher studied intensively two villages near Kayseri from 1949-1952, and has kept in touch since.
These village households have sent migrants all over Turkey and abroad; they now enjoy very different levels and sources of income.
With Turkish collaborators, he plans to interview up to 400 village and migrant households, to collect quantifiable personal histories, and also to gather informal data through his established contacts.
He aims to bequeath a detailed historical and ethnographic account of an industrial revolution and to analyse the intricate network of causal connections involved, relating the many changes which affect villagers and migrants to national and international factors and processes.
He intends such an analysis to contribute to theory.

Japanese language has a number of speech forms which express status differences.
These ‘speech levels’ are also used as a polite framework to communicate further subtleties of meaning.
A full understanding of communication depends, first, on a clear understanding of the principles of hierarchy which underlie Japanese notions of status, and secondly, on a knowledge of the other ways in which speech levels may be used.
The broad aim of this research project is to gain a deeper understanding of these two factors.
The investigation will be carried out, with the help of two Japanese research assistants, by means of interviews and observation in various situations in Japanese communities, by reading Japanese books on the subject, and by comparing the Japanese case with general theories about language and its social implications.
The project is based on a conviction that a better understanding of speech levels and hierarchy will make an important contribution to the general understanding of Japanese society, and ultimately help Westerners to look beyond the veneer of politeness in dealing effectively with their Japanese counter-parts.

The revival of nationalist claims within European states by ethnic groups is one of the most important changes in European politics in recent decades.
The effects of Basque nationalism have threatened to destabilise the Spanish state; anti-nationalists living in the northern Spanish province of Navarra try to limit its spread by promoting regionalism — they campaign for the autonomy of Navarra while remaining faithful to their patria, Spain.
The research aims to provide: 1) the first ever intensive study of the effects of the confrontation from the early 1970s to the present day; 2) an ethnographic study of one Navarran village, and of its political and economic connections with Pamplona, the Navarran capital.
An important, supplementary topics of study are: 1) the effects of Spain's entry into the EEC, especially the effect of entry on one village, how villagers perceive the advantages and disadvantages of entry, and how they take advantage of its benefits; 2) the development of Carlism within Navarre as an example of the relations between power, language, and ritual in a modern European setting, from 1939 to today.
Historical research will be gleaned from newspaper reports, town-hall records and intensive interviews with relevant personalities.
All research into present day matters will be by participant-observation while living in a Navarran village throughout the calendar year 1986.

The project will examine the religious activities of women over an area of Northern Greece.
The aim is to gather material on everyday activities (at home, in churches and graveyards) but also on the more exceptional activities which take women out of their normal routines and maybe away from their communities (ie pilgrimages and forms of the religious life).
Major religious traditions consist of a relatively fixed and formal component — the texts, doctrines and rites — and the more mutable participation and commitment of groups of people.
The way formal religion is incorporated into a way of life is not constant and must relate to the social experience particular to certain groups and even to individuals.
The examination of those processes whereby religious concepts and symbols are incorporated into social negotiations of all kinds is intended to open the way for a fuller understanding of issues of power and identity.

Members of the Department of Social Anthropology and the Audio-Visual Aids Unit Cambridge are collaborating to make the first experimental videodisc at Cambridge University.
A videodisc can hold very large amounts of pictorial, textual and sound material, for instance 54,000 still images on one side of a disc.
Linked to a micro-computer it can be accessed very fast and used interactively.
The investigators will explore some of its possible applications.
As an archival medium the videodisc is likely to be unsurpassed both for compactness and durability, as well as cost.
The research possibilities are also very large.
For instance, within anthropology, the videodisc will be a powerful tool in the analysis of art, ritual dance, language.
In historical research, the publication and analysis of very large databases can be envisaged.
The videodisc will also have considerable potential in teaching at both University and School levels.
In association with Museums and galleries, it will make it possible to mount new kinds of displays and to make the usually unseen collections accessible.

This comparative review of contemporary African states and societies is concerned with the wordly dimensions of Islam — in society, the economy and the state.
While observers agree that Islam continues to spread rapidly throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, there is less agreement as to the likely social and political consequences.
The first section of the study examines the present situation of traditional (sufi) Islam.
Sufism in today's Africa, with its saint worship and magical practices, has been presented as doomed in the path of modernisation: such an assessment is to be seriously questioned here.
While Muslim social activity has a spontaneous dynamism with a proliferation of private groups and associations, African states are most concerned to exercise political authority over their Muslim communities.
The second section of this study is thus to review the possible relations between Islam and the bureaucratic state.
Three major Islamic options are to be considered — the maintenance of Muslim tradition, or the pursuit of modernisation, or the messianic or indeed the modern fundamentalist path of revolution.
This four-year project is to be jointly co-ordinated by the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and the University of Bordeaux (co-directors, Dr D B Cruise O'Brien and Dr C Coulon) with a multi-disciplinary team of nine scholars: four British and five French.

The relation in Lowland Amerindian societies between power, knowledge, scarce resources and social action is increasingly recognized as a key theoretical area for debate; and for many investigators who specialize in South American studies they see a critical need for the elaboration of a theory of power (or various of them) that would make understandable the non-centralized authority structures of Tropical South America.
This research explores ways of moving out of the Western paradigm of thinking about ‘the political’ and the relationship of the political to the economic.
The purpose of the project is to spell out the explicit philosophy of power, equality, and materiality expressed by the Piaroa in cosmology, shamanic exegesis of it, and in daily rhetoric, to relate this philosophy to everyday practice, and to define in which ways the Piaroa rhetoric of equality and individualism is to be taken seriously as a fact of daily life.

The garment industry has traditionally provided entrepreneurial opportunities for incoming immigrants, and this is reflected in the wide spectrum of ethnic groups currently involved in it.
The research will investigate patterns of cross-ethnic interaction in the Manchester fashion trade, the uses of various rhetorical conventions such as joking and mutual stereotyping, and the ethnic basis of competition in the industry for prized values and resources.
The research will thus deviate from the common run of ‘community’ studies which have hitherto been the main focus of anthropological research on ethnic minorities in Britain.
Both fieldwork and survey techniques will be employed to investigate entrepreneurial strategies, the emergence of immigrant ‘enclave economies’, and the creation of an immigrant ‘culture of entrepreneurship’.
It is hypothesized that ethnic interaction in the market place differs from interaction in other work and bureaucratic contexts.
Immigrant entrepreneurs have a greater measure of autonomy, and patterns of dominance are highly fluid.
Successful business transactions hinge on the overcoming of cultural barriers to communication, with the consequent emergence of a localised negotiated order, not so clearly dominated by the host society and its culture.
The project follows an earlier major study of Pakistanis in Manchester conducted by the project director.

The research will contribute to the debate about agricultural change in Europe through a field-work study of the economic, cultural and political dimensions of the development of one estate.
In central Italy the once dominant share-cropping system has collapsed and in its place has emerged a complicated mixture of part-time farmers producing largely for home-consumption, family farmers and capitalist enterprises producing for the market.
This research will explore the changing relationship between these three sectors through a study of one technologically advanced company.
Villa Banfi is an American firm which bought an abandoned estate in an area famous for its wine production, and through massive investment developed it into one of the largest single enterprises of its kind in Europe.
Can the neighbouring family producers compete with this new technology?
Can the large firm in agriculture compete with the proverbial flexibility, in work and income, of the family farmer?
What employment patterns emerge?
If the majority of the employees are seasonal workers, what happens to the rest of local agriculture, to family organisation and to conceptions of work with a shift towards part-time farming and wage labour employment?
Finally this anthropological study will investigate political reactions to this recent development, especially that of the Communist Party which is locally dominant.

This study is designed to provide a means of testing, refining, and developing theories about football hooliganism on the basis of empirical data that are being collected by the techniques of social anthropology.
The fieldworker, Gary Armstrong, already well known to many core fans prior to the formal start of this research, is collecting data not only on minor and major incidents of violence by fans, but also and as importantly, on the more frequent occasions when the same young men gather simply to enjoy football or one another 's company.
The study appears fortunately timed since it has covered a period of relatively intense local violence between the rival supporters of Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday.
The consequent local backlash, combined with tighter control of hooliganism generally, seems likely to make the fans much more cautious in the future about gathering together, and it should be possible, therefore, to study the results, unintended as well as intended, of tighter policing.
A major aim of the study is to avoid distorting results by selecting out particular fans as informants.
Instead information is being collected on the background and activities of all the members of a number of the quasi-groups who make up the core fans.

The problem that this project investigates can be divided into two parts: procedural and substantive.
Procedurally, it tests in the field a set of methodological propositions that suggest ways by which a mode of analysis that concentrates upon the social actors' constructions of reality might be applied to the study of complex societies.
Substantively, this research will contribute toward the understanding of the relationship between bureaucracies and their clients.
It focuses specifically upon the politics of the distribution of state grants, loans and subsidies in the Swedish commercial fishing industry.
It examines the bureaucrat-fisherman relationship in the context of the allocation of resources from government to local investment in fishing activity, a critical variable in the capitalisation of fishing enterprises and therefore in the maintenance of employment in rural areas.
Research is being carried out through 16 months' fieldwork, using the standard anthropological techniques of participant observation and intensive interviewing, in four sample fishing communities in the Gothenburg area, and in the offices of fishermen's organisations and government bureaux in Gothenburg.

This study investigates the social influences upon economic behaviour in a mixed Protestant and Catholic fishing village in County Down.
The religious identity of the fisherman is of particular interest in the way that this relates to their membership of fishermen's organisations and the uses that are made of the system of state supports to the fishing industry in the Province.
The project attempts to account for the variety of economic strategies fishermen have adopted through an examination of their behaviour as entrepreneurs, employers and employees.
A wider aim is to contribute towards an understanding of the economic and social organisation of commercial sea fishing in Northern Ireland, its present structure and future prospects.
By taking a ‘bottom up’ approach its findings are intended to complement the ‘top down’approach taken by a recent, much more formalistic economic survey of the industry that was sponsored by the EEC.
The principal method of investigation is residential fieldwork, using standard anthropological techniques, which affords the opportunity of simultaneously conducting several continuing series of interviews with selected individuals and panels of informants.

Many studies of unemployment have been concerned to identify the various factors (age, health, skill, social class, race, sex, etc) which influence the length of time spent unemployed, the frequency of spells of unemployment and the categories of people who suffer disproportionately from job loss.
The present research is designed to investigate the effects of a somewhat different range of factors (for example, net income, religious/ethnic affiliation, family and social networks, perceived level of local unemployment, experience of previous unemployment, types of activities engaged in, including activity in the black economy, attitudes to work, etc) on the experience of, and ability to manage and cope with, a period of unemployment.
The research concentrates on 40 Protestant and Catholic, skilled and semi-skilled, married men in two age groups (25-35 and 40-50) who will be ‘followed’ from the start of their spell of unemployment for a period of up to 17 months (or until they regain paid work), interviews being conducted at approximately 5 month intervals.
The research also uses other methodological approaches including participant observation.
An assumption of the research is that the experience of unemployed people is, to one degree or another, shaped by the attitudes and opinions of the working population.
A major objective of the research therefore is to determine the extent, quality and accuracy of the knowledge of a similar sample of 40 presently employed men on a range of issues concerning unemployment, unemployed people, welfare benefits, work, etc.

In addition to its role in imparting particular knowledge and skills, education is often presented as a way of developing children's thinking skills generally.
Advocates of liberal education and especially of its science component argue plausibly for its effect on pupils' ability to think logically, but the evidence for such an effect is not substantial.
Piaget described 10 ‘formal operational schemata’ or reasoning patterns underlying all scientific thought.
Present science teaching generally assumes implicitly that pupils possess the reasoning patterns.
In fact, only about 15% of 14 year-olds do.
This project is aimed at average pupils, who at present fail to master our traditional secondary science courses.
The project proposes to find out how far the thinking of these pupils can be advanced, over a period of two years, to give them access to concepts which hitherto they would not have had.
The investigators propose to
(a)
train the pupils in a language which assists the development of these reasoning patterns;
(b)
select science contexts which require these reasoning patterns;
(c)
assist the pupils to recognise what reasoning pattern
(s)
eachcontext requires and how to apply them.
(i)
find out what success our training has produced both on tests of understanding and of achievement;
(ii)
endeavour to assess the cost and the generalisability of the training procedures developed;
(iii)
at least begin the process of inservice training required to bring these (successful) methods into the professional repertoire of the science teacher.

The project was designed to develop and evaluate a radically new French language course and teaching method for university and polytechnic students in final honours, based on an adaptation of the ‘communicative’ methodology.
The central objective of that method is to exploit research into second language learning, and to equip students with a practical mastery of speaking, listening, reading and writing skills, whilst maintaining and extending the intellectual demands on the learner.
The assumption was also that the ability to communicate confidently and accurately, with a fuller understanding of the processes of communication, equips graduates better for the demands of social and professional life than traditional university teaching methods in language.
The project was the first publicly funded research investigation and evaluation of the linguistic and educational aspects of the university language curriculum in UK French studies.
The issues examined include the role of video in the learning process, communicative grammar (the grammar of combined sentences), and the communicative method.
The course was pilot-tested in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
It was evaluated by the Edinburgh University Gordon Thompson Unit, with total success, and published as a student course book and tutor's guide, with two videotape material cassettes.
The project arose from a pilot study carried out in 1982-3 with the support of the Nuffield Foundation and was one of two parallel projects sponsored by the Scottish Universities French Language Research Association,(the other, Lyon a la une being unfunded).

Earlier research produced a comprehensive description of medical student selection in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the 1980s.
In this current project, two studies are being carried out which should provide the next stage for following up the researchers' first cohort of 1981 entrants.
The studies should also provide a second investigation of applicants (for 1986 entry) who will subsequently form a further cohort of entrants, and will become part of a series of quinquennial surveys of medical school applicants, entrants, graduates and practising doctors.
Thus it should be possible to monitor changes in admission practices, to understand the mechanisms of change during medical education and beyond, and to provide long-term validation data for the process of selection itself.

The growth of Information Technology (IT) in education has implications for and is consequent on teacher education.
The level of penetration of IT applications in educational practice and the level of familiarity with IT amongst teachers will have a bearing on the uptake of IT in the wider context of post-school experience.
This research will consider the factors which contribute to effective pre-service and in-service teacher education in the field of information technology.
Conventional evaluation techniques will be applied to existing courses and these will be analysed to identify the IT content.
It is hoped that courses tailored to particular IT topics will be available as both a control and a development provision.
The selected target populations include pre-service BEd and PGCE students, in-service MEd, teachers on short-term self-study Fellowships and teachers attending conventional 2, 3 and 5 day short-courses.

Individuals' evaluations of how good they are at something are generally made in relation to how good others are at the same thing.
How individuals view themselves depends in part on whom they compare themselves with.
Such comparisons may involve other individuals or may be between one group and another.
These comparisons and evaluations are also made by children.
This is well recognized by parents who are invariably concerned that their children make friends with the ‘right group’ of people.
However, little is known about how or when children begin to use information about others to compare and evaluate themselves.
The present research addresses this.
In particular, it examines when children begin to compare with others not only as individuals but also as members of groups.
Children aged 3 to 9 will take part in a series of games; their responses to questions on these games will be analyzed to ascertain whether comparisons were made and affected their self-evaluations.
The findings will show at what ages comparisons with others influence children's views of themselves.
Knowing when particular comparisons--with individuals and between groups--exert an impact on children's self-evaluations will help parents and teachers to guide children towards appropriate comparisons for maximizing their well-being.

The relationship between the state and private education has once again become a focus of political attention.
This research is exploring this relationship via a detailed examination of the origins, operation and effects of the Assisted Places Scheme, introduced by the Conservative government in 1981 to provide places in certain independent schools ‘for academically able children whose parents cannot otherwise afford the full tuition fees’.
The Scheme and the debates about it highlight some of the long-standing tensions in English educational policy.
Using both national data and more detailed information on the operation of the Scheme in particular local areas, the study seeks to assess the costs and benefits of the Scheme in relation to the claims made by its advocates and critics during the controversy surrounding its introduction.
The present research supplements that carried out from 1982-85 at King's College London, which concentrated on the implementation of the Scheme in areas with large independent day schools.
In its final year, the project will pay particular attention to the response to the Scheme in the traditional boarding school sector and to the differential impact of the Scheme in areas with selective and non-selective forms of state education.

This project arises out of an earlier ESRC-funded study in England and France which revealed unexpected and significant differences in teachers' approach to their classroom practice in the two countries.
In this country, it is often assumed that teachers are a law unto themselves once they are inside the classroom and that it is their professional training and sense of professional responsibility that are the chief influences on their practice.
In other countries, such as France, where central government has more extensive authority over teachers, the opposite assumption tends to be made that teachers will conform to national policies and regulations in their practice.
In fact, relatively little is known about the various influences on teachers' classroom practice and the extent to which these are similar in different countries.
Hence the need for research in this area.
The research design distinguishes between teachers' perceptions of their formal obligations and constraints, both within the institution and more broadly within the education system, their self-imposed ‘moral’ responsibility and the extent to which they feel free to make their own decisions as autonomous professionals.
Interviews with teachers combined with observation of their work in classrooms will be used to explore differences in all three of these aspects as they affect both professional attitudes and practice in the two countries.
The overall aim of the study is to examine how teachers' perspectives are influenced by particular organisational structures and national traditions and in so doing, provide insight into the process of organisational reform and curriculum innovation.

This project examines how primary school staffs work productively together.
At a time when HMI and others are prescribing more consultative and collaborative ways of working in primary schools it is appropriate that some research takes place into the kinds of social and communication skills required of teachers.
However, since in many primary schools ‘other adults’ may also play significant parts, focus will extend to non-teaching staff (ie caretakers, clerical assistants, ancillaries).
It is anticipated that the research will consider such issues as staff relationships, leadership roles, group behaviour and actions and aspects of motivation.
It is hoped that the research will serve to enhance our understanding of formal and informal processes which facilitate primary school curriculum development and management.
The research will take the form of participant observation with all three of us acting as part-time teachers in the schools.
These schools will be selected to cover a range of criteria, but all will offer positive models of inter-adult practice.
We found the key to good working relationships among the adults was to be found in the notion of school cultures.
Schools in which the adults worked productively together had a ‘culture of collaboration’.
Heads played a crucial part in developing such a culture, but it was sustained by other leaders (especially deputies) and by active participation of staff members.
Schools with collaborative cultures were friendly and secure places in which to work, but they were not cosy; differences between members were openly tackled and though they were often resolved through compromise, this was not always an easy process.
Collaborative schools coped well with change, balancing it with the preservation of continuity, especially of values.

Several of the earliest proponents of intelligence testing assumed that such tests would show substantial differences in intelligence between races.
The advent of large-scale IQ testing in the United States confirmed their darkest suspicions, for blacks and immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe scored consistently lower than the white, indigenous majority.
Britain also, of course, now has sizeable ethnic minorities and there has been considerable concern about their educational achievement, resulting in the setting up of a government committee of inquiry.
The general plan of this research is to examine patterns of school attainment and test scores within ethnic minorities and within the indigenous majority and, using multivariate and stepwise regression analyses to see to what extent social, economic, individual and educational factors contribute to the differences in these scores.
It is also possible to match children from ethnic minorities with selected indigenous children to see how far appropriate matching and the variables used reduce average group differences.
The data used in these analyses are provided from two longitudinal British surveys of all children born in a particular week of 1958 and 1970.

The Centre for Educational Sociology at Edinburgh University holds data from the Scottish school leavers surveys, which have been conducted since 1962, and biennially since 1977.
The surveys of 1977 and 1981 covered very large samples and can be used to make reliable statements not only about Scottish secondary education as a whole but also about each of the 450 secondary schools in Scotland.
The data cover several aspects of family background and (in some cases) the ability of pupils on entering secondary schools; pupils' experiences at school, including the curriculum, methods of teaching and learning, and relationships between teachers and pupils; and several outcomes of schooling, including qualifications, attitudes, truancy and further education or employment after school.
The principal part of this programme uses these data to provide a unique picture of the range of differences among schools in an entire secondary school system.
The measures of family background and ability can then be used to control the different intakes to schools and thus to estimate differences in the effectiveness of schools with respect to the outcome measures listed above.
The programme tests the stability of school effects over time, and considers to what extent they are related to measured differences in processes within schools or resource inputs to schools.
The second part of the programme uses the data to analyse changes in the performance of secondary schools over time, with special attention to the effects of comprehensive reorganisation and of rising youth unemployment.

It has been observed that pupils' attitudes to computers are significantly influenced by use of a home-computer and experience of computer assisted learning (CAL) at school.
It is supposed that pupils' attitudes should also be affected by lesson activities and the classroom environment they experience during a course of computer education.
The project will test this hypothesis using data collected from teachers and from pupils.
A checklist completed by teachers will give a measure of the use of over two hundred activities in computer education lessons.
Pupils' attitudes to computers will be assessed by a questionnaire developed by the researcher; perception of the classroom environment will be assessed by means of ten scales used in other classroom research studies.
Pupils will also be asked about the nature and frequency of their use of a home-computer and their experience of CAL.
Analysis of teachers' responses will seek groupings of activities according to a common pattern of use.
It may be possible to identify two or more teaching styles based on different frequencies of use of the activity groups.
Teaching style or the use of certain lesson activities will be tested against pupils' attitudes and classroom environment scores.
Significant correlations between lesson activities and pupils' perceptions might be applied in teacher training and curriculum development programmes.

The project investigates the relationship between first language learning and foreign language learning ability (foreign language aptitude).
It continues the work of the Bristol Language project, supervised by Dr Gordon Wells, and follows up the foreign language school-based progress of the children whose first language developmental data were gathered by the Bristol team in the early 1970s.
The study aims to explore the nature and patterning of the variation in foreign language achievement in secondary schools as it relates to earlier first language development.
Ultimately, it is hoped that the research will clarify how knowledge of the capacities of the foreign language learner can foster more efficient language teaching.

Large numbers of microcomputers are currently being introduced into primary schools, and as yet there is little knowledge of how these machines are being used in the classroom, or how the teachers themselves view the use of this technology in primary education.
This research involves a systematic examination of the critical factors involved in introducing information technology into schools.
The research supported by the ESRC, ILEA and Research Machines Ltd is investigating the uptake and usage of microcomputers in a select number of ILEA primary schools.
These schools have been using microcomputers for three years and have had substantial teacher training, provision of materials and other support services from the ILEA.
The aims are to find out how the teachers are using the micros, what problems they have, what features of the technology are important and how can an LEA best support them.
The investigation involves:—
(a)
an analysis of Teachers' reports on their use of IT in the classroom
(b)
An initial questionnaire collected from the 22 ILEA schools
and
(c)
Classroom observations and teacher interviews.
A report will include recommendations for the training of teachers in the use and management of microcomputers in primary schools, and establish a framework for further research in this area, focussing particularly on in-service training.

Previous research projects financed by the ESRC at Chelsea College, Concepts in Secondary Mathematics and Science (CSMS), and Strategies and Errors in Secondary Mathematics (SESM) have identified some of the mathematical misconceptions possessed by children.
The proposed research is designed to provide information on young children's ability to make the transition from the concrete-based mathematics of the primary school to the type of more formal mathematics which is common in the secondary school.
It is hypothesised that many children do not assimilate the link between the pre-requisite experiences and the generalisation which follows, as for example in the finding of the area of a rectangle by counting squares and the presentation of a formula which generalises the results.
The participation of primary and middle school teachers forms a major part of the methodology.
It is intended that a teacher choose and teach a topic which leads up to formal rule or formula.
The researchers discuss and monitor the teaching and are present during those lessons when the formalisation is expected to take place.
Six children in each class are interviewed on four occasions, before the teaching of the topic, immediately before and after the formalisation lesson
(s)
and six months later, to discover the degree of restructuring of their knowledge.
The data were comprised of 1600 interviews and observations of lessons in 25 classrooms.

The broad aim of education for adults should be to provide a flexible service that is responsive to changing social and economic patterns and to the changing needs of individuals and communities.
In spite of widespread attempts in recent years to make learning opportunities more accessible to adults from all sections of society and the development of special programmes tailored to the needs of specific groups, there are still many social groups which, for a variety of reasons, do not readily participate in post school educational activities.
The principal aim of the research is to examine the experiences and perceptions of adult education providers and consumers and identify effective ways of contacting, consulting and recruiting groups which generally fall into the non participant category.
The investigation will involve a search of existing documentary evidence, surveys, and interviews with a cross section of providers and adult students in different localities.
The outcome will be a detailed report to assist providers in increasing the participation of different socio-economic groups in learning activities.

This project investigates a major application of standardised testing in primary schools: to identify children who may be in need of special attention or teaching.
Previous work funded by the ESRC at the Institute of Education showed that in the last five years screening techniques have been used increasingly to identify children for special educational provision.
However, the relative efficiency of different screening programmes and the deployment of different kinds of provision following on from screening have not been investigated.
The 1981 Special Education Act, which came into force in early 1983, requires LEAs to identify and provide for all those pupils who have special educational needs.
This, combined with the cuts in remedial provision taking place in LEAs and the current re-thinking of the nature of remedial teaching, makes an investigation into both screening and provision for special educational needs within the classroom important.
The investigation has three phases: a survey of all Local Education Authorities by mail questionnaire will be followed by detailed interviews with senior staff in a small sample of LEAs.
Case studies of screening and follow up provision will then be conducted in a range of schools in the same LEAs.

As self-governing bodies, local education authorities are, by and large, free to decide for themselves the amount of money they will spend on education.
The main items of expenditure are teacher salaries, other staff costs, expenditure on school buildings and expenditure on equipment.
There is a considerable degree of variation between authorities in terms of their expenditure in each of these areas, and of the levels of provision achieved.
This project first develops a methodology to enable the annually-published data on levels of expenditure and provision to be used, freed from distortion by inflation and changed definitions.
The data are then being used to display trends in the variations between authorities over the period 1975/76 to 1983/84.
The authorities are being divided by class (counties etc) and by sector (primary etc) as well as by category of expenditure.
A selection is being made of these authorities which are revealed to have diverged upwards or downwards by a statistically significant amount from the others in their class and a detailed investigation made in the authorities concerned to discover the causes.
The benefits of this research are likely to include
(a)
to assess the degree of convergence or divergence of input provision between and within classes of education authorities over the period 1975-84;
(b)
to indentify the local pressures that interact with central resource allocations to produce the observed levels of provision;
(c)
to draw out implications for equity of provision on a national scale and for the central-local relationship.

The purpose of the study is to relate secondary school teachers' perceptions of the tasks and conditions of teaching to identities and non-identities in the working practices and environments of different cultures and educational systems.
The aim in so doing is to evaluate the effects on secondary teachers of changes in educational policies, and to spell out the implications of those policies for professional recruitment, training and status in each of the countries studied.
A theoretical aim is to test out the generalisability of theories of job satisfaction among teachers which have been developed on a unicultural basis, often from samples of people in many different occupations.
The research represents the second stage of cross-national collaborative studies undertaken by colleagues working in education in a number of countries.
The three countries directly involved are those which have already used a common survey instrument to derive data on teachers' perceptions of their work.
This is a questionnaire which incorporates aspects of working conditions, roles and responsibilities, classroom practices and demographic information.
The British study, which was supported by the ESRC, was completed in 1988 and, with others, will contribute to the building of an international database on secondary school teachers.

Students of foreign languages, many of whom later become teachers, are normally required to spend an extended period abroad as part of their degree course.
This experience forms an important basis of their knowledge of other countries which can influence their role as mediators of other cultures in teaching and other professions.
The focus of most research into residence abroad has been upon the improvement of linguistic skills whereas this project is to investigate the contribution residence makers to students' perceptions of the way of life in another country.
By using a longitudinal approach sensitive to the variation of individual experience, the project aims to collect and interpret information about crucial aspects of the period of residence.
Thirty students of French from two northern universities are participating in the research and are complemented by fifteen French students of English working as French assistants in English Schools.
As well as providing important information on significance of extended residence, it is hoped the project will be of interest to those involved in preparatory courses prior to students' departure.

Contemporary biology textbooks rely heavily on photographs and diagrams to make the meaning of the text clear.
Essential information conveyed in this way may be denied completely to blind students, or if converted to simple raised lines may become confused and meaningless.
This research aims to use existing technology to develop more effective forms of tactual presentation, laid out and labelled in such a way as to guide the students' exploration of the diagrams and contribute an aid to the teaching-learning process.
An attempt is also being made to standardise textures and symbols where possible.
The work is based on a highly successful biology textbook for first examinations, for which only a braille transcription exists.
Diagrams for development are being selected for their usefulness to both the teaching-learning process and course assessment requirements.
Raised form diagrams are being produced on plastic sheets by a vacuum forming process.
The diagrams are being evaluated in use by blind children and their teachers in schools with the researchers participating in the teaching, and through reports, interviews and video recordings provided by pupils and teachers.
Furthermore, the evaluation strategies are designed to provide evidence of the effectiveness of various components of diagrams as conveyors of biological ideas to blind students.

The study seeks to establish a clearer concept and fuller details of the knowledge needed by teachers to enable them to teach effectively two mathematical topics: elementary trigonometry, and areas and volumes.
The research is designed to contribute to an improved foundation for teacher training and teacher appraisal.
A case study approach was adopted.
Seven teachers of widely differing experience each taught five one-hour lessons to an individual pupil while being recorded on videotape.
A pair of identical twins of very similar abilities were taught the same topic by teachers of greatly different experience.
Pupils were tested before and after being taught and teachers' knowledge was assessed by means of interviews and tests.
Three aspects of teachers' knowledge will be analysed: i) knowledge of the subject being taught; ii) capacity to represent it in a variety of appropriate ways related to the knowledge and experience of the type of pupils to whom it was taught; and iii) knowledge and understanding of the relevant pedagogy.
What a teacher knows, or does not know, will then be related to the teacher's effectiveness at different stages of the teaching.
The study also investigates the use of novel research methodology, including the use of identical twins, and new instrumentation.

This research aims to extend and bring up to date a study conducted by Tony Becher and Maurice Kogan during the late 1970's (and reported in Process and Structure in Higher Education, Heinemann, 1980).
Over the last decade major changes have taken place in the structure of higher education and in the interconnections between its main components.
The exploratory model earlier put forward to help clarify the workings of the enterprise will be revised in the light of recent developments, comments from other scholars, and subsequent research done by the principal investigators.
Particular attention will be given to the changing relationships of higher education to the wider social and political context.
A research assistant will be appointed to identify and process relevant official publications as well as scholarly literature.
The principal investigators will be responsible for interviewing key informants about the way the system has been modified in recent years.
A peer review of the outcomes of the enquiry will be undertaken by a working conference of informed critics whose observations will be incorporated into the final presentation of results early in 1990

Multicultural education has become a major educational concern in recent years, especially in schools.
Music's potential contribution to the debate and to children's development of musical concepts and skills has as yet not been researched thoroughly.
Models for broadening the curriculum have begun to be formulated but so far no developed model, together with suitable resources, has been promulgated.
The aims of the project are: 1.
to formulate a rationale for music and multicultural education; 2. to generate suitable materials and teaching strategies.

The aim of this research is to develop and test principles for the design of mathematics teaching which make use of the results of recent research into pupils' understanding.
This research has shown that certain misconceptions commonly arise which can be very persistent, yet go unnoticed.
An example is the idea that multiplying a number always makes it bigger — an idea correctly acquired from experience with whole numbers, but commonly carried over into work with decimal or fractional numbers less than one, where it causes widespread error.
A large majority of secondary school pupils have been shown to suffer from such misconceptions.
The teaching methods being developed by this project include the diagnosis of these difficulties and the provision of material enabling pupils to recognise and overcome them.
This is being done for a number of key mathematical topics such as decimals, ratio, negative numbers and elementary algebra.
Packages will be prepared and tested for each topic.
They will include diagnostic tests, related teaching material from which the teacher can select, and some video tape sequences of pupils to assist the diagnostic process.
The principles of design which emerge from this development will be available for application to further areas of the mathematics curriculum.

The objective of this research is to produce PROBS, a shorthand notation which can be used economically to record and analyse both the interpersonal and intrapersonal intellectual transactions which take place in classrooms where problem solving is taught.
PROBS will cover a range of situations from teacher and pupil explanations through to group discussions.
It will record the level of comment (data driven, heuristic, strategic), the problem solving stage (symbolisation, exploration, etc) as well as the nature of the transaction (eg coaching, exposition, etc).
It will become an essential tool in our ongoing research on methods to facilitate problem solving.
In particular, it will be used as an evaluation tool, to see what changes in classroom activities have actually been brought about; as a teacher training aid, to focus attention onto specific aspects of class and group tuition; as a research tool for exploring the impact of different learning experiences on pupils' problem solving behaviour.

Parental involvement is currently a major issue in primary education, and reading is the main area where schools are now seeking to involve parents directly in the curriculum.
This has come about partly as a result of research over the last 10 years or so into various forms of involvement in the teaching of reading.
However the research has been of variable quality, there are conflicting findings, and the full implications for practice remain unclear.
The study will analyse underlying issues and review research so far in order to identify gaps in our knowledge, findings of importance, and implications for schools.
This means placing parental involvement in its social and historical context, assessing the case for involvement, accounting for its growth in Britain and elsewhere, analysing the process of hearing children read, establishing connections with general features of literacy development, examining techniques for children with special educational needs, analysing processes of home-school communication and clarifying problems of experimental and non-experimental methods of evaluation.

The 1980 Education Act requires schools to publish information on their examination results from 1982 onwards.
The most suitable forms for the presentation of such information have been a matter for considerable debate amongst educational practitioners, both nationally and within local education authorities and schools.
Underlying this debate has been a concern that ‘raw’ examination results might be inappropriately interpreted as measures of schools' effectiveness.
The Contexts Project has three major objectives.
These are: first, to explore through case studies and interviews with experienced educational practitioners the ways in which examination results are currently used and interpreted in schools and local authorities.
Second, to consider in the light of their comments the substantive and statistical issues associated with such interpretations.
And third, to investigate, in a number of schools and local authorities which have indicated their willingness to participate in the research, the strengths and weaknesses of existing data-bases with a view to helping to develop appropriate frameworks and contexts for their interpretation.
Questions about how examination results should be interpreted are of interest in their own right but are also important in studies of school effectiveness and wider debates about how educational institutions should be evaluated and held accountable.

Modern linguistic theory has uncovered a rich network of organising principles which underlie human linguistic ability.
Some researchers maintain that many of these principles are genetically programmed, and it is this which explains how it is possible for speakers of the same language to develop similar and highly complex knowledge of their language, even though, in the normal language learning situation, they will have been exposed only to limited and random samples of speech.
The manner in which these principles of linguistic organisation are involved in the real-time learning of languages — whether it is in the case of children learning their native languages, or adults learning second languages — raises many important questions about the way that innate principles and actual experience of language interact to produce the competence that speakers have in the languages they speak.
The present research project will be concerned specifically with second language learning, and will follow a group of undergraduate learners od French throughout the course of their university studies.
By using both longitudinal and cross-sectional methods, the development of their competence in French will be traced.

Many profoundly deaf children have great difficulty in learning to read.
One reason for this is that reading development is normally closely related to children's knowledge of spoken language.
When hearing children first start to read they are able to make use of what they know about words and the sounds they contain.
But for many deaf children this route to reading is restricted because their knowledge of speech sounds is relatively poor.
Some deaf children are, however, very proficient at sign language and they can also spell out words using finger spelling.
The aim of this study is to examine the influence of these skills on subsequent reading development.
The study will follow the reading progress of both deaf and hearing children in the light of their ability to sign and finger spell.
It will also compare the reading strategies used by signing and non-signing children.

This is a two-year, two stage, project involving a partnership between the University of Sussex, East Sussex County Council and the staff of seven schools.
A core team is made up of a University consultant, an LEA adviser and a senior teacher.
In addition, a senior teacher from each of the six schools will be seconded to the project for one term.
Stage One draws upon recent work on school focused staff development to plan, implement and evaluate schemes in four primary and three secondary schools.
Schools are responsible for devising and implementing their own policies and schemes and the role of the project team is to assist in this.
The approach is participative, involving as many members of staff as possible and including some or all of the following activities: school or departmental self-evaluation; individual review and appraisal; team building; problem solving teams; traditional in-service activities including exchanges, long and short courses, seminars and workshops.
Stage Two involves the project team, senior officers and a representative group of heads in analysing the evaluation results from Stage One and from these, formulating proposals for future action at County level.

The project is concerned with 3 to 10 year old children, and how they learn to use computers.
The investigator is not at this point investigating how the child learns to program the computer although he shall be doing so at a later date.
This research is mainly concerned with how the child uses the computer when performing tasks that are rather like simple games.
These tasks involve the use of different kinds of devices to control a display on the computer monitor.
The kinds of devices that the research will be looking at include a touchscreen, a joystick, a mouse and a trackball.
They have been chosen because there seems to be no evidence as to what features of their design would make them suitable for use by children eg in interactive teaching situations.
The research assesses how difficult these different devices are for children to use and how this changes with age, relating performance to the development of the child's spatial awareness.

This research will investigate the different and perhaps conflicting ways in which professional groups, parents and children view the formal assessment of children's special educational needs under the 1981 Education Act.
The ‘participants’ will be 30 children for whom assessment has been requested on account of emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD), together with the professionals involved in each child's assessment.
The research has 3 principal aims: a) to throw light on the process of assessment from the viewpoints of parents, children, professionals responsible for identifying special needs, and administrators responsible for producing a formal Statement of a child; s needs; b) to describe, and provide an analysis of, sources of conflict and of agreement in the assessment process; c) to develop a theoretical understanding of the concept of EBD from the view-points of the various people involved in assessment, whether as clients or as professionals.
The research will obtain case-study data using observation and interviews.
The sample will not be random, but will be selected to be representative of children in special schools for EBD in terms of social, gender distribution and behaviour problems described by teachers at the time of referral.

Throughout the twentieth century, there have been repeated attempts in England to develop schools chiefly emphasising technical studies.
The Edwardian trade schools gave rise to the Junior Technical Schools of the interwar years and then after 1944 to the Secondary Technical Schools of the post war reorganisation.
Now the concept is being revived with the City Technology Colleges of the 1980s and 1990s.
Yet this form of schooling has never really succeeded in England and has been surrounded by hostile controversy and apathy.
The JTS system failed to develop in the 1920s and 1930s and the STS, after early optimism, suffered from calculated indifference from the Ministry of Education in the 1950s, a preference of the LEAs for grammar schools and ultimately from the shift to comprehensives in the 1960s.
The study analyses the stunted growth of this form of schooling and especially the complex reasons for its failure which is seen as a major defect in the formation of a skilled labour face in England, The research is based on the analysis of documentation in the Pro Kew and elsewhere.
It will also give valued background insight into the ‘third wave’ attempts to revive the form with the contemporary CTC.

The introduction of grant-maintained schools was perhaps the most controversial proposal in the Education Reforms Act 1988, and one which was justified primarily on the grounds that it would extend parental choice in education.
This research aims to explore the origins and implementation of a politically sensitive policy in the context of other recent initiatives which were intended to enhance the quality of educational choice.
It will also aid our understanding of the wider effects of the Education Reform Act, with special reference to the enhanced role given to governing bodies and parent forums, and also to the relative diminution in the position of the LEAs.
The research will feature the extensive use of interviews with individuals involved in policy-making, both centrally and at local educational authority level.
In addition, the impact of grant- maintained schools will be investigated by intensive research in selected areas and this will involve research within grant-maintained and other adjacent schools, and also interviews with school students and their parents about their perceptions of schools and education after the introduction of the Act.

The introduction of the National Curriculum and the associated programme of attainment targets and assessments is probably the most significant innovation in education in England and Wales since the 1944 Education Act.
Major claims have ben made for the benefits of the National Curriculum but much concern has also been expressed at possible negative effects on schools and children.
The initial impact will be felt most keenly in the infant school where the first stages of the National Curriculum are already in place.
The research aims to study the responses of heads, teachers and children in infant schools and departments to the introduction of the national Curriculum and to examine its impact on the curriculum and pedagogy of the infant school and on pupils' school experience.
The study will also evaluate the assessment procedures in use and examine their impact on children and on the school more generally.
Data will be collected by interviews with heads and teachers in an initial national sample of fifty schools and by detailed classroom studies in a sub-sample of ten of the schools.
Interviews will be conducted early in the study and repeated two years later.
Classroom studies will involve observation and discussion with teachers and children and will include periods of time when standard assessment tasks are being completed.

The Parker Report of February, 1986, implemented by the U.G.C. in 1987, calls for an expansion in the training of undergraduates in Oriental and African Languages and cultures.
The report does not address the question of student supply and there is evidence of decline in applications to study Arabic.
This project will gather information that will help to explain the decline in applications to study Arabic and assist departments in their undergraduate admissions policies.
Three approaches will be adopted.
First, an analysis of the characteristics of present and past students of Arabic will establish what kind of students have been attracted to study Arabic and why.
Second, a study of the perceptions of students in schools of the value of studying Arabic in higher education.
This information will help to identify factors which shape their perceptions of the language and cultures of the Arab world.
Third, information will be gathered on factors within higher education which are considered to create problems in expanding Arabic studies, as these were not analysed systematically in the Parker Report.
Information will be gathered by questionnaire from all undergraduates presently studying Arabic and departments will be asked to provide information on past students.
A questionnaire will be sent to a sample of all sixth form or tertiary college institutions and a sub-group of pupils will be interviewed in depth on their views of Arabic studies.
The final report will describe the context of student attitudes and opinions within which expansion must take place and will make a number of specific recommendations on action to be taken by departments of Arabic.

Algebra is an important ‘tool’ for both mathematics, science and technology and pupils' restricted algebraic understandings inhibits progress in these areas.
Research has shown that one of the difficulties which pupils face in algebra is the need to operate on the unknown.
This does not present the same barrier to pupils use of algebraic ideas within computer programming environments.
The aim of this research proect is firstly to identify the characteristics of an algebraic as opposed to an arithmetical approach to solving mathematical problems.
The underlying assumption of the project is that certain computer-based experiences can help pupils bridge the gap between arithmetical and algebraic thinking.
These computer-based experiences will consist of the programming language Logo and a spreadsheet environment.
Pupils aged between 10 and 16 will carry out computer-based and related paper-based algebra activities.

This project investigates aspects of the post-war development of an ever-more global political economy.
More specifically it considers the contradictions of, and the prospects for, international economic co-operation, especially macro-economic co-operation.
The focus is on the Group of Seven (G7) countries (plus the EEC).
The central aim is to shed light on the way problems are conceptualised and how political possibilities inherent in the changing situation are perceived and promoted.
The project thus involves library work, field work and in-depth interviews with theorists, business leaders, and policy-makers in the G7 and in constitutions like the IMF and World Bank.

School governing bodies in England and Wales were reshaped in the Autumn of 1988 as a result of the 1986 (No.2) Education Act, with greater parental representation and more co-opted governors (including those from the business community).
The 1986 Act and the 1988 Education Act have also given governors more power over schools than previously.
The project will focus on an in-depth study of eight school governing bodies (four primary and four secondary) in two Local Education Authorities.
A pilot study has already traced the progress of these new bodies since October 1988.
The research will monitor what coping strategies governing bodies are using to deal with the tasks and responsibilities given to them by the new educational legislation and will also focus on the identification of power relations (including gender and race/ethnicity), decision making processes and networks of influence operating in the eight governing bodies.
The project will, in addition, seek to discover whether co-opted governors and parent governors (widely described as ‘consumers’) come to predominate over those sometimes termed ‘producer’ governors (teacher and Local Education Authority representatives) and headteachers.
The work will be done through observation of formal, informal and sub-committee meetings, attendance at governor training sessions, questionnaires and interviews.

The proposal is to conduct a follow-up investigatory research into the London Enterprise Programme (LEP) entrepreneurial training course.
This programme, now in its sixth year, comprises four linked weekends aimed at assisting people to start and succeed in their own business.
It is funded by the London Enterprise Agency (LEntA) which is, in turn, sponsored by 12 leading large companies: Barclays Bank, BP, Citibank, IBM, ICFC, Legal and General, M & S, Midland Bank, Shell UK, United Biscuits, Wellcome Foundation and Whitbread.
Although involved in organising, promoting and initiating a range of small business related schemes, the London Enterprise Agency sees the London Enterprise Programme as its ‘most notable activity…widely considered to be the best of its kind’(London Enterprise Agency Annual Report, December, 1984).
The research assesses the success of the course, providing long-term feedback and also case-history material for tutors and organisers and also more general data on the problems and opportunities currently facing small businessmen in attempts to develop their markets.
The research also provides new insights into problems of research methodology since a range of techniques are used to boost sample response rates above the notoriously low rates normally achieved in such research.
Links between business success and propensity to complete research questionnaires are also examined.

The pilot Technical and Vocational Education Initiative was introduced to England and Wales in 1983 and to Scotland in 1984 to explore and test new approaches to the education of 14-18 year-olds.
This project will measure the impact of the TVEI pilot in Scotland on such outcomes as school attainment, truancy, staying-on rates, employment, take-up of training, and attitudes.
It will pay particular attention to changes in the impact of TVEI as the initiative developed and matured.
It will use data from the Scottish Young People's Surveys of 1985, 1987 and 1989 to make comparisons between TVEI and non-TVEI pupils in TVEI schools, between TVEI schools and all other schools in Scotland, and between the same schools at different times before and after the introduction of TVEI.
The SYPS is the only dataset which allows TVEI to be analysed in the context of a whole education system.
The project will contribute to research and policy debate in vocational education in policy evaluation, and in assessing the model of innovation adopted by TVEI policy.
The project will contribute to the methodology of evaluating policy by the use of multilevel modelling, a technique that allows influences at different levels (such as student, school, education authority) to be more precisely estimated.

In the light of the increasing emphasis upon persuading people to change their life-styles to protect their health, this study will explore some of the factors which influence readiness to make such changes.
By studying a group of people for whom such lifestyle advice is particularly relevant (those with non-insulin dependent diabetes) we intend to develop a better understanding of how such advice is received.
This project is expected to contribute to the development of effective health education strategies which are relevant to consumers.
It has been suggested that response to lifestyle advice is constrained by a number of factors.
On the one hand, it is argued, people think about health maintenance and illness causation in a range of different ways, and advice will only be acted upon if it is compatible with those prior beliefs.
On the other hand, advice may be ignored if it is considered to be impractical, given the financial and family constraints under which an individual operates.
In-depth, tape-recorded interviews will be carried out with patients and their general practitioners.
These interviews will explore the ways in which patients think about health and illness at a general level, and diabetes in particular, using an approach which depends upon asking the person to recount their personal experiences in the areas of interest, both as a child and as an adult.
In telling such stories, people display the ways in which they think about health and illness, and this is of central interest to this study.
The extent of patients' acceptance or rejection of advice about lifestyle will also be explored, along with the factors individuals see as constraining their behaviour.
Patient views about the appropriate role and relationships between themselves and general practitioners will also be explored.
In the interviews with doctors complementary data about general practitioners' will also be collected.

One of the most visible changes in schools in recent years has been the introduction of the General Certificate of Education (GCSE).
It superceded GCE ‘O’ Level and CSE examinations to constitute a unified system of assessment at the end of compulsory schooling.
The most radical element of the examinations in science was the assessment of pupils' practical skills and abilities by internal, school-based means.
This broad policy decision had to be implemented by examining boards, schools and individual teachers.
The purpose of the study is to identify how the policy was implemented, and what its consequences were for the curriculum, pupils' experience of school science and teachers' professional situation.
The study is based on surveying the documentation of policy at all levels, the deployment of a national questionnaire and detailed investigation of practice in 10 schools.
It is hoped to follow up with work on the teaching and assessment of scientific investigation in the National Curriculum.

The 1988 Education Reform Act brought about the greatest changes to the education system since 1944.
A key element is local management of schools under which local education authorities must delegate budgets to schools for governors and head teachers to manage.
School budgets are set by formula and depend largely on the number of pupils.
This study examined how the amount of money going to around 300 schools in one LEA had been affected.
It was found that schools which experienced budget cuts due to the formula had higher costs because they were small or had surplus places.
Budget cuts were made manageable by both LEA and school strategies.
Almost all schools ended up in the black in the first year.
Subsequent reductions in government spending forced the LEA and schools to cut back.
The project also studies how eleven schools of varying types responded.
Except in very small primary schools, head teachers, deputies and chairs of governors welcomed the increased management responsibility and made genuine efforts to manage resources more efficiently and effectively.
Class teachers were much less enthusiastic.
Schools varied in their capacity to manage resources effectively and were learning as they went along.
Improved management information and decision-making processes are required as well as less uncertainty and change.

A previous ESRC project on Diagnostic Teaching showed striking superiority, for retention, of a teaching method based on exposure of errors and misconceptions and their resolution through intensive conflict discussions.
The present project broadens this work, by studying various ways of enhancing reflection and awareness of learning processes.
A typical previous result is that successful problem solving is associated with the ability to monitor ones progress through the task, alternating between head-down activity and pauses for broader reflection.
There have also been some striking results from an Australian project which developed methods by which the students (aged 15-16) took greater control of their own learning, including planning the lesson sequences and posing their own questions for enquiry.
The present project has designed evaluative materials and intervention materials aimed at developing: awareness of the content and structure of mathematics in general, and of the current topics being learnt; awareness about teaching and learning methods, including distinguishing the methods appropriate to skill, concept and strategy learning; awareness of their own personal learning methods, their strengths and weaknesses; ability to use this knowledge to improve the effectiveness of their learning.
These are being used with different degrees of intensity in about 20 classes over the year 1991-2, with pre and post evaluation and ongoing classroom observation.

Since 1991, primary schools have been required to carry out new procedures in relation to National Assessment of seven year old children at Key Stage 1.
National Assessment is one of many aspects of the Educational Reform Act which teachers are being asked to implement.
National Assessment is a criterion-referenced system involving both internal formative assessment by teachers (T.A.) and external assessments in the form of Standard Assessment Tasks.
This project focuses on teachers' developing assessment practices in relation to both TA and SAT administration at KS1, and on the interpretation and use of results made by other teachers, parents and LEAs.
The findings will make explicit models of teacher assessment, teachers' practical solutions to criterion referenced assessment systems and the use made of assessment results at school and LEA level.
In addition, the study will inform our understanding of teachers' reactions to multiple innovation.

Increasing attention has been paid to the issue of school effectiveness in recent years by both politicians and academics.
This study involves the secondary analysis of data collected as part of a major longitudinal study of pupils' progress and development and the effects of primary schools in the inner London area during the 1980s.
It is designed to extend the original study by making use of more sophisticated statistical models.
It will 1) examine more fully the extent to which primary schools vary in their effects on a variety of pupils' educational outcomes, including progress in reading and maths; 2) establish whether the composition of pupil intakes is related to effectiveness; 3) find out whether school vary in their effectiveness from year to year and whether their effects on pupils persist into secondary school.
Additional information about examination results at age 16 is being added to the existing data-base which covers four years of junior schooling.
The research will make use of multilevel modelling techniques.
The results will further the development of measures of school effectiveness and of performance indicators, and will assist in evaluating the impact of recent changes in the assessment of pupils.

Although religious educators often refer to religion in the lives of children and young people, and recommend that religious education draw on this experience in their teaching, little research has been done in the area.
Using techniques developed during an earlier study of British Hindu children, an ethnographic study of children and young people from Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Sikh backgrounds in the context of their families and faith communities will be conducted in parts of the West Midlands.
The research findings will be published and used in developing an MA course for teachers of religious education.
In addition, curriculum materials (eg., schoolbooks and broadcasts) for use by pupils studying religious education and by teachers of religious education will be developed drawing on the project's empirical research data and employing the project's theoretical work in religious education.
The project forms part of the wider Religious Education and Community Project based in the Department of Arts Education at the University of Warwick.

This is an exploratory study of the interaction between parental choice and school decision-making.
Various provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 (ERA), particularly those relating to LMS (under which a school's funding is based largely on the numbers and ages of its pupils) and more open enrolment, are aimed at creating a climate of heightened competition between schools for pupils, and the present study will be conducted within this new context.
A number of researchers have investigated parents' expectation, preferences and choices with regard to their children's schooling.
This study will focus in addition on the responses made by schools, examining issues such as how they obtain, interpret and act upon clues regarding the preferences of parents of potential pupils, and what factors constrain them in understanding and reacting to such information.
The project will prepare the conceptual and methodological basis for a longer-term enquiry into such issues and test it in one or more pilot studies.
This is one of a number of studies within the Centre examining the implementation of aspects of the ERA, under the general heading of the CHARGE (Challenge and Response in the Government of Education) project.

As the implications the 1988 Education Reform Act, and in particular those concerning the national curriculum, are worked through in British schools, studies of French schooling take on a special significance.
The French education system has had many of the features now introduced into the British system for more than a century and studying them may shed some light on future possibilities for schooling in this country.
Existing published research on French primary education has tended to be quantitative in style with a strong statistical emphasis.
Such studies have yielded valuable insights and are sufficiently broad in scope to permit generalisations for the whole society.
In the literature there is, however, a dearth of qualitative studies of actual social process in French educational settings.
In this project advantage is taken of the researcher's proximity to Northern France and the opportunities this offers to use ethnographic methods in an in-depth study of two Calais primary schools, one in the affluent northern quarter of the town and the other in its educational priority zone.
A key concept to emerge in preliminary field work was that of educational homogeneity and a major focus as the research develops will be on ways and means by which such homogeneity is produced and sustained in two strikingly different socioeconomic circumstances.

Almost all undergraduates studying a foreign language in Higher Education are required to spend one academic year abroad as part of their course.
The purposes are both linguistic and cultural: students are expected to improve their knowledge of the language and culture as a consequence.
There is however insufficient preparation and integration into the rest of the course for the cultural learning which might take place.
This project will develop means which students can better profit from their stay abroad and which will enable their tutors to integrate the learning during the year with parts of the course which takes place before and after.
These means will be derived from social anthropology and ethnography, guiding students' observations and experience of the foreign culture and providing techniques for the production of projects during their period abroad.
In order for this work to be an integral part of the course, tutors also need guidance.
The project is therefore also an exercise in the development of teaching techniques and curriculum change.
Tutors will be the subjects of the project as well as their students.
The evaluation dimension of the project will thus focus on both the nature and degrees of cultural learning during the year and on the feasibility of extending the training of students in ethnographic concepts and techniques to other non-specialist tutors in the same and other institutions of higher education.

The aims of the project
(1)
To contribute to knowledge about the development of childrens exploratory and argumentative talk through classroom activities by:
(i)
identifying ways in which computer-based classroom activities provide a context for exploratory and argumentative talk;
(ii)
identifying the relationship between the context provided by the computer-based activities and other classroom activities;
(iii)
describing, and where appropriate comparing, the range and quality of argumentative talk which arises through such activities;
(iv)
providing information about the role of the teacher in mediating and supporting such activities; and
(v)
providing information about the role of the computer software in mediating and supporting the activities.
(2)
To make a contribution to educational policy and practice by generating practical suggestions for how computers may be used effectively to stimulate exploratory and reasoned argument in the classroom, with particular reference to the curriculum goals of English and spoken language development across a range of curriculum areas.
The focus on argumentative discourse.
The project is gathering information about the way understanding is achieved through the construction of shared meanings in primary classroom interactions.
It focuses on the conversational (or discourse) processes by which knowledge is constructed, shared, debated, interpreted, and misinterpreted as children talk with their peers.
It is this kind of talk that we are calling ‘argumentative talk, in which category we include exploratory talk.
The focus on talk from computer-mediated activities.
A well documented feature of computer use in UK primary schools is their frequent use for collaborative activities.
It has been claimed, usually without substantiating evidence, that these activities involve ‘collaborative talk’ in which children reason with each other about the task on which they are engaged.
The project is investigating
(a)
the extent to which such collaborative conversations at the computer actually take place,
(b)
the nature, quality, and style of the conversations that do take place, and
(c)
the structural and stylistic features of the collaborative (especially the argumentative) talk that does occur.
The settings and activities observed.
The project has worked with teachers in ten schools in Norfolk, Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire.
It has observed and videorecorded children working together on problem-solving adventure games, group-based simulations, collaborative writing on word processors, and data management activities.
It has also observed and made case studies of a ‘typical day’ in many of these classrooms.
The class teachers have collaborated throughout by discussing lesson intentions and outcomes, and by meetings in groups with members of the research team to discuss interim findings.
The outcomes so far.
The project has collected and transcribed 160 hours of videotape which has been analysed by the teachers and the research team.
The research team has generated a framework for analysing argumentative talk which discriminates between types of argumentation.
It has come to some tentative conclusions about the relationship between the quality of argument and computer software.
It has demonstrated an interaction between types of software and types of classroom context.
It has shown the importance of children's previous experience of exploratory discussion and reasoned argument.
The research team has written 9 papers, presented 3 conference papers, and held a day seminar with a Leverhulme-funded project with a similar focus but different methodology.
3 of the project schools have extended and disseminated SLANT work through a 3 month involvement in an NCET project.

The success of evangelical candidates in the recent presidential elections in Peru and Guatamala has drawn attention to the growing strength of Christian evangelicism worldwide and stimulated reflection on apparently parallel fundamentalist upsurges in other religious traditions such as Islam and Judaism.
In Ulster the conservative evangelical constituency is strong and vocal.
Many of those who constitute it would adhere to a world-renouncing ethnic based on a doctrine of separation from the world.
Paradoxically, as it seems to observers, such evangelicals also seem to be disproportionately successful in worldly pursuits; many of them are highly successful careerists in professional and business life.
The researchers propose to investigate and area where the matter is in particularly sharp focus, namely the high academic achievement of children from Brethren, Baptist and Pentecostal backgrounds; they are particularly interested in those instances where the home background may be characterised as working-class.
They propose to research the patterns of socialization operating within the evangelical-baptist culture and thereby to investigate the effect on educational achievement of the cluster of variables they expect to uncover as emphasis on bible study and abstention from aspects of secular culture.
Social interactions of such pupils would also be explored.
But quantitative and qualitative research methods will be used to gather data.

There is widespread rhetoric about the value of shared leadership in secondary schools.
Yet previous research indicates that members of senior management teams in these schools vary in the degree in which they collaborate.
The programme of education reforms currently being introduced by central government requires schools simultaneously to introduce several major innovations.
There is a growing body of professional opinion that senior managers in secondary schools face and increasing need to work in close collaboration if they are to meet this challenge effectively.
The research aims to explore how, in the context of education reform, senior management teams operate in secondary schools where senior staff perceive themselves to be committed to teamwork as their core strategy for managing the school.
Interviews will be conducted in six schools within two local education authorities where all members of the senior management profess to value teamwork.
Two of these schools whose senior management teams have adopted contrasting teamwork styles will be studied in greater depth over a full year.
Members of the senior management teams will be observed during meetings and other activities.
It is anticipated that the findings will lead to greater understanding of the nature of teamwork in secondary schools and its role in the implementation of multiple innovations.

The Technical and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI) is one of the costly curriculum reform programmes ever mounted in the United Kingdom.
From its inception in 1983 to the winding up of the programme in 1987 the government through the Training Agency (formerly the Manpower Services Commission) will have committed close on 1 billion to TVEI.
The Initiative has aimed to bring about major changes in the content and methods of schooling for 14-18 year olds.
By 1997 the education of hundreds of thousands of young people will have been influenced by the TVEI.
By contrast with theses ambitious aims for change in curriculum and pedagogy, research evidence consistently demonstrates that such change is difficult to achieve and sustain.
This project aims to investigate the effects of TVEI in ten secondary schools which have been involved in the Initiative for between six and eight years.
Data collected in these schools will be compared with data collected in these same schools between 1985 and 1987.
This methodology will thus make possible analysis of the medium term impact of TVEI in the ten schools.

The 1988 Education Act has forced schools into a competitive mode of operation.
Local Management of Schools (LMS) under which schools are funded on the basis of pupil numbers, open enrolment which allows schools to recruit outside their immediate catchment area, and the publication of certain test and examination results combine to make schools compete with each other for pupils.
Under these circumstances it is likely that some schools will be less willing to take pupils with special educational needs.
Such pupils are relatively expensive to educate, their presence may make the school less attractive to prospective parents, and they may depress the schools' overall attainment scores on standardised tests.
However, in some LEAs, schools are being encouraged to form ‘clusters’ to combine their efforts and resources to meet a wide a range of special educational needs.
Such clusters will provide support for teachers and for pupils and will create economies of scale which will allow schools to provide extra resources which they would find it difficult to fund out of their individual budget.
The project aims to investigate the incidence and organisation of such ‘clusters’ and to evaluate their effectiveness in supporting pupils with a wide range of special educational needs within mainstream schools.
The project will look in detail at 4 clusters and conduct a survey to assess the extent of cluster arrangements currently in operation.

This project aims to evaluate the usefulness of two styles of motivation in understanding children's learning and behavioural difficulties.
Learned helpless children avoid effort because they believe they are not clever enough to succeed.
Self-worth motivated children protect themselves from the risk of failure on a high status task; they maintain that they could succeed, but see no point in making the effort.
The project's aim will be achieved by developing research procedures for identifying each motivational style in the performance of pupils aged 11-16 in two areas of the National Curriculum.
The research will show whether motivational style is consistent across contexts, in this instance pupils' performance in Maths and English.
Three samples of pupils will be selected.
The results are expected to show whether these motivational styles are more prevalent amongst pupils with learning and behavioural difficulties than amongst pupils who are not identified as having these special needs.
The research will document the development of each motivational style from the final year of primary education to the final year of compulsory education.
A question with implications for policy and for theory is whether learned helplessness and self-worth motivation become more prevalent with age.
The research has four aims:
(i)
To contribute to knowledge and understanding by evaluating the usefulness of the concepts of learned helplessness and self-worth motivation in understanding learning and behavioural difficulties.
(ii)
To develop research procedures for identifying learned helplessness and self-worth motivation in the performance of pupils aged 11-16 in two areas of the National Curriculum.
A theoretical issue arising from this aim concerns the possibility of extending the applicability of theory on self-worth motivation from its original concern with university students to include pupils with learning and behavioural difficulties.
A second issue is whether motivational style is consistent across contexts, in this instance pupils' performance in Maths and English, or varies according to context.
(iii)
To collect a body of information/data on the prevalence of learned helplessness and self-worth motivation in three samples of pupils, and to show whether these motivational styles are more prevalent amongst pupils with learning and behavioural difficulties than amongst pupils who are not identified as having these special needs.
(iv)
To obtain evidence on the development of each motivational style from the final year of primary education to the final year of compulsory education.
A question with implications both for policy and for theory is whether learned helplessness and/or self-worth motivation become more prevalent with age.

The incidence of bully/victim problems in schools within mainstream children has now been well-established; however while it may be likely that children with special educational needs will be over-represented in such categories, there has been very little quantitative evidence on this point, or on which types of special needs children are most likely to be involved, in which way.
This project aims to examine whether certain categories of statemented special needs children are more, or less likely to be involved in bully/victim problems within 8 mainstream schools in Sheffield (3 junior/middle and 5 secondary).
Each child will be interviewed and a teacher at the school who knows them best.
The interviews will be semi-structured, by use of a questionnaire, designed to explore both the childs and the teachers perception of their relationships with peers; their feelings about the school and whether or not they are involved in bullying or are being bullied.
These will commence in Sept/Oct 1991.
These interviews will be repeated in May/June 1992.
During this year planned interventions designed to reduce bullying problems will have taken place within these schools (our existing DES funded project) hence these second interviews will focus on how these interventions have affected the child (as perceived by the child, and by their teacher), as well as whether any involvement in bully/victim problems has been reduced.

Little is known about the ways in which student teachers learn to teach, or about the ways in which preservice professional training might most appropriately be structured to facilitate that learning.
It is known, however, that there are some distinctive features about the learning involved in becoming a teacher: there is a strong experiential element and students rely heavily on their own past experiences of schools and teaching: educational decisions are value saturated and student teachers often experience dilemmas in decisions about their own practice; students frequently experience a certain amount of stress in the learning process; and part of the learning process involves the coordination of a vast amount of different types and areas of knowledge.
The main aim of this project is to investigate the kinds of understandings student primary teachers have of teaching, learning and the curriculum on entry to preservice training and to identify how these understandings are influenced by various training experiences and how these understandings relate to and influence student teachers' developing classroom practice.
The project involves case studies of 10 student teachers following a conventional PGCE course and 10 students on a school-based articled teacher training course.
Both groups of students will be tracked over a 2 year period.
A series of interviews, simulation procedures, and concept mapping exercises are to be used to elicit and monitor the students' knowledge.
It is expected that the project will make a theoretical contribution to the understanding of professional learning.

One of the more interesting aspects of the use of computers in education is their potential for involving children in problem-solving activities.
The computer programming language Logo, in particular, has been presented as an ideal medium for allowing children to develop their thinking skills.
Much early use of Logo involves the driving of a screen ‘turtle’ which can be used to produce mathematical shapes.
However, it is becoming evident that the development of problem-solving strategies does not happen automatically even when the motivational effects of the computer are present.
Effective use of Logo requires the development of mathematical knowledge such as angle, rotation and distance.
In using Logo these aspects of knowledge cease to be merely mathematical concepts but are very much part of the process of the problem-solving activity.
It is the purpose of this research to investigate how changing the feedback provided by the computer affects the complex learning process.
A number of studies will involve children aged between 10 and 12 working with Logo which will provide feedback in different ways.

There has been wide public interest in international comparisons of schooling in recent years.
There is also increased awareness that educational achievements are closely connected to national cultures and traditions.
Comparative education studies, in attempting to describe these contextual differences, have used international ideal-typical models to distinguish initially between national traditions.
Many of these models date from the 1960s and 1970s and contain a ‘cold war’ vision of the world.
In several cases, distinctions are made between ‘traditional’ Western European ‘liberal’modernizing (Northern American) and ‘collectivist’modernizing (Soviet) value systems.
Subsequent economic and political changes such as the emergence of Pacific Basin industrial economies and especially developments in the USSR since 1985, raise questions about the continuing validity of older explanatory typologies.
This project involves the collection of relevant documentary material produced in the Soviet Union and its analysis, with the aid of Soviet consultants.
Propositions that Soviet prevailing educational values were and continue to be ‘collectivist’ and based on scientific Marxism will be examined by reference to debates about the democratization of school organization, the humanization of the content of teaching and the individualization of social opportunities provided by education.
The project is part of a wider investigation which will re-examine international educational typologies as they relate to Western Europe and other regions.

During the past few years there has been an upsurge of interest in the use of open ended investigative work in science with pupils of all ages.
This interest is reflected in the National Curriculum for Science which devotes one of its major components to this type of work.
As yet little is known about the extent to which pupilsilities to carry out scientific activities is dependent on their knowledge and understanding of the facts and concepts of science.
The aims of this project are to:
(i)
to develop a model of childrenerformance in tackling practical investigation tasks in science;
(ii)
to use this model to explore differences in childrenerformance in investigations with increasing age and experience of school science;
(iii)
to investigate the extent and nature of the interaction between childrenonceptual knowledge in science and their procedural knowledge of how to tackle scientific investigations.

The study will examine how pupils school careers are affected by the changing nature of teaching and learning.
It will try to identify what the key moments of commitment/disengagement are, when, and to whom, school offers self-fulfilment and when it operates denial; whether patterns of differentiation persist within the national framework of ‘entitlement’ and equality of opportunity.
These issues will be explored by following a sample of pupils in three schools as they move through the final four years of compulsory education.
The introduction of the national curriculum and new modes of assessment provide a context for the study.
By gathering in-depth interview and observational material, the researchers will be well placed to examine how pupils' experiences of teaching and learning in the early 1990s influence their aspirations, sense of achievement and future life chances.

It has been said that while the 1980s was the decade of efficiency, the 1990s is the decade of quality.
Recent reforms to the Higher Education sector have reinforced accountability and, by increasing competition, put a premium on reputation for quality.
However, there is no agreement within Higher Education about what quality is and how it should be measured.
The 1991 White Paper on Higher Education flagged up the Government's intention of linking quality assessment to decisions about funding Higher Education institutions.
This project aims to develop a framework with which a set of techniques for systematically assessing quality in Higher Education can be tested.
The Project will have two phases: the first will, via a literature search and examination of current practice in Higher Education and non-Higher Education institutions in the UK and overseas draw up a taxonomy of quality assurance/quality management techniques.
A set of criteria will then be developed against which these will be evaluated in order to indicate their relevance and utility in the Higher Education context, given the different focus of all those organisations and individuals making judgement about quality.
In its second phase, a number of the techniques will be tested within a selected number of Higher Education institutions.
Methods which might fall within the ambit of the research are quality management techniques based on agreed standards (e.g. BS5750), more holistic techniques such as‘Total Quality Management’, the development of indices of student and employer satisfaction, and the development of qualitative performance indicators (including value added).

The research will be concerned with the programmes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of schooling which have developed as a consequence of the 1988 Education Reform Act.
The aims of the research will be: to obtain a national picture of the approaches to assessing the quality of schooling to develop a typology of these approaches and an understanding of their different rationales to establish how the various approaches are perceived by those involved to explore, through detailed case studies, how the different approaches influence the practice and development of schools, both in the short and medium terms.
The research project will be organised round three main activities: A national survey of all LEAs to establish the broad approaches to assessing the quality of schooling which are being adopted.
A panel study to explore with those responsible for the conduct of programmes how these have developed and how they are working in practice.
Detailed field studies based on a number of primary and secondary schools, in different parts of the country, which will have recently undergone a major evaluation exercise.
The aim of the research is to help those with responsibilities for educational provision to meet a significant challenge of the 1990s, namely: to establish systematic and credible systems for assessing the quality of schooling and thereby to improve the learning opportunities of all young people.

Many institutions in Further and Higher Education are developing policies on equal opportunities but most are facing difficulties in trying to put policy into practice.
This project will explore the strategies deployed by three institutions committed to developing more equitable staff policies and practices in the hope that illumination of particular change contexts will be of value to other institutions wishing to make similar changes.
It is intended to make detailed case-studies, over two years, of three educational institutions: one each from further education, polytechnic and university sectors, chosen to reflect the diversity of cultures and structures in post-compulsory education and on the basis of their explicit intention to implement equal opportunities policies.
Areas to be explored include: 1.
The policies and practices most likely to enhance the recruitment and promotion of under-represented groups in educational institutions and the main obstacles to these developments.
2.
How such policies and practices are initiated, developed, implemented and evaluated.
3.
Any differences in institutional developments as they apply to specific groups.
4.
How this study may contribute to theoretical and empirical work both on equal opportunities and the study of management and organisations.

School Development Plans are one of the methods currently being used to improve the performance of primary schools.
Based mainly on research evidence that some schools are more effective than others in promoting the progress and development of their pupils, School Development Plans provide a mechanism to link the planning of improvements with the financial and staff development planning of the school as a whole.
They have been pioneered in this country, the United States and Australia over the last few years mainly by individual schools and by some local education authorities.
Recently the idea has been adopted and promoted by the Department of Education and Science.
The project aims to investigate whether these plans — and the process of planning — are having positive impacts on the school as a whole, on its classes, and on the learning of individual pupils.
In addition, it will seek to analyse the most effective components of the planning process and to identify their implications for school managers.
Schools in three contrasting areas at different stages of developing their planning have been chosen to provide a suitable sample.
A mixture of qualitative and quantitative research methods will be employed to collect evidence about the efficacy and impact of the Plans.

Increasingly in recent years, policy makers have been concerned to stimulate more young people to participate in education and training after the age of 16.
Britain's participation rate is lower than in equivalent countries but has grown dramatically during 1989-91.
Explanations of both phenomena remain partial and insufficiently grounded in theory empirical data.
The seminar group will convene leading researchers in this field for six meetings over two years.
The group has two main aims.
First, it will seek to identify significant determinants in the decisions of young people in this age group to seek either further education and training or leave the system.
These determinants will be assessed in the light of current and proposed reform policies.
Second, the seminar group will consider the extent to which the theory and data currently available about individuals' decision-making in this field can inform the policy reform process.

This seminar series is stimulated by research studies that have arisen in response to the 1988 Education Reform Act (ERA).
It provides the opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to present and discuss papers about the methodological perspectives used in existing studies of the framing and impact of the ERA.
The seminars also address some of the ethical issues surrounding investigations of politically sensitive issues in education.
The series encourages contributions from postgraduate students as well as established researchers.
It is intended to foster greater appreciation of the complex and contentious issues associated with research in this and other controversial areas.
Seminar topics will include: the role of theory in the research process; the relationship between educational institutions and the wider social and political context; access to elite personnel and sensitive documents; partisanship and neutrality in carrying out research; the usefulness and validity of case study research; the relative contribution of survey techniques and non-statistical approaches to understandings of the ERA.
Attendance at the seminars, which begin in April 1992, is by invitation only.

In 1988 the ESRC established a research initiative on The Educational Needs of a Multicultural Society.
This emerged partly in response to the issues raised in the 1985 Swann report into the education of ethnic minority pupils in British schools.
Seven projects were funded under this initiative; three focussed on multilingual education whilst the other four were concerned with the relationship of ethnic minority pupils with their white counterparts, their teachers and the organisational structure of schools.
With the assistance of Dr Viv Edwards (University of Reading), Dr Troyna will be synthesising the main results of these projects and assessing their contribution to current thinking on how educational systems might respond positively and most effectively to the demands of democratic multicultural societies.

The National Curriculum makes enormous demands on teachers in rural primary schools, requiring a staff of two or three to cover nine curriculum areas and five cross-curriculum themes.
In addition, there may be too few children in each age group for them to benefit fully from some of the recommended classroom activities.
To overcome these problems, small schools in some rural areas have formed cooperative clusters whereby teachers provide curriculum support for each other.
In some cases school finances are being pooled to fund in-service training, large expensive resources and joint activities for the children.
This research project will concentrate on the effects of cluster involvement on the implementation of National Curriculum mathematics, science and geography at year 3.
Nine schools in three Midlands LEAs, will be identified for in-depth study, following a questionnaire survey.
A repeated sequence of classroom measures and interviews with staff and governors will be used to relate the extent of cluster involvement to the degree that National Curriculum innovations have been implemented.

Preliminary work has indicated that creativity is central to the work of the primary school teacher.
This, however, is not generally recognised and with the advent of the National Curriculum some have argued that there will be even less scope for innovation.
The central issue in this research, therefore, is the characterization and evaluation of creative teaching, and the extent to which the National Curriculum is a constraint and/or an opportunity for its accomplishment.
The broader issue is how can some of the best education in primary schools be identified, preserved and promoted in the age of the Education Reform Act.
What, in general, are the conditions that promote and obstruct creative teaching?
In addition, it is expected that the work will lead to developments in collaborative research between researchers and teachers.
It is hoped that it will inform school and teacher policy and practice, especially in assisting in the adaptation to the National Curriculum, and in advising on the extent such teaching promotes equal opportunities.

There is a growing body of research relating to school effectiveness in which effective schools and/or departments are identified by one or more outcome measures.
The most common measure is examination success and typically there is statistical control for intake measures.
But what are the long term influences of' effective' schools?
This project will re-establish contact with students who completed their A levels over three years ago and will link ‘value added’ measures of A level departments to the subsequent achievements, attitudes and aspirations of their students.
Extensive data are already available for this project through the A Level Information System (ALIS).
At a simple level one might suppose that effective departments can do nothing but good.
But it may be that an unusual boost at A level could place students in situations where they find themselves uncomfortably out-performanced by their peers.
This could have unfortunate consequences on their performance and/or their self-esteem.
Alternatively it has been suggested that it is not so much the school effect which is important as the curriculum which is followed.
The proposed exploratory research intends to follow up these ideas and to establish tentative assessments of these hypotheses so extending our understanding of effective schools and their long term influence.

The Scottish reforms for curriculum, assessment and national testing for 5 to 14 year olds are likely to influence teachers' ideas about teaching and learning.
This project aims to explore what teachers implementing the programmes assume about the way children learn, how they interpret the differences among their pupils (in the new atmosphere which emphasises ‘attainment targets’) and the ways in which they cater for those differences.
The work will focus on two curriculum areas within the new reforms: mathematics (which has national testing) and environmental studies (which does not).
Twenty teachers in eight schools will be involved with classes of 6, 8, 12 and 14 year olds.
The research methods will include classroom observation, interviews with teachers and analysis of curriculum documents and of other support.
Particular attention will be paid to the impact of the reforms on teachers' classroom goals.
Do they now emphasise ‘progress’ more than ‘activity’goals?
There will also be concern with teachers' conceptions of how pupils influence both those goals and the actions taken to achieve them.
Finally, teachers' explicit use of ‘attainment’ targets, their strategies of assessment and remediation and evidence about how they think about children's learning will be explored in depth.

The past few years have seen an unprecedented number of attempts to find new ways of training teachers, by reforming existing routes to Qualified Teachers Status and developing new ones.
Accompanying these reforms, there has been a vigorous public debate about the value and relevance of teacher education.
Yet there has been no systematic attempt to examine the current nature of teacher education, the notions of professionalism implied by different approaches, the amount of school-based work they involve, or the particular competencies they seek to engender.
To help provide a sharper focus to current policy debates, and in preparation for a larger study of the effects of teacher education, this project will establish an up-to-date database on the nature of a range of approaches to initial teacher education.
The study will be based on a survey of all teacher training institutions in England and Wales and a more detailed analysis of about 50 courses.
These will include conventional undergraduate and postgraduate teacher training courses, innovative courses, articled teacher schemes and programmes of training for licensed teachers.
An attempt will also be made to develop a methodology for establishing the direct and indirect costs of these different modes of teacher education.

A school's staff includes, other than teachers, a number of postholders whose work contributes to the efficient operation of the institution.
Recent changes in education — particular the introduction of the national curriculum and of local management of schools — have accelerated the demand for associate posts to assist in the provision of the curriculum and to support the management and administration of increasingly complex institutions.
The innovatory use of associate staff within the maintained sector has been explored by the grant-holders in an earlier study, funded by the Department for Education.
Building on the earlier work, this study investigates some of its unanswered questions in the context of City Technology Colleges (CTCs); institutions which, themselves, were created to be innovatory.
The project team will collect information on the benefits and disbenefits of the innovatory associate staff posts, and on their effect on the traditional boundaries of teachers' roles in a representative sample of CTCs.
The cost-effectiveness of the posts will also be explored.
As well as this empirical investigation, the researchers will be seeking to evaluate — and extend — current theories of how change is implemented in educational settings.

A two-year grant has established the above group in order to promote and facilitate the use of the National Child Development Study (NCDS) data, held in the ESRC Data Archive, by secondary analysts.
NCDS is a long-term study of some 15,000 people born in the week 3-9 March, 1958.
Data from the original birth study and from follow-ups at the ages of seven, eleven and sixteen have been lodged with the Data Archive and available for secondary analysis for some time.
They have recently been supplemented by the addition of public examination results (CSE, O-Levels and A-Levels) and the data from the latest stage of the study, entailing substantial personal interviews at the age of twenty-three.
The latter also includes area data from the 1971 and 1981 Censuses, linked to 16-year and 23-year addresses, and a substantial number of derived variables created by the original research team at the National Children's Bureau.
The major task of the User's Support Group is to improve the quality of the data set and its documentation in order to ease and encourage its use by other researchers.
In addition, it is planned to produce a number of purpose-built datasets for research and teaching purposes.
Initial enquiries about the content of the data and access to them should be made to either Professor John Fox at City University or Ken Fogelman at the National Children's Bureau.

Foreign language teaching in English secondary schools is expected to contribute to children's linguistic and social learning.
Social learning involves acquiring understanding and tolerance of other, foreign, people.
The research aims to investigate the contribution to pupils' understanding and tolerance made by language teaching.
It will describe and analyse how pupils perceive foreign people, in particular the French, and which environmental factors, including foreign language teaching, influence their perceptions.
Language teaching will thus be set in the context of other influences.
The process of language teaching will also be analysed in order to describe the relationship between pupils' perceptions and the teaching to which they are exposed.
The research methodology will include the use of questionnaires to establish the range of pupils' perceptions.
Individual representative pupils will then be selected and interviewed in depth to identify and elucidate the nature of these perceptions and the factors which influence them.
This procedure will be applied in two distinct groups, one before and one after the pupils have begun to learn French.
The particular contribution of the teaching of French to pupils' perceptions will be explored through observation by a researcher based in the two schools over a period of at least six months.

The literature on home-school-community relations has concentrated mainly on parental participation in school, rather than on school participation in the ‘communities’ of the school.
This project on parental perspectives on schooling is an anthropological investigation of education in urban London.
It focuses on the wider community context by going beyond the school in order to explore relationships outside it in which parents themselves have a high profile.
It aims to identify the variation in views parents hold about schooling as determined by, for example, their social location, their class position, the network of the household, and their activities within organisations in the locality.
The research will also explore the interplay between class, ethnicity and gender in parental interaction with the school.
The research methodology involves a study of the area around a junior school, the social organisation of its population; an in-depth study of a number of households spanning a range of class and ethnic origins, and a survey of households with children in the same school.
The project aims to contribute to the home-school relations debate, and to the more recent discussions about the introduction of community education in Local Education Authorities.

Language development occurs as a result of the interaction and development of the skills of listening, talking, reading and writing.
Recent research has shown that an effective way of encouraging the interaction of these skills is to have children write, read out, ‘publish’ and have others read their own material.
A major problem faced by children when carrying out frequent revisions of written work is that of having to hand-write revised versions of the material.
Small scale research suggests that when children are relieved of the burden of hand-writing and hand-rewriting stories they are able to give more attention to structure and composition.
This research investigates the use of Microwriter Quinkeys linked to BBC microcomputers as a means of overcoming the practical classroom problems inherent in an interactive-cooperative approach to language development and to assess the impact on language development in young children.

This project studies the training of primary school teachers in respect of their preparation for the teaching of science and writing.
For each of these components of primary education the investigator is concerned to improve the quality of initial training.
Science has been observed by Her Majesty's Inspectors to be a neglected area of activity in many primary schools.
This is in spite of the existence of clearly articulated curriculum materials and guidelines.
Writing is included because, particularly at the later phases of primary schooling, curriculum guidelines are rare, and it remains unclear as to what might reasonably be expected of children once they have mastered putting words onto paper.
Whilst paying due attention to individual differences among incoming students as a potential source of subsequent competence, the investigator is especially concerned with the effects upon this of variation in course provision and course participation.
The project attends especially to teaching practice as a context for learning what and how to teach.
The project is being mounted with the collaboration of Bath College of Higher Education, the College of St Paul and St Mary at Cheltenham and Westminster College, Oxford.

The research investigates the training of students in two contrasting institutions to teach history to pupils aged between 11 and 16.
It investigates two interrelated areas.
First, it makes a detailed analysis of the conceptual understanding of the teaching and learning of the subject within the institution.
The research seeks to identify both the understanding of the nature of history which PGCE students bring to the institutions, and the extent to which institutions consider the structure of the subject and link it with a theory of the development of pupils' thinking in history and the styles of teaching best suited to further such development.
Secondly, the research will assess the school-based experience and training that the students receive in teaching methods in order to determine the extent to which students have mastered an understanding of the nature and development of pupils' historical thinking and are able to exemplify such understanding in their teaching styles.
Such research could both identify effective strategies for the training of history teachers in the light of our understanding of the nature and development of pupils' historical thinking and further the debate on the relationship between teaching styles and pupils' conceptual hierarchies in history.

Following the publication by the Council in 1983 of the report ‘Microcomputers in Education: A framework for research’ by Mr Morley Sage and Mr David Smith, the Education and Human Development Committee embarked on a series of consultation exercises involving researchers, policy makers and practitioners.
While accepting in principle the conclusions of the report, the outcome of this process led the Committee away from the establishment of a single new research centre and to appoint a co-ordinator as the focal point for the development of the initiative.

The teaching of history, along with that of other subjects in the school curriculum, has undergone critical examination in recent years.
There is a substantial literature on new developments in history teaching and Her Majesty's Inspectorate have recently published ‘History in the Primary and Secondary Years’(HMSO 1985).
The time is opportune therefore, to study the changes which are taking place in the aims and practices of teaching history in schools.
This research pays particular attention to the nature of the history and the history teaching to which students training to be history teachers are introduced.
The study begins by focusing on past and current claims for the value of teaching history in secondary schools.
The second stage of the study will look at how teachers turn their aims into practice in the classroom.
The final object of the study will be to develop a schedule which could be used by teachers, tutors and students to observe and analyse their work in the classroom.
It is hoped that the study will be of interest to all those who are involved in current developments in history teaching.
Evidence will be gathered from history teachers and tutors who are involved in training history teachers, from students in training and from academic historians.
Three main methods of inquiry will be used — interviews, questionnaires and observation ofhistory teachers, tutors and students at work.
In addition, a study will be made of syllabuses, previous studies of this kind and other relevant documentation.

Everyone is aware that the teaching profession is under stress at the present time.
Some of the reasons are temporary, others are more long-lasting in their significance.
All affect the quality of life for teachers and pupils.
This research hopes to identify which factors continue to contribute to job satisfaction in teaching (even in the present circumstances) and which factors teachers find depressing and difficult in establishing professional recognition.
At the end of the research, the investigator will report on the survey and interviews to policy makers and others who are in a position to make recommendations for improved teacher training and career development.
A number of specific studies are included in the project
(a)
the training and induction of young teachers;
(b)
the experiences and challenges facing teachers in schools situated in areas of high social disadvantage in the UK and USA;
(c)
a comparative survey of secondary teachers' professional satisfactions in the UK and USA.
The cross-cultural studies have been sponsored (1984-85) by the British Council/Fulbright Higher Education Links Scheme.
A research team in the School of Education at the University of Michigan is collaborating in conducting a survey of the professional satisfactions of some British and American secondary school teachers.

The investigators undertake the testing of children between the ages of 7 and 15 in schools in certain local education authorities where there are significant numbers of children from the Asian and West Indian ethnic groups.
The investigators have already tested children in primary schools in Peterborough and have had permission to go back to further test these as well as to test in Bedford and Luton.
The tests will be on non-verbal reason, vocabulary, reading and mathematics.
The investigators can also obtain, from school records, some information about each child's family circumstances and thus will attempt to confirm what both the Child Health and Education Study and the National Child Development Study data suggested, that differences in test performances are strongly associated with differences in social circumstances.
These new data (it is hoped to test a total of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 children, of whom approximately 40-50% will be from one of these ethnic minorities) should provide answers to several questions: What is the relative standing of different ethnic groups on various tests?
Does their performance vary with age, that is to say, do they catch up with or fall progressively further behind white children as they grow older?
What is the relation between scores on supposed tests of ability (IQ tests) and on tests of more conventional school attainment (reading and maths)?

This project will examine the experiences and characteristics in early adulthood of people who had truanted when at school.
It is based on the National Child Development Study which has been following a cohort of some 15,000 people from their birth in 1958 to early adulthood.
At the ages of 11 and 16, teachers, parents and the young people themselves reported on whether they had truanted.
About 8% did so regularly at the age of 16.
Within the information now available on these same people in adulthood, it will be possible to shed some light on the causes of truancy.
Was truancy a symptom of wider emotional problems, or were the schools failing to provide education appropriate to these young people's needs and interests?
Or had the truants simply outgrown school, but were ready for the world of work?
Such competing explanations tend to different predictions of what can be expected in early adulthood as to whether or not the former truants have, for example, experienced difficulties in the labour market or high levels of unemployment, acquired qualifications since leaving school, or met with problems in other aspects of their lives such as their marriages or their mental health.

The Warnock Report and the subsequent 1981 Education Act focused attention on the education of children with special educational needs.
The evidence available shows that school provision could have a marked impact on the way in which special needs arise, and can be met; yet schools appear to have no clear view on what provision is the most effective.
Provision varies, from mixed ability teaching, to withdrawal, separate special classes and within-class support, but none of these approaches has been carefully evaluated.
The aim of this study is thus to examine in detail different kinds of provision for children with special needs in the first year of secondary schooling.
Children will be followed from their primary to their new secondary schools and their progress will be charted in relation to such factors as school policy, curriculum, teaching approaches, diagnosis and placement, and the appropriateness and quality of their learning experiences.
The long term aim is to provide evidence on which can be based policies for effective school provision.

Considerable resources have been spent on equipping schools with computer hardware and software.
At the same time, research in a range of contexts and countries has indicated that even the very best computer software cannot stand by itself.
These studies have all confirmed that the teacher assumes a critical role in children's computer-based activities, and one which may differ in a number of important respects from that traditionally adopted.
This project is based on a recognition that:
(a)
there exists a considerable need on the part of mathematics teachers to learn about and apply the computer in their work, and
(b)
that in particular roles, the computer can have a positively influential effect on the education and training of mathematics teachers.
This research is aimed at investigating the educational potential for the mathematics classroom of a small number of powerful computer applications.
Some of them, such as the LOGO programming language were specifically designed with education in mind.
Others, such as‘spreadsheet’ programs were not.
In each case, the research is aimed at structuring these applications with pedagogic aims and objectives.
The aims of this proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a programme of in-service teacher-education concerned with the use of some content-free computer applications in mathematics.
Experienced secondary mathematics teachers will be seconded for 30 days in the academic year, to gain experience of the applications, examine the educational implications of the software, and to design and test computer-based educational environments for the classroom.
The outcome of the work will be:
— a description of this computer-based INSET programme and its evaluation.
The evaluation will consist of:— baseline criteria for the effectiveness of a computer based course — a description of critical aspects of course implementation — an analysis of the reciprocal interactions between teachers' views of mathematics, mathematics teaching and computers and their progress on the course.
— one computer-based microworld which is ‘built into’ the school mathematics curriculum and its evaluation in terms of specific mathematical learning outcomes.

A central problem in teacher education has been how to get student teachers to apply in the classroom the insights they gain in their education courses, so that their teaching becomes intelligently skillful.
Modern research confirms that in the early stages of acquiring a complex competence, the learner benefits from close guidance from the instructor, but this could not take place overtly without disruption in the case of teaching.
However, preliminary studies have indicated considerable potential in an arrangement termed Radio-assisted Practice (RAP), in which supervising tutor communicates with student teacher during actual teaching by means of a miniaturised radio link.
The present project's two main aims are, first, to investigate the effectiveness of RAP for enhancing student teachers' skill in class management/control and concept teaching; second, to find out in what ways it may be necessary to train teacher training supervisors to use RAP effectively with their students.
A variety of cross-checking research techniques is used: in addition to examining effects on student teachers' and pupils' observed behaviours, the processes of RAP usage and preparation are monitored, including the participants' own reactions and experiences.

With the development of New Technology, in-house training by Industry has been better facilitated and has taken on increased importance.
In particular, the use by firms of computer based packages (including interactive video) as well as written text, audio and tape-slide structured programmes, have allowed access by the employees to a wide range of open-learning programmes.
For some years, Jaguar Cars Ltd., have been operating self-teach Open Learning Centres using commercially available and internally produced computer-based and interactive video materials.
These are available for the use of employees both inside and outside normal working hours.
The research aims to provide information on the influence of these Open Learning Centres on for example, user motivation and individual satisfaction obtained from the self-teach programmes, and the Company response.
Evaluation will be based an employee interviews, and the principal technique used will be by survey of a range of personnel, carried out in co-operation with the Jaguar training staff.
In addition, this investigation may serve as a pilot scheme leading to a more extensive survey of the effectiveness of open-learning via the use of questionnaires, and possibly involving other companies.

The research has two main aims:
(1)
to provide independent accounts of a range of new approaches to teaching information technology; and
(2)
to develop from these accounts an analysis of policy options for incorporating information technology into the whole curriculum.
An independent analysis of policy options is urgently needed by curriculum planners; but this has to be grounded in evidence of current practice as well as the claims of IT proponents.
Hence part of the research will be case studies of about 6-8 IT initiatives, chosen for their diversity of aim and approach.
These will include accounts of how IT is being taught and how it was introduced, together with an assessment of its impact of staff and pupils.
The analysis of policy options will focus on the relationship between the curricular aims of these IT initiatives and whole curriculum policies for the 9-14 age range.
Discussion documents will be prepared in a form accessible to curriculum planners, tested and revised in the light of comments received.
Both case studies and policies will be published as a guide for curriculum planners.

The research, which acknowledges the profound effect on the student in changing to a different concept of learning, and the important effect of his previous full-time learning environment, sets out to develop an effective methodology for creating a research skills profile of the PhD student at the commencement of his course.
The second objective is to conceptually analyse the non-course related and the range of thesis skills that each student requires and the means by which he acquires them.
The third objective will be to monitor the success of a sample of PhD students taking part in either:—
(a)
the new doctoral programme or
(b)
the traditional PhD, in the same discipline in different universities.

What are their attitudes, motivations, aspirations?
How do the various sub-groups of the discipline view one another?
The methodology is qualitative: interviews with individuals, students and staff in different types of institution; inter-group conferences; interviews with individuals having above-average influence in the discipline.
Conceptually, it is hoped that some light will be thrown on the whole question of disciplinary boundaries or subjects; these are the bricks out of which the whole educational edifice is constructed and yet we know little about them and there are those who doubt their very existence.

Government statistics indicate that business formations in the UK have increased since the onset of the current economic recession.
There is speculation as to the reasons for this trend.
On the one hand, it has been interpreted as indicating a revival of entrepreneurial vigour with new firms being formed either on the basis of new technologies or else in order to exploit market opportunities which have emerged as a result of the recession.
Alternatively, it has been suggested that the trend is simply a reflection of the large numbers of businesses which have been established by unemployed individuals who see no prospect of finding gainful employment.
This research aims to shed light on this controversy by undertaking a survey of new manufacturing firms started in South Hampshire since 1979.
By comparing the results of this survey with those of a previously conducted survey of firms started prior to 1979 it will be possible to establish
(a)
whether the characteristics and motivations of new firm founders have changed since the onset of recession,
(b)
whether there has been any significant change in the industrial distribution of new businesses and
(c)
whether the awareness and usage among new firm founders of government measures to assist small firms have increased in recent years.

The Health Research Group in the Department of Geography and Earth Science, Queen Mary College, has recently conducted Tower Hamlets (inner City East End); Victoria District Health Authority (inner City West End); Redbridge (north east suburban).
The surveys have collected information for individual respondents on self reported morbidity, use of health services, socio-economic characteristics, and living conditions.
It is proposed to link respondents' addresses to census enumeration districts representing their residential locality.
This will provide information on neighbourhood characteristics from the 1981 Census to analyse in combination with the individual survey data.
Collaboration with the research team of St Mary's Department of General Practice, Paddington is also planned, to investigate the association between the classification of localities according to their Under-Privileged Areas Index and individual morbidity reported in the HRG surveys.
The research will address particularly two issues in Metropolitan health and welfare planning: To what extent are socially disadvantaged individuals concentrated in relatively deprived geographic areas? and how are individuals self reported morbidity and health service use related to the social characteristics of the neighbourhoods where the survey respondents live?
The research linked together the relevant data bases, and concentrated particularly on the statistical association between the UPA index for small areas (and its component indicators) and self-reported morbidity of residents of the small areas.
The results provide a new perspective on the association between area deprivation indicators and population health.

The region is an important tier in allocating resources for health care but regional authorities have to rely on coarse-grained information such as death rates to decide the level of funding that should go to particular districts and services.
This research aims to investigate the possibility of obtaining information for decision-makers that is more sensitive to people's health needs.
It employs structured health behaviour questionnaires and informal, in-depth interview techniques to discover if there are regional variations in how people see health and illness, if these views affect the ways in which people need health care, and if these perceived needs are in turn related to the actual demand for and use of health care facilities.
As other studies have shown that working class people suffer most from ill-health and also use health services less effectively than others, the research investigates three small samples of such people in three different areas: East London, Birmingham and Leeds.
The samples are drawn from one enumeration district (ED) in each area, all the EDs having similar population characteristics.

The most economically prosperous parts of the UK at the present time are widely regarded as the towns and cities located on a broad axis extending from Cambridgeshire to Dorset and Avon.
Within this belt, ‘city-regions’ such as Reading, Bristol and Southampton have escaped the massive ‘de-industrialisation’that has affected London, the Midlands and the North.
These southern areas have achieved an enviable record of employment growth in the service sector and enjoy high rates of new firm formation, especially in high technology sectors.
In consequence, these cities have relatively low levels of unemployment.
These characteristics, which bear a superficial similarity to urban areas in the southern states of the USA have encouraged such places to be labelled the ‘Sunbelt Cities’ of Britain.
This research project examines Southampton, one of the most dynamic of these ‘sunbelt’ city regions which throughout the 1970's generated more jobs than any other urban area in England and which has seemingly incurred only a relatively small loss of jobs since the onset of recession.
The study has two aims.
First, by analysing the strategies of the leading firms in the area, the study will explain the reasons for the limited impact of the recession.
Second, it will probe beyond the superficial veneer of economic growth and prosperity by examining the impact of recent economic trends on the changing types of jobs available to workers in the city-region.
In view of the widespread evidence that corporate strategies to restore profitability since the onset of the recession have emphasised the control of labour costs and increased productivity, the researchers will examine the impact of such strategies on the range and quality of employment opportunities available in the Southampton area.
Issues such as whether there has been a decline in the proportion of ‘good’ jobs, ie those which are highly skilled, stimulating, well-paid and secure and with good opportunities for career progression, and whether there has been an increase in ‘bad’jobs, ie those which require low skill, are boring, poorly-paid, insecure with limited opportunity for career advancement, will be addressed.
The research will also investigate the extent to which ‘flexibility strategies’ have been introduced by employers.
While much previous research by geographers, economists, sociologists and planners has tended to focus on the cases and consequences of industrial decline in the conurbations of northern Britain and London, this research attempts to break new ground both in examining the cause of economic growth and prosperity in southern England and in seeking to assess the extent to which the benefits of growth have been equally shared amongst different segments of the population in such areas.

This award, under the Franco-British (ESRC/CNRS) exchange scheme, funded a number of visits to France to carry out collaborative research with colleagues of the Institut National de la Sante et Recherche Medicale, France.
The work focusses on disability among the elderly, service provision for dependent elderly people and inequalities in health and illness.
Much of the data used for these comparative analyses comes from surveys carried out in the community parts of Britain and France.
An important objective of the ESRC/CNRS exchange scheme was to establish cooperation between researchers in Britain and France.
This has been achieved since the collaboration originally initiated and sustained by means of this series of ESRC/CNRS grants is still continuing.S.
Curtis undertook a longer research visit of 9 months funded through the INSERM ‘post-vert’ visiting research fellowship scheme, during 1989.
A tri- national research network is being set up to study measures of the quality of life, which includes Queen Mary and Westfield College and our collaborating centre in France (INSERM CJF 88-12).
EC ERASMUS funding has been obtained for a teaching visit to l'Universite Paul Valery, Montpellier in 1990.

In a recently published report, a Common Land Forum (set up by the Countryside Commission) has recommended that the general public should be granted a right of legal access to all areas of common land.
Although definitive information is lacking, it has been estimated that such a right currently applies to just 20% of the 1.5 million acres of common land in England and Wales.
The report also proposes that formally constituted management associations should be established to guide and coordinate the use and long-term development of individual commons.
An initial aim of this project is to identify and categorize those areas of common land over which the general public have a legal right of access.
Drawing information from a variety of sources, and in particular from a national database of commons being structured at the Department of Geography, Aberystwyth, representative samples of ‘public access’ commons will be selected for analysis, with a view to evaluating the ways in which such areas are administered, the problems that they face, and the effectiveness of particular schemes of management and regulation.
Finally, the study will seek to relate the findings to current proposals concerning the future of common lands in England and Wales.

The Economic and Social Research Council has established a series of Regional Research Laboratories to promote the wider use of data collected by academic researchers, commercial organisations and government departments.
This new research initiative indicates the Council's commitment to funding projects that will help information users of all kinds to take advantage of recent developments in information technology.
The ESRC's Research Resources and Methods Committee has earmarked an initial budget of 375,000 for this initiative which was launched in January 1987.
The first phase of the initiative will last eighteen months.
During this time an overall strategy will be developed drawing on the experiences of the selected trial centres in order to provide a firm base for planning of the second phase which will begin in mid-1988.
The national coordinator of the initiative is Professor Ian Masser (Department of Town and Regional Planning, University of Sheffield).
Michael Blakemore of the Department of Geography at the University of Durham is the Technical Advisor.
The Regional Research Laboratories will act as local data libraries housing the most widely used national data sets.
An important part of the effort at each centre will be devoted to technical issues relating to the development of the software that is needed to make the information more accessible to potential users.
Full advantage will be taken of recent developments in networking and computer technology and attention given to issues of data base management and methodological problems of spatial analysis.
The Regional Research Laboratories will also take on a training function as they develop and organise courses and workshops at the regional level to promote their facilities.
Contracts have been awarded to four centres so far, based at Cardiff, Edinburgh, London and Newcastle.
The work that will be carried out by these centres during the trial period builds upon their previous experience in this field:
In Edinburgh a team of investigators from the Centre for Applications Software and Technology at the University of Edinburgh headed by Peter Burnhill will be using the University's data library facilities as a test bed for the development of software to improve the links between user and software and software and data.
In Cardiff a team from the Department of Town Planning at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology under the direction of Professors Michael Batty and Neil Wrigley will work together with colleagues from the statistics group at the University of Bath and the South West Universities Computer Centre to develop demonstration projects for Wales and South West England.
The London part of the project involves a consortium of researchers from the Geography Department at the London School of Economics headed by Professor Derek Diamond and his colleagues at Birkbeck College headed by Professor David Rhind.
This consortium will concentrate on establishing an integrated urban and regional infrastructure data base for London and the South East.
The Newcastle trial centre involves collaboration between teams based at the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies of the University of Newcastle and the Geography Department of the University of Lancaster under the overall direction of Professor John Goddard.
These groups will be particularly concerned with the technical issues that arise in the integration and analysis of spatial data in the environmental as well as the socio-economic field.

The Northern Regional Research Laboratory, based at the Universities of Lancaster and Newcastle, is directed by Professor John Goddard of CURDS.
The Newcastle team extends beyond the one full-time RRL researcher to involve 10 other academics in CURDS and 3 other Departments of the University.
The programme of research is focused around three topics: technical aspects of geographical information system (GIS) technology, a number of demonstrator projects as ‘show-piece’ GISs, and perhaps a pilot data library for the North of England.
One distinctive theme of the Newcastle RRL work is the problem of integrating zonal datasets--in other words, bringing together information that was published for different sets of areas (over 50 different sets of areas are used for reporting statistics about Britain's localities).
Bringing data on to one or more common sets of areas allows much fuller use of the information.
As the resulting data estimates may not always be 100% accurate, an important part of the research involves measuring typical levels of error that result.
Among the areas of technical interest is the evaluation of GIS software when used with zonal datasets, particularly since this form of information is far more common in the social sciences and ‘the real world’ than are the digital mapping and remote sensing datasets for which GIS is most highly developed so far.
The RRL will focus on user needs and develop techniques that are policy relevant.
As a key element in this strategy, a small number of ‘demonstrator projects’ will integrate socio-economic data with a user's own distinctive data, whether it be on the environment, health, crime or from market research.
In addition, the RRL will develop contacts with many potentially interested private and public sector organisations, and offer a series of workshops to advertise the relevancy of social science technology in this area.
This award forms part of the Regional Research Laboratories initiative (reference H/11).

The decline of employment in manufacturing industry, and continued job creation in services, has increased interest in the latter.
Despite this increased concern a combination of intractable conceptual problems, inadequate statistical coverage and fragmented empirical work have limited the understanding of the location of services.
A working party was set up under the auspices of the Institute of British Geographers, and their work is being expanded by support from ESRC.
The working party focuses on producer services, that is, private commercial services serving markets in business, commerce and the public sector.
Producer services are tradeable; unlike many services they are not tied to local population and income levels, and as a consequence they contribute to spatial variations in service employment.
The working party outlines the extent, character and location of job creation in services.
It defines producer services, and by reviewing existing research produces a better understanding of their role and growth.
A framework for the analysis of the location of producer services is being produced.
Case studies of locational change in selected producer services are being carried out, and the implications of the results for urban and regional policies are being considered.
A list of research priorities will be produced.

There is varied evidence that suggests that major geographical moves, either between or within countries, not only have a disruptive effect on people's lives, but may produce lasting changes.
Geographical moves have been found to be third most important in a list of ten precipitants concentrated in the month before the onset of depressive symptoms, in forty consecutive clinically depressed patients.
In addition, those who move frequently have been found to have increased risk for some forms of both chronic and infectious disease.
The project is concerned with examining the effects of a major geographical move on the individual in terms of psychological state, health, and efficiency, with specific emphasis on students who leave home to take a place at either university or boarding school.
The important point about this category of moves, is that the ‘home’ remains in existence and a person is required to establish a new life elsewhere.
Preliminary studies have suggested that a high proportion of first year students experience homesickness.
The intensity of the experience varies greatly.
In some cases, the condition is debilitating and not unlike grief or depression.
Daily efficiency may be affected and bouts of preoccupation lead to difficulties in concentration.
The main concern of the project is to collect evidence about the incidence of homesickness, to examine daily work efficiency in affected individuals and to explore the main features of reported bouts of homesickness.
Comparisons with those who do not report homesickness will provide a basis for understanding differences in attitude and adjustment to a new environment.

The project will lead to an official history of the Town and Country Planning Association between 1946 and 1986.
The Association has a long history (dating back to the end of the last century), and the ESRC funded project will complement existing work on the period before 1946.
In its early days the Association was primarily concerned with campaigning for garden cities.
This new form of settlement (incorporating the best of town and country) was seen as a way of relieving congestion in the major cities and of providing a better environment for ordinary people.
As a direct outcome of this campaign, two garden cities were built, the first at Letchworth and the second at Welwyn.
Although these depended for their success on voluntary support, the Association went on to lobby for new towns sponsored by the State.
Partly as a result of this lobbying, the British new towns programme was launched in 1946, with towns like Harlow and Stevenage in the first batch.
The Association has continued to be active since 1946, monitoring the progress of new towns and seeking to further the principles and practice of good planning.
As a research project there is a dual attraction.
The first is that an understanding of the history of the Association promises to yield an interesting perspective on the wider process of town and country planning since the Second World War.
The second attraction is that the Town and Country Planning Association is a fascinating case study of a pressure group that has been active over a long period.
As such, it is intended to draw wider lessons about the workings of pressure groups in modern Britain.

Much social and medical research is concerned with the impact of certain experiences or treatments on the subsequent behaviour of a group of individuals.
Only rarely is it possible to observe these impacts within a well designed ‘experiment’.
More often it is necessary to identify their effects from survey data obtained from a panel, or sample of individuals followed over time, or from an interview recording the histories of individuals as they recall them.
Such data require special methods of analysis, particularly to account for the influence of omitted, possibly unmeasurable factors, which affect behaviour.
For example, the failure to account for such characteristics as ‘frailty’, which vary from individual to individual, can lead to systematic exaggeration of the benefits of medical treatments.
Likewise, the failure to account for varying degrees of personal ‘inertia’ may lead to an incorrect assessment of the role of unemployment in migration.
A variety of statistical procedures will be explored, which are appropriate to the analysis of such longitudinal data and which overcome this problem of omitted factors, amongst others.
Analyses will be undertaken using these methods to identify some of the important factors determining migration and employment behaviour in the British Isles.

This project is concerned with decisions about the choice of home and job, and related decisions about travelling to work, by those who work in South East England.
In the project, a number of data sources are being utilised; in particular, recently available data from the 1981 Census of Population and the 1981 British Rail Origin-Destination Survey are being compared with earlier data to obtain a picture of recent trends.
Data collected in the course of the recently completed project on the relationship between rail fares and locational decisions are being used to explain these trends.
The greater understanding of the behaviour of commuters and the long term trends are being synthesised with information on the policies of transport operators and central and local government so that the influence of policy, such as that in the 1980 Transport Act, on the long-term trends can be better understood.

The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 establishes that, for the present, environmental goals in the farmed countryside are to be achieved primarily through management agreements and the self-regulation of farming practice by the farming community.
Yet we have little detailed knowledge of how individual farm businesses and their associated patterns of occupancy are changing or how these changes influence those farm management decisions that lead to alterations to the agricultural landscape.
The primary purpose of this research is to develop a methodology capable of analysing these complex interrelated issues, focusing in particular on the economic pressures created by the handing on of the business from father to son and from the purchase of land.
The empirical work will build on previous research conducted in London's Green Belt, not only because the amenity value of agricultural land in the urban fringe is important to local residents but also because the poor maintenance of farmland is used as an argument for relaxing green belt restraint.
It is intended to establish a number of management strategies that are commonly followed by farmers in the Green Belt and from an analysis of these strategies to develop a broader perspective on the relations between land occupancy and land management that is applicable to other farming situations.

Green spaces in and around London are under constant threat from developers and difficult decisions about their future use have to be faced by public authorities.
This study will focus on the informal uses of parks, farmland and waste land and the amenity values these areas may have for the general public.
Previous studies have assessed the amenity role of countryside open-spaces using separate ecological, landscape and recreational criteria.
In this study, judgements about the amenity values of open-spaces are explored in an urban setting and in the expectation that values will represent combinations of social and cultural attachments.
The research uses a variety of social survey methods.
In-depth discussion groups with local residents are used to explore what features of different open-areas people like or dislike and to find out how these assessments relate to personal and social characteristics and to where people live.
The findings of these discussions will be included in a household survey to establish how widely these preferences and prejudices are held by the general community.
A similar survey of planners and managers of open spaces is being conducted.
The purpose of the surveys is to expose consensus and conflicts about popular values for green spaces close to the city.

Recent research in the Transport Studies Group has shown how information available for transport planning in large cities can be used to measure accessibility to employment for different kinds of people with and without cars.
The resulting method can be applied to any small area to measure either number of jobs accessible to people living there, or numbers of workers to whom jobs are accessible.
Information about journeys actually made by people of a given kind is used to assess what journeys to work are acceptable to such people by various means of transport.
This technique was applied to data from the 1981 Greater London Transportation Survey, which were just becoming available, and the corresponding 1971 survey.
Changes in accessibility between 1971 and 1981 were compared with concurrent changes in employment.
In consultation with GLC staff, attention was given to parts of London where changes over the decade were especially relevant to foreseeable issues of transport and planning policy, such as possible changes in transport or the location of homes and jobs.
Technical improvements to the method of measuring accessibility were also investigated.

Increased spatial polarisation of the British electorate since 1955 is frequently remarked upon: it is usually associated with what is commonly referred to as a growing north:south divide, and sometimes with a growing urban:rural division too.
Reasons for this increased polarisation have yet to be made explicit, however.
The first part of this research will develop a novel statistical methodology, which combines census, electoral and survey data, so that we can evaluate the relative importance of three possible causes of the polarisation: the changing social structure of the population in different regions; the impact of the growth of parties other than Conservative and Labour; and variations in voting behaviour between people in defined social groups but living in different regions.
The second part of the work will look at spatial variations in political attitudes and their links to both individual social attributes and voting behaviour.
Survey data collected over the last three decades will be re-analysed to see whether changes in the geography of economic and social well-being in Great Britain have led to either or both of changed political attitudes and changed partisan allegiances.
Recent trends in the geography of voting in Great Britain pose major problems for all political parties as they develop strategies for the next general election.
This research will illuminate those trends, and contribute not only to debates about changing pattern of voting behaviour but also likely political futures.

The research investigates the implications of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which makes provision for the revaluation of all non-domestic properties in England and Wales for rating purposes, and the application of a national uniform business rate to replace the rate-in-the-pound currently set by individual local authorities.
The revaluation is currently underway and will be the first comprehensive national revision of valuation lists since 1973.
It is predicted that these changes will result in significance shifts in the rating burden.
The primary concern of this research is the effect of rates on the rental and capital value of retail property, and the location pattern of rental activity.
This will require examination of the dynamics of local property markets, and of those factors which influence value generally.
A case study will be undertaken in Nottingham to build on existing research.
A partial reassessment of rateable values took place there in 1986, to reflect changes in existing shopping patterns caused primarily be the development of two major shopping centres in the city.
This affords an opportunity to study effects of unanticipated changes in rateable values and enables comparisons to be made between properties where rates have increased, reduced or remained static.
Data will be collected on retail property development and transactions in the area, and survey work will be undertaken to identify the perceived effects of change in rates.
Wherever possible, the results will be compared with other cities where similar situations have arisen.
Although the study will focus on retail property in Nottingham, it is expected to reveal principles which are applicable to other non- domestic property sectors and other locations.
The results should assist in anticipating and understanding the implications of the rating reforms due in April 1990.
More generally, they will contribute to research on the detailed operation of local property markets
The study is jointly financed by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Education Trust and is due to report prior to the implementation of the new valuation list in 1990.

While the impact of deep recession after 1979 on the conurbations and inner cities has been widely recognised and researched, far less is known about conditions in those labour markets outside the main cities where one or two dominant companies have declared major redundancy programmes in the course of restructuring.
This research project focuses upon three dominated labour markets in the North West of England where mass redundancy is a relatively new phenomenon.
Preston-Leyland-Chorley has suffered the effects of major redundancies from closures by such key firms as Courtaulds and Seddon-Atkinson, while job losses at Leyland Vehicles continue to be declared.
Northwich-Winsford in mid-Cheshire has had a long record of stable employment provided by companies like ICI and Foden.
Recently, closures and redundancies have begun to have a serious impact.
Finally, Pilkingtons in St Helens, thought of as a one-company town, has seen the successful application of float glass technology, but recently large scale redundancy has had devastating consequences on local employment.
For all of these cases, the project seeks to explore the nature of the restructuring processes at the level of the dominant firms, the internal processes of occupational re-allocation and the knock-on effects of the shocks generated by major redundancy programmes.
The research takes an ‘'in-depth'’ approach to the evaluation of labour market adjustments to major short-term changes in labour demand and from the supply-side seeks to identify the gainers and losers in a process where a declining pool of jobs is being re-allocated across a local population expelling some from work but more insidiously excluding others willing and able to participate but denied access.

The project investigates the national and regional consequences of recent changes in the structure of the UK car component industry.
The UK car component industry has been undergoing severe contraction owing to the rationalisation strategies of UK assemblers and the increasing tendency for foreign-owned assemblers to supply the market through imports.
Franchised distribution channels also effectively exclude many UK manufacturers from large sections of the replacement parts markets.
In effect, this has forced many small to medium-sized component manufacturers out of business and encouraged larger manufacturers to internationalise their operations so that they can supply assembly plants overseas.
This has often been at the expense of existing capacity in the United Kingdom.
It is difficult to say whether rationalisation resulting from these processes will be most pronounced in the traditional regions, such as the West Midlands and South East, or in the slower growing regions of the UK periphery, where low technology mass production units may be extremely vulnerable to closure owing to increased levels of import penetration.
The research attempts to provide an answer to this question by means of a blanket survey of all manufacturing establishments in the industry with a follow-up in depth interview survey of selected case studies.

The central aim of the Laboratory will be to identify, describe and provide access to data and information related to the Midlands.
The systems developed will link economic, social and environmental data.
This work will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team from both Leicester and Loughborough Universities in collaboration with research staff at the British Geological Survey and neighbouring local authorities.
Four related projects concerned with service provision, the assembly and enhancement of data and information and systems development are proposed: i) The creation of a Midlands data base specifically designed to meet the expressed requirements of data and information users in the region.
ii) The development of a human computer interface which will allow users to find out about sources of data and information.
iii) A system that will make possible the integration of economic, social and environmental data thereby adding greatly to the value of each component data element.
iv) A system that will, by assisting in automating map scale change, help solve one of the main problems in computer cartography.

One of the most significant changes in the national economy over the last thirty years has been the shift in employment from the manufacturing sector to the service sector and the associated growth in female employment.
This shift, however, has had a geographically uneven impact, both between and within the economic planning regions.
The research is designed to investigate the changing organisation of service sector employment nationally, the particular impact of its expansion in East Anglia, where rates of growth have been above the national average, and to establish the consequence of this growth for class and gender relations in the two local labour markets of Norwich and Ipswich.
National and regional patterns of change will be established primarily from official statistics whereas the principal methodology in Norwich and Ipswich will be interview surveys of a sample of employers and employees within the service sector.

The M4 Corridor, stretching from Heathrow airport to Bristol is one of the most prosperous parts of Britain and has become a favoured location for electronics firms.
At present, there is considerable speculation about developments in the Corridor but little hard evidence.
The research analyses the nature and performance of the electronics industry in the area and assesses its contribution to the development of the Corridor.
Particular attention is being paid to the following: the competitive position of the firms; the specific type of work carried out in the M4 plants; the quantity and quality of employment provided; composition of the workforce and skill requirements; links between firms and research establishments in the area.
The research also assesses the advantages and disadvantages of the area for electronics firms.
Initial studies of the performance and prospects of the industrial sectors in which the firms are involved are being followed up by in-depth interviews with managers in about 30 plants.

Three related projects comprise this research programme, each of which explores some aspect of contemporary change and development in British society as it is reflected in, and affected by, different kinds of local areas.
One project which is already under way, is looking at the impact of new ‘high technology’ industry along the M4 Corridor, and the focus here is on the relationship between new industrial methods, local labour markets and changing patterns of social life.
A second project will consider the way in which housing supply relates to different conditions found in different local areas eg land availability, the political complexion of local councils, and so on.
The third project will investigate how the growth of owner-occupation may have different implications, economically, politically and socially, among different groups living in different parts of the country according to variations in local housing markets, employment situations, cultural forms, and so on.
The common objective behind all three projects is to analyse how changes in the society as a whole have a different impact in different areas, such that the same process may come to have very different consequences according to local-level variations.
In this way, it should be possible to evaluate policy options more carefully than hitherto by identifying the sorts of factors which are likely to intervene between a national-level change and its actual effects ‘on the ground’ in different areas.

The project seeks to develop theory and understanding about the behaviour of urban land prices in low and middle-income residential districts of contemporary Third World cities.
Little is known about the key processes which fix land values and lead to land valorisation as urban development occurs.
Nor are there rigourous analyses of the impact upon urban land values of speculative land development by private agents, and the effects of contemporary public policies such as legalisation of individual plot titles; the provision of urban services and utilities; cadastral registration, and betterment taxation.
These interventions shape the nature of land price behaviour, changing land uses, and population displacement of the poorest groups.
The study proposes to conduct fieldwork in tow intermediate size cities in Central Mexico.
It will combine a ‘macro’ approach investigating the practices and involvement of elites and public officials in financing urban development, and construction and real estate industries, and in planning and undertaking urban infrastructure provision.
At the ‘micro’ level information will be gathered at the household and plot level about land values and land price changes, together with an evaluation of population turnover.
The Cambridge based project forms the ‘umbrella’ to wider collaborative research in which several independently financed groups will work in other countries using a similar methodology to address the same issues.
This will allow wider generalisations to be drawn.

In the long term, the supply of land is as critical to industrial performance as the supply of labour and capital.
At present, relatively little is known about the workings of industrial land markets in comparison with the more sophisticated understanding of labour and capital markets.
Preliminary research however indicates that the actual availability of land is limited by a combination of valuation, ownership, physical and planning constraints.
These may not only reduce industrial competitiveness but are also likely to influence the location of industry, since spatial variations in the distribution of the constraints do exist.
This may help to explain the decentralisation of manufacturing industry from inner cities to outer areas,
The aim of the research will be to investigate the existence and impact of these constraints in depth, by looking at one fairly extensive area in the North-West.
By doing so, it is hoped to develop a far better understanding of how industrial land markets work in practice.
Particular attention will be paid to whether the markets serve the needs of industry, how they influence industrial location and what practical steps may need to be taken to improve market performance.

During the last few years there has been growing concern over the effects of sharp regional variations in house prices on the mobility of labour.
It has been argued that high house prices have prevented workers from moving to new jobs in the South East, leading to recruitment difficulties and increased costs for employers in the region.
There is now considerable understanding of the supply aspects of housing provision, but the formation of housing demand is less well understood.
This project aims to investigate the way the labour and housing markets interact in a ‘boom’ region in the South East (Berkshire) by using a sample survey of the local workforce.
This will provide a detailed picture of the housing choices and constraints of households in an area characterised by extremely high house prices.
These may include multiple or shared house ownership, a hitherto under- researched issue.

In October 1989 the government approved the funding of Phase 1 of Metrolink, Greater Manchester's proposed light rail system.
Construction has started and the system should be operational by late 1991.
Phase 1 will enable trains on the existing Altrincham and Bury lines to reach the heart of the city centre (Piccadilly Gardens) using surface lines and also continue to Piccadilly station.
The aim of the system is to enable travellers to reach the core of the city centre by rail systems in a way that is not possible now, to facilitate movements across the city centre and thus across the city, to persuade travellers to shift from car travel to public transport thus relieving road congestion, and to facilitate the revitalisation of the city centre.
The research will monitor and evaluate the success of metrolink by comparing the actual with the expected results using the statements of justification and by comparing the actual with the counterfactual position.
In addition to monitoring trends the research will involve before and after surveys.

The study examines the impact of recent business reorganisation on the location of service employment in GB.
Research during the 1970s showed that the concentration of service employment in southern Britain was related to the increasing dominance in the economy of large multi-site companies with their head office, administration and associated satellite suppliers near London.
More recent evidence suggests this picture is too simplistic.
Recession, changes in business practice and the introduction of new technology have brought about a major reorganisation of service production within business.
This study uses directory sources to provide information on the largest companies in GB.
A questionnaire survey of 20 of these companies highlights differences in the location of their service activities, and explores the reasons for this.
Case studies of three examples of corporate reorganisation consider the way in which corporate structures have changed during the last two decades, and the implications of this for the geography of service production.

One of the dominant themes in the redistribution of population in the Western World over the past twenty years or so has been the dispersal of population from large cities to medium and small-sized settlements.
It is the purpose of this research project to investigate the mechanisms of the decision-making process underpinning the migration of households into that part of rural Britain lying immediately beyond the South East Regional Planning Region (SERPLAN), which, according to all recent population censuses and estimates, is a belt of sustained and substantial population growth.
Achievement of this objective will permit a clearer understanding of the patterns and processes of population change in pressured rural areas, particularly within a contemporary context of accelerating land and property prices, both in absolute terms and relative to urban areas.
Furthermore the research will provide an informed statement about the origins, composition and behavioural characteristics of migrant households which will be a major benefit to policy makers concerned with the provision of rural housing and local services.
These and related issues will be examined by compiling a data base of secondary and documentary material as well as by social surveys at district and village levels.

‘Land settlement’, or the opening up of ‘new’ lands for agriculture, appeals to many governments.
It rarely achieves its objectives in creating jobs or increasing production, and it contributes significantly to the tropical deforestation which is a current world concern.
It is essential that sustainable agriculture be developed in the areas already deforested and settled.
Writing on land settlement is much preoccupied with men; women rarely feature although they make up half the population.
It is now understood that in the process land settlement women often lose property rights, access to income, freedom of movement and social support.
Sustainable development will depend on a more positive incorporation of women settlers.
This project will investigate the roles of males and females, old and young, and the power relations between them in two areas of land settlement in Mexico where there are attempts at sustainable agriculture.
It will use a sample survey and a life history approach.
The project forms part of continuing research into gender in land settlement in tropical Latin America.

The approach of the twenty-first century makes it more imperative that we consider the cumulative effect of human activities on the Global Environment.
The role of the social sciences in programmes which address Global Environmental Change (GEC) is vital, but scarcely ever understood.
Natural scientists have been giving increasing attention to GEC, both nationally and internationally, but many of the questions confronting policymakers and citizens can only be answered through research in the social sciences.
We need to fully understand human interventions in natural systems, including climate and ecology.
We need to strike a balance between responding to the impacts of Global Change and preventing Global Environmental Change in the first place.
Our knowledge of the Global Environment is couched in scientific uncertainty: but policymakers will wish to Act before there is definitive ‘proof’ of GEC.
In collaboration with the other UK Research Councils and with international bodies and the European Community, the Economic and Social Research Council is undertaking the first phase of its Global Environmental Change Initiative.
This will take social science concerns to the heart of Global Change, and bring Global concerns to the heart of the social sciences.
The GEC Initiative is expected to account for one-third of total social science spending in the l990s.
A GEC Centre will be established at University College and the University of East Anglia in July 1991.

In recent years, Zambia has received a growing number of refugees from the continuing civil war in Mozambique.
By early 1990, it was estimated that as many as 30,000 Mozambicans were accommodated in the Ukwimi refugee settlement, in Eastern Province.
It is often assumed that because of the vulnerable status of many refugees, such a mass influx places an immense burden on the receiving area's economy.
However, recent work carried out elsewhere in Southern Africa shows that a complex set of economic and social linkages has emerged between refugees and their host populations.
Other studies in Africa as a whole suggest that rural migrants may even act as catalysts in rural development.
The aim of this project is therefore to analyse the agricultural and employment strategies of both refugees and their rural hosts, in order to examine their responses the experience of refugee migration, and their impact on the host country.
Data collection should be of immediate practical in the formulation and evaluation of assistance programmes in Zambia.
The work will also contribute to a theoretical understanding of survival strategies and the dynamics of decision-making in conditions of forced migration.
The project has the support of the Zambian Government, and is part of a wider investigation into displacement in Southern Africa, being carried out in the Department of Geography at King's College London and the Refugee Studies Programme of the University of Oxford.
Additional funds for travel on this project have been provided by the Hayter Fund of the University of London.

France's Afro-Caribbean population forms a distinctive element in post-war migrant labour recruitment: of French nationality, with an equal balance of men and women, and strongly concentrated in public sector employment, especially in the Paris region.
State policy strongly influenced the migration flow from the Caribbean islands, especially from the early 1960s.
This project looks at aspects of the migrants' housing experience, using aggregate statistics to establish general tenure patterns and interviews to recreate biographical histories.
We investigate the extent to which Afro-Caribbean migrants avoided the worst excesses of the housing crisis of the 1960s and 1970s, looking in detail at housing conditions for newly-arrived migrants.
Research then focusses on access to the public housing sector, in order to reveal whether the role of the state was less direct (specifically aimed at the Caribbean population through the migration agency) than indirect (through the role of employers and the general involvement of the state in housing provision).
The project forms a part of a larger project investigating the history of French migration policy in the Caribbean and the pattern of settlement and employment in metropolitan France.

There has recently been considerable discussion in the social science literature relating to questions of industrial transformation.
This discussion has cut across the boundaries of economics, geography and sociology.
At the same time, there has also been a sometimes quite heated public debate about the impacts of inward investment from Japan within the European Community and North America.
In both debates, terms such as flexibility and post-Fordism have loomed large and the automobile industry has frequently figured prominently in both and strong claims are made as to innovatory and transformatory effects of developments in vehicle manufacture and design.
Often, however, theoretical arguments have been distanced from detailed empirical investigation of industrial change.
This project will help provide a more coherent basis for theorizations of such changes and of the impacts of Japanese investment via detailed case studies of selected automobile companies and plants within France, Germany and the UK.
These studies will be based upon plant visits and in-depth interviews with managers, trades unionists and decision makers within local and national governments and within the EC.
In this way, the detailed picture of European automobile production and its significance for national and regional economies will be illustrated.
Particular attention will be given to issues relating to ‘flexible specialization’ and to the processes whereby and the extent to which ‘just-in-time’production systems have been ‘exported’from Japan.
In this, contrasts and comparisons will be made between (and within) the practices of US, EC and Japanese corporations.
The investigators on this project have worked together on a range of industrial and economic development projects in recent years.
All have considerable experience of international comparative research.
Huw Beynon is Professor of Sociology at the University of Manchester.
His highly influential study ‘Working for Ford’, was published in 1973 and over the succeeding years he has continued his studies of the changing strategies of multinational corporation in a variety of different contexts.
Ray Hudson is Professor of Geography at the University of Durham.
He has written or edited twelve books, mainly examining relationships between industrial change and regional and national economies.
His most recent book, ‘Wrecking a region’, provides a detailed and pathbreaking historical analysis of these issues in the north east of England.
Andrew Mair is Research Fellow at the University of Durham.
Recently returned to the UK, from the USA, he was there centrally involved in an innovatory research project investigating the impact and practices of Japanese car corporation.
His publications raise crucial questions as to the links between ‘just-in-time’, technology and regional labour markets.
David Sadler is Lecturer in Geography at the University of Durham.
He has been involved in several research projects relating to the spatial impacts of industrial organisation and change within the UK and EC.
His forthcoming book, ‘Economic restructuring, state policies and regional crisis’, makes a significant contribution to the analysis of the connections between sectoral and spatial change.

The aim of the research is to examine how the right to buy policy has affected the Afro Caribbean community.
Council housing has emerged as the main form of tenure of the Afro Caribbean population of Great Britain.
Currently nearly half of private households headed by a person of Afro Caribbean ethnic origin (or nearly twice the proportion of the total population) lives in a dwelling rented from the local authority.
Between 1979 and 1990, 1,250,000 council houses, or about 20 per cent of the total stock, was sold to sitting tenants.
It is now clear how this policy will have affected the Afro Caribbean population.
Generally, it is thought that because they are disproportionately found in the hard to let properties, that they will have neither the means nor the desire to buy.
However, not all West Indians are concentrated in such areas and the concept of the ghettoised underclass, while popular, is perhaps less widely applicable than asserted.
The project will measure the extent to which the right to buy has been exercised by the Afro Caribbean population.
The research forms part of the ethnic geography research group at Oxford University.

During the last decade, the international trade in conventional weapons has almost doubled in volume every five years.
Approximately three-quarters of this trade consists of deliveries from industrial countries to the Third World.
The aim of the research project is to provide a detailed examination of the geographical structure of arms transfer to the Third World for the period 1970-1980.
A major component of the project will involve the development of a suitable methodology for the analysis and monitoring of such transfers which hitherto has been lacking.
It is proposed that Atkins Q-analysis provides the basis for such an analysis; the principal source of data will be that collected by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
The results of the research will be of more than purely academic interest, insofar as the rigorous identification and description of the structure of the arms trade would appear to be a necessary prerequisite for any discussion of multi-lateral restraints.

Since the early sixteenth century it has been known that North American Indians and Inuits made maps.
Rock art evidence suggests that they had done so in pre-historic times.
In every part of the continent white explorers and settlers observed the making and use of maps for indigenous purposes.
They also received geographical information from native people in map form.
Native and European made maps were both used in the course of negotiations between natives and whites.
Extant examples of maps date from 1602 and there are contemporary accounts of mapping and the use of maps from considerably earlier.
Until recently, however, native maps and mapping have tended to be treated as curiosities and in very narrow contexts.
Most case are still essentially unknown.
This project has three objectives: seeking links between the vocabularies and grammars of native languages and geometry and content of maps; investigating native-white misunderstandings arising from the use of maps in negotiating, implementing and contesting land treaties; and compiling and making available four data sets: contemporary accounts of native maps, mapping and map use; native methods for representing distance, direction and distribution; extant native maps (including examples supposedly included in rock art); and incorporations of native information on European and Euro-American maps.
The terminal data for the data sets will be 1920.
The project will involve working in North America as well as the United Kingdom.

Over the past few years it has become increasingly evident that the UK is witnessing a transformation in dominant household forms.
It has been argued that the conventional ‘male breadwinner’ earning a ‘family wage’is being superseded by a new convention in which both male and female partners spend the major part of their potential working lives in employment.

Implementing a recommendation of a House of Lords Science and Technology Committee (1984) that more attention should be paid to overlap between agricultural and environmental research, three research councils (AFRC: ESRC: NERC) established the Joint Agriculture and the Environment Programme (JAEP).
JAEP consists of three strands: 1.
Plant — Herbivore Interaction administered by AFRC 2.
Farmland Ecology administered by NERC 3.
Changing Farm Economies for which ESRC is responsible.
In the Changing Farm Economies element, eight research topics were commissioned of which four were concerned with the multiple job holding in farm families in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Europe, two were concerned with modelling different aspects of land use and two were concerned with investigating responses to various policies.
A very wide variety of researchers are involved.
The research grant enables coordination to be carried out between the groups, promotes contact and information exchange and enables organisation dissemination activity.

The growing popularity of British purchases of French housing is clear from weekend newspaper adverts, specialist magazines and estate agents for this market and, in France, the emergence of ‘agences immobilieres’ to respond to this demand.
Journalists have made various estimates of the extent of British purchases, but the geographical spread (of buyers and purchases) and processes of house acquisition are little understood.
This project aims to investigate the operations of estate agents and purchasers, in order to examine both supply and demand aspects of house purchase.
Estate agents will be interviewed to identify how properties are identified and marketed, and a sample survey of purchasers will examine reasons for site and house choice.
An additional aspect of the study is to identify the manner in which British buyers use their French properties (as second-homes, for rent as a holiday home, for retirement, as a new permanent home, etc) and to consider the reactions of local communities to an influx of British home owners.
At least two departments in France will be focussed on for the detailed investigation of home owners.
The investigation of estate agents will examine conditions and practices in a variety of regions in France.

The aim of this project is to sponsor and develop a series of workshops aimed at reporting, discussing and promoting the development of applied geographical information systems (GIS) in the academic and commercial worlds.
Because the environment in which GIS operates is constantly changing (in terms of software, hardware and the relationships between academic and non-academic practitioners) it is important that leading players are brought together to share experiences, to report on new application areas and to promote the communication between academic researchers and the end-users of GIS products.
More specifically, the workshops aim to address issues such as the development and evaluation of new GIS products, new areas of application, the problems and benefits of forging partnerships with non-academics, the need for greater analytical techniques in GIS (particularly spatial modelling) and assessments of the market.
The project build on considerable experience of applied GIS: the School of Geography at the University of Leeds has been at the forefront of international developments in applied geographical modelling and through GMAP (Geographical Modelling and Planning) Ltd. is now applying its unique state of the art approach in many varied business and planning environments.

The Sahel zone of West Africa experienced intense drought during the early 1970s, which caused much hardship for and dislocation of the agropastoral communities — who combine farming with livestock — in the region.
In the early 1980s, there was another severe drought cycle but the adverse impact was less.
The study will focus on the adaptive strategies used by these communities, how they are changing, and their capabilities to withstand an increased frequency of drought in future.
An area in north-east Nigeria for which information is available over several decades, beginning in 1950, will be the locus of the study.
Climatic, land use, water, soil and other data will be assembled to construct a profile of environmental change over time.
Village level interviews will be conducted in depth in order to identify household behaviour patterns and survival strategies, and to determine whether these strategies are sustainable.
The Universities of Kano and Maiduguri will collaborate in the project, and the EC-funded North East Arid Zone Development Programme is expected to give technical cooperation.
Nigerian research assistants will work under the direction of Mr. Michael Mortimore.
Results from the study are expected to show how adaptable the indigenous agro-pastoral systems are in the face of adverse climatic changes which may affect the Sahel as a consequence of global warming.

The revolutions in Eastern Europe have paved the way for the dismantling of state socialist systems and have initiated a period of transition towards the re-establishment of a market economy.
In Romania the legacy of the late President Ceausescu's National Stalinism' will persist for a considerable time and the directions of change cannot easily be predicted.
The research will investigate trends i the rural areas of Romania with particular reference to the Carpathians, dealing with migration in the light of changes in employment structures (especially agriculture, forestry and rural industry).
Studies will deal with various mountain regions and Romanian experience will set against trends in the Carpathian regions of other Eastern European countries.

The research investigates the problems created for an individual region of the UK by the cumulative impact of industrial and other investment upon its physical environment.
It seeks to clarify the relationship between regional development, environmental impact and policies — including pollution control policies as well as those concerned with economic development and physical planning.
It aims to elaborate the concept of Best Practicable Environmental Option at the regional scale.
How might a region utilize BPEO?
The region for study is greater Humberside, which has developed an unusual concentration of activities with potentially heavy pollution impacts upon land, air and water.
Its location in the North Sea Basin gives its special significance in relation to the European arena and international pollution concerns.
There are two major components to the study.
The first is a regional ‘pollution audit’ which will identify pollution sources, levels and trends on Humberside across all media, and identify those localities most at risk.
The second component is a review and analysis of policies at local, national and international scales and their impact on pollution levels, and of the regional environmental implications of the investment strategies of key industries.

It is generally agreed the potential of geographic information systems (GIS) is considerable.
However, there is increasing concern as to the extent human, institutional and organisational factors will inhibit the take up and utilisation of GIS.
There are already considerable differences in the experiences of even similar types of organisations.
The research will explore the impact of GIS on local government as this is one of the largest groups of users.
The project aims to assess the problems and benefits associated with system implementation and to evaluate the impact of GIS on the development of corporate activities within local government.
A comprehensive survey of British local authorities will be complemented by detailed case studies.
Provision is made for a follow- up survey to monitor changes during the period of the project.
The survey design will take account of work being conducted in the United States as the basis for a comparative evaluation of British and American experiences.
The research findings will provide empirical information on one of the key issues identified by the Chorley Report, and indicate possible strategies for resolving the difficulties being encountered in practice.
The project will therefore add to practical as well as theoretical understanding of the impacts of GIS.

The principal objective of this project is to carry out research to help build an intelligent geographical database system.
We intend to develop an object-based paradigm for the processing of geographical data types, within a relational framework.
In particular, this project seeks to develop a single data model in which attribute and topographic geometry are stored under the same relational architecture — so avoiding many of the shortcomings of systems utilising independent structures for attribute data and their spatial references.
It is proposed that the oracle database management system will be used for such purpose.
Our approach to the project will concentrate to some large extent upon the identification of underlying object classes in order to develop an object-oriented model.
In so doing we will be addressing a major research issue — that of determination of possible relationships between spatial objects and the operations which act upon them.

Since 1979, local government has been under increasing pressure to consider ways in which the private sector could run services previously provided by the public sector.
Many councils have investigated, and some have actually pursued, such policies of privatisation, or contracting out.
The research will provide a comprehensive illustration of the national context of privatisation through a consideration of the services and local authorities involved.
This will provide a basis for an analysis of the main characteristics of privatisation decisions, and processes of public accountability.
The work will primarily involve the delivery and analysis of a survey of all local authorities.
In the later stages, a sample of local government and trade union officials from representative local authorities will be interviewed.
The research as a whole will provide the vital national framework against which individual privatisation decisions can be considered.

The Irish are the largest, but least visible, ethnic minority in Britain and, unusually, women substantially outnumber men.
Their crucial contribution to the labour force, particularly in the areas of nursing and cleaning/catering service work, is rarely acknowledged.
Specific problems faced by Irish women are also overlooked and demand attention.
The research aims to uncover and examine Irish women's migration to Britain in the post-War period.
This movement has involved more than a million women, including British born daughters.
The study focusses on the economic and social consequences both for women themselves and the societies in which they have settled.
Statistical analysis of census and Labour Force data will provide detailed information about changing patterns of settlement, employment and housing at national and regional scales.
These findings will be compared with the experiences of white UK-born and other ethnic groups.
As yet links between gender and ethnicity are little understood.
What does ‘Irishness’ mean for women and men?
How is it experienced by Irish women in different parts of Britain?
A small number of in-depth interviews will explore these themes.
The project should provide a framework within which individual experiences can be located nd broader policy initiatives formulated.

Over the past 12 years, a series of large scale surveys of the British mechanical engineering industry have been carried out at CURDS.
These surveys have recorded the adoption of a number of new technologies over time for a consistent set of manufacturing establishments, providing a unique source of data on the history and patterns of technological change in this important sector of industry.
The objectives of this research project are to assimilate and synthesise the data from all three surveys to provide an update of the regional and sectoral patterns of new technology diffusion between 1981 and 1993.
The research will involve identifying the current (ie whether in business or not) of all the non-respondents to the most recent survey in order to check for bias in the results.
The raw data will be cleaned up to remove inconsistencies and ambiguities between the different surveys.
Appropriate statistical models will be developed to test the accuracy of forecasts of technology adoption patterns made in the mid-1980s; to provide an analysis of the geographical patterns of technology diffusion in relation to the performance of the manufacturing establishments; and to relate the survival patterns of the establishments to their history of technology adoption.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer software systems for storing and displaying geographical data.
Such systems are excellent for producing maps and currently contribute to the management of geographic information but their analytical functions are weak.
Health authorities handle large volumes of postcoded information.
Within the health service there is an established but still growing interest in the use of such data ti contribute to an understanding of the geographical patterns of disease incidence and to contribute to more general issues of health service resource targeting.
While GIS has great potential to contribute to these problems, this potential will only be realised if the data analysis functions of these systems can be extended.
Research has already shown that GIS can be extended to include data analysis and this project will develop the following analytical capability: the ability to construct health regions; the ability to compute rates (eg disease rates) in differing geographical areas, the ability to provide a wide range of descriptive statistical summaries both of the overall data and specific geographical areas.
particular importance will be attached to providing good methods of displaying results.
However, the limits to the extension of GIS into data analysis are still to be determined.
This project will also consider the extent to which GIS can support the special needs of spatial data analysis.

The late 1980s was a period of rapid growth in the national economy accompanied by important associated changes in the location and levels of office development, house building, retailing and industrial development.
In some instances this growth was clearly evident in the office building boom seen in many city centres, but a large part of the commercial, housing, retail and industrial development was located in much smaller towns, often some distance away from the larger conurbations.
Until quite recently it has not been possible to track the land use implications of such economic and social changes in any detail.
Using detailed measures of land use change collected on an annual basis since 1985 as part of Ordnance Survey's map updating process, this study will examine the way in which growth in employment generating activities and housing demand was accommodated in small and medium sized settlements in England.
It will also explore the extent to which such changes are related to population and employment change and improvements to transport infrastructure.
Special attention will also be focused on the extent to which development took place on land previously in rural uses as opposed to re-cycled urban land and the role of national and local planning policy in steering development to particular locations.

This research provides the opportunity to explore the way in which the employment opportunities deriving from the tourist/visitor potential of areas peripheral to a core area of residential tourist development can be modelled.
For such areas the routeways traversed to reach them are an integral part of the attraction of the resource and need to be included in assessment.
Most research in this field has concentrated upon areas of recreation potential or development outside urban areas, or in activity spaces such as parks.
This study focuses instead upon interests in essentially urban industrial landscapes, raising questions of the methodology of assessment in these particular circumstances.
One of the techniques to be tried out in the study is the value of using grid square mapping of the attractions in the urban areas, a technique hitherto applied to extensive resource assessment.
The practical value of the study lies in its aim to contribute to the development of a tourist/visitor industry using local resources in an area of economic and social need and to the provision of information useful for the assessment of the alternative ways in which the tourist industry might be developed and jobs generated.

The Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys Longitudinal Study has for a 1% sample of the population of England and Wales in 1971, brought together census information, with information about geographic movements noted in the National Health Service Central Register in 1971-74.
This project considers the characteristics of individuals in the same households in a study of migration between 1966 and 1970 and between 1970 and 1971.
It characterises movers and movements to look at the propensity and timing of moves in relation to some of the social and demographic factors underlying geographic movement.
These factors include leaving parental home, marriage, fertility history, occupational change, retirement and sickness in old age.
Then by looking prospectively from census to movement in the period 1971-74, the project tests whether the characteristics and circumstances associated with movement in 1966-71 were also associated with movement after the census.
While the main aim of the project is to study socio-demographic factors in migration, the project is used to explore and advertise the potential contribution of this new data source to national demographic analysis.

Scotland's population was very mobile in the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with high levels of migration abroad and, within Scotland, from rural areas to the towns.
The readiness of Scots to migrate at this period has prompted suggestions that there were forces inherent in Scottish society which encouraged high levels of mobility and a propensity to migrate, but this has yet to be shown.
This research aims to study the amount, patterns, and causes of the geographical mobility of population within Scotland during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and to compare the findings with work which has been done on other European countries, particularly England.
The investigation uses a variety of manuscript sources in Scottish archives to examine population movements within the countryside, and between rural areas and the towns.
The project follows on from research carried out by the investigators into the structure of Scottish rural society during early-modern times.

Few studies of the nineteenth-century migration process have concentrated on the detailed longitudinal analysis of specific groups of migrants.
The research focuses on one large and diverse group — those Welsh who migrated from Wales to English towns in the mid-nineteenth century — and through the analysis of group experiences examines both the process of migration and the impact which it had on cultural and social change.
Particular attention is paid to the methodological problems of identifying and linking long distance migrants over time in origin and destination areas and the project appraises the use of computer linkage techniques in historical research.
The main sources to be used include census enumerators' books and a wide range of archival data relating to the characteristics of Welsh communities in Wales and England.
A sample of English towns will be chosen and Welsh migrants traced from these towns back to their communities of origin.
The construction of detailed migration histories from census and archival evidence will enable the project to examine themes such as migration paths, the impact of migration on communities in Wales, and the effect of migration to England on the survival of Welsh culture.

The settlement of first generation Asian immigrants in this country has been characterized by social and spatial segregation from the indigenous population, which has been found to reflect a combination of social, economic and cultural factors.
Less, however, is known about the second generation of Asians and the extent to which this group is challenging the internal and external forces for segregation.
This research examines the importance of both cultural and racial characteristics in the emerging pattern of second generation settlement, and the implications of the findings for the social advancement of the group.
In particular, the research will examine
(1)
internal pressures from within the minority community for maintaining cultural integrity;
(2)
continuing discrimination against Asians through formal (institutional) and informal channels;
(3)
the role of racial harassment in maintaining social and spatial segregation between the minority and indigenous groups;
(4)
the response of the second generation to discrimination and social exclusion in general, and in the housing market in particular .
Special reference will be made to the Asian population living in Leicester.
The investigation draws on data collected primarily through a questionnaire survey of second generation Asian households.
It builds on work undertaken by the researcher on the first generation in Leicester, thus providing a basis for intergenerational comparison.

The grant created work time to allow the completion of the research on housing provision in Sweden.
Most data collection and analysis was already available from previous research, and the aim here was to increase empirical and conceptual depth so as to allow critical engagement with current policy debate over housing provision in Britain.
Sweden is a valuable comparative exemplar because of 
(i)
its relative success in terms of costs, access and quality, and
(ii)
its relative success in providing housing land and efficiently building housing due, in part, to strong state intervention.

Analysis of marriage patterns in western urban societies has shown consistent patterns of large numbers of marriages taking place between partners who live close to each other with steep decreases in numbers as distance between the residences of partners increase.
Not only do numbers diminish with distance, but it can be shown that there is a statistical over-selection of spouses who live close and corresponding under-selection of those who live far away.
In other words, the selection of spouses living close is not only large, but much larger than chances alone would suggest.
This is not an unsurprising phenomenon since common sense would seem to indicate that people interact more with those that are close than with those who are distant.
Extending this area, it would seem likely that if an ethnic group is highly segregated, much of its interaction will be contained within the group.
It is, indeed, the case that groups that are highly segregated show high degrees of in-marriage.
The present research takes the argument a stage further and investigates whether it is possible to predict the rate at which marriage between sets of ethnic groups will take place from a knowledge of the degree to which the groups are residentially intermixed.
It takes San Francisco marriage certificates for 1980 as its main data base.
California has become the main entrance for the new immigration which is entering the USA in very substantial numbers.
There are not only the Mexicans, Salvadoreans, Nicaraguans, Guatemalans, Costa Ricans and the other medley of middle American ethnic groups, but Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Campucheans, Vietnamese, and the other ethnic groups from South East Asia particularly the Filipinos.
From the patterns of ethnic segregation it appears that a new American ethnic melting pot — or set of melting pots may be forming.

The English landscape is of a richly diverse nature and an understanding of the complex early factors which influenced the creation of its individual regions can only be of value in helping to ensure the preservation of its essential character.
The basis of today's diversity was clearly apparent in the Anglo-Saxon period and a knowledge of the landscape of Anglo-Saxon England is indispensable to studies of the historical geography of all subsequent periods.
This is the earliest period for which good documentation exists which can be interpreted together with archaeological and linguistic evidence to reconstruct the landscape in detail.
This survey follows a pilot study of the West Midlands in the Anglo-Saxon period in which particular use was made of Old English charter material.
Here landscape regions were identified which permitted an investigation to be made of the social and economic effects of land) use patterns, and which allowed the territorial organisation of the period to be set within its geographical framework.
The present study extends research to selected parts of the Anglo) Saxon kingdom of Wessex, covering areas with different environmental conditions and different political backgrounds.

The aim of the research is to examine the impact of recent economic and social change on two of Liverpool's outer housing estates, Kirkby and Speke/Halewood.
These working-class communities, largely the product of post-war slum clearance policy, provided the workforce for some of the leading manufacturing sectors in the economic growth of the 1950s and 1960s.
The economic restructuring of recent years has had a traumatic effect on the estates, with massive job loss and factory closure transforming them into increasingly isolated, state-managed ‘subsistence communities’.
The research seeks to explain why and how this dramatic reversal in economic fortunes has occurred, tracing its effects on the social, political and cultural life of the estates.
These being largely the creation of, and increasingly dependent upon central and national government policy, the research will also explore the effectiveness of a whole range of national, regional and local planning policies.
The methodology to be adopted reflects the overall theoretical framework, in recognising the need to integrate investigation of economic, social, cultural and political change.
Both quantitative and qualitative analyses of restructuring involving company and trade union interviews, will be undertaken, together with in-depth, life-history case studies of individuals living on the estates.

Middlesbrough developed in the middle of the nineteenth century as a coal port and then as a major centre of steel and chemical production.
These two industries dominated the town's employment as well as its social life and this situation lasted for a century.
Recently, however, things changed.
Rationalisation of production has seen employment at both BSC and ICI decline rapidly.
In this context new kinds of employment (eg public and private services) have come to the fore and with it a rise in the proportion of female workers.
Equally significant has been the rise in unemployment which is now higher here than in any other county in mainland Britain.
By way of documentary investigation and detailed interviews, the research project examines these changes.
and the effects they are having upon the lives of the people in the town and their future prospects.

In previous work funded by the Social Science Research Council in 1980-81, the main post-war processes involved in the reorganisation of the Lancaster economy were detailed.
Particular attention was paid to the floor coverings, textile and chemicals industries.
In this further research a variety of service industries, in education, health care and in the provision of services to private companies, will be investigated.
Attention will be devoted to how people are recruited into such work, with their patterns of geographical and social mobility, and with their social attitudes and political practices.
In the examination of the ‘restructuring’ of the Lancaster economy, a particular focus will be the place that women play in different service sectors and in their social and political practices.
The effect of women's work on the distribution of domestic tasks within households will be a further important focus on research.
Some attention will be directed as to whether households are becoming increasingly ‘privatized’.

Most farmers are either owner-occupiers or tenants: however, a growing number are managers.
This project seeks to examine this group of farmers, find out how they are affecting agriculture and what kinds of careers they follow.
In theory, a farm manager should be like the manager of a factory; that is, a salaried employee in charge of , and responsible for, the operation and development of the farm as a business.
There are nearly 8,000 farm managers in British agriculture and it has been suggested that this young, better trained group are at the forefront of the improvement of agriculture.
There has been little previous research into the origins of this group, nor into whether farm management is a career in its own right or just a stepping stone to becoming a tenant or owner-occupier.
The research will study the training of farm managers at college and their recruitment by farm management companies and individual landowners.
Also, an extensive survey of farm managers will be conducted to find out about their careers, migration, responsibilities and farming practices.
Their employers will also be interviewed, and other farms will be surveyed so as to provide a point of comparison.

This programme capitalises on recent discoveries about the nature of urban change.
It has been shown that ‘critical points’ are reached (for instance when car ownership achieves a certain level) at which key elements of urban structure are transformed.
An example was the switch from corner-shop retailing to supermarkets in the 1960s; a current example of this kind of rapid structural change (which can occur in relation to housing, transport, the organisation of industry and the structures of service provision — both public and private) is obviously crucial to the development of more effective planning policies.
The main objectives of the programme are concerned with the working out and testing of the new theories for actual cities — both for individual sectors and for a comprehensive urban ‘model’, this latter being important because structural change in one sector can trigger such change in another.
Particular attention is being paid to the task of connecting the models to be developed to the most important planning problems; and so this will include, for example, the relationship between unemployment and the reshaping of the labour market through changing industrial and service structures.

The major forces of change to the farmed landscape arise primarily out of the post-war agricultural policies which have encouraged the specialisation and industrialisation of farming practice and a more intensive use of farm land.
The possibilities for current and prospective changes in such policies are creating uncertainties over the future of the rural environment.
The study examines the social and economic processes promoting such changes in farm practice and farm business structure by
(i)
furthering understanding of the evolution of the family farm
(ii)
investigating the role of landlord-tenant relations in landscape change
(iii)
conducting farm based surveys in three contrasting agricultural contexts: the Metropolitan Green Belt, North Bedfordshire and the Somerset/Dorset border, and
(iv)
examining how the farm owner and occupier respond to advice on land development proposals, and to those policy measures designed to conserve the landscape.
Evidence will be collected which will allow the relationship between landscape and the control of land to be monitored over time, providing the statutory bodies concerned with conservation of the landscape with a better means of influencing change.
The research work will contribute to debates on landscape conservation policy during a period when agricultural priorities and existing policies are being progressively questioned from a variety of quarters.

The 1980s have seen dramatic changes in patterns of employment and labour relations, and sustained mass unemployment.
New styles of management and industrial relations have emerged, alongside a polarisation between groups in different kinds of employment, between those in and out of work, and between different areas.
The team at SAUS is collaborating with a team at the University of Bath in a study of Swindon, an expanding town on the M4 which is thought to have received more than its share of the benefits of economic change.
The SAUS team is taking responsibility for a survey of local employers.
The methodology involves a combination of face-to-face interviews with selected employers, and an administered large-scale questionnaire.
These together will generate far more comprehensive data than are currently available on the pattern of employment, the underlying influences, and the employment prospects of different social groups.
This work complements the Changing Urban and Regional System initiative, described elsewhere here.

This project studies the Northampton labour market as a part of a country wide initiative designed to investigate how labour markets operate under different economic and social conditions.
The intention is to study, on the one hand, the implication of rapid economic and industrial change for individuals, households and communities, and, on the other hand, the implications of social and economic change for the recruitment, training and employment policies of employers.
Involvement in the Initiative requires the Cambridge group to participate in the planning and execution of centrally organised surveys of work attitudes and work histories of individuals, and of households and employers.
In addition, two related studies are being undertaken.
The first of these is an intensive examination of the employees of a sample of firms to be included in the core survey.
The intention is to link directly the employment policies and practices of firms to the attitudes, skills and job orientation of their employees.
The study will extend to an investigation of the work histories of the workers and their labour market aspirations to allow for their experience with their current employer to be fitted into their broader labour market experience.
The second related study is designed to investigate the relationship between welfare provision, household organisation and labour market activity including the role played by occupation linked pension and other welfare schemes, state financed social security and that provided within the family and the community.
The intention is to link the labour market analysis to household and community organisation in a consideration of how non-wage employment benefits affect the household and how state and other social welfare provision influence the labour market activity of household members.

The South East Regional Research Laboratory (SERRL) is run jointly by the Departments of Geography at Birkbeck College and the LSE.
In line with other RRLs in the country, it is expected that SERRL will carry out five major tasks when it is fully operational.
These are: data library services, data base management, software development, methodological research, and research training.
More immediately the SERRL team will build upon their planning applications and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) experience during the 18 month trial period.
The main aim isto explore the feasibility of setting up an integrated physical and community infrastructure data base.
Such a data base will be relevant for business planning and policy impact analysis.
The work programme will include the integration of typical area-based data with networkfiles and service provision locations; a review of infrastructure investment projects and development issues in the South East; and establishing contact with potential client-user groups in the region.

The project was initiated under the auspices of the International Federation of Data Organisations (IFDO) to prepare a comparative European spatial database resource for research and teaching relevant to a wide range of social science disciplines.
This initiative is being undertaken by a consortium of European data archives and academic advisors.
The British team participating is from the ESRC Data Archive at the University of Essex and the Department of Geography at the London School of Economics.
The file will contain cultural, economic, political and social data from various national sources for the period between the 1960s and 1985 for 18 countries at a level of aggregation equivalent to Eurostat Level 3, for example, the Departement in France, the county and Metropolitan Borough in Britain, the Fylke in Norway, the Provincia in Italy, and so on .
Each national file will be fully documented in the national and English language and will include, at the least, an SPSS Dictionary file.
A digital file has been prepared at the LSE in collaboration with the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) to provide linkage with the most commonly available mapping packages and geographical information systems.
In addition to national research council funding for individual country participation, the EUROCOMP comparative project has received support from the Council of Europe, the European Science Foundation and the Volkswagen Foundation.

This grant will provide for research assistance in the coding and analysis of a large data set for Greater Glasgow which records every household move made in the private sector housing stock in a sample year (1983).
The source of the data is the Register of Sasines.
When analysed, the data will provide the basis for studying:
a) the migration sub-areas within Greater Glasgow;
b) the influence of regional planning policy on the location of new housing areas and thus on new migration destinations.
An analysis already exists of the migration patterns of 1974 and it is intended to make direct comparisons between this and the 1983 results.
The interpretation of what the comparison shows will be made in the light of the changes in the administration of planning which took place in 1975 with the reform of Local Government.
A number of policy changes flowed from that event.
The analysis of the data set will be used, additionally, to demonstrate the need for (and the technical possibility of) a migration monitoring system for this city region.

Food is the most important item in the expenditure of most households in the Third World and can account for more than three-quarters of the budget of a poor urban family.
Often such expenditure is raised unnecessarily high by a complex food distribution system in which foreign, rather than local, commodities and personnel take precedence.
In an effort to counteract high prices, many low-income families try to grow as much of their own food as they can, legally or illegally, within the limited spaces of the city.
This project forms the preliminary stage of an investigation of the food distribution system in Harare, Zimbabwe.
It will investigate the ways in which food is obtained by households within different socio-economic groups.
In this way the major sources of food supply and some of their principal characteristics can be identified for further investigation.
The information will be obtained through questionnaire surveys of a sample of households in selected districts of the city.
The research project has emerged from a British Council Exchange Link between the Departments of Geography at the Universities of Keele and Zimbabwe.

The research involves an investigation of the historical geography of a group of communities in the Cambridgeshire fenland for the period 1600-1914.
Extensive use is made of archival materials in the Cambridgeshire Record Office, field work, and census and map data.
The purpose of the research is to test a series of theories recently developed in the field of historical geography against the perceived experience of communities in a hazardous physical and social environment (fenland).
The theories include the concepts of a ‘total’ historical geography and structuration theory.
Linkages will be made to a wider context--notably the parallel experiences of marshland communities in the Low Countries and North-West Germany.
Particular attention will be paid to changes in resource use-rights via enclosure, land drainage, and agricultural improvement schemes, and the interaction with the agricultural labour force.

The research attempts to bring an understanding of the contemporary British training infrastructure to an examination of the reconstruction of skill in the context of a changing labour market.
The thrust of current government training policy is very much one in which the training system is seen as a ‘lever for change’ in the wider economic system.
Whether the particular objective is to provide school leavers with better general training for the labour market or to stimulate the development of more portable skills, it is hoped that government training initiatives, such as the Youth Training Scheme, will provide a catalyst for change.
This key policy issue is addressed by reference to recent events in the engineering sector in three contrasting local labour markets within the North West of England.
The methodology is a two-stage one.
First, the training infrastructure of the three areas is examined.
This involves contact with not only training providers themselves, but also with a number of other key actors such as the Engineering Industry Training Board, Careers Service, Colleges of Further Education and Manpower Services Commission Area Offices.
Secondly, the understanding developed from this ‘supply-side’ perspective is reflected onto the ‘demand-side’by interviewing local engineering employers about their knowledge and usage of local training provision.
The first phase of the study, reported in Peck and Haughton (1987)*, has focused upon the changing nature of the infrastructure, drawing out implications both for policy and for labour market segmentation theory.
Although YTS has proved to be an important catalyst for change, the nature of these changes has in many ways been unexpected.
Rather than bringing about increased skills portability, YTS has proved instrumental in bringing about a sharpening of labour market segmentation, as the conditions surrounding entry to jobs at all levels has become more formalized and rigidified.
Such outcomes are, perhaps, surprising for a policy aimed at promoting flexibility and mobility in the labour market.

The principal feature of population redistribution revealed by the 1980/81 round of Censuses in advanced Western countries was a massive shift from the larger cities to smaller settlements and remoter rural areas over the previous ten years.
Reference to annual series of population estimates indicates that in Great Britain, this process began to accelerate in the mid 1960s and has waned since reaching a peak in the early 1970s.
The research aims to identify the influence which demographic and housing factors have had on these developments in Britain and their phasing over time.
Preliminary observations suggest that the acceleration of the exodus from the larger cities coincided with a period of intensive family raising and with large-scale clearance of sub-standard housing, while in contrast, the last ten years have witnessed falling fertility, population ageing, higher divorce rates and other changes leading to different housing requirements, as well as government efforts to redevelop inner city areas and curb the rate of decentralization.
The research seeks to quantify these changes at the local scale and assess their significance for population redistribution rates in order to gauge better the geographical implications of anticipated trends in population structure.

The Greater London Transportation Survey (GLTS) of 1981, carried out by the Greater London Council (GLC), included a home-interview survey providing details of a weekday's travel by a representative sample of over 90,000 residents in nearly 40,000 households, together with relevant information about the households.
The size and quality of this sample, its relatively recent date, and the fact that it includes travel on foot and by pedal cycle in the same detail as motorised travel make the resulting data particularly valuable for the study of many aspects of personal travel on weekdays in London.
In particular it lends itself to analysis by a technique which has received limited application to extensive data for a British conurbation, namely the technique of trip chains.
A trip chain is a sequence of trips beginning when a resident leaves home, and ending when they next return home.
It follows from this definition that the analysis of a pattern of travel in terms of trip chains can embody necessary interactions between successive journeys a person makes.
The embodiment of such interactions, though not necessary to the understanding of the morning peak hour movements to work or education which have often been the primary focus of transport planning, is important to the understanding of other less straight-forward parts of the daily pattern of travel, which are important both to the travellers themselves and also to those concerned with the planning and provision of transport.
The research aims to explore the possibilities of trip chain analysis sufficiently to establish in what ways the technique may be of value to practising transport planners.
The objectives of the proposed work are:
(a)
to use trip chain analysis to identify categories of travel that are amenable to analysis and modelling separately from the main peak-hour movements.
(b)
to examine to what extent the generation of such travel and the mode used for it are associated with particular household, personal or locational characteristics, and
(c)
to examine to what extent such travel is localised or may require modelling over the conurbations as a whole.

A central issue in the 1984-5 miners' strike was the preservation of jobs and communities on the coalfields.
As the National Coal Board has continued to cut coal-mining employment there after the end of the strike, it has placed great emphasis upon the role of its job-creating subsidiary, NCB (Enterprises) in providing alternative jobs.
The research project will investigate in detail the employment creating effects of NCB (E) 's operations and how these relate to those of Local Authorities, Central Government Departments and other job-creating organiastions in the areas in which it operates.
Its main focus will be north east England and south Wales, the two regions in which NCB (E) 's job creating activities have, so far, been most successful.
It will seek to identify:
(i)
the location of firms supported by NCB (E) and the numbers and types of jobs they have created.
(ii)
which people have obtained these jobs--how many are ex-miners, for example?
(iii)
the types of companies helped by NCB (E) --are they branches of big multinationals or new small local firms?
(iv)
the types of products that these companies make and the markets in which they sell them;
(v)
the sources of financial and other aid that led these companies to locate on the coalfields.
This information will be obtained in various ways.
First, from the monthly publication British Coal.
Secondly, from discussions with NCB (E) 's regional representatives, Thirdly, from a postal survey of firms receiving aid from NCB (E) and from ‘in-depth’ interviews with a sample of these.
Finally, the actual and likely future effects of NCB (E) 's job creating activities will be compared with those of other agencies on which it was modelled, principally British Steel Corporation (Industry).

Average family size is substantially larger in Northern Ireland than in other parts of the United Kingdom.
Associated with this is a higher than average birth rate, a comparatively high level of natural increase, relatively heavy out-migration and a young population age structure.
Northern Ireland is also arguably the most socially and economically deprived region of the United Kingdom.
The prime objectives of the research are to establish the determinants of higher fertility in the Province, the magnitude of the main fertility differentials, and likely trends in fertility in the short term future.
The necessary data will be collected by questionnaire survey.
It is intended to interview a representative sample of 3,000 married women under the age of 60 together with a sample of 500 of their husbands.
A draft questionnaire has already been piloted.

A completed project investigated the views of decision-makers in ports about how they viewed port development in Europe; and the same subject was discussed by shipowners — the ‘seaward customers’ of ports.
This follow-up project aims to seek the views of the ‘landward customers’ of ports on port developments in Europe, especially where there is competition between shipping routes.
The people to be interviewed are known as freight forwarding agents, who act for individual exporters and importers.
About 100 interviews in Britain and mainland Europe will be directed towards eliciting the factors in the choice of cargo routes via seaports and the choice between the sea/air alternative.
Particular attention will be paid to forwarding agents in inland areas where route choices via seaports could be expected to be at a maximum: ie the Midlands in England, eastern France, south-western Federal Republic of Germany, and Switzerland.
The interview technique has been designed to stimulate discussion of the topic in question with as little prompting as possible, again justifying the phrase which was used in the title of the report of the previous project: ‘Transport decision-makers speak’.

In 1938-39 Professor Richard Hartshorne of the University of Minnesota spent a year in Europe.
His original intention was to do research in Political Geography, but Central Europe was at that time too political for such research to be practical.
Instead, Professor Hartshorne settled in Vienna to research the history of modern Geography, mainly but not exclusively in the German-speaking lands.
The result was the extremely influential The Nature of Geography, 1939.
The aim of this investigation is to take the story of the development of German Geography onwards from the point at which Hartshorne finished, essentially with the methodological work of A Hettner (1859-1941).
This will involve not only consideration of the period of National-Socialist rule (1933-45) but the academic impact of the division into two Germanies, East and West.

The research involved the assembly and appraisal of quantitative and qualitative information on employment and unemployment in the Norwich Diocese of the Church of England.
It was essentially a fact-finding and largely descriptive exercise designed to produce a 20,000 word report which would be widely distributed in Norfolk and stimulate a debate in the Church as to its responsibilities in this domain.
The work was done with two part-time researchers at the University of East Anglia working under Church and University supervision.
What the report comprises is a wide ranging resum'e of Norfolk's (un) employment situation in the mid 1980s, with attention paid to the sectoral, occupational, temporal, spatial and socio-economic dimensions.
The unemployment rate in the area is about 13 per cent, being rather higher in the winter months and near the coast.
Unemployment grew rapidly to 1982 and has tended to level off since then.
Considered in some detail is the importance and plight of certain groups of unemployed, notably the long-term and those under 25.
The supply of jobs is considered as is the notion of a two-tier labour market including core and transient jobs.

How to involve local communities in the planning and development of their neighbourhoods is a problem faced by both community groups and housing and planning authorities in Northern Ireland.
Difficulties associated with the absence of local democratic control over major services in the province, multiple deprivation and civil conflict have led to an increasing focus on the particular needs of Northern Ireland in this area of social policy.
A recent initiative to tackle these problems is the establishment of a voluntary organisation called Community Technical Aid (Northern Ireland).
This organisation provides technical assistance to community groups on planning, housing and environmental matters.
The research aims to evaluate the extent to which the organisation is meeting the needs of community groups, statutory agencies and local councils with regard to popular participation in the planning and development of local neighbourhoods.
The investigation tests whether the benefits desired by different groups are being achieved through the Community Technical Aid project.
In addition, the research examines the role of the Community Technical Aid organisation in the present political and administrative situation in Northern Ireland.
The method of investigation involves case studies of projects undertaken by Community Technical Aid (Northern Ireland), surveys of community groups, statutory agencies, local councils and funding agencies, and a study of the development and implementation of the Community Technical Aid organisation.

This project is concerned with how location influences the competitiveness, efficiency and growth of small firms manufacturing like products in different regions.
Five regions have been chosen to assess the problems associated with small firms growth in peripheral environments — namely South East/East Anglia, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and South Wales.
Each has its own distinct policies to aid small firms which, inter alia, will be reflected in their performance.
The major research instrument used will be a detailed interview survey of approximately fifty matched pairs of small firms making similar products, drawn from five peripheral regions and matched with the non-assisted area — East Anglia.
The main thrust of the project is to compare both demand and supply factors as they affect small firms (defined as employing between 5 and 100 persons) in the different regions.
A holistic approach is proposed in order that regional disadvantages (eg transport costs) may be weighted against advantages (eg lower wages or rents).
Analyses of demand factors will seek to show the extent to which small firms are dependent upon the local economy, and what difficulties they may experience in selling beyond their immediate locality.
The analysis will show how dependent small businesses are on their major customers; how much is sold outside the local area economy; and how competitive factors influence their sales.
The competitive strengths and weaknesses of the individual small firm will be examined in order to determine on what basis (eg price, quality, applications engineering etc) the small firm competes for orders and whether it is able to meet the competitive requirements.
On the supply side it is proposed to analyse four major character-istics of the firm: the quality of the main types of factors of production used with a particular emphasis upon managerial staff and skilled personnel; the costs of production of specific products and the techniques of manufacturing; managerial strategies and functions; and the financial strategy of the firm.
Second, a comparison will be made of the method and costs of producing a particular product in the different regions — including labour costs, material costs, energy costs and so on.
Such costs would be expected to differ regionally because of local supply and demand conditions and the influence of transport costs.
Overall these differences will have an impact of competitiveness and expansion.
It is a central proposition of this research that there will be different regional effects upon small firm performance in the regions selected.
By focusing upon the costs of production in different regions, the bases of competition, various indices of performance, and the major bottlenecks to growth, the study should contribute to an improved understanding of spatial variations in small firm development.
Furthermore, a clearer view of the causes of spatial variation in small firm performance will help to establish the type of spatially selective small firms policies needed and the design of policy instruments.

A combination of European Community (EC) budgetary problems, scientific doubt and public concern has created a climate of considerable uncertainty for the future of the cereal sector of Britain's agricultural industry.
During the next 18 months the cereals regime of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is due to be reassessed by the Council of Ministers and there is a widespread conviction within the agricultural industry, and among its observers, that the present system will be replaced by one designed to reduce cereal output.
Producers are thus viewing the scheduled negotiations over the cereal's regime of the CAP with some apprehension.
This project proposes therefore to carry out a short investigation of UK cereal producers, their representative organisations, the UK and European agricultural bureaucracies, concerned politicians and pressure groups.
The project's aim is to map the current position by concentrating on the perceptions of the major actors in the cereals policy community.
It is hoped to determine their preferences for various alternative supply instruments and incentives such as prices, quotas, nitrogen taxes and land withdrawals.
For example, given the heterogeneous nature of cereal production in the UK, a uniform response is not expected but rather a range of opinion amongst producers, largely dependent on the degree to which producers are committed to intensive cereal production.
Moreover it is hoped to examine the process by which these preferences will be formulated into policy at the different levels of institutional and State organisations under study.

Forestry is an important form of land use and source of employment in many parts of rural Scotland.
Substantial areas, especially in upland Scotland, are being afforested each year.
A large and increasing proportion of afforestation is being undertaken by the private sector, which includes both large landed estates with long traditions of involvement in forestry and also forestry investment groups which have become active in recent years.
The proposed research has four main objectives.
The first of these is to establish the geographical pattern, at the national and local scales, and the land types of areas afforested during the last decade.
The second is to measure the land-use effects of afforestation, in terms of the land use displaced and also in terms of possible neighbourhood effects beyond the areas immediately affected.
Thirdly, the project seeks to measure social impacts in terms of employment provided and employment displaced.
The fourth and final objective is to identify possible variations and contrasts in these aspects of afforestation within the various branches of the private sector.

There is considerable interest in local initiatives aimed at economic regeneration.
These initiatives make it necessary to understand the factors which cause local economies to behave differently from each other, and particularly to know which of these factors are susceptible to action by local business and local government and which are not.
The research develops a method for analysing this question, and applies it to look at change in manufacturing industry in London in the period 1976-81.
Data collected through interviews with management and unions in a dozen industries are analysed to find out what was distinctive about the inherited characteristics of these industries in London at the beginning of the period as compared to other parts of the country.
With this starting point, and in the context of national and international change within these industries, the strategies adopted by management are analysed.
It is then possible to see how much room there was for choice of strategies in terms of competitiveness and jobs.
This method enables a fresh look to be taken at some of the explanations commonly put forward for the decline of manufacturing in the large conurbations, such as skills shortages, problems with labour relations and premises, and difficulties faced by small firms.

Various pieces of legislation since 1968 have placed duties upon Metropolitan Counties to ‘…secure and promote the provision of a properly integrated and efficient system of public passenger transport…’
Shire Counties have similar duties.
The extent to which these have been achieved varies from authority to authority but, in some, considerable progress has been made towards integration.
In contrast, the 1980 Transport Act opened the door to competition by easing the procedures needed to obtain a road service licence.
Most recently the White Paper ‘Buses’(Cmmd 9300, 1984) has proposed the complete abolition of road service licences thereby allowing open competition on stage carriage services.
The contrast between these two policies is stark.
The current Metropolitan authorities feel that many of the benefits which have been achieved from their policies of transport integration will be lost.
This research project examines the contrast between policies of integration and competition in the passenger transport industry.
It is based upon a general review of progress towards integration in the UK and detailed case studies of integrated and competitive services.

The character of the British countryside has evolved due to changing agricultural, industrial and recreational pressures.
Despite the changing character of our landscape, developments often appear to threaten what are regarded as its traditional features.
Consequently, the need for monitoring and evaluating the landscape has become a matter of public concern.
The landscape manager faces major practical difficulties due to lack of basic information, including the extent and location of the individual elements of land cover (woodlands, moorlands, farmland, etc) or the way in which these elements make up the landscape.
Recent advances in remote sensing and computer based processing of digital imagery may overcome such problems.
The research aims to develop techniques of obtaining information about the landscape using remote sensing systems and to present and display these data so that they may be used more effectively for the management of landscape resources.
The study will focus on a number of areas in Wales which have been selected to cover the range of landscape types in the Principality.
The results obtained from the computer analysis will be checked by field investigation.
The techniques developed will lead to a more versatile approach to landscape assessment than is presently possible.

Questions of pollution control and industrial responsiveness to environmental threat have become particularly pressing in recent years.
In this context ‘clean technology’ has emerged as a possible means of reconciling industrial progress and environmental protection in order to achieve a sustainable form of development.
Interest in clean technology among governments, industrial organisations and environmental groups is, therefore, high.
This project has examined the current level of industrial and governmental activity on the area of clean technology.
The study involved the analysis of environmental responses in two industrial areas — the domestic fabric detergent sector and plastics waste in the automobile sector — and also an investigation of companies which have been successfully innovated clean technologies.
The research re-defines the concept of clean technology in such a way as to distinguish between end-of-pipe recycling technologies and those which offer a more integrated approach to pollution abatement.
A number of obstacles to clean technology innovation are identified — with special emphasis on organisational factors which encourage a defensive reaction to environmental concern.
The need for a proactive government policy is emphasised.
The report concludes that clean technologies are still under-developed — but that important lessons can be drawn from current governmental and industrial experience.

In assessing the benefits of road improvements, the Department of Transport takes account of the direct cost savings which accrue to operators of commercial vehicles resulting from improvements to individual road links.
It does not take into account the longer term benefits which result from changes to the size and number of plants and distribution depots, or the quality of delivery service offered to customers, resulting from changes to the network.
The project aims to value these secondary benefits using a small sample of case studies from various sectors of the freight distribution industry.
Each case study will be modelled using a computerised vehicle routing and scheduling package (PARAGON), together with a depot location package (PADLOC).
By altering average road speeds in the model, to reflect the effect of road network improvements, changes in the transport and total distribution costs can be observed.
It is anticipated that the results produced will give a better understanding of firms decision making processes regarding depot location in addition to valuation of road network improvements.

Electronics has been the fastest growing sector of the Scottish economy in recent years, but it is dominated by externally-controlled multi-nationals.
The so-called ‘branch plant syndrome’ has focused attention on the performance of the indigenous sector, which appears to have been far less successful.
Many locally-owned firms have recently experienced financial difficulties, takeovers and other production problems.
The main purpose of the study is to analyse the barriers to growth faced by indigenous enterprises and to assess the scope for further expansion.
The presence locally of major electronics assembly plants using modern methods of management and ‘just-in-time’ techniques may, for instance, present important market opportunities for local companies.
The study will examine the factors and forces which promote and constrain local economic growth.
It will assess the internal characteristics of a selected group of enterprises, including the skills and capacities of their owners and managers.
It will also examine firms' external relationships with their markets and customers.
The research is intended to explore the various ways in which economic influence and control is exercised.
The study should help to understand why indigenous growth has been limited and prove useful to agencies such as Scottish Enterprise and the TECs and LECs, which have made the development of local enterprises a high priority.

This project is concerned with preliminary research and contacts on innovation planning and spatial policy.
It is part of the ESRC French exchange scheme.
The establishment of contacts and research will focus on the Cite Scientifique Paris et Technopolis, Ile-de-France Sud.
This is a major sub-regional planning effort just south of Paris.
It includes a population of some 1.3 million, six new towns and major infrastructure provisions.
It is a significant attempt to use spatial policies to co-ordinate existing research development and future innovations and to facilitate them on the ground.
The objectives of this preliminary work are to develop an Anglo-French research network and secure research partners for future large-scale collaborative and comparative research on the use of technopolis planning to facilitate innovation.
This forms part of a wider investigation of planned and unplanned technopoli in Japan, the USA and Europe.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established under UN auspices in 1988.
Its aim was to examine scientific evidence on climate change, assess environmental and socio-economic impacts and formulate realistic response strategies.
The IPCC reported in June 1990.
However, some of its conclusions have been challenged and there is no consensus on global policy is not straightforward.
The object of this project is to analyse the working of the IPCC and the assumptions upon which the consultative process was founded.
The role of the scientific community and the impact of its advice on the formulation of energy and R&D policy in selected countries will be examined.
The study will be based on a wide ranging review of IPCC documentation and associated literature, questionnaire for selected IPCC participants and users, interviews with key actors and observation of scientific meetings.
The work will be carried out in close association with other climate-related projects under way in the Energy and Environment Programmes at the Science Policy Research Unit.

One of the more distinctive features of urban policy in Britain during the 1980s was the return of large scale, comprehensive, redevelopment led by the Urban Development Corporations (UDCs).
It is clear that UDCs will sustain a lead in urban policy up to the mid 1990s, yet knowledge of the operations, delivery, and outcomes of UDC policy and strategy is limited.
This project seeks, in part, to redress this by measuring the evolution and effects of one strand of UDC policy.
The project is based on a two year longitudinal case study of the policies of one particular UDC, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC).
The research will investigate the influence of local actors, politicians, and community groups, on the evolution and implementation of CBDC's policies.
This will provide a detailed picture of the (local) processes which lead to the formation and implementation of urban policy.
Moreover, by using a sample survey of local businesses in CBDC's area, the research will monitor the distributional effects of CBDC's policies.
The information gathered will provide insights in to how one local community group react to urban policy, their means and methods for influencing the nature of the policy frameworks, as well as outlining the uneven distributional effects which ensue from the implementation of urban policy.

Under pressure from a combination of population increase, growing national demands and increased state intervention, local or community systems for the protection and management of forests, surface and groundwater, grazing lands and other natural resources have broken down, resulting in a damaging shift towards open access exploitation of finite ‘common pool’ resources.
Despite this, notions of community management and people's participation are central to contemporary strategies of environmental rehabilitation in various sectors (irrigation, forestry, pasture etc.) in developing countries.
Taking minor ‘tank’ irrigation in Tamil Nadu as a case, the principle aims of the research are twofold: firstly, through historical research to understand the social and cultural systems which have sustained collective water management in the past and identify the socio-economic and demographic factors associated with their decline; and secondly, through the comparative study of on-going programmes to suggest the necessary conditions for successful establishment of systems of community resource management in the present day social context.
Through detailed village studies the research aims to look critically at problems and opportunities of existing approaches to promoting local institutions (water users associations, farmer groups etc.) for common property resource management.

In co-operation with Carmarthenshire District Council Environmental Health Department, this investigation proposes to ascertain the significance of the management of special wastes as a factor in attracting new industry.
Carmarthenshire is a rural area with small industrial estates to which the local authority is keen to attract modern high-technology industrial companies.
These firms will probably be producers of light-weight, high-value goods but the existing small high-technology businesses have found problems of toxic waste disposal.
At present the local authority has no facilities for toxic waste disposal, which must be sent elsewhere.
By investigating current wastes (and the range of wastes from companies which have expressed interest in moving to a clean rural environment) it is intended to evaluate the type and amounts of wastes likely to arise and to establish the most effective means of dealing with them.

Local authority transport planners face the problem of assessing the merits of diverse types of transport improvement projects among which their funds must be allocated.
A wide variety of appraisal techniques has been used including points scoring methods.
Under these, points are allotted to projects for their expected effects on accessibility, environment, economic development, safety etc, and the results are used to help determine priorities.
These methods are not at all standardised, and draw little in their design on the parent body of knowledge, multiple criteria decision making.
They are, however, more suited to the problem than conventional cost-benefit analysis, and are capable of development.
The aims of the research are: to undertake a wide-ranging review of the priority assessment techniques applied by local authorities to transport projects; to apply a representative sample of the techniques to a common set of projects; and to distill the experience gained through the first two stages, together with knowledge of recent developments in the theory and practice of multiple criteria analysis into a computer-based priority assessment package.
The aim is to simplify and streamline existing techniques, and also to explore the use of expert systems as aids to decision making in this area.

Energy conservation policy as pursued in the UK (eg pricing policy, loft insulation grants and various publicity campaigns) has tended to embody a relatively passive philosophy, relying on the consumer to respond appropriately.
The aim of the research is to examine and evaluate a variety of projects that have been established to increase the uptake of energy conservation measures.
The designation of an energy action city and an energy conservation area, the development of technology networks, and the preparation of community energy plans are examples of such initiatives.
Within these initiatives, different objectives, participants, funding arrangements, and approaches have been identified.
The research will involve three main components:
(1)
in-depth case studies
(2)
development of an evaluation framework
(3)
comparative assessment of the case studies.
The three components will enable the assessment of wider social, economic, and environmental objectives, as well as an assessment of the impact of an individual initiative.
The research results will have practical implications for improving the impact of existing energy conservation initiatives, duplicating successful approaches, and pursuing national energy conservation objectives.

Professional producer services, such as accountancy, advertising agencies, merchant banks and legal practices, have become an increasingly important component in the British economy during the last 15 years.
These services are used increasingly by both British and foreign-owned companies to improve their product/service quality and competitiveness.
This project is intended to increase our understanding of the factors which have affected the growth in employment and output of the largest British and foreign-owned professional producer service firms.
The pattern of growth of these firms will be examined and the way in which this is likely to boost the performance of particular urban and regional economies.
Consideration will also be given to the prospects for the future growth of these services.
Information about the activities to be included will be obtained in the first instance from a synthesis of existing published material which will be used to summarise these firms on the basis of a number of standard characteristics.
Secondly, a postal survey, together with a small number of face-to-face interviews, will be undertaken with a view to filling out some of the material obtained from the initial synthesis.

The Research programme on Environmental Issues was set up by the ESRC Environment and Planning Committee with the aim of increasing the intellectual and practical contributions of the social sciences to the understanding and amelioration of environmental problems.
It is supporting four working groups on
(i)
Energy and the Environment,
(ii)
Environmental Economics,
(iii)
Risk and
(iv)
Rural Land Use, which will identify research priorities in their areas, producing publications on theoretical, methodological and policy-related questions.
There are also seven major research projects, four on aspects of rural land use, from private woodlands and the rural landscape in general to control of the perceived over-production of arable crops, two on the evaluation of energy supply and conservation options and one on the management of hazardous, non-nuclear, chemical wastes.
Other components of the programme are a small grant to study urban environmental management: a series of seminars on environmental conservation and development, and a conference on the siting of hazardous technological facilities; a joint ESRC/NERC research fellowship in Common Agricultural Policy impact studies and a joint ESRC/AFRC research project looking at the interaction of technology, attitude and policy in the practice of crop protection.
Dr J Tait of the Faculty of Technology Systems at the Open University was appointed as Co-ordinator for the Programme, with responsibility for the development of the Programme.
The role of the Co-ordinator will be: to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas among the people involved in the Programme; to encourage new contributions to it; to develop a series of linking themes relevant to the components of the Programme, possibly leading to the creation of an integrated framework for the study of environmental issues in general; and to co-ordinate publication of the results and ideas generated by the Programme.

This research project aims to make an empirical assessment of the effects of the development, in Gateshead's Enterprise Zone, of Britain's first true ‘out-of-town’ regional shopping centre on the North American principle, together with other groups of stores outside traditional centres.
It is intended to be of practical use in the formulation of policies of both public and private sectors in the future.
A broader academic aim is to relate the effects identified to other processes of retail change and to compare them with the impact of other major developments.
The project will be linked to other store location research at the Oxford Institute of Retail Management.
The study will measure the impact of the new centres on trading, employment and consumer behaviour, using methods developed by Dr Davies in earlier work.
Large sample surveys of retailers and consumers, land use inventories and pedestrian flow measurements in the region's shopping centres will be undertaken.
It is intended to construct a new spatial classification of retail activity in the conurbation, to consider changes in the structure of retail employment in relation to local labour supply, and to assess the differential impact of change on various groups of consumers.

Industrial change, the recession and cuts in public expenditure have left many urban areas with jobless and disheartened communities, neglected buildings, much vacant land and a sharply declining quality in the local environment.
Many different community-based initiatives are emerging in response to these circumstances, some of them specifically concerned with the local environment.
They involve a variety of practical conservation activities — energy-saving, waste recycling and the greening of derelict land.
Some groups can claim considerable success in neighbourhood improvement (at modest financial cost) by making use of locally wasted assets — land, buildings and people with skill and energy.
This project examines a variety of these initiatives in a small number of English cities looking at how they began, their strengths and weaknesses, capacity for job creation and training, links to other groups and use of financial and technical support services.
Case study material is being gathered principally by interviews with the groups and their staff and with other local agencies.
Special attention is being paid to income-earning environmental enterprises.
The study aims to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these environmental initiatives and how their work might be extended.

In the recent past agricultural policies have generated pressure to extend and intensify production, particularly of arable crops, leading to undesirable changes in the countryside such as removal of trees and hedges, soil erosion, nitrate pollution of groundwater etc.
The EEC countries are now producing more of nearly all agricultural products than can be consumed or profitably exported.
Policies must be found which will prevent the ‘mountains’ of surplus products growing larger.
Can they also reverse the degradation of the rural environment?
One such policy is ‘set-aside’, preferably in the form of ‘conservation agreements’ such as have been made in the USA, whereby farmers are compensated for diverting land from arable cropping into pasture or woodland.
Instead of paying a farmer something like £200 a year to grow unwanted cereals on a hectare of land, a similar sum would be paid to encourage a more desirable land use.
The research project would lead to proposals concerning the amount of land that should be taken out of production, which land should be chosen and by what means ‘set-aside’ can be encouraged.
Possible use of the new EC structures regulation on environmentally sensitive areas will be explored.
A survey of farmers' attitudes, and of possible social effects in rural areas will complete the study.

Over the past fifteen years concern has been growing over the environmental effects and social costs of ‘acid rain'.
When fossil fuels are combusted, sulphur and nitrogen oxides (SO2 and NOx) are emitted into the atmosphere and finally deposited, in the dry or wet state, as acidic substances which are detrimental to living animal and plant life, human health and to structures and buildings.
Techniques for reducing these emissions are available and are being applied in a number of countries.
The main obstacle to the widespread use of abatement techniques is the significant and variable national costs which are incurred.
As deposits in any country may originate both from domestic and foreign emissions, national or limited multinational abatement policies have little chance of success.
This research project is an environmental and economic study designed to identify abatement policies that would reduce deposits in environmentally sensitive areas at minimum total cost to the European Region as a whole.
A model system relates energy consumption to emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions.
Through an atmospheric transport model an acidic deposition pattern for Europe is obtained.
Environmentally sensitive areas are determined and goals for reducing deposits will then be established.
Abatement strategies to meet these goals will be determined on the basis of cost-effectiveness for the European Region as a whole.
Finally, problems and possibilities for implementing these strategies politically will be identified.

The last 15 years have seen the emergence of a new sector of the housing market: the conversion of large, older houses into flats for sale for owner occupation.
Although the number of conversions is not very high nationally, they play an increasingly important role in central and inner London where land and house prices are very high and where there is little scope for new private house building.
Between 1966 and 1981 the number of conversions more than doubled in Greater London and, according to the Nationwide Building Society, conversions accounted for between 30 and 60 percent of all mortgages granted in central and inner London in 1984/85.
This project will investigate the characteristics and residential decision making of households living in the sector and the extent to which conversions comprise a first affordable step on the owner occupied housing ladder for young first time buyers.
It will also examine the structure and economics of the conversion business and the nature of the conversion process itself as well as looking at local authority planning policy on conversions and the problems conversion may generate.
In addition to analysing census and building society data on the households living in conversions, the project will include surveys of households living in conversions and developers in two inner London boroughs.

The level of owner occupation in Britain has increased rapidly during the last 30 years to the point where nearly two out of every three households either own or are buying their own home.
The advent of mass owner occupation has not only meant widespread property ownership for the first time, it has also meant that inheritance of house property has become increasingly common.
The period since 1970 has also been characterised by three major bouts of house price inflation which have increased average house prices by over 600%.
As a result of these two trends, the importance of house ownership in overall wealth holding has grown to almost 50% and a growing number of individuals are inheriting valuable house property.
Little is known however of the precise importance of housing within inheritance as a whole, the social characteristics of the beneficiaries, the uses to which housing inheritance is put, or of its impact on the housing market.
This pilot study is designed to throw some light on these important questions.
It is based on a sample of 1,000 probated wills from Somerset House of London residents who died in 1981 and who had one or more beneficiaries with a London address.
A questionnaire survey of the beneficiaries who can be traced will be carried out in an attempt to answer some of these questions.
If the methodology proves successful, the research may subsequently be extended nationwide.

The role of the planning system in managing land use change has come under increasing critical examination.
The system still retains many of the elements put in place in 1947.
Yet the nature of development processes, the way we value our environment and the role of local authorities and local politics has changed significantly in the past forty years.
In recent years, research at Oxford has focused on how the planning system has been put to work in the past decade.
With this work as a background, it is now possible to review and develop the various options for change in the planning system which are currently proposed.
These will be assessed in terms of policies, the tools needed to pursue them, institutional responsibilities, and working methods needed to realise new directions.
The study will draw on experience in Europe, the US and Australia, as well as visits to discuss planning issues and problems in different parts of the country, and discussion seminars.

Expert systems--computer programmes which perform the role of professional experts--have had a mixed reception since they moved from the research lab into industry and commerce.
For some they herald the dawn of a new age in computing; others see them as nothing more than conventional programmes limited to solving trivial problems.
In recent years, expert system shells have been produced to make the job of building an expert system quicker, easier and less costly.
They consist of a complete system but without specific knowledge from the area of expertise, which must be provided by the user.
The research project aims to explore the suitability of expert systems for development control and to indicate what type of system suits the information needs of development control officers.
Development control is seen as an advice giving activity with the officer having an intermediary role between the demands of developers and the local planning authority.
The main method of investigation will be a series of interviews with senior development control officers from one local authority planning department, in order to develop a prototype system using an expert system shell, followed by a wider interview survey involving several local authorities to corroborate the initial findings and further refine the system.

Housing
Housebuilding is a labour intensive activity and occupies a relatively large proportion of the total labour force of the building industry.
It also places demands on the suppliers of a wide range of building materials and components, resulting in a significant multiplier effect on regional employment and business activity.
The programme of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) is by far the largest component in the local building investment programme.
Measures to improve efficiency and productivity in this single sector can therefore make an important contribution towards the social and economic well-being of Northern Ireland.

During the past 15 years, the market for new passenger cars in the United Kingdom and in other major European countries appears to have been very unstable.
Preliminary research suggests that variations in the sales of cars may still be substantially explained by models based on a stable relationship between the value of depreciated stock and economic variables such as disposable incomes and relative prices.
Such models were applied to the car market by several authors in the 1960s and early 1970s; this research is intended to determine whether the principle can still be usefully applied in forecasting the size of the market.
This project examines how far the model can be used to explain and possibly forecast car sales in the UK, France, Germany and Belgium.
The research includes consultations with some of those engaged in forecasting in each of these countries.

The Committee Research Programme on the Changing Urban and Regional System is concerned with the way in which localities in the UK are being radically and differentially affected by processes of restructuring.
Some important insights into the urban economic implications of restructuring have been provided by previous research, in particular the ESRC Inner Cities Research Programme.
However, relatively little is understood about the links between economic and social change at the local level or the links between general processes at national level and specific local outcomes.
A new 3 year comparative Programme has therefore been mounted which, through a coordinated set of locality studies, aims to throw light on these linkages and to assess the importance to local economic and social adjustment of agencies responsible for such functions as development planning, employment creation and services delivery.
A budget of just over £300,000 was allocated for the Programme.
Philip Cooke, Department of Town Planning, UWIST, was appointed as Programme Coordinator.
Seven localities were selected for study.
They are split reasonably evenly between what are often perceived as the ‘poor’ North and the ‘prosperous’South, although not all the areas fit such a stereotype.
In parallel with the locality studies, a national level analysis of economic, social and political change in the UK since 1971 is being undertaken by the Programme Coordinator.
In view of the level of initial interest shown in the Programme, a series of regional meetings was held (in Spring 1985) which gave all those involved in locality research an opportunity to present papers based on their work.
The papers have since been published as a collection by ESRC (‘Global Restructuring, Local Response' ed Philip Cooke, 1986).
The study localities are: Middlesbrough; Lancaster; Outer Liverpool; S.W. Birmingham; Cheltenham; Swindin; Isle of Thanet.

The purpose of this project, funded by the ESRC under their ‘Open Door’ scheme is to investigate women's employment in the book publishing industry, an industry in which it is estimated between 50 and 70% of the workforce are female and yet a much smaller proportion of women are employed in senior decision making roles.
Through a survey of 6 publishing companies, differentiated by size and type, it is intended to develop both case studies of companies and research tools to be used in a later industry wide study.
We will interview company personnel managers in order to establish the relative numbers of men and women employed at different levels and in different departments and company policies in relation to equal opportunities.
We also intend to interview both male and female employees in order to explore their career aspirations and their perception of company policies and opportunities.
From this pilot study it is hoped to identify some of the characteristic features of the book publishing industry, and different company practices and policies, and to begin to assess their effect on careers, as well as to prepare for a wider study of the industry, with the longer term goal of developing strategies to improve women's position in publishing.

Official statements of UK and EEC environmental policy have recently given a high profile to the need to incorporate an environmental dimension into areas of public policy which up until now have been largely unaffected by such considerations.
The new weight given to what is termed ‘environmental integration’ will be a dominant policy theme during the next decade.
Yet evidence suggests that the practical implementation of such an approach is fraught with difficulties.
There is little agreement as to what the concept of integration implies, and the whole process is set against a backdrop of rapidly shifting opinion as to the legitimate scope of environmental policy itself.
The research is the first sustained investigation of the subject in this country.
The primary aim is to provide an authentic analysis of key legal, administrative, and policy themes which can be expected to be met during the development and implementation of a integrated approach.
Implications of the concept for the shape of public administration and environmental policy in the 1990's will be assessed.
The main method of research will be by personal interview and discussion with senior officials and other public figures.
A small number of existing areas of policy where limited moves towards greater integration have already been made will be chosen as case-studies for detailed analysis.

In the 1980's, competitive pressures have led many British companies to look for ways of using their employees more flexibly.
This may involve improving the ability of employees to handle different tasks and move between jobs; making more use of temporary and part time staff; or finding ways of rewarding multi-skilled or high performing employees.
Research studies have criticised companies for their piecemeal approach to increasing flexibility and, particularly in the service sector, for creating a low pay, low skill workforce through over reliance on part time and temporary staff.
The aim of the research is to explore current approaches to work flexibility in the hotel industry and identify ways of introducing flexible working to the benefit of hotel operators, their customers and employees.
The research involves an investigation of attitudes and approaches to flexible working within major hotel chains, based on interviews with corporate personnel managers.
A comparison is made between published research in the retail and financial sectors and practices in the British hotel industry.
In addition, a detailed case study of two hotels operated by Commonwealth Holiday Inns of Canada identifies present practices and attitudes, the needs for and the barriers against work flexibility in these hotels.

The private housing market in Northern Ireland is characterised by a high level of new development and by a growth in owner-occupation.
The research aims to investigate the effect of new development on the housing market and in particular to evaluate its impact on the price structure of specific property types.
The investigation considers the extent to which new patterns of access to the market have boosted residential development and examines whether initiatives such as co-ownership have widened access to the market.
In addition the research provides a basis for assessing the pattern for future private housing provision in the province.
The research builds upon the Northern Ireland Property Market Analysis Project (NIPMAP) established by the investigators in 1984.
The principal methods of investigation will be an on-going analysis of the data-base of property transactions developed under NIPMAP, a behavioral survey of co-ownership purchasers and interviews with property professionals operating in the market.

Conflicts in the countryside — especially between farming, forestry and conservation — have in places become so intense that they threaten not only the sound use of land resources but also the future prosperity of rural communities.
This research project focuses on attempts by local authorities to intervene in instances of rural land use competition, and to evaluate how effective their involvement has been.
One barrier to the regulation of rural land use change is the absence of planning controls over farming and forestry.
Notwithstanding this, a number of local authorities have already sought to act as ‘honest brokers’ between different environmental interests, principally by producing collaborative land use plans and convening steering committees composed of interested parties.
This research will examine whether a consensus-based solution is effective in practice, and will entail establishing the extent to which competition has been resolved and employment or amenity opportunities realised.
On the basis of the findings it is intended to ascertain effective management structures, and to identify the circumstances in which a collaborative approach may or may not work.
It is anticipated that the research will have particular application in the management of environmentally sensitive areas, and the diversification of rural landscapes.

The international competitiveness of British industry has been a major cause of concern for some considerable time.
Basically, a firm wishing to enter a foreign market has a choice of three methods, known as ‘market servicing strategies’.
— it can export its product for sale in the foreign country — it can appoint a foreign company to manufacture its product under licence — it can invest in the foreign country (i.e. obtain premises, plant and workforce there) and manufacture its own product abroad.
Professor Buckley and his team will be examining ways of predicting which of the three strategies will be most appropriate to the needs and circumstances of any particular company.
Moreover, market servicing strategies are not static.
They continually evolve as the firm and its products change and as market needs alter.
Consequently, the project will approach the problem in two ways.
Firstly, there will be a cross-sectional approach, looking at a wide range of firms and markets; and secondly, there swill be a time series approach, which will follow a firm's involvement with a particular national market over a period of time.
Another part of the research programme will formulate ways of defining and measuring successful competition abroad.
Professor Buckley will study a sample of British firms matched with similar German, Swedish and US firms evaluate their market servicing strategies in selected markets.
At the same time, he will be able to assess the impact on a firm of a change in its marketing strategy, for example a change from sales to production subsidiaries abroad.
Whilst many of the questions Professor Buckley will address remain to be answered, he suspects he already knows the causes of some of Britain's marketing problems abroad: ‘Basically we do not try hard enough, we do not invest enough and we do not choose our markets selectively enough.
At the end of this project, I hope we will be able to provide a set of reliable guidelines to help British companies improve their marketing strategies abroad’.

European volunteer workers were recruited by the British government from amongst the large refugee population in Displaced Persons camps in Germany and Austria at the end of the Second World war.
About 90,000 workers of mainly East European origin were employed to fill labour shortages in agriculture, coal-mining, textiles and hospital domestic work.
The scheme's novelty lies in the fact that it is the first instance of an officially sponsored immigration programme.
The research aims to explore the tension in government policy arising from the ambivalent status of the ‘volunteers’ as both migrant workers and refugees.
The research will also examine the ‘volunteers’ placement in British industry and the response of the trade union movement ot foreign labour.
An underlying aim to place this European migration within the broader context of Commonwealth immigration which began in the late 1940's with the arrival of Jamaicans to Britain.
The research on the European volunteer scheme will be carried out using a number of primary and documentary sources, in particular key government papers, held in the Public Record Office.Trade union reports, reports of voluntary organisations and of international organizations involved in resettling the refugees will also be consulted.

The past ten years have witnessed a tremendous growth in the number and variety of transport services provided by the transport sector.
These services share a common concern for the mobility and accessibility needs of a number of disadvantaged groups (e.g. disabled people, elderly and infirm individuals, youth groups, those on low incomes).
The research aims to explore how decisions are made in voluntary sector transport provisions.
It will explore how decisions involving different organizations are formulated and implemented.
It will assess the implications for the quality of service provision of different patterns of decision-making and planning both within and between the organizations involved.
The findings will be disseminated to agencies and bodies responsible for transport provision through the medium of training conferences, as well as through conventional academic channels.
The research will entail the examination of three contrasting case studies — a metropolitan-based group hire scheme, a transport brokerage project in a large provincial city, and a semi-urban community bus scheme.
The chief sources of information will be interviewing key participants in the making of decisions, detailed observation of meetings, and the examination of documents, such as minutes and policy statements.

This is a study of negotiation and adjudication in respect of financial and property issues on divorce.
Decisions on these matters (whether taken by the parties, their legal advisors, or the Court) involve critical value judgements, bearing in mind not only considerations of justice between the adults involved, but also the needs of the children.
Over 170,000 couples each year experience divorce in England and Wales; a growing proportion of these cases give rise to contested legal proceedings; finance and property disputes form the bulk of the litigation.
the outcome of these disputes will not only affect the standard of living of the parties and their children, but will help to determine such matters as future accommodation, need to rely on state benefits, scope for obtaining employment, and even the prospects of re-marriage.
The researchers will be assessing some aspects of the impact of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984.
This introduced important changes: it removed the requirement that the Court should seek to return the parties to the financial position which they would have been in had their marriage not broken down; it required the Court to give ‘first consideration’ to the welfare of any child of the family; and it contained a number of provisions designed, in appropriate cases, to emphasise the importance of the parties seeking to become self-sufficient after divorce.
But the ramifications of the study go well beyond the private law of finance and property on divorce.
Legislation and case law provides the framework within which negotiation is carried forward, but it the process of bargaining and settlement-seeking with which the researchers are primarily concerned.
Research Method.
A study of the conduct of litigation calls for an innovatory research design.
The researchers intend to monitor the progress of cases through the various legal stages.
They will take account of all the various perspectives (those of the parties, legal advisors and adjudicators) in order that these may be compared.
It is also the intention to match the expectations of the parties and their legal advisers against eventual outcome.
This strategy calls for the researchers to follow cases through from the point of initial application.
They will conduct preliminary interviews with the parties and solicitors; attend preliminary court hearings; study affidavits and other available documentation; observe the trial (if any); engage in post-hearing discussion with the registrar; and conduct follow-up interviews with the parties.
The research will be conducted at three centres.
The choice of courts has yet to be determined.

On January 1st 1984 the American Telephone and telegraph Company (AT and T), hithertofore the only supplier of nation-wide telecommunications services, was required to divest itself of its subsidiaries.
The judicial decision ended a monopoly and opened up competition not only in the provision of telecommunications services but also new developments in information technologies.
The defense Department, a major user of At and T services, found itself in a new position yet still charged with statutory requirements regarding national security, emergency preparedness and defence of national interests.
The purpose of the research is to investigate the reaction of the Dod to these changed circumstances, the response of the telecommunications industry to the new opportunities created, the reasoning behind new telecommunications regulations, and structural realignments in the relations between and within US government departments and Agencies and US telecommunications industries.
As a subsidiary question, can the US experience provide any lesson for post British Telecom privatization Britain?

The aim of this study is to trace the emergence and development of the political ideology of Ulster Unionism as a basis for understanding both how they perceive their national identity and position within the United Kingdom and also their reaction to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
It starts from the premise that the development of modern Ulster Unionism and the attitudes it embodies has to be studied in the context of the threat that Irish nationalism seemed to pose the Ulster protestants, as the demand for Irish independence brought their national identity into question.
With this in mind the Ulster Unionist perception of British values and traditions, the empire, Ulster and southern Irish nationalists is examined and an assessment made of the compatibility of these views with British thinking on these issues.
The analysis employed is based partly on party records and private papers, where they exist, but chiefly on an extensive range of Ulster local newspapers.
Special attention is paid to leading articles and reports of political speeches.
These are examined with the intention of establishing a ‘vocabulary’ of Unionism and to chart how it changed over the period as a whole.

The principle aims of the research are two-fold.
First, it will analyse the expenditure responses of local authorities to the new financial regime that the Local Government Finance Act will introduce.
This work will build on techniques developed in a current ESRC financed project which is concerned with modelling local authority expenditure decisions.
A central objective of the reforms introduced in the Act is the achievement of accountability in local government finance.
Given the government's definition of accountability, under the existing system of local government finance some local authorities face a more accountable regime than do others.
The research will analyse whether expenditure changes are related to the change in the degree of accountability faced by different local authorities.
The first part of the research will focus on local authorities' total expenditure, whilst the second principle objective of the research will be to investigate whether the reforms lead to a change in the pattern of service provision.
Under the new regime the full marginal cost of expenditure will fall on community charge payers and thus the marginal cost of services will vary between local authorities.
The research will investigate the extent to which these differences in marginal cost are systematically reflected in differences in levels of service provision.

Braille is still the most important form of written communication for the blind throughout the world.
Yet it is difficult to learn, and is often read very slowly.
Previous evidence has shown that fluent braille involves a number of subsidiary perceptual, cognitive and manual skills.
But it is not known how these skills relate to levels of proficiency or to the process of acquisition.
The aim of the proposed research is to investigate how the subsidiary skills relate to the development of braille reading, to identify the sources of difficulty at different levels of proficiency, and to test application for improving reading speed and accuracy.
The principal method is to use a video-recording device which was developed for a study of fluent braille, supported by the ESRC (1984–1986).
The device records hand and finger movements from below transparent surfaces during reading, together with voice output and (1/100 sec) timing.
The device has the advantage that people can read normally, while extremely fine details of the text being touched at any one moment are being filmed.
In the proposed research experimental manipulations of the texts will be used to study effects of physical features, spelling, sound and meaning on braille speed and accuracy.

Mergers and takeovers are among the more controversial activities of companies.
Reports of takeover ‘conflicts’ are widely publicised and provoke considerable debate on the gains and losses caused by the takeover.
This project investigates the effects of takeovers and mergers which have occurred in the ten year period from 1975.
The first part of the project will be concerned with identifying the effects of the mergers on the owners (i.e. the shareholders) of the firms involved.
In particular the study will be investigating whether different types of merger (e.g. horizontal) influence the distribution of gains and losses between the shareholders of the companies which instigate the merger or takeover and the shareholders of the companies which are taken over.
The second part of the study focuses on horizontal mergers.
It examines whether the shareholders of the acquiring firms gain from the takeover because their firm has become more efficient or because it has become more powerful and monopolistic.
In both parts of the study the research methods will be based on the analysis of the behaviour of the share prices of the companies involved in the mergers.

British universities have been strongly influenced by the actions of many governments, and none more so than the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
However, the manner in which that influence has been exercised has changed over time.
Formerly the universities were granted considerable day-to-day autonomy within a legal framework shaped byu the state.
Contemporarily the state, through administrative and financial controls, has lessened that autonomy while allowing the universities to reshape with comparative ease their governing statutes.
The purpose of this project is to examine, through a case study approach, the relationship between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the state since 1920.
How has the balance of power between the state and the universities, and between the colleges and the universities, shifted over time?
Those two universities have represented the collegiate model of a university.
How and why has the state attempted to restructure that model?
What instruments has it employed and with what degree of success has it pursued the task of reform?
This is not to assume either that there has never been pressure within the universities for change or that the state is necessarily hostile to the collegiate model.
This is as much a story of internally generated reform and state genuflection to Oxbridge as it is of institutional conflict and change.
At the theoretical level this research builds on our previous work by examining the relationship between political and administrative pressures for change; the former channelled through the political parties and their governments and the latter through the various branches of the state bureaucracy.

The 1970 Cohort Study is a longitudinal study of children born in England, Scotland and Wales between 5th and 11th April, 1970.
Three national surveys were carried out between 1970 and 1981.
The British Births Survey of 1970 collected information on all babies born alive or dead and their mothers, during the birth week.
In 1975, 13,135 children were recontacted at the age of 5 years, and, in 1980-1, 14,906 children were recontacted at the age of 10 years.
Together, these three surveys form a multi-faceted longitudinal study of the health and development of a national sample of British children.
There have been a number of subsample surveys including surveys of twins, small-for-dates and post mature babies and a ten percent random sample of legitimate births, at the ages of 22 months and three and a half years.
The current project will involve a detailed audit of the data held on magnetic tapes collected during the first ten years of the children's lives.
This is necessary to determine the amount of cleaning, checking and editing to be done before deposition of the data with the Data Archive is possible.
External consultants and Data Archive consultants will assist in designing the most cost-effective way of preparing the data for deposition.
On completion of this project a detailed specification of the work to be done and the costs involved will be submitted to the ESRC.

In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in increasing the prominence given to science teaching during the primary school years.
In response to this, there have been many ingenious proposals relating to the introduction of scientifically relevant phenomena.
However, very little progress has been made in leading children towards conventionally accepted explanations.
The present project assumes that the lack of progress stems, in part, at least , from the methods employed.
The methods generally required children to work on their own.
However, there is reason to believe that with scientific explanations, the optimal approach would involve discussions between groups of children, so long as the children start with differing but partially relevant ideas.
The project intends to test this possibly by investigating the impact of group discussion on children's explanations of floating and sinking, and of motion down an inclines plane.
To facilitate practical application, the project will take place in ordinary classrooms using methods which, though experimental in nature will be readily assimilable into school curricula.
Following a method which has been successfully piloted, children will be grouped on the basis of individual pre-tests so that their initial explanations are either in agreement or in conflict.
Group discussions will take place, followed by immediate and delayed post-tests to measure degree of change.The expectation will be greater advancement amongst the children whose discussion partners held conflicting views.

Much analysis of public transport use has been based simply on estimating the number of single (one-way) trips made by passengers.
However, a more realistic approach is to see trips as forming a chain, linking activities through the day.
The study will examine this issue in relation to recent major developments in public transport in Britain, including the use of travelcards (permitting extra trips at zero money cost, and hence stimulating more complex trip chains): the role of minibuses (offering much higher service frequencies), and of bus deregulation.
In the last case, more complex patterns of use may have been discouraged by fragmentation of networks and ticketing systems.
Use will be made of travel diary and panel data already collected by other organisations.
Implications for the marketing and planning of public transport services will be identified.
The study will be linked with a follow-up survey of minibuses in Britain, being undertaken by the same researchers on behalf of the Transport & Road Research Laboratory.

The system of concepts which human beings employ is one of an infinite number of possible systems.
Is the system that we work with (natural concepts) easier for us to acquire than other systems?
To what extent is it ‘written in’ to our mental capacity?
There are two features of natural concepts that I shall be investigating.
First, natural concepts remain within basic categories: living things, artifacts, abstractions, events, etc.
We do not, for example, tend to have words which refer to both sentient beings and to events.
Are young children naturally inclined to find non-natural concepts which do straddle these categories relatively difficult to learn?
I shall be introducing children to examples of natural and non- natural concepts via illustrated stories.
I shall look at the relative learnability of these concepts across age.
The second aspect of natural concepts with which I shall be concerned is their conjunctive nature.
our concepts are normally definable by a conjunction of attributes, e.g. ‘spinster’ means adult and female and unmarried.
We do not concepts like ‘grue’ meaning ‘either green or blue’.
Such a non-natural concept is disjunctive.
I shall be looking at the relative learnability of conjunctive and disjunctive concepts across age, using block-sorting and discrimination-learning tasks.

Blackburn has had a high level of female participation in its labour market for over a century.
A high proportion of married women work outside the home.
The town therefore contains a wide variety of household employment structures, ranging from those where both married partners are in full-time employment, through part-time employment, and unemployment, to non-employment (this last including sick, retired, keeping house, caring for dependents, etc.).
Consequently, it is an ideal location which to study in detail the interrelation between the structure of employment in the labour market and the structure of the domestic division of labour: that is, how work outside the home affects work inside the home, and vice versa .
Both partners in 40 households are being interviewed, some with children and some without.
The sample is being selected from an earlier survey which examined household structure, work and histories and current employment status.
The interviews update employment histories and focus on domestic activities, responsibilities and attitudes towards the performance of household tasks.

There is widespread support for two recommendations, that history has an important place in the National Curriculum and that teachers should be sensitive to the developmental needs of children.
Yet there has been almost no research into primary school children's developing historical competence.
Two studies will be carried out.
One study will involve teachers of upper and lower juniors who are skilled at teaching history topics.
A variety of techniques will be used to chart their general beliefs about child development, as well as their specific estimates of what children of given ages might normally be expected to achieve in history.
A second study will examine lessons which the teachers reckon to embody good practice, first to chart how good, primary school history teaching proceeds, and secondly, to clarify the relationship between the planned and the delivered curriculum, with particular reference to the way teachers combine the disciplinary demands of teaching history with the need to adapt the discipline to their conception of child development.
It is expected that the findings offered to the academic community will be complemented by more descriptive works oriented to trainee and experienced teachers.

Fear for personal security can be a major factor affecting travel decisions.
Fears are greatest among vulnerable groups, such as women and the elderly, in inner city areas during darkness but the problem is by no means restricted to these people, places and times.
Transport operators and local authorities are beginning to establish schemes aimed at countering both crime and fear of crime.
Many of these schemes change the environment in which crime might be committed, for example by better street lighting or closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance.
However, these proposals are not based currently on thorough understanding of the consequences.
This research will provide that basis by monitoring the effectiveness of a City Council scheme in Southampton to re-light and install CCTV in a subway system near the City Centre.
Crime statistics, pedestrian activity and public perceptions of security will all be monitored before and after scheme installation.
Surveys will also probe how travellers consider and weight personal security among the various factors affecting journey decisions.
This more theoretical aspect should provide a better basis for urban designers and transport planners considering personal security issues.
The study, which follows on from a pilot study funded by ESRC, involves the Departments of Civil Engineering and Law.

As part of its strategy for public participation in the Belfast Urban Area Plan 1987-2001, the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland grant aided the voluntary organisation Community Technical Aid (CTA) to assist community groups in their responses to the new plan.
Most of this exercise took the form of a team of planners working closely with community groups in the run up to, and during, the Public Inquiry into the Draft Plan.
This took place in the early summer of 1988.
The purpose of the research is to investigate the background to the decision by the department to employ CTA to manage participation, to describe and appraise CTA's outreach work, to identify common themes arising from community groups' objections, to describe and analyze the strategy which CTA adopted during the Public Inquiry, and to draw general conclusions about this approach to democratising planning and urban policy.
The principal methods of investigation are interviewing and the collation of documentary evidence.

This project forms part of the research initiative ‘The Educational Needs of a Multiracial Society’.
It has three main aims.
The first aim is to document the inter-relationships amongst children's ethnic identity and preference, self esteem, and sociometric (friendship) status in the classroom.
How extensive is ethnic preference?
Do more prejudiced children differ in their popularity and self esteem?
The second aim is to see how the above measures over the course of a school year.
Does ethnic preference increase, or decline?
How do such changes relate to friendship changes?
The third aim is to pilot out the effectiveness od a co-operative group work curriculum as a means of enhancing inter-racial co-operation and attitudes to other ethnic groups.
This has been found to be effective in the USA.
The research is being carried out in three middle schools within the Sheffield LEA.
In each school, two classes will be monitored through the year; one of these two classes will in addition experience an enhanced co-operative group work intervention.

Research completed recently, funded by ESRC, indicated that marketing is the most poorly managed part of the innovation process in high technology small firms.
It was maintained that small amounts of assistance to firms could result in measurable improvements in the sales of products of assisted firms.
The project beginning in September will include a time-series study of marketing in a sample of high technology small firms in Scotland and South East England.
The second part of study will focus on the problem areas identified in a number of firms through the initial survey; the researchers will work with these firms to give small amounts of assistance aimed at easing some of the marketing bottlenecks.
The impact of this assistance on the group of firms will be measured and compared with experiences of an unassisted control group of firms in each region.
This will allow an evaluation of the costs and benefits of a more proactive approach to small firm assistance.
Detailed information on the marketing activities of these firms will allow an examination of the role of marketing in the innovation process.

This research project examines the experience of ethnic minority children at the point where they first come into contact with educational system, ie in nursery schools.
At a preschool stage children already require certain kinds of educational experiences, and quite a lot is now known as to what these are and how they should be delivered.
The question arises whether children of different ethnic groups have equal access to such experiences, even within the same nursery and from the same teacher.
The principal aim of the project is to provide an answer to this question.
We shall accordingly analyse staff-child interaction styles, as they occur both as part of the general routine of the nursery and in number of specially set-up key situations.
Data on differential behaviour so obtained will be related to a number of factors, in particular teachers' conceptions of their role vis-a-vis ethnic minority children and the ethnic composition of the nursery (few or many minority children).
It is believed that the observational material will be useful in highlighting subtle aspects of differential behaviour and therefore be of particular help in staff training schemes.

STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION ABS:In recent years firms faced with the rising cost performing research and development necessary to remain competitive have sought to spread the cost and risk by collaborating with other firms.
Frequently this collaboration is across international boundaries.
This research aims to identify what lies behind successful collaboration and to draw lessons about best practice in the formulation and management of collaboration.
Particular emphasis is being placed upon comparing those collaborations which happen spontaneously and those which take place within a publicly sponsored programme.
We also are comparing collaborations with different international partners.
Current models of collaborative research assume that companies pool their resources at the pre-competitive R&D phase and the apply results individually in a competitive environment.
Empirical studies of the Alvey and ESPRIT programmes for advanced IT have shown that a far wider range of motivations and structures for collaborations exist.
This research is constructing a taxonomy of collaboration against which to categorise them.
10-15 case studies, covering a range of circumstances, will form the basis of the project, which will also draw data collected by PREST in previous studies.
The management of the firms will be involved in an interactive process of examination of collaboration through structured
interviews with those responsible for company strategy and those responsible for the day to day management of collaboration.
A working group will discuss particular issues arising from collaboration.

Until recently women have been considered to be at low risk from HIV and AIDS, and attention has been focussed on so-called high risk groups.
Recent evidence calls this focus into question, and indicates that the spread of AIDS is a matter of high risk practices rather than group membership.
The potential role of young women in this process has yet to be fully explored.
The research aims to explore the sexual practices, beleifs and understanding of young women.
We will investigate the practical implications of the sexual knowledge and behaviour of young women for the spread of HIV infection.
Two groups in inner city areas of London and Manchester will be studied, using a range of research methods.
The study will produce a detailed description and analysis of what young women know about sexuality and about AIDS; the ideas which they have about risk, danger and control in sexual encounters; how they behave sexually; why they behave as they do, and what factors are likely to constrain or to encourage change in their behaviour.
The practical application of the study is directly revelant to the containment of the AIDS epidemic.
The information gathered will also be relevancy to changing other aspects of health care related to women's sexual behaviour, such as pregnancy, cervical cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases.
The work will provide information on the efficacy of current government health programmes and will offer practical recommendations which will have policy implications in the field of health and sex education.

One aim of the research project is to examine the relationship between the perception of accident causes and the perception of countermeasure effectiveness.
A distinction will be made between the perception of casual factors in the general population and casual factors which may be linked to personal accidents.
Research in other fields suggests that judgements of personal risk may differ from judgements of societal risk.
There are a variety of biases which safety researchers face.
‘It won't happen to me’ is one of the more prevalent.
This will be investigated to see whether this is an optimism bias in which individuals perceive they are less vulnerable than other people to negative life events or whether this is an illusion of control bias which people overestimate their own abilities.
This general type of bias may be due to a selective memory search for information favouring a positive personal outcome.
One potential countermeasure which will be explored is to direct memory serach to contradictory evidence such as the individual's own driving errors.
The aim of this approach will be to find techniques which either eliminate or reduce the bias.

Competition between firms today is concentrated on technological knowledge, information and research.
For a firm to succeed it is as necessary to efficiently manage its knowledge resources as it is its labour and capital.
This new dynamic competition comes from products and processes which threaten a firm's knowledge base and challenge its dominant competence to enhance its current knowledge base or to establish a new one.
This project will attempt to show that when firms are experiencing this dynamic competition they will respond by augmenting their knowledge base.
One form which it is believed that this move takes is to new types of collaboration between commercial enterprise and public sector science.
To demonstrate this the project will construct and characterise the knowledge base of a number of firms, to describe the range of ways in which firms identify short comings in respect to some aspect of their knowledge resources and to analyse how they respond to acquire new external knowledge.
An appropriate selection of firms will be made whose knowledge base is currently threatened by new technology or a novel design configuration.
This will include large and small firms from a range of technologies in both new and mature areas.
This will provide the information necessary to examine the context, origin and establishment of the linkages with public sector science.
In the light of these findings conclusions will be drawn regarding the appropriateness for the enhancement of the firm ‘s knowledge base of the various linkage mechanisms examined.

This study will examine the past and current role of National Research Laboratories in both the defence and science/ technology ‘systems’ with a view to informing policy debate on their future roles.
National Research Laboratories are large, publicly owned defence research and development establishments.
Through their size, funding and concentration of personnel they are central scientific and technological establishments.
Despite some speculation on the extent of their influence in shaping and informing defence policy this has not so far been subject to any systematic analysis.
A comparative approach will be taken, the comparison being between the UK and the US.
Particular questions to be considered include: i to what extent has the emergence of new military technology from the laboratories been steered by strategic interests and too what extent was it an autonomous product of the laboratories; ii how has the relationship between the work done in the national laboratories to that done by defence contractors altered; iii what are the pressures for greater commercial application of research; what effect has this had?
The study will select, on the basis of a general preliminary investigation, a number of NRLs in both the UK and US to investigate in detail.
These will be visited and extensive interviews conducted of current and former staff.
A document and literature search will also be made.

Poor readers have attracted increased attention of late.
It is now apparent that poor readers can be meaningfully divided into two groups.
One group holds those who read at low levels but who are ‘doing as well as can be expected’.
The other group holds those who read at levels well below the level expected of them.
Those of the first group have been called low achieving readers, and those of the second group underachieving readers.
Those who have been identified as ‘dyslexic; will necessarily be underachieving readers but not all underachieving readers will necessarily be ‘dyslexic’.
This research focuses on the french perspective to the relationship between ‘dyslexia’ and underachievement in reading.
It will involve reviewing the appropriate governmental legislation and identifying the extent to which this legislation is embraced so as to enhance the teaching of reading for both low achieving and underachieving readers.

The purpose of this study is to examine the handling of complaints made by individuals or organizations against government departments, using as examples H.M. Customs and Excise and the Immigration and Nationality Department.
The focus will be upon the routine ways in which the majority of complaints are dealt with inside these organizations, although more formal procedures will also be looked at.
The researchers will follow the progress of samples of complaints through the internal channels, and will interview those who deal with them.
In addition, they will question a sample of complainants to determine how satisfied they were with the response.
Specific topics addressed will include the attitudes of staff towards complaints and complainants, the degree of consistency in their responses, and the extent to which departments ‘learn’ from complaints for example, by reviewing policy or practice after an individual case or as a result of recognising patterns.
Particular attention will be paid to complaints channelled through Members of Parliament, those with the backing of prominent pressure groups and those investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Investigation.

Micro-electronic technology is now being introduced into service organisations on a growing scale.
It is expected to have a considerable impact upon the quality of services offered to the public, upon the level and quality of employment in service organisations and upon their management.
This project examines the process whereby micro-electronics is being introduced, and its consequences, in three service sectors: banking, hospital care and retail distribution.
These sectors have been chosen for several reasons: their services are provided for wide sections of the community; they are major employers; and new technology is being introduced into their central work activities.
The project carries out comparative cases studies in each sector focusing on how the decisions were made to introduce new micro-electronic technology and to re-design the organisation of work accordingly.
There is a study of the consequent changes to jobs, skill and training requirements, levels of employment, organisation and management, services to clients and the well-being of employees.
Parallel projects to this one are planned for several other European countries.
It is hoped that international comparisons will throw further light upon the availability of alternative ways of applying new technology within the same sectors of activity.

The programme of education reforms currently being introduced by the British Government requires all state maintained schools to introduce more or less simultaneously several major innovations, together with any changes initiated by LEAs and by the schools, while attempting to maintain the quality of their ongoing work.
This initial exploratory study aims to identify how schools cope with the introduction of several innovations at once, to develop theory on the management of planned change, and to develop methods of monitoring the processes involved in managing multiple innovations.
Existing theory in this area provides limited guidance for practitioners as it is based on the management of single innovations.
A case study will be undertaken of one primary and one secondary school in the same LEA, focusing mainly on the work of the headteacher, senior staff and other teachers in planning, preparing for and introducing the changes.
In addition several of the LEA personnel involved in supporting the schools will be interviewed.
A second primary and secondary school will be studied to see whether the findings from the case study schools apply to schools elsewhere.
Research methods will include interviews, a survey of relevant documents, a questionnaire and limited observation.

Over the past few years the media across Europe have devoted increasing attention to what is often sen as an upsurge of political activity by ordinary citizens.
These have taken the form of protest meetings, marches and other types of direct action over a variety of issues.
In particular there have been a number of publicised protests over environmental issues, involving nuclear waste, air pollution and the development of major engineering projects.
The question therefore arises as to how far these forms of citizen action are growing and are going to supplement much more conventional types of political participation such as voting and contacting elected representatives and officials.
The conference at Manchester, funded jointly by the ESRC and the European Science Foundation, brings together scholars from Europe who will review the current state of political participation, both electoral and non-electorial Is participation on the increase?
What sorts of people tend to become politically active and who tend to remain relatively inert?
Are the citizen ‘spectators’ coming from the stands onto the political playing fields?
How are political leaders reacting to participation?
Such issues are clearly important ones for the future vitality of European democratic institutions.

The objective of this pilot was to explore the possibility of setting up Anglo-French comparative studies on the involvement of the users of public services in their planning and delivery.
Although the two systems of government differ in a number of key respects, sufficient similarities exist to suggest that further work would be justified.
In both countries, users of services have achieved much greater political visibility.
Arrangements were accordingly made to visit Centre d'Etude et de Recherche sur la Vie Locale (CERVL) at Bordeaux, in order to establish working contacts with a number of French colleagues who are addressing these and other similar issues.
The intention is to provide the basis for future collaboration on issues related to the management and delivery of public services in the two countries.

Research summary.
The primary aim of the project has been to utilise micro data sets in the rigorous empirical decisions in the presence of credit market imperfections.
The most important policy-related questions concern the impact of potential credit market constraints: were they binding in the UK in the s and s?
Did they cease to bind in the early s when various legal restrictions were removed?
Did the removal of these restrictions contribute to the consumption boom of the late s?
A related issue concerns empirical methodology.
Research to date has most often used either a failure of the life-cycle model (usually with excess sensitivity to income) to infer credit market restrictions or, using micro data, has separated households into unconstrained and potentially constrained using prior information.
Both of these approaches have problems.
An aim of this project was therefore to use and develop ways of identifying the existence and importance of binding constraints using alternative approaches, while still within the confines of a rigorous theoretical model.
Partly as a result of the methodology chosen, a subsidiary aim was to examine the links between expenditure on durable as opposed to non-durable goods.
In particular, can the utility function be shown to be separate between these two types of goods?
Finally, we aimed to compare the experience of the UK with other countries.
To this end we collaborated with researchers in the US and Italy to use similar approaches using US and Italian data.

Increased commercial development pressures and the relaxation of planning regulation in the countryside have excited widespread public concern.
In this climate, the idea of planning gain has been floated as a means of reconciling development and conservation by making a ‘green’ component, such a nature reserve, a necessary condition for permitting a development scheme to go ahead.
The research aims to establish just how such ‘gains’ might be generated from the commercial development of land by looking at the roles of, relationships between, public and private interests in shaping the development process.
Selected rural planning authorities will be investigated in detail to assess existing experiences of the process and outcome of planning gain negotiations in a variety of local contexts, representing areas subject to different kinds of development pressure and planning policy.
By assessing existing experience and considering possible alternative forms of intervention in the development process, a full evaluation can be made of the potential contribution of planning gain to regulating the development of rural land in ways which protect and enhance countryside habitat, landscape and amenity.

It is widely recognised that agricultural resources produce far more than a supply of raw foodstuffs.
The development of the rural environment is critically dependant on the responses of farmers to both market and policy signals.
This research will develop a farm model system which captures environmental and land use interactions at the farm and field level.
A set of illustrative farm types and situations will be extensively modelled.
The choice of the farms systems to be modelled will be based on related research on land use underway at Newcastle.
Particular known farms will also be modelled and tested against their known histories and responses.
Once the basic farm model system is developed and validated, it will be used to explore farm-level land use and environmental interactions for a variety of different circumstances and locations.
Related research is exploring these relationships at the national and river basin level, so that the farm-level work will be able to provide greater detail on specific ground level relationships, and on the factors which variability in response.
The likely effects of different policy instruments, such as set-aside, management agreements and land designations, in conjunction with different market situations will then be investigated.

This project considers pay developments since 1970 by analysis of the New Earnings Survey.
Permission to use the Survey has been granted by the Department of Employment and this makes feasible a much more sophisticated analysis than is possible with the published data alone.
Some thirteen investigators from seven institutions have been brought together to examine various dimensions of the data set; some of the areas to be covered will be public sector/ private sector relationships, manual skill differentials, sex differentials, white-collar pay movements, the dispersion of pay, pay in relation to hours worked, shift work and incentive pay, the role of national collective agreements, and pay according to region, age and size of plant.
Certain common variables are being developed, and it is expected that a joint publication reviewing pay since 1970 will be produced, as well as a series of publications relating to the various dimensions separately.

Mining booms moved men and money in vast numbers and quantities across the world throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
In many respects, the mining frontier in colonial and foreign countries moved through the City of London's major capital markets: gold and silver strikes in far-away places captured the imagination of different types of investors and speculators creating segmented share markets such as the ‘Kaffir Circus’ and ‘the Jungle’.
The importance of the mining sector in the City's international role of capital export has been underestimated by historians, who have, in most cases, drawn a broad picture of British investment overseas in her imperial prime.
The project, by focusing on mining capital markets, hopes to contribute to an important re-assessment of the size and significance of British overseas investment.
Data collected by the project will be made available to other researchers.

The research is concerned with the ways in which Hindu parents bring up their children in Britain in accordance with their own traditions.
Some Hindu parents send their children to special classes, in addition to their normal schooling.
Yet, little is known about such classes, and even less about how parents endeavour to bring up their children as Hindus outside the context of these classes.
The research thus aims to address the following questions:
What do Hindu parents conceive of as essential to the education of their children as Hindus?
How do they seek to bring up their children in accordance with these conceptions?
How do they view their children's schooling in the light of their own educational values and practices?
What do the children know about the Hindu culture of their communities and how do they interpret and evaluate that knowledge?
The research is carried out in London, concentrating on Gujarati Hindus, since most Hindus in Britain are Gujaratis.
Data are collected from parents and children, primarily through standard anthropological methods.
As well as illuminating a relatively unexplored area, the research should be useful to educationalists and others working with Hindu children.

The project arises from research into major ‘gaps’ between the structure and content of school curricula and the rapidly changing environment in which they are located.
In response to the difficult situation schools find themselves in, a critical and forward-looking approach to curriculum renewal was developed.
This work is carried forward in the present project.
A systematic framework for the study and evaluation of ‘futures’ units, modules and courses is being developed.
The early results are applied
(a)
seeking to develop the theory and practice of education in relation to the critical study of futures, and
(b)
testing a variety of propositions (about preparation for work, leisure or unemployment) in the context of the 14 to 16 curriculum.
The project seeks a balance between constructive criticisms of existing curricula and concrete proposals for innovative developments which respond actively to changing conditions in the wider world.
It is envisaged that the educational use of futures tools and techniques will require new, interactive, forms of software.
The overall aim is to show in detail how schools can mediate between past and future without attempting to copy the former or to naively predict the latter.
The view is taken that futures perspectives are already implicit in the work of schools, but largely unexamined.

No one has had a greater influence on intellectual life in twentieth century Spain than Jos'e Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955).
However, there is very little work on Ortega available to an English-speaking readership.
This research aims to open up Ortega's multi-faceted life and character so as to reveal his philosophical innovations and sociological contributions.
Specifically, Ortega seeks to restore concrete human life to the centre-stage of philosophical preoccupation.
He criticises abstract system-building; the belief that the use of pure, speculative reason can supply the secrets of the universe; and seeks to steer between absolute and relative conceptions of truth with his notion of ‘perspectivism’.
Again, Ortega's reflections on politics provide an excellent sounding-board for discussion of the events of the years 1900-1931: a period crucial to an understanding of the causes and result of the Spanish Civil War.
His belief in the inevitability of ‘elites (and the dangers of fighting that inevitability) led him to a suspicion of equality and a hostility to demagogic politics of any variety.

The aim is to seek out and to collect contemporary representations drawn in the main from the period 1750-1900 of law courts, lawyers, judges, magistrates, police, prisoners, prisons, forms of punishments.
The representations may be in the form of prints, sketches, drawings, paintings, photographs or sculptures.
They may exist in their own right or they may be illustrations in a book.
Portraits of individuals are not included within this aim.
A collection of such material should enhance our knowledge of the factors which contributed to change in law and society.
It may also enhance our understanding of contemporary legal institutions and practices.
For example, a representation of a law court could tell us something about the role of judges, lawyers, jury, witnesses: representations of the silent system within prisons may convey something of the nature of that practice.
To establish a collection it will be necessary to research the holdings of a number of galleries, museums and libraries.

With the exception of historical research on naval agreements in the 1920s and 1930s, arms control at sea was neglected until the late 1970s.
Interest has increased in the late 1980s as the Superpowers have taken advantage of a period of detente to consider the viability of smaller defence establishments.
The research aims to examine the potential for maritime arms control measures beyond the draft Strategic Arms 1990s, there are likely to be significant political and international developments (from budgetary problems in the US to pressure on overseas bases) which will affect the West's ability to continue deploying at current levels of naval levels of naval superiority.
The research will examine the extent to which reductions in naval strengths can become part of the wider negotiated arms control process.
The investigation will involve interviews with policy-makers and naval commentators in the United States, the Soviet Union, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
This survey follows a study supported by the British Academy and Nuffield Foundation, into problems over nuclear-capable warship visits to foreign ports.
It will complement existing research on nuclear non-proliferation in the University of Southampton's Centre for International Policy Studies.

This study will examine the history of the Ministry of Technology (MINTEC) with reference to defence research and development (R&D) and procurement practices.
Particular attention will be paid to how these were linked to civil research and development and industrial policies.
MINTEC was established in 1964 to help revitalise British industry through the application of technology.
In 1966 its role was expanded when it took over the Ministries of Aviation and Fuel and Power.
From this point MlNTEC controlled most of government spending on R&D, including defence.
The formation of MINTEC was an attempt to bring together civil and military R&D and procurement which reflected a desire to expand interventionist expertise from the military to the civil sector.
The intention was to produce a coherent policy on the development of civil and military technology.
This policy was later reversed in the 1970's when procurement was transferred to a department within the Ministry of Defence.
Previous studies of MINTEC have primarily concentrated on aspects of science policy planning, which has neglected the question of procurement policy.
In redressing this neglect the study will examine the following issues: i The reasoning behind the policy of integration.
ii The relations between the Ministry of Defence and MINTEC. iii The extent to which MINTEC changed the direction of defence R&D.
iv The extent to which MINTEC co-ordinated military and civil R&D policy.
v Why the link was split by the formation of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence.
In conducting this study the researcher will be drawing on previous work on the relationship between science, technology, industry and the military in Britain
The research will be based on Government and Parliamentary publications, private papers (such as at the Curchill Archives Centre and Kings College, London) and possibly the papers of The Rt.
Hon.
Anthony Wedgwood Benn.
Interviews will be conducted with former ministers, civil servants, serving officers and scientists and technologists in the Ministries of Aviation, Technology, Defence and the Treasury.

The project will examine the structural changes that have taken place in industrial and procurement policies in defence in the 1980's and consider their implications for future planning.
In recent years the role of government establishments in defence research has declined and the involvement of industrial firms has increased.
Research into technological innovation has generally assumed that although shifts have occurred they have been within a stable organisational framework.
The project questions this assumption and asserts that existing structures are in fact shifting both in the civil and military sectors and nationally and internationally.
These changes have created conflicts and tensions such as between old and new technological trajectories and between national autonomy and international co-operation.
In examining these conflicts and changes the particular aims of the researchers are to: elucidate the changes that occurred in the UK defence science and technology system in the 1980's and to analyse their dynamics and interactions; ii identify and examine the assumptions about the future being made by firms and governments to guide their current decision-making in this area; iii consider whether clear and stable structural trends are emerging, and the factors that may influence them in the 1990's, including the transition to a single European market; iv establish a better framework for assessing contemporary developments in defence technology policy and their consequences for other areas of science and technology policy.
Aerospace and electronics have been chosen as case studies, these sectors being representative of the defence sector in general but sufficiently different to provide useful comparisons.
The research will be conducted through an examination of the literature and interviews with leading defence contractors and R&D establishments.
The data collected will also contribute more widely to this area of research

During the 1980s, there has been a radical restructuring of the electrical engineering industries.
Manufacturers of equipment for telecommunications, defence electronics and household appliances have merged or entered joint ventures to ensure their continued competitiveness.
Such a process is now under way in the international power plant equipment industry.
This research aims to investigate the factors that underlie the current restructuring of that sector.
The project will draw upon the considerable prior expertise and resources of the SPRU Energy Programme, particularly the Power Plant Data Base which was established in 1969.
The project will comprise three parts, the first preliminary part consisting of a strengthening of the Power Plant Data Base in a number of key areas.
The second and most substantial part of the project will be an investigation, through direct interviews, of the strategies of the major international suppliers in Europe, the USA, and Japan.
The third part will draw the work together to establish whether the effect of the changes in the supply and demand side of the heavy electrical industry will lead to a more efficient market structure and assess the role of national and international authorities in improving the functioning of this market.

In 1980 the Scottish Branch of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) set up a study group to examine the range of international issues experienced in the Arctic area and the northern seas linking Canada, Scandinavia and the Soviet Union.
Topics discussed were those of resource exploration and exploitation — winning oil and gas and fish catches from the area; environmental problems; the legal aspects of dividing offshore resources; and traditional security issues.
Members of the group include academics, civil servants and representatives of commerce and industry.
The group has recently been supported by the ESRC and has run meetings on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Russian-Norwegian offshore disputes.
The NSR involves plans to open an all-year-round shipping route from north Norway to the Far East along Russia's northern coast.
Progress in the solving offshore jurisdictional dispute between Norway and Russia could lead to the two sides exploring for oil off their northern coasts.
Group members have published a number of books and articles and have linked in with other ESRC supported projects on Arctic co-operation.

There has been a remarkable growth in the amount of space and time devoted to environment issues in the mass media.
Many people believe that the increased coverage is contributing to the ‘greening of public opinion’ but detailed research evidence to support that assumption has not been carried out.
The overall objective of the study is to provide the Nature Conservancy Council and other environmental organisations with an improved understanding of how people make sense of news about nature conservation and act upon it.
The research will provide a detailed analysis of how news about nature conservation generated by these organisations is transformed and interpreted by media personnel and ordinary people.
One of the major objectives is to contribute to a better understanding of how the scientific constructs used to represent the objectives and practices of nature conservation in the United Kingdom can be communicated more effectively to the general public.
The project will combine quantitive and qualitative methods of research.
In particular, it will further extend the use of in-depth discussion groups which were pioneered in an earlier study of popular vales for open space which was funded by the ESRC and the Countryside commission between 1985-7.

The aim of this project is to analyse the political and institutional implications of closer European police cooperation in the context of the probable abolition in January 1993 of most border controls in Europe.
Although it is generally assumed that the free movement of persons within the European Community will increase the impact of ‘international crime’ on the internal security problems of the Member States and that more intensive and more effective law enforcement co-operation will be required, there is uncertainty about how better co-ordination can be achieved.
Many questions have been raised about the issues, including the opportunities for interagency co-operation, the methods of crime investigation and repression, the regulation of police accountability, and the protection of civil rights.
Data will be collected and evaluated from a different variety of sources on existing systems of law-enforcement co-operation, international agreements, transfrontier criminality, policy proposals, training systems and international exchange programmes.
Interviews with senior officials, police officers, politicians and human rights lawyers is the main research technique, complemented by a documentary analysis (newspaper reports; government reports; academic papers etc.).
The aim is to assess specific proposals for and different scenarios of European police co-operation against the standards of efficiency, accountability and the respect for individual rights.

The main objective of the project is to improve our understanding of the processes by which dominant firms achieve and maintain dominance in their markets and industries; to explore the determinants of profitability of these firms (especially the role of investment in R&D), particularly where they are apparently able to earn high profits persistently over time; to evaluate their dynamic efficiency in terms of new products, improved quality and cost-reducing new technology; and to inform and strengthen the policy analysis of dominant firms.
This will be achieved through the compilation of a statistical database relating to the development in the last twenty years of the 200-300 largest UK manufacturing firms in 1970, and detailed profiles of the activities of 50 of them since 1970.
Time paths of profit rates will be examined to identify the persistence of profits, and returns to R&D will be estimated.
The links between R&D investment, physical capital, learning by doing, and sustained market dominance will also be identified.
Secondary objectives of the project are to develop an appropriate framework within the linkages between financial markets and dynamic efficiency gains can properly be understood; to assess empirically the role and effectiveness of the market for corporate control in promoting dynamic efficiency gains; and to provide a stronger basis for policy in the areas of stock market regulation, competition policy, and support for innovation in relation to these long term efficiency considerations.
