I've got your form here somewhere
Right.
and erm  I, it tells me what you wanted to talk about.
Yes.
Erm  oh that's right.
You're third year English aren't you?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Okay.
And er oh you er it's social work you're interested in is it?
Yes.
Yes.
Erm  okay.
Yeah .
Can I get on a postgrad two year course next year ?
Mm.
You mean to apply now for autumn?
Yes.
I think that's very optimistic really.
Well, and what experience have you got?
Not very much.
I mean I, I, I took er a gap year out in Birmingham working for a church.
Oh I see.
Er 
And what did you actually do?
Well it was called a Discipleship Training course erm 
Yes.
so a lot of it was teaching.
Erm but the relevant 
Yeah.
bits to this would be erm I ran er a youth group in Ladywood which was er central Birmingham.
Oh yes.
And er we did a couple of weeks erm teaching in schools and we helped run a erm a lunching club for old people.
Oh yes.
But the, the, probably the relevant thing would be the youth, the youth work.
Erm 
Yes.
Y what did you do on the youth work side?
Well we  it was run from a local church but erm
Mm.
the  the fairly elderly couple which, who started 
Mm.
the work up erm
Mm.
he was ill or something or going away and erm er the church we were working for was invited to take it over.
Oh I see, yes.
And er so we were the kind of  erm the team who were there the, at the time so 
And 
a couple of us took it on.
did you sort of play table tennis with them, or what  did you do ?
Well that I mean that t to get them in yeah that's the sort of thing we started with erm playing pool and er table tennis and that.
Mm.
Erm
Mm.
and then we went up to more interactive things.
We had  I mean you couldn't do that much but it was
No.
you know a ten, fifteen minute discussion and stuff like that.
On  what sort of topics?
On r on religious topics mostly.
Oh I see, yes.
I mean we did you know stuff like erm er  what's the one I did?
Are, are Christians boring.
Erm 
 
you know  sort of thing like that.
I see .
So, so you weren't really doing anything on  their sort of personal development or their social  problems or, you know, could they get jobs or could they get work or what were the pressures on them, how 
No.
how did they  sort of cope with their relationships or anything like that?
No.
I mean th we did er 
No.
we talked informally about erm their 
Oh.
relationships and things like that cos that was 
Oh right, yeah.
the sort of thing that cropped up.
Yeah.
I mean there was nothing on a, on a formal level or anything 
No.
like that  welfare 
No.
or jobs or anything like that.
No.
So I mean it doesn't, I mean, I mean the point about social work erm  you know doing  er some experience is I think so that you actually experience the erm  sort of so the, the group dynamics of people who are in trouble and can't cope.
Mm.
And I, that's why I was wondering  er how much you did on that front really .
Yeah, I mean that  par apart from the youth  and I've done some at home as well erm 
Yeah.
the only other relevant 
Not much.
thing would be 
Yeah.
erm  er holiday  schools work.
Oh yes?
Yeah.
Which I've done since I was sixteen.
Mm.
Erm  but that was just group leader stuff really.
Erm but  no I ne I need erm to get on a voluntary placement next year probably.
I think you probably 
But 
do, yeah.
Yeah.
but erm I don't know what sort of thing wou would get me the best experience .
Well the thi one thing you could do is go and talk to  one or two admissions tutors of the social work  courses.
I mean there is one here of course.
Right, yeah.
And you could go over to  erm the Social Work Department in  and try and you know get an interview with the admissions person.
Mm.
Erm and  say you know, what sort of  idea, you know, what would you think would be good experience?
I mean I think it might be good if before you did that you could try and explore a bit on your own and, and have some idea but I mean 
Yeah, sure.
in a sense, when you've done that, er it's a good thing to check it out.
Mm.
Erm
Well I've, I've got a couple of applications on the go.
I mean I've got  erm seven, well .
 
But  there's one 
Yeah.
er  erm it was in the Church of England Newspaper of erm 
Mm.
Mm.
er there's a place in Dover which, which'll be a residential thing for a year.
Ah.
Erm 
That sounds  what, what sort of  er people have they got there?
That's, that's erm  adults with erm learning disabilities.
Oh I see, yes.
Erm or there's, there'll be  the other one er 
Mm.
I've got contacts with is 
Mm.
SHAD erm working in London with erm a placement with someone with a disability working 
Oh yes?
forty eight hours on with them and then forty eight hours off.
Oh I see.
And that's  
Now what's SHAD?
That's Single 
Erm  I can't remember what 
no.
the exact acronym is.
No.
What sort of people are there?
I mean er
Erm well there're all sorts of er range groups but
Yeah.
erm it's mostly physically handicapped people.
Oh I see.
Yes.
Erm
Well it might be good.
Erm  er is er now does that have a religious basis, SHAD, or 
SHAD doesn't, no.
No.
Erm the one in Dover does,
Does, yes.
but it's not  erm
er it was, it's welfare based rather than 
Yes, I see.
I mean I, I don't know how you feel about it but it might be a good thing  to do something that was not religious based, erm 
Yes , definitely.
y you know, just to get in with er a different sort of group of people with different sort of motivations and so on,
Yeah.
erm to show you know you have the broader erm experience.
I mean hav have you looked at our Alternative Opportunities section out there, or
Erm 
That's the yellow files.
that's the yellow files.
Yeah.
Yeah I did I did go through it.
Yeah.
I've taken a 
Yeah.
f erm a couple 
Yeah.
of addresses down.
Yeah.
But there there wasn't, mm, well there was nothing that seemed immediately er relevant I must say, but 
No.
I mean you've not looked at er a lot of the mental health stuff?
I mean er people like the Richmond Fellowship, or  did you, you didn't find them?
No.
Maybe you don't actually, don't want to do mental 
I don't 
health, or
well, I don't know.
Erm but 
Mm.
I'm not really sure what, what I'm looking for.
No.
What, do you have any idea what sort of social work  you would want to do in the end, or not really?
Erm  well, I had a look at probation which is a a different 
Oh yes?
but similar avenue I suppose,
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
erm but there, there are elements of that which come into social work, I would have thought.
Mm.
Erm  er young off w work with young offenders or something like that.
Erm
Yes.
Yes.
I mean there are broad categories you see in a sense.
I mean certainly the social services now divide up a bit.
I mean  er you know the, the, the erm  training is supposed to be a generic training so that you learn the various erm ways of coping with clients you know, and it 
Mm.
doesn't matter whether they're ninety five or  you know sixteen, there are 
Yeah.
certain sort of listening skills and er erm the, the idea that you, you've got to get erm people to look at the things maybe they don't want to look at
Mm.
but in a positive way, and those sorts of things will obviously apply whatever group you're dealing with.
But on the other hand I think the erm social work is now going  back again to a situation where it's really rather more specialized.
Mm.
Certainly I know, somebody I know who works with North Yorkshire, they seem to have divided up into the  old and the young.
Yeah.
Erm so you've either got you know the, the, the sort of  or the old people, or you've got the young people, and that reaches back down the age range into things like child abuse which is now, you know, very er much er on the agenda.
Erm  so I mean I think, you know, it might be useful, well, in some ways it would be very useful for you to have erm two sort of six month stints in rather different environments so that then you'd sort of keep your options open a bit.
Mm.
Erm if you were interested in probation then maybe you could get work in a probation hostel  er you know as, as some sort of er assistant.
Unqualified helper or something.
Right.
Erm which would give you some contact with erm, er you know people who'd er  er just come out of prison or, or you know had been serving some sort of sentence or other, you know, maybe not a custodial one or something.
Erm  but that might be interesting.
I mean I'm sure if you asked erm  you know the probation service  people in York, I'm sure they could, well I mean if you're thinking about probation, you probably ought to go in and look, unless you've already 
Yeah, sure.
done so, I mean and as part of that you could  ask questions about whether, you know there might be some longer-term  placement you could do or something.
Right.
Erm  so I mean that might be  worth it.
Would you do this erm  I suppose if you, well I don't know, it depends whether it's residential or not.
You you'd be  erm quite happy to do residential 
Yes.
would you?
Mm.
I think that's good because I think most of it probably is residential.
Mm.
Erm and of course you get  erm you know a rather more intense  sort of experience I think if you do that.
Mm.
Erm I mean it's not what everybody wants but erm I think it is quite er interesting.
I mean the, the Richmond Fellowship things are quite interesting.
They've got sort of mind you they have their own training sort of regime as well, which in some ways is, means it's quite good experience because it is  structured in, in a, in a  way to give you some training, whereas of course if you just go in to do a job then erm how much  sort of training you get varies a bit .
I mean one would hope you got some wherever you  went  you know,
Mm, sure.
er but sometimes you don't get very much.
Erm and if there is erm  a sort of definite regime then that, that may be quite good.
I mean it depends  er whether you're in a  fearful hurry to start the training  you know,t and get 
Erm 
qualified.
I mean erm 
No I don't think, no I'm not in a fearful hurry.
It's just  I've, I've done three years at university now and I, I  
Yes .
and it's, it's a subject which I've enjoyed doing a lot, English,
Right.
Yeah.
erm but it's, it's had n you know no vocational direction whatsoever,
Right.
Yeah.
and erm  er i now er now I want to  I don't mind training again but it, it's got to be vocational.
Right.
Yes.
And so  erm  the, the experience in w the work experience I get now I want to be with a, a definite view to get to, get in training 
Right.
Yes.
in order to get 
Yes.
a job.
Yes I see.
Yes, what I really meant was I'm, I  forget exactly but we could look it up in  you know the Richmond Fellowship file out there,
Mm.
and they've got quite a big place at Harrogate where you could go for a day or two to observe what was going on and so on.
Now I think, if I remember rightly, they had a sort of two year  sort of training pattern,
Right.
which you do, and then you're er you know in their eyes you're, you're sort of trained to some sort of level for their sort of work.
Now that's n not the same thing as the  the erm  study year you know, the 
Mm.
social work qualification but, erm, on the other hand  you know it's a structured sort of and therefore you get, you know, there'd be reviews and all this sort of thing, and therefore you'd get something out of it.
Erm it's just that er and I don't suppose you need to stay two years if you don't want to.
I mean if it was working  well then maybe you'd stay an extra year and  sort of finish it off but 
Mm.
erm if, if you know you, you felt you wanted to go off and do th start the professional social work training well that would probably be alright.
Erm I think too of course the thing about probation to go back to that,
Mm.
is that you have to be accepted by the Home Office as well as the erm you know particular institution running the course.
I d I don't mean that's er er a terribly difficult thing but it is just that that does have to happen.
Right.
Er that
Erm .
whe what sort of thing are you talking about?
I about past criminal offences and stuff?
Oh no.
No I think it's, well I mean yes presumably.
I mean I 
Well 
don't think they like 
Well I haven't got, well I got stopped 
No no.
for not having my lights 
Yes.
on my bike once but er  
Well  no I don't I don't think that's too serious .
No it, it wasn't really that,i it was erm although I'm sure they do  check that.
Mm.
But, well I think they check that sort of thing for social workers don't they?
Yeah they do, yeah I read that yeah.
Cos they  have to be very careful, especially with this abuse 
Mm.
business you see that, er anyway, erm  no, I think it's more that the Home Office want to be satisfied that you're the sort of person who will make a good probation officer.
Right.
Erm pardon?
Right.
W er yeah, yeah.
I mean er they don't  I, I think it's more like an interview you know  er really, where they w they will be trying to assess your suitability as well as the actual institution that's going to give you the course.
Right.
So you've got two of these sort of sessions er er to go through, that's really the only point.
Right.
Erm and  I mean I'm not too sure, you'd probably need to ask the probation people, what specific things they were looking for, but I suppose the probation service, I mean you are an officer of the court,
Mm.
erm which means there is a sort of er disciplinary er sort of element in it.
I mean I suppose there is in all social work in a sense, that if you go in to look at a family and, and you're trying to assess  you know whether the children should be taken into care, well you're exercising a  a sort of statutory erm  er sort of responsibility, and as far as the clients are concerned, er if you, like that can sort of get in the way of er  er a more human sort of relationship if you see what I mean, because
Mm.
you know, in the one case you're, you're the representative of court the probation  erm officer and they know that if they break the probation or you sort of erm do a bad report on them, maybe they've got a suspended or something and they'll, so you know there's a, and, and you somehow have to handle that
Mm.
so that it doesn't alienate the person  and, and, and they regard you as a, you know and that's actually probably quite tricky, except of course that you can't just let them off, because you  are actually  an officer of the court.
Mm.
You see what I mean?
And er probably they'd be interested to know how you would sort of handle that.
Right.
Erm and er the, I suspect, I mean there are probably as many answers to that as there are  probation officers .
Er but it's a particular problem for probation, you know?
Mm.
Erm  and the, the social work thing has also something of that.
You know, if the erm  that if the family think you're going to actually take the child off them because they're not looking after it properly, then I mean obviously they're not perhaps going to be as frank with you as they might otherwise.
Mm.
And you know that may hamper you in really reaching a decision about  erm  the real nature of the relationship they've got with the child.
So you know there are some quite interesting  sort of angles
Mm.
erm  mm.
But basically I think most courses now, not sure there's actually a legal requirement, I don't think it is, but most of them want a at least a year's sort of full time  experience in erm, you know,d dealing with underprivileged people really and their problems and people who can't cope for one reason or another, and how  er y you can er er sort of help them and what sort of relationship you can build with them and so on, and how 
Mm.
you feel about it and all that.
And then you can talk about all that in the interview, about your motivation as to why you want to do the  job you see?
Mm.
And, and probably you pick up some of the language used to describe this, you know.
Yeah.
But erm 
mm.
er York apparently ask for two years' experience in 
Do they?
the postgrad course.
Oh do they?
Yeah well you could go and talk to them and see what they  what they thought you ought to be doing in that two years.
Mm.
I mean erm  well I don't know, would you want to stay here, or er
Erm  I don't know.
I mean is it  I shouldn't think so.
If I, if I was t two 
Mm.
years  erm 
Yeah.
training in between 
As well as two years' placement or something.
Yeah.
I mean I've, I've very 
Mm.
much enjoyed my three years here but 
Yeah,.
I think it would be nice to go somewhere new.
Mm.
Mm.
 
Mm.
Erm
I think one of the things is of course to try and use the placement to sort of check out for yourself erm perhaps what sort of group you want to be working with in 
Mm.
in general terms, you know.
I mean one of the problems with probation I think to a certain extent is that  er obviously if you get these people who keep going into prison and coming out again, er it's really pretty difficult to erm  er  influence their behaviour positively probably.
Mm.
And that can be a bit depressing, I think.
Erm  whereas you know maybe with the younger people you feel, well at least there's  you know more, more chance.
Erm
I think you feel that you've put in more a more positive input .
Yes.
What if y well that's right, yes.
Yes you know there is a chance still to er get them on a  er a route which will give them a sort of positive  er relationship to society maybe rather than a negative one.
Mm.
But on the other hand of course you've often got to deal with not just them, but their parents or, or people around them or the people they relate to and 
Mm.
you know er e so even, even that can be  quite difficult, but on the other hand  you know there's probably more, more chance of  creating something positive.
Mm.
But I mean it depends.
I mean some people actually  erm  depends what you think of as positive.
I mean I, you know some people actually  erm  quite like looking after the older people, where
Mm.
really I mean what you're almost sort of presiding over is a sort of steady decline, really, but on the other hand I think some people think if you can make that as erm as sort of dignified as you can and actually give them  sort of support when they actually need it,
Mm.
then erm that's actually quite a worthwhile, you know some people get quite a lot of satisfaction from doing that.
Yeah.
So it's a very personal  sort of thing really, you know which area you  want to go into.
And I suppose  it's not necessarily always the one that you've had experience in so far, you know.
Yeah.
That's true.
But I mean the, the
Mm.
I suppose  the, the sort of things that made me think I might be suitable for social work have been coming from working  with the young.
Right, yes.
Yes.
Erm but you see I haven't  I don't know.
I suppose in interview, especially with er a C V like mine, that I might come over as quite  erm  naive 
Yes.
and I, I ha I've had a privileged background.
You know even 
Mm.
the very fact that I'm sitting at university,
Yes .
would denote that.
Erm  but I  I want to  and I'm not sure where to go from here, I'm not sure
No.
where to get the contact that I would need.
Erm 
Well it may, it may be that  
 
you, you will  it'll be a sort of growing thing, you know?
Mm.
What whatever you start with, that'll, that'll give you another  erm  er sort of experience.
I mean I think that's why in way it, it would be good to go outside the religious context, because then you'll come up er y you er you know you'll meet people who have a er a rather different motivation
Yeah.
to your own, but you'll be, you'll understand it, you know, and you'll, you'll  erm er get to understand what, what their motivation is, which 
Mm.
I think'll be very important because
Mm.
probably er the majority of your colleagues are not going to be religious.
Yeah.
I mean unless you actually do go and work for a specifically religious  charity,
Mm.
which of course you, you might be able to do.
Mm.
But erm that would er  y you know limit you er very much, and even if you did, er you would almost certainly be, be erm  having to relate to other professionals in, in, in the er area who, who were not  religious, so it would be a very good thing to 
Mm.
do that I think and, and see another  side.
And I mean in that way you might sort of really want to go and look at one of these erm  er  sort of  er rather awful inner city areas.
But I suppose Birmingham is not  er er 
marvellous  is it really  from that point of view.
That's right.
Er where I was working erm in the 
Yeah.
last er half of that year
Mm.
erm w in Ladywood erm er 
Mm.
Oh right.
erm the people who came to the youth group they 
Yeah.
erm they were erm  underprivileged.
Yes.
I mean the schools they went to weren't  er weren't really what I was used to  you know .
No .
Yes.
Yes.
Erm  but to be honest I, I think you're right about the Christian angle because I do think that erm, although I enjoyed that year,
Yeah.
erm if 
Yeah.
if I had er if I could do it again I'd do something  erm really different from that,
Yes.
erm a lot 
Yes.
more practically-minded than it was.
Right, yes.
Yes 
Erm because it was a, a sort of a student thing as well,
Mm.
and there was, there 
Mm.
were, there was bible teaching and all sorts but  I don't know.
I don't 
Mm.
Mm.
I, I should think you're right, I would get 
Yes.
er boxed in.
Well I, I think it would you know you th there there's, there's  I mean that's not to er deny the importance of erm er you know Christian motivation,
No sure, mm.
it's ju it's just to get a look at the other side so that you can see that erm 
Mm.
and erm  I think too you, if, if you can think perhaps  for yourself, try and think out what you want to get out of this experience.
You know what you want to get out of it,
Mm.
er in terms of equipping yourself for erm er you know being er erm  er  well better able I suppose to, to work out  where you could make er a, a, a, a real contribution you know?
Mm.
Mm.
Now what do you need to  know , you know, about yourself or about how you relate to particular groups of, of underprivileged erm or  er you know inadequate people, I mean people who can't cope in various ways,particular erm areas, I mean age groups or particular forms of erm  er maybe disability er or handicap or whatever,
Mm.
which you know maybe you, you, you'd like to  erm  sort of er see how you related to those sort of people.
Mm.
Erm  er it's a huge area of course.
Yeah.
Erm and, and I think in a way you y you know you may start the exploration and then that may lead you on to do something else, and, and you may spend  actually a bit of time before you actually want to start the training.
Sure.
You know before you're sure whether it's  cos you know if you get into probation you see, that's quite a specialized  area and, and it may I think actually it might be  it's quite difficult to get into.
Mm.
Erm  er so er you know it may be that you would need to work, and I'm sure they would probably expect you to have worked with offenders erm 
Mm.
or ex-offenders or something in some  category o or other, or er perhaps amongst young erm you know underprivileged groups who  provide a lot of the erm juvenile criminals.
Mm.
You know so that you are trying to do that.
Er and also it's not always easy, I mean  there's all this youth work business and sort of detached youth work and so on in  erm  er you know in the very underprivileged areas, but actually I, I think people say that the erm  er the disaffected teenagers are actually some of the most difficult people to relate to at all.
I mean some people have a knack.
Mm.
You know.
But, but they really are quite  quite difficult you know, and almost you want your sort of most skilled  people   er doing that really erm 
Mm.
and er it's sort of a question of erm  how much challenge you want to undertake both during the placement period and immediately afterwards.
But that's one of the strengths I suppose of the social work qualification, that it is a generic one so 
Mm.
you can move about afterwards 
Mm.
and so on.
But 
And the, and the training 
Mm.
er I mean er especially 
Yeah.
er with it changing, I mean that's er it's very much 
Yeah.
placement based isn't it?
Oh yeah.
But you see the thing 
Yeah.
er  that would be  erm  structured in a way that y the people who are er training are making sure you've got the best out of it and are making 
Mm.
sure you were 
Oh yes.
erm examining what you 
Yeah.
were learning as you went along,
Yes .
Yeah.
and erm 
Yeah.
you know that's exactly what I want.
Mm.
But I need 
Mm.
this experience to get on the course
Mm.
and I need to ensure that this experience erm  well I  I need to make sure that I will be evaluating it in a similar way as I went along.
Yes.
I think that's right.
I think if you can  now, it may be that you could find a sort of semi-structured thing like the Richmond Fellowship.
Now I've no   brief for the Richmond Fellowship 
you know,
No.
j it just happens to be one that I know about.
Mm.
There may be lots of others which do very similar things, but I think this is a question of you working out the criteria for your placement that you want, you know,
Mm.
and, and what you're trying to do and what you hope to get out of it,
Mm.
erm and er then you know you'll, you'll have a bit more of a, a shopping list  as it were, and, and that may help you to erm actually define where you want to go within this huge range of  of er you know possibilities.
Mm.
Erm  I mean  there are erm  it's very interesting.
Cos there's also another th area I know a bit about is, and, and don't take  these as  being the only areas, it's just it's easier if you actually discuss a  a sort of case, you know?
Mm.
Erm  there's this erm  Rudolf Steiner community which is part of the Camp Hill Village Trust.
They actually set up villages, which are in erm  you know usually in rural er surroundings, and erm er they have erm  usually I mean they're mentally-disabled people there, and erm er they set up the village so that there are able- bodied people in there, and yet they live with the er mentally disabled people, you know they have houses and they the erm in inverted commas normal people have  erm   children and all this sort of thing, erm and yet they have erm er  some of these mentally defective people living with them in the house,
Mm.
and they have to you know  let their children get used to them and so on and 
Mm.
erm er  it's very interesting because of course the children grow up  probably much more comfortable around people who've got mental problems than you or I  would be 
Mm.
because they, they just know they're different and they, they learn a way of coping, you know?
And now that's a very interesting thing to see,I mean 
Mm.
erm now those sort of villages, there's one at  Botton Village near Danby, which is out near Scarborough.
And you could go to that for a weekend if 
Mm.
you wanted to, to see what was going on.
And I'm sure you could have great discussions with the people there and so on about all sorts of things.
I mean, I mean there are er there are, I mean they probably  I think a lot of them probably are not social work qualified.
Mm.
Now I don't know what training they've had actually.
Erm I mean maybe they haven't had very much,but erm  but in, in a sense there's a sort of huge commitment on their part to that, because they actually, I remember some chap came over to do the talk and  I think he's got four kids and he said, well you know, I didn't know how my kids were going to react to people  fine you know  
Mm.
.
I mean you have to watch things a bit, but you know basically it's a good experience for them.
And erm  he said, I've got no  erm  pension or anything, you know I, cos they don't, they pool the money you see, they, and I mean they do things like erm oh I don't know have cows and make cheese and ice 
Mm.
cream and grow potatoes and all this and probably they have bees and sell honey and you know they eat er they really try to be self- sufficient  sort of community as much as they can.
Obviously some things they probably have to buy, shoes and 
Mm.
Mm.
that sort of thing, so they make some things and sell them.
Erm and er but he's worked at that you see, but he doesn't get any money for it I don't think.
I don't know what they do about  must have some sort of spending money, but 
Mm.
you know it doesn't  they  they don't erm  sort of exist in the social security system like the rest of us do,
Mm.
and therefore that community's going to have to look after him when he's old.
And of course I don't know how long  don't know how long that one's been going for, but obviously that's another  sort of problem in some way.
Mm.
But I mean there are huge ways of er you know very very different ways of giving service really.
Mm.
And you might find out some  sort of interesting things about that.
Er the social work qualifat qualification's a good one because it, it  is a sort of base for all sorts of things, and, and you know you might learn specialist erm  I don't know, sort of psychothera therapy techniques of various sorts, but probably the social work qualification would be a good starting point to  to build from.
Mm.
You know, so erm  
good starting point  the  social work qualification .
Okay.
Okay, well you know.
Yeah.
Mm.
And then you see where it goes on  from there.
Mm.
But what if 
Yes?
if erm 
 
well where do I go from here really?
I mean if I want 
Well I th I think you, you, I, I would erm  er go and, and have another look at this alternative   thing.
The .
And obviously there are some of them which relate locally to organizations which are national
Mm.
and you could go and look at the local one and talk to the people there and see what they're doing and
Yeah.
all this sort of thing.
Erm  and I'd try and go and see the admissions person on the  C Q S W here,
Right.
erm and ask them you know and say, and if they want two years, say well you know I'm pretty keen on this, now what, you know I   necessarily expect you to have me 
when I come back and apply  but I mean 
 
you know what sort of things do you think I should be doing?
And try and tell them briefly what you've done in that  sort of area you know, and, and see wh see what they say.
And erm maybe have a look through erm some of the erm well there's a file on  social work isn't there and all the stuff about the qualifications, and get some of the prospectuses and so and
Mm.
erm  maybe go and see one or two others if you can get to see them.
Erm and er  you also try, so, so really it's a question of developing your own ideas about what you think  you want to explore and the sort of skills and things that you want to try and develop,
Mm.
erm and also checking with them that you know you're not  going one way and no no , they'd want you to do something else,
Mm.
erm and, and trying to er  er both satisfy yourself and them  that, that you know you're getting the right sort of experience.
Yeah.
Okay.
Mm.
And er, yeah.
I suppose I wanna be a bit careful that  the experience I get isn't too specialist as well.
Well, erm  
Do you think that matters or not?
Mm.
I think a lot of it is about  erm  how these er  people, you know how really a lot of the problems for people are in their relationships with the people around them,
Right.
and, and if those are bad or not supportive enough or actually destructive,
Mm.
then n you know they can't cope with it.
And, and, and it's getting the idea of how that works  is very important.
Now you, you can do that in all sorts of ways.
Mm.
Erm and er I think, I think that's one of the most important things.
And also how erm if you are a, a helper  what sort of pressures that puts on you.
You know, what sort of emotional stuff they try and dump on you,
Mm.
and, and what do you do about it, you know whe when they er y you know, I mean, I mean I think one of the things is you, you can start off erm you know very open and so on, but if you're not careful y y you actually take on responsibility for them  you know in a, in a way which is actually not helpful to them and is probably very bad  for you 
Mm.
because you've just taken on too much.
And you, but you, of course you have to take on something.
There's only  if the   person you're talking to thinks you don't care, well I mean they're not you know  they're not going to think very much of you are they?
Mm.
But, but if, if they discover that  you know they can really get you erm er to er do all their worrying for them,
Mm.
er then maybe they will try and do that.
And that's not very good, you know.
I mean your own aim is really to make yourself superfluous in the end.
I mean you may have to support them through a  sort of bad patch, but the idea is to erm get them so that they can look after themselves, you know.
And they don't really want to go on using you as a  a sort of prop, because I mean you can't afford that because you've got lots of other clients and you, you know really the aim is to try and get them back to  self-sufficiency.
Mm.
But  there is a lot of er sort of emotional interaction going on, and you'll have to get used to that.
And I mean part of the point of doing the training of course is to get the hang of how to handle that.
Yeah, sure.
Erm 
But, yeah and then, but er in the context of the training,
Right, yes.
I'll be given structures in which to evaluate that and people will be continuously assessing me I suppose .
Oh yes, and seeing whether you'd  yes, how you were coping with it and whether you got too involved or whether you didn't get involved enough or whether you actually were able to sort of get this balance between erm  the sort of emotional support you give and the actual practical help which maybe they need in some sort of way, you know because I mean 
Mm.
I mean  erm and sometimes of course you can't give them  the practical help they need, you know,
Mm.
because there isn't a grant or there isn't whatever it is and  you know and, and how you actually manage to  er cope with that yourself.
Because you know you don't have unlimited  resources.
In any helping profession you've usually got this problem, you haven't got enough resources.
Mm.
You know.
Er I mean you obviously have to make erm  decisions about that and so on.
And the nature of caring is changing to the caring professions.
I mean now, the erm  the social workers erm are care managers in a lot of cases, in other words it may be contracted out to somebody else to do the actual caring and you look at the package which the client is getting,you know it might be I dunno some old dear who needs  meals on wheels and visits every  week or something  
Mm.
and maybe it isn't you that do the visit, it's somebody else who's, who's being paid to do it, but you may be responsible for exercising professional judgment about whether that's the appropriate thing that should be happening and perhaps assessing whether they're doing it properly.
Mm.
Now that's a comparatively new development but, but, but it's, it's coming in now.
Erm 
Mm.
but I think you're right, I think if you, you can get qualified that's the thing and then you can begin to look  thereafter.
Except that you do need to have an idea of  I think which area cos that will determine your placements and things you see.
Yeah.
Well I mean all, all I know in that at the moment is that I, I'd I would be  most naturally drawn to youth, I would have thought.
Okay, well I should start there  you know, erm  and, and er see what options there are for getting involved with erm  you know young people, erm 
Mm.
and  but they are the toughest, that's the only other thing I think.
Yeah.
Except it may be easier for you cos you're nearer in age you see.
But that, that causes its own problems because erm, you know, do you just become one of them or what do you do, and 
Mm.
erm ho well anyway,anyway.
Er but if that's what you're drawn to I should start there,
Mm.
and, and, and see, but try and see what sort of various experiences there are.
Of course there's also you can use one of the agencies like Community Service Volunteers  to 
Mm.
try and get a placement.
You know they're a  erm placements  agency basically.
I mean they don't charge you anything, and er I don't think they charge the employers anything, but their raison d'etre is to get volunteers into appropriate places.
Oh that sounds .
Erm  but even although that's their raison d'etre they've also only got so many places, so many 
Sure.
volunteers and they try and match them, so 
Right.
the clearer you are about what you want  er the better, you know, the more likely you are to get  w er you know what's appropriate for you really.
Mm.
So I think you probably need to sit down and try and think out some  criteria for yourself about what you want.
Mm.
 
Yeah.
I mean  I'm sure you're right, but I just, I just don't know with the information I've got how to make those sort of decisions.
Is it a case 
 
of wading through files, or
Well erm  er yes.
can you only get those sort of erm those sort of 
 
ideas through the er placements themselves?
I mean I  
Yes, I see what you mean .
Well to a certain extent I suppose it's true, erm but I suppose if you said, well  erm you know, can I think of skills that I need to develop?
Erm  and er if I can, what are they?
And erm er what er you know how, how might  that be, be developed, you know.
And what opportunities would I have for that in these various  er situations?
You know.
Mm.
I mean I think there is a danger  quite a number of the C erm Community Service Volunteer placements involve things like looking after very severely handicapped people who are erm in higher education or something.
Mm.
I mean really severely handicapped so they really need sort of helpers with them for  you know at least fifty percent of the day or something.
Mm.
Well now I'm not sure that that's actually a very useful  sort of thing to do.
Mm.
I mean, I mean I'm sure it's useful in the sense that it gets one person through er doing a degree who couldn't have done it otherwise, but whether it would actually give you the sort of  experience you want, I'm much more doubtful.
Mm.
And maybe you would know about that.
Erm  y I mean if you read er or somebody suggested that to you you might 
Mm.
Mm.
have a view about that.
Mm.
But I think if y if you read some of the stuff and you said well, could I do that?
Would that be what I wanted to do?
And then you thought well no, no it wouldn't because, and why wouldn't it, er but on the other hand there might be some good things about it and what were they,
Mm.
and sort of write them down, you know.
Er I mean I don't think you want to spend hours and hours and hours doing it, but  but, but 
Well I can't, I've got a degree to get .
Yeah.
Well you know, if you spent an afternoon looking through some of the files and what the opportunities were.
Mm.
Er and I think also it should be helpful to go to er a tutor, an, an, an admissions tutor and say well you know, what, what sort of skills  do I need to get?
What are you actually looking for?
I'll certainly get that fixed up .
Yeah.
Mm.
And if, if you get  stuck with it, well come back and we'll have another  discussion, you know.
Okay.
I th I think  the, the most suitable placement I've found was that one in Dover but there, there, then there's the  the erm the Christian motivation .
Yes.
I mean I wouldn't want to labour that too much.
Mm.
Er what was it there?
You
It was er it's a residential place for 
Yeah.
erm adults with learning disability.
I mean it  you know that would give you the sort working in a team and working with people and  erm 
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
I dunno.
It depends though.
If you want to work with young people,
Yeah that's true, yeah.
maybe you should try, you know, and it may not be possible to get the  absolutely perfect answer either .
Mm.
Erm but I mean on the other hand if you start trying to develop your  criteria, and I'd go out and  look at  Botton Village and look at  the Richmond Fellowship or something,
Mm.
and you know talk to people who do it and so on.
Now  say, there's a social work contact we've got in York, who's
I've read that, yeah.
Well go and talk to them about it,
Mm.
and try and find out what they want and what's happening to the social services and y you know what they think about  er what they'd, what skills they'd like you to have and the sort of experience you need and so on.
I think the more people you talk about it to about it the better, especially people who are in it,
Mm.
or doing the selecting for courses or for jobs and so on.
So maybe if you had a chat to the admissions person and a chat to the social work contact we've got in York,
Mm.
and try and get out of them what skills, you know, and chuck in a few ideas of your own, you know,
Yeah .
maybe that would, that would be good.
Okay.
Does that sound alright?
Yeah, that's very helpful.
Good.
 
Okay, erm  fine.
Well I should think that's probably about it then.
Right.
Erm
Is there anything else?
Erm
Er I'll make er other appointment, another appointment as and when I .
Yeah, that would be fine.
You know, I mean we're here, well are you going down   at the end of the week or something?
Or
Erm no, I've got too much 
Yeah.
, I'm gonna stay here through Easter.
Oh right.
Well we're, we're here except for Easter.
Well you've probably seen, we've put a notice up on the front door to say when we're open and when we're shut over  
 
the Easter vac, you know, but it's really basically a week we have at Easter and 
Mm.
sometimes there are odd days  in the vac when we do other things and we shut, you 
Mm.
know, but erm 
Yeah.
And you can always catch me, if making an interview is difficult in the time
Mm.
then you can catch me or one of the other careers advisors out 
Mm.
in the Information two till four every day.
Mm.
Erm during term that is, unfortunately  
Right.
Well of course I, I should have done all this last year, you know .
Yeah.
Oh well.
Never mind.
It's, at least you're doing it now, and 
Yeah.
erm  getting it right's important.
Mm.
But I think you do need to plan a bit, you know in spite of the fact you've got the degree to do, if, if you can spend time going to see these people.
You know, you don't need to spend  ages doing it, but, but just take a bit of time to do it and 
Mm.
to have a look at the opportunities in the files, thinking about what you actually  might want to do and, and so on and what's on offer.
Mm.
Right.
Okay?
Right er, thanks a lot.
Right.
Jolly good.
Oh, now  I've got to stop this thing haven't I?
Oh  ?
Er what happens er  I stop  .
