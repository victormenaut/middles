Dear 
PROPOSED SPORTS CENTRE — DRUM BRAE PARK
Thank you for your letter of 20 July 1993 on behalf of about the above proposal.
representations, in the copy of his letter to the District Council's Director of Planning, are primarily concerned with planning matters, and that officer will no doubt be responding accordingly.
The development is being promoted by the City of Edinburgh District Council, although it has not yet progressed to the submission of a planning application on which I have been asked for comments by the District Councils Director of Planning.
It is understood to be of a similar size to the centre at Ainslie Park, with little use, if any, for special functions, and with provision of a library.
Further information has been requested about the traffic using the Ainslie Park Centre as a guide for this proposal.
There would also be some housing accessed from Parkgrove Crescent and Loan.
This Department has been asked, by the relevant District Council Department, about access to development on the west side of Drum Brae Park.
Because of the limited visibility at the top of the hill a new access directly from Drum Brae Park on to Drum Brae could not be recommended.
The requirements which would be entailed by a access onto Drum Brae Terrace as an alternative have been discussed and would require to be assessed in relation to the likely traffic movements.
Similar consideration would be given to the housing proposal.
The housing proposals will generate some additional traffic but not on a scale which would cause capacity or safety problems.
comments with regard to the recreational traffic density accord with other information on recreational traffic.
I regret that it is not possible to provide any further information on this matter at present, and hope that this information will be of assistance to you.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir/Madam
In accordance with the terms of the Local Authorities Traffic Orders (Procedures)(Scotland) Regulations 1987, I write to advise you that Lothian Regional Council propose to promote a right turn prohibition Order from the A71 into the B7031 for both A71/B7031 junctions.
Details are shown on the attached plan Drawing No HY7/1106/54.
The previous proposal to prohibit vehicles using the southern junction has been discontinued.
Formal objections are not invited at this consultation stage as a further period will be allowed for the submission of objections when the proposals are formally advertised.
I should welcome any comments you may have to offer within 3 weeks of the date of this letter.
Yours faithfully
Dear ,
Homelessness
Thank you for your letter dated  20/07/93 
The Social Work Department's involvement with homelessness lies in relation to Community Care legislation.
We are jointly involved in assessing needs.
These are usually longer term support needs due to the vulnerabilities of being homeless.
Vulnerabilities such as youth, learning difficulties and mental health problems.
The Department does not offer a direct service to homeless people nor do we publish any leaflets about this issue.
For information more relevant to your questions, I would suggest that you contact:
* Stopover
(An emergency hostel for 16 — 21 year olds), 9 Mayfield Gardens, Newington, Edinburgh EH9 2AX
* The Housing Department
, 23/25 Waterloo Place, Edinburgh EHI 3BH
*Shelter Scottish Campaign for the Homeless
, 65 Cockburn Street, Edinburgh EH1 1BU
Another useful contact would be  who is one of two social workers based at an Edinburgh District Council run hostel.
He is involved with carrying out community care assessments.
You can contact him at the Randolph Crescent Hostel, Edinburgh or on .
The best of luck with your research.
Yours sincerely
Dear ,
I write to confirm a recent telephone conversation.
A group of Japanese academics are  visiting the Social Work Department, on Saturday, September 18th.
This  visiting party comprises of individuals who work in the Health Sector and have a particular interest in Community Care.
An afternoon visit to the Seagrove Centre, has been agreed upon with yourself.
As yet  we do not have details on exact numbers, but when I do get more information, I will be back in touch.
Until then this arrangement is provisional.
Thank you for your assistance.
Dear 
Thank you for your enquiry yesterday regarding a representative from the Social Work Department being present at the Tenants' Association meeting on Monday 30 August 1993 at St John Vianney School.
I have passed the information on to who is the District Manager at the South East Edinburgh District  and he will contact you direct to let you know whether or not a representative will be present.
I hope you will receive an early response.
Dear 
Thank you for your letter of 9 August which I have shown to  and  who will, in future, try to provide more information on the layout of each article.
I hope this will cut down on the time your typesetter has to spend on the job and, therefore, on the final cost.
With regard to your claim that you did not have enough information on which to base an accurate estimate, I shall copy your letter to  at the Central Purchasing Unit for her advice as to how we should proceed.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
I am returning  your invoice because I do not have an order form to set it against.
My understanding was that you were working for  and that you would send your invoice to him.
He will then bill us for half the cost as agreed.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
I have now had the opportunity to look over the attached and also asked a colleague to do a quick proof-read.
You no doubt have picked up on the typos etc. but it is sometimes useful to have another ‘eye’.
I therefore enclose a copy of the text of the HIV/AIDS Readyguide with some minor amendments marked.
I hope that this is useful.
I trust that you have now received a list of the Social Work Centres and also that you had a profitable meeting with  regarding the design of the front cover.
Reading over the text, I suddenly wondered if you required a sentence or two to introduce the section on Social Work Centres.
I do not have a copy of the previous Readyguide to hand and cannot remember how we introduced this.
Should you wish an introduction, perhaps you could contact  next week.
You have certainly done an excellent job and I hope that at our next meeting on 11 August 1993 at 10.00 a.m.
(Room 413, Shrubhill House), we will be in a position to agree the final copy ready for print.
As you know, I am away on leave as of this Friday but   will be pleased to assist if you have any queries and  will also be back from leave.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
I am writing in reply to your letter of 30 June 1993 to our Director enclosing copies of leaflets you have recently produced.
We found these very interesting and should be glad to see copies of the material you mentioned as about to go to print.
As I am new to this post I am not sure whether we sent you copies of new Community Care leaflets when they were first produced so I now enclose a set for your information.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
and  are both on holiday at the moment so I am writing in their absence about a recent print job Req No 239886.
The section who raised this order have asked me to draw your attention to two matters.
Firstly, the order took nine weeks to complete which they feel is unacceptably long.
Secondly, the forms have not been amended in line with the samples enclosed with the order.
They are, therefore, not correct.
We are using the first two forms (No 1581 and No 1650) despite this, but the third form (No 1655) is completely unusable and we are having to reorder.
I should be grateful to have comments on these two points.
Yours sincerely

WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION SERVICES
Thank you for your letter of 21 July 1992.
I enclose an extract copy of the relevant section of the Annual Report and Accounts (1991/92) which gives information on a number of departments including the Department of Management and Information Services.
The officers in the department contribute to a wide range of reports.
I regret that I am unable to assist you with this aspect at this time.
Perhaps if you were able to identify a particular topic a relevant report could be made available to you.
You will wish to note that this department through the Personnel and Financial Services Unit provides a day to day personnel service to other central departments.

INTER-DEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNT
Thank you for your letter of 1 July 1991.
I am pleased to clarify the position.
The Inter-Departmental Account was raised as a result of expenditure incurred in respect of this Authority purchasing bulk supplies of National Joint Council Circulars.
The cost of the papers is then recovered from the various departments of the Council and the Joint Boards who participate in these arrangements.
The allocated charges to which you refer are the product of the Council's relevant expenditure less any income received.
The department of finance use this net figure for allocating purposes.
There is, of course, no obligation on the Lothian and Borders Police Board to continue to receive these circulars from the Lothian Regional Council.
However, the cost to the Board would be similar if circulars were obtained direct from COSLA.
I hope that you find this explanation helpful.
I return the account for payment in accordance with past practice.

Theatre In Education — To Buy or Not to Buy
I refer to your recent meeting and discussion with my Divisional Officer,, regarding  our proposed TIE initiative at the Traverse in June.
As requested I have gathered some material which will hopefully provide you with the necessary background information on the issues to be addressed.
My colleague,, and I have been asked to provide examples of cases and complaints.
We have discussed this at length and although we have a number of ideas we feel that if we were to air them now we would perhaps stifle your creativity and spoil the opportunity for a fresh approach.
In addition we feel that we do not have the technical or professional expertise to know whether our ideas are actually workable, given the various constraints.
We will however be happy to discuss our ideas with you on June 8th and will thereafter provide ongoing support and guidance on points of law and other assistance.
If you should require additional information I can be contacted on 469–5469.
I look forward to meeting you on the 8th.

The package is currently under development and is the result of co-operation between the Trading Standards and Education departments of Lothian Regional Council.
It will be completed and available later this year.
The materials are intended as a resource for teachers of pupils in the 10–14 age range and the package will be distributed free to all schools in Lothian.
Furthermore, it is planned to market the package, and interest in purchasing the materials is expected from educationalists across the U.K.
I feel sure you will recognise the importance of teaching children about safety and safety labelling and I trust you will grant us permission to reproduce the Kitemark for this purpose.
Could you also please advise us on the copyright position regarding the C.E. mark?

Fair Deal Exhibition, Advice Shop, South Bridge
You will undoubtedly be aware that ‘Green’ is the marketing tool of the 90's and that my department enforces the statutory measures which aim to protect consumers against misdescriptions and misleading claims by manufacturers.
Ultimately, however, it can only be through increased education that consumers can come to understand the choices available to them in a complex and ever changing market place and be able to exercise careful and considered consumption.
To this end my Consumer Education Unit has planned and organised, on behalf of the Council, a colourful and informative Fair Deal Exhibition at the Advice Shop, South Bridge.
The exhibition aims to raise awareness of the subtle advertising and marketing techniques employed to encourage and increase the purchase of a wide variety of goods.
A complimentary set of ‘green’ consumer factsheets have also been produced.
In addition my Consumer Education Unit are targeting  tomorrow's consumers with their ‘Green Detective’ project which features as one of the initiatives at the Environmental Exploratorium being hosted at Drummond High School during the festival.
The Green Detective is based on a ‘shopping experience’ in which children have to make choices about various products, based on environmental information provided.
Please find enclosed a set of factsheets and poster advertising the Fair Deal Exhibition.
I would be grateful if you would display this material at your surgery to assist with our awareness campaign.
Further copies of the consumer factsheets can be obtained from my Consumer Education Project Co-ordinator, Rena Jamieson, on 469–5469.
I look forward to seeing you at the Exhibition launch at the Advice Shop on the evening of the 13th.
Thank you for your co-operation and if I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

THE PRICES ACT 1974 — THE PRICE MARKING ORDER 1991
I refer to the requirements of the above Order which came into effect on the 1st September 1991.
I must draw to your attention that during a recent survey it was noted that you did not appear to be complying fully with the statutory requirements in that you did not show legibly the price of some goods displayed for sale, namely at your premises.
In general, the Order requires that when goods are displayed for sale, the selling price inclusive of VAT should be shown.
It can either be marked on each item or shown on a ticket or notice referring to the item and in close proximity to it.
The price must be clearly legible to a prospective purchaser and clearly identifiable as referring to the goods in question.
This requirement applies to almost all goods displayed including any displayed in a shop window or display.
The main exemption relates to items of jewellery and precious metal which are displayed in a shop window and have a price in excess of 2,500.
A failure to comply with the Order is an offence under the above Act.
At present the penalty is, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding 2,000.
A copy of the Order (Statutory Instrument 1991 No. 1382) can be purchased from H.M.S.O., Lothian Road, Edinburgh, or guidance can be obtained without charge from the Department.
Should you wish to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

MILLERHILL PLANNING APPLICATION HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
Members are aware of the above called-in planning application and of the schedule of meetings arranged to consider the matter.
I now enclose a copy of the reports on the application by the Directors of Planning and Highways.
As previously agreed, the reports are being issued this day to Members, the press and other interested parties.
Members are requested to retain the papers for their use at the appropriate Committee meetings and the Regional Council.
The schedule of meetings begins with a presentation of the proposals by the Developers, on Friday 1 November 1991 at 2.00 pm in Room 1.5 in the Regional Chambers, to which all members of the Council and appropriate officials are invited.
This presentation will be held in private; the Developers are expected to speak for about 30 minutes, after which there will be an opportunity to ask questions of them.
(Please note that it is not intended to issue an agenda or further papers for the presentation.)
Thereafter, the matter is to be considered at meetings as follows:—
1.
Special meeting of Transportation Committee on Tuesday 5 November 1991 at (2.00 pm).
2.
Special meeting of Planning and Development Committee on Friday 8 November 1991 (11.00 am).
3.
Meeting of Regional Council on 12 November 1991 (10.00 am).
The agendas for the above 3 meetings will be issued in due course, but it is not intended that the reports should be circulated again; spare copies of the reports are available for members, by telephoning me at the undernoted extension.
Yours sincerely
Dear Colleague,
You will have heard by now about the Government's proposals for the reorganisation of local government boundaries.
These proposals provide for the replacement of the present local authorities in the area.
Three new councils are proposed; The City of Edinburgh, The Lothians (West Lothian and Midlothian combined) and Berwickshire and East Lothian.
The proposals are contained in a White Paper, and as such they are still subject to changes being made to them.
Nonetheless, I have to express my disappointment with the Government's proposals.
Over the years Lothian Regional Council has proved an effective and an efficient Council, and I believe you, as an employee, have contributed greatly to making Lothian such a progressive local authority.
If the Government's White Paper intentions are translated into legislation, the new councils will be created in April 1996.
In these circumstances, the majority of staff employed by the Council will transfer to the successor authorities.
The Government intends to set up a Staff Commission to oversee this process, but details of its remit and operation are as yet unclear.
As further details become available, I will ensure that you are kept informed.
In today's world nobody can be isolated from change and uncertainty, and the challenge for us is to continue to provide excellent services in these uncertain times.
It is of the highest importance that we continue to maintain these standards, and I am confident that together we can achieve this, and maintain the best traditions of public service in Lothian.
Dear 
PLANNING APPLICATIONS, RECREATION PARK AND SUPERMARKET, PENICUIK
Thank you for your fax to the Chief Executive inviting representation at a public meeting on 30 June 1993 to discuss planning applications for a recreation park and supermarket in Penicuik.
I understand that these applications have only just been submitted to Midlothian District Council as the local planning authority and I have to advise you that it would not be appropriate for Regional Council officials to comment publicly at this stage.
The Regional Council was consulted on the previous supermarket application and may be consulted by the District Council on the present proposal, although this is not certain as I believe it is about half the size of the earlier application.
If it is consulted, the Regional Council will formulate a view on what is being proposed and will inform the District Council These views will be taken into account by the District Council in deciding the application.
The recreation park application is unlikely to have any strategic planning significance and therefore the Regional Council will not have any involvement in its consideration which will be a matter for the District Council.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
LOTHIAN REGION (PLACING IN SCHOOLS) APPEAL COMMITTEE
A meeting of the Lothian Region ( Placing in Schools) Appeal Committee has been arranged for Tuesday 27 April 1993 at 10.30 am in the Lothian Regional Chambers, Parliament Square, Edinburgh.
If your Committee wishes a representative to attend this meeting, please let me know.
The meeting will be chaired by .
Yours faithfully
Dear 
LOTHIAN REGION (PLACING IN SCHOOLS) APPEAL COMMITTEE
The Lothian Region (Placing in Schools) Appeal Committee is likely to meet on several occasions during late May and throughout June 1993, to deal with appeals against refused placing requests for admission to primary and secondary schools for the session 1993/94.
A member from the panel of parents of school age will be required to attend each of the meetings.
It would therefore be helpful to let me know of your availability at those times by completing the attached form.
It should be returned as soon as possible using, if you wish, the pre-paid envelope.
Please note that meetings will not be held on all of the dates given on the form, but I cannot say at this early stage how many will actually need to take place.
You should also note that stating your availability on a particular date will not lead to the Clerk automatically marking you down as a member of a Committee.
A phone call will always be made to confirm that you would still be willing to come to any particular meeting.
Thank you for your help in this matter, and should you have any queries about any aspects of the Appeal Committee, please do not hesitate to contact Jim Clark on 031 469 3032, or Wendy Sinnet on 031 469 3033.

Dear Secretary of State
LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION
At the meeting of the Regional Council held on 4 August 1993, the undernoted motion was approved:—
‘Council notes with grave concern the proposals for dismantling the existing two tier system of local government in Lothian, as contained in the Government's White Paper ‘Shaping the Future — The New Councils’.
Council does not believe that the Government's proposals would lead to a more effective, efficient  or accountable system of local government.
In particular, Council is dismayed that the Secretary of State, despite the overwhelming view of the Scottish people, should seek to remove Water and Drainage from democratic control.
Furthermore, Council is of the view that the proposed structure of single tier authorities is not designed to meet the long-term needs of local government but the short-term wishes of the Scottish Conservative Party.
Council believes it is essential that the Secretary of State for Scotland, as a matter of urgency, appoints an Independent Commission to examine the proposed structure.
Until such time as the Secretary of State agrees to such a Commission, the Council agrees to support the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities' call for a policy of non-co-operation between the Authority and The Scottish Office over the question of local government reorganisation.
The Council reiterates its previously expressed view that the existing system of local government in Scotland should be retained, that a convincing case for change remains to be made and that the cost, confusion and disruption involved in the proposed reorganisation is not justified.
In the meantime, the Council instructs the Chief Executive to prepare a comprehensive response to the White Paper and authorises him to incur any necessary expenditure in doing so, noting that this will be contained within the budget for local government reform.’
Yours sincerely
Dear Councillor
APPLICATIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, FAULDHOUSE, WEST LOTHIAN
The Planning and Development Committee at its meeting on 11 February 1993 decided to visit the sites of planning applications for residential developments in Fauldhouse.

Dear 
COUNCIL TAX STAFFING PROPOSALS
I refer to your letter of 10 September 1992 concerning the Council Tax staffing proposals and the report which it is proposed to submit to the Finance Committee on Wednesday 16 September 1992.
I would point out that the procedure for the avoidance of industrial disputes is inappropriate in these circumstances.
There is a separate consultative procedure for the conduct of Management Services reviews which is more appropriate to the Council Tax staffing proposals now being considered.
The consultative procedures for the conduct of Management Services reviews has been carried out, you will be aware that there have been several consultative meetings between ourselves concerning this matter.
Nevertheless I consider it essential that we try and reach an agreement or at least an understanding before the report is considered by the Finance Committee.
I therefore propose to hold a further consultation meeting with yourself, together with Shop Steward representatives from the Community Charge Registration Office and from the Exchequer Division of the Finance Department.
I would propose to hold this further meeting at 11.30 am on Monday 14 September 1992 in the Finance Department meeting room, second floor, Chesser House.
I am copying this letter to Shop Stewards within the Community Charge Registration Office and Exchequer Division in order that they can make appropriate arrangements to be represented with yourself.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
COUNCIL TAX PUBLICITY
The Scottish Office will shortly be issuing Council Tax publicity packs to every household within the Region.
I have just placed a report before the Region's Finance Committee updating them on Council Tax issues and I enclose a copy of this report herewith for your information.
You will note in the report that I am proposing to hold a ‘Council Tax Teach-in’ for Regional Councillors in late September/early October.
I am prepared to hold a similar ‘Teach-in’ for your District Councillors if they would like to avail themselves of this.
If your Councillors would like to avail themselves of this please contact either myself or in my absence Mr A Stein (469 5001) or Mr M Peterson (469 5006) to arrange a suitable date and to finalise details.
I am also preparing introductory notes on Council Tax for my staff, as soon as these are available I will send you a copy for your information.
Yours sincerely
Dear Mr 
COUNCIL TAX
I refer to your letters of 8 June and 12 August 1992 and regret the delay in replying.
I would agree with the suggestion in your letter of 8 June that it would be good working practice for your association to collect Council Tax from  your tenants in the same way as you collected rates in the past.
Unfortunately the legislation governing Council Tax is almost the same as that for collecting Community Charge in that it does not allow Council Tax to be collected along with rent.
The Government sees that it is more accountable for the individual tenants to pay their Council Tax directly to the local authority rather than to the landlord and unfortunately no agency arrangements can be put in place that would allow this.
Yours sincerely
Dear Councillor
COUNCIL TAX
As you are aware Council Tax comes into effect from 1 April 1993 and Regional Authorities in Scotland will shortly be issuing enquiry forms to all households within their area to determine who will be liable for the tax and to enquire whether they are entitled to any discounts, exemptions or rebates.
It is anticipated that Lothian Region will be issuing forms in early December to collect all the necessary data to enable correct bills to be issued in April 1993.
It is the intention of the Scottish Office to deliver to every household in Scotland a booklet explaining the new tax.
This is likely to commence in the third week of September.
In the meantime I enclose herewith a small supply of a leaflet prepared by the Finance Department which may enable you to answer questions which will inevitably arise at your surgeries.
I will shortly be preparing more detailed notes and will make them available to you as soon as they are completed.
If you require additional information or have any queries relative to Council Tax please do not hesitate to contact either Alex Stein, Assistant Director of Finance, on extension 5002 or Mike Peterson, Rates and Collection Manager, on extension 5006.
Yours faithfully
Dear 
I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 5 February 1993 to Mr Chynoweth, Director of Finance, seeking a contribution towards your costs for preparing for Council Tax.
My senior staff have already addressed a meeting of Citizens Advice representatives in Edinburgh and explained to them the Council Tax legislation.
In addition copies of the Council's training notes ‘Lothian Regional — an Introduction to Council Tax’ have been made available to your advisers and further copies can be made available free of charge if you would like to take advantage of this.
In addition I understand you have received copies of the Scottish Office leaflets on Council Tax which have been prepared in conjunction with Local Government Officers and also the Council Tax Benefit leaflet produced by the Benefits Agency.
In view of the support and assistance which we have already provided I am not prepared to contribute towards your internal training arrangements or the preparation of the 2 self-study units you are proposing.
I am extremely grateful for the assistance your staff have provided through CAB offices in assisting individuals in connection with Community Charge and trust that this will continue into the Council Tax era following 1 April 1993.
If you would like further copies of the Region's Council Tax notes I can make these readily available and I would also be prepared to comment on any draft training document you produce.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
COUNCIL TAX — WATER CHARGES
I refer to your letter of 30 April 1993 concerning Council Tax water charges and the calculation of Council Tax rebate.
I confirm that the discounts for single person households, that is 25%, is a discount on the total charge including the water element.
In calculating Council Tax rebate however, the water charge is excluded.
Rebate is only granted on the Council Tax itself and not on the Council water charge which is a separate liability.
This does mean that Council Tax payers will have to meet the full cost of any Council water charge, less any single person discounts which may be applicable, without the benefit of rebate assistance.
The Council water charges are set by the Regional Council each year in order to cover the costs of providing a water service to domestic consumers, in this regard separate accounts must be maintained by the Council in respect of water costs and income from the Council water charges.
I trust that the above clears up any confusion on this matter, however should you have any further enquiries please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
SERVICE 101: EDINBURGH — WEST LINTON — BIGGAR
Thank you for your letter dated 27 October 1992 concerning the replacement of Sunday journeys withdrawn from the SMT service 101.
I note that you sought tenders for two options, a service between Biggar and Edinburgh via Penicuik and a service between Biggar and Penicuik only.
Although the Biggar to Edinburgh option involves a higher contract price you feel that the cost difference is justified by the benefits of a direct link to Edinburgh.
However in apportioning the cost Lothian Regional Council's share is based on our desire to only contribute to the operation of buses between the regional boundary and Penicuik.
We agree with the apportionment of distance operated within our Region, resulting in 30% of bus-miles between Biggar and Penicuik being operated within Lothian.
On this basis our share of the total annual cost will be 30% of £2,995.20, that is £898.56 per annum.
I confirm that this arrangement is acceptable to ourselves.
Yours faithfully
Dear Madam
NEWHAILES INDUSTRIAL ESTATE, MUSSELBURGH
Thank you for your telephone enquiry about the above site.
The Regional Council has just completed the provision of the first phase of access and servicing to the site, and is able to offer up to 4 development plots for sale or lease.
The attached plan shows an indicative layout, although we hope to be able to introduce flexibility into the allocation of plots in order to accommodate individual requirements.
As with all our industrial estates land is made available for businesses who are seeking to create jobs and, in the event that you are  interested in pursuing the allocation of a site I should be obliged to receive more details of your business activities and history; the proposed use and development of any site; the reasons behind your interest in a move; and an indication of the prospects for the generation of employment.
Please do not hesitate to  contact me if you wish to discuss the matter.
Yours faithfully
Dear Madam
Thank you for your letter of 16 November making various comments about the rearrangement of southbound stops on the Bridges corridor.
I regret to note that the removal of the stop at 120 Nicolson Street makes it less convenient for you to shop at Low's supermarket.
While I appreciate the point you are making, I must emphasise that bus stops are provided in relation to overall passenger movements of which access to and from shops comprises a part.
The reorganisation of stopping patterns on the Bridges corridor was one of  simplification and grouping of services by the corridor they follow on leaving the city.
This arrangement should therefore mean that all the services which take you to Cameron Park will use the first stop on the Scotmid section of Nicolson Street.
It is not always possible for short journeys such as yours to have all services available from one stop (e.g. buses to Cameron Tool are available from both stops) but the arrangement serves a very substantial proportion of bus users.
We hope within a few weeks to move the pair of south bound stops on Clerk Street a little to the north.
I would still however consider that the stop north of Scotmid would be a little closer to  Low's shop then the next stop once it is relocated at the southern end of St Patrick Square.
Yours faithfully
Dear
APPLICATIONS FOR SUPPLEMENTARY GRANTS 1993/94
Your agency has made application for an Urban Programme grant in the round of grant submissions for 1993/94, and this letter is to keep you informed of progress in the assessment process for such applications.
The Social Policy  Subcommittee on 16 November 1992 made a change in the priority for your application within the overall package from the indication made in my earlier letter.
The application will now go forward as a
(i)
High priority,
(ii)
Medium Priority,
(iii)
Low Priority
OPTIONAL PARA- FOR PROJECTS MOVED FROM ‘NOT REC’
As this means that the application will now be submitted in two weeks to the Scottish Office, urgent contact will be made by your sponsor Dept to confirm that costings and other information is accurate for submission.
OPTIONAL PARA — for Supplementary applications raised to original levels
Your application was one of a number which were recommended only in reduced form, by following the committee decision the costs have been raised to those in your original application.
Contact will be made by your sponsor to confirm that cost and other information for the full application is accurate for submission.
It is usual for applications to be considered in total rather than by elements within them, so the full application will be approved or refused through the national competition.
As indicated previously, the Scottish Office has introduced new policy guidelines for the Programme with defined objectives which applications are obliged to address.
Your sponsor may also need additional information to meet these requirements, which are reflected in a completely new application form issued by the Scottish Office in September.
I would be grateful if you could confirm as soon as possible that you wish the application to go forward in the current year as noted here.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you would like further information.
Yours faithfully
Dear Sir
BUS STOPS, NORTH BERWICK
Your letter of 7 November to the Director of Highways has been passed on in respect of the bus stop issues although the remaining matters will be dealt with directly.
You refer to having had no reply to your letter of 9 February.
A copy of this was forwarded for our attention in early March and a reply was sent on 24 March, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.
Your request in the 9 February letter was not specific in respect of Lochbridge Road.
As there is already a  stop in approximately the location you describe I regret that I am still unclear as to what your request comprises.
Contrary to your impression matters have moved forward a considerable way in relation to the Church Road stop.
Proposals for acquisition of land from Abbey Church have been drawn up including investigation of the costs of altering the pavement and boundary wall.
An offer has been made and is under consideration by the Congregational Board.
I do not expect that this matter will be resolved immediately but I would suggest that significant progress has been made recently.
While I appreciate the point you make about the long standing nature of your request I must advise you that there are many similar locations throughout the Region where there is inadequate space to provide a bus shelter.
Only in exceptional circumstances can the administrative effort and substantial costs be justified for an exercise such as at Church Road and I hope that this is recognised by the Community Council.
Yours faithfully
ROYAL HIGHLAND SHOW — CONSERVATION AND FORESTRY AREA
Arising from the meeting on Wednesday a number of details arose which will be important in planning the site for next year.
1
If site 194 is released for extending the area I would be grateful to be advised as soon as is practical so that I can discuss details with the Forestry Commission.
There will be the need to relocate the trees and shrubs which currently bound the forestry and conservation site on its western side.
I am sure, with the Commission's assistance, that much of it can be removed to create a landscape feature against the West Mains wire fence which bounds the northern side of 194.
2
The extension will allow for the completion of the dyke where this year it was unfortunately dismantled.
If the dykers can be encouraged to begin to build an extension to the west of the present entrance off Avenue Q, their small tent can also be relocated close to this section.
3
I have advised Ken Mackay of the need for a meeting to determine the layout of the new area.
4
I attach a plan of the stand site which we have kept in reserve for NCC, now SNH.
On the matter of the catalogues, if you need assistance on what is being exhibited in this area, the themes being promoted, or any activities planned, I would be pleased to gather in the information you need  if this is the easiest way of doing it.
Yours sincerely
Dear Nigel
SCOTTISH WILDLIFE TRUST PEAT LAND PROTECTION CHARTER
The letter from  earlier in the year to the Chief Executive of the Council has been followed up by this department investigating its own use of peat — which is fairly limited.
The Charter is obviously a catch-all instrument and you will appreciate that not all of the clauses can apply to a Regional Council.
Further, policy decisions by this Council, for example, to incinerate most of the sewage sludge generated in the region, prevents any significant development of composting.
However, as a strategic planning authority, it is through the Structure Plan process that it can influence the protection of natural resources such as peat lands, and the opportunity for this will arise in the current review of the Plan which will be available for public consultation in the New Year.
Already, the tree nursery that is managed by the Pentland Hill Ranger Service has discontinued the use of peat while the Landscape Unit uses spent mushroom compost and, despite the difficult nature of sites being landscaped, peat based products are being gradually phased out.
While the principle of the Charter can be broadly supported there needs to be further consideration of its implications and the true influence that the Regional Council might have in the campaign.
The subject is one which needs to be brought to the attention of the Environment Committee and is something which the Council's Environment Officer, once appointed, may wish to tackle on a corporate basis although one which can only be a token gesture since neither the use of peat or the peat land resource in Lothian are major issues.
Yours sincerely
Dear Alan
GROUNDS FOR IMPROVEMENT AWARD SCHEME
I refer to your letter of 4 November 1992 which sought advice with regard to the opportunities provided by the introduction of the above Award Scheme.
It is important that every effort is made to ensure that the implementation of schemes is non-problematic and successful.
Very often this must involve a partnership between the school or community centre with organisations that can assist in the planning, such as the Edinburgh Green Belt Trust or the Central Scotland Countryside Trust.
However, there is no model approach and each will depend upon scale, location and objectives.
In the management of the Council's Environment Award Scheme we have frequently come across the problem of schools needing practical advice and have assisted whenever possible.
We are normally able to give advice on suppliers or local contacts, as can the District Council Ranger Services which are often very willing to assist.
While this Unit is unable to get too involved I would like to think that if an individual school required guidance, sources of materials etc., we could provide this without too much difficulty.
We might thus be able to provide the first step in assisting a school to maximise any award which it receives.
For this, the person to call on is Mrs Susan Manson of the Natural Resources Unit,(Tel: 031–469 3848) or myself on the above direct line.
Yours sincerely
Dear Paula
REFORM IN LOTHIAN: UNITARY STRUCTURES AND SPECIALISTS
Further to our meetings, I have enclosed my redrafted view of the range of specialists available within this department.
The current grades of the staff are identified.
These staff members would have to be replicated in any unitary structures that emerge following reform in this region.
As you can see, there are staff across all the divisions who perform specialist roles and particularly in the Public Transport, Programmes and Economic Development Divisions.
The findings of your own and other studies on the costs of computing, point towards our own computing staff being a resource that will have to be replicated in the new structures.
Regarding the management structures you have supplied, I suggest that for the smaller unitary authorities a second Assistant Director should be inserted in the proposed Planning Department structures.
This post would deal with development control and conservation matters with the AD you propose dealing with policy and implementation.
If you intend to pursue a very flat structure, I would delete the post of Depute Director for modelling purposes.
In the large unitary authority, the assumption is that this authority's management structure replaces the current structure in Edinburgh.
While I agree with that for modelling, we have to be aware that CEDC are instituting their own internal reorganisation.
They are likely to argue that the structures we use are ‘overblown’ and pitched so as to overestimate the costs of running a unitary City-based authority.
The proposed structure for CEDC would not, for instance, accommodate this department's management structure within Band A as defined by Touche Ross.
Yours sincerely
Dear Mr Hadley,
RAIL FACILITY TO SERVE MURRAYFIELD STADIUM, EDINBURGH
The Regional Council's Transportation Committee has recently been considering the transport implications of the redevelopment of Murrayfield Stadium by the Scottish Rugby Union.
The Committee is sensitive to the concerns of local residents about the disruption they experience when major events take place at the stadium, and has undertaken to pursue all possible steps to maximise the use of public transport to take crowds to and from matches.
To that end I have been instructed by the Committee to explore with ScotRail the scope and costs for providing and servicing a rail halt for Murrayfield.
It appears that there are in theory three different concepts to be considered:
i)
providing one or more platform faces to enable specific journeys on regular Fife line and Glasgow line services to stop to set down or pick up passengers on match days
ii)
providing a platform to allow ‘football specials’ to set down and pick up; either the siding behind the south stand or track within the Haymarket depot complex might be possibilities
iii)
providing a platform, either on the north side of the running lines or on the south side (from which passengers could reach the stadium by way of Roseburn Street) to accommodate a shuttle service from Haymarket or Waverley.
I appreciate that such proposals raise cost, operating and Health & safety issues, and would be grateful for your observations so that I may report back to my Committee.
Yours sincerely,
Dear John,
TRANSPORT INFORMATION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE
In 1991 the Regional Council published a guide to transport services for elderly and disabled people.
This took the form of a pack with a set of leaflets on various aspects of transport provision.
One of these leaflets covered Rail Services.
The pack has been well received, and we intend to produce a second edition early in 1993.
I enclose a copy of the original pack, and would be grateful if you could provide us with updated information for the rail leaflet, and any suggestions for additional material.
Yours sincerely,
Dear

If you wish to purchase one, please notify Mr F Penfold, Librarian, by telephoning 031-469-3879.
Hillend Ski Centre has the longest artificial ski run in Europe, so is by no means‘small’.
The Centre's location in the Edinburgh Green Belt and the Pentland Hills Regional Park means that there are restrictions on developments such as you describe.
An Indoor Leisure Complex and an hotel which could be sited in the urban area are unlikely to receive planning permission.
I also enclose a copy of an extract from the Lothian Region Structure Plan covering Green Belt Policy for your information.
With best wishes to your team.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
BUS STOP, WEST RICHMOND STREET
,
Thank you for your letter of 16 November 1992 following on from a telephone conversation with Mr Atkins.
While I sympathise with the points raised by Mrs White I regret that they are a result of the actions of the general public over which the Regional Council has no control.
Similar arguments can be made in respect of many bus stops and this cannot, therefore, be accepted as a valid reason for relocating bus stops.
When dealing with requests such as this we treat each on its merits, but the presumption is that an existing position is retained unless a more satisfactory alternative location is identified.
Having examined this location I regret to advise you that there are several reasons why this stop cannot be relocated as requested.
The stop has been in position for many years and is provided for within the parking arrangements and controls within the area.
A position further west on West Richmond Street is not available without removal of parking provision but would in any case place the stop unacceptably close to the previous stop in Nicolson Street.
The stop serves a wider catchment than the immediate vicinity of West Richmond Street.
Its location near the Pleasance end of the street is important for users going to or from Dumbledykes and the former Deaconess Hospital.
The stop cannot be moved nearer to the Pleasance junction without interfering with movement at that junction, nor can it be located on the Pleasance because of junctions, bends and the pedestrian crossing.
I regret therefore that I cannot assist further with this matter
Yours sincerely
Dear 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
Thank you for your letter of 23 November.
As you know I have been meeting every two weeks with all the staff in the Economic Development Team, and discussing with them each stage of the process.
Dr Elspeth Atkinson, our new Manager, starts work with us on January 12th 1993.
She is however, in the office for one day a week on a secondment basis and has met all the staff, individually and collectively to discuss the review.
Elspeth is attending Team meetings, along with Mike Gill from MSU, and the  implementation of the review is being, and will be fully discussed with all staff.
Any matters of concern can be raised directly there.
As I have said in the past, NALGO are welcome at those meetings.
I'm sure that once Elspeth is in post, matters will progress speedily with full staff participation, so that the Economic Team can operate effectively and meet the Council's objectives for them.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
COAL REVIEW
In response to your request for comments on the above issue, I am writing to inform you of decisions recently taken by two of the Council's committees.
Lothian Regional Council's Policy and Resources Committee on the 20th October, recommended that ‘the Council be party to the legal action against Professor Littlechild, in his capacity of Electricity Regulator…’
At a meeting of the Economic Development Committee on 5th November the committee recommended that:
1.
The Government should halt the issue of licences to build further gas-powered stations until it has been demonstrated that they do produce cheaper electricity.
2.
The Office of Electricity Regulation should investigate the preferential contracts between the regional electricity boards and the gas-fired power stations.
3.
Coal should be allowed to compete on equal terms with the other energy sources from home and abroad.
4.
The Government should outline, in detail, their long-term energy policy for the UK economy.
The Council also requested to be kept informed of further developments in this field.
I hope this information helps you in preparing the draft response.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
CEDC PLANNING APPLICATION N0. 2281/92 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT CAMUS AVENUE: MILLER HOMES
I refer to your consultation letter dated 16 October 1992 on the above planning application.
Lothian Regional Council commented on the previous application (No. 396/90), which was originally for 56 houses, and advised that the proposal was consistent with the Structure Plan.
You will recall that the application was subsequently amended to 89 houses (62 houses and 27 flats).
As this increase in capacity raised concerns about the lack of spare capacity at Comiston Primary School to accommodate children from the development, I requested the use of a condition to phase the rate of house completions from the site.
This was included as Condition (ix) of the consent granted by the District Council in November 1992.
Condition (ix) stated:
‘The applicants or their successor(s) shall ensure that house completions are phased so that a maximum of 30 units are completed per annum, commencing on 1 January 1992, of which 20 units shall be detached or semi-detached family houses and 10 units shall be flats, all to the satisfaction of the Director of Education, Lothian Regional Council and the Director of Planning, Edinburgh District Council.’
As I understand it, the development was to proceed in two phases.
Phase 1 consisted of 66 dwellings (39 houses and 27 flats, but subsequently varied) with access from Pentland Drive.
Phase 2 consisted of 23 houses with access from Camus Avenue.
The current application (No. 2281/92) therefore represents a minor increase in capacity from 23 to 28 houses for Phase 2.
As such, I do not consider it necessary to report this application to the Regional Council's Planning and Development Committee.
The phasing condition attached to the consent for  application no. 396/90 should also be applied to Phase 2, i.e. house completions from the whole site (Phases 1 and 2) should not exceed 30 units per annum, of which a maximum of 20 units are family houses.
If you wish to discuss this matter further with me, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
CEDC PLANNING APPLICATION NO. 1583/92 WIMPEY HOMES: HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT SOUTH GYLE (PHASE 3)
The above proposal was considered by Lothian Regional Council's Planning and Development Committee on 5 November 1992.
You should by now have received a copy of the Committee's decision and the Director of Planning's report.
Subsequent to the meeting of the Committee, representatives of the Education Department and Wimpey Homes met to discuss the land requirements for the school site.
Wimpey Homes have revised the site layout to provide for a possible future 0·2 hectare extension of South Gyle station car park and adjusted the western boundary of the school site accordingly.
The amendments are shown on Drawing No. 573/102 Revision A (dated 5 November 1992).
The Director of Education has confirmed in writing that the site shown on this drawing for educational use is acceptable.
I can also confirm that the site shown for the station car park extension is acceptable.
I have had further discussions with the Regional Solicitor on the scope for using legal agreements to ensure that the safeguarded areas can be transferred to the Regional Council as and when required.
He has confirmed my original view that the opportunity to do so has now been lost.
It is not feasible to link a Section 50 agreement to a detailed consent for Phase 3.
The opportunity to introduce a legal agreements was available when Millers' appeal to the Court of Session prevented the Secretary of State's decision to grant outline consent to the Maybury Park development from taking effect and Wimpey submitted outline application no 1463/90.
This opportunity was lost when the District Council failed to determine this application but granted detailed consent to Phases 1 and 2.
When the Court of Session action was lifted, the Secretary of State's decision to grant outline consent for the housing site became valid.
You will recall that the Secretary of State specifically ruled out any requirement for Section 50 agreements.
It would therefore appear that the only mechanism for ensuring that land is reserved is by the use of conditions.
In relation to the school site, the Secretary of State's decision included a condition that a 1·5 hectare site should be reserved for educational use.
The adopted North West Edinburgh Local Plan also sets out the planning requirements for this site.
As a last resort, land could be acquired by CPO.
In respect of the list of draft conditions included in Appendix I to my report to the Planning and Development Committee on 5 November 1992, it is appreciated that a legal burden on the land cannot be imposed by condition.
Nevertheless, the boundaries of the application site should be amended to include the school site, station car park extension and sheltered housing site.
The boundaries of these areas should be clearly delineated on a plan, and appropriate conditions should refer to those areas being safeguarded for future development.
Another difficulty arising from having to use conditions rather than legal agreements concerns the length of time for which the reserved areas can be safeguarded.
The original draft Section 50 proposed a period of 9 years from the commencement of the housing development in which the Regional Council would have an option to acquire the school site.
A planning condition would expire before this date.
I have alerted the Director of Education to the likelihood that a decision on whether or not to take up the school site might need to be taken sooner than originally thought.
A condition to specify the maximum rate of house completions for education reasons is required.
While not as watertight as a Section 50 agreement, planning conditions have been used elsewhere to control phasing.
The various highways and public transport requirements can be covered by negative conditions i.e. no houses should be occupied until the specified roadworks etc. have been completed to the satisfaction of the Director of Highways.
You will be advised in detail of the highway requirements by the Director of Highways in the next few days.
I hope that these comments help to clarify the Regional Council's position and are of assistance to you in processing the planning application for Phase 3.
If you with to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.
If you thought it would be helpful, we could meet with Alan Squair and Roger Strachan to discuss any outstanding issues.
Yours faithfully
Dear Councillor 
HILLEND SKI CENTRE INTER UNIVERSITY SKI DAY
I return  letter to you (undated) which I have copied to Hans Kuwall, DSO Manager, with whom I have discussed the request made by Edinburgh University Ski Club.
We both agree that he should be able to offer favourable terms for the hire of the slope for the proposed event, provided it is at an off-peak time.
should be advised to contact Mr Kuwall to discuss possible arrangements.
If the University requires a prime time slot on, for example, a Saturday, it may be necessary for the Club to seek sponsorship.
You will, I am sure, appreciate that now that the contract for the Ski Centre is subject to Competitive Tender, only commercially sound concessions can be offered to groups such as the Scottish Universities.
Any reduction in income which resulted, would affect both the viability of the DSO contract and the Regional Council's share of income.
Yours sincerely
Dear ,
BUS STOP
I am sorry that it has taken longer to respond to your recent telephone call  than I had expected, but I have now examined all the papers relating to this matter and have re-visited Captains Road.
I have to advise you that I am satisfied that your concerns have been properly considered, and that there are no feasible alternatives to the present stop remaining in front of your house.
The reasons have been explained in several letters to your MP or Regional Councillor on 31 March 1992, 14 April, 6 May, 4 June and 27 August, all of which I understand have been passed to you, and directly over the phone by Mr Carter on 6 August 1992.
Because of the slight bend in Captains Road to the west of No 109, it would be unsafe for buses to stop outside the shops at numbers 119/121, unless land were to be compulsorily purchased from the front gardens of Nos 113, 115, 117 and 123 to permit a realignment of the road.
Quite apart from the cost involved this would have a particularly severe impact on No 117 and is not practicable.
I believe you know already that we have no powers to instruct LRT how they should organise their services and terminal arrangements.
We have already offered, in Mr Carter's letter of 4 June to Nigel Griffiths MP, to consider siting a bus shelter at the stop, and you may wish to consider that again.
It is the Council's policy to work towards the provision of a shelter at all bus stops in Lothian where passengers regularly board and where there is sufficient space at the roadside.
The footway along Captains Road is relatively narrow, but it might be possible to provide a cantilever shelter with a solid, glazed face backing on to your fence, which should reduce further damage to the fence and hedge, and also provide some noise shielding.
If, furthermore, you wished to sell us a narrow strip of your garden to allow the shelter to be set back a little from the pavement, we could consider providing a fence along your full frontage as part of the accommodation works.
We have a backlog of sites awaiting shelters, but would give priority to providing one at this location if you consider that this would be helpful.
Yours sincerely,
Dear Alex
ROYAL HIGHLAND SHOW — FORESTRY AND CONSERVATION SITE
As you are now aware it is anticipated that the site which holds the forestry conservation non-commercial exhibitors may well be extended to include land between it and the western entrance gate of the showground.
While this will assist in allowing a better layout arrangement for the forest industry tents it will mean having to break through the landscape planting which was established by the Commission as a boundary for the present area.
Once it has been announced that the area is to be extended perhaps I could meet a member of your staff on site to consider the implications in relation to the existing planting.
I am sure much of it could be billed and relocated this winter to begin to create a new landscaped edge to the extension.
Yours sincerely
Dear Councillor 
SOUTH SIDE ASSOCIATION MEETING, 4 NOVEMBER 1992
Since the meeting I have been pursuing the proposal for moving the Clerk Street bus stops and also examining the complaints about the Scotmid stops.
To avoid creating a new problem I have had to shorten slightly the northward move of the Clerk Street stop.
The position now agreed with Highways (shown on the attached map) is at the point where the pavement widens again south of the double level section of pavement, the inner (higher) level of which is not in Regional ownership.
Had we put in the stop where I originally proposed we would run the risk of pedestrians stumbling on the ‘step’.
On the ‘Scotmid’ section of Nicolson Street our options are quite limited and after discussion with Highways we have agreed to await the implementation of the changes currently in preparation.
Highways made the point that the yellow-line alterations and refuge islands are based on the present stop positions and they would prefer that these not be altered until we have experience of the new arrangements in operation.
We will, however, investigate the options for altering the layout of the present advertising bus shelter.
We propose to have a meeting with Adshel with respect to the two bus shelters.
Unless there is a particular problem I would propose to delay altering the stops until moving the shelter can be organised as I think it would be confusing, not to say unpopular, to do otherwise.
I would however hope that this can be organised within two to three weeks.
I propose to write to the shops affected by the move of the Clerk Street stop — Edinburgh Fabrics (12/14 St Patrick Square)— to advise them of the proposal.
I am also writing to  at the South Side Association to notify her of the developments.
I am aware that these proposals only go part way to meeting the objections raised at the meeting.
I hope that the Scotmid problems will be improved by the Highways Department proposal for additional traffic islands in Nicolson Street and making Hill Place one way eastbound.
The comments I made about the narrowness of Nicolson Street at the Community Centre was based on observations from Highways to the effect that it would not be possible to fit in a northbound bus lane unless there were only a single southbound lane and no bus stop.
I hope that such a proposal will form part of the next phase of ‘Greenway’ proposals.
Yours sincerely
Dear Ewan
EDINBURGH URBAN FORESTRY STRATEGY COMMUNITY WOODLAND GRANT
I refer to your letter of 16 November 1992 which sought sites for woodland planting that would attract the Community Woodland Supplement.
While I will be unable to attend the meeting on 7 December 1992, Susan Manson will represent our interests.
I give my apologies for not being able to be present myself.
You will appreciate that we remain with little land of non-strategic value on the Council's account.
Where land is being retained for particular development in the future — such as the metro system — this cannot be regarded as available for grant-aided woodland planting.
However, we will undertake a search and report to you at the meeting.
In my mind all land/open space in Edinburgh should be eligible for the Community Woodland Supplement and I find it difficult to consider a preferential strategic plan in such an urban environment.
According to the guidelines I would assess that all residents of Edinburgh have access to a –community woodland’ if the 5 miles parameter is adopted.
My other concern is that no strategy can be competent without looking at the urban fringe — the countryside around the City, and by the nature of the Green Belt this includes land in Midlothian and East Lothian.
The Edinburgh Green Belt Trust has been discussing this matter with its funding partners and it will be important for David Oldham to discuss the various views with the Urban Forestry Advisory Group.
Yours sincerely
Dear Colleague
QUALITY AUDIT OF TRANSPORT SERVICES
I am writing to invite your comments on the enclosed paper concerning proposals to establish the basis of a quality audit of transport services, with particular reference to the needs of client groups encompassed by the Community Care Plan including elderly people, people with physical disabilities, and people with learning disabilities.
As you may be aware, the Lothian Community Care Plan (pp 53–56) includes a proposal to set criteria to form the basis of a quality audit of transport services provided by statutory voluntary and commercial organisations, which it is hoped will lead to the establishment of quality standards in the future.
I would suggest that this exercise involves two stages — firstly defining those aspects of transport services which should be covered by such an audit, and secondly, attempting to devise measurable indicators which are appropriate to use in describing to what extent transport services meet aspirations in each area.
The enclosed paper is an initial attempt to list those aspects of transport services which might be included in such an audit, in order to begin progress in this area.
I would therefore much appreciate your comments on the paper, including suggestions for aspects to be added, or deleted from the list.
I would also be interested to hear ideas relating to effective ways in which these aspects might be appropriately measured.
It is my intention to prepare a further paper taking account of the comments received, and then to invite interested parties to meet in order to discuss the way forward.
If you are able to make any responses by 11 December, this would be most welcome.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should like to discuss the matter.
Yours sincerely

FOOTBALL STADIUM, INCLUDING LEISURE, RECREATION FACILITIES AND ASSOCIATED CAR PARKING AT STRAITON ROAD, LOANHEAD
I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your supplementary information and amendments to planning application reference nos. 111/92 and 185/92.
I do not consider that the amended description of development in respect of application no. 111/92 is sufficiently explicit and, when read in association with the revised drawing no. 576/SKO2, leaves doubt as to the true nature of the application before the Regional Council.
Accordingly, please confirm as a matter of urgency that the Phase 2 development annotated on drawing no. 576/SKO2 is shown for illustrative purposes only and does not comprise part of the planning permission being sought under application no. 111/92.
Please also confirm that you are agreeable to the description of development contained in 5, of page 25 of your revised submission being amended to read ‘football stadium with ancillary leisure and recreational facilities to be accommodated within the stadium fabric, adjacent practice pitch and spectator stand, associated car and coach parking and landscaping works.’
As you will appreciate, the above is intended to ensure that there is no ambiguity about the nature of the planning permission being sought by your client.
Your early reply would be much appreciated.
Yours faithfully

I have noted your suggestion that further housing land should be allocated at Aberlady.
The Regional Council is currently preparing a Structure Plan Review.
This is soon to be published in draft and will provide a strategic planning framework for the region to the year 2005.
The draft Structure Plan Review will assess the requirement for new housing land and decide, in general terms, where it ought to be located.
Local Plans, prepared by the District Councils require to be consistent with the Structure Plan and provide the means of implementing the Structure Plan through policies and proposals for specific sites and areas.
There will be an opportunity to make your views known to the Regional Council on the draft Structure Plan Review.
After considering the responses to the draft Plan, the Council will prepare a final Plan for the consideration and approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
East Lothian District Council has decided to replace its six adopted local plans with a single District-wide local plan, the East Lothian District Local Plan.
This plan, together with the Structure Plan will provide the development plan framework.
Yours sincerely

GLADHOUSE LOCAL NATURE RESERVE BIRD HIDE
I refer to your letter of 17 August and to our site meeting on 21 September regarding the erection of a portable bird hide at Gladhouse.
As I explained at our meeting, your request would be considered at the annual Management Committee meeting for the Nature Reserve.
At the meeting, the Committee advised that permission be granted  subject to certain conditions.
Accordingly on behalf of Department of Water and Drainage, as owners of the land, I can confirm that you have permission to erect your portable bird hide at Gladhouse subject to the following conditions:
a
Permission is granted from the date of this letter until 1 April 1993.
b
The hide is sited within the area marked on the enclosed map and is not visible from the public road.
c
The hide is for your sole use.
d
You are not authorised to have access to any other areas of the Reserve other than the route to and from the hide.
e
The Byelaws for all Regional Council reservoirs (copy enclosed) are adhered to.
I suggest that you take the opportunity to introduce yourself to  who is Senior Waterkeeper at Gladhouse.
He can sometimes be found at the bothy on the corner opposite Gladhouse House.
The telephone number of the bothy is .
Please note that the official bird recorder for Gladhouse,, regularly walks round the reservoir, usually a Thursday and/or Sunday and he may cause some disturbance on those days.
I would be most interested to receive any records of water fowl noted from the hide and any other interesting records of wildlife at Gladhouse.
If you have any questions or require clarification of any aspect of this letter please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours sincerely

BEESLACK WOODS
I am aware it is some time since we spoke regarding Beeslack but I have been awaiting a response from , Senior Education Maintenance Officer concerning the tree planting proposed for the rough area in the corner of the playing field.
This is where I hope the pupils could become involved.
However  has not confirmed that he is in agreement with this as yet.
In the meantime I enclose a selection of wooden bench designs.
Perhaps we could discuss once you have had an opportunity to consider them.
I can get a local supplier to construct something very similar to design 5.6.
If this is the type of thing you had in mind I shall obtain an estimate from him.
Yours sincerely

SOUTH SUBURBAN RAILWAY LINE
Following your letter of 3 October, I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Transportation Committee agreed on 2 November that a new independent study should be carried out to assess the costs and feasibility of a half-hourly passenger service on the South Suburban route.
The delay was the result of our trying to get help with the study costs from various potential funding partners.
We did not achieve that, but the Regional Council has undertaken to carry the full costs itself.
We have invited six major consultancies to submit proposals and expect one of these to be selected, and work to begin, in January.
Yours sincerely,
Dear Sir
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) ACT 1972 LIBERTON DRIVE/ALNWICKHILL ROAD, EDINBURGH
1
I have your letter of 13 October 1992 and received the appellant's comments on the Council's Written Submission.
The following observations are submitted as the Regional Council's response to those comments:
Re para 1.1
2
Lothian Regional Council considers that the findings referred to are unreliable and based on false or unsound interpretations of Structure Plan policies and the nature of the land supply.
This is specifically so in the case of the findings of the Reporter in his Report on the SEELPI Inquiry, which the Reporter in her decision on the Linlithgow appeal referred to, adopted in respect of the Linlithgow land supply only, and that solely on the basis that the interpretation had not been challenged on the day.
Re para 1.1
3
There is no shortfall in the East Lothian HP4 supply, nor any difficulty in the availability or developability of land.
The relevance of these comments is challenged.
Re para 1.2
4
The only consequence of the Secretary of State's admission that the Drum appeal consent, issued in terms of policy HP8, could not contribute to the Edinburgh HP4 supply, was the ‘de minimus’ affect of reducing the land to meet the HP4 requirement by some 129 units.
In any event, additional land has been identified since which not only covers this but also the scale of shortfall reflected in the SEELPI Reporter's recommendations.
The HP4 requirement has been or has the potential to be met without further Green Belt loss.
Re para 1.3
5
The Regional Council has never accepted and does not accept the view that land built prior to 1991 cannot contribute towards the HP4 supply.
The HP4 requirement refers to the additional land to be allocated to ensure an adequate supply and choice of land over the Structure Plan period 1984–96.
In this regard it was estimated that the state of the established supply would be such that this additional land would not require to be available for development until 1991.
However, the flexibility built into the Structure Plan policies, as modified and approved by the Secretary of State, clearly enabled that land to be identified, allocated, granted consent, and developed prior to 1991 — to ensure that there need be no constraints on developers concerned to contribute to the supply but who had no access to the base land supply.
6
The Regional Council does not accept that the effect of the opinions referred to by the appellant are ‘informed’, ‘tested– or ‘overwhelming’, or that there is any need, let alone an urgent need, to find more land in advance of the Structure Plan Review.
Reference is made to paras 27–35, 81, 92, 94 and 107 of the Regional Council's Written Submission.
The Structure Plan Review is not late.
Re paras 1.4 and 1.5
7
Not accepted.
Reference is made to paras 4.18–4.24 inclusive of the District Council's Written Submission.
The District Council:
a
has confirmed that the Straiton site (now in Midlothian) is the only site which, on landscaping grounds, ought to be deleted from the Green Belt, to supplement the housing land supply;
b
is satisfied that the emergence of additional non-Green Belt sites has reinforced the adequacy of the Edinburgh HP4 supply;
c
did not take a view or action regarding the adequacy of the Regional five year land supply;
d
specifically did not accept the SEELPI Reporter's understanding and interpretation of key Structure Plan housing and environmental policies, but reiterated its acceptance of the Regional Council's interpretation; and
e
reaffirmed the high landscape value of the appeal site and its determination that it should remain in the Green Belt.
In short, the Regional Council and the District Council are at one on the matters referred to.
Re para 1.6
8
Not accepted.
The Gilmerton Gardens Appeal Reporter accepted the SEELPI Reporter's view that, as at March 1991, there was a shortfall in the supply of housing land to meet the Edinburgh HP4 requirement.
He, himself, did not identity a shortfall in March 1992, the context for determining that appeal then.
On the contrary, he concluded that the two non-Green Belt sites referred to ‘have the potential to offset the shortfall in the land supply which  identified and which was accepted by the District Council’.
Particular reference is made to the Regional Council's submission para 94 f (iii), pages 22 and 23.
The recent planning consent (22 July 1992) for 110 dwellings on the Liberton Gardens site and the clear potential for housing on the Moredun Institute site more than cover the March 1991 perceived shortfall of 119–140 units in the land supply to meet the 2300 HP4 requirement (the Straiton site was promoted by the SEELPI Reporter in the knowledge
(a)
that it would lie within Midlothian and
(b)
that it would contribute to the regional greenfield land supply.
9
The fact that the Local Plan has yet to be adopted is an irrelevancy.
The development of both of these urban sites and their potential to contribute to the HP4 greenfield housing requirement are fully consistent with approved Development Plan policy.
10
The Regional Council does not accept the propositions tendered in the last sentence of para 1.6.
Re paras 1.7 and 1.10
11
The proposition, in paras 1.7–1.10 of the appellant's comments, that the margin above calculated need was set at 60% over and above that calculated to provide ‘at any one moment, a five year supply of readily available private housing land’ is a grossly misleading account of the provisions made in the approved Structure Plan.
It is not appropriate to apply a 60% allowance to the Structure Plan requirement of 2,500 per annum in the period 1991–96 or to the five year housing land supply.
The Structure Plan logic for choosing to apply a 60% allowance to the new additional greenfield requirement is explained below.
12
To suggest that a 60% allowance should be applied to the Structure Plan target of 2,500 in the period 1991 to 1996 to calculate a total housing land supply for the five year period is not valid.
In other words the five year housing land supply should not be the Structure Plan requirement plus an allowance of 60%.
However, to attain the required completions, the capacity of the overall available land supply should be in excess of a minimum five years supply at all times, or at least future supplies should be assured to reduce uncertainties.
The proportion of the land supply remaining undeveloped at the end of the five year period will then be available in the following five year period.
Where choice is restricted, building rates may fall, given any state of the market.
For this reason, the 1985 Structure Plan allocates land in excess of the number of completions required from new land.
Otherwise, the land supply will not yield the target number of completions.
13
Para 8.42 of the 1985 Structure Plan states additional land for a further 3,500 completions will be needed.
As there is a limit to the number of houses which can be sold in a particular area each year, new land allocations should have a total capacity in excess of the requirement.
An allowance of 60% above the required completions has been provided.
Land with a total capacity of 5,600 dwellings will therefore be allocated.
The 60% allowance was applied to the new land allocations required by policy HP4 because the necessary completions were required in the period to 1996.
Such a high margin of flexibility was relevant because the new land allocations were essentially for development during the whole Structure Plan period and the precise rate at which new sites would be developed, whether before or after 1991, could not be judged.
14
Some flexibility is desirable for each five year period.
The effective land supply at Audit 10 (18,963) exceeds the Structure Plan requirement in the period 1990 to 1995 of 3000 + 4 × 2500 = 13000.
It should be noted that the effective land supply at Audit 10 excluded the potential from further development in the longer term in accordance with Livingston Development Corporation's private sector programme.
The effect of adding this would increase the land supply to some 20,300 units.
The current land supply already exceeds the five year requirement.
The proportion of the current land supply undeveloped after five years will contribute to the next five year period.
15
The Regional Council, for the reasons given above and in its Written Submission, paras 20–27, 81, 92, 94–99, 104 and 107, does not accept the arguments contained in paras 1.8–1.13 of the appellant's comments.
Re para 1.14
16
The Regional Council does not make the claim suggested, but is satisfied that, against the Structure Plan targets, the continuing effects of the recession and the continuing levels of build involving infill and Livingston, the requirements for a five year land supply are met.
Re para 1.15
17
The Regional Council does not accept that the regional land supply can be disaggregated and tested for its adequacy at District or Local Plan level.
The reference to 60% allowance, as explained in paras 11–14 above, is a gross abuse of the provisions made in the approved Structure Plan for the supply of an adequate amount and choice of housing land.
Re para 1.16
18
The Regional Council does not accept that to contribute to the HP4 supply land must, per se, be the subject of completions only in the period 1991–96, for the reasons given in para 5 above.
The Regional Council has not attempted to argue that increased levels of infill can and do compensate for a shortage in the HP4 supply.
It has argued that greater than forecast levels of infill demonstrate the soundness of the Structure Plan strategy; reflect the real nature of the needs of the housing market and thereby m materially contribute to the adequacy of the regional five year land supply.
Re para 1.17
19
Not accepted, for reasons already given.
The Structure Plan greenfield requirement is an integral part of the provisions for a continuing five year regional land supply and the requirements of both have been met.
Re para 1.18
20
Not accepted.
The calculations were not based ‘on the lowest expectations of demand’, but prudently forecast the scale, character and capacity of the market.
Only an approved Alteration or Review of Structure Plan 1985 can amend the approved terms of the Plan.
Re para 1.19
21
Not accepted.
Even if there were an HP4 shortfall:
a
the appeal proposal is contrary to the terms of HP6; and
b
the appeal proposal is contrary to policy EP20, in that, subsequent to the completion of the Green Belt Review of Boundaries 1988, the appellant has not demonstrated:
i
that there are no non-Green Belt or no prospect of non-Green Belt sites which might address that shortfall; and
ii
that there are no less damaging Green Belt sites in the event of a negative answer to (i) above.
In this regard, the Regional Council concurs with the view of the Gilmerton Gardens Appeal Reporter that the comparative landscape assessment submitted by the appellant is less than comprehensive.
22
Notwithstanding, the Regional Council is satisfied that, especially with the potential from the sites at Liberton Gardens and the Moredun Institute, the requirements of HP4 have been well met.
Re para 120
23
Not accepted.
The terms of policy EP19 have been fully met; in terms of policy EP20, there is no policy basis for further Green Belt losses, particularly in the context of para 21 above.
The fact that the Green Belt will be reviewed again, as part of the Structure Plan Review, is of no consequence in respect of this appeal.
Re para 1.21
24
None of the propositions tendered are accepted for the reasons given above and in the Regional Council's Written Submission.
Re para 1.22
25
Not accepted.
Even if it were to be deduced that there is an outstanding shortfall in the HP4 supply, this appeal, while being determined in the context of policy HP4, would require to be consistent with the specific terms of policy HP6, which refers to non-Local Plan proposals.
The appeal proposal fails both criteria of policy HP6.
Furthermore, in assessing the reasonableness of Local Plan proposals that address the policy HP4 requirement, the Regional Council (and any other authority charged with considering the merits of a particular proposal in terms of the Development Plan) is obliged to recognise the terms of policy HP5.
In the Regional Council's view, the appeal proposal is contrary to those terms, in that the development would precipitate unnecessary, excessive resource commitment in schools resources and to a degree that is far removed from the ‘cost effective use of infrastructure investments’.
Re para 1.23
26
The Regional Council's position as regards the implications of the appeal proposal on education were clearly recorded when it advised the District Council of its views on the appeal application (ref LRC Written Submission para 6 a (iii).
27
The Regional Council's position is as described in paras 85–88 of its Written Submission.
The impact of the likely (Audit 12) adjusted programming of the Audit 10 sites in the catchment of Liberton High School and Liberton Primary School, together with:
a
completions expected from post-Audit 10 sites at Liberton Brae, Liberton Hospital, Moredun Park Road, Southfield Hospital, Liberton Gardens, Hyvot Loan, Drum Street and Moredun Institute; and
b
the knock-back effects on closures and capacity reductions in schools elsewhere, is such that school capacities will be exceeded and excessive resource commitment precipitated.
This appeal proposal is thereby contrary to the terms of Structure Plan policies HP4/5, HP6 and HP8.
The Regional Council would wish to respond to any further new arguments which the appellant may submit.
Yours faithfully
Dear Sir
THE MIDLOTHIAN LOCAL PLAN: NOTICE OF INTENTION TO PREPARE A DISTRICT WIDE REPLACEMENT LOCAL PLAN
Thank you for your letter of the 5 November 1992 enclosing the District Councils request for information for the preparation of the district wide local plan.
I have circulated the request to the various Regional Council service departments asking them to respond not later than 18 December 1992.
You will appreciate that this is a tight timescale given the range of information requested.
I have circulated the information request to Mr lain M Paterson, Depute Director of Social Work (Planning and Coordination) on the social work issues, although as you advise there is a response already in preparation.
I have also requested the Director of Property Services (Mr R D R Galbraith) for an input as the Regional Council have significant property interests in Midlothian and the Landscape Development Unit for information concerning land rehabilitation schemes and other related issues in the district.
The information will be forwarded to you as a package as soon as it is available.
Yours faithfully
Dear Steve
‘CAMPAIGN FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE’
At its meeting on 4 November the Council's Environment Committee considered the RSPB report ‘Our Countryside, Our Future’.
In principle, the Committee supports the campaign but wishes to emphasise the role of local authorities in preparing strategic policies, implementing environmental management initiatives, and seeking to create an integrated land use of the countryside — all in partnership with farmers.
The Committee acknowledged that the report is primarily aimed at the government's policy for shifting the balance between food production and environmental care.
However, questions were raised on the types of mechanisms which can be applied to influence agricultural practices.
Mechanisms such as nitrogen quotas and a carbon tax were referred to as actual ways of introducing more environmentally friendly practices, while land zoning linked with conservation incentives, and subsidised organic farming, were seen as ways of encouraging farmers to diversify their income in a way which was more socially acceptable than set-aside.
Where local government fits into this is not so clear.
Fortunately, in my recent meeting with Peter Gordon, in discussing the criticism which the report had drawn from certain sectors, he mentioned that a second report is being prepared for Scotland which is to be launched next June.
The Committee has asked that I seek further information on the way in which the Society is developing its campaign and the nature of the second report.
Certainly, specific reference to mechanisms such as cross compliance of grants; the replacement of the ESA scheme with a countryside management incentive; the relevance of ‘Natural Heritage Area’ designation in the agricultural context; and the role of FWAG, are the types of opportunities of specific interest to the Regional Council.
The campaign is identified as being primarily directed at the government, yet, as mentioned, local authorities have a role to play.
Apart from the public launch, the campaign seems to have not been extended to seeking actual local authority support, although I may be wrong on this.
Has, for example, the support of COSLA been sought?
It would be helpful to learn more of the detail of the campaign and how the RSPB plans to develop it.
Perhaps this might be done through correspondence, to answer some of the above questions, or, in the very near future Peter might be able to go further on his explanation of the campaign strategy.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
APPEAL BY OXFORD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB PLC Application NO.
P90/NO750/0
I have recently been made aware that your Council has been involved in a public inquiry relating to an appeal for the erection of a football stadium and associated commercial development within the Oxford Green Belt.
I have obtained a synopsis of the appeal decision and note that planning permission was refused by the Secretary of State in June of this year.
My own Council is currently involved in a major appeal of a similar nature, which is to be dealt with by public inquiry commencing in January 1993.
The appeal application involves the erection of an all seater football stadium and about 30 hectares of supporting commercial development within the Edinburgh Green Belt.
The stadium is to be provided for the use of one of the Edinburgh Premier League football clubs, as a means of satisfying the requirements of the Taylor Report.
The commercial development, which includes a superstore and a substantial floor area of business space is intended to provide a cross-subsidy to fund the capital costs of the football stadium.
The Regional Council refused planning permission for the development in November of last year, and among the reasons for refusal was the lack of justification for the commercial development, and the harm that would be caused to this particular part of the Green Belt.
Structure Plan restraint strategy also features prominently.
It would be very helpful to the Regional Council in preparing its case for this inquiry to have a copy of the proofs of evidence presented by your officials at the inquiry relating to the Oxford United proposals.
If you feel able to respond to this request, the Regional Council will of course be most happy to pay your copying and other administrative charges.
I look forward to hearing from you shortly.
Yours sincerely
Dear Mr Guest
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) ACT 1972 PROPOSED MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING OFFICES AND CLASS 4 BUSINESS SPACE AT NEWTON FARM, MILLERHILL
I refer to our recent telephone conversation regarding the above proposal which was refused planning permission by the Regional Council in November 1991.
The applicant has lodged an appeal to the Secretary of State against this decision.
The appeal is to be dealt with by way of public local inquiry to commence on 12 January 1993.
One of the Regional Council's reasons for refusal of planning permission is that the proposed development falls outside the areas identified for office use in the Lothian Region Structure Plan 1985 and cannot be justified on prime land in the Green Belt as there is no essential overriding need, given the supply of office floorspace currently available, under construction or with outstanding planning permission, which is more than sufficient to satisfy development needs within the Structure Plan period to 1996 and beyond.
As background information, I enclose copies of:
a
a report dated 25 October 1991 by the Director of Planning on the applications for mixed use development at Millerhill, together with the minutes of the Planning and Development Committee on 8 November 1991 and Lothian Regional Council on 12 November 1991;
b
the grounds of appeal dated 11 May 1992;
c
a report by the District Council on sites available for office development in Edinburgh, as at 30 June 1992; and,
d
the Regional Council's first draft statement of observations on the appeal.
After you have studied these papers, I would be pleased to know if you could appear at the public inquiry to present evidence in support of the Regional Council's case and, in particular, on the supply and demand for office floor space in the Edinburgh area, and the poor marketability of Millerhill as a location for major office and class 4 business development.
Accordingly, I would be grateful if you could telephone me at your convenience in order to arrange a meeting at a mutually convenient time.
Yours faithfully
Dear Sir
MORTGAGE GUARANTEE SCHEME
I write to confirm that the Economic Development Committee at their meeting on 5 November approved your application for a loan of £300,000 under the above scheme, on condition that the existing loan is repaid in full, and subject to a first charge in favour of the Council over the whole of your existing and proposed premises at Penicuik.
I am trying to move forward the agreement with the Bank of Scotland and will keep you advised of progress.
Yours faithfully
Dear 
TAXI DRIVER TRAINING
As you know, taxi companies participating in the Taxicard scheme are required, by the terms of the agreement with Lothian Regional Council, to ensure that their drivers attend any short training course which we specify as required.
I attach a list of your drivers who, according to our records, have completed the training courses run by the Disability Awareness Action and Development Unit of 2 Hopetoun Lane, Bathgate, in accordance with our requirements in West Lothian.
As you can see, there are ten unidentified drivers who attended a session on 29 October 1991, owing to a gap in our records.
I would be most grateful if you could identify them.
I understand that there are a number of other drivers working for Newtown who have not attended the training courses, in spite of repeated requests and the correspondence of my colleague, Chris Day, on 24 July 1992 and 8 October 1992, to which we have not received any reply.
We very much hope to administer the Taxicard scheme in a spirit of partnership with taxi companies and appreciate the co-operation given to date.
However, unless we identify the drivers who have not yet been on the training courses, and ensure their attendance at sessions at an early date, we will have to restrict Taxicard work to those drivers who have already attended the training, in order to fulfil our assurance to Taxicard holders that participating drivers have undergone this training.
The sessions can be arranged at a time and place suitable to your drivers.
I would therefore ask you to contact myself or Mr Day as soon as possible in order to make arrangements for the training to be organised.
If you should have any questions, please do contact me without delay.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
SMT SERVICES 304/306
Thank you for your letter dated 29 September 1992 concerning the operation of the SMT services 304/306.
I apologise for the delay in replying to you.
The SMT services 304/306 are provided with financial support from Lothian Regional Council.
In this case the Council specifies the timetable and route to be served.
The contract for these services was let in July 1991.
Prior to preparing the timetable we carried out a public consultation in the Livingston area to ascertain if there was any suggestions that could be gainfully incorporated into contract specifications.
In preparing the timetables for these services we sought to meet the objectives of providing a series of connections between buses from central Livingston and trains to and from Edinburgh.
We also sought to provide a link for residents of Murieston to Livingston centre while the Murieston area is still developing, rather than wait for the completion of this housing area before taking action.
Another objective was the provision of a direct link between east and west Dedridge.
Possibly because the population of Murieston was then too small we did not receive any suggestions for a bus allowing residents to catch trains at Livingston South station.
I note that you suggest buses should wait at Livingston South station, thus permitting residents of Murieston an opportunity to change from trains from Edinburgh onto the services 304/306.
I can understand that this would benefit residents of Murieston.
However, for passengers travelling to the rest of Livingston there would be problems.
Their current direct journeys would be replaced by a more circuitous route around Murieston, increasing the journey times, or giving an extended waiting time at the station before the arrival of the direct bus to Livingston centre.
Such problems would inconvenience existing passengers and may deter potential users.
To retain the direct link between Livingston Bus Station and Livingston South Rail Station, as well as providing connections for Murieston, would greatly increase the cost of our contract to an unacceptable level in relation to the demand available.
For these reasons we are currently unable to use your suggestion.
However, your suggestion will be kept on file and may be of use should circumstances change in the future.
Yours sincerely

TRUST ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING: 25 NOVEMBER 1992
I enclose the minutes of the Forum meeting held on 2 November 1992.
As you are aware, in the forthcoming first annual meeting of the Trust, all directors resign but are eligible for re-election.
Although not discussed at the Forum meeting, and since the local authority directors are nominated on an agreed two year cycle, it is assumed that there is no opposition to  Councillors , and  being appointed to complete their second year.
John Palmer has been advised that the re-appointment of the Class A representatives is thus a formality.
However, should any local authority disagree with this position, would you please advise me immediately.
Would you please note that the next meeting of the Forum is to be hosted by Strathclyde Regional Council, at 2.00pm on 1 December 1992.
You will recall discussion on the addition of Clydesdale District Council as a partner in the initiative, although not as yet a member in terms of the Articles of Association of the Trust.
The Director of Planning of Clydesdale District Council has indicated an interest in attending meetings of the Forum to learn more of its role.
Unless I receive representation to the contrary I intend inviting Clydesdale District Council to the next meeting.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
ESTUARIES INVENTORY — FIRTH OF FORTH
I refer to your letter of 30 October 1992 but will need to direct you to the District Council Planning Department for much of the information that you seek.
As you are aware, the Regional Council is responsible for strategic planning and therefore does not hold information on such matters as land ownership, rights of way and industrial planning consents.
We do hold plans of the protected areas of the coastline, both SSSI's and second tier sites.
The Council has no recreational responsibilities but is responsible for a number of harbours.
For information on this, please contact Drew Jamieson of this department on direct line 031–469 3849.
It is the Department of Water and Drainage that co-ordinates the response to oil pollution events that might occur in the coastline and it is also responsible for the sewage disposal installations which are based on the coast.
Despite the paucity of information available, if you think it would still be helpful to discuss your research project then please give me a call.
Yours sincerely
Dear Paul
DUTCH ELM DISEASE: END OF YEAR REPORT 1992
It is normal for me to report to the Council's Planning Committee the end of year disease statistics and any recommendations which might be necessary in line with the management strategy.
The report also allows me to re-confirm the financial contribution that is made to the running costs of the Unit.
I would be grateful to receive your end of year report when the figures are available.
This year the Council has allocated the budgetary sum of £11,210 as its contribution to funding the management work.
Now that the season is ended it would be appropriate for your Finance Department to invoice the Regional Council for this sum.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
PORT EDGAR DEVELOPMENT
Thank you for your letter of 18 September regarding the above.
I apologise for the delay in replying.
I have discussed the points you raised with my colleagues and can now respond as follows.
1
We note your concerns regarding an increase in the number of berths and a consequent increase in the movement of craft in the vicinity of Port Edgar.
However, we would ask you to note that at present:
a
This year approximately 18% of let berths were left vacant the whole season.
b
On a fine summer weekend only about 8–10% of berth-holders are out at any one point in time.
On this basis with 500 berths the additional number of yachts out would be 14–16, and not all would remain in the Estuary.
c
Regattas are held twice a year with full consultation with FPA.
This year there was a record 80 entries and no reported incidents involving commercial traffic.
d
The Regional Council currently provides information for all boat owners on their obligations under international collision regulations and also on the FPA by-laws operating in the Estuary (see leaflet enclosed).
A wide range of classes is available in the Sailing School, including dinghy sailing, cruising and navigation, and these are generally well attended.
With an enlarged marina, the Regional Council would continue to monitor boat movements in and out of Port Edgar and endeavour to educate boat owners in  the safe use of their yachts.
2
The design of the breakwater was based on the recommendations of an engineering study prepared for the Regional Council by Sir William Halcrow and Partners, which include a computerised hydrodynamic model.
This report is presently on loan to Scottish Natural Heritage, but when it is returned I shall arrange for it to be sent to you.
3
There would be no buildings or other structures on the breakwater extension which would raise its height significantly above the existing breakwaters and thereby interfere with the radar station.
In any case, the breakwater extension would be located south of the line-of-sight to the shipping channel that runs south of Inchgarvie and should therefore be well clear of transmissions.
It is possible that for brief periods during construction of the breakwater, barges or other vessels may need to moor in positions which would affect operation of the radar station.
The developer would be required to keep such disruption to minimum and to keep FPA fully informed of the construction programme and consequent vessel movements.
4
The proposals required the removal of 579,000 cubic metres of soft silty material, of which 349,000 cubic metres would be dumped at sea.
The remainder (230,000 cubic metres) would be used to reclaim an additional area of land west of the west breakwater.
Consent for dumping would be by way of a licence issued by the Scottish Office Agricultural and Fisheries Department.
The total amount of infill required would be 1,340,000 cubic metres.
The precise source of this within the Estuary has not yet been established.
Consent for extraction would be obtained from the Crown Estates Commissioners for Scotland through the Government View Procedure.
I hope these observations go some way to addressing your concerns.
Please advise me if you require further clarification of any of these matters.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Thank you for your letter of 2 November 1992 enquiring about progress with your request for a shelter at the eastbound bus stop on Milton Road East opposite Portobello Cemetery.
This site has now progressed near to the top of our list of outstanding requests for shelters.
The site is unfortunately adjacent to residential property and before proceeding we will therefore be notifying the affected frontagers as a matter of courtesy.
If this results in objections it may affect our ability to provide a shelter.
Unfortunately, for the reason mentioned above, I cannot predict how quickly we can progress the matter.
I will, however, be writing to the affected frontager within the next few days.
Yours sincerely
Dear Dawn
THE STRUCTURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN SCOTLAND — SHAPING THE NEW COUNCILS
Thank you for inviting my views on the above consultation document.
There are a number of issues which I have discussed with my colleagues in this department and I attach a paper which identifies these.
The prime concern at this stage is with the Touche Ross Report, which appears to have wildly miscalculated the cost of Planning and Economic Development.
We are preparing a further paper which will address the options for planning and transport.
I am, however, pleased that the discussion papers now recognise that strategic planning and public transport will require special mechanisms, particularly if other than the 15 Authority option is chosen.
My view is that it will be necessary to establish four or five Passenger Transport Boards to be responsible for Transport but that these should have a different range of powers from that of the Strathclyde PTA.
In particular, they should be directly funded from the Scottish Office and have powers to raise receipts through ‘road pricing’ and parking charges.
I will write to you more on these points later.
With regard to strategic planning, the document acknowledges the need to continue with the Structure Plan system and suggests some options as to how this may be achieved.
The strategic planning arrangements should be linked in some way to the arrangements for transport rather than by way of a Planning Commission or Joint arrangements.
I need to give this some further thought.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
LITTLE MILL, LINLITHGOW
I enclose the final version of the agreement between this Council and the Linlithgow Civic Trust.
As you may know the agreement has been the subject of some discussion, but I hope that now we have a form of words which recognises the interests of both parties to the agreement.
If this letter is considered acceptable I will forward two copies to you and ask you to return one signed by your Chairman.
I think it is worth emphasising that the agreement does not commit the Trust to anything more than regular monitoring of the Little Mill.
However, there is scope, in future years, should the Committee wish to develop the site, but I recognise the limited resources of the Civic Trust and I would only wish at this stage that the Trust continues to visit the site and also encourages and supports educational visits.
The preparation of a Management Plan need not be a onerous task.
I feel it would be useful to collect all the research work, documents, etc., relating to Little Mill, including this agreement, into one file or folio of information.
A covering note would detail tasks which would have to be carried out on a regular basis and which agent is responsible for these tasks.
With forthcoming changes in local government, I feel it will be useful to have all this information held together by both the Trust and the Regional Council.
At the informal meeting I had with  and  we discussed a procedure for dealing with litter.
I attach a note which I hope you will find useful and which could be distributed to appropriate members of the Trust.
Finally, I have had some dealings with the Linlithgow Bridge Community Council and their Chairman,.
The Community Council is planning to improve the corner with the seat at the bottom of Fishers Brae.
The Regional Council Highways Department is to install a kerb at this corner and the Community Council are to plant a few trees.
It may be advantageous to both groups to liaise with each other over the monitoring of Little Mill and Fishers Brae corner.
I look forward to hearing from you following your meeting on 26 November 1992.
Yours sincerely
Dear
FWAG — REVIEW MEETING
At the meeting of the Lothian Management Group on Thursday, 4 November 1992, a number of important matters were raised which makes it necessary for all the funding partners to meet.
I have therefore arranged a meeting to be held at 2.00pm, Boghall Farm, Biggar Road, Edinburgh, on Tuesday, 8 December 1992.
The Lothian FWAG initiative is about to enter its second three year period and I am pleased that the financial support for this is virtually in place as the local authorities individually announce their commitment to the extended funding.
There are a number of matters which need to be considered by the partners as we enter this next phase.
This includes the involvement of the adviser in work contracted to the Scottish Agricultural College for which a fee is paid.
The matter has not become an issue until now but it has been the intention to involve FWAG in SAC work for the Central Scotland Countryside Trust that has brought this to a head.
I remind you that the local authorities have been concerned, in return for the core funding support, that free advice is given to farmers, and this has been the subject of discussion at various times.
The agreement between SAC and FWAG is that where chargeable work arises in the course of the College using FWAG as a consultant this is in accordance with the SAC charging schedules.
Advice has been received that such work would not be more than 5% of the adviser's time.
That apart, I believe that the Lothian funding partnership now needs to consider the Issue of fee earning in relation to the national agreement, the consequences of such work on the adviser's time, and the demands of this type which will certainly arise in the next three years.
In addition to this, I think it is appropriate that we also take the opportunity to look ahead to the next three year phase, the developing work load of the adviser and the future development of FWAG in Lothian.
I hope you can attend the meeting for which an agenda and papers will be circulated nearer the time.
Yours sincerely
Dear Walter
REGIONALLY IMPORTANT GEOLOGICAL SITES — LOTHIAN (RIGS)
A RIGS Group has been established in Lothian to identify earth science sites beneath the designation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and to secure a representative network of sites for education, interpretation, research and conservation purposes.
While the Scottish Wildlife Trust has for some time had a system for identifying second tier biological sites, primarily as a conservation mechanism, no such system has been created for geological or geomorphological sites, until now.
The attached leaflet describes what RIGS are and the various benefits associated with a local system.
The current review of the Structure Plan identified the gap in conservation measures.
This has led to me setting up a very enthusiastic and committed core group which has given itself five years to complete the assessment and documentation needs to cover the Region.
One of the principal objectives of the Group is to create a network of accessible sites for education purposes, with the co-operation of site owner.
This in turn reflects the current move to  lift the profile of the earth sciences and to provide an effective interpretation system of representative sites.
Scottish Natural Heritage has this as one of its commitments.
At its first meeting the Group considered guidelines/criteria which will be important in selecting sites.
I attach a copy of that which has been adopted in England.
You will see from this that they are not restricted to the scientific factors since the educational value can be as important, if not more, for establishing a site network.
Could you look over the guidelines in relation to this particular interest and give me your thought on how they might be improved for application in the Lothians .
Comments will be considered at the next meeting which is on 10 December.
Yours sincerely
Dear David
LINLITHGOW AREA LOCAL PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS: COLT HILL, LINLITHGOW
I am concerned regarding the reasonableness of certain recommendations made by you and decisions made by your Planning Committee of 29 September on the subject of the Final Linlithgow Area Local Plan and the interests of the developer Stewart in the development of private housing at Colt Hill, Linlithgow.
I would welcome an early opportunity to discuss the subject.
Lothian Regional Council advised the Scottish Office Inquiry Reporters that it intended to challenge Stewart's appeal on application 179/92 (SOIR Ref P/PPA/LD/246).
Lothian Regional Council, in March 1992, recorded its conditional support for the Draft Local Plan — which explicitly excluded any support for the development of housing at Colt Hill.
The Regional Council's reasoning was the same in both instances: the Linlithgow HP4 requirement had been met, despite the misguided conclusions of the Reporter in her decision on the Springfield Cala appeal (see minute of officials meeting of 13 May 1992); any Colt Hill housing proposal was/is inconsistent with Structure Plan policy HP8 in that
(a)
it would result in the unnecessary loss of prime quality agricultural land and
(b)
it would involve the Regional Council in excessive resource commitment in terms of schools accommodation.
Please, first, advise me how you were in a position to recommend the allocation and development of housing at Colt Hill without first consulting the Regional Council on a proposal which is inconsistent with approved Structure Plan policy.
As it is, your Council has effectively decided to challenge Structure Plan 1985, policies HP8 and EP5, since your decision to support housing at Colt Hill was made with no reference to timing.
This could now be used as a precedent, where developers seek consent for development contrary to policies HP8 and EP5 elsewhere in the Region.
Whereas the way now seems clear for development at Colt Hill between now and 1995/96, despite the lack of schools capacity, the two sites owned by the Regional Council, which the Local Plan will reaffirm for housing development (viz. East Braehead and Listloaning), are to be denied until after 1995 (well after the projected survival of the Regional Council — thereby constraining the prospect of capitalising on the full value of these assets).
It is clearly unacceptable, when LRC has chosen not to promote the disposal and development of its land for housing, in order
(a)
to prevent the overloading of services in Linlithgow (or excessive expenditure on infrastructure) and
(b)
to enable certain other worthy contenders, eg. Braehead West, a chance to proceed, for WLDC to deny development of one site for infrastructure reasons while overtly supporting development elsewhere with equal implications for excessive demands on schools.
Before
(a)
you proceed to Final Local Plan deposit stage and
(b)
you approve any development brief for housing development at Colt Hill, will you agree to discuss these inconsistencies?
I can advise you that Education is in no position to provide additional school places at primary and at secondary level for a number of years and should not have to defend their position against a continual demand to cope with the pupil product of yet another 30 houses, particularly if approval of Colt Hill precipitates approval of the Region's and any other like sites in the area.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) ACT 1972 PLANNING APPEAL: MACMERRY, GREENDYKES FARM
I refer to our briefing session on 10 November 1992 regarding the above, sisted , appeal.
I have asked LRDA, per Paul Furbank, to try and find out what the state of play is with Service Inns Ltd.
I will also ask the Sub-Regional Engineer for an update on the remaining drainage capacity.
I refer you to my letter of 8 March 1990 in respect of planning applications 821/89,914/89 and the Local Plan proposals of that time, also to ELDC's letters of 2 February and 20 March, for information.
I also refer you to the Sub-Regional Engineer's letter reply of 2 March 1990.
Further, I submit file notes that concern the same issue.
As I understand matters, if planning consent was issued for Phase 1, Service Inns, it ought to have been subject to at least one, if not two, Section 50 Agreements, as well as subject to the site investigation you referred to.
Yours faithfully
Dear Sir
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) ACT 1972 PLANNING APPEALS: MONKTONHALL, MUSSELBURGH
I refer to your letters of 21 October and 2 November 1992 and to  letter and enclosure of 26 October 1992. , for the appellant, tends to misinterpret the position.
The sisting of this appeal has been accepted by the Regional Council in the recent past:
a
against the prospect of the completion and the adoption of the West Sector Local Plan Review and the detailed articulation of the provisions made in this area to satisfy the requirements of Structure Plan 1985, and
b
to allow the considerations for and provisions of the emergent Structure Plan Review, insofar as they had status, to be given some, but no overriding, value in the consideration of the merits of this appeal.
Notwithstanding the above, the context for the determination of this appeal is and remains Structure Plan 1985, as it modifies or supersedes the previously adopted West Sector Local Plan.
The Review of that Local Plan has now been abandoned, but the advanced stage reached in the preparation of the West Sector Local Plan Review is a significant material consideration.
The Structure Plan Review (to 2005), under preparation, will not achieve significant levels of materiality until well after the initial Consultative Draft stage, indeed, until Lothian Regional Council has publicly determined its support for the premises, assumptions, forecasts, policies and proposals developed through the public participation process and subsequently supported by the Director of Planning.
It is now clear that the review has not reached anything like that stage of progress.
In March 1991, the Regional Council's Planning and Development Committee cleared for public consultation a range of Discussion Papers which would help to describe the issues and establish an agenda for consultation.
It was minuted that the papers did not imply a commitment by the Regional Council to particular levels of growth or policy stances and did not constitute a formal statutory stage of public consultation.
The first consultative draft and Structure Plan Review is not yet at hand, ie there is no indication of the officials' initial views as to what scale of additional development should be addressed and what strategies should be adopted to guide location and timing in the period to 2005.
Whereas it was hoped that this would be brought to the Council by the end of November, it may now be into 1993 before the first draft is presented to the Planning and Development Committee.
Even then this will be the first time a draft will have been presented to Council.
It is likely that, if it is published then, the merits of the plan and the assumptions and forecasts which it relies upon will not be approved, but merely cleared, without prejudice, for public consultation.
It certainly cannot be argued that the ‘development plan position will have been clarified’ or that the Review (or the Draft)‘will be complete and offer good guidelines as to the issues to be tackled and the Council's attitude to them’.
It may be a further six months to one year before that is true of the Council's position and, even then, the Secretary of State's subsequent consideration of any final Review submitted for approval could take even longer.
In my letter of 28 August 1992 to , I advised that the Review, not the initial consultative draft, will address housing need and supply, embrace the second Biennial Review.
The weight or level of materiality attached to the initial consultative draft was intended to be the minimum possible, contrary to the sentiments expressed in  letter.
It is the Regional Council's understanding that this appeal requires to be considered and determined in the context of Structure Plan 1985.
The merits of a planning application lodged in August 1988 can hardly be expected to be judged on the basis of a yet to be prepared and approved Structure Plan Review and District-wide Local Plan, both of which will address a future Development Plan time period.
I enclose, for your information, copies of the minutes of the Planning and Development Committee's views on planning applications 640/88 and 183/89, together with the Director of Planning's reports on each.
The Regional Council reserves the right to augment these observations in reply to the grounds of appeal.
Yours faithfully
Dear 
TAXI LICENSING
It was a pleasure to meet you at the Scottish Taxi Federation exhibition at Riccarton last week.
As promised, I would like to raise some points concerning taxi licensing which I would be grateful for your department to consider in reviewing current arrangements.
1
Wheelchair-Accessible Taxis
As you know, there is currently a wide variety in the type of vehicles which licensing authorities currently consider suitable for use of taxis.
Some Districts insist on ‘black cabs’— i.e. Fairways and Metrocabs.
These have the great advantage from the perspective of disabled passengers that models less than four years old can accommodate around 90% of wheelchair users who wish to remain in their wheelchairs while travelling.
Other Districts licence, in effect, only saloon cars, while others have a mixture of saloons and ‘black cabs’.
As different people with disabilities have different needs, the availability of some wheelchair accessible taxis in each area would be a great benefit.
In areas which are all black cab, at present, people who find these vehicles less suitable have the option of using saloon cars provided through private hire companies.
The point is, therefore, that a variety of vehicles, including some wheelchair accessible vehicles, should be available in all areas.
2
Code of Practice for Wheelchair-Accessible Vehicles
Enclosed is a document agreed with Edinburgh District Council and the taxi trade to promote good practice in respect of use of wheelchair-accessible vehicles.
Given that safety for passengers must be paramount, you might like to consider if such a code of practice should be given some statutory status, or how else the good practice it describes might be disseminated and enforced.
3
Training
The main points of the code of practice are enforced in West Lothian, Midlothian and Edinburgh by the requirement that drivers of wheelchair-accessible taxis must attend short training sessions which ensure that drivers are aware of the correct use of ramps, wheelchair restraints and passenger seat belts.
These are conducted by local voluntary organisations (Lothian Community Transport Services and the Lothian Coalition of Disabled People), and paid for by ourselves.
The sessions last approximately three quarters of an hour, and are enforced by the Cab Office.
I would commend these arrangements and again suggest that consideration be given to ways in which this practice could be extended.
I believe that the above points would be endorsed by other bodies, including disability groups and Regional and District Councils, particularly from sections who have responsibility for transport for disabled people.
The Disability Unit of the Department of Transport in Marsham Street is another source which you might like to consult concerning wheelchair-accessible taxis, as they have developed considerable interest and expertise in this area.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like any further information.
Yours sincerely
Dear David
NATURE CONSERVATION ON LOCAL AUTHORITY LAND
I refer to your letter of 5 November which sought information on this Council's involvement in nature conservation.
You have mentioned the Pentland Hills Regional Park Plan and Reservoir Conservation and Recreation Strategy, which, as policy documents which support the Structure Plan, provide direction on nature conservancy matters in particular strategic areas.
The following lists other areas in which the Council has taken a lead and, to varying degrees, also involves local authority land.
1
Establishment of River Almond Initiative with Central Scotland Countryside Trust.
2
Setting up of Water of Leith Conservation Trust.
3
Core funding of FWAG-Lothian adviser.
4
Establishment of Gladhouse Local Nature Reserve.
5
Management of Bavelaw Marsh Nature Reserve.
6
Transfer or lease of Tailend Moss, Petershill, Hermand Birchwood, Linhouse and North Addiewell Bing for management as nature reserves to Scottish Wildlife Trust.
7
A ‘Wildlife Strategy’ for Edinburgh Green Belt.
8
Creation of Edinburgh Green Belt Trust with conservation as one objective.
9
Setting up of a ‘Regionally Important Geological Sites Group’(RIGS) to promote conservation of earth science sites.
10
Introduction of management regime for roadside verges in association with Highways Department.
11
Introduction of ‘Environment Award’ to encourage nature conservation work.
12
Development and implementation of management plans for reservoirs.
13
Creation of ‘Village Nature Parks’ with Central Scotland Countryside Trust.
14
Safeguarding of ‘second tier’ wildlife sites identified  as Council land.
15
Management of Dutch Elm Disease Control Programme for City of Edinburgh and replacement planting on own land.
16
Survey and database creation to include all trees on Council land within Edinburgh.
17
Management of woodlands on the Water, Education and Planning accounts.
18
Improvements to school grounds for nature conservation.
The implementation of policy leads us into many aspects of nature conservation not necessarily just on the Council's own land but as you work for Fife Regional Council you will understand the ramifications of local authority influence.
Yours sincerely
Dear Sir
SCOTTISH WILDLIFE TRUST — WILDLIFE SITES LOCAL PLANS AND DEVELOPMENT CONTROL
At a meeting on 8 October 1992 hosted by this department and attended by representatives of District Council Planning Departments and the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the Trust indicated that following a re-survey of sites in Lothian, an updated list of Wildlife Sites with relevant maps will be made available to district planning authorities in Lothian early next year.
During the course of the meeting it was suggested that each Planning Department should nominate an appropriate member of staff to be the ‘contact’ person with the Scottish Wildlife Trust in relation to Wildlife Sites.
The Trust would address all correspondence and updates relating to Wildlife Sites to the nominated person and if possible that person would be made known to other members of staff within the Department as the ‘holder’ of the information on Wildlife Sites.
On behalf of the Trust I have agreed to contact each Planning Department and obtain the name of the individual concerned.
I would be grateful if you could inform me of the person in your department who would be dealing with the register of Wildlife Sites.
I look forward to hearing from you soon and, if possible, by 11 December 1992.
Yours faithfully
Dear Alan
HILLEND: SNOW MAKING MACHINE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
I would be grateful if you would provide an estimate for undertaking the work necessary to review the impact of a snow making machine which is to be installed at  Hillend Ski Centre.
When you have considered the brief provided can we please discuss the detail and objective to allow me to expand on any points before you make a response.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
Grant and Loans available in Lothian Region
Thank you for your recent letter requesting information on grants and loans available for new businesses in Lothian.
Due to the wide number of organisations providing this type of assistance Lothian Region Development Authority (LRDA) concentrate their direct grant aid on existing businesses wishing to develop, however, I have enclosed a list of the grant funds available from other organisations.
You may also like to contact the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce (3 Randolph Crescent, EH3 7UD or Tel: 225 5851/3) who have a database containing details of assistance available throughout Scotland.
LRDA produces a monthly listing of vacant properties in the region which may be of interest to you if you are still seeking workshop premises.
If you wish to be added to the mailing list please give me a call on the number above.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
KIRKNEWTON: BUS SERVICES
Thank you for your letter dated 13 September 1992 concerning items raised at the meeting of Kirknewton Community Council held on 9 September 1992.
I apologise for the delay in replying to you.
The points raised in your meeting have been taken up by Councillor , Lothian Regional Council, who has also been in contact with me.
I have passed on the suggestion in item 9, the position of the bus shelter, to the Public Transport Unit's Bus Stops and Shelters team for their consideration.
I note the comments made by a  regarding the local bus services available to Kirknewton residents.
He stated that –Lothian Regional Transport –'; provide subsidies for local bus services.
There is often confusion about the roles of Lothian Regional Council and Lothian Region Transport plc.
Lothian Region Transport is a bus company which, although owned by the Council, acts independently as though it were a privately owned firm, it has no powers or funding to subsidise bus services.
The role of Regional Councils, including Lothian, is controlled by the Transport Act 1985.
Under this Act Councils have a duty to provide financial support for local bus services that are socially necessary, but which would not otherwise be provided on a commercial basis by bus companies.
However, Councils are not allowed to support journeys that would compete with commercial services.
Kirknewton is served by the S.M.T. services 281 and 285.
The extensions of service 281 from East Calder to Kirknewton and all of service 285 receives financial support from Lothian Regional Council.
informed your meeting that Ratho was linked to Edinburgh by 15 return journeys per weekday and 20 single journeys on Sunday.
These journeys, operated by Edinburgh Transport and S.M.T. under contract to Lothian Regional Council, are specified so as to give residents of Ratho an opportunity to reach the nearest large shopping and business centre, which happens to be Edinburgh.
In Kirknewton's case the nearest large settlement is Livingston, to where the service 285 provides 15 return journeys per weekday and 26 single journeys on Sunday.
Therefore Kirknewton is not badly served by local bus services in comparison with Ratho.
In addition, Ratho is considerably further away from a railway station than Kirknewton.
A point was made that in the morning the S.M.T. service 281 from Kirknewton to Edinburgh is routed via East Calder.
This is because of limits on what local authorities can support financially.
We cannot support all of a service into Edinburgh, as this would be additional to the 1020 commercial journeys counted by .
Following requests for a direct service to Edinburgh an opportunity arose to extend two duplicate journeys that S.M.T. proposed to operate commercially from East Calder.
Direct journeys from Kirknewton are possible because of the commercial provision which starts at East Calder, hence the route adopted for the morning journeys.
At your meeting it was mentioned that the S.M.T. service 66 appeared to run from Livingston to Balerno.
I have asked S.M.T. about this issue.
I was informed that buses from Livingston depot were deployed to operate journeys starting from Balerno.
However, between the depot and Balerno the buses ran out of service.
This arrangement had resulted from the closure of the company's New Street depot in Edinburgh and the need to base vehicles at other depots.
Since the 26 October 1992 the service 66 has been operated by buses from Westfield Avenue in Edinburgh and Livingston based vehicles are no longer required.
Your meeting also highlighted a 10p differential in fares between Kirknewton and Edinburgh, depending on whether a journey was made during the morning or evening peak.
With regard to this problem, S.M.T. have agreed to standardise fares at £1.50 in each direction.
Yours sincerely

LOTHIAN RIGS GROUP
The inaugural meeting of the Lothian RIGS Group was held on 10 November 1992, chaired by , past President of the Edinburgh Geological Society.
The core members of the group set out the working arrangements and discussed matters such as the recording system to be adopted, guideline criteria for site selection, and the start of the assessment programme.
It was agreed that the core membership will be augmented by experts, as and when necessary, according to the nature of sites being discussed.
An open invitation was also agreed for any District Council representative to join meetings.
This will be of particular interest to you when sites within your District area are being considered.
To accommodate this you will receive the minutes of all meetings and agendas.
Until Easter monthly meetings have been agreed, which reflects the commitment and enthusiasm of the members to the task which the Group has set itself.
The core group members are all volunteers and do not represent the organisations they are associated with, either professionally or as volunteers.
There is, however, a considerable networking capability within the group and as a consequence there will be active liaison between the various professional and voluntary bodies.
A member of the mineral trade association is being sought to ensure that there is also adequate linkage with the commercial sector.
An active link with the regional office of SNH will also be established.
One of the first tasks of the group is to agree the criteria for site selection.
I attach a copy of that which has been adopted for RIGS in England and Wales.
If you have any comments on these then perhaps you might pass them to me unless, of course, you wish to attend the next meeting.
As an indication of the partnership involved the Group agreed to accept invitations from the individual members to accommodate meetings.
The next meeting is being held at the Pentland Hills Regional Park Headquarters, Boghall Farm, Biggar Road, Edinburgh, Midlothian, on Thursday, 10 December 1992 at 7.00pm.
Yours sincerely
Dear 


Thank you for your letter of 2 November 1992 regarding the problems associated with the above property.
Generally, it is difficult to ensure that building works are completed once planning consent has been granted.
However, if unauthorised activities are being carried out on the site, these would require planning permission and enforcement action could be taken.
Appropriate action in this case will depend on the details of the permission and current progress matters which the District Council dealt with and upon which I have no information.
 Accordingly , I have passed a copy of your letter to the Enforcement Officer at the District Council so that he can provide you directly with the information which you have requested.
Yours faithfully
Dear Councillor ,
KIRKNEWTON AREA BUS SERVICES
At the meeting of the Transportation Committee on 5 October 1992 you asked for a report on bus services in the Kirknewton area.
I understand that you have discussed the possible contents of a report with Clive Brown.
You suggested that S.M.T. may be willing to operate the extensions to the service 281 journeys to and from Edinburgh on a commercial basis, assuming the demand has increased sufficiently since the extensions were introduced.
This would release resources within the existing budget to use in increasing bus service provision for Kirknewton.
We have discussed this possibility with the company and have been informed that they are unwilling to take on the operation on a commercial basis.
Therefore we have been unable to report the hoped for release of financial resources to use on other services.
The outcome of our approach has been included in the report to show the current position.
The report also contains information on the public transport services available, including rail services to complete the picture.
The issue of a link to Balerno has been covered by the report.
The Public Transport Unit has no evidence of demand to justify the likely cost of the service.
Therefore we have not felt able to include a recommendation that financial support be given for a Kirknewton to Balerno service.
I enclose a copy of the report for your consideration.
In the light of the report's findings you may want to discuss the matter further.
If so, please contact Clive Brown on 3893.
Yours sincerely
Dear Billy
VISIT BY HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS ROYAL
I am writing to thank you and your staff and volunteers for co-ordinating the Royal Visit on Monday on behalf of all of us at Lothian Regional Council.
You all deserve congratulations for ensuring that the visit was such a success, and I am sure that it will be a great boost to all concerned with the project on its first birthday.
Many thanks.
Yours sincerely
Dear James
I am very grateful for the opportunity that you gave me to speak to the NFU Branch Committee on Thursday last.
It was particularly valuable to learn of some of the principal concerns that exist and are obviously discussed by the committee from time to time.
If it is appropriate perhaps the opportunity might be offered again next November, but the value of the meeting has to be guided by the views of the Committee.
If I return to the matter of improving liaison is it possible that I might be provided with a list of the names of the various staff that serve the Branch and also the names of the Committee members- and this updated at whatever time of year the membership changes.
This would help me in ensuring that project staff are alert to the need to establish links when new initiatives are being considered.
The experience of the River Avon project which was raised by one of the West Lothian members illustrated that while a particular effort had been made to inform the West Lothian secretary, the  mechanism was still not right.
This can be improved on generally.
Briefly, I would like to identify some of the key points which were discussed.
Firstly, it is anticipated that the draft Structure Plan will be available for public consultation after 13 January 1992.
While the new policies, in their draft form, arise from analysis and consultation, they are there for the public to assess and comment.
If the Committee wishes to take up the offer of a presentation of the plan perhaps Bob Allan could advise me of your meeting dates in January and February.
The Pentland Hills Regional Park Subject Local Plan will be reviewed over the next year.
This will provide the opportunity to look again at policies but will also allow for the management plan aspect to be updated.
The current plan runs until October 1994.
Its review begins next year with the anticipated publication of the draft plan at the end of 1993.
The value of involving the Committee in the consultation mechanisms will be relayed back to the Park Manager.
Both the Central Scotland Countryside Trust and Edinburgh Green Belt Trust are establishing links with farmers and the NFU in various ways, perhaps the latter being much more effective in this.
That said, the comments raised will be referred back to the project officers and in West Lothian, in particular, there is room for improvement.
The continued support for FWAG is encouraging and I reiterate the conclusion Scottish Natural Heritage staff and I have reached in that a second adviser is going to be needed within the next three years.
I understand that  has not been invited to speak to the Committee yet but perhaps you might consider this at the time of him producing his annual report next April.
The move towards improved liaison between landowners and Water Department staff in catchment areas, is, I hope, a more positive approach to concerns about pollution than the application of byelaws.
It requires goodwill on both sides and as far as the Regional Council's role is concerned I shall be monitoring the development of the arrangements.
Finally, I started and finished the presentation on the re-organisation of local government.
Whatever the outcome, the liaison needs of the Branch Committee cannot be ignored and so I hope over the next three years that this can be improved to enable a transition through which active liaison is maintained.
Again, many thanks for providing me with the opportunity to meet the Committee, it was very helpful.
Yours sincerely
DRAFT NOTE TO DBM REF.
DELIVERIES/DISTRIBUTIONS
Please find attached a draft note for DBM of our deliberations on 12 August.
I should be grateful if you could make any amendments on your copy and return to me as soon as convenient.
With thanks.
STANDARDS DOCUMENTS — CHARGES
Further to our discussion at DBM I attach initial costs of Standards Documents.
Jean Downie advised a 10% addition to cover overheads.
However, given the actual staff time involved in production of the Standards I think this is a rather low percentage and gives us a somewhat unrealistic final cost per unit.
For Information: Visit: 3 attorneys from North Carolina to Edinburgh South West.
Bryan Chatham has been asked by Chief Superintendent  of Lothian and Borders Police HQ, to host a visit from 3 attorneys from North Carolina on Wednesday 13 October.
Bryan is prepared to arrange a programme once he has more details about their specific interests.
I have said we will be pleased to provide back-up with visitor's packs etc and that I would inform you of the request.
SOCIAL WORK STRATEGIC PLAN 1993–96
John Chant asked how the above was progressing and I explained that we have had initial draft typeset — he has asked to see a copy which I have passed to him today.
I attach a copy of the distribution list for the Community Care Plan.
This is a combination of the list we used for the first plan and the list used for the draft of the second plan.
I should be grateful if you would let me have any amendments or omissions a.s.a.p.
Would you also confirm that the plan is not to be accompanied by a letter.
The covers are being produced at the moment and I have asked Margaret Lockhart at CPU to get estimates for copying the contents and combining with the cover and binding so that this can be done a.s.a.p after the September Social Work Committee.
Once the report is ready for distribution I hope Planning and Co-ordination will be able to give us some assistance as you did with the first plan.
This will enable the distribution to be completed over a shorter period.
Copies of the plan remaining after distribution will have to be stored by Planning and Co-ordinations Section.
I shall be on leave week beginning 13 September for one week.
Nigel Scott is the contact in Business and Communications in my absence.
Thank you for the article for the Newsletter and the two translations of the leaflet.
Perhaps we could discuss these when you get back from holiday.
Would you please let me have the photos we supplied for your exhibition, so that they can be added to our stock and used by other people.
EMERGENCY ALARM SYSTEM
I have now had an opportunity to discuss with relevant staff the intention to re-site the emergency alarm system to cover the reception area.
The arrangements are as follows:
one monitor panel to be sited in room 108 where previously indicated by Nancy Brown to Bob Inglis, ie on the inside corridor wall of room 108, above the door;
the second location is room 116.
Currently one staff member has her back to the door and if the other two staff were absent she would not see the light flashing.
It has been suggested therefore that the monitor panel might be sited on the pillar between the two windows so that it is in the line of vision of staff.
However, should there be any difficulty in siting the panel on the pillar, perhaps one of you could discuss with the Publicity Assistants an alternative and suitable site.
I know that it is intended to begin wiring around 1 September 1993 and that it will be a week or so before the actual switchover from room 202 to the above sites takes place.
As discussed verbally, it is important to have at least a couple of days notice as we are currently finalising the procedure that staff will follow should the alarm be activated and it is important that everyone knows and is satisfied with the procedure before its introduction.
I received a phone call today (24 August) from the journalist , ex Social Work Today and now editing Care Report Scotland — SCVO's Community Care Magazine.
He is looking for a contact in each region who he can ring monthly to find out what's happening in the Community Care field that would be of particular interest to the Voluntary sector e.g. contracts, consultations etc.
Jane Saren would seem to be the obvious person, but perhaps you would let me know whether you would like me to approach Jane to see if she is willing take this on, or if you would like it handled in some other way?
Yours sincerely
.
Please find attached details of the proposed hours of Reception staff to be undertaken on a trial basis from 6 September to 4 December 1993.
Whilst we will review after the initial 3 months period I should be grateful if we take the arrangement up until the end of the calendar year so that it continues to operate whilst being reviewed.
TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE, RECEPTION, SHRUBHILL HOUSE
Katrina Sweeney who uses an electric wheelchair and who was previously on placement with us, will again be assisting in reception only for 3 weeks from Monday 13 September to Friday 1 October from 10.00 until 2.00 each day.
I thought you should be informed for 2 reasons:
a)
in case there should be any fire alarms during this period (which should not cause any difficulty as Katrina will be located on the ground floor) and
b)
in case the alarm for summoning assistance to reception is still located in room 202 during that period.
Reception — Hours of work
As previously discussed the proposal to change the hours of duty to the following — will commence on a trial basis as of 6 September 1993.
Early member of staff commences
8.15am — 4.25pm Monday to Thursday
8.15am — 3.35pm Friday
45 min lunch
Late member of staff commences
8.45am — 4.55pm Monday to Thursday
8.45. am — 4.05pm Friday
45 min lunch
This will run for a 3 month trial period and will be reviewed after this period.
Emergency Duty Team will retain the lines until 8.15 each morning and take the phone lines back at 4.55pm/4.05pm.
In the event of an emergency i.e. receptionist delayed, EDT will hold the lines until a member of the reception staff takes over.
In the event of sickness/annual leave the remaining member of staff will cover from 8.15am until 4.55pm/4.05pm, with assistance from other section staff to cover breaks.
Hours accrued during this period will be taken at a later date in accordance with cover.
At present the duty caretaker covers the phones on a stand-by basis from 8.00 till 8.30 and from 4.40 till 6.00.
When the new system is introduced the caretaking staff will not be amongst those identified as operators and it is intended that these revised hours will assist caretaking staff by freeing them for more appropriate duties.
EDINBURGH UNEMPLOYED WORKERS CENTRE
Thank you for the correspondence regarding the above (memo from Les McEwan to Bill Lang, 6 July 1993 and memo from Bill Lang to Les McEwan, 5 July 1993).
It was useful to know of the expectation that Business and Communication check local papers regarding any adverts relating to the Centre.
I myself did not know anything about this and having checked with Gillyan Ford and all Publicity Assistants, found that they too had had no previous indication of the requirement to scan adverts.
Initially, we were a little uncertain as to the type of adverts to seek and in both your absences I checked with Gerry Senior who was very helpful in advising that we would be looking for the kind of events that might be held in the Centre and not adverts relating to, for example, recruitment.
The only local paper that we get on a regular basis is the Evening News which is scanned daily.
I am asking staff to keep a look-out for any advertisements that relate to events in the Edinburgh Unemployed Workers Centre and take cuttings of any that are relevant.
INFORMING THE PUBLIC: SHARING IDEAS/EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL WORK DEPARTMENTS IN SCOTLAND
At our last meeting, you asked me to give you a reminder regarding the above.
You were going to contact someone in ADSW (I regret I forget the name) with regard to the possibility of setting up some form of Communications Group representing all Departments in Scotland that would meet perhaps every quarter or half year.
Now that we are all required to provide information to members of the public regarding aspects of our services:
Complaints Procedure Leaflets and Posters
Standards
Assessment and Care Management
Range of Services Available (to make choice a reality)
to name but a few, it would be sensible if those of us responsible for production, came together on occasion to swap information, provide each other with examples of material produced, discuss difficulties experienced with regard to reaching specific target audiences, use of alternative formats (ethnic minority languages etc.)— generally a forum which would provide an opportunity to share methods and experiences.
I've spoken to Helen Wright at WEDGE and she thought what we are planning to put on tape would meet the needs of her clients with learning disabilities i.e. to ask someone to help them write or phone if they can't do it themselves.
I've written a sentence which I think sums up the tape and introduces it which I think would do for both leaflets.
Alternatively you could substitute:
‘This tape will tell children and young people what to do if they have…’
on the Children's tape, although the first sentence inside makes it clear that it's a leaflet for children/young people.
If this is okay with you I'll send them to SBP to be put on to tape.
COMMUNITY CARE MATTERS NEWSLETTER
I am replying to your memo to Pat Gaudin of 10 May with apologies for the delay.
We had planned an edition of the Newsletter in June but this has not happened.
The next issue is now scheduled for September.
I attach a copy of the distribution list so that you can see who got the previous edition.
We have not received any Community Care Newsletters from other regions in Scotland including Tayside, and I would appreciate a copy of this to compare.
We have not asked for contributions from the voluntary sector in the past as the Newsletter was viewed more as a vehicle to let staff and others know about how Community Care was being implemented from a Social Work Department perspective.
However, I will pass your suggestion on to Tony Sabine and Sue Brace who are responsible for the contents of the next edition.
Sorry not to be of more help.
COMMUNITY CARE LEAFLETS — REPRINT
I have now worked out the numbers of the 7 client based leaflets we have distributed over approximately 1 year.
It is difficult to estimate how many of these leaflets will be used subsequently but stocks of the 3 leaflets we have already reprinted (Learning Disabilities, HIV/AIDS and Drugs) stand at a quarter of the original print order.
In order to have stocks of the remaining 4 leaflets in the same ratio we need to order:
Elderly: 2,500
Physical Disability: 3,000
Mental Health: 2,500
Alcohol: 1,500
I should be grateful if you would confirm that these seem like reasonable quantities to you and also that only the amendments I have marked are required.
Please return leaflets.
LEAFLET; FOR PARENTS WHO LIVE APART
I wonder if you could give me some idea what a leaflet similar to the attached would cost to produce, i.e. one spot colour throughout and full colour cover, say, 10,000 copies?
Many thanks
SOCIAL WORK IN LOTHIAN LEAFLET
Stocks of the attached leaflet have almost run out and as this was always intended to be an interim in-house production we now feel we should produce a glossier version on a better quality paper in the style of the leaflets we have recently produced for Community Care and Assessment.
I should be grateful if you would confirm that the changes I have marked are the only ones necessary.
HOME CARE LEAFLET
I understand this is going to DMG on 3 August 1993 after John Chant has looked at it.
Assuming this means we are near a final draft we should meet to discuss cover design.
I understand you are also doing a Day Care leaflet which should, presumably, be part of the same family.
Could you give me a ring (ext 8281) when you return from holiday.
I'll be back on 27 July.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION LEAFLET FOR SOLICITORS
With reference to the above leaflet which you are drafting, Business and Communications are receiving many requests for this information from Solicitors.
I should therefore be grateful if you would let me have the draft as soon as you have completed it.
With thanks
INFOSHEETS
Can I assume as you did not reply to Pat Gaudin's memo of 28 June 1993 that you want the Infosheet on Services to People with Mental Health Problems withdrawn from the Infopack?
This will mean that mental health is the only area of the departments’ services not covered in the pack.
INFOSHEETS
Unfortunately the CIG meeting on 14 July, at which it had been planned to discuss the revamping of the Infopack, had to be cancelled because of the large number of apologies due to holidays and sickness.
As it will not be possible for the group to meet again before October we are going to go ahead and reprint the Infosheets for Field Services/Hospitals, Children and Families, Voluntary Organisations and Mental Health with amendments as an interim measure.
In view of this change of plan I should be grateful if you would confirm that we can go ahead with your rewrite — a copy of which I attach.
DRAFT OF  JOURNALIST'S ARTICLE FOR GORGIE/DALRY GAZETTE
I do hope that you received my message.
I regret that I had been out of the office on the 15 July and did not receive your FAX until first thing on the 16 July.
Basically my message said that I could make some general comments mainly relating to style rather than accuracy but if the deadline had passed so be it.
My apologies for not being able to reach you earlier or in person.
REGISTER OF TASK GROUPS AND STANDING GROUPS
Some time ago Pat Gaudin asked DSPG Members for details of any task/ standing groups with which they were involved, in order to prepare a comprehensive register.
Standing groups were to be sub-divided into:
Internal
Inter-departmental
Inter-agency and
COSLA/Scottish Office.
Responses were slow and despite subsequent requests, amendments/additions/ deletions were not forthcoming.
We have, however, been gathering information on task/standing groups as it arose at various Senior Management meetings.
We are now in a position to set up a computerised database of these groups, but before proceeding any further and given the time-lapse since the original proposal to establish such a facility, I wonder if you could confirm that this would still be a useful tool and that it is within the original thinking.
Harry Murrell rang me in reply to my letter of 21 July to Ken about Req No 239886.
He takes on board that the time taken for this job was too long but insists that the only thing accompanying the forms was a handwritten note from you asking them to change 1600 — 1650 on SW143 and 1605 to 1655 on SW142.
I told Harry that I didn't really see how this could be resolved in your absence so we should just leave until you return from holiday.
‘Child Protection’ Organisation
I attach copies of recent correspondence with Leslie J McEwan, who as Depute Director of the Department of Social Work, chairs the Lothian Child Protection Committee.
Details of the Constitution and structure of this Committee, on which Roger Williams, Depute Director (Advisor Division), represents the Education Department are also attached.
Since receiving this correspondence, I have met with David Wilson who is the Regional Coordinator Child Protection based in the Social Work Department HQ at Shrubhill House, Shrub Place, Edinburgh EH7 4PD, Tel 031-553-8294 to further clarify the requirements of the Child Protection Committee particularly in relation to and as it affects the Community Education Service and also to learn of his role in relation to this.
At the meeting, I further clarified the position as follows:—
1.
Two new Help-line organisations are being established by local independent Groups and are operating in Lothian at the moment (ie Child Watch and Help-line for Children) and others may also appear.
2.
Since such organisation do not offer direct care as such, it is unlikely that they will have to register with the Social Work Department's Registration and Inspection Unit.
3.
The concern about such organisations, no matter how well intentioned they may be, is that unscrupulous individuals could be involved with them and the lack of inspection requirements would make this difficult to prevent.
4.
It would be helpful to David Wilson to know if either of the organisations named above or any other similar organisation has been in touch with you or any of your staff and also to indicate to him the nature of this contact and details of what was being offered.
5.
Apart from such Helplines, David Wilson also offered to provide advice on situations CE Staff may come across involving adults in direct touch with children and young people where there is the slightest concern about a specific group or an individual in a group with whom staff work.
6.
While the Guidelines on Child Abuse produced by the Regional Council are currently being revised, the current version is still valid and should be readily available to all staff.
Copies should be available in all establishment.
7.
The Scottish Office has been approached with regard to the Education Department being required to carry out SCRO checks on Volunteers working with young people in education settings.
As you know this is done by the Social Work Department for their volunteers as required by a Scottish Office circular.
8.
Finally, David Wilson confirmed that he would be prepared to offer advice to any member of CE Staff who contacted him to address any specific issues.
I hope, that you find this information of assistance.
However, please do not hesitate to contact me if further clarification is needed prior to it being distributed.
For the attention of Mr A D King
CLOVENSTONE GARDENS, RETAINING WALL CHECK
Following your memorandum of 5 August 1993 regarding the above retaining wall, the structure has been checked for the common modes of failure and appears to perform satisfactorily.
The following points, however, should be incorporated in the design:—
a)
Overbreak to the front of the wall shall be backfilled in C7.5P concrete to allow adequate resistance to sliding.
b)
Notes should be added to the drawings to ensure that
i)
the top layer of blocks/copes are set on a suitable mortar bed such as Marshall's M-fix as suggested by the manufacturer,
ii)
the 100mm diameter UPVC pipe is adequately tied-in to the roadworks to provide positive drainage for the wall,
iii)
all blockwork shall be based on a ‘close bonded’ construction to provide adequate weight against overturning and sliding.
c)
It would be prudent to consider the use of a layer of Terram 1000 geotextile, or equivalent, to cover the backfill/drainage material to reduce future maintenance.
Alternatively the geotextile could be ‘wrapped’ around the drainage material.
This would be soiled over to give a better finish than presently shown.
For the attention of Brian Leslie, Health and Safety Adviser
PROPOSALS FOR A PILOT OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SCHEME
Thank you for your memo of 8 January 1993.
I now write to confirm the contents of our meeting on 18 January 1993 and provide the information requested by you.
1
The department would wish to utilise the following elements in the pilot scheme:—
a)
pre-employment screening
b)
medical referrals
c)
welfare counselling
d)
Health Education/Training
e)
Advice and Guidance
2
The Department of Highways has approximately 1100 employees on the payroll at any one time.
3
APT & c Staffs and Manual Workers.
4
During the last year 92 APT & c staff and 33 manual workers were recruited.
Following approval by the Personnel Committee, I will arrange for the item to be discussed at the two departmental joint consultative committees, prior to implementation of the pilot scheme.
HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1992 ALDERSTON HOUSE: GARDEN COTTAGE
Thank you for your memo of 14 December 1992.
I note with concern the contents.
Oatridge Agricultural College are tenants of the Department of Highways and their tenancy of Garden Cottage was formalised by your own department, details of which should be on file.
The Walled Garden was originally utilised by the Special Programmes Co-ordinator located in MSU.
A YTS scheme was located there.
This was then subsequently taken over by Oatridge College and this department was not involved at that time.
I think negotiations involved your own department, Education and DoMIS at the time.
If the Walled Garden and Garden Cottage were to be transferred to the ownership of Oatridge Agricultural because of the previous set out in the above piece of legislation this would have very serious consequences to the capital value of what can only be described as the department's most valued property asset.
Could you confirm whether the Regional Solicitor has been approached for advice on the interpretation of the relevant Clauses in the above Statute.
The Director of Highways' position on this matter is that he will resist the transfer of ownership of the above property asset to Oatridge Agricultural College.
I shall await your further advice and guidance with interest.
EUROPEAN SUMMIT — FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER: FLEXITIME ARRANGEMENTS
The Directorate have discussed the disruption to travel arrangements which will be experienced by staff working in the city centre on Friday 11 December as a result of the European Summit.
The Directorate have agreed that staff who are able to arrive at work early should be encouraged to do so and the following arrangements will apply:—
l
The doors at 18/19 Market Street will open at 0700 hours for staff wishing to start early and leave early.
2
Staff should clock in on arrival and again on departure.
If staff are arriving before 0800 hours and leaving before 1515 hours they should complete a manual adjustment form for Friday 11 December 1992 in the normal way excluding any starting and finishing times.
Staff should mark with a large *EC Summit under the column headed ‘Purpose’.
The form should then be signed and properly authorised.
3
Staff wishing to avail themselves of this flexitime arrangement should discuss it in the first instance with their line manager.
The department will be open to the public and other departments as normal, ie 0830–1550 hours, therefore minimum staffing levels will need to be applied in every section.
4
Staff who work standard hours will require to work 6 hours 35 minutes on Friday.
The above arrangements are an attempt to relieve some of the congestion on the roads at peak commuting times.
ATTENDANCE ON DAY RELEASE COURSE 1992/93

STATUTORY SICK PAY
The much-publicised Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) Scheme became effective from 6 April 1983.
Details of the SSP Scheme and how it will affect your pay in the event of sickness absence are given in Part I of the Guidance Notes, attached.
Allied to the introduction of SSP are changes in the notification and certification procedures.
These procedures have been agreed nationally and you are urged to read them carefully.
Failure to observe them may result in the withdrawal of occupational sick pay and/or statutory sick pay.
The procedures are detailed in Part II of the Guidance Notes.
If, after reading this Circular, you still have questions about the operation of SSP and/or the new notification/certification procedures, please do not hesitate to contact Mrs Diana Morrison (Ext 2733) or Ms Marlyn Minto (Ext 2734).
Staff in the Department of Manpower Services may contact Mr David Mackay (Ext 2795).
SICKNESS ON PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
Agreement has been reached at national level that where an APT & c member of staff is sick on a public holiday he/she is entitled to a day off in lieu.
STATUTORY SICK PAY (SSP)
GUIDANCE NOTES
PART I — DETAILS OF THE SSP SCHEME
1.
Introduction
From 6 April 1983 employers will be responsible for paying Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) to all employees for a maximum period of 8 weeks in a tax year.
SSP will replace the employee's entitlement to State sickness benefit, which will not be payable as long as there is an entitlement to SSP.
2.
Who are covered by the Scheme?
Basically, all employees are covered by the Scheme if they are sick for 4 or more days in a row.
The main exceptions to the rule are employees who:
— are over State pension age (60 for women, 65 for men) on the first day of sickness
— have average weekly earnings less than (currently) £32.50 a week
— go sick within 57 days of a previous claim for certain State benefits such as Sickness Benefit or Maternity Allowance
— have reached maximum entitlement to SSP
Other exclusions will be notified to individuals when the circumstances arise.
If you are sick and are in one of the excluded groups, you will be advised so that you can claim State Sickness Benefit instead.
3.
Qualifying Conditions for SSP
There are 2 qualifying conditions attached to entitlement to SSP.
Entitlement to SSP arises only:—
(1)
during a Period of Incapacity for Work (PIW)
(2)
on a Qualifying Day
These conditions are examined separately.
Period of Incapacity for Work (PIW)
A Period of Incapacity for Work (PIW) is formed when there is a spell of 4 or more consecutive days of sickness.
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays are counted.
If there are less than 4 days of sickness in a row there is no PIW and there is no SSP involvement.
Any two PIWs separated by not more than 14 calendar days will be linked and treated as one PIW.
Qualifying Days
SSP is paid only on Qualifying Days.
The Qualifying Days for APT & c Staff are:—
— all seven days, Sunday to Saturday in each calendar week for full-time employees; and
— the days in the week on which the employee is rostered to work, for part-time employees working less than 5 days a week.
SSP will not be payable for the first 3 Qualifying Days in any PIW; these are the waiting days.
If 3 waiting days have been served in a PIW no waiting days will be served in a later linked PIW.
If less than 3 waiting days have been served in a PIW only the balance of waiting days will remain to be served in a later linked PIW.
4.
Rates of SSP
There are 3 rates of SSP, depending on your average weekly earnings:—
SSP is a flat rate and does not take account of any dependants.
SSP can only be paid in respect of Qualifying Days.
The daily rate is the appropriate weekly rate divided by the number of qualifying days in the week.
5.
Payment of SSP
SSP will be paid with normal salary.
It is subject to tax, superannuation and national insurance deductions — unlike State Sickness Benefit.
If you are entitled to a sickness allowance under the occupational sick pay scheme, SSP is paid as part of that sickness allowance.
During the waiting days your pay will consist of the sickness allowance.
On those days SSP is due your pay will consist of SSP and the sickness allowance.
In both cases your gross pay will be as normal, unless you have exhausted the full sickness allowance.
SSP will appear on your pay advice under Code 601.
6.
No Entitlement to SSP
If you are excluded from SSP once a PIW has been formed (i.e. you have been sick for 4 days in a row) the Administrative Officer (Personnel), Regional Secretary's Department, will send you an ‘exclusion form’ SSP1(E).
The exclusion form tells you and the DHSS why SSP is not payable, and provides you with a claim form for State Sickness Benefit.
You should complete the claim form and send it direct to your local DHSS Office.
7.
Transfer to State Sickness Benefit
If your sickness continues after the employer's SSP liability ends, you will be able to claim State Sickness Benefit.
The Administrative Officer (Personnel) will send you a ‘transfer form’, SSP1(T).
You should complete the claim form and send it direct to your local DHSS Office.
Where the Administrative Officer (Personnel) holds a doctor's statement covering days beyond the last day for which SSP is due, it will be sent to you together with the ‘transfer form’.
Married women who pay the reduced rate national insurance contributions will receive the ‘transfer form’ even though they are not entitled to sickness benefit.
PART II — NOTIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES
You must fulfil all of the following requirements to be entitled to SSP (or sickness allowance under the occupational sick pay scheme) unless otherwise stated.
First Stage
If you fall sick, you or some other person acting on your behalf, must notify your Divisional or Section Head immediately.
A telephone call will serve for the purpose of notification.
‘Immediately’ is defined (at this stage) as the earliest possible time on the first working day of absence.
If this definition changes at a later date it will be notified to you.
If you are a shift worker and, under existing arrangements, you notify your absence before your shift is due to begin, you should continue to do so.
Second Stage
If the absence continues to a fourth day, at that time, you or some other person acting on your behalf, must notify the Divisional/Section Head of the continuing absence and whether the period of absence is likely to continue beyond the seventh day.
If this is likely, your Divisional/Section Head will arrange for the Administrative Officer (Personnel) to send you a self-certificate to cover the first seven days of your absence.
Third Stage
Where the absence extends to seven days or less you must, on return to work, complete a self-certificate.
The forms are available from your Divisional or Section Head who is responsible for ensuring that completed forms are returned to the Administrative Officer (Personnel).
A new Sickness Absence Certificate has been designed for use in sickness absence of seven days or less.
Fourth Stage
Where the absence extends beyond seven days, you must submit doctor's statements to cover the period of absence beyond the seventh day.
The first doctor's statement must be submitted on the eighth day along with the self-certificate to the Administrative Officer (Personnel).
You must also notify your Divisional/Section Head at intervals of no more than seven days of the position where the absence extends beyond seven days.
Days of Sickness
Please notify all days of sickness absence to your Divisional-Section Head, even if such days are non-working days.
For example, if your working week is Monday to Friday but you are sick Friday, Saturday and Sunday you must notify the whole absence.
Non-compliance with Procedures
If you fail to comply with the notification and certification procedures in respect of any day of sickness or any day of incapacity for work, entitlement in respect of that day to either SSP or sickness allowance shall cease.
This non-compliance clause is qualified as follows
(1)
The withdrawal of SSP or sickness allowance will apply where there is no acceptable reason for the failure to notify within the respective time limits.
In exceptional circumstances, your Head of Department will not apply the withdrawal clause if there is a reasonable explanation for failure to notify.
(2)
Where notification is given at the first stage, but not in accordance with the procedures laid down for the first stage, you shall not be disentitled to SSP for that day for that reason only.
You shall, however, not become entitled to sickness allowance until the following day if the period of absence continues.
(3)
Where further notification is not given on the fourth day in accordance with the procedures laid down for the second stage, you shall not be disentitled to SSP from the fourth day of absence for that reason only.
You shall, however, not again become entitled to sickness allowance until the day on which further notification is received.
(4)
You shall continue to be disentitled until the day of sickness or day of incapacity for work on which you satisfy the requirements of the notification and certification procedures.
No Entitlement to SSP
Where there is no entitlement to SSP the above notification and certification procedures must still be followed.
Where you are claiming State Sickness Benefit, you will receive along with your DHSS giro cheque Form BS12 which shows your weekly entitlement to sickness benefit.
The form should be forwarded to the Administrative Officer (Personnel), Regional Secretary's Department, Room 3.2.
Regional Headquarters immediately it is received from the DHSS.
REGIONAL CALENDAR 1992
The production of the Regional Council's standard calendar for 1992 is now in hand.
The design and layout is to be similar to last year's calendar.
The cost of these calendars is significantly less than that obtainable from other sources and will be approximately 8p per calendar.
Please let me know the numbers required by your Department by Monday 30 September 1991.
WINDOW CLEANING AND OFFICE CLEANING
I spoke to Colin Campbell on 29 April 1991 regarding the above items.
The details are:
(a)
Window Cleaning
The office windows were cleaned over the weekend.
The job appears to have been reasonably well done.
However, on Monday morning, 29 April 1991, I discovered that the seating in the office (Room 3.14) had been rearranged and that cigarette ash was over the meeting table and one of the chairs.
It may only be coincidence that the window cleaners were around last weekend when this incident occurred.
I have no evidence to prove who was in the office.
I would be glad if you could investigate this matter and advise contractors, and others who may have access to this accommodation, of their obligation when undertaking work.
(b)
Office Cleaning
I have received a complaint regarding the general office cleaning service.
It appears that the standard of cleaning service provided in the accommodation used by the Medical Adviser and his staff could be improved upon.
A similar situation has arisen in room 3.14.
The waste buckets are regularly emptied, but otherwise my staff and I have some difficulty in establishing exactly what else has been included within the  cleaner's daily routine.
For example, the cigarette ash referred to above remains in place some 24 hours after being discovered!
I would be glad if you could deal with the above in terms of your role as contact with DSO staff.
FLEXITIME ADJUSTMENTS
As we are now reaching the Summer holiday period the adjustments to flexitime will be increasing due to staff applying for annual leave, flexi holidays and extended time away from work.
It is essential, therefore, that all adjustments covering annual leave during this period are received in the Admin — Personnel Section (Room 3.20) in advance.
This will ensure that flexi records are accurate and up to date.
If adjustments are late at the end of an accounting period they have to be corrected manually causing the work involved in administering the system to increase making it very time consuming for the clerical staff.
To alleviate this situation adjustments for week 4 of any period must be in by 10.00 am on the Tuesday of week 1.
We would appreciate your help with the above by ensuring that any adjustments for your staff reach us timeously.
TRANSFER OF CLEANING AND CATERING STAFF
The Regional Secretary's Department are dealing with the transfer from payroll 51 to payroll 57 and 501, of some of the DS0 Cleaning and Catering staff.
We are experiencing difficulty in processing these new appointments due to lack of information.
It would be greatly appreciated if your section could send the following details for all staff being transferred by the DSO, Sickness Records, Pension Transfer, and Reckonable Service.
The list below names employees that are at present being transferred and whose details are required as soon as possible.

Should you have any queries on the above please contact Miss S A Middlemiss.
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
FESTIVE SEASON — WORKPLACE CLOSURES
I refer to my memorandum dated 19 September 1990 which informed you that the Personnel Committee, at its meeting on 11 September 1990, decided not to agree to a closure of Regional Council workplaces during the 1990/91 festive season.
You will recall that the background to the decision was previous arrangements whereby closures of certain departments had taken place on days during the festive season to avoid the opening and heating of buildings for one or two days in a week with a large number of staff members taking annual leave on these days.
It was understood, however, that the Personnel Committee decision was intended to ensure that departments were open to members of the public rather than all workplaces.
Consequently, a number of workplaces were closed, subject to the following criteria:—
(a)
consideration by the Head of Department that a (workplace) closure is possible;
(b)
agreement with the Staff Representatives locally;
(c)
the exigencies of the service; and
(d)
no additional leave whatsoever being granted to employees to effect a closure.
The Chief Executive's Management Group have agreed that the same approach should be adopted for the festive season 1991/92.
It is agreed, therefore, that departments will remain open during the festive period but that, subject to the criteria set out in (a) to (d) inclusive above, a number of workplaces could be closed with a view to reducing property costs and improving the efficiency of staff working time.
As a result of the above decision and in respect of criterion (a) above, it is a matter for the Head of Department to consider if a workplace closure is desirable and, if so, to take account of the terms of this memorandum in seeking to effect the closure.
UK's Response to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development
The Consumer Education Unit takes action, within schools and the wider community, to raise awareness of the environmental impact of consumer choices and over-consumption.
Through the provision of information and practical training opportunities it encourages a positive and practical approach to environmental issues.
During the recent Festival of the Environment the unit participated in Community Education's Environmental Exploratorium.
Over 400 school children took part in the mock shopping experience.
The children were provided with facts regarding, for example, packaging and recycling opportunities and then used the information to make ‘hands on’ choices from a range of consumer goods.
Comment:
It is important to ensure that legitimate public interest in environmental issues is properly met by access to reliable information and advice.
In particular the issue of over-consumption needs to be brought to the fore and consumers should be made aware of the role they have to play.
Initiatives such as those provided by the Consumer Education Unit can have a useful influence on attitudes and habits within the community as a whole and should be considered for inclusion in sustainability plans.
Energy education is currently being undertaken by a number of agencies with specific expertise.
In particular an urban aid project known as HEAT (Home Energy Action Team) is active in Lothian.
ASSISTANT COMMITTEE SECRETARY A PROFILE
starts work in the Education/Social Work part of the Committee Division on 5 July.
Aged 32, he comes to Lothian with wide experience in Committee administration, having previously worked for Falkirk, East Lothian, and Strathkelvin District Councils.
He spent almost 4 years at Strathkelvin before joining the Regional Council.
His hobbies include tennis, golf, running, and writing short stories.
was educated in Edinburgh, and currently stays in the City.
He is, however looking to improve his environment by joining most of his immediate colleagues in West Lothian!
I have prepared an Induction Programme for , and a copy is attached for those involved.
will initially be involved in a range of Education Sub -Committees; the Fire Board, and some Joint Planning and Children's Panel work.
Dear Councillor
DRAFT STRUCTURE PLAN REVIEW
Please find enclosed a copy of the draft document of the reviewed Lothian Region Structure Plan.
This will be the subject of a presentation, of which you have already been notified, in the Lothian Regional Chambers, Parliament Square, Edinburgh on Thursday 8 April 1993 at 11.30am.
The Draft Structure Plan document will also be considered at the following meetings:—
Special meeting of the Planning and Development Committee 15 April 1993
Policy and Resources Committee 20 April 1993
Regional Council 28 April 1993
The agenda for these meetings will be issued in due course and members are asked to retain their copy of the Draft Structure Plan to take to these meetings, as appropriate.
Certain aspects of the Draft Structure Plan will also be considered by Services Committees during May and June and the Draft Structure Plan document would also be useful for these meetings.
Yours sincerely
LOTHIAN REGIONAL COUNCIL BY-ELECTION — 16 SEPTEMBER 1993 NO 42 BONNYRIGG/NEWTONGRANGE ELECTORAL DIVISION
I refer to our recent telephone conversation concerning the above.
I confirm that, as agreed, I have arranged for your Mr R Simpson to deal with any matters arising in connection with the above during my absence on leave from 7–21 August 1993.
Full instructions and documentation have been given to him.
Notice of Election is due to be published on 12 August 1993 with the nomination period commencing on Wednesday, 13 August 1993 and closing at 4.00 pm on Tuesday, 24 August 1993.
Room 4.17 has been nominated as the place for the delivery of nominations and withdrawals.
Clearly, it is essential that throughout the nomination period Room 4.17 is manned continuously during normal office hours.
I have so advised Mr Simpson but it might be helpful if you could reinforce the point.
Many thanks for your co-operation and assistance.
COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
We have now received a report from Computer Services on a Committee Management System.
 This note is to give you a quick update — the report still has to go to the Computer Needs Group.
Computer Services are recommending working towards a Council-wide office automation (OA) network in three phases.
The report is not complete; it does not give a full specification nor costs.
These are to come.
Phase 1
Linking the Committee Division and Typing Services.
Buying more PC's for the Committee Division.
Standardising on Words for Windows.
Putting in necessary cabling and linking box.
Providing a shared data base.
Possible back record conversion.
We have no clear idea of timetabling or costs.
But from what is available it looks as though typing Services will be rid of Wang by the end of September and we could be linked by December (this does seem optimistic).
We have to decide on whether the system is what we want and how many individual PC's there should be.
A demonstration is being arranged and our initial examination indicates we can contain this phase within the existing budgets.
By and large Alex and I think these developments are likely to give tangible gains and could well become a priority for implementation.
Phase 2
Identify and connect a suitable pilot department.
Extend to other departments.
Phase 3
Implement OA system in the Regional Chambers for elected members and public using X.25 Wide Area Network.
Connect us to the X.25.
Phases 2 and 3 seem overly ambitious given the present circumstances.
What I want to ensure is that Computer Services aspirations for Phases 2 and 3 do not cause unnecessary delay or additional cost to an improvement in the Committee Division's use of computers.
TRAVELLING AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCES
I refer to my memorandum dated 31 March 1993 in the above regard, to which all departments have now responded.
Only 3 departments grant travelling expenses, and only 2 departments grant subsistence allowances, to employees who voluntarily work overtime at the contractual workplace and receive payment therefor.
The departments in question have been informed, in writing, to cease making payments in the above circumstances, and have been offered assistance from the Employee Relations Section during the consultation process.
TRANSPORT IN LOTHIAN STRATEGIC PLAN: 1993–1996
Following the discussion at the Chief Executive's Management Group, I have now had an opportunity of reviewing the draft of the above document.
I suggest that, in order to avoid confusion with other ‘strategic’ documents on transport, the title is changed to ‘Corporate Plan’.
This better reflects the corporate nature of transport, which involves not only Planning and Highways but also the Police, Education and Social Work.
The Corporate Plan for Transport would then be identified with the Regional Council rather than with individual departments.
As a next step, I am circulating this to the other departments and inviting their views and comments.
I would then propose to add it to the agenda of the Transport Working Group before bringing it back to the Chief Executive's Management Group.
NORTH BERWICK STATION CAR PARK
I am writing in the light of a meeting with ScotRail on 3 November, which was attended by Stuart Smith from the LDU, and a subsequent telephone conversation between Brian Sharkie and yourself.
We had previously indicated to you that, because of escalating cost estimates, we might not be able to proceed with the North Berwick station car park project in the near future.
However ScotRail have now identified funds which would enable them to contribute a much larger sum than they had previously promised, provided the money can go through their accounts in the current financial year.
They have advised that, in order to achieve this, they must receive their invoice before 5 March 1993 ‘with major works deemed to be complete.’
I am most keen to take advantage of this offer, which is unlikely to be available in 1993/94, given the dire state of BR's overall financial position.
Notwithstanding the ScotRail money, the LRC contribution will still be a lot higher than has so far been authorised, and I will need to report back to Committee.
I do not expect any difficulty in getting approval for the larger sum, and can do that at the same time as tenders are to hand for acceptance, but it will remain important to contain the total project cost as far as possible.
The key meeting of the Transportation Committee would appear to be Monday 8 February.
I hope that, given the work done so far to design and cost the scheme, you can have tenders to hand by then on the basis that construction would begin on site very soon after a decision at that meeting.
I understand that an essential site survey has not yet been undertaken, and would ask that this be set in hand immediately.
There is a complication concerning ownership of the site, since a strip belongs to the Fire Board.
However I am pursuing that with the Property Services Department, who act for both the Council and the Board, and they have given authority for us to enter the land for the purpose of drilling bore-holes etc.
We also have that authority from  of ScotRail in respect of their site.
All costs may be charged to code 593000 — 67950.
ScotRail have specifically asked me to draw to the attention of all concerned that:
‘during construction works Health and Safety aspects of construction teams will be the responsibility of Lothian Regional Council and staff must be advised that they must not:
a)
go on or about the running railway
b)
place themselves or any materials within nine feet of the running railway or overhead line equipment.
and during construction disruption must be kept to a minimum.’
I would be grateful for your written confirmation as soon as possible that LDU will be able to progress the project at this pace.
Please let me know if you think that an early meeting is necessary to clarify details.
COUNCIL TAX BILLING
I am pleased to be able to confirm that the setting up of Council Tax liabilities for individual properties is now complete within the computer software, with the exception of a few properties where the rebate entitlement has still not to be finally resolved.
Details of the amounts due to be billed and the properties concerned are set out on the attached sheet for your information.
At the present time the Council Tax Demands and payment voucher books are being printed, they will start to be issued by the Post Office from 20 April onwards over a period of about one week.
I am preparing a report for the next Finance Committee on Council Tax Billing and will forward this for your agreement as soon as possible.
COUNCIL TAX — NEWSROUND
I have received your draft article to be printed in ‘Newsround’ and before making any comments perhaps the leaflet which Exchequer Division have just produced will help in your task.
Copies of the leaflet are being distributed to members today and will be available at public counters at Headquarters and Chesser House.
It has been produced because of the telephone enquiries we are now receiving following publicity in the national press.
In your third paragraph note that the resident owner/occupier or tenant will be the person liable for payment.
There will again be Joint and Several liability as there was in Community Charge.
Again the leaflet will be helpful in that it is the Regional Assessor who determines the band for the property.
If you require any further help please contact me.
Thank you.
COUNCIL TAX WATER CONNECTIONS
I refer to our telephone conversation recently regarding the number of properties within each Council Tax band connected to the mains water supply.
This information has been taken from the Advance Data Capture file and whilst it is not 100% correct I hope it will suffice for your purposes.
You will note in the Appendix that there is still a figure of 1,706 properties to be banded together with 3,618 which either have an indicator showing them to be metered supply or with no connection to the public water supply.
If you need any further information please let me know.
APPENDIX
COUNCIL TAX/COMMUNITY CHARGE RETURNS
I refer to your fax of 16 February 1993 concerning the return you have received for completion from the Local Government Chronicle.
I enclose herewith a photocopy of my suggested replies to the various categories, with the exception of ‘What is your planned use of reserves?’ and ‘What is your Regional charge on band D of the Council Tax?’, both of which I will leave for you to insert at the appropriate time.
Whilst I have said 2 years as the expected time to be collecting Community Charge I think this should be qualified with 2 years plus, with income being received for some considerable time thereafter especially through Sheriff Officers.
With regards to the expected Community Charge arrears at 1 April 1993, I have provided my best estimate.
This is the total arrears for the 4 years of Community Charge and includes the Region, Districts and Water Charge.
The collection fund surplus or shortfall is not relevant to Scottish authorities but would suggest we inform the Local Government Chronicle of the 13% bad debts provision made by Lothian Regional Council generally.
If you wish to discuss any of these items any further please give me a ring.
Dear John
COUNCIL TAX PUBLICITY
I have had discussions with Alex Stein and Councillor Begg about publicity on the council Tax.
Media Action who organise information type campaigns using principally Radio Forth and the Evening News have drafted proposals for a possible ‘week of information’.
I enclose details and as you will see their approach is based on the informal as well as the informative.
Can you let me know if you have any interest in such a promotion which would be best organised around the time when the bills are going out.
Give me a ring if you want to discuss the proposal.
If not are not interested in Media Action, could you let me know what other kind of publicity you may require over the next four to six weeks.
Yours sincerely
COUNCIL TAX PUBLICITY
I refer to your letter of 11 March 1993 concerning the above and the use of Media Action to organise an information type campaign over a period of possibly one week.
Alex Stein has already been in touch with you, however I would formally confirm that we would be interested in such a publicity campaign for Council Tax at about the time bills are being issued in April.
It would be helpful if we can have an early meeting to discuss this matter in more detail and to begin planning the publicity campaign in earnest.
I understand Fife Regional Council are also considering a publicity campaign using Radio Forth.
It has been suggested that we mount a joint campaign and share the costs.
I would be grateful if this could be explored further.
Proposal by Media Action for radio campaign to explain and raise awareness of the Council Tax
CSV Media Action
Background
What is Media Action?
Media Action, formerly known as Forth Action, is the social action broadcasting team attached to the two Radio Forth group stations, Max-Am and RFM.
Over the past 12 years, Media Action has broadcast on a wide range of health issues.
These campaigns such as mental health, alcohol abuse, health and fitness, eating disorders and HIV/AIDS.
The aims of our broadcasting
1/
To increase awareness of social issues, allowing people to gain access to relevant services.
This is achieved by encouraging people to becoming actively involved in the broadcasting sending out information packs and providing off-air counselling.
2/
To tackle attitudes and prejudices.
Recently our campaign on mental health problems showed that these people can recover in much the same way as people who have physical health problems.
In conjunction with our radio broadcasts, we often run the campaign in the local press and Evening News.
Our links with the press are strong and we provide copy ready material and photographs under the banner of Media Action.
Our other work includes press and publicity training for community groups and charitable organisations.
One new development in our educational work has been with schools and community organisations.
The most recent of these was a campaign in which we visited schools, producing tapes with the children on subjects such as drugs, smoking and the environment.
What the radio campaign will achieve:
Through a week long campaign on both Max-Am and RFM stations it is possible to reach a large audience in the Lothians.
This will enable the Region Council to increase awareness of the Council Tax, the way it works and how people pay.
This could be coordinated with a campaign in the community press with us supplying copy ready material written under the banner of Media Action which is well known to both the newspapers and their readers.
Topics to be tackled:
When the campaign is broadcast everyone will be sitting with a council tax bill in their hand therefore the issue is very immediate.
It's important to start the campaign off with an introduction to the Council Tax followed by more specialised themes such as discounts.
It is also important to stress the difference between the new Council Tax and the old Community Charge so people are aware how little chance there is of avoiding payment.

Case Studies
Ways of tackling the council tax on air:
The broadcasts should not to be crammed with masses of information — key messages should be kept as simple as possible using humour, drama and celebrities to convey the basic facts.
Examples: Humorous and dramatic dialogues between two people chatting about the tax, one totally ignorant and the other knowledgeable; question and answer sessions; vox pops with the public asking them what they know about the tax; case studies of people who are unsure if they are entitled to any discounts.
During the week long campaign our phone number will be broadcast on a daily basis promoting an information pack and telephone help-line between the hours of 2pm — 4 pm so that people can get instant answers to their problems.
The back up pack should perhaps contain the leaflet you sent to us.
We propose the following format for Forth RFM:
* To target the 15–30 age group, inform them about the Council Tax
* To reach our target audience through the use of appropriate language, music, humour and drama.
* Use our well established back up service of a confidential help line and information packs.
* A well known Radio Forth RFM presenter will head the campaign.
* The RFM format will be prerecorded inserts up 2 minutes, long broadcast 4 times a day inclusive at approximately 11.30am, 1.30pm, 3.30pm and one (time still to be confirmed) in the evening.
Included in these broadcasts will be interviews with experts, case studies, vox pops and humorous and dramatic pieces.
Proposed format for Max-Am:
* To inform the 35 year old plus age group of the council tax.
* A well known Max-AM presenter will head the campaign to extend the appeal to all age groups.
* The Max-AM format will be 3 × 2 minute prerecorded inserts broadcast Monday to Friday inclusive at approximately 11.10 am 1.25pm and 4.30pm and tailored to suit the audience of Max-AM.
* An appropriate backing track will be used to identify the broadcasts.
* A phone line service and information packs will be provided.
Costing:
This will include research, interviews, production of all on air material, articles written for community press and Evening News article.
All costs incurred and the distribution of the information packs.
We will be happy to discuss this with you further.
We would also have to discuss the  availability of regional council workers to man the helplines.
COUNCIL TAX — NOTIFICATION OF BANDING
I refer to your memorandum of 19 August 1992 to the Director of Finance concerning the notification of Valuation Bandings to individuals.
I confirm that it is intended to notify individual responsible persons of their Council Tax Banding as part of the canvas exercise in December 1992.
My department are already receiving enquiries from individuals concerning Council Tax, including the valuation of their property.
Once the Scottish Office commence their national publicity for Council Tax at the end of September I expect the number of enquiries, including enquiries about Banding, to increase dramatically.
I am therefore planning to set up a Council Tax enquiry line and a small team to deal with all enquiries.
I will be reporting on this to the next Finance Committee.
Once you have provided the Provisional Banding List on or before 1 December it has to be deposited at the Council's principal office and steps taken to give notice of this.
Notice that the Provisional Banding Lists are publicly available could be given in 3 main ways:
(a)
by notice/advertisement in the local press
(b)
by advising responsible persons of this in canvas documents, being issued in December 1992 in Lothian
(c)
by advising responsible persons of their individual banding as part of the canvas exercise
Given that the Provisional Banding List is publicly available and the likely level of enquiry in this regard I favour option (c) supplemented by advertisement in the local press.
This would give maximum publicity to the Lists, avoid individuals having to make special journeys to Council Offices to inspect the Lists and reduce the number of basic enquiries.
It has always been the intention to advise individuals that this is a Provisional Banding, that they will receive formal notification of their Banding with their Demand in April 1993 and that any enquiries/appeals about Banding cannot be dealt with until after 1 April 1993.
Whilst some Bandings may change between the Provisional List (1 December 1992) and the Final List (1 April 1993), it should be borne in mind that the Council Tax billing for 1993/94 will be done on the Provisional Banding List as the Final List will not be available in time.
This means that in most (almost all) cases the Provisional Banding notified in December 1992 will be the same as that notified on the Demand in April 1993.
As the canvas documents, including the notification of banding, will be issued by the Finance Department I would expect all the enquiries during December 1992 to April 1993, and probably after April 1993, to be directed at the Finance Department.
I have already stated that a small team is being established to deal with Council Tax enquiries following Scottish Office publicity.
This team will be extended as necessary and will be increased significantly once the canvas exercise commences.
I see no difficulty in this team dealing with valuation queries during this period.
In conclusion I believe it is in the best interests of the Council and the public to notify individual Bandings as part of the canvas exercise.
The public will be advised that it is provisional and no appeals can be considered until after 1 April 1993.
My department will deal with all enquiries resulting from the canvas, including those concerning banding.
I will ask the Director's secretary to convene a Council Tax Steering Group in the near future to discuss the various issues arising.
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT — A PROPOSAL
SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED:
Photocopying
Faxing
Opening/Sorting mail
Telephone Messages
Filing
Diary
Catering for Meetings
Travel Arrangements
In looking at the services to be provided, it is recognised that some duties require a more responsible level of staff than others.
It is suggested therefore that photocopying, faxing and catering for meetings, which require a minimum of training, are dealt with by members of the Typing Pool.
It is also recognised that having a single contact person within the Exchequer Division to deal with travel agents is good practice and therefore it is suggested that Carole Ann Johnston, Admin Assistant arrange all travel and overnight accommodation when required.
The responsibility for the remaining four services would then be split between Carole Ann and Susan Horler, Typing Pool Supervisor.
It is suggested, taking into account the positioning of the Senior Management offices that Susan provides these services for Mike Peterson and for John Diggory in the absence of his secretary.
Carole Ann would provide the same services for Alistair Nairn and Tom Ogilvie, Council Tax Managers.
Both Carole and Susan agree that the above proposal appears to them to be the most workable.
However, any farther suggestions are welcome.
CONFERENCES — ATTENDANCE OF MEMBERS
The General Purposes Committee on 3 June 1993 approved the attendance of members and officials at a number of forthcoming conferences.
(1)
Dry Stores for Spent Nuclear Fuel — Lancaster — 30 June 1993 — Chairman and Councillor Stephenson (or nominees)
(2)
Southern Africa —‘Making Hope a Reality’— London — 14/15 June 1993 — Councillor McCulloch (or nominee)
(3)
ITSA Annual Conference — Edinburgh 30 June — 2July 1993 — 2 Members of the Labour Group and I other member
(4)
NFZ Scotland AGM — Glasgow — 11 June 1993 — Councillor McCulloch (or nominee)
(5)
SAND AGM — Inverness -12 June 1993 — Councillor Herald and Regional Analyst (or nominee)
(6)
Scottish Committee for Local Authority Action against Apartheid — Hamilton — 18 June 1993 — Councillor McCulloch (or nominee)
I have enclosed conference details and appropriate booking forms in each case.
Please make the appropriate arrangements to reserve places.
COUNCIL TAX — PROPOSED STAFF STRUCTURES
I enclose herewith a copy of Management Service Unit's proposed staffing structure for Council Tax together with draft Job Descriptions for your interest.
I must point out that these proposals are only at draft stage and Trade Unions are being consulted regarding them.
Further meetings are to be held with MSU and NALGO later this week.
I shall update you with any changes which occur at a later date.
COUNCIL TAX ACCOMMODATION
I would refer to previous discussions and correspondence concerning additional accommodation requirements for Council Tax.
I had understood from previous meetings that additional accommodation requirements for the introduction of Council Tax would be provided by the use of vacant space within Warriston's Close, space recently vacated by Computer Services.
I confirm, in accordance with the Assistant Director's previous memorandum, that additional space is required in Warriston's Close from mid November onwards in order to deal with Council Tax data collection and computer preparation.
This requirement is likely to continue until March/April 1993.
It is difficult to envisage the numbers it would be necessary to accommodate during this period, however I would estimate a rough requirement to accommodate 30 to 40 staff, although this would have to be kept under review in the light of the public's response and changes required to known data.
Following this period it would be necessary to accommodate additional staff during 1993/94, probably to deal with Community Charge residual functions (particularly collection and recovery) where there would be insufficient space within Chesser House.
The staffing reports currently being submitted to Council incorporate a Community Charge residual team of some 70 staff and I understand that it is unlikely there will be space for this number within Chesser House for some time.
I would therefore require the available accommodation in Warriston's Close during 1993/94 to accommodate probably 50 plus staff for this purpose.
I was a little concerned when I heard rumours that this property was now being marketed for sale particularly given my requirements and our previous understanding in this regard.
I would be obliged therefore to receive your confirmation that Warriston's Close would be available for this purpose as a matter of urgency.
COUNCIL TAX STRUCTURE
For your information I enclose a copy of the completed Council Tax structure.
It is proposed that staff will move to their new positions within Council Tax with effect from 29 March 1993 and files, personal possessions etc will be moved the weekend prior to this date.
The Assistant Managers will continue to work where they are currently situated and this will give you an indication of where you will initially be working in the new structure.
However it should be noted that for audit purposes staff will be moved on a regular basis both within each section and between the 2 sections.
As regards any holidays which have already been booked for the period after 1 April 1993 these should be notified to your new supervisor to help avoid any problems occurring later in the year.
Any holidays not already booked should first of all be cleared with your new supervisor.
As part of the office moves the Control staff will be relocated to the east wing of the ‘doughnut’ where the Benefits staff are presently situated.
Information regarding the location of the Community Charge Residue Team and further details including staff to be temporarily seconded from the Council Tax structure to assist the Residue Team will follow in due course.
PORT EDGAR: LEASE OF STORE BP OIL GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY LIMITED
Thank you for your memo of 26 October 1992.
Termination of BP's lease is noted and Oliver Ludlow, Training Officer, who is currently Acting Manager since Mark Wakelin departed, has been informed.
He advises that while the unit backs onto our store, as a self-contained unit, it should continue to be available for let on the open market.
Any lease issued now should of course be on a short term basis, as Development Proposals in some shape or form are likely to be implemented.
A.T.C.O.
TRAINING SEMINAR: GLENROTHES, 15th JANUARY 1993
I refer to our conversation last week at which you kindly agreed, subject to the date being convenient, to speak on Bus Priority Measures and Traffic Management at an A.T.C.O.
Training Seminar.
The date of the seminar is 15th January 1993 and the location will be Fife House at Glenrothes.
The seminar is one of a series which is being arranged by the Association of Transport Co-ordinating Officers (A.T.C.O.) with two main objectives.
The first is to give an opportunity to staff in relatively junior positions in the transport co-ordinating units of Scottish Regions to learn more about the wider scene into which their job slots, and the second is to allow such people to meet informally with their opposite numbers in other Regions and, it is hoped, to realise that problems which they have to face in their work are not all that different from those experienced by others in different locations.
What we would be looking for from you is a talk of some 15–20 minutes duration outlining what can be done for public transport by traffic management techniques and perhaps illustrated by some Lothian examples, together with a willingness to answer any questions which may be put to you.
Your talk would be part of a morning session which would also include a presentation about bus stops and shelters and one about bus stations and termini; the latter would be followed by a visit to Glenrothes Bus Station.
I hope that you will feel able to do this for us and that the date will be convenient.
ERDF GRANTS AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT
As you are aware I have been exploring ways in which the Regional Council can try to encourage investment by the private sector in the provision of new industrial land and buildings.
The level of return which can be achieved, and in some respects the high degree of management required, are the main factors contributing to the lack of private sector involvement in industrial development.
If the Regional Council is able to reduce the element of risk and improve returns it may be possible to secure private sector finance for industrial projects.
From my recent discussions with Chris Harris in the European Liaison Unit I am lead to believe that private sector investment in qualifying projects is eligible for grant assistance from the EC, but that the grant cannot be paid to a private sector company direct.
The principal recipients are the Local Authorities and the LEC's, although there is some debate at present as to whether organisations such as British Coal should qualify for direct payment (for the moment I have assumed that will not be the case).
I have recently been involved in preliminary discussion with a private sector developer, and with British Coal, concerning two separate projects which could lead to the provision of serviced development land.
In each case expenditure on the project would qualify for EC grant assistance, and there would be significant private sector investment.
Any expenditure by the Regional Council would be from an identified Industrial Development Budget heading, and would be likely to form only a small proportion of the total project cost.
For example, if expenditure on site access and servicing totalling £500,000, were to be met in the proportion 80:20 (Private Sector: Local Authority), an EC grant of up to £250,000 could be received by the Local Authority.
If it were possible, in some way, for the benefit of the grant assistance to be returned to the private sector partner, it would serve to secure their interest in the project by increasing their return.
My interest is therefore in how the grant assistance from the EC is to be treated by the Council.
The Capital Plan for next year appears to treat it in the same way as capital receipts from sales, with the total being pooled and divided between the various programmes.
There is obviously an argument here, as with capital receipts, for the grant to be returned to the spending programme.
I appreciate that this is a recurring argument, and that, ultimately, grants on the Council's own expenditure may be treated this way.
I would hope, however, that any grant received by the Council in respect of a private sector partners investment in a joint project could be treated differently.
In order to secure a private sector  partner's involvement there would probably have to be a preemption on the grant received, so that it could be reinvested in the project.
For example initial expenditure by both partners could be on a first phase of access and servicing, with the grant receivable by virtue of that expenditure reinvested in a second phase, and so one.
You indicated that there is currently no Council policy on the treatment of EC grant received, and that you do not anticipate the matter being resolved until February or March '93.
As I am anxious to progress discussions on the two projects as soon as possible, and may be in a position to report to the Economic Development Committee before then, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the above at your earliest opportunity.
If some principles can be agreed I will be looking to introduce this concept into other potential projects I have in mind.
I know that Chris Harris is anxious to discuss the matter, and has been exploring various angles with the Scottish Officer and the Commission.
A copy of his recent paper to the  Chief Executive Management Group is enclosed.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Chief Executive's Management Group: Additionality of EC Capital Grants
Current Situation
1.
The Regional Council is engaged in drawing down Capital grant assistance under RECHAR and mainstream ERDF programmes.
Up until February this year, this was achieved through a retrospective grant claim procedure and did not entail additional spending for the Regional Council.
2.
Since Peter Lilley's announcement in February, it appears that the ERDF and RECHAR grant element of approved projects will come to the Regional Council as additional capital consents as and when the money is spent.
However, there has been very little guidance or information from the Scottish Office relating to the transitional arrangements for RECHAR and how the Regional Council can maximise potential additional capital consents in 1993–94.
The most recent correspondence is attached.
3.
As grant aid will come to the Council as additional capital consents, further interest charges will be incurred and so will reduce any net benefit to the capital budget.
There is also a suspicion that the Government may adjust local authority block allocations in the next financial year to take account of expected EC grant received.
Various groups, including MPs, COSLA and the European Parliament are gathering evidence that the government has deliberately misled the European Commission on ‘additionality’— see press article attached.
4.
Added to this, the Government's expressed aim to reduce public expenditure suggests there may be little or no overall boost to the Regional Council's capital budget.
The Council could end up in a net loss position as currently there is a non-alignment of EC Development programme priorities and Regional Council capital spending priorities.
5.
Without due consideration of both RECHAR and ERDF regulations for the 1993–94 financial year, the Council may lose out through the competitive grant application procedure.
Other Issues to be Addressed
6.
There is still no clear indication as to whether the additional capital consents will revert to the applicant service department's budget or will be subsumed into the overall Council budget.
7.
There are also a number of issues surrounding the local additionality of EC grant aid.
It is important to establish whether the additional consents need to be spent on RECHAR or ERDF eligible projects in Objective 2 eligible areas.
RECHAR
8.
This programme has been through the first round of application approvals which saw the Regional Council gain around £17,000 to capital and around £600,000 to revenue.
These approvals are the first to come forward under the transitional arrangements the Government set up to cover RECHAR in the 1992–93 financial year.
This programme has nearly been completed and is unlikely to provide any significant levels of grant aid in 1993.
Lothian Operational Programme (ERDF)
9.
The first round of applications eligible for additional consents will come forward in April 1993.
It should be noted that the programme will have been more than 50% spent by then (around £4m).
THE MIDLOTHIAN LOCAL PLAN: INFORMATION REQUEST FROM MIDLOTHIAN DISTRICT COUNCIL
I refer to my earlier memo in connection with the above informing you of Midlothian District Councils intention to prepare a district wide replacement plan.
The local plan will replace the existing local plans for Midlothian District.
To assist the preparation of the local plan you previously advised that the Regional Council has significant property interests in the Midlothian area.
You may wish to consider the following:
1
Are there Regional Council land/buildings surplus to requirements;
2
Specify any land requirements for the provision of new Regional Council facilities.
3
Any other information concerning Regional Council land and property which is relevant to the preparation of the local plan.
It would be appreciated if a reply could be forwarded to this department by Friday 18 December 1992.
If you are unable to meet this deadline please let me know as soon as possible.
SUBJECT: THE MIDLOTHIAN LOCAL PLAN
I refer to my earlier memo in connection with the above informing you of Midlothian District Councils intention to prepare a district wide replacement plan.
The local plan will replace the existing local plans for Midlothian.
The District Council has now commenced survey work for the local plan and is seeking information which would assist in the preparation of the district wide local plan.
Does the Landscape Development Unit's programme of land rehabilitation schemes have implications for land use planning in Midlothian?
It would be appreciated if a reply could be forwarded to this department by Friday 18 December 1992.
If you are unable to meet this deadline please let me know as soon as possible.
MEDIA ACTION WEEK — COUNCIL TAX
I refer to your memorandum of 13 May 1993 concerning the above and have set out below my comments on the recent campaign undertaken by Media Action.
In general I thought the campaign was well presented and dealt with by Media Action given the shortness of time they had to prepare the sketches and the associated scripts.
I am disappointed with the volume of calls resulting from the campaign and the number of fact packs which were issued.
Notwithstanding the low number of calls resulting from the campaign I would agree that individual taxpayers appreciated the information point which they could contact to deal with enquiries.
It would have been better if we had had a valuation number from the outset which may well have proved more satisfactory with regards to initial enquiries.
It is difficult to assess the long term benefit of such a campaign as individual cases now coming to light clearly heard some of the publicity which was beneficial to them at the time but did not result in them making a call at that particular time.
Therefore there is clearly some on-going benefit from such a campaign which cannot be measured by the number of enquiries received.
I think overall there was a definite public benefit from offering this type of information, although I would hope that we could have a longer lead in time with regards to any future campaign.
Please convey my appreciation to Media Action on how they handled the campaign in such a short period of time.
I met with Media Action to discuss the recent awareness week we had on the Council Tax and I attach my notes for your interest.
I also attach the full text of the scripts and have a copy of the tape pieces.
I would appreciate any comments you want to make about the campaign and Media Action and your final evaluation of the programme.

PRODUCT:
Media Action Awareness Week 26 April
CONTACT:
John Diggory/Alex Stein
Notes by Susan Whiteford
Background
The campaign took place over a week beginning on Monday 26 April.
The timing was very appropriate because the majority of Council Tax bills had gone out.
An Analysis of the week
Media Action took 300 calls during the week and issued 200 fact packs.
Some three weeks later they are still responding to queries and will continue to send out packs.
In their experience this is a favourable response to a campaign like this.
The general impression from the media action people who answered the telephones is that people who called appreciated the information point and had no objections to being asked to call another number to deal with enquiries about bills.
A member of staff from Finance contacted the team concerned that her name was being given out on the radio.
We should have made it clear to the Media Action team not to refer callers to named staff.
Of course names were not broadcast and this was stopped as soon as the call was received.
The caller also was extremely annoyed that calls relating to valuation matters were being passed to her but Media Action had been given no alternative numbers to filter these calls to.
I felt, and this was shared by the media action people, that, apart from one sketch, the dialogue between the actors did not help to get the message across although did provide a contrast to the ‘voices of authority’ Councillor Begg and the DJ voiceover.
These were the two main sources of information.
I made the point that the sketches sounded amateurish and media action agreed that in future, with a topic as ‘serious’ as this, they would opt for professional actors.
Another point for any future work with media action is the timetable to approve scripts.
The timetable we had to work to meant  there was little opportunity to do anything with the draft scripts except change factual errors.
Conclusion
I felt there was public benefit from offering this type of information by radio and I have asked Media Action to let us have the  enquirers' addresses so that we can get a geographical appreciation of where the calls came from (one or two came from Fife)

This week the Action Team are going to be getting to grips with the Council Tax which came into effect from the 1st of April this year and affects us all.
 Councillor Begg explains more about what services this new tax pays for…
David Begg…
People will get all the education services, nursery, primary and secondary, that accounts for half of Lothian Regions expenditure.
We've also got social work services, home help, meals on wheels, children's homes and old peoples homes.
We've also got the Police and Fire service as well and water and drainage which is still provided by local authorities.
So a wide range of services are provided.
DJ…

Fiona; Yeh, he's absolutely  gorgeous.
I couldn't believe it when he said he'd take the room.
Wendy; Actually we're pretty lucky to have him, not only because he's a whole hunk of a man but also because we're all full time students which means that we don't have to pay this new Council tax.
Fiona; Yeh I've heard about this Council Tax, so then it's true if you're all students living together then you don't have to pay? great!!
Wendy:(butting in still occupied with thought of new flat mate.)
You'll never guess what he does at University Fiona wait for it…he's studying to be  Astrophysicist .
Fiona; OOOh he could read my stars any day.
In fact, I think I'll just see if he needs any help unpacking…ok Wendy.
(sound of Fiona leaving the room)

Supermarket BOB and JIM Shopping
Sound of piped music in background.
BOB; Honestly 36 pence for a tin of grapefruit what's the world coming to.
JIM; Outrageous I know, look over here Bob have you ever seen the like.
Starfruit what on earth would you do with that?
BOB; Well it's not so much what you can do with it, it's whether you can afford it!
You know with this new tax coming in and me on my own.
JIM; Well actually you're better off.
BOB; What are you talking about, have you had another row with Sue?
JIM; No silly I'm talking about that Council Tax you know that people living on their own are entitled to 25% off the bills.
BOB Hey well that can't be bad.
Pop a couple of starfruit in my trolley, I'm splashing out.
David Begg…
The main discount is the single occupant discount which will entitle you to 25% off your bills.
Anyone living on their own will get this reduction.
DJ…
The Council Tax Helpline is here to help sort out any of your queries.
Why not make the most of it and call the Action Team, they'll put you in touch with the person responsible for your area call them now on 031-557-3194 during office hours.

Two old age pensioners waiting for a bus.
A; Oh for heavens sake where the heck is this bus honestly it's about as rare as seeing a three legged duck walking along the High Street with a shopping trolley.
B; Oh Agnes what a load of nonsense you speak.
Anyway talking of nonsense you should've seen the bill I was sent for my council tax it was quite pricey.
A Well I phoned this help line about the council tax and they were really helpful my bill was a lot cheaper than the original estimate, maybe you should give them a call?
B You must have been dreaming
A Well what's that coming towards us then
B I don't believe it it's a three legged duck complete with tartan shopper.
Duck Quack Quack!
David Begg…
The big improvement with the council tax is that we've gone back to the old system which is 100% rebates for those classified on low income.
DJ…
The council tax helpline is not a figment of Agnes's imagination it's there to help you get the benefits you're entitled to.
So if you have any queries call the Action Team on 031-557-3194 during office hours and they will put you in touch with the person responsible for your area.
Council Tax
Bands
Bob; Hiya George how are you doing?
George; Oh hi there Bob, how's life?
Bob; Not bad, not bad I've been sorting out my council tax
George; So you'll know what band you're house is in then
Bob; Yeh, It's in band D which means that my house comes between 45 and 58,000,
George; Oh right
Bob; I got a leaflet through the post the other day, it explains  everything and if you have any queries you can call the Helpline.
George; I wonder what band I'm in?
My flat can't be worth more than 20,000 do you know what band that'll be?
Bob; No, sorry I don't but it's really easy to find out just call the helpline and they'll be able to tell you exactly what band your flat is in and what discounts your eligible to.
David Begg…
The Council Tax is primarily a property tax.
We have a banding system so there's eight different bands depending on your property.
The new council tax has a single occupancy discount so if there's only one individual in the  household they'll get 25% off bills.
DJ…
Your bill will tell you what band you're in so if you think you're entitled to any discounts and these aren't shown on your bill, just pick up the phone and call the Action Team they'll put you through to someone who knows exactly what street you live in and what tax you should pay.
So call the Action Team now on 031 557 3194 during office hours.
COUNCIL TAX — COLLECTIONS/RECOVERY
The implementation of Council Tax has gone reasonably successfully to date and we have managed to process the first stage of recovery, that is Reminders, at the end of May 1993.
On 9 June 1993 92,658 Reminders will be issued to those people who did not pay their May instalment.
This will require those taxpayers to bring their instalments up to date within 7 days otherwise they will lose the right to pay by instalments.
There is a considerable backlog of work to process with regards to Council Tax.
Particular outstanding work is dealing with changes to the Community Charge Register which have to be reflected in the Council Tax liabilities, approximately 30,000 changes were to be processed in this area.
Another significant area of outstanding work is late benefit applications which total over 30,000 at the present time although some of these are speculative and some also apply to Community Charge as well as Council Tax.
Wherever possible staff have suspended Reminders on known outstanding cases and therefore in most instances Reminders will not be issued to taxpayers where benefits or other changes are currently being processed or awaiting processing.
It has not been possible to present a report to this month's Finance Committee due to the timing of the recovery action and the Committee date.
I will endeavour to present a Council Tax update report on 21 July.
In the meantime I will continue to keep you advised of progress.
CONTROL OF SMOKING AT WORK
I refer to your memorandum of 26 October 1992 concerning the end of the 3 month adjustment period following the introduction of smoking restrictions at Regional Headquarters and Regional Chambers.
I have been attempting to apply the smoking at work restrictions imposed at Regional Headquarters and Regional Chambers at Chesser House with limited success.
To date we have been permitting an additional smoking break in the morning and again in the afternoon for smokers within the office as part of the agreement to have no smoking throughout the main parts of Chesser House.
I have attempted to terminate the additional smoking breaks and to bring Chesser House into line with Regional Headquarters and Regional Chambers, and where necessary have special arrangements for individuals.
This has met with considerable resistance from the staff who have pointed out that the smoking restrictions at Chesser House are merely a voluntary agreement and are not Council policy in the same way as restrictions at Regional Headquarters and Regional Chambers.
I would be pleased if you could now take on board the extension of formal smoking at work restrictions as applied at Regional Headquarters and Regional Chambers to apply to Chesser House and for this to be formally agreed by the Council.
If you wish to discuss this matter further please do not hesitate to contact me.
Following our meeting before your recent illness, I appreciate your concern that sufficient staff resources are devoted to the Millerhill Inquiry — nevertheless, it is imperative that the football stadia committee timetable is met.
Martin will need to press ahead with the new football stadia report.
I will try to take as much pressure off him as possible with procedural matters and meetings related to member consideration of the report.
Similarly, you will need to take as much inquiry pressure off him as possible, including written observations, arrangements, establishing principles of evidence — and presenting some evidence, if appropriate.
I appreciate you will need to review your team workload:
a
if some items (such as PHRP and landscape advice to highways) can be deferred, discuss with me — I will then inform other Divisions/ departments as necessary;
b
if some planning application consultations are delayed, this should be the result of a conscious decision, discussed with me — you will need to keep the team paperwork moving up to and during the inquiry.
Items must not be left.
Please discuss the conclusions of your review at the end of our discussion of the draft committee reports next Wednesday morning (25th).
I would also like then the information in relation to the ‘Public Inquiry’ head of the budget that I have requested a number of times previously — amount spent, individual commitments made but not yet received, likely costs in relation to Millerhill.
DRAFT ELIBURN NORTH WEST STAGE ‘A'
Livingston Development Corporation have issued revised land use and transportation proposals for the Eliburn North West area of the New Town.
It is proposed to submit these proposals to the Scottish Office for approval under Section 6(i) of the New Town (Scotland) Act 1988.
The Development Corporation require a response by 15 January 1992 at the latest.
To enable me to prepare a Committee Report for Planning and Development Committee on 14 January 1993, I would appreciate a response on this matter by Monday, 4 January 1993, if not sooner.
I look forward to hearing from you.
BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS OF CURRENT ENGLISH
The British National Corpus of Current English is a project to compile a national treasury of the English language to be used for research.
Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd are in charge of part of the project — they have to gather 5 million words of unpublished written material.
They have received the support of the private sector and they are now requesting material from the Regional Council.
They would like almost any kind of written communication (letters, reports, minutes, ‘style’ correspondence etc.) provided it is written on behalf of the Council (i.e. it is not incoming mail) and provided it is relatively modern (1975 or later).
I have agreed to help them with this very worthwhile project and I am about to send them 1 or 2 large envelopes of material.
They have asked that we give them a similar quantity from each department.
(I understand that the Director of Social Work is already making suitable arrangements).
Please send this direct within the next 3 weeks to the undernoted address.
They have guaranteed to maintain confidentiality (they do not keep names and addresses) but perhaps the safest way to do this is to edit the material to be given by your department or exclude any material that is remotely confidential.
A copy of the background correspondence is attached for your information along with a form giving permission to use the material.
Thank you for a very clear and helpful presentation to the Departmental Seminar.
Staff were asked to channel views through their Divisional rep — my views are set out below:
1
The consultation paper and video are designed to mean all things to all men — we cannot assume that points we support will be retained.
The Departmental submission should specifically support key points, eg
a
the value of Structure Plans ‘particularly around major cities, that ‘generally extend beyond existing districts’ and if authorities are not large enough, ‘special arrangements’will have to be made;
b
the exercise is reorganisation of functions — not redistribution.
So even if the new authorities are small in scale this must not mean that District Council staff are at any advantage in obtaining jobs in the new authorities — staff here must be able to compete on an equal basis (5.7).
2
The Department's submission should press the Region's case to be the Unitary Authority for Lothian, even if we feel the Government is against it — they have not proved the Region is inefficient or ineffective and other parties may turn to the Region's support.
Points in favour:
a
education, social work and strategic planning more efficient and effective at Regional level;
b
can be accompanied by decentralised provision (eg divisional offices) and community councils (6.4);
c
links with areas of other bodies (10.4)
d
better staff quality (11.6)
e
even if local authorities become enabling authorities, a large authority can set common standards over a wide area.
3
In relation to strategic planning, I support your draft Divisional response shown on the overhead, with the following comments:
a
if joint working is to take place it should be statutory — not optional — to ensure the activity takes place and to ensure staff stability;
b
four strategic plan making authorities in Lothian would be ineffective, inefficient and more expensive — and there is a danger that they would have different priorities and perspectives; be parochial; together, not meet the land needs of a growing region; spread specialist staff thinly — perhaps there is post 1986 Met District evidence to support this;
c
the arguments against contracting out Structure Plan preparation can be strengthened:
not just monitoring and review, but also continuous implementation — whether guidance to inquiries, Local Plans, infrastructure providers or developers;
the Lothian experience is that success depends on consultations and discussions during plan preparation, to involve members and the public.
The 1960's and 70's experience of sub-regional studies prepared by consultants shows how few were implemented, because there was no local political commitment to the proposals.
4
The Director encouraged individuals to respond to the Scottish Office — to ensure these efforts are guided, it would be useful if your Divisional response on strategic planning was circulated within our Division as a standard framework.
5
Staff are concerned about how they should get themselves ready for change.
I would suggest it is too early for the Working Group to take a definitive view -Divisions may have to respond differently, it is not clear that consultancy is the answer, there still is opportunity to influence the size of the new authorities and then their structure and staff.
6
Some of my earlier comments (27.3.91) about the dangers associated with Reorganisation still appear relevant!
THE MIDLOTHIAN LOCAL PLAN: INFORMATION REQUEST FROM MIDLOTHIAN DISTRICT COUNCIL
I refer to my earlier memo in connection with the above informing you of Midlothian District Councils intention to prepare a district wide replacement plan.
This local plan will replace the existing local plans for Midlothian District.
The District Council has now forwarded a request for information from the various Regional Council services to assist in the preparation of the local plan, a copy of which is enclosed.
While I understand that the Midlothian Area Social Work Office is in the process of preparing a response, there may be general policy issues which you would wish addressed.
It would be appreciated if a reply could be forwarded to this department by Friday 18 December 1992.
If you are unable to meet this deadline please let me know as soon as possible.
RE: JOB DESCRIPTIONS FOR
1)
INFORMATION AND ENQUIRY SERVICES SUPERVISOR
2)
SENIOR INFORMATION/ENQUIRY ASSISTANT
3)
INFORMATION/ENQUIRY ASSISTANT
With reference to the above, Nalgo is prepared to approve to the job descriptions of 3 March 1993, conditional upon the changes agreed at our meeting of 25 March 1993 being incorporated in the final draft.
We reserve the right to dispute the grades, when awarded.
COMMUNITY CHARGE/COUNCIL TAX RECRUITMENT ARRANGEMENTS
The purpose of this memorandum is to provide employees with some general information about the recruitment arrangements which will apply in the period leading up to the introduction of the Council Tax.
Some of the information provided to you will also be contained in the minutes of meetings referred to in the following paragraph.
If employees have questions on any aspect of this memorandum please raise them with your Head of Section or, if you prefer, with myself or your staff representative.
Regular meetings take place with the Trade Unions on a wide range of staffing issues associated with the Community Charge and the changeover to Council Tax.
A copy of the minute of each meeting will be placed on the notice board(s) within Chesser House.
It should be noted that the terms of this memorandum cover Community Charge employees in the Department of Finance and the Regional Assessor's, and employees involved with the administration of the Valuation Roll and Electoral Registration (Regional Assessors's).
1
COUNCIL OBJECTIVES
In respect of permanent staff within Chesser House, who are employed to undertake Community Charge work, it is the intention of the Regional Council that:
(a)
such permanent staff continue to work for the Council if they wish to do so; and, where possible,
(b)
such permanent staff be accommodated within Chesser House.
2
SINGLE STAFF GROUP
All permanent staff on Community Charge work, irrespective of department, will be regarded as a single staff group.
This means that staff from this group will be given priority over all others when the time comes to filling Council Tax posts or selecting staff for ‘acting-up’ duties.
3 RING FENCING OF VACANCIES
It is recognised that many permanent staff are concerned about getting a job associated with the Council Tax.
To help permanent staff to get jobs the Council Tax posts will be ring fenced around staff from the single staff group.
The actual ring fencing arrangements have still to be discussed with the Trade Unions.
Ring fencing is likely to be along the following lines (commencing with senior posts):
(a)
where the old Community Charge jobs are the same in content/numbers, or nearly the same, as the new Council Tax jobs, the staff in these ‘matched’ posts will simply transfer to the new jobs
(b)
where there are more old jobs than new the ring fence will be placed around the staff in the old posts — and selection for the new jobs will be by competition.
The unsuccessful staff will be included in the next ring down.
Where staff are unsuccessful in obtaining a Council Tax post, some will be accommodated within the Community Charge Team which will deal with the winding-down of the Community Charge, and some will be redeployed to posts in other Departments of the Council in accordance with the Council's Code of Practice on Employee Redeployment and Transfer.
Also, some staff who obtain Council Tax jobs may require to be temporarily transferred to the Community Charge wind-down activities.
4
APPOINTMENTS TO COMMUNITY CHARGE POSTS
You will have noted that appointments to vacancies arising within the Community Charge are normally filled on a temporary basis or a temporary acting-up basis.
This approach means that we do not continue to recruit permanent staff to the Community Charge then perhaps find ourselves with too many permanent staff to fill Council Tax posts.
The benefit of staff acting-up on a temporary basis, is that such staff will be regarded as being within the ring fencing arrangements for both the higher graded posts and their own posts.
Vacancies arising within the General Scales are normally filled on a temporary basis.
5
PROTECTION OF CONTRACTUAL EARNINGS
Appointments to Council Tax posts will be made in accordance with the terms of the Council's Code of Practice on Employee Redeployment and Transfer.
Consequently, if it is necessary to redeploy employees to posts which are graded at a lower salary than the employees original posts, the contractual earnings of such employees will be protected.
6
EMPLOYEE REDEPLOYMENT AND TRANSFER
As well as the arrangements set out in paragraph 5 above, the Council's Code of Practice on Employee Redeployment and Transfer sets out the detailed arrangements in connection with the transfer/redeployment of employees to other posts within the departments of the Council.
These arrangements include:
(a)
Where employees are redeployed to other posts on a compulsory basis, such employees will be entitled to a four week trial period in these posts.
(b)
Employees who are redeployed to posts outwith their recognised employment field will be given priority consideration for any subsequent vacancy which arises in that field for a period of one year following the date of redeployment.
(c)
Any training/retraining which is required as a consequence of the redeployment or transfer of employees will be provided.
Where an employee, who has been redeployed or transferred, undergoing a course of vocational training, sponsored or approved by the Council, arrangements will be made to allow that training to continue.
(d)
Where employees are transferred to posts within locations other than Chesser House, payments of excess travelling expenses/excess travelling time as appropriate will be made in accordance with the Council's approved arrangements.
7
TRAINING
Training will be provided, where required, to employees undertaking Council Tax duties within Chesser House.
Such training will be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Council's Staff Training Scheme.
8
SCHEME OF EARLY RETIRAL AND VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE
The Council has a Scheme of Early Retiral and Voluntary Severance which is applicable to employees who:
(a)
are either members of the Local Government Superannuation Scheme or the Teachers Superannuation Scheme; and
(b)
have attained the age of 50 and have completed two years qualifying service (but less than five years qualifying service).
Eligibility to participate in the Scheme of Early Retiral will be determined by employees satisfying the following criteria: either
(a)
they cease to hold their employment with the Regional Council by reason of voluntary severance, or
(b)
they cease to hold their employment with the Regional Council in the interests of the efficient exercise of the Council's functions.
Further information about the Council's Scheme of Early Retiral and Voluntary Severance can be obtained from Mrs Mary Hynd.
Employees will be kept informed of developments in connection with the Council Tax staffing arrangements.
Dear Colleague
COUNCIL TAX STAFFING — AN UPDATE
As you will be aware there has been extensive discussions with NALGO in connection with the arrangements for the necessary Council Tax introduction.
Despite being very close to an agreement with NALGO it was disappointing for the Special Finance Committee held on the 7 October 1992 to learn that the latest package offer had been rejected and to find that a number of employees had taken industrial action to lobby the meeting.
In deliberating on this important issue the Committee recognised the importance of ensuring that all staff in the Exchequer Division should be clearly informed of the present position.
Consequently, I would draw your attention to the following points:—
1.
WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN AGREED?
The Finance Committee of 16 September approved the agreed structure for all posts above AP5 and two Training Officer posts.
The associated appointment process is nearing completion for these posts.
2
.
WHAT IS NOW PROPOSED?
At this time the following proposals relate only to the Council Tax Processing Section (i.e. Administration and Rebates):—
12 Area Team Leaders — AP5
48 Administrative Assistants — AP2/3
144 Council Tax Assistants — GS3 (incorporating Computer Technology)
Existing permanent staff recruited to the Council Tax Assistant posts will receive higher overall basic earnings through the consolidation of Computer Technology Payments and placement on the salary spinal column.
A further advantage is that the higher new salary will form the basis for future overtime payment calculations whereas Computer Technology Payments were excluded.
Future staff recruited as Council Tax Assistants who have the necessary qualifications and experience will be employed on GS3 with no additional payments but those who require training will be employed on GS1/2 for the duration of a minimum two year training period.
3.
CONCESSIONS ALREADY MADE BY THE COUNCIL
In addition to the above package offer the Council has to date agreed:—
(a)
to delay the implementation of the new structure until the present time as requested by NALGO to allow greater consultation;
(b)
to combine the Administrative and Benefits functions at this stage as requested by NALGO rather than later as intended;
(c)
improve the grade for the new combined Council Tax Assistants posts from GS2/3 to GS3 having regard to all aspects of the duties;
(d)
to ensure continuing employment with the Council for existing permanent staff affected by the restructuring, as far as possible at Chesser House;
(e)
to ‘ring-fence’ appointments to the above posts by restricting applications to existing permanent staff currently working on Community Charge within the  Exchequer Division, Finance Department and the Regional Assessor's Department; and
(f)
to keep the structure and grading arrangements under review in the light of experience.
4.
FINANCE COMMITTEE DECISION
At the meeting on the 7 October the Committee heard a deputation from NALGO prior to considering the matter in detail.
Consequently it was decided to approve the proposals outlined in Section 2 above and to authorise the Director of Finance to initiate the appointment process.
These decisions will be considered by the Personnel Committee on the 13 October and further discussions with NALGO will follow.
The Council has worked hard to secure agreement on the proposals and it must be stressed that the improved package offer presented recently to NALGO represents the best balance between the interests of staff involved and Council Tax payers.
It is also important that you understand that the Council has a legal obligation to implement the Council Tax without further delay and that the Council will require to take all necessary steps to ensure that the matter is speedily progressed.
The Finance Committee are of the view that the structure proposed for Council Tax implementation offers a very fair financial improvement for existing and future clerical staff along with a better work mix for employees.
Should you wish any further clarification on any aspect of this issue please contact A Stein (ext 5002), M Peterson (ext 5005 or A Nairn (ext 5011).
Yours sincerely
EXCHEQUER DIVISION — COUNCIL TAX STAFFING
As you are aware discussions have been continuing between the Finance Department, MSD and NALGO concerning the Exchequer Division staffing/ structure for Council Tax.
To allow staff appointments to be made in good time for work to be undertaken for Council Tax it is necessary to go to the Finance Committee on 16 September 1992 with a staff structure, some of which is still subject to review, for example the Control Sections.
I detail below a table showing the existing establishment for Community Charge Administration/Benefits and the proposed establishment for Council Tax Administration/Benefits.
Although there is a reduction in the number of accounts of 44%, after due consideration has been given to the anticipated workload arising from discounts/exemptions/second adult rebates etc the actual proposed staffing reduction is 15%.
It is hoped to achieve the 15% reduction in staffing by the employment of temporary staff as vacancies occur and this policy has been operating since 1 April 1992.
From 1 April 1993 in addition to Council Tax the department estimates there will be a need for some 60/70 staff to deal with the administration of Community Charges.
Hopefully the above information together with the Job Descriptions which are now available will be of assistance to you in understanding the department's proposals for Council Tax.
However as this is a new tax the structure/procedures will be kept under review.
COUNCIL TAX STRUCTURE AND STAFFING LEVELS
I have been giving a great deal of consideration towards the most effective Council Tax structure to be adopted based on the experiences of Community Charge to date.
The various possible structures have been discussed with senior management in the Exchequer Division.
The general view is in accord with our previous discussions on this matter, that is we should move towards multi-disciplinary teams for all Council Tax purposes.
I have therefore taken my discussions with senior staff one step further and have drawn up a discussion document on Council Tax Structure and Staffing which addresses the various issues currently being examined.
In addition to the structure I have also provisionally examined the numbers of staff likely to be needed for Council Tax purposes having regard to experiences of Poll Tax over recent years.
I have therefore included in the discussion document my estimate of staffing requirements adjusted towards the philosophy behind the structure proposed and taken on board the comments of my senior staff.
I enclose herewith a copy of this  discussion document for your consideration.
In view of the limited time available before the scheduled date for Advance Data Capture for Council Tax purposes I will ask my secretary to set up a meeting to discuss this document and Council Tax structures and staffing levels in a couple of weeks time.
If you wish any further clarification or discussions on this paper before the meeting please give me a ring on the number below.
DISCUSSION DOCUMENT — COUNCIL TAX STRUCTURE AND STAFFING LEVELS
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
Before the final structure and numbers of staff required to deal with Council Tax can be finalised there are various issues which need to be addressed.
1.2
Issues which need to be considered include:
1.2.1
The use to be made of new technology such as‘Office Power’ and ‘Imaging’.
1.2.2
The use of multi disciplinary teams or alternatively the degree of specialisation of sections within the Exchequer Division.
1.2.3
The need to deal effectively in the first instance in communications with Council Tax payers, both face to face and in writing, and hence the seniority of staff required for this purpose.
2 NEW TECHNOLOGY
2.1
The use of new technology facilities would greatly improve the efficiency of dealing with individual cases and correspondence.
It would also restore a greater degree of control to individual officers in dealing with cases.
2.2
The use of a software package such as‘Office Power’ with the ability to generate on-line a standard response to correspondence would dramatically improve the response time in dealing with most enquiries from individual and ensure that a response is made within a matter of days.
2.3
The use of a facility such as‘Office Power’ would thus reduce the pressure on staff dealing with more complicated cases where a much more detailed and individual response is required.
This should also eventually result in a reduction in the volume of mail being dealt with in the Typing Pool and hence eliminate the backlog which has been evident since the introduction of Community Charge.
2.4
The use of a facility such as‘Office Power’ and its electronic mail capabilities would ensure that all aspects of a case could be considered timeously without fear of hard copy correspondence being lost between different sections inadvertently or otherwise not actioned.
2.5
Imaging technology has come a long way in the last few years and there are currently available several Imaging systems which in theory could integrate with Council Tax software.
2.6
The use of Imaging would greatly facilitate the management and control of correspondence.
It would ensure that correspondence is included in an individual's electronic in-tray quickly and issues dealt with promptly.
In addition it would enable correspondence that deals with several aspects of Council Tax to be dealt with at the same time and a co-ordinated response to be prepared by nominated officers.
2.7
Given the overwhelming advantages in providing a better service for taxpayers the provision of ‘Office Power’ and ‘Imaging’is recommended.
The following considerations of Council Tax structures and staffing levels are based on the assumption that ‘Office Power’(or some similar package) and Imaging system is provided and available before the end of  the 1992.
3 EXCHEQUER DIVISION STRUCTURE
3.1
One of the problems of dealing with Community Charge, apart from sheer volumes has been the fact that different issues have been dealt with by different sections.
Despite efforts by staff to integrate different issues as far as an individual is concerned this has not always been possible given the present working practice, locations and procedures.
3.2
If an effective service is to be provided to taxpayers then it is essential that wherever possible the breakdown of service provision between different sections is overcome.
One way of doing this would be to provide multipurpose teams dealing with all aspects of Council Tax for a particular geographic area.
3.3
One way of moving towards this would be to have a Council Tax Administration Team dealing with the same geographic area as a Council Tax Rebate Team.
This would be a step in the right direction, however the 2 teams would still be separate within the organisation and would not necessarily operate in practice as one team.
3.4
In order to overcome this it is necessary to have a manager for a particular geographic area of the Region who would be responsible for a team of staff dealing with all aspects of Council Tax (assessment of liability, billing, collection, recovery and enforcement, rebate and discount entitlements and exemptions).
Individual members of staff within such a team would have particular responsibilities, so that one member of staff could be responsible for discounts, other members of staff having specific responsibility for assessment and exemptions etc.
However the whole team would be responsible for all aspects of Council Tax for individual taxpayers in that area.
3.5
If such a structure is to work in practice then it is necessary to keep the teams comparatively small so that they can work together as a unit.
If the team becomes too large then in practice it could well break down into sub-teams and not be as effective as intended.
3.6
I am therefore recommending that each Senior Assistant within Council Tax should be responsible for a team of staff dealing with all aspects of Council Tax for a geographic area.
Furthermore I am suggesting that each team should be no larger than 16 staff.
3.7
This would then mean that there should be 12 teams or thereabouts each dealing with a particular geographic area of the Region for all aspects of Council Tax.
(see section 5)
4 SENIOR STRUCTURE
4.1
Given the philosophy set out in the previous section it is essential that the Senior Administrative Assistant have able and experienced Principal Officers who they can turn to and that such Principal Officers should not be overstretched by dealing with individual cases but are available to direct and manage operations.
4.2
Given the experience of Community Charge I would recommend that there be 4 Principal Officers each responsible for 3 multipurpose teams.
4.3
Given the legal complexities of Community Charge and the rate of change it is essential that there are senior managers at the higher Principal Officer grade who can be responsible for particular aspects of Council Tax as well as being responsible for an operational group.
4.4
I therefore recommend that there should be:
4.4.1
a Council Tax Rebates Manager, who will be the Council's rebate expert and consultant and also the operational manager for 2 of the groups headed up by Principal Officers
4.4.2
a Council Tax Manager, who will be the Council's expert and consultant on all Council Tax issues as well as being the operational manager for the further 2 groups.
4.5
This will then leave all the other issues of the Exchequer Division to be dealt with, preferably in a third group, under the direct supervision of the Assistant Director, who would also be responsible for all Council Tax matters on behalf of the Depute Director as required.
4.6
This would mean that Non-Domestic Rates, Service Accounts, Cash and Enquiry Office, Council Tax Control Team, Parking Permits and Support Services would be grouped together under the direct supervision of the Assistant Director.
4.7
Looking at the Support Services this would include Typing, Office Administration, Training Officers, External Collection and Enquiry Officers and the Mail Room.
To provide for these services to be provided efficiently and to avoid the Assistant Director being involved in detailed matters in these areas to the detriment of his managerial responsibility it is recommended that an Office Manager be appointed who would co-ordinate all these activities.
4.8
I have therefore set out on the attached sheet the recommended Council Tax structure at the senior level.
5 COUNCIL TAX STAFFING REQUIREMENTS
5.1
I have drawn up on the attached sheet the numbers of staff required in my estimation to deal with Council Tax in the future.
In arriving at these estimates I have based them on the following estimations and assumptions:
5.1.1
The new technology referred to in section 2 is fully utilised and available from the beginning of Council Tax.
5.1.2.
In order to deal effectively at the front line of enquiries it is essential that these are dealt with by experienced and capable staff at the Administrative Assistant level.
Therefore there has been a proportionate increase in the number of Administrative Assistants with a comparable reduction in the Clericals who would be carrying out more routine clerical duties under the Administrative Assistant's direction.
Consistent with this approach I have also deleted the GS3 level within the rebates area.
5.1.3.
The number of Council Tax administrative staff below Senior Assistant level have been arrived at in total by examining the Community Charge case load per member of staff, projecting this on the basis of estimated case load for Council Tax and increasing this by 20% in order to deal with the personal elements of Council Tax, which were previously dealt with by the Community Charge Registration Officer.
5.1.4.
The Council Tax administration numbers have also been increased by a further 10% to deal with those administrative matters currently dealt with within the Community Charge Control Section, as the items should really be dealt with within the teams to provide a comprehensive service to taxpayers.
5.1.5.
The Community Charge Control Team should therefore be restricted to computer and management control functions under the separate supervision of the Assistant Director, that is outwith the operational line management.
5.1.6.
The numbers within the Council Tax Control Team have been based on a pro rata of case load plus a 20% increase for personal elements less a nominal number to reflect the transfer of routine functions to the operational teams.
5.1.7.
The number of rebate staff within each team has been based on the following:
5.1.7.1.
1,000 cases per Clerical Assistant for routine rebates
5.1.7.2.
1,250 cases per Clerical Assistant for second adult rebates
5.1.7.3.
One Administrative Assistant per 4 Clerical Assistants, taking account of deletion of GS3
5.1.8.
The Rebates and Non-Domestic Rates/Service Accounts Control staff have been amalgamated with the Council Tax Control Team in order to provide one Control Section under the separate control of the Assistant Director.
5.1.9.
The Cash Collection/Enquiry Service follows the same philosophy of experienced and capable staff dealing with enquiries at the counter and so there has been an increase in the Administrative Assistants required for this service with a compensating reduction in clerical staff.
5.1.10
Given the time needed to deal with the residue of Poll Tax no reduction in Support Services, including typing is being suggested at this time and other services are expected to continue as at present.
6 POLL TAX RESIDUE
6.1
Ultimately it should be possible to cease activities within the office on Poll Tax matters and leave the Sheriff Officers to collect monies due, although this may well be several years off.
6.2
Therefore for at least the first year of Council Tax I have included a separate section to deal exclusively with Poll Tax residue issues, although in practice many of these posts will need to be filled by temporary secondments back from Council Tax structures, staff unsuccessful in obtaining permanent positions initially within the Council Tax structure and temporary staff.
6.3
The Poll Tax Section included on the structure attached herewith is based on the present levels of staff dealing with recovery and enforcement.
It may be possible to reduce the numbers within this section during the year dependent on the success of recovery and collection.
7 CONCLUSION
7.1
I am therefore recommending the attached structure and numbers of staff to deal with Council Tax with effect from 1 April 1993, although appointments will have to be made considerably in advance of that date.
7.2
The structure and staffing numbers will be kept under review in the light of experience and revised (upwards or downwards) as necessary, together with any revisions to job descriptions required.
LOTHIAN REGIONAL COUNCIL
GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE
SCOTTISH ACCIDENT PREVENTION COUNCIL — SUBSCRIPTION
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1
The Regional Council has been asked to pay a subscription fee to the Scottish Accident Prevention Council (SAPC) in 1993/94.
2.
DETAILS
2.1
The Regional Council has paid a subscription fee to SAPC for many years.
Until 1992/93, it had paid the level requested by the SAPC.
In 1992/93, the request was for a 40% increase on the previous year's subscription from 50p per 1,000 population (£371.50) to 70p per 1,000 population(£520.03).
2.2
The Committee awarded a grant of £386 based on the 1991/92 payment plus a 4% inflationary allowance given to all organisations seeking financial support on an annual basis.
2.3
SAPC at its AGM in October 1992 agreed to limit its increase to 1·5% on the 1992/93 subscription.
As a result, it has asked for £528 from Lothian Region for 1993/94.
2.4
The Miscellaneous Grants Budget 1993/94 allows for support of £396 based on last year's figure plus 2.5% inflation.
2.5
SAPC continues to set subscription fees on a level of population for local authorities only.
Other organisations pay a flat rate, with health boards being asked for £34.50 a year, national  institutions £29 a year, commercial organisations £69 a year and registered charities and individuals £11.50 a year.
3.
RECOMMENDATION
3.1
It is recommended that the Committee consider the request for payment of a subscription fee of £528 to the Scottish Accident Prevention Council.
CONFERENCES
I refer to the decision of the Labour Group that in the first instance all Conference items should be submitted to the Labour Group Executive for approval before being placed on a committee agenda.
All these Conference items should be co-ordinated through my secretary, Mrs Mitchell.

MEMORANDUM
Your attention is hereby drawn to the provisions of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968.
Copies of this statute can be obtained from any branch of Her Majesty's Stationery Office.
In particular your attention is directed to the following sections of the said Act:
(1)
Section 1 makes it a criminal offence for any person acting in the course of trade or business to supply, or offer to supply goods to which a false trade description is applied.
(2)
Section 2 of the Act defines the expression ‘trade description’ and this definition includes an indication direct or indirect about
(a)
the approval by any person, or conformity with a type approved by any person of any goods
(b)
the person by whom the goods are manufactured, produced, processed or reconditioned.
(3)
Section 3 and 4 make provisions regarding ‘false’ trade descriptions.
(4)
Section 24 provides statutory defences available to persons who can prove:
1(a)
that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake or to reliance on information supplied to him or to the act or default of another person, an accident or some other cause beyond his control; and
1(b)
that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such offence by himself or any person under his control.
In any proceedings for an offence under this Act of supplying or offering to supply goods to which a false trade description is applied it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained, that the goods did not conform to the description or that the description had been applied to the goods.
Of which notice is hereby given.
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ACT 1985
Public Weighing Equipment
NOTES FOR GUIDANCE OF CERTIFICATED WEIGHERS
The following is issued for the guidance of persons attending to a weighing carried out on a weighbridge made available for use by the public and for which a charge is made:—
1.
It is essential to keep the instrument in correct balance at all times.
This should be checked at regular intervals and especially on commencing work for the day.
Changes in weather conditions or dirt on the plate will cause alterations in the balance.
It is therefore imperative that the plate should be kept clean at all times and the space between the plate and the surround kept clear.
The balance key must be used to maintain accuracy and  if at any time this cannot be done with the key, the matter should be reported immediately to your superior.
2.
When a vehicle is being weighed, the weigher should satisfy himself that all the wheels are on the plate and clear of the surround, and that no person is on the vehicle or the plate, or interfering in any way which might affect the weighing, and the engine must be switched off.
3.
It is important that gross and tare weighings should not be entered on a single ticket unless the interval between the two weighings is less than 24 hours.
To meet this requirement, it will be necessary for weighers to keep their own record of tare weighings carried out, including time of taring and where removable parts, eg. sides, rear boards, tarpaulins, sacks, etc. are in use, whether these parts are included in the tare.
Even under such conditions there may be cases where a weigher, from his own observations, is not satisfied that the vehicle is in the same condition as when tared.
In such cases, he should ask that the lorry be re-tared within 24 hours and retain the ticket until this is done, or alternatively, he may follow the procedure in Note 4.
4.
Where a vehicle has not been tared in accordance with Note 3, a ‘Gross Weight’ ticket only should be issued.
Documents must not be handed to drivers or otherwise issued with blank spaces for recording particulars of tare weights or net weights.
If there are not entries in any spaces, they must either be crossed through, or cancelled by inserting words such as‘not ascertained’ or ‘vehicle not tared’.
5.
Weight tickets should include dates and times of weighings and these must always be inserted.
Similarly, particulars of the load and registration number of the vehicle must also be inserted.
The true weights must be recorded accurately.
6.
For obvious reasons, all entries and cancellations on documents must be made indelibly.
Alterations are to be avoided and if a mistake is made, the ticket should be immediately cancelled and a fresh document used.
7.
All Certified Weighers should make themselves familiar with Section 20 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985, which is attached.
Records of public weighings must be retained for inspection for a period of at least two years.

VEHICLE UTILISATION SURVEY 4 — 31 MAY 1993 TO 6 JUNE 1993
Thank you for your memo of 23 July 1993 detailing findings of the above survey.
I enclose the 2 outstanding vehicle utilisation census forms duly completed for the Vauxhall Astra Estate and Leyland DAF Van, both located at Chesser House.
I would apologise for not returning these before 10 June 1993 which was due to an error on our behalf, and can assure you that all future returns will be sent timeously.
I am writing to advise that I have taken over the role of Computer Liaison Officer for the Trading Standards Department.
I would appreciate if any future correspondence could be forwarded for my attention instead of C M Galbraith.
Please find attached a memorandum to the Depute Chief Executive from the Chief Constable regarding the above.
Please can you make the necessary arrangement for the Road Closure Orders to be implemented as requested.
HERIOT WATT
Given the increasing use of traffic signals on rural roads on the west side of Edinburgh, I would like a report submitted to me on the feasibility of using traffic signals as access to the Heriot Watt site.
The signals linked to:
a)
the signals provided by the SDD at Colinton Road Junction;
b)
advanced warning gantries on A71 to reduce speeds e.g. like a mini CITRAC
PILOT OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SCHEME
The Pilot Occupational Health Scheme Contract Documents were signed with Lothian Health Board on 5 July 1993.
The new core services with Lothian Health Board comprise the following:—
Pre-employment Screening
Workplace Inspections and Reports
Routine Health Surveillance
Medical Referrals
Health Education and Training
Advice and Guidance
Counselling
Statutory Examination
Additional services can be purchased if required from LHB and the following are available:—
Baseline Health Screening
Audiometry
LGV Medical Examinations
Immunisation  Programmes 
Health Promotion
Identification of Health Hazards
Therefore normal in-house arrangements with the Council's Medical Adviser and other bodies will be suspended during the pilot project.
Medical Referrals and other Referrals will therefore now be sent to Lothian Health Board with myself as the Contact Officer.
Appended to this memo is a copy of the Medical Referral Document together with Guidelines for Managers and Supervisors.
The Line Managers should attempt to complete as much information as possible on the referral document.
The employee should also be asked to complete a Consent Form (also appended to this memo).
Both documents should then be sent to myself (in my absence my Personnel Staff will deal with arrangements with LHB).
LHB have given timetables for Medical Referrals of 5 working days from receipt of referral for an employee to be seen by an Occupational Health Nurse and 10 working days for an Occupational Health Physician.
I am confident that the new Occupational Health Services will benefit both the employees and the Department and I will be pleased to discuss further details with you.
EYESIGHT TESTING AND PROVISION OF SPECTACLES FOR V.D.U.
OPERATORS — INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS
The Regional Council's Code of Practice on the Introduction of Computer Technology (May 1989) made provision for voluntary screening arrangements for V.D.U.
operators and this is currently undertaken by Iain McCarter, Safety Officer and Mike Woloszyn, Assistant Safety Officer.
However, under the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 which came into force on 1 January 1993 ‘users’ shall be provided, at their request, with eye and eyesight tests and required corrective appliances at the expense of their employer.
A user is deemed to be a member of staff who:—
(a)
is authorised by the Head of Department to use display screen equipment and
(b)
normally uses display screen equipment on a daily basis for a continuous spell of at least one hour at any time (or an equivalent duration).
The Personnel Manager has advised Heads of Department to continue to operate the present voluntary screening programme except:—
(a)
Where a user makes a specific request to exercise their statutory right for an eyesight examination by an  ophthalmic optician, either as an alternative to or in addition to the voluntary screening programme, then the request should be  accommodated and during this interim period the user permitted to use an  ophthalmic optician of their choice.
The cost of the eyesight examination will be refunded.
The user should claim the expense by completing a Form SA1 in the normal way.
(b)
Where the user takes advantage of the voluntary vision screening programme and as a consequence of vision defects at the viewing distances used specifically for the display screen work concerned is recommended to have a full eyesight examination by an  ophthalmic optician, then during this interim period, the user will be permitted to use an  ophthalmic optician of their own choice.
The cost of the eyesight examination will be refunded.
The user should claim the expense by completing a Form SA1 in the normal way.
(c)
Where the  ophthalmic optician subsequently prescribes special corrective appliances  solely to correct vision defects at the viewing distances used specifically for the display screen work concerned, and where normal corrective appliances (ie those prescribed for any other purposes) cannot be used, during this interim period, a Head of Department will refund such costs up to a maximum of £50.
Users who in terms of para (c) above chose to select special corrective appliances which cost in excess of £50, will be responsible for the additional cost.
The above arrangements will apply retrospectively from 1 January 1993 to cover all eligible users.
The above interim arrangements have been discussed and agreed in principle with NALGO but will be kept under review during the interim period.
Should you require any further clarification please telephone W McCarter, Departmental Safety Officer (031–469 3660).
SCHEME: A89 B800 JUNCTION, NEWBRIDGE & cairnmuir ROAD, EDINBURGH
CONTRACT NO: 20267
I hereby certify, in accordance with Clause 61 of the Conditions of Contract, that the Contractor fulfilled his obligations to construct, complete and maintain the Works to my satisfaction on 10 August 1993.
NEW ROADS AND STREETWORKS ACT 1991 STREETWORKS 93: A PRACTITIONERS' GUIDE TO THE NEW STREETWORKS LAW
I enclose ONE copy of this publication for your section's use.
CORPORATE IDENTITY — SUPPLY OF MATERIAL USING CREST OR LOGO
Please find enclosed a memorandum from the Corporate Planning Manager regarding the above.
Please send any material you have to Pam Harrison, Room 3.18, Regional Headquarters.
CORPORATE IDENTITY — SUPPLY OF MATERIAL USING CREST OR LOGO
I would be grateful if you could arrange for one copy of all your departmental letterheads, leaflets, forms and publications which use the logo Lothian Regional Council, the crest or any departmental logos, to be sent to Pamela Bruce, Corporate Services Department, Room 3.13, Regional Headquarters, George IV Bridge, Edinburgh.
This exercise is in association with the consideration of the development and promotion of a Corporate Identity for Lothian Regional Council.
The findings and proposals will be reported to the Chief Executive's Management Group.
INFOSHEETS
Unfortunately the CIG meeting on 14 July, at which it had been planned to discuss the revamping of the Infopack, had to be cancelled because of the large number of apologies due to holidays and sickness.
As it will not be possible for the group to meet again before October we are going to go ahead and reprint the Infosheets for Field Services/Hospitals, Children and Families, voluntary Organisations and Mental Health with amendments as an interim measure.
COMMUNITY CARE MATTERS NEWSLETTER
Jan Cochran has written to Pat about the above and, amongst other things, has asked if we are planning to invite the voluntary sector to contribute.
I have replied saying I will pass this suggestion on to you.
RECEPTION — HOURS OF WORK
You will be aware that Nancy Brown and Reception staff have been considering a staggered approach to Reception staff hours especially given the computerised directory system currently being introduced.
This will also avoid the need for an overtime element during absences which has been required in the past.
I think it is important that we undertake this on an initial trial basis as there may be problems not yet envisaged.
It also gives the new caretaker a chance to settle to his tasks without the added problem of learning switchboard.
However he should be aware that this might become one of his duties if for any reason we revert to the previous arrangements after the initial trial.
I hope too that you find it helpful to caretaking staff in that it reduces the time that they safeguard the front entrance by 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at the end of the day.
I attach a copy of the reply I received from MacKenzie Storrie to my letter of 23 July, a copy of which I sent to you.
I also attach a copy of my reply, from which you will see I have told Mike Templeman that I would take up his claim that he didn't have enough information on which to base an accurate estimate with you.
I'd be grateful if you would ring me sometime to let me have your views.
Our relationship does seem to be improving but obviously I'm worried that we now seem to be paying 50% more than we expected.
SECURITY
Please nominate a divisional representative to meet me in my office at 4.00 pm on Thursday, 19 November 1992, to discuss the proposed security measures outlined in my report to Directorate (copy attached).
Joyce Allan and Fred Penfold will also take part in this meeting which will hopefully produce recommendations for our next Directorate meeting.
DIRECTORATE
SECURITY
1
At our last Directorate it was noted that there had been further difficulties with unauthorised visitors and it was agreed that there was a need for additional security between the entrance foyer and offices.
It was suggested that a small working group of staff should investigate and report.
2
Coincident with this, I received a letter from the Police regarding false intruder alarm calls.
I therefore arranged a meeting with Colin Campbell of DOMIS for representatives of all departments using 12/24 St Giles Street to consider both issues.
3
Colin Campbell advised us that he was reporting to the General Purposes Committee on 3 December 1992 on the security of Headquarters buildings, recommending that all visitors sign in on arrival, receive and must wear a Visitor Identity Tag and sign out when leaving.
This practice is already in operation at Chesser House.
All staff will require to wear their identity card within a holder, which would facilitate the use of the card for flexitime purposes, although cards for these purposes could remain separate if required.
4
It was agreed that we should be supplied with samples of the cards and holders for consideration before they are introduced.
5
It was also agreed that the same card could be used to operate the locks which have already been installed on doors within the foyer, although not so far activated.
Colin Campbell is to check whether all doors have locks and the effect of fire regulations on these.
6
With regard to the false intruder alarm calls, it was agreed that the instruction to staff will require to be re-issued.
This must form a part of the induction information package for new staff and existing staff w ill require to be reminded periodically.

LOTHIAN RAIL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Thank you for your letter of 9 October.
Our intended publication of a Lothian Rail Development Strategy has slipped somewhat, and I am not in a position to give you an indication of likely completion dates.
I note that RDS would like to have an input to this work, and would be pleased to consider anything that you wish to submit.
I must however caution that financial and other constraints compel us to plan more conservatively than I imagine you would wish.
The only new track which we envisage in the next 10–15 years is the possible construction of a new west-east chord to the South of Dalmeny, and the only new passenger services is a possible re-opening of the South Suburban line.
Yours sincerely,
Dear 
CONTRACT MLOO9, EXTENSION TO CUIKEN
Thank you for providing this Department with a quotation for amending contract MLOO9.
We had asked for the additional cost of providing an extension of the present service to the Cuiken area of Penicuik.
I note that you quoted an additional cost of £2 per journey.
I confirm that this price is acceptable to us and we agree to the introduction of the extension to contracted journeys as soon as possible.
I attach amended schedule C2 pages for contract MLOO9 showing the revised route, times and fares required.
At a cost of £2 per journey the total increase in weekly contract price will be £40.
Therefore, the total weekly cost of contract MLOO9 will be increased to £250.43.
Please prepare a new timetable for your Leadburn to Penicuik service showing the new extensions to Cuiken and make arrangements to register the change with the Traffic Commissioner.
If you have any queries please contact Clive Brown on 031–469 3893.
Yours sincerely
Dear 
COUNCIL TAX STAFFING — CONTROL AND COLLECTION SECTIONS
Further to our meeting concerning the Council Tax Staffing Report on the Control and Collection Sections I am writing to confirm our agreement in order to progress this matter to Committee and to the making of appointments.
Whilst the job descriptions for the Control Section were evaluated on the basis of the inclusion of Non-Domestic Rates and Service Accounts control functions.
I confirm that the Administrative Assistant and Clerical Assistants will not be required to carry out these duties pending a review of the Control Section.
In order to deal with the control of Non-Domestic Rates and Service Accounts 3 posts and staff will be transferred from the Non-Domestic Rates and Service Accounts Sections for this purpose, pending a review of the Control Section.
There will be a full review of the Control Section, covering job descriptions, duties and job evaluations, during 1993 and this will be concluded before 31 December 1993.
The job descriptions of the 4 Clerical Assistants in the banking area of the Collection Section will be reviewed and re-evaluated with a view to bringing them into line with other posts within the ring fence if possible, that is the consolidation of the new technology allowance.
The results of this exercise will be reported to a future meeting of the Finance Committee.
Mike Peterson will provide you with copies of the final job descriptions for the Collection Section.
I trust that in the light of this letter you will now be able to lend your support to the proposals being put to the Finance Committee on 9 December 1992.
Yours sincerely

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
The Council Tax staffing report approved by the Committee on 7 October 1992 included outline proposals for the Control and Collection Sections which were noted as requiring further work.

COUNCIL TAX LETTERS
I refer to your fax of 24 May 1993 asking for comments/answers on various questions to enable you to reply on behalf of the Convener to correspondence he has received from Council Tax payers.
I have set out below a brief paragraph in respect of each question which you could use in your replies, however I would be grateful if you would qualify any replies to indicate that these are general answers and that any specific queries on individual cases should be referred to the Council Tax Section at Chesser House or myself.
1
How much unpaid Poll Tax has been carried forward into this year's budget?
Provisions have been made in previous years for anticipated levels of unpaid Community Charge (poll tax).
No Community Charge arrears have been carried forward into this year's budget.
2
Why is Council Tax due to be paid on 6th of each month when Poll Tax was paid on 15th?
The former Community Charge was payable on a variety of days depending on the payment method used and this procedure has been carried forward to Council Tax.
Council Tax Demands are due on a variety of dates each month in order to spread the workload on Council staff and our agents.
This will mean that some individuals now have a different payment date for Council Tax to that they previously had for Community Charge.
3
Why do Water Rates vary with Tax Bands?
The legislation specifies that the Council Tax varies in accordance with the Valuation Band of the property.
The legislation also specifies that the Water Charges will similarly vary in accordance with the Valuation Band of individual properties.
The Council sets the level of Council Tax and Water Charge for a Band D property and charges for each other band are in accordance with the prescribed formula set out by the Government.
4
Poll Tax was fairer than Council Tax?— Convener to answer this one but see what facts and figures can be found to back up his argument.
This is a matter of opinion.
5
Why has Transitional Relief Scheme been worth less than publicised?— someone referred to an article in the Scotsman on this on 12 March 1993.
Also get from the Finance Dept. information on how Transitional Relief works.
The Council Tax Transitional Reduction Scheme is designed to limit the increase the household incurs when comparing the former Community Charge liability with Council Tax liability.
However Transitional Reduction is calculated on a Scheme Council Tax in accordance with the Government Regulations and not in accordance with the actual Council Tax levied by the Region and District Councils, in addition water charges are excluded from both years.
6
Difficulties in administering the Poll Tax?— examples.
There were a variety of difficulties in administering the former Community Charge, one of the main ones was in maintaining an accurate Community Charge Register of all individuals resident within the Region at any particular time.
10
Why has lump sum payment been brought forward to 31 May?
The payment of the year's charge by a single payment, that is a lump sum payment, has always been linked to the date when recovery procedures can commence in order that lump sum payers are subject to the same recovery procedures as monthly instalment payers.
The Council Tax legislation enables recovery action to be taken once a single instalment has been missed, that is at the end of May.
It was therefore decided by the Council that anyone who elects to pay by a single lump sum payment should do so by or on 31 May in any one year.
11
Why do we not offer discounts for full payment?
Having considered the potential benefits of offering discounts for full payment of Council Tax the Council has decided for the first year that it is not beneficial and that therefore no discounts will be offered for full payment.
This position will be reconsidered at the end of the first year.
12
Second homes — why 50% relief when it was void relief under Poll Tax?
Second homes were liable for Standard Community Charge which was normally at twice the personal rate.
The legislation did enable authorities to grant various reliefs to second homes in certain situations and Lothian Region exercised its discretion in certain cases (see attached letter re Standard Community Charge).
The Council Tax legislation prescribes that second homes shall be granted a 50% discount from the full liability and no longer enable the Council to grant discretionary relief in any circumstances.
Relief can be granted for limited periods when a property first becomes unoccupied and unfurnished, generally for a period of 6 months.
13
What is the total amount of cumulative arrears of Poll Tax at 31 March 1993?
The total Community Charge arrears at 31 March 1993 as reported to the Council were £148m which represents over 10% of the total liabilities for the 4 years of Community Charge.
The Council is continuing to collect these arrears from individuals and to pursue debtors by all the means available under the legislation.
I trust the above will enable you to deal with general questions addressed to the Convener on Council Tax.
MANUAL WORKERS' REVIEW — CAR PARK ATTENDANT (COWGATE AND FISHMARKET CLOSE), CHARGEHAND CLEANER (SPRINGWELL HOUSE)
At a recent meeting the Local Joint Working Party considered the appropriate grades for the above posts.
The Local Joint Working Party were of the opinion that the duties and responsibilities of the post of Car Park Attendant (Cowgate and Fishmarket Close) matched with Scottish Job Outline 28, Car Park Attendant (Grade 1).
This also matched with the grading for the post of Car Park Attendant (Regional Headquarters).
With regard to the grading of the Chargehand Cleaner post at Springwell House the local Joint Working Party's view was that the post should be graded Manual Worker Grade 1 plus the appropriate Chargehand allowance.
The local Joint Working Party could not explain why the post had been graded by the National Joint Council's Assimilation Panel on two occasions.
Both these gradings are effective from 12 July 1987.
As far as I am aware all manual posts within your Department have now been assimilated and all appeals have been dealt with.
I would be grateful if you would confirm that this was the case.
If you wish to discuss any of the above contact Mr J Kilpatrick of my Employer Relations Section who will be pleased to assist you.
