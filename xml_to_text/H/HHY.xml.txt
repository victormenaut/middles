Linear dynamic models are widely used for economic forecasting and policy analysis.
An AR
(1)
model is a simple dynamic model in which there is only one lagged dependent variable.
The model is typically estimated by least squares and tests of the individual regression coefficients are based on the usual regression t statistics.
Since the exact distribution of the t statistics is complicated, in practice it is approximated by the well known Student's t distribution.
Under certain conditons this approximation gets better as the sample size gets larger.
The use of this approximation raises two questions:
(a)
How well does this approximation work?
(b)
Can the approximation be improved in small samples?
The purpose of this research project is to investigate these two questions.
Previous studies by the principal investigator and others have indicated that the approximation may not be satisfactory for the samples sizes typical in economic applications.
The project examines this case in detail and considers methods for improving the accuracy of the approximation which are easy to carry out in practice.

Much data in geography are in the form of counts, and a frequent question of interest is the relation of an average count to a set of explanatory variables.
The conventional approach to such questions is to use ordinary least squares regression methods, which are often unsatisfactory.
The Poisson distribution is increasingly used for count data, and efficient fitting methods give better results than ordinary least squares.
A major problem in the use of this distribution is that reported data are often in the form of totals or aggregates, summed over potentially important explanatory variables.
Aggregation results in mixed or compound Poisson distributions which cannot be fitted by standard methods.
This research project develops efficient computational fitting methods for a wide range of compound Poisson distributions for count data in geography, and in collaboration with geographers, assembles and analyses a representative collection of data sets in geography for which compound Poisson distributions are appropriate.

The ESRC Centre in Economic Computing was established at the London School of Economics in July 1983.
The Centre aims to provide resources to ensure that economists in universities and polytechnics have access to high quality software for the management and analysis of economic data.
It is important for the Centre to establish an environment in which the difficulties facing the academic economist in developing, programming and verifying new techniques are minimised.
It is also important to ensure that programs for new techniques, once developed, are made available widely to others.
The Centre is required to become self-supporting so that it is necessary to establish links with government and the business and commercial worlds and to ensure that the programs it produces for the academic community are also attractive to the commercial market-place.
Thus the Centre has a dual role involving the understanding of the needs of both the academic and the non-academic communities which is particularly challenging.
The Centre keeps a close eye on developments in economic computing and publishes a regular Bulletin which is distributed widely.
A Register of Econometric Software is maintained and is published regularly.
Economic theory and particularly its practical application can only make significant progress if economists can exchange ideas and experience.
Personal discussions, conferences and the publication of papers and articles must be supported by easy-to-use programs providing access to the new techniques.
Although research economists usually make their programs available to others, they have neither the time nor the resources to document and support them properly.
Still less do they have time to develop them further for release to a wider and less technical audience.
Many potentially valuable programs remain unused and unexploited.
It is a responsibility of the Centre to provide support to the academic economist developing programs for new techniques and to make appropriate programs commercially available outside the academic environment.
Work is in progress on the design and development of software for the management and analysis of economic data.
Software for most econometric analyses that should be included in the packages which the Centre is producing is already available from academic sources.
The Centre's main effort therefore is concentrated on developing a particularly friendly and convenient user interface for this software and arranging good and clear presentation of results.
The Centre will be producing two general purpose packages, one for the management and analysis of time series data and the other for use with cross-sectional data.
The packages will be available on the popular micro-computers and mainframes.
The design of the time series package is complete and work on developing the various programs in the package is well advanced.
The first few programs are scheduled for completion during the summer of 1986.
They will provide facilities for accessing important data bases such as those produced by the Central Statistical Office and the Bank of England, the management of the user's own data base, the display of data and a number of analyses including various regression methods, two and three stage least squares, full information maximum likelihood and Kalman filters.
The Centre's resources are now fully taken up with the activities described above.
As work on the time series package is completed it will be possible to start work on programs for use with cross-sectional data where a vital requirement is for flexible facilities for managing data and preparing it for analysis.
It is anticipated that the Centre will look to the Package X statistical system to provide the data management facilities and concentrate on the econometric analyses that are required.
Package X is owned by Her Majesty's Government and already has the required high standard of friendly user interface.
The Centre's activities in this area will concentrate on providing the appropriate user interface for already available software for econometric analysis, and establishing required links with Package X. In addition, in co-operation with the ESRC Data Archive, the Centre is particularly anxious to provide software for accessing the publicly available data bases such as the General Household Survey and the Family Expenditure Survey for use with Package X and the Centre's software.

Much current research in the social sciences involves close observation over time of the behaviour of a small number of individuals.
Investigations take place both in natural settings, such as in schools or with families, as well as in the psychological laboratory.
Statistical methods of analysing the large amounts of data which can arise from such studies are at present inadequate.
Standard techniques may be used to make broad comparisons between groups of individuals but the statistical analysis of changes over time and interrelationships between events, topics often of special interest to the psychologist, is much less well understood.
The purpose of this project is to develop appropriate statistical procedures, to test them using psychological data and to make available techniques for use by social scientists.
A key component of the project consists of the analysis of data, already available, from three psychological experiments for which a number of time-related statistical hypotheses are of interest.

Q-analysis was introduced into the social sciences about a decade ago, as a new research methodology and framework for thought.
To a greater extent than with other mathematically-based research tools there has been much difference of opinion as to its relevance and utility.
The research aims to explore the potential of the methodology of
Q-analysis as a tool of geographical inquiry.
This includes
(i)
re-examining and evaluating existing applications of the approach with a view to bringing out what has been achieved that could not have been derived by other methods
(ii)
applying the approach in new contexts, where data are already available, and evaluating their utility, in some cases in comparison with more popular methods of data analysis
(iii)
bringing out how Q-analysis both differs from and complements specific examples of more traditional styles of mathematical modelling in human geography.

Increasing use is being made of the telephone for interviewing the general public in market research and social surveys.
Issues of feasibility and data quality have been addressed in earlier research supported by the ESRC, with generally encouraging results.
The current research looks at more detailed issues arising in the selection of samples for telephone surveys.
The main focus will be on ex-directory numbers, which mean that published directories are incomplete as listings of telephone-owning households.
This problem has been faced by researchers in the United States but has been largely ignored in the United Kingdom.
One reason for this is lack of awareness of the scale of the problem and the research will start by documenting this in terms of the incidence of ex-directory numbers.
It will move on to seek a solution, using the approach well-developed elsewhere, of Random Digit Dialing.
Other issues to be examined will be those involved in randomly selecting a person to be interviewed within a household and problems arising in mixed surveys where non telephone owners are interviewed face-to-face.
The research will involve experimental interviewing, using the services of three market research companies who are also supporting the programme.
This will be used to learn more about how the British public use and feel about the telephone and, hence, about the acceptability of telephone interviewing.

Since the late 1970's there has been something of a boom in British Rail's passenger services, with over 150 new stations having been opened and several new services developed.
However, British Rail have not yet developed a suitable systematic approach for predicting the demand for new, or radically improved services.
The aim of this project is, therefore to develop forecasting approaches that are suitable for predicting the usage of new rail services.
The accuracy and costs of a number of different approaches will be assessed.
A manual of advice on how best to forecast the demand for new rail services of various types will then be prepared.
It is proposed that half of the project's time will be funded by case study work.
Work from British Rail and three local authorities is already forthcoming, whilst additional studies are being sought.
This project builds on previous work, carried out between 1982 and 1985 as a Research Studentship funded by the Science and Engineering COuncil and British Rail, on new stations in West Yorkshire.
It also aims to consolidate recent work carried out to assess the potential for new rail services between Leicester and Burton (Funded by Leicestershire County Council) and Nottingham and Worksop (Funded by Nottinghamshire County Council).

The computer revolution has had a profound effect on the mathematics associated with the analysis of computer programs.
It has become clear that the majority of computer tasks required by scientific and commercial applications share many properties and these properties can be analysed mathematically.
Fortunately there is a great deal of similarity between the mathematics developed for this task and the techniques required to analyse certain types of data.
Sociological data is usually analysed by grouping together common attributes such as social class, educational background, etc.
However, for smaller data sets an alternative approach is possible and we can look directly at relationships between individuals.
For example, it is possible to construct a network of friends drawn from a school class room, and to analyse this data using mathematical techniques.
It is these techniques which have much in common with the analysis of computer programs.
The aim of this research is to apply the methods developed for computer algorithms design and analysis to social networks.
Not only should this make network analysis more efficient, but should increase potential for looking at larger data sets on smaller (and hence cheaper) computers.
In addition to sociological data and so increase the number of methods available to researchers.

In the current political climate, with the state sector steadily withdrawing from the provision of public services and the private sector providing alternatives only where there is a possibility of profit, the third sector of the economy, that of charitable organisations, becomes increasingly important.
Yet charities' resources are often severely limited and funding in this sector is notoriously precarious.
The research aims to make use of a unique source of data in order to extend our understanding of patterns and determinants of individual charitable giving, and to examine policy options available to charitable organisations wishing to increase their receipts from individual donors.
The data comes from the Charity Household Survey, which originated in 1985 when Charities Aid Foundation and a consortium of nine other major British charities commissioned a small market research company to design the survey.
So far, three annual surveys have been conducted, in 1985/86, 1987, and 1988/89, each based on a sample of nearly 1,000 households in Britain.
Information has been collected on households' patterns of donating money and volunteering time to charities, individuals' motives for giving, their attitudes to charities, and their knowledge of and views of covenanting and bequeathing money to charities.
All this data is to be subject to intensive analysis.

Multilevel modelling is a relatively recent technique which has found increasing application in the social sciences.
Unlike previous statistical modelling procedures, for example based upon linear regression, these new models take full account of the hierarchical structure of most social systems.
They have been extensively used in education to study the manner in which educational institutions such as schools vary and the factors which explain such variation.
They have been used with great success in the analysis of repeated measures data and ar increasingly coming to be used to efficiently analyse complex sample surveys.
The project will build upon existing knowledge in the following ways.
Firstly, it will disseminate these new procedures to the social science community by means of newsletters workshops and computer software.
These dissemination procedures were a feature of an earlier project supported by the ESRC and the present project will pay particular attention to developing software which can be easily understood and used by social scientists.
Secondly, the project will develop further application of these models in the social sciences.
Some of the areas which will be tackled include the analysis of spatial data, the analysis of time series data the analysis of discrete response data including the use of linear models and a study of measurement error.
Thirdly, the project will aim to collaborate with individual social scientists in the analysis of their data sets.
The project will also acquire an archive of data sets suitable for teaching and demonstration.
Finally, the project aims to produce a comprehensive manual describing the techniques to go with the ML3 software being developed.
At the same time it is proposed to develop an knowledge enhancement system as part of the software to help and guide users.

There has been, in the last decade, a growing awareness of the importance of the geometric viewpoint in the fundamental analysis of statistics.
In particular the branch of geometry which studies any smooth curved surface, which is known as differential geometry, has been applied with great success and has produced both new insights into correct statistical theory and has also produced many important new results.
We refer in particular to the works of Amari and Barndorff- Nielsen.
The researchers have been working in this area and have produced a new kind of geometric structure which is particularly appropriate to use in statistical theory.
This is called a Preferred Point Geometry.
The new structure throws considerable light on the current theories of geometry in statistics.
Part of the project therefore will be spent developing the theory behind this new geometric approach and in producing one single geometric theory which extends the currently fragmented literature.
The second part of the project involves using the new insights which preferred point geometry offers to make practical the methods which both the new and existing theories produce.
In particular applications are envisaged to the following important areas of econometrics: non-tested hypothesis testing (encompassing tests), misspecification analysis, model discrimination and influence analysis.

In recent decades there have been substantial changes in the family and household experiences of people in Britain, especially in the 1980s.
These have been due to evolving patterns of co-residence related to the decline in marriage and increases in cohabitation and breakdown of both formal and informal sexual unions.
There has also been an increased propensity for people to live alone.
The research project will investigate these evolving patterns in a life course context to describe the experiences of different groups over time, and to attempt to explain the factors which have been responsible for these changes.
The analysis will be based mainly on the use of large-scale survey data, both cross-sectional and longitudinal such as the General Household Survey and the Child Development Study, although some cross-national comparisons will also be undertaken.

There is increasing interest among social scientists in the linking of data from different sources, including the national census of population based on a system of enumeration districts (EDs).
In contrast, electoral administration is based on a different zonal system of geographically-defined wards, made up of ‘polling districts’(PDs) which are not precisely defined in spatial terms.
The research has aimed to assess the match of PD geography with that of the census.
With this knowledge, electoral behaviour may be related to local area social and economic characterisation.
The research has documented the extremely complex and in some ways confusing technology of electoral administration and the spatial basis by which it is organised.
The spatial units can be related to census areas in a number of ways, though none is judged to be very satisfactory.
Nevertheless, the research has identified ways in which a more systematic evaluation of polling districts and census zones can be achieved so that an integration of information about electoral behaviour and more general socio-economic information at the local level may be obtained.
The mechanisms to achieve this and an assessment of the errors involved are documented, together with an explanation of new and promising possibilities to relate polling districts and enumeration districts that can exploit the increased use of postcodes by the 1991 census.

This study related to the statistical measurement of tourism as covered by surveys of visitors to tourist attractions, tourist destinations and at passenger termini.
Within most sample surveys of visitors, data on the size and composition of groups (eg a family group of size 4) are collected.
Information derived from these is used in a variety of ways, but most frequently in contributing towards a base for decision-making in the areas of planning and marketing.
It is therefore important that the procedure used to produce a sample of visitors is not biased by size of group.
Otherwise not only will results concerning group size and composition be misleading, but results involving any variable that is related to size of group are likely to be inaccurate.
The research will examine the behaviour of visitors with regard to group activity and movement within areas commonly used for interview.
A mix of personal interviews and observation methods will be employed.
Mathematical models will be constructed in order to quantify errors that result bias due to group size.
Finally, recommendations will be made relating to the selection of interviewees and the analysis of visitor surveys.

Panel surveys involve repeated observations of subjects so as to build up a longitudinal record of the events of interest.
For example, this could be an employment history, marital and childbearing history or medical history.
Interest centres on how long a subject stays in a particular state (e.g. unemployed, married without children) and how this length of time is affected by characteristics of the subject.
Various methods of analysis have been developed for such data.
It is well known that survey data is subject to a variety of sources of measurement error such as misreporting, recall errors and telescoping of past incidents to give a false historical record.
The research project will involve the development of statistical theory and numerical investigations to explore the impact of measurement errors in the methods of panel analysis.
If these impacts are severe then alternative methods of analysis which are more robust to measurement error will be sought.

The primary purpose of the ESRC Data Archive is to acquire, ‘clean’, catalogue and distribute computer-readable data for the purpose of research by social scientists in universities, the public service and elsewhere.
It is also concerned with the quality of new data and the secondary analysis of existing ones, and to that end arranges conferences and seminars concerned with its holdings and publishes a Bulletin.
It is associated with a number of current and planned research projects, although in the past it has not been the practice to undertake substantive research directly.
However, the Archive carries out considerable research into various aspects of information storage and retrieval which are vital to the efficient processing of machine-readable social science data.
During the past year, the Archive has continued its programme of research in information science and technology in a number of ways.
It has conducted an assessment of the various statistical packages for the manipulation and analysis of large-scale hierarchical data sets and has applied some of this work to the dissemination of very large, government-generated data sets (see below).
The Archive has also continued the process of investigating the most effective methods of describing and facilitating access to quantitative social science data.
A thesaurus suitable for such data has been constructed.
Much of this work takes place in combination with the Archive's continuing programme of data acquisition and data dissemination.
The Archive has developed its collaboration with government departments, first initiated through the Archive's work in disseminating the Department of Employment's Joint Unemployment Vacancy Office Statistics (JUVOS) to Local Authorities, with work on the dissemination of census data to schools and, very recently, the construction of a Rural Areas Database sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment, and a number of public agencies.
During 1985/86 the Archive was working on a major contract to the BBC for the provision of data for the Domesday Project — a commemoration of the 900th anniversary of the Domesday Book to be released on video-disk by the BBC in December 1986.
The aim of the disks will be to present as complete a statistical portrayal as possible of Britain during the 1980s and the Archive has supplied national level data mainly from the large-scale Government generated reference surveys for one of the video-disks.
The BBC sees these disks as being widely available in schools, libraries and in the home.
The involvement of the Archive in a venture of this kind has represented a new departure in the dissemination of its holdings.
There is also a possibility that this collaboration with the BBC may be a continuing one.
The Rural Areas Database brings together from the very many existing sources, data which relate to the changing countryside.
This includes agricultural data, socio-economic data and data on the natural environment.

Information Technology (IT) is a strategic resource not just because it provides sophisticated operational systems and day-to-day information for management control but also because associated Information Systems (IS) provide top level market information.
However, organisations are not sure how successful their IT investments have been.
Benefits from operational systems can be measured, although not easily and not many organisations carry out thorough evaluations.
Benefits from information are more difficult to assess.
Further uncertainty results because IS can have impacts across companies which are linked by virtue of adding value to a product.
In other words an IS needs to be analysed in the context of a value chain.
Only in this way can opportunities for vertical integration and strategic cooperation between organisations be investigated.
There has been little research to evaluate IT and IS and how they effect the top levels of organisations.
This project is directed at these concerns and deals with management, not technical, issues.
The project is centred on retail value chains and its objectives are to: 1.
Audit the development of US within two contrasting retail value chains.
2.
Develop a framework to analyse the role of IS. 3.
Assess the use of information in retail value chains.
4.
Compare retailing with other sectors where IT has been used extensively.
5.
Predict the trend of future developments.

The theory of reliability is well-developed for conventional tests, which aim to assess individuals relative to others in some population.
It is less so for criterion-referenced testing, which attempts to produce an absolute, rather than a relative, measurement.
The assessment of the National Curriculum is an example of criterion-referenced testing, in which pupils area awarded levels from 1 to 10 on a number of ‘Attainment Targets’ based on present criteria known as ‘Statements of Attainment’.
Performance measured relative to these statements is aggregated using complex rules to derive the level awarded.
There are many sources of unreliability in this procedure, and measures used for traditional tests are not appropriate.
This project will investigate some of the technical issues in measuring the reliability of such criterion-referenced assessments.
Data from National Curriculum pilot testing will be used, as well as simulated data.
While the National Curriculum will be the particular application of interest, it is envisaged that the results will have application to criterion-referenced testing generally.

The focus of the research is the design and development of a prototype Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) for emergency planning purposes.
The particular type of emergency to be addressed is the evacuation of population from major potential disaster areas such as the environs of nuclear power stations or chemical works.
The SDSS will model the evacuation process on a computer and allow emergency planners to determine the effects on the evacuation of different strategies in their emergency plan and the effects of incidents such as vehicle breakdowns and accidents.
The system will combine Operational Research techniques such as simulation with the spatial data handling tools and graphics capabilities of Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
The prototype will be applied initially to the area around Heysham Nuclear Power stations, but the software will be written so that the system can use any information stored in the GIS data base.
The researchers are drawn from the ESRC's North West Regional Research and Operations Management.

Instruction of research students in research methods and techniques has received government attention for almost a decade.
Besides the Swinnerton-Dyer and Rothschild Reports of 1982 (Cmnd 8537 and Cmnd 8554, respectively), the topic has also been addressed by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (1985) and by the ESRC (1989).
It is widely accepted that new members of the research community deserve careful initiation, socialisation and accreditation.
Yet, over the same period, research training has fallen under another shadow.
The epistemological foundations of educational research have also been the subject of intensive scrutiny.
In short, educational inquiry has entered the era of post-newtonianism, post-positivism, post-structuralism, post-modernism…
The proposed seminars are convened at the intersection of methodology and epistemology.
And they will focus upon three topics:
(1)
Recent developments in the epistemology and methodology of the social sciences;
(2)
the relevance of such ideas to educational inquiry; and
(3)
their significance for the training of educational researchers.

A Geographical Information System (GIS) is a computer-based system for the display and processing of geographical data, often in the form of computer-generated maps.
Maps, like any other for of data, can profitably be analysed using statistical methods.
Also, many new methods for analysing maps have been developed in the last decade and the UK is a world leader in this field of spatial statistics.
However, existing GIS's largely fail to exploit the possibilities for statistical analysis of the data which they display.
The research aims to fill this gap.
Reflecting local interests and expertise, the project will focus on the analysis of point maps, and will emphasise applications to the geographical distribution of disease.
This presents an opportunity to contribute to an important issue of social policy — the pattern of association between disease, especially childhood cancer, and sources of environmental pollution.
On the technical side, the project will include a comparative assessment of two different strategies: adding statistical capability to a commercially available GIS, and writing a GIS module within a general statistical computing environment.

Much social research and public debate concerns quantities like quality of life or attitude to abortion which are not susceptible to direct measurement.
Such Quantities are known as latent variables and they include human abilities and attitudes as well as collective characteristics of society such as business confidence.
Construction of suitable measurement scales for latent variables is a vital part of basic social research and a necessary step in the exploration of relationships between them.
This kind of research has a long history in psychology and education but is relatively undeveloped in the rest of social science.
The research programme has two aspects.
One is the development of new methodology.
This involves establishing mathematical links between so-called indicators, which can be directly observed, and the latent variable.
The second aspect os the development of user-friendly software to implement the methods.
Allowance must be made for the fact that the raw data will not always have been sampled randomly, and that some data will be missing and that the indicators will often be different kinds of variable.
The work will be conducted in collaboration with colleagues in related fields at the Institute of Education and the City University.

The project brings together recent developments in computational statistics and high-performance computing to make these widely available to research workers for the analysis of large and complex datasets.
The estimation of components of variance plays an important part in the analysis of multi-level datasets.
Components of variance are needed to obtain efficient estimates of mean effects; to provide valid estimates of standard errors; and to identify the magnitude of sources of variation in surveys.
This project takes a general estimation procedure know as Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) and implements it on the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre's (EPCC) Connection Machine.
Remote access to the facility will be provided to users wishing to analyse large datasets.
Training material will also be prepared on the application of REML and the use of EPCC facilities.
Although this type of analysis is most strongly developed in the physical sciences, nevertheless the methods are important to all fields of scientific endeavour.
The project should lead to increasing awareness across disciplines of techniques that have found many successful applications in the physical sciences.

1.
Methods for the basic policy formulation problem
The policy optimization methods developed by PROPE and its predecessor PREM have aimed to meet the requirements of economists and policymakers who have advocated the need for such methods.
These methods have proved to be very effective in policy design.
2.
Methods of model validation
For some time, optimal control has been considered as a powerful method for analysing and solving problems in optimal policy formulation.
However optimal control techniques can also be used to analyse the dynamic behaviour of economic systems as well as being used as a method for testing the validity of a model.
The aim of the research is to develop such tests.
The research will concentrate on the possibility of systematizing and standardising a procedure that seems to emerge from experience hitherto with econometric models.
3.
Methods for utilizing alternative model specifications
Since there are usually at least two competing theories for the explanation of an economic relationship, and statistical analysis techniques are not robust enough to allow the rejection of one theory in favour of another, it is inevitable that more than one possible underlying structure may be taken to represent the economic system.
Clearly, this creates problems in the design of economic policy.
A number of approaches, involving the exploitation of alternative models, will be investigated.
To study the effects of economic policy actions with respect to the major European economies with apparent consequences for the European Monetary System, there is analysis of the behaviour of the UK, Federal Republic of Germany, France and Italy vis- ‘a-vis the rest of the world.
4.
Software for large-scale econometric models
The main aim of a modelling language is to establish in computer terms a rational environment in which the complex methodology for policy design and model analysis can be implemented.
In particular, the evaluation of model derivatives and the use of more than one model simultaneously would only be possible for large systems within such a framework.
Clearly, a readily available and easily understandable representation of the model would also help the economic analysis entailed by the complex methodology of policy and model analysis.

This project will address specifically identified methodological questions of a statistical nature that arise in the analysis of existing large and complex labour market data sets.
The data sets to be analysed include the Youth Cohort Survey, The National Child Development Survey and a panel of worker absence histories.
Each of these data sets has complex features which result from the repeated sampling of the original respondents at various points in time.
This feature permits the investigation of a rich array of questions concerning individual's labour market decisions.
the policy questions to be focussed on include: 1) Unemployment among young people and the school to work transition.
2) Education and training of young people and educational investment by mature students.
3) Industrial Absenteeism. 4) Household labour supply, Female Labour market participation and work histories.
5) Job choice, Career Mobility and Labour Market discrimination.
The statistical and econometric methodological questions which are important in the context of the above data sets are concerned with would, and how, people stay in or leave the sample.
To what extent unobserved characteristics of individuals effect the interpretation and modelling of the data.
Also important is how to test for different interpretations of the data, and how to use data which is, possibly in different ways incomplete or missing.
All of these questions relate directly to the use of observed data with the latest computer software in commenting on and evaluating policy in the labour market.

Social scientists in France and Britain differ in the way in which they approach the analysis of survey data.
French investigators rely heavily on the analysis of correspondences.
British workers on the other hand use a wide range of statistical techniques, but hardly ever use correspondence analysis.
The purpose of this study is to collaborate with a similar research group in Paris to try to find out why these differences occur.
Are French social scientists interested in answering different types of questions from those posed by their British counterparts?
Are the philosophies of the data analysts different?
Should British social scientists be adopting French statistical methods or vice versa?
Would social surveys be better understood if both approaches to data analysis were to be adopted?
By re-analysing a few examples of French social survey data it is hoped that the British statisticians will become more familiar with French methods and also learn whether British methods would have revealed more or less details, or whether the two types of statistical methods are complementary.
Similarly, the French team will re-analyse a few examples of survey data collected by research workers at the Institute of Psychiatry.

The research finds effective ways of teaching a specific programming language, PROLOG, in the context of teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Why?
The techniques of AI are becoming more and more important, both in industry (eg in robotics and the intelligent use of databases) and in pure research in the cognitive sciences; but the techniques are essentially programming concepts and can only usefully be grasped by those who can program.
As people interested in cognitive studies come at least as much from linguistics, philosophy or psychology as from a computer-using subject, they must be introduced to programming.
One wants to be able to get students to the interesting theoretical problems, such as how to make sensible symbolic representations, as soon as possible.
Obviously one wants a language which enables this without demanding a lot of effort merely to be learnt and used at all.
The investigators believe that PROLOG achieves this exceptionally well, because of its flexible datastructuring; a control flow which needs very little attention from the programmer; and its simplicity and uniformity.
This project aims to answer the following questions:
— what is the best way to teach PROLOG to students both with and without prior programming experience?
— How do students conceive of what they are doing when they program in PROLOG?
and to
— Produce or improve teaching materials for PROLOG that assist both students and teachers
— Produce a programming environment for using PROLOG that both assists students and gives data about their understanding of PROLOG.
During the course of this research, the main thrust if the work was the development of the criteria needed for teaching about how Prolog executes a program.
The presentation of this virtual machine is termed a story.
A detailed story was constructed and refined to account for both the straightforward and more difficult aspects of Prolog.
Further contributions include a debugger, Coda (originally called Soda), and an analysis of the errors made by Prolog programmers.

Most health education and health promotion campaigns are based on the assumptions that individual lifestyles play an important role in experiences of health and disease, and that individual behaviour can be influenced by some combination of information, emotional appeal and suggestions for change.
However, little is known about the relationship between attitudes and beliefs and health-related behaviour.
Even in the case of smoking where some success has been achieved in persuading the public that smoking is undesirable, the reasons for success remain largely obscure.
Thus, although people do change their behaviour, habits, beliefs and lifestyles, why they do so is unclear.
Objectives
1 To gather information relating to behavioural change, health habits and perceived health in a sample of the Scottish population.
2 To ascertain the extent of behavioural change related to health in a specified community.
3 To develop a standardised indicator of behavioural/social change which may serve to measure such change in other communities.
Method
1 Initially, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a representative sample of the adult Scottish population.
2 The information from these interviews will be used to develop a structured interview schedule.
(The interview schedule will be reviewed from the standpoint of utility, reliability and validity by pre-testing on a small sample.)
3 A community will be selected and a sample interviewed using a questionnaire developed after
(2)
above.
4 The results of this interview will form the basis for the development of a standardised indicator of behavioural change.

One of the most important innovations in macroeconomic modelling during the last decade has been the development of continuous time econometric models.
In these models the economy is assumed to be adjusting continuously rather than moving in discrete jumps at intervals (annual or quarterly) corresponding to the available data.
Although continuous time econometric modelling is primary a British development the methods that were first used in modelling (in continuous time) the United Kingdom economy are now being used by leading research and forecasting groups throughout the world.
The aim of the research is to develop a powerful new estimation method which takes account of the exact mathematical relationship between the behaviour of the discrete data and the underlying continuous time model that is assumed to have generated that data.
The method will be applicable in very general circumstances including sample periods when the economy is initially very far from its steady state and even cases in which the model is dynamically unstable.
Its application is expected to result in a significant improvement in the predictive performance of continuous time econometric models and their reliability for policy analysis.

Many social scientists use computers in their research work and it is desirable that their computing should be as productive as possible.
From amongst factors that might improve productivity, this research investigates whether the use of personal work stations, rather than shared mainframe computers, would be beneficial.
Personal work stations are powerful computers used by one person at a time and linked to other machines for supporting services such as printing and data archiving.
They are equipped with high resolution visual display screens and, as well as keyboards, graphic input devices to allow users to communicate with their machines by pointing to information on the screens.
It is hoped that social scientists will not only be able to carry out with greater ease and rapidity those types of computation previously undertaken on mainframe computers but that they may also be able to take advantage of the machines’ ability to handle graphical information.
However, there may be difficulties in connection with aspects of data security, data communication, the provision of software, training and the organisation of advisory services.
The research aims, by controlling and monitoring the use of personal work stations for a selected range of social science research computing projects, to answer the question: to what extent should computing facilities for social scientists be provided by personal work stations?

There has been work going on for sometime in developing user friendly programs for statistical analysis which are ‘intelligent’ in that they include many checks for pitfalls and errors.
A program for survey analysis is being written, financed by a research grant from the Overseas Development Administration, and this program is currently on test in developing countries.
The objective of this research is to develop techniques to check and control erroneous data in survey analysis programs of the type just mentioned.
There are basically two ways of controlling erroneous data.
The first way is to use standard quality control techniques at the data input stage, so that the output of coders, data punchers, etc, has a controlled quality level.
The second way is to use systems of logical, arithmetic and statistical tests on the data once they are entered into a computer.
Some systems of tests are already in use in Government statistical organisations, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.
This research develops and extends these systems of tests, and incorporates expert system features into them.
Data quality is a very important issue, especially now that automatic recording devices are available, and the volumes of data handled are vast.
There could be applications of the work to numerous fields.

There has been interest recently, and published work, in the application of time series methods to data arising from repeated sample surveys.
This project concerns the application of such an approach to data from the British National Readership Survey.
The present project constitutes a pilot study after which it is hoped to set up a longer term project to follow up the initial findings.
The first aim of the project is to consider the best approach to use to estimate the readership of a particular magazine, for example, in the present month.
Smoothing methods are currently adopted here, and these are being assessed, prior to(possibly) recommending alternative approaches.
Beyond this, as time allows, the following topics are being addressed.
The short-term impact of, for example, the launch of a new magazine or a strike is being investigated through examination of the relationship between circulation and readership figures.
Prospects for long-term forecasting are being examined, with the aim of recommending the best approach to use.
It is anticipated that it will be possible to group magazines into different types, and to use these groupings in the forecasting procedure adopted.
The appropriate groupings are likely to result from the application of multivariate methods such as cluster analysis.

Distinct approaches to data analysis in Britain and France have developed independently over the last 10 years.
The British approach involves the use of an appropriate probability model within an inferential framework, whereas the French school favours correspondence analysis, which is an essentially descriptive technique for exploratory data analysis.
Although there are relationships between the two methods, the underlying philosophies are quite different.
The aim of this research is to compare the use of the two approaches in practice, on large datasets from various socio-economic sources.
This will highlight the respective advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and show how they can be used to complement one another in the analysis and presentation of large complex datasets.
This joint ESRC/CNRS project between the Centre for Applied Statistics and the Laboratoire de Statistique et Probabilit'es, Universit'e Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, also aims to improve communication between British and French statisticians and prevent the further entrenchment of their ideas.
This will be achieved through a number of exchange visits and a series of workshops in each country.
These workshops will be for people involved in particular aspects of analysing socio-economic data and will consist of presentations of the different approaches illustrated with the results of the comparative analyses of relevant datasets.

Quantitative research in education and other areas of social science has traditionally adapted statistical methods developed in other areas, eg agriculture and medicine.
Apart from the well known problem of casual interferences from non-experimental data, another important, less well known difficulty lies with the complex hierarchical structure of many social systems.
Thus, most survey data have such a structure, having been sampled in several stages, eg via constituencies, households within constituencies and individuals within households.
In education, there is an explicit hierarchy of LEAs, schools, classes and children.
In fitting statistical models to study relationships, it is important to take account of such hierarchies, both for technical reasons but also because influential factors can be present at any or all levels of aggregation.
Thus, for example, children's achievement may be related not only to their own social background but also to the social background of their classroom, characteristics of the school, etc.
Indeed much of the weakness of recent educational research can be traced to a failure to take account of such factors.
The research project explores the substantive and technical issues of analysing hierarchical structures and in particular develops general purpose computer software.

Sample surveys are now a very common part of life and they are used in market research, in government administration, and so on.
Much of the statistical analysis of surveys of this kind involves tabulations such as a cross-tabulation of age, social class, a percentage unemployed in different areas.
However, frequently, the kind of questions we want to ask of the data are deeper than would be answered simply by looking at a cross-tabulation.
For example, one may have a hypothesis about the outcomes and one wishes to test whether the data are consistent with this.
Methods for statistical analysis applied, say, to a designed experiment, are not applicable to surveys because frequently a sample survey involves a very complicated structure and this gives rise to considerable problems in the statistical analysis.
The aim of this project is to investigate these problems and to come up with suggested methods of analysis which are generally applicable to complex surveys.
This work arose out of a project in which a sample survey program was written specifically for use by developing countries.

Many studies in the social sciences involve the collection of quantitative data.
A powerful and flexible statistical method of analysing such data is the so-called generalised linear model; this offers many advantages over the better known traditional ‘regression’ techniques.
However, the generality of the technique poses problems; often there may be no a priori reason for choosing one of the available generalisations as opposed to another.
This project aims to develop further the work of the investigators and to provide simple programs in the GLIM language for the use of social scientists.

We live in a society where a mass of information is collected for administrative purposes.
Present day historians use preserved records to produce a picture of past societies, but such records have often been kept in an ad hoc way, thus limiting the use of the information.
With the advent of computers enabling researchers to process large amounts of data, such research is likely to increase in the future.
Work therefore needs to be done to ensure that administrative records are retained sensibly, since it would be impossible to preserve every piece of information for ever.
The aim of this research is to devise a sampling system for one particular kind of record: supplementary benefit records, while keeping in mind the wider issues concerned with data preservation.
The Public Records Office currently retains some supplementary benefit records but there is no systematic sampling system.
The researchers will meet with current historians to find out what use they make of past records with the aim of anticipating the requirements of future historians.
In addition, the researchers will visit DHSS offices, in order that the sampling scheme is one which DHSS staff find practical.

Scientific Information Retrieval (SIR) is a computer package designed for the analysis of large scale, complex, social surveys.
Social researchers, especially those who are not experienced programmers, find difficulty in using this package, although by using it they are able to carry out analyses which, using conventional packages, are almost impossible.
This teaching package is designed to introduce social researchers with minimal computing expertise to SIR.
The package consists of a work-book and a data-set which, used together, will enable the researcher to follow worked examples for which each stage of the analysis is explained.

The Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) at City University is to provide the focus for a research programme into individual and household change using data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys' (OPCS) Longitudinal Study (LS).
Since the mid 1970s this source has brought together information from census and vital registration records for a one per cent sample of the population of England and Wales.
These records are being used in studies of differentials in mortality, cancer incidence and survival, migration, bereavement and social mobility.
The recent addition of information from the 1981 Census provides a unique opportunity for studies of socio-economic and demographic change for 500,000 individuals and households.
The ‘10-year on’ programme will cover work on occupational and social mobility, on geographic change and migration, on family and household formation and housing change, on ageing and on immigrants.
Researchers with an interest in the subject matter of the programme are encouraged to contact SSRU who have been given resources under the programme to support a range of projects conducted by people from outside SSRU.

Economic forecasting
Forecasting is very important in a variety of fields, including economics, business and marketing.
There is a rich variety of different forecasting procedures, and it is now generally accepted that no one method is ‘best’ in every situation, but rather that the choice depends on various practical considerations.
Univariate (or projection) forecasts arise when forecasts of a given time series (such as successive monthly sales of a particular product) depend only on present and past observations of the given series.
Such methods are widely used in practice.
Many theoretical and practical problems remain to be studied and this research project will tackle some of them.
Theoretical work will concentrate on comparing methods for estimating and/or adjusting for trend and seasonality.
Empirical work will concentrate on comparing different methods on many different real data sets.
In particular, the project will study a method called the Holt-Winters procedure, and examine ways of choosing smoothing parameters and starting values for the automatic version of the procedure, as well as testing a non-automatic version which allows subjective adjustment in regard to such features as outliers.
Methods of constructing prediction intervals will also be examined.

The aim of PROPE is to investigate optimization and control methods for macroeconomic policy design.
The group's recent research has led to a general policy optimization framework for large macroeconomic models.
This approach has been successfully used with a number of well known models of the UK economy, including the models of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the London Business School and HM Treasury.
Some of the methods developed for policy optimization have been installed by PROPE on the computers of HM Treasury to be used with research work on the Treasury model.
These methods have also been used by PROPE in the memoranda of evidence prepared for the enquiries of the House of Commons Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service.
Current research aims to cover the following five areas:
(i)
the development of methods for the basic policy optimization problem.
These include general inequality constrained non-linear optimization methods for large, non-linear, econometric models; determination of parameterised control (feedback) laws and robust control methods in the presence of rational expectations.
(ii)
The development of policy design methods under model uncertainty.
These include methodsfor computing various minimax strategies and game theory methods in the presence of rival models representing the economic system.
(iii)
The development of software for large scale econometric models.
(iv)
Methods for model validation.
(v)
the maintenance and operation of HM Treasury model, as the most realistic model of the UK economy, for implementing PROPE's policy optimization studies.

Graphical models are a new tool in the kitbag of applied statistical analysis.
They provide a systematic means of unravelling complex patterns of interaction in multivariate response data.
The underlying pattern is modelled by an independence graph which possesses the remarkable Markov property that any two variables that are not directly connected are independent conditional on only their separating set.
The path diagrams of the geneticist Sewell Wright, are a special case.
The theory is based on the underlying concept of conditional independence which applies equally to discrete data summarised in the form of contingency tables and to continuous data summarised by regression and correlation coefficients.
Because of their simplicity and power, these models promise to systematise the analysis of multiple response data arising from social surveys.
The project will help to put on several workshops on the application of Graphical Models to survey analysis.
This is a cooperative venture with the University of Copenhagen's Computing Centre and the first workshops will be put on in Copenhagen and Lancaster next June.
It is hoped that the Lancaster workshop will make use of a new statistical laboratory equipped with Whitechapel workstations.

Considerable work has been carried out on methods for analysing and modelling individual time series of observations.
These methods have been relatively successful in the practical area of forecasting economic and social time series.
Modelling several series at the same time is more appropriate in certain circumstances.
However, the issues raised are more complex and the subject area is less well developed.
The research aims to develop new methods of multivariate time series modelling.
The approach taken is a structural one, in which individual components in the series, such as trends and seasonals, are modelled explicitly.
The models may be extended to include observable explanatory variables and simultaneity can be allowed for as in econometric models.
The class of models to be considered provides link between conventional time series and econometric models.
It is hoped that the methodology developed will aid both our understanding of economic and social time series, and will enable them to be forecasted more accurately.

In the statistical analysis of economic data, assumptions are made about the way time series evolve, about the characteristics of the population from which a cross-sectional sample is drawn, and about the nature of the relationships between variables.
Generally, the stronger the assumptions upon which the analysis is founded, the more reliable the conclusions reached, if the assumptions are reasonable.
Sometimes they are unreasonable, perhaps being arbitrary or made for convenience's sake; if so, to what extent are conclusions invalidated, and can one proceed in an alternative fashion based on only weak knowledge?
The project investigates how the validity and reliability of new and existing econometric procedures are affected by various departures from the usual assumptions.
This entails study of three approaches to econometric analysis: the ‘parametric’, where relatively strong assumptions are made, and relatively precise conclusions can be drawn; the ‘nonparametric’, where the assumptions are vague and the conclusions imprecise; and the ‘adaptive’, which falls somewhere in between in respect of the assumptions made, but attempts to rival the parametric approach in the nature of its conclusions.
The work should have relevance both to macroeconomic and microeconomic data.

Air transport is used much less in the rest of the United Kingdom than in the South East.
It is difficult to know whether this is due to there being little need to fly or whether it is due to lack of opportunity.
This is because the characteristics of a region's economy and the supply of air transport usually change slowly and hand-in-hand with one another.
In the USA, domestic airlines choose hubs for their operations at smalltown airports whose natural characteristics would never justify the high level of air transport now available to them.
The services are often put into operation very quickly.
It is intended to use the information available on a commercial data system to study the changes in local air transport use and the local economy as a result of the very large increases in flight frequencies and direct destinations.
The actual local air traffic will be compared with the level which would have been expected by natural growth as predicted by a successful Federal Aviation Administration model.
Improved models will be built which include the effects of frequency, number of direct destinations and the type of local economy.
This will help decide the value of aviation policies which encourage regional services.

The objective of this research is to consolidate, systematise and generalise our (previously separate) experience of conducting experimental investigations into economic behaviour under uncertainty, thereby furthering the use of experimental methods in economics.
The investigators are conducting a co-ordinated and intensive programme of work which should produce the following benefits:
(a)
to increase substantially the quality and range of experimental tools and to use them with larger samples of participants to provide more powerful tests and more direct evidence about alternative models of economic decision-making;
(b)
to generate a significant volume of experimental data of a crucially different kind from that normally available to economists, which should reveal fresh insights into economic behaviour and stimulate further theoretical advances;
(c)
to lay the human and physical foundations for a centre of experimental economics in the UK which we hope will come to compare favourably with such centres in other countries, and which may encourage greater awareness and wider use of experimental methods by economists as a supplement to their usual research activities.
The research area of decision-making under uncertainty is one in which conventional types of economic data and standard econometric techniques have limited value.
There is no shortage of theoretical models suggesting how agents might act, or should act, in the face of risk and uncertainty, but it is a great deal more difficult to find evidence which really helps us to understand and explain how agents actually do act.
The investigators are therefore particularly concerned to design controlled trials which help to reveal how agents react to and deal with uncertainty: how they balance and evaluate different probabilities and outcomes; how expectations and aspiration levels are formed and revised; what information is sought, and what use is made of it.
The investigators believe that the answers to these questions are of fundamental importance for all of economics.

The Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) has for some time been worried that British spending on civil science, especially within the higher education sector, may not be adequate to enable the country to remain internationally competitive.
This project aims to provide solid evidence as to whether Britain is indeed out of line with other advanced industrial societies by comparing its pattern of spending on academic and academically related research with that of France, Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and the United States.
Data are collected for nine major fields of research (eg engineering and social sciences), broken down into 46 sub-fields (eg chemical engineering and sociology).
As well as comparing overall spending, figures are being prepared on both general funds for academic research (UGC-type finance) and separately budgeted research (equivalent to that funded by the Research Councils).
Figures are being compiled for 1975, 1980 and 1982 so that trends in patterns of spending can be established.
A final report on all six countries will be completed by the end of February 1986.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) is responsible for science policy because of its role as a principal source of advice to the Secretary of State on the allocation of the DES science budget.
The ABRC is now spending £100,000 a year on studies to support its own activities.
The ESRC's interest in this field derives from the fact that most of the research questions which arise, whether they concern basic research or policy analysis, require a major contribution from social scientists.
They can ask questions as part of the academic community, but outside the scientific community: they are well placed to raise questions that might otherwise not even be asked, and provide answers.
In July 1984, the Council agreed to finance a programme of research in science policy, which included research on long-term issues concerned with basic science.
The aim is to provide the kind of understanding necessary for improved policy analysis in the future and £100,000 a year was set aside for this programme.
Besides this direct funding of research, the Council believes that it can make a more general contribution to the development of science and technology policy.

Two pervasive problems for empirical work in economics are the lack of controlled experiments and of large samples of data, so that it is difficult to discriminate between competing theories using conventional methods and the available data.
This project is concerned with the development and analysis of model selection and testing techniques.
The emphasis in econometric research until recently has been on developing estimators with desirable large sample properties for correctly specified models.
The aim of the project is to analyse the properties of estimators and test statistics for both large and small samples in mis-specified as well as correctly specified models.
For example, it is important to know what properties an estimator or test statistic, which is known to have good properties if we happen to have chosen the correct model, will have for models with particular types of mis-specification.
In addition, apparently unrelated and contradictory theories appear to coexist in economics, and given the nature of economic data it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish between such theories using classical statistical methods.
Hence part of the project will be concerned to develop methods for discriminating between models in such situations.
However, the best way of doing this is not simply to develop important new methods and techniques, but also to make them accessible to applied workers.
Hence the project will include empirical work associated with some of the applied economics research being undertaken by other members of the Economics Department at Southampton.
Therefore, this project in addition to providing results of importance for econometric theory, should provide methods of importance for modelling strategies in economics and related disciplines, and so make a contribution towards improving the average standard of empirical research.

The research aims to investigate some of the social psychological factors that have helped to maintain the present conflict.
These psychological factors are being examined in two
(1)
a series of small scale laboratory studies attempt to isolate the impact of particular aspects of the social environment there — these include religious affiliation, political allegiance and national allegiance.
(2)
A series of interviews are being held with politically active people from a wide range of political parties and groupings in Northern Ireland.
The results of the interviews allied with a socio-historical examination of the background to the conflict will allow for the examination of ideologies in Northern Ireland, where an ideology is seen as a set of ideas held by a group of people that helps to structure their social world and guide their activity within that social world.

The use of children to tutor other children has been widely acknowledged as a successful teaching strategy in a variety of curriculum and ex-curriculum subjects.
It is claimed that children of similar ages inevitably approach problems from similar perspectives and therefore appreciate the learning difficulties that each other have.
It is further argued that child tutors are, by comparison with adult teachers, more sensitive to and aware of misunderstanding in other children.
However, contradictory evidence from research into cognitive growth suggests that children often fail to recognise when an instruction or lesson is ambiguous or incomplete.
This might lead to the assumption that they are less sensitive to others' misunderstanding than are adults.
The primary research aim is to examine processes involved in peer tutoring.
Specifically the studies compared the approaches of adults and children of varying ages to a tutoring task: teaching styles and tutor participation in the learning tasks were examined.
Child tutors' sensitivity to lack of understanding on the part of their tutees was also explored.
Several types of task and methodologies were employed, spanning five specific studies.
In studies 1, 2, and 3 children were tested on an animal classification task (1 and 2) and on a construction task
(3)
, tutors operating under differently specified tutoring roles.
In study 4 children watched a tutoring dyad performing a spatial task and responded to the tutee's verbal and non-verbal cues signalling the lack of understanding.
Study 5 involved a collaborative problem-solving task in which children ordered, in sequence, the segments of strip cartoon stories.
Results were related to two theoretical issues: children's implicit theory of teaching and children's sensitivity to misunderstanding.

Many tasks performed in the office necessitate reading, and are frequently carried out in noisy environments.
A substantial component of the noise normally comprises speech sounds which are irrelevant to both the task and the individual.
At a practical level, therefore, the research aims to identify those physical characteristics of the irrelevant speech eg, meaning, intensity, number of sources, rhythm, that cause disruption to the reading.
It appears that only particular components of the reading process are susceptible to impairment by the irrelevant speech, and the research aims to specify these.
The theoretical component of the work involves identifying the stage
(s)
in the human attentional system at which the disruption may act.
The effects are plausibly perceptually based, memory based, or due to some combination of each.
Identifying the location of the disruption should aid the development of current models of attention.
The outcome of the investigations will allow recommendations to be made concerning the office environment, and also shed light on the linked human processes of attention, memory and reading.

In the past, it was thought that language began when the child uttered the first word, but we now know that it begins with the first interactions and communication shortly after birth.
A key development in the first few months of life is ‘joint reference’: the ability of a young baby to follow mother's eye-gaze in order that they can jointly experience the same event.
For deaf babies this is a problem: in theory, break the eye-gaze, communication stops and joint reference cannot occur.
Hearing parents of deaf children frequently report problems of attention and eye-gaze.
However, in the investigators' study of deaf mothers and their infants they have begun to see that the mothers create the crucial joint reference naturally but differently by altering their own sign language.
They will make signs beside the object at the point of the child's eye-gaze, and they will even sign with the child in their laps so that each turn and movement of their bodies is transmitted to the child.
The investigators have begun a follow-up study of eight babies from the age of 2 months to establish the pattern of development in the first year of life.
Monthly video recordings are made in structured situations in the University and in more natural settings at home.
For the many hearing parents who have to cope with their deaf babies, this project's results could be of great use.

The aim of the research is to find out how children come to comprehend the requirements of effective verbal communication and the causes of communication failure.
Research already carried out has shown that five and six year olds often do not know that to guarantee successful communication, the speaker must identify the intended meaning uniquely from the listener's point of view.
Furthermore, they tend not to maintain a clear distinction between the speaker's intended meaning on the one hand, and the message used to convey that meaning to a listener on the other.
This misconception about the requirements of effective verbal communication can have important consequences in that young children may not use their linguistic skills as effectively as they might either as speakers or as listeners.
In this research, the investigator plans to study the possibility that adults on occasion expect young children to behave as if they already have an accurate conception of the process of communication, and that as a result of being expected to behave in this more mature way they come to realise why that behaviour is appropriate.
The investigator also plans to follow up a finding that having perfected the distinction between meaning and message, children may come to view reality in a new way: incoming information can be construed as offering clues about reality, whereas before it was assumed to be reality.

This project is an investigation of how good people are at predicting the future in terms of numerical probabilities.
It is hoped to provide answers to the following questions: Are some people better at forecasting than others?
Does the relative desirability of a future event affect the assessment of a likelihood?
Does the difficulty of the prediction task and the way a prediction is made have an influence on how good predictions are?
Can we develop techniques for helping people to make better forecasts?
The research is expected to have major implications for application of Decision Analysis, a widely used management decision aid.
Decision analysis uses subjective forecasts as a prime input for specifying ‘best’ decisions.

This initiative originated in the work carried out in the earlier SSRC initiative, Young People in Society (YPS).
Launched in 1979, the YPS initiative embraced a number of studies of adolescent development in the areas of occupational and political socialisation, drinking and smoking, friendship and peer groups, and juvenile delinquency.
Papers produced by Rudolf Schaffer summarising the results of the YPS programme and by Harry McGurk discussing design possibilities for the longitudinal study were circulated to the research community and comments were invited on how the initiative should be developed.
It was decided that the main thrust of the research should be in the domain of economic and political socialisation during adolescence.
Economic and political socialisation can be usefully conceived as the process that shapes young people's understanding of, and attitudes towards, the economic and political system in which they live and which enables them to function in it.
The initiative will focus particularly on three areas of adolescent development within this domain:
(a)
processes underlying identity formation and social integration; processes underlying the formation of self concepts and facilitating or inhibiting assimilation with social roles/relationships/sub cultures/groups;
(b)
social representation and attribution, particularly with respect to the growth of economic and political understanding and acceptance of responsibility;
(c)
the emergence of agency and self efficacy and individual differences in the development of self-regulated behaviour and attitudes.
The contextualising of these different facets of development in terms of adolescent careers through education, the labour market, social and domestic life, their interaction with each other and the social and occupational structures of the geographical locality in which young people live will be another important feature of the initiative.
Throughout, the emphasis will be on inderdisciplinary enquiry, drawing upon and trying to integrate wherever possible psychological and sociological (theoretical and research) perspectives.
Besides helping to unravel the myriad interactions between adolescent development and social and occupational structures, the initiative will also be seeking answers to practical policy questions in the fields of education, training and employment.
Of particular interest is the influence of the family and the mass media on the decisions teenagers take at different stages in their careers and how education and training schemes particularly need to accommodate them.
Subsequently, psychologist Glynis Breakwell (University of Surrey) and sociologist Ken Roberts (University of Liverpool) were commissioned to write reviews of current research and theory on this subject and identified the main questions which the new initiative should attempt to answer.
The council also approved the appointment of Dr John Bynner of the School of Education, Open University as co-ordinator for the initiative, whose first task was to formulate a research design which was finalized at a workshop held in the summer of 1986.
Six groups were invited to submit proposals for the research and four were finally selected to carry it out in Swindon, Kirkaldy, Liverpool and Sheffield.
The research began in the autumn of 1986.

The research is designed to obtain detailed information on the behaviour and attitudes of drivers when overtaking.
Overtaking behaviour at a number of locations will be monitored over a period of several months using video-recording equipment.
The observational data will provide information on different styles of overtaking including their effectiveness and how often they happen.
Information about the circumstances in which different overtaking strategies are employed will also be collected and analysed.
The second stage of the research includes a large scale questionnaire survey of a sample of local drivers.
The survey will provide information about drivers' perceptions of overtaking as well as of being overtaken.
How people describe overtaking behaviour will also be recorded during the survey.
The reported overtaking behaviour and the data from the observations of actual overtaking behaviour will then be compared.
This research should provide valuable information on an important aspect of driver behaviour and contribute to the continuing development of measures designed to improve road safety.
The Joint ESRC/SERC Transport Committee (JTC) was established in 1978 for an initial period of two years and extended for a further 4 years after a review in 1980.
It reported to the Environment and Planning Committee of ESRC and the Environment Committee of the SERC Engineering Board.
A further review of JTC was conducted during 1984 and it was agreed by both Councils that the Committee should be dissolved with effect from January 1985.
Arrangements were made for regular ‘round table’ discussions between representatives of the relevant Committees in both Research Councils, for the regular exchange of information about research planned, commissioned or completed and for continued co-operation where appropriate.
The Environment and Planning Committee will continue to be responsible for the development of social science research in transport.

From time to time, it becomes necessary to reorganise information that has previously been learned and structured in a particular way.
For example, it may become necessary to reject information which was initially taken to be reliable and important enough to interpret and organise subsequent information dealing with the same topic.
In these circumstances, any instructions to delete that information from the memory record can present a number of problems; recalling precisely which information derives from the suspect source and tracing dependent inferences made at the time or later.
Other forms of editing demand can also occur such as inserting information which was previously unavailable, or, combining two areas of information initially thought of as being independent but which are shown later to be related.
The present project is concerned with establishing such editing demands during the course of learning with the aim of investigating the strategies people employ as they try to comply.
A variety of learning measures are used including reading times during acquisition; free recall and direct assessments of the learner's comprehension of the revised memory record.

Changes over time to things that are seen and heard are powerful forms of stimulation for young infants, and the main purpose of the research is to explore systematically infants' ability to detect and respond to such change.
The research is a development of work that recently received ESRC support.
Most of the research is concerned to explore in some detail the response to visually presented sequences of light flashes, where these sequences form patterns.
In most investigations one pattern is shown to the baby until it no longer attracts his/her attention.
At this point it is replaced by different patterns, some of which are different in the time sequence of the light flashes from the one that he/she has previously seen.
If the baby looks more at the new patterns, it indicates that he/she can discriminate them from the original.
In this way, infants' ability to detect rhythm, grouping, melodies, and other changes over time are explored.
For some of the work auditory sequences are presented to investigate the question of whether auditory and visual temporal patterns mean the same thing to the infant.
Additional research investigates the extent to which the visual cortex is functioning at birth, using newborn infants' ability to discriminate between stimuli that differ in orientation alone as the index of cortical functioning.

Following the announcement by CEGB in 1980 of five sites to be investigated as possible locations for a new nuclear power station in South West England, the investigator surveyed the attitudes and beliefs concerning energy issues, and nuclear power in particular, held by residents of the communities most closely affected by these proposals.
The original design included two control communities, one with experience of a local nuclear power station (Hinckley Point), and one with no such experience or prospect of a similar development.
However, this design had to be reinterpreted in the light of the CEGB's decision to build a further power station at Hinckley Point rather than at he five sites originally named.
A combination of interview and questionnaire studies and a content analysis of media coverage was employed, with the purpose of elucidating the reasons for people's preferences for different energy options, their perceptions of the risks involved, and of the viability of alternative energy sources.
Later studies have concentrated on comparisons with attitudes to oil development in Dorset and on reactions to Chernobyl.

What is technically feasible is sometimes unacceptable to consumers.
It is already technically feasible to build ‘robot’ bank and building society branches, but such an exercise would be a disaster if consumers refused to use them and switched their savings elsewhere.
The research will investigate the problems people have in using experimental machines in building societies.
The research seeks to improve the instructions for usage of new technology; to identify groups of consumers who have particular problems and how to help; and finally to examine wider economic and societal implications.

What is understood when a particular text is read and how such understanding is achieved are the main theoretical issues investigated in the present research.
The investigation asks specific questions on how the reader establishes who or what the text is about and what or how directives are issued by the text to enable this to happen.
It is assumed that the way in which a text is organised highlights specific communicative functions.
In imposing a particular text structure, the content of the message in the text may be presented from a particular perspective or point of view.
In narratives, such a view is often that presented by the main character in the story.
The investigation aims to study the effects of a variety of textual clues, incorporated in the text, on the understanding of the particular message in the text.
It is designed to determine which features of a text direct the reader toward a particular perspective, how much of the text is understood and, hence, attributed to that viewpoint and what effects if any, the perspective will have on other textual information not attributed to the main perspective.
The principal method of investigation is the presentation of carefully prepared texts, with the aid of a computer, which the reader encounters in a self-paced reading time setting.
At the end of each text sequence a Yes/No set of questions follows to which the reader indicates a response.
The computer records reading times and response latencies.
In addition, a continuation task will be used as a further method of assessing what is in the mind of the reader after reading a particular text.
It requires the reader to write the next sentence
(s)
of a story.
This technique shows the entities most likely to be mentioned by the reader and, hence, indicates which entities predominate for various reasons.
The convergence of the techniques will cast light on perspectives and how they are controlled.

The Girls and Mathematics Unit has carried out a substantial number of project on girls' classroom performance in Mathematics, spanning nursery to secondary schools.
The findings from these projects indicate some of the ways in which girls' performance is produced and evaluated.
Up till this point there has been no opportunity to coordinate the data from different age groups.
This project will finalise that collation and produce a summary document for use by policy makers and practitioners.

The main aim of this study is to investigate the way young people coming on to labour market in Northern ireland for the first time cope with stress of unemployment and in particular to investigate factors that might moderate any negative impact unemployment may have, such as participation in the Youth training programme.
To do this the study will analyse data from a project undertaken by the Policy Planning Research Unit of the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland which has followed a random sample of some 3,000 young people eligible to leave school in Northern ireland in 1984 and who have been re- interviewed annually until 1987.
The data available include, among others, measures of self-esteem, a measure of attitudes towards work, a measure of psychological well- being and information about educational achievements, employment status, and family background.

The research is intended as a pilot contribution towards a social psychological account of the emergence of gender divisions in leisure behaviour.
The central focus is the development of leisure interests during adolescence and the theoretical framework draws upon recent work in social cognition.
It is assumed that the purposeful provision of facilities, or the success of intervention strategies to encourage fuller use of available resources, depends critically upon an account of adolescents' reasoning about leisure.
To provide such an account, a range of techniques will be exploited in order to investigate adolescent conceptions of leisure and the ways in which these reflect the constraints due to broader social factors including gender and home locality.

The aim of the research is to develop a scientific theory of the processes involved in face and person recognition that can account for normal performance, and will help in understanding the different types of difficulty in recognising faces experienced by patients who have had strokes.
The work to be carried out falls into four sections:
(i)
Collection of a library of photographs of known and unfamiliar faces that can then be selected on the basis of being of a similar degree of familiarity, of similar appearance, or of similar occupation.
These photographs will then be used to carry out the studies involved in the research;
(ii)
Experiments intended to test and develop understanding of face and person recognition;
(iii)
A study of everyday failures and difficulties in person recognition.
This will attempt to classify and explain the different types of mistake that occur.
This is useful in understanding the problems experienced by some stroke patients, and may also be useful in understanding when eye witnesses' reports can and cannot be relied upon;
(iv)
Studies of stroke patients.
These studies are intended to describe precisely the types of difficulty in recognising faces experienced by some stroke patients.
They will also clarify whether such difficulties are best seen as an exaggerated form of more normal occurrences, or as arising in a different way from the mistakes made by normal people.

An improved understanding of the sources of everyday likes and dislikes would be of lasting theoretical importance in psychology, and might also have practical applications in education, product design and marketing, broadcasting, and leisure industries.
Although experimental aesthetics has been an active field of research in psychology for more than a century, many interesting questions remain unanswered.
The aims of the project are to investigate the development of attitudes towards everyday objects, names, and tunes, and to discover why liking for such things sometimes increases and sometimes declines when they become more familiar.
A new theory linking familiarity, complexity, and liking for two special classes of objects will be tested rigorously for the first time.
The research method will be modelled on previous work of members of the Aesthetics Research Group published during the period 1973-82.
Laboratory experiments will be used to gauge the reactions of people of various ages and population groups to a variety of visual, verbal, and musical items.

The difficulties which children between the ages of roughly 3 and 7 have in understanding basic logical and scientific principles may be related to their inability appropriately to interpret certain linguistic terms.
For example, when an adult asks them to decide whether two amounts are ‘the same’, they may interpret this as meaning ‘look the same’.
In general, young children may not distinguish between judgements about reality and judgements about appearance or subjective opinion.
This project is concerned with how and when the distinction develops between verbal reference to objective facts and verbal reference to mental states.
The experiments will principally involve questioning children about stories whose interpretation depends upon understanding the different logical implications which ‘mental state verbs’(eg think, believe, know) have in contrast to other kinds of verb (eg walk towards, stand next to).
One of the hypotheses which will be tested is that comprehension of the logical character of ‘mental state verbs’ is necessary for understanding that some sentences are true in virtue of their form alone (eg ‘The father is a man’).
There will also be studies of how children's tendency to believe or disbelieve statements made to them by other children is influenced by the presence of such verbs in the statements.

Changes in level of depression associated with different employment histories over a five-year period will be studied.
Duration and type of employment will be important considerations when assessing the ‘protective’ effect of employment.
Attitudinal scales, completed by the mother, will indicate her orientation towards child rearing, women's role in society, maternal employment and general world view on an authoritarian/democratic dimension.
These scales will be used to indicate mothers whose views about personal rights and maternal role conflict with their employment status.
Such conflicts may increase the risk of depression but be resolved by a subsequent change in employment status.
Differences in children's health, behaviour and attainment at 10 years associated with different maternal employment histories will be examined after taking account of children's initial behaviour and cognitive ability at 5 years, maternal depression and attitudes and other relevant socio-economic factors.

Co-operation between General Accident Insurance company and the ESRC has produced a new initiative on road safety.
General Accident is putting up 500,000 for research on the psychology of the road user.
The research will be managed by the ESRC and will support work at universities in Aston, Edinburgh, Manchester, Reading and MRC unit in Cambridge.
A range of issues will be investigated including sex differences in driver performance at Aston University and training children in safe road crossing behaviour at Edinburgh.
Two research projects will take place at Manchester, one of the hazards faced by elderly drivers and pedestrians and the other on attitudes of teenagers.
At Cambridge research will take place on how individuals make judgements of risk and at reading on how drivers perceive their own ability and accident likelihood.
The research will be co-ordinated by Dr Frank McKenna at Reading University.

Several studies have characterised the young social drug user as an adolescent who is alienated from school and who is more involved with peer group activities than activities centred around the home.
Young drug users typically experience conflict with their parents, who may encourage them to spend much of their time away from the family setting or conform to strict boundaries whilst the family home.
In residential environments where boundary enforcement is strong, adolescents may be tempted into boundary-transgressing behaviour which may well generalise later on to drug/alcohol seeking behaviour.
The research is designed to contribute to the understanding of problem drinking among teenagers.
This pilot study examines the role of boundaries in the regulation of behaviour within the family setting, involving the interplay of family activities and domestic space.
It also examines the influence on family behaviour of the physical layout of houses and flats.
Data collection is mainly by questionnaire and structured interviews with families, youth groups and problem drinkers.
The results will have implications for intervention strategies, domestic design and family interaction.

This research examines the face-to-face communications between teachers and children in primary classrooms, in order to understand better the ways in which teachers and children develop a shared understanding of the work they are doing in class.
The project is concerned therefore with such things as the ways teachers explain new topics and concepts to children, the ways they check on children's understanding, the kinds of questions that teachers and children ask, the assumptions that are made about what is already known, and the kinds of misunderstandings that arise and how these are dealt with
The data come from video-recordings of lessons in progress, supplemented by interviews with both the teachers and children involved.
Although this research is expected, and intended, to have practical educational relevance, it is hoped to provide more than a descriptive analysis of classroom practice.
The aim is to provide a theoretical account of how people develop shared understanding, as exemplified in the process of teaching and learning.
Some earlier, related research by the same team is reported in Language in School & Community (ed N Mercer; Edward Arnold 1981).
The outcome of the present project will be reported in a book entitled Common Knowledge, to be published by Methuen in 1987.

The project investigates the development, during the school years, of communication skills which depend upon the interaction between participants during conversation.
The research uses two experimental techniques for producing natural dialogue.
The first is a computer controlled co-operative maze name.
Where successes depends upon each players ability to describe positions in the maze to the other player.
The second is a paper and pencil name which requires players to communicate complex instructions about the to follow through the maze.
Children from primaries 4 and 6 and secondary 2 will be tested on both games in the first year of the project and then retested a year later to yield a substantial collection of dialogue transports.
The investigation of international skills will depend upon analysing of the transcripts and computer simulation of certain features of the dialogues.
The analysis will be concerned with co-operative access of the dialogues — now pairs of speakers work together to establish effective description schemes, how they learn to give and follow instructions and now they learn to use appropriate feedback following an ambiguous description or instructions.
This research should be of interest to psychologists and educationalists as well as those involved in designing effective dialogue type whose interfaces to expert systems.

This project will test a theory of how people recognize objects and pictures, which has been developed from previous work by the author and supported by the ESRC The theory helps us to understand; 1.
the mental processes involved in object recognition; 2 how object recognition and naming develops in children; and 3. how it can break down in certain cases of brain damage.
The research focuses on the idea that the time taken by people to identify objects can help to indicate the mental processes involved in object identification.
The ease of object identification seems to vary according to the category that the object belongs to.
For, instance, inanimate objects are typically easier to identify than animate objects.
The project examines the properties of the objects which affect their identification time, in order to provide a detailed account of which properties influence identification, and of how their influence is brought to bear.
By understanding how various properties of objects influence their identification, we gain the background knowledge necessary for building more efficient artificial recognition systems, for understanding the development of recognition in children, and its impairment after brain damage.

The main aim of this project is to examine the relationship between parents' facial expressiveness (ie how facially expressive they are when feeling emotional) and their children's skill in decoding non verbal information (in this case, their ability to recognise emotions from others' facial expressions).
Previous research has shown that a child's skill in recognising facial expressions of emotion is strongly and positively associated with his or her social popularity: socially isolated children tend to be less able than their more popular counterparts to recognise facial expressions of emotion.
Social isolation, in turn, is known to be associated with various measures of social and psychological problems in later life.
It is therefore important to understand the causes of individual differences in children's abilities to interpret non verbal information correctly.
The present research is based on the premise that family style of emotional expression is a key factor in this respect.
Forty 4-person (2 parents, 2 children) families will be studied.
The measures being taken will include measures of facial expressiveness and of ability to interpret non verbal information, and the investigators expect to find that children of facially expressive parents will show greater ability to interpret non verbal information correctly.

The Welsh language has rapidly declined this century.
At the turn of the century, some half of the population in Wales spoke Welsh.
The Census of 1981 revealed that this figure had dropped to one in five residents in Wales.
Attitude to the Welsh language is an important barometer of likely future language trends in Wales.
In particular, previous research has indicated that attitudes to Welsh tend to decline during the early and middle teens.
The research aims to investigate the reasons for change in attitude to the Welsh language amongst 13 to 16 year olds.An attitude survey of first, second and third year Secondary pupils in 1988 will be repeated with the same pupils in 1990.
Change in the attitude to Welsh of some 800 pupils will be examined in terms of youth culture, use of mass media, identification models, language background of the home as well as the school and neighbourhood, type of school attended, self concept, achievement level, gender and age.
in addition the research will examine attitude to bilingualism as a concept importantly different from attitude to Welsh.

An anaphor is a word, phrase or ellipsis that has the same meaning as a previous word or phrase in a text, for example a third person pronoun or a verbal ellipsis (eg Sarah likes burgundy, and Sally, claret).
Anaphors are common in both spoken and written language and a theory of text comprehension must explain how they are understood.
The most promising such theory is the theory of ‘mental models’, whose crucial insight is that readers extract from a text a ‘model’ of the situation in the ‘real or imaginary) world that the text is about.
Developing the theory is complicated by the fact that the linguistic structure of the text does not necessarily mirror the structure of the world.
It follows that an anaphor might be understood using information about the previous text or information about the situation the text describes.
Indeed, different anaphors are probably understood using different information.
The goal of this project is to develop a detailed account of how anaphors are interpreted.
The principal method of investigation will be laboratory experiments, but the way anaphors are used in published texts will also be studied.

In recent years there has been a significant growth in interest in the study of children's training about economic issues.
Surprisingly children's knowledge and beliefs about unemployment and related issues have been almost totally neglected.
Studies of adolescents have reported highly negative perceptions of the unemployment (ag.Gurney, 1981) and Breagwell (1933) suggested that it is not un reasonable to assume that the attribution of attitudes to others, which attack one's self esteem, may be casually linked to the insecurity and anxiety commonly felt by the unemployed.
The origins and development course of such attitudes are, however, virtually unchartered.
The proposed series of investigations will examine children's understanding of economic need, income distribution and unemployment.
The investigations will comprise an inter-related set of sorting, sneering and judgemental tasks.
Subjects will also be interviewed about the reasons for unemployment and about the kind of people who experienced unemployment.
The studies will be carried out with samples of children aged 6, 8, 10 and 12 years.
The samples will be drawn from both state and private schools and will include children whose families have personal experience of unemployment as well as those who have no such experiences.
The major product of the proposed investigation will be a detailed description of the content and form of the belief system which children of different ages and different social background have constructed about work, unemployment and pay.
The data will also contribute to the elaboration of future theoretical studies and help to inform the development of a school curriculum in these area.

People can recognise familiar faces despite changes in head angle, lighting, expression and hairstyle.
The brain must extract, from a novel view of a face, the information necessary to achieve a match with a representation stored in memory.
What is the nature of the information extracted from a face, and what is the nature of the stored representations in memory with which incoming information is compared?
Experiments are planned which will help to answer these questions, thereby increasing theoretical understanding of face recognition, and failures to recognise faces (which are important in social and legal contexts).
Some experiments will involve asking people to match faces which have been transformed in various ways (eg head angle, expression).
Speed as well as accuracy of decision will be recorded, and the results will reveal whether recognition is based on particular views of the face.
Other experiments will involve presenting faces on video, and comparing recognition of these moving faces with recognition using still photographs.
This will reveal whether movement itself conveys information useful for face recognition.

The research consists of experimental studies designed to clarify our understanding of how familiar faces are identified and remembered.
A functional model of face recognition will be developed and tested.
The planned studies fall into three groups.
The first experiments assess how subjects’ recognition of photographs of familiar faces is affected if these are disguised or otherwise altered in various ways, and clarify which features of faces are important for their recognition.
The second group of experiments examine how face recognition is affected by the context in which a face is presented, and allow a comparison with contextual effects observed in studies of word recognition, a comparison which is of some theoretical interest.
The final experiments involve remembering when or where familiar people were last encountered and asks how new information about those people is integrated with pre-existing knowledge of them.
In all experiments, subjects' speed as well as accuracy of decision will be recorded to allow a detailed analysis of the perceptual and memory processes involved.

The first part of the project is concerned with Autobiographical Memory in old age.
There has been very little previous research on autobiographical memory.
What do elderly people remember from their past lives?
Do they remember the remote past better than the recent past?
Is memorability determined by the age of the memory or the nature of the remembered event?
In this project people aged between 20 and 80 will be asked to complete a questionnaire which is designed to reveal what parts of the life span autobiographical memories are most readily drawn from; what characterizes the life events that are particularly memorable; and whether memories from different parts of the life span differ in content and quality.
The second part of the project extends previous studies by Cohen and Faulkner of what is known as Reality Monitoring.
This is the ability to distinguish between memories of events that actually occurred and memories of events that were only imagined, planned or thought about.
Experiments showed that people over seventy tend to confuse these two kinds of memory and their errors take the form of mistakenly asserting that imagined or planned events really happened.
Further experiments will be carried out to determine the underlying reasons for this kind of confusion and how far it occurs in everyday life situations.

The project is a contribution to a relatively neglected issue, namely how emotions such as guilt, shame and embarrassment are acquired.
The sample will consist of 5 to 12 year olds and their parents.
The latter will be examined with respect to their beliefs about development and emotionality of their children and the social practices they engage in, with a view to examining how such social practices contribute to the acquisition of the emotions in questions.
The project has a number of scientific, social and applied implications.
It will constitute a contribution to the relatively neglected area of emotional development from childhood to early adolescence and help to elucidate the role these emotions play in the development of self monitored social control.
Furthermore, the results will be relevant to educational psychology, socialization process, child rearing and moral development.

The gesture of pointing with the index fingure is a specifically human way of communicating.
When pointing first by the baby to draw the attention of another person to an interesting object.
Our general hypothesis, in studying the origins of pointing in babies, is that the ‘referential’ function of pointing may precede naming, in the acquisition of speech.
We expect that pointing will be accompanied by other pre-linguistic behaviours that indicate communication and sharing of attention with others.
For example infants should check that person being communicated with is also looking at the interesting object.
The constellation of behaviours: pointing, vocalising and checking may be closely tied to the acquistion of language.
Attractive moving objects, a radio controlled car and remoyely controlled dolls will be used to elicit pointing from babies in the presence of their mothers.
Their pointing gestures and vocalisations will be video-recorded to allow detailed analyses to be carried out on the characteristics of pre-verbal communication.
We will establish when and how often the baby checks to see if mother is attending to the pointing gesture.
These behaviours will be contrasted with what the baby does in the presence of stationery objects which are just out of reach.
This will enable us to ascertain whether pointing is an intrinsically social, communicative act or whether it may develop out of other non-social behaviour, such as reading.
The various factors which elicit pointing, such as distance and spatial location in relation to the infant, whether the object is moving or not, will provide important information about the nature of the processes involved which support shared attention.
The acoustic features of the infant's vocalisation will be analysed using speech spectrographic techniques to establish whether there are any typical melodic patterns associated with pointing.
Consistent patterns would suggest that even the earliest vocalisations may carry some meaning (eg Look at that! what's that?) even though the infant has not yet acquired a convential vocabulary.
Indeed, our hypothesis is that a basic level of shared meaning may be the important foundation for the comprehension of adult speech and it's eventual mastery by the child.

The project will examine the long term retention of knowledge that was originally acquired from formal education and which has since lain dormant.
How long does disused knowledge persist in memory?
Do we forget all kinds of knowledge at the same rate or is some knowledge more enduring?
Is knowledge lost from memory or does it change, becoming vague and imprecise, or distorted, or disconnected and fragmented?
To address these questions retention of several different kinds of knowledge including computer programming, a science, a work of literature and a language will be measured after varying retention periods extending up to more than 30 years.
As well as assesing how much is retained, tests will be designed to assess what kind knowledge drops out what kind is retained, and how knowledge structures change over time.
The study will also take into account the effects of aging, which may contribute to a decline in knowledge retention over a long period.
We shall also assess the contribution of the standard of the original learning and the degree of interest in the knowledge domain as factors in retention.

The research is concerned with children's understanding of their own emotions and their growing ability to control and re-interpret their emotional reactions.
An initial study showed that children's understanding of emotion changes considerably between 6 and 11 years.
Older children understand that a particular situation does not inevitably provoke a particular emotion: the emotion you display depends on how you view the situation, whether you try to change your emotional reaction to it, and whether you try to conceal it from other people.
Younger children, in contrast, appear more confident that a particular situation will provoke a particular emotion; they have fewer doubts about the diagnosis of other people's emotions and less insight into the voluntary control of emotion.
The initial research is pursued in two directions.
First, how firmly do young children believe that the current situation dictates the way you feel?
This is an important question because such a belief conflicts with the plausible assumption that intense emotion often endures beyond the situation that provoked it, and colours one's reactions to later events.
Second, the study looks at the emotional reactions that young children actually display.
Are their emotions in fact dictated by the current situation, or do they display emotional reactions which are more persistent and more complex than they can articulate in words?

A recently completed study with young children, supported by the ESRC, demonstrated a powerful method for helping children to learn to read and to spell by combining training in analysis of the sounds in words with training in constructing words with coloured plastic letters.
The aim of the present project is to explain the underlying reasons for that method's success.
The hypothesis to be tested is that the method works by making explicit the connections between the strategy of reading by remembering what a word looks like and the strategy of reading by analysing the sounds in words.
The test involves experiments in which some children are trained to connect the two strategies while others are trained in the two strategies but with no explicit connection between them.
The hypothesis about the importance of making connections between different strategies will be extended to the learning of mathematics, and also to the teaching of children whose intelligence is normal but who have specific difficulties with reading and with mathematics, the hypothesis being that these children fail because they do not make a strong enough connection between different strategies.

Spatial skills are involved in a number of school subjects, such as mathematics, geography and design as well as a number of professions, such as engineering, architecture and computing.
Different theories about the organisation of the brain in left-handers predict either superiority or inferiority on spatial tasks, whilst studies of certain occupational groups indicate elevated rates of left handedness.
This research aims to resolve the debate about spatial abilities and left handedness.
It will distinguish between different types of spatial tasks with different cognitive demands, for example, those which require the mental rotation of objects in three dimensions and those which require the manual assembly of spatial designs.
The view that women are on average better on language tasks and men on spatial tasks continues to receive serious attention.
This research will also investigate the interaction of sex and handedness.
Further, the influence of a family history of left handedness on both right and left handers will be assessed.
Four age groups will be investigated: young children aged 4-6; pre pubertal school children aged 9-11; young adults aged 18-28: and elderly skills may shed light upon scholastic abilities and disabilities and occupational choice.

The ability to read Braille is still the most important basis of educating blind children.
But Braille is difficult and reading is often retarded and slow compared to reading visual print.
Nevertheless, there are some fast Braille readers.
The problem is that we do not as yet know how fluent Braille takes place, or what strategies fast readers use.
It is the object of the present study to find this out and to apply the findings in teaching beginning and slow readers.
What we need to know most of all is how recognising the raised dot patterns of Braille by touch relates to understanding the meaning of sentences and the ‘gist’ of a passage of text.
Several hypotheses about this relationship will be tested.
The tests are made possible by an apparatus which has been specially designed to film the finger movements of readers from below transparent surfaces.
Finger positions and speeds at every location in a text are recorded together with the reader's voice during normal reading.
Texts are varied systematically and types of finger movement and speeds on target words can be compared for the different demands made on the reader.
The findings should produce a model of fluent Braille which can be used to improve the strategies of beginning and slow Braille readers.

The aim of this project is to improve the understanding of social behaviour and its development in preschool children, with particular reference to those social skills that are required for group interaction.
Most of what is known about social development is based on the study of encounters between a child and one other person, yet much of a child's life takes place in groups of more than two persons — within the family, the neighbourhood peer groups, the pre-school group, and so on.
The study investigates by means of a mixture of systematic observation and simple experiments, those skills that are required to meet the additional demands of multiple-person situations, the intention being to identify and describe such skills and trace their development over age.

This project has three objectives: to investigate how accurately parents and their adolescent children can predict each other 's thinking over complex moral and social problems; to assess whether the degree of such accuracy is related to the nature and extent of parent-adolescent conflicts, and to test whether an individual at one level of cognitive development can describe the view of another person who is assumed to be at a higher level.
The research involves 320 parent-adolescent pairs.
The adolescents range from 12-18 years of age.
Birth order, sex of parent and sex of child are also controlled for.
Each subject is asked to make judgements about a series of moral dilemmas from three perspectives:
(a)
the subject's own perspective;
(b)
what he/she regards as the perspective of the other family member and
(c)
his/her assessment of the other family member's perspective of the subject himself/herself.
The study provides data on the social cognition of parent-adolescent interaction and contributes to our understanding of the development of moral judgements.

In private households most purchased energy is used for space heating.
Differences between similar households and dwellings in total consumption range up to 3:1.
Predicting fuel consumption and the effects of energy conservation practices has had only limited success.
This is particularly true for attitudinal research.
A fresh approach to these problems rests on the hypothesis that fuel primarily serves to maintain an indoor climate providing thermal comfort (to a considerable degree of accuracy it is possible to specify optimal conditions by application of the psycho-physiological theory of thermal comfort).
Research attention has also perhaps been focused to an undue degree on the adoption of physical conservation measures (eg roof insulation) and on the costs of a broad set of household behaviours (eg opening windows while heating).
The prime aim of the present research is to integrate social psychological approaches which seek to predict energy behaviour from attitudes with thermal comfort theory.
It explores the degree to which comfort requirements determine behaviour and finally fuel consumption.
The role and importance of attitudes to energy conservation are investigated in relation to comfort requirements.
A second aim is concerned with the ways in which the physical characteristics of houses and heating systems interact with their occupants' characteristics to produce different patterns of energy consumption.
For example, do households living in well-insulated accommodation balance out potential savings by maintaining higher temperatures?
The research makes use of data which were collected for the SE Gas Region in order to identify indicators of change in gas consumption.
That provided a large data set based on face-to-face interviews, self-completion questionnaires and physical surveys.
A sample of 150 households has been monitored over two heating seasons and is accompanied by a larger sample in order to check for the representativeness of the more detailed data collected in the panel study.

In the investigators' recent research into subjective response to road traffic noise, it has been shown that when there is an abrupt increase or decrease in noise exposure, the change in people's dissatisfaction with noise is greater than would be predicted from the change in noise level.
In other words, subjective response to the same noise level will be different at two sites if noise levels have recently undergone a change at one site.
It is important, both from the point of view of understanding the psychological factors underlying response to noise, and from the point of view of practical policy decisions, to assess the persistence of this effect of change in noise level.
Previous research leads to the prediction that the effect should be permanent.
The present study is intended to be a follow-up survey of sites which have been investigated by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory.
Changes in traffic noise at these sites affected subjective response in a manner consistent with the investigators' findings, and the investigators therefore predict that, to the extent that noise levels have remained constant at these sites, subjective response will also have remained constant.

When an object is recognised and comprehended, a large amount of associated knowledge is activated.
For example, on seeing a cat, one knows that it is a living thing, a mammal and a common pet.
One also knows about its possible colours, texture of fur, the noises it makes, and could give an estimate of its size and weight.
The research aims to find out the contribution of the different types of activated information for the successful production of the object's name.
In particular, the role of non verbally acquired object properties such as colour, sound and texture will be investigated.
Computer controlled displays will allow visual aspects of the picture to be systematically altered and considered.
There are two obvious practical applications of the research.
Firstly, the provision of better therapeutic techniques for the rehabilitation of naming after brain damage.
Secondly, the provision of better educational material for teaching naming to young children.

In addition to being crucial for successful orientation and movement in the world, spatial abilities are central to many classroom tasks, for instance, interpretation of graphs and map-reading. despite this importance, developmental spatial cognition is under-researched compared with other topics such as development of reading, writing and mathematical skills.
This research project investigates the development of spatial cognition in early childhood, focusing on three areas; 1) spatial orientation in 2-5 year olds, 2) use of coordinate reference systems by 4-7 year olds, and 3) interpretation and use of maps by 4-7 year olds.
Recent research in other areas of cognitive development indicates that putting tasks in a familiar setting improves young children's performance.
The general approach adopted in the current research is to discover the task settings that maximize young children's spatial performance, and to investigate the degree to which performance transfers from these to other settings.
The investigation will proceed through a series of cross-sectional experimental studies, in which children's performance on given tasks will be compared between familiar and unfamiliar or abstract settings.
In each case, the investigation will be looking for evidence for transfer of ability between one task setting and another, and evidence for the degree of transfer changing with increasing age.

In previous work, the investigator has developed a means to investigate children's understanding of recursive beliefs in story characters, that is, whether they can understand that John does not know that Mary knows where the ice cream van is.
This project investigates whether this ability is related to children's understanding of social situations which may involve similar knowledge relationships between people.
For instance the project will assess children's understanding of the following situation: at a pedestrian crossing I can rely on the motorist stopping if I know that he has seen me, but I cannot rely on it if I know that he has not seen me.
Or the project will test their understanding of why it is particularly bad to break a promise.
One main reason is that I know that the other person thinks I will act as promised and therefore she will do something which she would not do otherwise.
Also, young children's answers to examination questions may be off the mark, not because they do not know what they are being tested for, but because they misinterpret the examiner's intention.
They may think the experimenter wants to know himself and not realise that he just wants to know whether the child knows the answer.

An earlier investigation showed that 18 to 42 month old children playing together in pairs chose gender-appropriate toys in their action based play with toys, but that only girls of 37 to 42 months used girls' toys more in their pretend play.
In addition, the gender of the partner affected toy choice; there was more cross-gender toy choice in the action play of mixed pairs, but the oldest girls used boys' toys less in their pretend play when in the company of a boy.
The different patterns of boys' and girls' play were accounted for by suggesting that girls had acquired a more differentiated understanding of gender rules governing behaviour.
The superior recognition of gender-marked nouns and pronouns were marshalled as further evidence of their precocious development.
The unexpected finding of differences in the pretend play of boys and girls called for further research to test the robustness of the effect, and the apparent precocity of the girls prompted an extension to children up to 48 months of age.

The use of donor insemination to solve the problem of childlessness due to male infertility is becoming more common.
As a result of the secrecy which has traditionally surrounded donor insemination there is an almost complete lack of knowledge of how donor assisted families fare as the children grow up.
This ignorance has been noted and regretted in official reports over the past 40 years, most recently in the Warnock report.
The principal aim of the research is to collect information about how the use of donor insemination to solve childlessness affects the members of the family so created as the child grows up.
A group of infertile couples who were initially interviewed in 1981 (in a study funded by the SSRS) and who have one or more children now aged between 7 and 11 years who were conceived by donor insemination, will be interviewed again during the summer of 1989.
It is hoped that by examining the experience of family life of these couples a greater understanding may be achieved of how donor parentage affects the marital relationship, parent/child relationship, and relationships within the wider family.
Practices of keeping donor insemination secret from all others, and of keeping the child in ignorance of his/her means of conception which have traditionally been implicit in the provision of donor insemination are now in a state of flux.
It is hoped to gain some knowledge of how families view the role of secrecy as the child grows up.
Such knowledge will be necessary if families in future are to be helped to come to the more open acceptance of donor insemination which is envisaged in proposed legislation.

(Aims and methods) In early childhood, children grow and learn within their families and the importance of the family as a context for child development has received much attention.
To date, however, there has been rather little evidence on the means of transmission of difficulties.
THe aim of the study was to use three existing datasets to examine in detail the interaction of mothers and young children, and the means by which family difficulties are transmitted.
The three datasets each included a case group of children at risk, and an appropriate comparison group.
The risk factors were the parenting provided by mothers who were themselves in care as children (23 case, 21 comparison), mother who were depressed when their children were 2 years old (48 case, 27 comparison) and mothers whose children failed to grow in spite of the absence of any organic disorder (23 case and 23 comparison).
All three datasets had been relatively little analysed and the study aimed not only to identify general patterns of poor parenting but also to examine processes that might be specific to each risk factor.
The three datasets shared a common basic method for recording the interaction data dna a number of additional measures.
However, they differed in a number of background factors and in terms of sample design (e.g. one was pairwise matched).
The study thus had to tackle several methodological issues as well.

A great deal of human communication depends on the use of language.
It is the major medium for high-level training and it is widely used in most other forms of interaction.
Successful communication is based upon people's capacity to interpret prose and in all but the simplest cases this depends on the ability to work out the grammatical relationships between the words within sentences.
There are several theoretical proposals concerning how this is accomplished.
However, at present none of these accounts is fully satisfactory.
The present research aims to investigate parsing processes in fluent readers.
The experiments will focus on the mechanisms by which word and constituent order, context information and lexical information (including number, gender and case) are used to constrain the grammatical interpretation of sentences.
The main experimental procedure will involve measuring how long it takes people to read successive segments of carefully-prepared sentences presented on a microcomputer screen.
While the research is primarily concerned with comprehension in fluent readers it is likely to have implications for certain forms of reading backwardness and for the development of Natural Language Understanding programs for computers.

This research will investigate the development of children's competencies as television viewers between the ages of seven and twelve.
The research will be primarily qualitative, and will concentrate particularly on the ways in which interpretations of the medium are established and negotiated in small group talk.
It will also focus on the role of social class, gender and ethnic background in determining children's understanding and use of the medium.
Particular aspects of study will include the development of children's conceptions of television genres and narrative forms, their judgements about its representations of the social world and its degrees of realism, and their understanding of the processes of television production.
The project aims to provide and analysis of children's understanding of television which will enable broadcasters and educationalists to respond constructively to public concern about the ‘effects’ of the medium.
In particular, it is hoped that the research will inform the development of media education within the National Curriculum.

The research is intended to explore in detail different type of impairment affecting visual recognition after brain injury, and their implications for understanding the organisation of the visual recognition system.
Particular emphasis will be given to the implications of the finding that some patients with visual recognition impairments resulting from brain injury can show evidence, in implicit tasks, of ‘covert’ recognition of stimuli they fail to recognise explicitly.
(Explicit tests are considered to be those in which the ability under investigation is directly requested, whereas in implicit tests the capacity of interest is only involved as an apparently incidental aspect to the procedure.)
For example, patients who fail overtly to recognise familiar faces have been found to have skin conductance responses to ‘unrecognised’ familiar faces.
The aims of the research are to explore overt and covert face recognition abilities across a range of different types of visual recognition abilities across a range of different types of visual recognition impairment, in order to develop a more adequate understanding of this phenomenon of ‘covert’ recognition, and to begin to explore the possibility of suing covert knowledge as a basis for remediation of these very disabling conditions in suitable cases.

Despite the universal practice of informed consent for surgical therapy, several reports on the appreciation and recall by patients of their treatment have documented a poor understanding and recall of the basic facts relating to the nature of their operation.
The present study is designed to asses the extent of this problem and the factors which influence it.
In particular this investigation will assess the influence of the following on patients' comprehension and recall;
(i)
Patient attributes (age, mental, emotional and psychological state, personality type).
(ii)
Communication skills of the doctors in charge of these patients and the efficacy of written versus verbal information on the nature of the intended operation.
(iii)
The effect of drugs given before during or after the operation.
(iv)
The influence of serious complications following the operation.
The study will be undertaken in a consecutive cohort of 500 patients undergoing elective abdominal, thoracic and vascular surgery and involves audiotaping of information given to patients, issue of operation information cards (on a random basis) and assessment of the personality and mood traits.
Late recall will be tested by postal questionnaires at 6 months.

It is important for people who go blind as adults to retain their literacy.
The problem is that the change-over from visual print to reading and writing by touch seems to be extremely difficult.
The reasons for the difficulty are not well understood.
The problem is increasing as more people live longer and is thus quite urgent for practical reasons.
The change also raises important theoretical questions because reading by touch involves the same cognitive and linguistic skills as visual reading but uses a system which differs physically and in modality.
The theoretical and practical aims of the proposed study go hand in hand.
The study will test several hypotheses about the relation between perceptual and cognitive skills.
Braille is a particularly useful tool for probing predictions from different models because it depends on fine discrimination of raised dot patterns, and a rule system of contractions.
Other tactual systems will be compared with it.
The findings will test the generality of current models of visual reading, and will thus suggest whether and how previous reading skills, for instance the use of context and knowledge of spelling, can help people who have become blind to convert to reading by touch.

An important area of research within developmental social psychology concerns the processes and outcomes of youth socialisation.
Socialisation is viewed as the adaptation of young people to societal norms and values, and is revealed in the development of goals, attitudes and behaviours.
Studies of youth socialisation to date have almost exclusively focussed on young people educated in private(i.e fee-paying) schools.
A recent small-scale study undertaken at the University of Sheffield suggests that young people in private schools reveal distinctive processes of occupational, political and socio-economic socialisation.
This new project develops these ideas further by undertaking secondary analysis of the YOUTHSCAN data.
YOUTHSCAN sampled 15,000 babies born in one week in April 1970 and data was collected at birth, age 5, 10 and 16 years.
Over 1,000 of the YOUTHSCAN sample attended private schools.
The study will investigate the development of the privately educated in the sample, compared with a sample of 14,000 state and educated young people.

Over the past decade a sudden surge of research reports managed to answer the question of when people achieve a basic grasp of psychology: sometime in the fifth year of life we lay down the framework for generalisable inferences about the intentions of others.
Competence becomes manifest at that age; and it is essential to search for its precursors to test whether current techniques are too blunt to detect ‘latent competence’, current models too imprecise to point research optimally in that direction, and current theory too stark in the distinctions it draws to serve the interests of process models.
The project focuses on developing child-centered techniques suited to 3 year olds, not simply with the aim of pushing down the age of acquisition but in order to test whether a radical change occurs in the types of variable which elicit competent inferences.
The pilot work had indicated the need to cater for a lack of development of narrative skills and a reliance on contextual cues which standard experiments only sparsely provide.
The former leads to tests which are congenial to 3 year olds, the latter to the identification of variables whence functional changes in the child's ‘theory of mind’ can be modelled.

The aim of this research is to investigate the extent to which different reading patterns are related to different patterns of strength and weakness in performance in tasks which do not involve reading per se, but tap aspects of cognition which are relevant to the acquisition of reading.
To this end a group of sixty-nine 7-9 year old children were randomly sampled from the normal school population and given a battery of tests examining their reading ability, visual processing, phonological processing and short-term memory.
Considerable variation was found within this population and comparisons are currently being made between those children who might be regarded as readers of poor, average and high ability to establish whether different patterns of cognitive abilities may be used to account for this variation.
Data is also to be obtained using a similar battery of tests from a sample of dyslexic children with specific and unexpected reading retardation.
This will make it possible to assess whether there are systematic differences in their cognitive skills in comparison to reading age and chronological age controls or whether they show a similar pattern to poor readers found in the normal school population.

The attitudes towards parenthood and parenting of people living and working in a multi-ethnic community are explored.
The ideas about and experiences of pregnancy, childbirth, children and childcare of women of Asian origin and descent are compared with those of other women living in East London.
The impact of factors such as family size, religion, how long women have lived in the UK, and how westernized they consider themselves to be are examined.
Women's ideas are supplemented by health workers' accounts of providing health care in a multi-ethnic context.
Additionally young people's ideas about parenthood and family life are related to their decisions about education, careers, and heterosexual relations to evaluate theoretical approaches to adolescent development and especially to question whether the establishment of an identity separate from parents and family is necessarily a key issue for young people.
A variety of research techniques, including questionnaires and interviews, are employed.
Analysis focuses on general themes emerging from the accounts of mothers, young people and health workers and also on differences according to age, ethnicity, gender and familiarity with the UK setting.
The implications for understanding development as people grow up and become parents and for the delivery of health care are examined.

The learning that takes place during the years before children start school has been shown to directly influence their later achievements during the school years.
This project focuses on recent findings that in particular, preschool children's knowledge of nursery rhymes is a very good predictor of their success in learning to read.
A group of 100 children aged initially two years will be studied longitudinally over a 30 month period, with the aim of identifying the social and cognitive factors influencing the way in which nursery rhymes and counting sequences are learned.
Particular emphasis will be placed upon an evaluation of whether young children's skills at remembering verbal material for a short period constrains their abilities to learn such verbal sequences, and so may indirectly mediate the link between nursery rhyme knowledge and later reading ability.
In addition, it will be possible to chart in these children the emergence of early awareness of the sound structure of words, and to identify the cognitive and social precursors of this phonological awareness.

Psychological research on human thinking suggests two alternative views of the machinery of the mind; one is that the mental representations and cognitive processes are abstract, language-like forms manipulated by rules, and an alternative is that they are mental models whose structure corresponds not to language but to states of affairs in the world.
The objective of the project is to examine the nature of the representations and processes that underline meta- deduction: an important higher-order form of reasoning.
Meta-deduction enables reasoners to make inferences about other people's inferences, which is relevant to almost every successful social and professional interaction.
Meta-deduction depends on two components: an ability to make deductions, and an ability to construct reasoning strategies.
Experiments will be carried out on the nature and development of the strategies that reasoners learn to construct, and on the sources of difficulty in making meta-deductions.
The results will enable the development of a theory of the cognitive processes underlying meta-deduction, which will be implemented in a computer program.

Mental work such as reading is best undertaken in silence; modestly loud extraneous noise may be distracting, even though the person may be trying to ignore it.
Recent work has shown that a range of mental activities, typical of those that might be found in an office, are at appreciable risk from such distraction.
The loss of efficiency can be as much as 30% in some cases.
It has been suggested that some sounds are distracting than others and that there are certain kinds of mental activity that are more at risk than others.
This ESRC-sponsored project was designed to investigate these claims.
Speech has previously been shown to be particularly distracting, but research from the project has shown that the effect is not confined to speech, non-speech sounds show the effect also.
Project experiments have shown that any sound can be distracting as long has it has two characteristics: that is varies on content and that the stream of sound can be broken up (or segmented) into separate entities.
Therefore, a continuous sound, even though it might vary in its pitch, is less distracting than the same sound interspersed with silence.
Additionally, the project has also been able to localise successfully the disruption to those tasks in which the order of information has to be preserved.
The project is part of a wider concern about how sound impinges uninvited on memory and how material from the eye and the ear are combined by the brain.
Results from the project have had a direct influence on the development of a new model of human memory.

Stereotypes, structured sets of beliefs about social groups, can be viewed as categories that can bias the way we process information, organize and store it in memory, and make judgements about members of those categories.
This project deals with two neglected questions.
First, what are the conditions under which typically negative expectancies are formed?
Planned studies will compare strength of stereotype formation, when the same amount of information about a novel group is either concentrated in a small number of salient individuals, or dispersed across several members of the group.
This variable will be investigated together with cognitive (eg., information over-load), evaluative (eg., nature of the stereotype), affective (eg., mood) and motivational (eg., interaction goals) factors.
Second, what are the cognitive and affective processes involved in stereotype change?
Studies will compare concentrated vs dispersed patterns of information which disconfirms a stereotype.
These studies will also investigate processing factors (eg., focus on individuals vs group), evaluative content of stereotype (positive vs negative) and induced mood.
Complementary studies will test two models of intergroup contact, by comparing interaction under conditions that highlight or de-emphasize group memberships and personal identities (eg., competition vs cooperation; majority vs minority status).
A feature of the research will be the use of cognitive experimental techniques to measure response times, memory and the perceived variability of groups; and the collection of observational data as members of natural groups interact under various conditions.

The aim of the project is to evaluate how users understand, manipulate, and respond to maps produced by geographical information systems (GIS).
GIS is an information system which stores, manages and retrieves spatially indexed data.
The graphical output of GIS is a map.
The project will compare expert and novice users' responses to several GIS map displays on a range of map evaluation task.
Both census and urban data bases will be used.
The project is intended to represent a modest prototype for the evaluation of GIS-type map displays.
With the advent of GIS, it will be increasingly possible for non-cartographers to produce their own maps.
The research will begin to examine not only how people use maps, but also how they create them.
Finally, the project will study a wide range of users with different levels of expertise.
The purpose is to trace the development of expertise in the comprehension and use of GIS-generated maps.
This will have implications for the training of future GIS users, and for graphicacy education in general.

There has been an assumption that young visually impaired children have little or no ability to use tactile maps to find their way around, and it has been argued that there is little to be gained from introducing visually impaired children to maps at an early age.
Conventionally, maps and graphic aids are introduced into mobility work only in middle childhood, if at all.
However, our own recent research has demonstrated that visually impaired children can start to understand and use simple maps from 6 or 7 years of age.
The present research has been proposed so that a more detailed and extensive study of young visually impaired children's spatial and map abilities can be carried out.
In particular the research will
(i)
examine at what age, and how, visually impaired children should be introduced to tactile maps,
(ii)
consider how tactile maps can contribute to the mobility and independence of visually impaired children,
(iii)
investigate the difficulties which children may have in using tactile maps and consider how these difficulties can be overcome by help and training,
(iv)
examine other aids to mobility (e.g. special compasses designed for the visually impaired).
It is expected that the results of the research will have important implications for teaching visually impaired children how to find their way around the world and will be a beneficial contribution to contemporary mobility training.

In a study of several hundred German and British middle to senior managers in diverse companies in the UK and Germany, Professor Cary L.
Cooper from the Manchester School of Management, UMIST, and Dr. Bruce D. Kirkcaldy (Ruhr University, Bochum, West Germany) examined national differences in job stress, work satisfaction and physical and mental health.
The data collection coincided with a period of increasing structural tensions associated with a period of increasing structural tensions associated with reorganisations and amalgamations due to a re-unifying Germany.
Just as Germany was experiencing specific sources of job-related stress due to re-unification, so too in the UK where there has been a trend towards mergers and acquisitions between the UK and other European countries as the European Economic Community becomes a greater reality.
In what ways did the countries differ?
Perhaps not surprisingly, the Germans expressed higher sources of job-related stress particularly in terms of pressure arising from the ‘home-work interface’, ‘organisational structure and climate’ and ‘career and achievement’.
The German managers were further less satisfied with the ‘job itself’ and ‘organisational processes’.
Both British and German managers were characterised by high achievement motivation and competitiveness, combined with a strong personal belief about feeling able to control their work setting, when compared to population norms.
Interestingly, German managers whilst not showing any difference in their feelings of physical health, did show superior psychological health compared to their British counterparts, and these appear to be due to their more frequently and effectively using stress-coping techniques such as‘social support’, ‘task strategies’, ‘time’ and ‘involvement’.
In addition, British executives are inclined to show a weak demarcation between their work and leisure areas, in contrast to the Germans who selected to ‘compensate’ more, selecting leisure activities in counterposition to work.
Dr. Kirkcaldy and Professor Cooper both hope to pursue the studies further with personnel from the private and public sector, which may provide interesting insights into why the economic development of both countries might be different.

Human short-term memory is used on a wide variety of psychological tasks such as reading and mental arithmetic.
However, despite a considerable amount of research, there is as yet no theoretical model of the relevant processes that is explicit enough to be expressed in the form of a computer program.
This contrasts with work on word reading, where impressive recent advances have resulted from an interaction between computational modelling and experimental psychology.
The purpose of this research is to develop a theoretical model of human short-term memory, expressed in the form of a computer program, and to undertake psychological experiments to test the predictions of the model.
The computational modelling approach will ‘parallel distributed processing’ architectures, and will be aimed at counting for a wide variety of existing empirical data.
The research will be of general educational relevance, and will also have important implications for the clinical use of short-term memory span tests as a measure of short-term memory capacity.

Dr. Peter Collett and Dr. Michael Argyle at the Department of Experimental Psychology, Oxford University, have been awarded an ESRC grant to study the problems that British businessmen and women experience in Europe.
The first phase of the research project will focus on Euro-commuters and the range of difficulties they encounter, the problems associated with specific countries, and what they have learned from their business dealings on the continent.
The second phase of the project will focus on the actual dynamics of problem incidents.
In-depth interviews will be conducted with British and continental businessmen and women in order to uncover differences in value orientations and business conventions that have led to cultural misunderstandings in the past.
The third and final phase of the project will be devoted to the construction of an interactive training package which will be used to alert business personnel to the kinds of problems they are likely to encounter, the reasons why people on the continent behave differently, and the most effective approaches to take when doing business on the continent.

This research will build upon the Manchester Down's Syndrome Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of a representative sample of children with Down's syndrome and their families, from the birth of children between 1973 and 1980 to the present time.
The previous work on the cohort demonstrated how key family and child factors related to successful or unsuccessful family functioning.
The present study aims to continue this investigation during adolescence of the children with Down's syndrome.
It will focus on parental stress, child functioning, family relationships and quality of life and sibling adaptation.
The relationships between these measures and family resources, child, family and parental characteristics and parental coping strategies will be explored using multivariable statistical analyses.
The longitudinal data will be utilised to investigate change over time and the factors which predict good or poor outcome.
Data will be collected by means of questionnaires to mother and fathers and interviews with mothers and siblings.
These will form the basis of a comprehensive family assessment procedure for use in research and practice.

This project builds on two earlier projects funded by the ESRC.
All three address the problem that high achievement in school science and mathematics depend on students having achieved a high enough level of intellectual ability by the time they are 14.
Earlier research has shown that only to 30% of the student population reach this level.
The CASE projects aim at least to double this proportion in the first three years of secondary schooling by developing new teaching skills in science teachers.
During CASE II it was shown that an intervention in years 7 to 9 was accompanied in year 11 by a doubling of the proportion achieving C- grade of above in GCSE Science, with related increases in Mathematics and English.
CASE III is a teacher/researcher collaboration to describe in rich detail the teaching skills required to realise the project aims.
British Petroleum have allocated 45,000 to the production of an inservice pack including professional video-recordings of selected lessons embodying CASE principles.
The work of the project will be included in the INSET pack to be launched in May 1993 and the theoretical implications are discussed in a book ‘Really raising standards’ to be published by Routledge.

Spatial information can be held in immediate memory and reproduced accurately, just as verbal material can, although verbal immediate memory has received much more research attention.
Maintenance of information in verbal memory is based on sub-vocal rehearsal of material held in a fading phonological store and it has been suggested that maintenance of spatial information in memory over short periods is also carried out by an active control process based on a response system.
This research project investigates the suggestion that such spatial rehearsal is primarily motor in nature and that factors which influence the time to rehearse an item will also affect memory span.
In the study factors affecting the time taken to move spatial targets will be manipulated, and interference with spatial memory will be investigated.
The tasks used are spatial memory tasks which are normally used with neuropsychological patients, and it is hoped that the project will lead to a clearer understanding of the nature of spatial impairments following brain injury by clarifying the processing of spatial information presented simultaneously and sequentially.

Virtually all large organisations make forecasts.
They often rely on a combination of formal computer-based procedures and judgement.
However, small businesses also need to forecast and they are more likely to rely on judgement alone.
This is because quantitative techniques are seen as more costly (in terms of money, time and mental work load), more complex and (perhaps wrongly) as more inaccurate than judgmental methods.
Errors in forecasting can have dire consequences and are often the focus of the organisation in question.
The project will examine how well people can use their judgement to forecast the future behaviour of a system (eg. a business, economy or traffic system) on the basis of a series of observations that characterize its past behaviour.
Experiments based on computer simulations will be used to do this.
The main research questions concern how forecasting performance depends on the statistical nature of the series, what psychological processes underlie that performance, how well people can assess the quality of their forecasts and whether forecasting skill can be learned or trained.

Being able to put a name to a subject is something that is beyond the capabilities of any current computer system.
This is because object naming is a surprisingly complex task.
It requires the seen object to be matched with stored memories of the usual appearance of known objects, the retrieval of information about the object's function and our associations with it, and the retrieval of information about the object's name.
Knowing how these processes are organized will help us develop better computer systems for object naming, in addition to helping us understand how object naming develops in children, and how it can break down after brain damage.
The project will involve investigation of how object naming operates in adults.
Experiments will examine the speed and accuracy with which different kinds of object are named, using newly developed techniques for speeded responding (forcing people to give the first name they think of in response to a picture).
These techniques allow us to examine recognition and name retrieval processes in detail.
The experiments will be linked to attempts to develop computer models which simulate object naming processes in humans.

Research over the last sixty years has demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that, for many people, unemployment is responsible for deterioration in mental and physical health.
The nature of the causal mechanism is however less well understood.
This research is designed to contribute to the understanding of the role of social psychological aspects of income in the experience and mental and physical health of families living on low income.
The researchers are comparing the results gained from depth interviews, validated measures of well-being, detailed records of income and expenditure and other sources in both low income employed and unemployed families.
In this way they are exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and issues such as experienced relative poverty, income related stigma, perceived (non) entitlements, spending and consumption patterns and attitudes, the domestic division of family economic management, coping strategies and budgeting tactics.
Benefit advice is available to participants as part of the research.

Over the last 15 years ESRC has funded a number of projects concerned with the ways we identify others from their faces.
This has led both to exciting theoretical work on the processes underlying face recognition and useful practical work on the way faces are learned and what things affect the way witnesses to a crime remember the culprits.
This project will also be primarily addressed at discovering how we recognise voices.
Here some effort will be made to explore the theoretical significance of the commonly-experienced phenomenon of hearing a voice and knowing that it is familiar but not knowing to whom it belongs.
By taking advantage of this tip-of-the-tongue state and other phenomenon it is expected that a model of voice recognition will be derived.
Although we now know a great deal about person identification by face, we know very little about voice identification and almost nothing about how face and voice information are combined.
This project will also attempt to establish just how information from the two modalities converge by systematically manipulating them in such a way as to disrupt the normal manner of combining them.
Some experiments will be conducted where video sequences of voice and face do not match; and, in order to evaluate the primacy of face over voice, the onset of each will be varied.

Considerable effort is directed at teaching primary schoolchildren about the danger of ‘strangers’, yet relatively little is known about their concepts of and beliefs about ‘strangers’.
Formal training efforts may fail to address the conceptual difficulties that young children have, particularly, in making fine, abstract discriminations, and there are some indications that the perceived gap between ‘stranger’ and ‘non-stranger’may be very small indeed.
Aspects of social and physical context, and of verbal exchange, may affect their judgment.
In addition, if children are ‘successfully’ taught that strangers can be harmful, is there the unwritten (and worrying) implication that all non-strangers are harmless?
This study extends a methodology previously used by the researchers and will involve presenting to children of different ages a number of filmed sequences of encounters with strangers, varying context, type of approach etc.
Their reactions will be judged by independent experts.
Additionally, their constructs about strangers will be ‘mapped’ using a sorting technique (the repertory grid technique).
Finally, two sets of adults most involved with the formal teaching of ‘stranger-danger’, viz. primary schoolteachers and community involvement police officers, will be asked to repeat the experimental tasks, predicting how children would respond, in order to compare their predictions with the children's actual responses.

This seminar, held in March 1991, at the Kings Fund Centre, London, brought together social researchers, policy makers and practitioners to examine the implications of recent psychosocial and health promotion research for policy and practice in relation to young people and HIV/AIDS.
Two papers were presented in each of the three themes:
(i)
Young peopleeliefs and attitudes about HIV/AIDS,
(ii)
Young peopleisk behaviour and
(iii)
Young people and HIV/AIDS health promotion.
Presentations identified findings from recent research activity, and pointed to their potential implications for Youth policy as well as work with young people in and out of school.
A range of projects funded by ESRC as part of its AIDS initiative were represented at the seminar, as were projects funded by other organisations.
A round table discussion concluded the seminar.

In the last ten years it has become apparent that there is some stability and continuity in intellectual and cognitive functioning from infancy through early and later childhood.
The research to date in this ‘exciting and contemporary field of enquiry’ has been piecemeal or ‘bitty’, and the purpose of the research is to put this area of enquiry on a sound experimental footing.
The research has four major, interrelated aims.
These are:
(1)
To clarify our understanding of the predictive validity of measures of attention in early infancy (birth to 6 months) for children's later cognitive functioning;
(2)
To develop measures of infants' cognitive ability in the age range 6-18 months which can be used
(a)
to explore the interdependence or otherwise of different areas of cognitive growth, and
(b)
for assessment purposes;
(3)
To extend our understanding of the ways in which environmental stimulation and caretaker activities influence infants' cognitive growth;
(4)
To develop a test of infant's cognitive development which would have major uses both theoretically and as a screening measure.
The research will be carried out in collaboration with Professor Marc Bornstein, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Washington, DC.

It is most important to understand the impact of divorce upon children and adolescents: some 170,000 children in England and Wales are dealt with each year under existing legislation relating to access and custody orders.
Furthermore, the recent implementation of the Children Act (1989) makes new research particularly timely e.g., the Act emphasises that parenthood for both mother and father continues even when marriage does not.
Good research is surprisingly sparse.
In particular, the divorcing parents who have been interviewed have tended to be those who requested counselling or mediation, the ages of their children have been very diverse, and the use of non-divorcing families as ‘controls’ is rare.
This research involves the interviewing of the 12-14 year old children of divorce and both parents, matched with a sample of ‘intact’ families using a longitudinal design.
The following questions will be answered during the course of the research: 1) What is the role, function and importance of both the non-custodial parent and custodial parent and how do these change in the period following divorce? 2) What types of conflict and what types of co-operation can be identified between parents following divorce, and what impact does each type have upon both adolescent adjustment? 3) What types of support are available to the children and how are they used?
The present study is not only covering new ground in concentrating on a single age-group — teenagers — but is also the first study in the U.K. to extensively interview both parents and children from a sample of divorced and intact families.

Recent research suggests that between 3-5 years, children show radical changes in their ideas about the nature of mental states and how these states influence behaviour.
Much work has been done on children's understanding of how a person's beliefs determine that person's actions, but less is known about their conception of the role of motivation in action.
By interviewing young children, and asking them to explain story characters' actions, the project aims to investigate changes in children's psychological explanations of action.
Very young children understand how a desire can direct a person's actions, but they seem to see desire as an inherent property of an object, rather than as one individual's subjective evaluation of the object.
The research evaluates the claim that the latter view emerges at around 4 years and that as a consequence, children's views about motivation will change in three ways.
Firstly, children should be able to establish reasons why there are individual differences in personality traits and emotional reactions.
Secondly, children should develop a new appreciation of how traits can be used to explain behaviour.
Thirdly, they should develop new ideas about how existing desires and preferences are affected by influences such as persuasion and coercion.

Considerable attention has been paid in recent years to the psychology of women, to the development of feminine gender identity and to the conflicts involved in women's dual roles as carers and workers.
In comparison there has been very little work on the psychology of masculinity and the nature of male identity, although both men (and women) are becoming increasingly interested in the forms masculinity might assume in the 1990s and beyond.
This project will study two different groups of men and aims to describe the strategies each group adopts in establishing a masculine identity.
The responses of a sample of young men (17-18 year olds) and a more heterogeneous group of older men to images of masculinity found in popular culture will first be investigated.
The project will also examine the responses of these two groups to heterosexual relationships and their roles in relationships and will look at responses to feminism and other challenges to the traditional conceptions of women's and men's different social positions.
Overall, the project aims to investigate how the public position of men affects private and subjective self-images and self-perceptions, and to incorporate a psychological dimension into studies of men's lives found sociology and cultural studies.

This project will investigate the development of verb-phrase anaphora in the language of children between the ages of 4 and 10 years.
Verb-phrase anaphora occurs when a verb-phrase depends for its interpretation on another verb-phrase occurring earlier in the spoken or written discourse.
For example, in the sentence: Mary ate a banana and John did too, the verb-phrase -did too — refers back to the earlier verb-phrase — ate a banana.
By linking different parts of a discourse together and by reducing redundancy, verb-phrase anaphora contributes to the cohesion of the discourse (that is, the extent to which it flows and holds together).
If children are to develop effective communication skills (in speaking, listening, reading and writing), it is vital that they acquire the ability to produce cohesive devices, such as verb-phrase anaphora, appropriately.
The acquisition of verb-phrase anaphora has not been investigated in previous research, although there has been some research into the acquisition of other cohesive devices such as conjunctions (e.g. because) and pronouns (e.g. he/she).
Children will be asked to complete sentences to describe pictures (designed to elicit uses of verb-phrase anaphora) and to answer questions about sentences containing verb-phrase anaphora.
Comparisons will be made between children's responses to spoken and written versions of the tasks, between their production and their comprehension of verb-phrase anaphora, and between age-groups.

The ease with which humans recognise faces hides the complexity of this task.
We have an impressive ability to recognise those familiar to us over a wide variety of conditions: for example varying lighting conditions, viewing angles, cosmetic changes (hairstyles or make-up) and even age.
In order for this to be useful, we have to access information relevant to the faces we recognise: is this a friend, a relative, some national celebrity?
What is the person's name?
There is now a well-developed body of theory which explains many aspects of the identification of people from their faces.
However, this theory largely ignores the process of learning new faces and new identities.
Like other theories of visual object recognition and word recognition, it concentrates on the processes which allow us to access already learned information, rather than enquiring how such information becomes stored in the first place.
However, even during adulthood we are constantly learning the faces of new individuals, both personal acquaintances and media figures.
Theories which ignore this facility cannot be complete.
This project will investigate the processes involved in face learning.
Using both experimental studies and computer simulation, existing theories of face recognition and learning in general will be evaluated and developed.
The aim is to provide an account of the stages by which a face becomes integrated into our ‘database’ of known people, an account which will build upon what is already known about face recognition.
If successful, it will produce a deeper understanding of the human face recognition system.
However, the implications of the work extend beyond theories of face recognition to theories of visual object and word recognition.

The ability to generalise is fundamental to all forms of intelligence and has been studied within the mind sciences for at least two thousand yeas (since Aristotle).
Today it has become the focus of work on machine intelligence, particularly within connectionism.
Indeed, a measure of generalisation is now used as the benchmark for connectionist models.
However, there are two factors which severely limit the growth of a connectionist theory of generalisation.
The first limiting factor is the simplistic method that until now has been employed in the assessment of the generalisation ability of connectionist models, together with a lack of research on generalisation per se.
And the second, more serious factor, is attributable to the emphasis in connectionist research on generalisation ‘within' task domains rather than with generalisation ‘between’ task domains.
Cross-task generalisation is fundamental to intelligence.
A system that cannot generalise between task domains cannot be intelligent.
We propose to overcome these limitations through the use of a new methodology for the assessment of connectionist networks.
This methodology has been devised during years of extensive psychological work on the assessment of the transfer of learning from one task to another.
The adoption of these methods within connectionist research will make an important contribution to development of a unified theory of generalisation.

British infancy research has a well-established National, European and International reputation, and this has been built up by many eminent researchers working separately at their different institutions.
The purpose of this project is to hold two two-day symposia, one in 1992, the next in 1993, in order to bring together both the most active British researchers, and also research students and research assistants working in infancy research.
The international aims of the symposia are the following: To promote inter-institutional collaborative research; To allow junior researchers to meet and discuss with established researchers; To engender interest in, and enthusiasm for, infancy research; To produce publications, with contributions from the symposium attenders; To serve as a major focus for infancy research in this country.
The first meeting will be in Exeter, 6-8th July 1992, and its focus will be on Perceptual, Cognitive, Social, and Language Development in Infancy.

Texts contain simple sentences, like ‘John likes the dog’, and complex sentences, like ‘This is the dog that John likes’.
Understanding the second sentence involves understanding that the object of ‘likes’ is ‘dog’, a word which appeared earlier.
Skilled readers are only occasionally conscious of misunderstanding a complex sentence, or having difficulty in finding the correct association such as that between ‘likes’ and ‘dog’.
There are complex constraints in the grammar of English which determine whether or not such associations can be made.
If these constraints are violated, the sentence is ungrammatical.
Readers possess some implicit version of this grammar.
They can understand sentences and tell if they are grammatical or not.
There are severe limits on what simple introspection can tell us about reading, however.
Tasks which require subjects to read and respond to sentences and which furnish precise data on the time course of their reading, are able to reveal much more about sentence processing.
We will be employing an eye-tracking technique to study reading of complex sentences.
This technique records the exact points in the sentence which the reader fixates, and the time of each fixation.
The research will take place in the University of Glasgow's Psychology Department.
There is close collaboration between the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Cognitive Science and the University of Glasgow's Psychology Department, in the form of the Human Communication Research Centre, based at the University of Edinburgh.

In manpower intensive service sector industries with many small outlets, significant improvements in productivity may be achieved by training to optimise human resources.
Centralised training, however, is costly, sometimes unavailable for specific industries and, to be effective, requires reinforcement at work.
Success is usually assessed by participants rather than by pragmatic managerial measurement of improvement.
The research aims to develop and evaluate a behaviour-modelling programme to implement ‘on-job’ human resource training in the service sector.
Video programmes exemplifying optimal approaches to particular customer relations problems are being developed, together with a training package by structured practice.
The training promises to provide empirical evidence of incremental improvements in staff effectiveness.
Managerial measurements of behavioural change will be cross-checked by sampling customer reaction.
Research is being carried out with the Co-operative Bank but it is expected that the technique will be readily transferable within the service sector.
Further work is being conducted to examine the use of behaviour-modelling training for a range of subject matter, and to explore the determinants of effective training and the transfer to the work situation.

In the second year of life, children start to engage in pretence.
For example, they pretend to feed a doll or to drink from an (empty) cup.
This ability is very striking because it shows clearly that young children can think about a non-existent or counterfactual situation.
Most research on pretence has examined the child's ability to produce a pretend action.
However, children also start to play games of pretend with other people.
To do this, they need to work out what their partner is doing, when for example, he or she lifts an empty cup to their lips, or tilts an empty teapot above the cup.
The research project will focus on children's comprehension of pretence.
Children will be asked to watch and then describe such simple pretend episodes.
This will show whether they produce a literal description,(‘You lifted the teapot') or whether they can appropriately describe the action and its consequences non-literally (‘You poured tea into the cup').
The experiments will include autistic children who allegedly have great difficulties with pretence.
The findings should indicate whether children can use language to describe fictional and not just actual situations.

Neural networks, or connectionist models, have been increasingly influential in the last few years in the description and investigation of language processing.
They may be used to develop sophisticated statistical representations of particular domains such as orthography, phonology or semantics and the relationships between them.
The manner in which a mapping may be made between, for instance, orthographic and phonological representations captures many aspects of human behaviour in pronouncing written words, in both normal and abnormal (dyslexic) reading.
The proposed research will involve the study of the processing of speech, in order to capture psycholinguistic data.
Connectionist modellers have concentrated more on the processing of static input, to date.
Speech occurs across time.
The modelling proposed will take an abstract representation of speech input and investigate the statistical regularities inherent in such a low-level, pre-lexical representation of speech.
A corpus of transcribed conversational speech (the London-Lund corpus) will be converted into an idealized phonological form, based on Kaye's Government Phonology, for this purpose.
The mapping of this input, as it unfolds across time, onto other domains such as semantics will then be studied.
The aim will be to capture the processing carried on by listeners as speech is processed and word-meanings identified.

This project draws particularly on the discipline of philosophy and on major findings in the field of neuropsychology in an attempt to clarify ‘designerly’ ways of knowing.
The project began with an epistemological comparison of design with science, based on the philosophy of science, and went on to outline the ‘logic’ of intuition and creativity.
It then turned to establishing the modes and media of thought in design and to an outline of some neurological bases of design ability.
The project concluded with an attempt to match design ability against some criterea for distinct types of ‘intelligence’, in an attempt to establish design intelligence as one of those distinct types.
By applying relevant insights and procedures from philosophy, the project seeks to clarify the component elements of an epistemology of design ‘know-how’, to develop a taxonomy of design knowledge, and to formulate the basis of a satisfactory design epistemology.

In this project we shall examine what preconceptions teenagers have about driving and how these preconceptions change as a functions of age and first-hand experience of driving.
It is assumed that the personal and social significance of transport in general and driving in particular develops rapidly between the ages of 13 and 19, and that the knowledge, attitudes and judgements relating to driving that develop during these years will have an important bearing on how young drivers behave on the road.
The proposed research will focus on teenagers judgements attitudes and beliefs relating to driving and sanctions for bad driving.Approximately 200 teenagers in each of four age groups (13, 15, 17, and 19) will be studies.
Half the teenagers in each age group will be recruited from the Manchester region, the other half from the Glasgow region.
The methods used will involve a combination of questionnaires, interviews, and judgements about traffic situations presented via interactive video.
The research should contribute both to psychological knowledge, by identifying the structure and content of teenagers' knowledge of road use and how this knowledge changes as a function of experience; to the practical business of accident prevention, by identifying what kinds of interventions are most needed in pre-driving years and when these interventions are most likely to be effective.

The aim of this research is to explore children's developing understanding of the concept of secrets, the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’secrets, the social and motivational factors governing the keeping, sharing and divulging of information.
In other words, we shall be exploring the cognitive and affective factors which influence how children of different ages (5, 8 and 11 year-olds) understand and make decisions about secrecy.
To what extent are children aware of the intentions and consequences of the social contract in which secrecy is enacted?
The results of this research will have practical implications for current educational programmes aimed at the prevention of sexual and other forms of child abuse, and theoretical significance for our understanding of children's theory of mind.

It has been shown that anxious individuals rend to interpret ambiguous stimuli in line with a threatening interpretation if one is available.
The technique used in the current project is based upon our previous work.
using a priming technique, showing that anxious individuals interpret threat/neutral homographs in terms of their threatening meaning.
This involved presenting a priming word just prior to a target letter string.
The subject indicated whether the target was a word.
On such trials, subjects respond more quickly if the prime and target are related than unrelated, presumably reflecting a spread of semantic activation within the cognitive system.
The technique can be employed to investigate which interpretation of homographs is activated by presenting ambiguous primes followed by words related to one or other meaning.
Faster responses will only be found for the activated meaning
(s)
.
The current project will extend previous work by presenting the homograph primes so briefly that the subjects are not consciously aware of them.
If such subliminal presentations can be shown to influence processing of subsequent information in anxious subjects, it would strongly support the suggestion that anxiety-related biases occur at a very early stage of information processing.

This study is being conducted in collaboration with Professor J Misumi of the University of Osaka and Professor M Peterson of Texas Tech University.
In each country, organisations are compared which are locally owned, and Japanese owned.
All organisations studied are electronics assembly plants.
Measures are being obtained within each organisation of the styles of managerial leadership, the specific behaviours which leaders most frequently use and performance measures for work teams and for the organisation as a whole.
The study will provide answers relevant to two questions:
(1)
how similar are the leader styles associated with effective performance in Britain, USA and Japan?
(2)
how far are the specific behaviours associated with particular leadership styles the same in each country?
The findings should make more specific our understanding of the degree to which current Japanese management practice has lessons for Western organisations.

This project involves the development of a collaboration begun in 1981 between British and French teams with the aim of extending the theory of social representations (Moscovici, 1981) to an interpretation of children's socio-moral concepts and beliefs.
The research examines children's interpretations and judgements of aspects of the social environment.
This involves a cross-national comparison based on samples of 7-12 year olds in Britain and France and drawn from middle and working class backgrounds.
It is concerned with social representations among children of the social world relating to the school and to occupations, and with the impact of these on moral judgements.

In the real world people frequently have to chose an alternative in a situation where rewards and penalties for right and wrong decisions must be considered.
People will usually choose in a way which is consistent, but not in their own best interests since they fail to take into account all relevant information.
The aim of the research is to build mathematical models of how such decisions are actually made.
The models will then be tested by comparing their predictions with the behaviour of people making idealised decisions in the laboratory.
The models describe the way people learn by experience in terms of how they are affected by the sequence of sums of money received as rewards for correct decisions or lost as penalty for errors.
The models also describe the exact form of the deterioration in decision making which occurs when people have to choose among several alternatives instead of just two, in terms of limits on their memory and thinking.
A longer term goal of the research is to give a general mathematical formulation of how people allocate their thinking resources and to explore the implications for economic behaviour.

Social work practice in the field of child care has been the subject of considerable criticism in recent years, particularly with regard to the process by which important decisions about children in care are reached.
This process is complicated by the differences in salary, qualification and experience which exist between field social workers who hold legal responsibility for such children and their residential colleagues who provide care for those children who are placed in children's homes.
The research aims to examine the consequences for working relationships between these two groups of a major reorganisation of child care services introduced by Kent Social Services Department.
A range of services is being provided from local Family Support Centres which will offer short term care for children on a basis of clear, early decision making, with the close involvement of natural parents and based on an assumption that residential and field workers will be working closely together in planning and providing help for the children and their families.
By interviewing social workers in two such Family Support Centres shortly after the policy has been introduced and again twelve months later, it will be possible to measure the extent of any changes in their patterns of work and in their professional identities.
In particular, this will show whether greater proximity has broken down some of the barriers which have traditionally existed between the two groups or, as some theorists have suggested, has led to a re-definition of their differences.

Two classes of explanation for social behaviour can be identified.
One (‘intrapsychic') is based on the premise that an individual's social behaviour is determined by his/her internal needs (eg a desire to hold the ‘correct’ attitude).
The other (‘impression management') is based on the premise that an individual's social behaviour is determined by his/her wish to create or sustain a social identity (eg a desire to be seen to hold a certain attitude.
Although much effort has been expended in the search for ‘crucial’ experiments that would support one of these exaplanations at the expense of the other, Tetlock and Manstead (Psychological Review, 1985) have shown that none of six methodological strategies adopted to date is capable of yielding such decisive evidence.
It is therefore argued that social psychologists should treat these two types of explanation as special cases of a more general explanatory framework termed ‘identity control’ theory.
Within this framework, individuals are seen as monitoring their behaviour with reference to private and public standards.
Which standard is salient depends on the individual's dispositions and the situation at hand.
Perceived discrepancy between behaviour and standard triggers change designed to reduce such discrepancy.
The aim of the present research is to develop this framework by deriving testable propositions and conducting appropriate experiments.

Many questions about emotions remain unanswered, such as, why are some people unhappy whilst others in similar circumstances are happy?
Where do emotions come from?
Can anything be done to improve levels of happiness?, and so on.
Although a lot of research has been devoted to understanding negative emotions such as anxiety or depression, very little time has been spent on finding out what makes people happy.
This research project aims to do just that, by looking at positive rather than negative emotions.
Positive emotions will be studied with the use of questionnaires, diaries, interviews, and laboratory experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of the different emotions experienced by people when they are ‘feeling good’.
The investigation of the sources of these emotions will provide information about how happiness can most effectively be pursued.
By looking at external events such as social interation, work and leisure, the project will reveal what engenders positive emotions.
Furthermore, identification of the sources of happiness will provide a basis for understanding the duration of certain emotions in connection with particular events in life.
For instance, does praise make you feel good for an hour, a day, a week or longer?
Does serious leisure produce satisfaction of greater ‘depth’?
One important source of pleasure will be investigated in some detail — television watching.
It appears that people gain ‘para-social’ pleasure from imagining that they know the characters featured in long-running series.
These characters become real, and may give the lonely viewer the benefits normally derived from being with other people.
In summary, the research project will gather information about the nature of happiness, its sources, the duration of emotions after certain events, and the effects of anticipating certain events, as well as the effect of television viewing.

The role that television plays in family life is being studied by videotaping people in their own homes.
A cabinet containing a television set, a camera, a video cassette recorder and other equipment has been installed in twenty homes.
The video material that has been collected (about 350 hours of tape so far) is presently being analysed with a view to understanding
(a)
the relationship between the amount of television people claim to watch and how much they actually watch,
(b)
the relationship between how much time people spend watching a programme and how much they enjoy it,
(c)
how certain activities complement or conflict with television watching,
(d)
how viewers divide their attention between the demands of family life and the television,
(e)
the resolution of family conflicts over channel choice, etc.

The project is concerned with the functions and implications of explanations.
Based on the investigator's previous theoretical and empirical work, this project investigates the perceived consequences of different sorts of explanation, specifies the functions of explanations and examines the relationship between attribution and action.
The studies are being carried out with reference to explanations for criminal acts and educational outcomes and are being explored in an inter-group context.

Contemporary research in experimental psychology has tended to neglect two important aspects of human nature: the long-term organisation of behaviour, and the part played by emotional states and changes in directing the course of people's actions.
The former is relatively difficult to investigate in the normal research framework of brief laboratory experiments, and the latter has been overshadowed by the large volume of research on rational information processing, using analogies between computers and the mind.
This project, which follows on from a number of years of ESRC funded research in the same group, on the psychology of communication and relationships, aims to explore and to unify these two areas.
The investigators have put forward a theory suggesting that the gross organisation of human action is carried out by different parts of the mind from the fine detailed planning and control of behaviour, and that it is governed by emotional factors to a much greater extent than people had realised.
The details of the theory give rise to a number of testable predictions which are the basis of five interrelated experimental studies.
For example, it is predicted that certain kinds of ‘life strategies’ will be found most commonly in people in whom particular corresponding moods or emotions predominate, and that the more general the strategies are, the stronger their association will be with the emotional rather than the intellectual characteristics of the person.
The research has practical implications for the training and working practices of teachers, doctors, nurses, social workers and the caring professions in general, as well as for decision research, business management, and various types of administration.

This study is concerned with the way Pakeha (white) New Zealanders make sense of race and race related issues, such as the violent protests against the Springbok tour, Polynesian and British immigration, and the position of New Zealand Maoris.
A variety of data bases are involved: transcripts of 40 open-ended interviews with middle-class Pakehas; transcripts of 30 interviews with final year school students as well as with some teachers working in multi-ethnic classrooms; parliamentary debates and media reports relating to the Springbok tour, Maori affairs and immigration issues.
These will be studied by way of a fine-grain computer-aided analysis of discourse to reveal the recurrent forms of explanation used.
The objectives are,
(1)
to clarify the content of Pakeha's representations of intergroup conflict, racial and immigration issues, focusing particularly on the way explanations are organised in discourse;
(2)
to contribute to debates over the role of cognitive factors in social perception;
(3)
to extend Tajfel's analysis of the justificatory functions of majority group stereotypes of minority groups.
In addition, it will provide information of practical value for designing anti-racist educational materials.

The aim of this project is to link, for the first time, social psychological models of situation perception to the controversy in personality theory concerning consistency of behaviour across situations.
It is proposed that a person's behaviour varies across situations in a characteristic and systematic way depending on the subjective perception and interpretation of the respective situation.
To test this hypothesis, measures of perceived similarity or difference between situations are required which may subsequently be related to measures of similarity or difference in a person's behaviour across the same set of situations.
Three recent models addressing different aspects of the subjective perception of situations in terms of similarity and difference are applied to the task of measuring the interpretation of situations on an individual level.
The area of anxiety is selected as the personality domain in which the proposed relationship between situation perception and behaviour will be examined.
After listing anxiety-provoking situations from their personal experience, participants in the study will describe their perceptions of these situations in terms of the three theoretical models.
They will then be asked to report their behaviour for each of the situations.
The extent to which situational similarity on the perceptual side corresponds with similarity in the behavioural reports indicates individual consistency across situations.

There has been considerable interest in social psychology to examine the processes involved in social thinking.
This work has completely neglected the role that language plays in social thinking and the aim of this project is to redress this imbalance.
The implications of this work are far-ranging.
The types of issues that are involved concern not only theoretical issues revolving around the construction of social reality, conceptualization of personality and how humans process social information, but also methodological problems such as questionnaire and inventory design, for example in personality assessment.

People are generally very efficient at remembering faces.
The aim of the project is to try to discover the processes by which this efficiency is attained, which could be of great value in the design of automatic systems of face recognition.
A simple model of human face recognition based on work by the grant holders and other British groups is being employed as a framework within which to design and interpret experiments.
From an initial sample of 1000 male faces, two groups are selected, one group comprising faces which people find easy to remember; the other of faces they find difficult to remember.
A variety of judgements, as well as measurements are taken on these faces to identify what distinguishes memorable from less memorable faces.
Experiments are carried out using these two groups of faces to examine the states by which particular faces become familiar to an observer.
In particular, the speed with which a man's face is recognised is related to the degree to which information about his appearance, personality and biographical details is available to the observer.
So far, very little information about this process has been published.
Further studies investigate what occurs when a person is faced with a number of faces simultaneously from which one or more may be recognised.
This is a problem so far not addressed by theories of face recognition.

During the early stages of mastery over language, children interpret and act upon verbal messages despite their ignorance of the meaning of many of the units and structures of the language used.
The use of strategies to interpret problematic utterances appears to be incompatible with coming to understand that a verbal message may not provide adequate information about the speaker's intended meaning.
This project examines some of the circumstances in which young children are prepared to abandon the implicit working assumption that the speaker's intended meaning can be identified on the basis of the verbal message given.
In particular, the project investigates the importance of children's increasing awareness that they do or do not know the precise reference of particular words.

The aim of the research is to identify ways in which general practitioners can encourage patients to check their understanding of instructions and advice offered during the consultation, and to produce relevant questions and comments.
The expectation is that by increasing patient participation in this way the project will achieve a reduction in patients' forgetting and misunderstanding of instructions and advice, and a reduction in the number of questions which occur to patients after their consultation.
Most of the studies will involve volunteer trainee GPs who will try out a variety of mutually agreed upon strategies designed to increase the frequency of signs indicating that patients are making active checks on their understanding and acceptance of suggestions made by the doctor.
Patients will be interviewed after their consultation in order to find out whether they can give an accurate account of what their doctor intended them to do, and whether they have queries which they failed to raise during their consultation.

The concept of ‘emotion’ is ill-defined within psychology, although paradoxically the lay person seems to know exactly what the term refers to.
This research is concerned with commonsense ideas about emotion and with the way people act upon information about their emotional state.
Previous investigations have demonstrated how provision of emotionally relevant information can influence the way people interpret their own behaviour and in turn whether they respond emotionally or non-emotionally to a given situation.
The present research is intended to determine which kinds of information are most effective in influencing this self-categorisation process, and relatedly which factors are central to the commonsense representation of what it means to be ‘emotional’.

Microcomputers are now commonplace in primary classrooms.
Generally, they have been welcomed: their potential for enriching the curriculum is widely acknowledged.
However, there is as yet little experience or research to guide either the design of software for early education or the management of its use within classrooms.
Any approach to these problems, particularly as they apply to very young children, must start from an understanding of the child's cognitive and social predispositions as a computer user.
In early development there are styles of thinking and of social interaction that could constrain the design and management of computer-based resources.
The present research will consider cognitive constraints that may arise from limitations in children's capacities for monitoring their own success at a task and thereby employ a strategic approach to its mastery.
This research will also consider how far young children's social behaviour with peers encourages collaborative working at computers and, then, how far an individual's self perception might be influenced by such focused collaborations.
Direct observations will be made of children using representative, but modified, classroom software.
The findings should be of interest to teachers, software designers and developmental psychologists.

There are many practical reasons for studying motor skill.
They often involve large investments of time spent in training and practice, and these processes can perhaps be simplified.
A person may develop bad habits that need correction.
A child or adult may need special training or retraining to overcome physical disability arising from developmental fault or injury, which may entail learning to use artificial limbs or other prosthetic aids.
Understanding the skill can also help in designing such aids.
The same knowledge can of course help design robots to replace the human in certain skilled but repetitive tasks.
The research will concentrate on three skills: piano playing, typing and handwriting/drawing.
There has already been extensive research on these, at Exeter and elsewhere, using computer techniques of control, recording and analysis.
There is intrinsic interest in these skills and they exemplify in different ways a family that includes speech production and certain industrial activities.
The further research here will continue to study highly skilled people but will give special attention to the problems of acquisition.
It will also construct computer simulations of skill to help solve the design problems.

In recent years, the scope of welfare and other services rendered to mentally handicapped people has changed and extended significantly.
There is a policy supported view that mentally handicapped people should not be placed in institutions; that community based alternatives should exist; and that small living arrangements are preferable to large.
However, neither the policy nor practice of the community placements of mentally handicapped people can develop intelligently without reference to the store of accumulated experience from local authority social services' department records; or the perspectives of the people who have been placed within unstaffed, community based housing.
The study aims to assemble some of the information recorded in social casework records with a view to constructing a prediction table of the factors relating to the successful placements of mentally handicapped adults in the community.
(This study follows a procedure developed by Parker (1966): Decision in Child Care: A Study of Prediction in Fostering (Allen & Unwin).
The study also aims to represent the views of those people who have made successful or unsuccessful placements.
The research is being carried out in the North West as this region is one of the largest providers of local authority unstaffed homes.

This study is concerned with the initial stages of children's language acquisition, when they are speaking by using only one word at a time.
One aim is to describe the meanings which children express through the use of their earliest words; a second aim is to investigate the sources of these meanings.
These aims will be achieved by video-recording children at play with their mothers, starting when the children are six months old and following the same children through until twenty-one months of age.
These video records will be used to identify the words which the children produce and the situations in which they produce them.
The records will also be used to identify the characteristics of the mother's usage of these same words.
The relations between the child's and the mother's patterns of word usage will be examined.
This research brings together two lines of enquiry into early child language which have previously been studied separately: the way in which mothers talk to their children, and the early development of children's vocabularies.

The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a theory of how people perceive shapes and real-world objects.
Such research is necessary for understanding the mental processes involved in object recognition; how object recognition may develop; and, how such recognition breaks down in certain cases of brain damage.
Although experimental psychology has been successful in providing detailed accounts of how people recognise words, comparatively little is known about how people recognise real-world objects.
As this is the case, part of the research will examine various experimental techniques used previously in studies on word recognition.
For example, the time taken to name a picture of an object can provide useful information especially when this time can be manipulated by a prior event.
Typically, the time to name is speeded up when the picture is preceded by itself, or if it is preceded by a picture of a related object.
The project will examine picture naming times under conditions which vary the relations between consecutive pictures (changing size, orientation etc).
It is by studying the pattern of naming times across such different situations that we can understand where changes in size and orientation affect recognition.
Such work will help develop a detailed account of object recognition and allow predictions to be made to related fields (eg the development of recognition processes and their neurological breakdown).

A good deal is known about how to teach children to recognise words and, typically, it is this skill that is measured in classroom reading tests.
However, successful reading development also requires the child to become efficient at comprehending text.
Initial research has identified a distinct group of poor child readers: those that perform normally on word recognition tests but show inferior text comprehension.
This research aims to explore the nature of this impairment and examine ways in which it might be overcome.
The first phase of the research examines the extent to which differences in memory and inferential skills contribute to comprehension difficulties.
The experiments involve the use of a computer based system to display text to children and measure their reading time for different types of material.
By the use of this technique, it will be possible to gain precise information about the nature of reading difficulties at the time of comprehension rather than relying on inferences made from memory performance.
Later experiments will evaluate the extent to which problems in comprehension are related to specific age groups, or types of materials.
A final series of studies will be concerned with the ways in which comprehension can be improved.

Individuals in many settings are now as a matter of routine involved in interactions with complex computer systems.
In particular, the development of expert systems for use in medical, legal, commercial or educational contexts has meant that many person-computer exchanges take on a conversational quality.
Very little is known about the way such dialogues are sustained.
One working assumption might be that the rules governing conversation between persons can be extended in a natural way to cover the new situation, but there are grounds for doubting that this is what literally occurs.
Conversation between persons depends in large measure on presuppositions each participant has of the other's mental state and it is unlikely that the same presuppositions will influence conversation with a computer system.
The aim of the research is to examine the way a user's beliefs and knowledge about a particular computer system influence the form and content of the interaction which takes place.

The aim of this research is to use the methods of psychology and artificial intelligence to study various types of human memory used in language understanding.
While there has been much research on the short term memory system of the type used to, eg, remember telephone numbers, relatively little is known about the nature of temporary memory for information which is held in the focus of attention during reading and conversation (‘foregrounded' information).
The research will draw on and integrate current work in artificial intelligence, linguistics, and cognitive psychology.
Models of human temporary memory will be constructed using computer simulation techniques, and these models will be tested in a number of psychological experiments.
The main purpose of the research is to produce a comprehensive psychological account of human temporary memory which can be interfaced with recent linguistic and artificial intelligence accounts of aspects of language comprehension.
A further important aim of the research is to use the new model to explain difficulties that children have in using language.
The result of the investigation will also be relevant to the design of artificially intelligent systems for communication in both written and spoken language.

People understand language by using their knowledge about everyday life to add to what is explicitly stated.
To understand even the simplest text, we need many different kinds of knowledge.
Consider: ‘George went to a Curry House.
The food was excellent and he left a large tip.’
We can infer that George was in a restaurant, and that he sat at a table and looked at a menu.
The waiter probably took his order and brought him his food.
People make use of such knowledge about what typically happens in order to ‘read between the lines’.
The aim of the project is twofold:—
(1)
to investigate what knowledge people use and how they use it when they read texts;
(2)
to develop a computer program that will manipulate ‘knowledge’ in the same way as humans do in understanding language.
A number of controlled reading experiments have already been carried out and a Knowledge Access Network (KAN) model is under development.
KAN is based on techniques developed for parallel computation and represents a meeting point for psychology and artificial intelligence (AI).
The benefits are that the experimentation has strong theoretical motivation and the AI program is designed to imitate humans.

A common application of modern information technology is to provide an ‘expert system’ for people who are faced by difficult choices; such as diagnosing a disease, or finding the cheapest mode of transport to a given destination.
The computer can give questions for the user to ask, and also draw inference from the answers.
Little is known however about the sequence in which unaided people will ask questions in such a situation, whether they change their tactics if dealing with problems of different kinds, whether there are systematic differences between people, and so on.
Still less does one know whether people tend to resist suggestions from a machine that go against their unaided habits, or whether they rapidly and thankfully accept that some things are better done by a computer.
This research carries out laboratory measurements of the way members of the general public solve problems of this kind, to find out what happens without a computer; it also looks at what happens when people are given a simple expert system to use, and what problems profit from, or are hindered by, the aid from the machine.
The system was written by one of the investigators and is already employed in a project being undertaken in the department for the Alvey Directorate.
While the Alvey project will shed light on difficulties being experienced with systems now in service, this ESRC project is intended to provide background long-range knowledge that will make future expert systems easier for people to use.

Computer systems, social systems and the human mind are similar in many important respects, some of which have already been exploited in the design of new information technology.
However, one major difference has been that the mind of an individual develops with time and becomes better at the tasks it undertakes, whereas computers, with certain limited exceptions, perform at the same level of ability until replaced by a better machine or a better program.
This project aims to study the specialised procedures which enable human systems to improve their performance over time, with a view to suggesting design principles for self-developing programs, and also perhaps for incorporation in educational curricula, social organisations, and so on.
The underlying theory suggests that action and decision are controlled in the mind by a multi-level process, each level of which regulates and modifies the one below.
The highest of these levels produce the long-term stability and progressive improvements in efficiency of the specific decision units lower in the system.
The problem is to discover the procedures by which high-level units bring this about.
In four related experimental studies, a model decision making system of this kind, consisting of several people, each taking the part of one functional sub-system, will be modified to see which operating principles produce the fastest improvement in decision making tasks.

The Unit is jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Medical Research Council to address applied psychological questions concerning people and jobs.
It brings together occupational, social, clinical and cognitive psychologists.
Particular emphasis is placed upon longitudinal investigations of changes at the work-place or of the development of personal strategies to cope with stress in jobs or during unemployment.
Principal growth in the Unit's programme in the past year has been in the area of new technology in manufacturing and medical settings.
During this period, research funds have also been received from the Department of Employment, the Department of Health and Social Security, the Department of Trade and Industry, the European Economic Community, and several industrial companies.
Psychological and organizational aspects of new technology in manufacturing industry
Investigators: C W Clegg, J M Corbett, R P A Martin, S Ravden, Dr T D Wall
This project examines the introduction, operation and management of new technology in manufacturing enterprises, and its impact on employees and the organisation.
The focus is on computerised numerical control, and flexible manufacturing systems, and their consequences for job content, reporting and control procedures, productivity, and the relationship between production and support services.
Technologically-induced change in these areas is being examined for its impact on employee well-being and performance.
Information technology in health and welfare services
Investigators: G Brownbridge, Dr M J Fitter, J R Garber, G Herzmark, D Robinson, Dr T D Wall
This research is concerned with the impact of computer-based information systems on organisation, service providers, and their clients.
One current study is concerned with the impact of general practice computer systems on doctors, receptionists and patients.
Such systems provide administrative assistance, dealing for example with age-sex registers, patient recall and repeat prescriptions.
The research involves monitoring the effects of implementing these administrative support functions in over 140 practices nationwide.
Also of interest is computer use during consultations, where patient notes are made available and up-dated using a desk-top terminal.
The aim here is to determine the effect of such interactive facilities on the doctor-patient relationship, patient attitudes, and the delivery of care.
Cognitive ergonomics
Investigators: Dr P Briggs, Dr G R J Hockey, G I Johnson
A new project is focusing on cognitive problems associated with operating computer-based systems at work.
One investigation is concerned with the effectiveness of training in word-processing skills; the aim is to assess the relative contribution of instruction and practical experience in the development of the user's mental model of the system.
Work role transitions, career development and innovation at work
Investigators: A Brooks, Dr N Nicholson, A Rees, Dr M A West
The effects of job change and mobility on individuals and organisations have been investigated through cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of 200 graduate entrants to university, 120 police inspectors, and 2,300 middle to senior managers.
Two new projects are enlarging upon our interest in innovation.
The first is a comparative study of wool textile organisations, investigating the relationship between career development, innovation and company performance.
The second is a study of hospital Accident and Emergency Units, looking at social psychological factors influencing performance and innovation amongst Senior House Officers on short term attachment to Units.
Occupational strain
Investigators: J Firth, Dr K Janman, J G Jones, Dr R L Payne
This project is examining psychological and physiological indicators of strain during periods of work.
Amount and type of strain are being studied in a range of settings, selected to differ in terms of job demands, discretion and support.
Attention is being directed to cumulative strain lasting for months or years as well as to the nature and effects of short periods of acute strain.
Individual differences in strain responses are of particular interest, and these are being examined in research with samples of doctors and nurses.
Psychotherapy and job-related problems
Investigators: Dr M J Barkham, J Firth, G Hardy, L A Morrison, Dr D A Shapiro
Two main fields of psychotherapy (behavioural/cognitive and relationship-oriented) have been compared in a project with managerial and professional workers experiencing clinical levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms and occupational strain.
Both treatments had a significant impact on problems, with results slightly favouring behavioural/cognitive methods.
The project is now seeking to identify the most helpful elements within each type of therapy, and studying differences between individuals in their responses to each.
A new study is replicating and extending the earlier work with a larger group of white-collar workers.
Psychological aspects of unemployment
Investigators: Dr P R Jackson, Dr R L Payne, Professor P B Warr
Interview studies with several thousand unemployed people have mapped out decrements in psychological health caused by unemployment.
It is consistently found that the impact of being without a job varies between groups of people, and research attention is particularly directed to the identification of variables which might moderate this impact: for example, age, socio-economic status, sex, length of unemployment, personal employment commitment, and psychological vulnerability.
Studies are also investigating changes in the nature of social networks and in family relationships during continuing unemployment.
Longitudinal study of unemployed young people
Investigators: Dr M H Banks, E J Jackson
A longitudinal study of over 1,100 young people has been extended to cover the first four years in the labour market, from ages 16 to 20 years.
Half the sample is male and half female; West Indians as well as whites have been interviewed.
Psychological health, commitment to the labour market, social networks, perceived job discrimination, and other features are being examined as a function of duration of unemployment, sex, and ethnic group.

Recent and current work demonstrates incontrovertibly that if a child is adept at segmenting heard speech into sub-word constituents before tackling the task of learning to read, this task will be accomplished much more easily.
The present research investigates how being good at phonological segmentation helps a child to learn to read.
Current models of reading development assert that the child's phonological knowledge and skills are only brought into play after an initial visual stage, and are involved in conscious decoding from print to sound.
The present research questions this narrow role for phonology, and investigates the hypotheses that phonologically aware children with a developing knowledge of sound-letter correspondence learn to read easily because they can create a primitive word recognition system to recognise printed monosyllabic words in terms of the partial information carried by their beginning and end letters.
Linguistic variables related to the development of phonological awareness and to the ease with which sound-letter correspondences are learned are investigated.
Data collection will also continue from the group of 26 children whose reading development has been observed from pre-school (4+ years) to top infants (7+).

An English word is composed from one or more elements called morphemes.
The morpheme is the smallest unit of language that expresses meaning and is governed by the grammatical rules of the language.
These linguistic statements about the formal structure of language leave open such psychological questions as
(i)
how people learn about these constituents of words and the rules governing their combination, and
(ii)
the manner and extent to which morphological considerations influence the process of word recognition.
This project addresses the second question in relation to the recognition of written words.
The method of investigation involves timing the mental processes that underlie recognition, for example by measuring the speed with which a reader can decide whether a string of letters forms a familiar word.
It is already established that performance in such tasks is influenced by morphemic factors.
English has the convenient property that some words have obvious morphemic constituents (WALK-ED), while others are irregularly composed (HUNG), and still others have illusory constituents (SCAR-CITY).
The main direction taken by the experimental work is to examine the reader's mental representations of English inflectional formations, as they affect visual recognition processes.
Frequency effects for irregularly inflected forms are also studied.

Rational thought and behaviour are generally thought to be dependent in some ways upon an ability to reason logically.
This raises questions about how such an ability develops, about whether young children (and certain groups of adults) have the ability, about the age at which it normally develops, and about the effects of culture and education upon that development.
Various psychological tests have been devised for the purpose of diagnosing the presence or absence of logical ability but agreement on the relevant criteria has been difficult to reach.
In such cases of disagreement between professionally and theoretically interested parties, it sometimes proves a useful corrective to step back from the problem and to enquire into ‘folk’ conceptions regarding the relevant issues.
This procedure can highlight both differences between lay thinking and professional thinking, and also cultural differences in the way the issues are conceived.
This research investigates folk conceptions of logical ability and contrasts these with the positions adopted by psychologists, anthropologists, and others.
The aim is to achieve a sharper understanding of what is involved in logical ability.
The principal method of investigation will be survey by interview and questionnaire.

Human memory has been studied extensively by psychologists interested in how knowledge is stored, organised and used.
Much of the work has concentrated on verbal memory (for words or passages of text) and spatial memory (for diagrams or pictures).
Comparatively little is known about memory for complex movements.
The research aims to bring to provide answers to the question ‘How do we imitate what we see someone else do?’
In practical terms imitation is important both in teaching movements to others, and in assessing the motor abilities of brain damaged patients who cannot respond to verbal instructions, but who can imitate movements.
The issues considered by the research are relevant to practical questions but are chiefly theoretical, dealing with the relative use of verbal, spatial and motor representations of movement in both working memory and long term memory.
The research involves experimental studies of memory for sequences of movement, body centred encoding of movement, and memory for movements which can be named.
In addition, it is concerned with the abilities of expert movers, such as dancers, who spend large amounts of time watching and repeating the movements of others.
Expert/novice differences provide insight into memory coding and processing

Faces, words and objects form three classes of stimuli that most people are able to identify with ease.
People who have suffered cerebral injuries (such as strokes), however, may lose the ability to recognise stimuli from any one of these classes whilst remaining able to recognise stimuli from the other two classes.
The project will use techniques of experimental psychology to investigate the processes involved in face, word and object recognition, and to make comparisons between them.
The work will be carried out entirely with normal subjects, but it is intended to help in understanding why patients with cerebral injuries can show disorders of word recognition whilst object and face recognition remain apparently intact, disorders of object recognition whilst word and face recognition remain apparently intact, or disorders offace recognition whilst object and word recognition remain apparently intact.
This will further our knowledge of how people recognise everyday stimuli, and may be of importance to the rehabilitation of stroke patients.

The natural world is full of variety and change.
Traditionally, psychologists have said that we cope with this by organising experienced stimuli into a limited number of categories or concepts.
But we still aren't clear about how these concepts are formed.
Most theories agree that a concept is based on objects or events that have features in common.
But they tend to diverge into two types with respect to the information about features that is thought to be important.
One type suggests that it is simply the frequencies with which the separate features occur; a ‘prototype’ is often said to be formed from the most commonly occurring features (thus we form mental prototypes of dog, tree, car, and so on).
The other type suggests that it is the relations between features that is most important--eg the extent to which one feature (such as car body size) can predict others (such as engine size).
Although these types of theory are mutually incompatible, both regularly obtain empirical support in experiments by different researchers.
The present research introduces and tests a new model of concept formation which,
(a)
adopts new methods for quantifying and analysing the relational (or ‘contingent’) information in a set of stimuli; and
(b)
shows how the extent and pattern of this information can produce different concept structures which readily correspond with the two types mentioned above.
Thus, by describing the conditions under which different concept structures are obtained, the research may resolve a difficult problem in current theorising, and help develop a more comprehensive and unified theory in the future.

This project takes as its starting point the fundamental tendency of people to seek explanations for events.
Explanations serve to give meaning to events, to enable us to apportion praise or blame and to predict the behaviour of other people and of other events in our environment.
Explaining an event in different ways may be related to failures of communication between people and groups.
Classifying an event is a necessary first step to understanding it, and in many cases may be entirely adequate as an explanation.
For instance, classifying an event as a ‘riot’ or as ‘vandalism’may call forth different typical explanations for the event, and differences may be expected in the typical people involved in such activity, the typical consequences and the relevant steps necessary to prevent such behaviour.
These knowledge structures about events are labelled ‘event prototypes’.
The research will involve understanding events in the three areas of stealing, illness and aggression.
The first stage consists of finding out about different instances within each of these categories and their interrelationships.
The second stage is concerned with the content of prototypes.
The questions concern what sorts of people are perceived as being typically involved in these events, why, the consequences, and so forth.
The third stage is particularly concerned with how systematic variation in the characteristics of events affects the way in which they are categorised.

The high cost and slow pace of computer program development remains the major obstacle to the widespread provision of educational software.
‘Authoring Systems'--computer systems which allow a non-programmer ‘author’ to create a program automatically--have been widely used for industrial training software and offer unrivalled productivity.
Unfortunately such systems have proved too hard to use for non-experts and too inflexible to support learning rather than training.
The investigator's ‘Intelligent’ Authoring System (IAS) harnesses expert systems techniques to offer much more flexible interaction with the author together with the potential for an unlimited range of program designs.
Through use of a large corpus of pre-specified program design knowledge in the form of a ‘script’ for each common design, the IAS can interact with a teacher-author in a relatively natural manner--prompting the teacher for the most important information first, and then automatically filling in subsequent details as necessary.
Following this congenial ‘knowledge elicitation’ phase, the IAS creates automatically and immediately a working protype program.
This feasibility study will enhance our current system to create a prototype IAS written in PROLOG which will run on a RM Nimbus micro and produce working ‘science simulation’ programs in BBC Basic.

The aim of this research is to investigate in detail how babies are able to comprehend the gestures of looking and manual pointing in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of communication that precede the acquisition of language.
Recent research has shown that babies as young as 6 months comprehend changes in the direction of gaze of an adult as a signal.
The infant will turn to see what the adult is looking at, as if the adult's behaviour draws the baby's attention to a potentially interesting event.
However, before approximately 10 months, babies do not understand the significance of an adult's manual pointing.
When the adult points at an interesting object, the young baby looks at the adult's hand.
From approximately 10 months the baby progressively overcomes this error and will successfully locate the target.
This new ability to comprehend the manual point seems to coincide with a change in cognitive ability whereby the baby identifies the location of the target by extrapolating a straight line from the adult to the designated object.
It is as if the baby can now calculate geometrically the precise location of the target from the angle of the adult's head and arm relative to self and the environment.
A series of studies has been designed in this research project to determine how accurately babies can perform the ‘geometric’ calculation involved.
The research will investigate how the mechanisms of pre-verbal communication based on comprehension and production of gaze and pointing are related to each other and how they change between 6 and 18 months of age.
This will extend our knowledge of how the species--typical communicative gestures that precede the onset of language are acquired and may have application to a wide range of practical problems concerned with normal and abnormal processes of language acquisition.

Subjective examination of advertisements for alcoholic drinks suggests that certain images such as attractiveness, sociability and toughness predominate.
Empirical research indicates that young people perceive non-drinkers lacking in these qualities.
Nevertheless, there is no empirical evidence that such advertisements employ images which are attractive to the young.
Furthermore, even if one accepts the validity of non-empirical interpretations, it is not known at what age young people would perceive the advertisements in similar terms.
Recent research by the Advertising Research Unit indicates that an adult-like perception of the imagery in cigarette advertisements develops over the years 10 to 14; certainly it is well established by 16 years.
This research will be extended by examining 10- to 16-year olds' perceptions of advertisements for alcoholic drinks.
In this, both qualitative (group discussions) and quantitative (social survey) research procedures will be used.
Such research may have important practical implications.
A sound knowledge of children's perceptions of advertisements for cigarettes and alcoholic drinks is an essential prerequisite for the design of effective health education programmes to make children more aware of motivational pressures acting on them.
Effective communication demands an understanding of the child's point of view.

What are the likely effects on the Police Service of the extended Fixed Penalty system, introduced on 1 October 1986 under Part III of the Transport Act 1982, whereby on-the-spot fines of 12 or 24 pounds may be levied by police officers for road traffic offences?
In particular, what effect will it have on patrolling officers' discretionary decisions (whether to prosecute or verbally advise an offending motorist), what consequences may there be for the management and monitoring of these discretionary enforcement practices by supervisory officers, and what implications are there for Force training
(a)
in connection with the new legislation, and
(b)
in connection with the development of skill at discretionary decision making?
To this end the investigator shall circulate a questionnaire to about 150 traffic officers and inspectors in a major provincial Police Force to look at: views on the impact of Fixed Penalty Notices on police/public relations; officers' workload; officers' exercise of discretion; supervisors' mechanisms for monitoring discretion; views on the proper extent, limitation, acquisition and training of discretion; and attributes of the offence and the offender which influence officers' decisions.
In addition, the investigator will test around 500 officers on a specially devised psychological instrument to determine the influence towards or away from prosecuting of a range of factors which may apply when an officer deals with a ‘typical’ traffic offence such as stopping a motorist for exceeding a speed limit.
It is hoped that this will give the investigator some purchase on normal discretionary practices as a background against which to view the effects of the new legislation.

The Sheffield project will take place in a city with a declining manufacturing base, some moderate growth in the service sector and with similarities to many Northern cities.
It has ‘about average’ socio-economic characteristics compared with other LEAs in the country, but there are stark contrasts between areas of the city.
In recent years it has begun to experience high levels of adult and youth unemployment.
Substantial proportions of 16 year-olds join the Youth Training Scheme; about half of those leaving schemes obtain employment.
About 800 of the city's 15/16 year-olds and 800 17/18 year-olds (a 1 in 10 sample) will complete questionnaires in 1987.
Among the factors to be looked at will be their early careers, family background, educational achievement, attitudes to education, training, employment, unemployment, economic policies and political issues.
Each sample will be recontacted after a year and after two years to assess the degree of change amongst the young people.
In addition sub-samples will be selected for in-depth study by interview and several ethnographic studies will be carried out in the different settings of work-place, school, college and community.

The purpose of this project is to show how young men and women think and feel about their education, their job and training prospects, their role in local and national politics, and their domestic and familial responsibilities.
The project will try to go further than a mere description of attitudes or beliefs: the object is to explain their origins in previous experiences and to predict their implications for future action.
Swindon is a particularly interesting area in which to explore these issues.
It is strategically placed between London and Bristol in the M4 Corridor and has benefited from the massive growth of the micro-electronic industry.
While some forms of employment in the area have declined (for example, in the railway workshops), they have been more than compensated for by the high technology boom and its associated distribution and service industries.
Given the nature of employment prospects in Swindon, one of the central questions to be asked in our study concerns attitudes towards work with new technology.
The project will try to explain varying levels of motivation to work in new technology industries.
The investigators will tie this to educational and family background.
The investigators also want to show whether attempts to ‘switch’ young people on to new technology are working.
The real question is what influences actually produce people who make good and willing technologists at both the professional and skilled levels.
The project will also be exploring how identity, the self-concept, changes in response to educational and occupational experiences during adolescence.
It is known from other work that economic and political attitudes and actions are channelled by the individual's requirement for personal esteem and social approval.
This project should enable us to say how far the characteristics of the individual (their feelings of originality, efficacy, conformity, alienation, anxieties, and so on) account for their political and economic values and activities and how both relate to social position.

The project will examine the way 11-16 year olds respond to scientific and technological change.
The major part of the research will involve a survey of children at school in six geographical areas.
These areas have been selected to tie into other current ESRC Initiatives on Social Change and Economic Life and on the economic and political understanding in 16-19 year olds.
Information will be collected upon the psychological and social characteristics of respondents; their understanding of science and technology (with special reference to changes), their attitudes to both; and their personal and social activities relating to science and technology.
The immediate object of the research is to generate a model of the relation of understanding, attitudes and action regarding science and technology.

A number of properties of text are known to influence the way in which the reader's eyes move.
For example, the physical length of words lying to the right of the reader's current fixation, plays an important role in determining where the next fixation will fall.
In addition, the grammatical function and meaning of words affects both the location and duration of fixations.
These effects relate to the first encounter with words in a text.
The present project, in contrast, concentrates on influences over subsequent reinspections of what has been read.
These ‘second-pass’ eye movements relate to attempts to organise the meaning of what is read and to correct faulty syntactic decisions.
Thus, their measurement is a valuable ‘on-line’ index of a reader's attempts to derive a coherent representation of meaning.
A guiding hypothesis in the work to be carried out is that fluent readers have access to information regarding the location of at least some previously read words.
This spatial code is used to direct accurate and selective regressive eye movements.
It appears that poor readers make less use of this mode of selective reanalysis and the work aims to discover whether this is because the use of a spatial code is peculiarly characteristic of very fluent readers.
The work will examine groups of children and adults differing in reading skill.

It is well known that deprived children tend to do less well at school than their ‘ordinary’ peers.
But by no means do all ordinary children do well, nor all deprived children poorly.
This study focuses on a group of deprived children and the different levels of development and attainment to be found within such a group.
The aim is to discover which factors are important for promoting the development of such children and also those responsible for impeding good development.
From an earlier study carried out in 1977-80 and supported by the SSRC, the investigators suspect two important factors are:
(i)
involvement in joint activity with adults and
(ii)
stress, arising from difficulties with such things as health, work, money, housing and family.
The first objective of the present study therefore, is to assess the relative levels and importance of activity and stress in the lives of deprived nine-year olds.
To this end, interview and assessment data will be gathered from each of the children, their parents and teachers.
Secondly, the prospective information available from the earlier work will be used to compare the importance of activity and stress during the earlier and later years of childhood.
This is an issue which has important implications for both policy and practice in the areas of education and social welfare.

Computer programming in schools has until recently been largely limited to the use of ‘imperative’ languages such as BASIC.
Although it is possible to use such languages as problem-solving ‘tools’, they suffer from the limitation that considerable expertise is needed to use them freely and effectively.
MicroPROLOG is one of a family of new ‘descriptive’ programming languages which are very different in character.
MicroPROLOG lends itself particularly well to the construction of databases which can then be interrogated in a number of different ways.
This approach holds the promise of making the computer a valuable resource in teaching throughout the curriculum.
One of the aims of the present study is to examine the learning processes involved, and some of the conceptual difficulties which arise, when twelve and thirteen year old children begin using microPROLOG.
The impact of using microPROLOG on the children's thinking and problem solving in other domains is also being examined.
A specific focus of the research is to study how children work together in groups with the computer.
Collaborative problem solving has previously been shown to be an effective stimulus to individual learning in certain circumstances, using somewhat ‘artificial’ tasks.
This study should allow a reliable assessment to be made of the importance of this factor in the context of classroom computing.

How do adolescents cope with the experience of leaving school?
This study focuses upon a number of children over a period of up to 40 months beginning early in their final year at school and covering the transitional period that follows.
The adolescents will be interviewed about their experience and difficulties.
It is planned that the less literate and less articulate will be given the chance to contribute and one of the main aims of the project will be to provide information on the position of poorly-qualified 15-19 year olds today.
Longitudinal studies of this kind have been very limited, and the study should provide an excellent basis for the critical examination of self-identity theory.

As computing costs fall and equipment becomes easier to use, the application and influence of computers is likely to increase.
Evidence suggests a significant growth has occurred in the use of computers for a variety of planning purposes.
There has, however, been little research on the use of computers in planning practice.
The research aims to develop the work and findings of an earlier project (Bardon and Stothers 1982) by:
(1)
Extending and deepening the investigation of computer applications in UK local authority planning departments, considering the nature and distribution of computer use, the type and range of software used, areas of application, current problems and potential use; and
(2)
Identifying and examining a cross-section of planning departments to pursue in-depth studies concerning the selection, introduction and operation of computer systems.
A postal survey is being conducted to provide a comprehensive national profile of computer use in local authority planning departments.
The detailed investigation of selected planning departments involves interviews with key personnel.
Ultimately, the research project therefore aims to evaluate the role and effectiveness of computers in planning and to provide some guidelines regarding the selection, introduction and operation of computer systems.

The perfect way to learn a foreign language is to spend some time with the native speakers of that language.
However, this is too costly and sometimes unpractical for many people.
Many approaches to second language teaching have been tried so far, each with differing degrees of success.
The most recent approaches have been language laboratories and computer-based instruction.
These approaches have fallen well short of the perfect situation: the teaching medium (audio tapes, computer programs) did not ‘know’ the language they were teaching.
However, the new discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) attempts to build computer systems with the knowledge of a particular area.
What makes these system knowledge-based is not that it somehow takes knowledge to write them, nor that they behave as if they had knowledge, but rather that their architectures include explicit knowledge bases.
The ESRC has given Mr Masoud Yazdani of Exeter University a grant to produce a set if AI tools which will be easy enough for teachers of modern languages to construct their own language teaching aids without needing a great deal of expertise in computer programming.

To investigate the following: 1 The effect of the attitude of the headteacher on the uptake of microcomputers.
2 Teachers' perceptions of the value of microcomputers in the primary curriculum.
3 How the educational value of microcomputer use, as perceived by the teachers, affects their classroom practice.
4 How the LEA's perception of teachers' training needs is reflected in INSET provision.
5 The difference between teachers' perceived and actual training needs.
6 The adequacy of INSET provision in training teachers to use microcomputers most effectively in the classroom.
7 The critical factors which influence the uptake and development of microcomputer use at an LEA level, at a school level and at a teacher level.
The methods used to achieve these aims involved both analysing data collected in the earlier projects (1985-87), and investigations during the current project (1988).
(1)
Continued analysis of:
(a)
classroom observations (1985-87),
(b)
initial and subsequent headteachers and teacher interviews (1985- 87)
(c)
observations of INSET and interviews of INSET tutors and course teachers (1986).
(2)
In 1988, return visits to 4 schools studied in 1987 involving
(a)
headteacher interviews
(b)
class teacher interviews, using a modified interview schedule developed during the second project (1986).
The classroom observations (see 1a) were written up in the form of case studies, to include descriptive accounts of the pupil's microcomputer use, teachers' class organisation and intervention occurrences.
The schoolteacher interview data (1a,2a,2b) was analysed by comparing initial and subsequent interviews.
This data also contributed to the school profiles.
An exhaustive set of categories was developed from the INSET observational data to inform the project about the balance between technical, operational, educational and other INSET practices.
The INSET teacher interview data was used to inform this analysis.
School profiles were written using data from 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b.

Driver and pedestrian accidents are least frequent in mid life, but then become more common as age advances.
Likely contributing factors are that people fail to recognise, and to compensate for insidious deterioration of vision, hearing and decision speed as they age.
They also may not recognise that their accuracy of judgement of distance and velocity, and competence in coping with complex traffic situations has charged.
Six thousand volunteers aged from 50 to 80 years, and 9000 respondents from the University of the Third Age will complete questionnaires probing their confidence in coping with a variety of traffic hazards, and their estimates of their sensory competence.
Rank orderings of difficulties and hazards with advancing age will be compared with estimates given by skilled driving instructors.
All six thousand volunteers will be visually and audiometrically screened to compare actual against subjectively perceived sensory loss.
Field experiments and computer interaction learning experiments will calibrate actual loss accuracy of temporal and spatial judgements, and of decision speed complex scenarios, for comparison against subjectively perceived changes.
One practical outcome will be range of self administered tests which allow older people to better, monitor their efficiency and recognise and adapt to change.

Computers are notoriously bad at understanding language.
Even the best computer programs are unable to understand a sentence containing a pronoun such as he or she.
But we do not yet fully understand how people comprehend such sentences.
So it is not surprising that we cannot get computers to understand them.
The research investigates how adult readers understand pronouns.
It will show how linguistic knowledge and general knowledge are combined when a person understands a pronoun.
It will also show this combination when a person reads a single sentence and when a person reads a long passage of prose.
In addition, the research provides a detailed account of the mental processes that are used as the reader understands each new word in a sentence.
The principal method of investigation is to show people sentences one at a time on a computer screen and measure the time it takes to understand a sentence.
The time taken is a measure of the difficulty of the sentence.
Readers will also be stopped at different points in the sentence and asked to identify words seen earlier.
The time taken to identify words is a measure of how well that particular word has been understood.

Significant changes are taking place in the regulatory environment within which firms operate.
In the UK, Japan and the US there have been a spate of deregulatory initiatives taken by government, and European governments are also moving more slowly in the same direction.
Amongst the industries most affected by deregulation have been those involved in innovatory technological activity.
Notable amongst these have been companies involved in defence contracting, transport and telecommunications.
This project seeks to explore the impact of deregulation upon such industries and to assess the role of new industry agreements and supra-national regulatory mechanisms upon company strategies.
An important element of the project will focus upon the development of international standards in such fields as software, computing and telecommunications.
The information thus generated will enable the development of new perspectives upon the global, national and regional dimensions of inter-firm agreements, inward investment and innovation potential.

Methods for analysing qualitative data — transcripts of interviews, verbal protocols, ethnographic field notes and the like — have until recently had to rely on little more than scissors, a copier and piles of paper.
In the past few years, however, there has been progress in the systematic analysis of qualitative data using a variety of specially written computer programs.
The time is ripe for a review of progress to date and an assessment of the likely future impact of computers on the craft of qualitative analysis.
The grantholder, along with Dr R Lee of St Mary's College, is convening a symposium to consider these matters at the University of Surrey in July 1989. the meeting will address: i.
Established and emergent efforts to achieve a generic theory of qualitative analysis and the role of such theories in specifying requirements for programmes to assist in qualitative analysis.
ii.
The teaching of computer-based techniques in qualitative research in advanced research methods training iii.
Implications of computerbased techniques for the craft of qualitative research, in particular, to enable an assessment of the impact of these procedures on the formalisation and systematisation of qualitative analysis.

In spring 1991 the biennial Scottish Young People's Survey will contact a representative sample of young people in Scotland who completed their last compulsory school year in 1990.
The survey will collect information on young people's education, training, labour- market leisure and family experiences, and it will record their attitudes and aspirations.
The funding will contribute towards an increase in the sample fraction from its usual 10% to 50% giving a total (target) sample of about 35,000.
Enlarging the sample will allow for more reliable analyses at a school, neighbourhood or local level, or for groups of interest such as ethnic minorities or young people in particular occupations or courses of education.
The data will be used for research on a range of topics including the effectiveness of secondary schools, local authority differences, parental choice of schooling, the problems of rural sparsely populated areas, the school curriculum, the transition from school and entry into the labour market or further education, and the effect of policy initiatives such as the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, the Youth Training Scheme and Scottish National Certificate.
The survey will also supply intelligence and research to support local authorities and the new local enterprise companies (LECs, equivalent to TECs in England and Wales) which will be responsible for the local implementation of training policy.

Infants who live with their mothers in the 3 British prison Mother and Baby Units are the object of much recent public concern and controversy.
Criticism of the Units is frequently based on research from the 1930's and 40's, which demonstrated the severe impairment of psychological function and development in traditionally organized residential institutions.
However, recent research conducted in progressive and child-centred institutions found no overall or severe retardation.
Do the facilities and regimes in the prison Units have effects comparable to traditional or modern childcare institutions?
Observational and interview data or developmentally salient aspects of Unit life were collected as supplementary data during a study of the development of children in prison Mother and Baby Units.
The main study, which was commissioned by the Home Office, aimed to describe the developmental trajectories of Unit babies during their mothers' imprisonment.
This study will continue the analysis of data on aspects of Unit infants' experience that might explain the developmental strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in the main study.
It will also provide material for informed debate on prison nurseries and for the design of future nurseries in prisons and in comparable institutions, such as psychiatric units and probation hostels.

Following a three-year pilot Programme, the council of ESRC has awarded a little over 1 million for a programme in Information technology in Education, initially for three years, under its Human Behaviour and Development Research Group.
The information technology in Education Research programme has a Coordinating Centre at the University of Lancaster under Professor R Lewis.
The Centre has the following amongst its functions:— to carry continuing brief from ESRC in the formulation of a substantive research agenda;— to assist in securing tenders for research in fields which map onto the identified priority areas;— to ensure that researchers outside the ‘research centre’ institutions are aware of, and can contribute to, the overall programme and their research is supported through collaborative projects;— to ensure multidisciplinary coordination (seminars and personal contact) between the ‘centres’as appropriate;— to stimulate the integration of practitioners and policy makers in research as researchers through education authorities and industrial training bodies;
— to provide information, through appropriate media, to the whole community which will enhance opportunities for researchers and practitioner contributions to substantive research within the Programme and beyond;— to liaise and seek additional contributions in the formulation of the research/evaluation agenda and its execution from other bodies (DES, SED, TC, DTI, EEC, UNESCO, industry, training bodies, etc.);— to support UK participation in multi national conferences, programmes and projects organised by such agencies as the British Council and the EEC (ESPRIT, DELTA, AND COMETT);— to assist ESRC in its relations with SERC, DTI etc. in post- ALVEY, joint Research Council approaches to cognitive science and human computer interaction, and other joint governmental initiatives which require an IT and education contribution.
In addition to the Centre and a Policy Evaluation Unit based at the University of East Anglia, a tendering and peer review process conducted in the spring and early summer of 1988, resulted in the award of three major contracts of 250,000 each.
The research topics are:— Groupwork with Computers — Professor M Eraut (Sussex) and Professor C Hoyles (London Institute of Education);— Conceptual change in Science — Dr R Driver (Leeds), E Scanlon (OU) and others;— Tools for Exploratory Learning — London Mental Models Group.

The London Mental Models Group has been awarded the contract for their Tools for Exploratory Learning proposal within the ESRC Information Technology and Education Research Initiative.
The Group, established since Spring 1986, is multi-disciplinary, involving staff in science and mathematics education, in cognitive psychology, in educational computing, and in expert systems and artificial intelligence.
The group is also multi-institutional, drawing its members from King's College London, the London Institute of Education, Imperial College and Kingston Polytechnic.
What are ‘tools for exploratory learning’?
We mean software tools with which children can learn by exploring information, ideas and possibilities.
One example is a data-base, allowing one to explore data: another spreadsheet, allowing one to explore ‘what if?’ possibilities.
other examples include simulations, modelling systems adventure games and game generators.
We divide them into two main kinds, exploratory and expressive.
Exploratory tools, such as simulations or data-bases, themselves provide ideas or material to explore.
Expressive tools, by contrast, provide a ‘blank sheet’ on which the learner can project, and so explore, his or her own ideas.
They are ‘ideas-processors’ and include spreadsheets, modelling systems and adventure game generators.
We shall look at both kinds of tool, and at examples involving both qualitative and quantitative data or ideas.
The programme will select tools to be used in two main curriculum areas: Technology and the Humanities.
The work has two distinct main goals, one concerned with understanding the processes of learning with such tools, and the other with analysing and understanding the tools themselves.
The first goal seeks to understand mechanisms of learning using such tools.
Here we shall be concerned with the ways children use their own mental models to make sense of ideas and information, and with differences between the models children use and the models which are built-in to various tools.
This is where the two kinds of tool become important.
Exploratory tools allow learners to investigate views of a given domain which are different from theirs and so to examine consequences and conflicts.
Expressive tools give children opportunity to express on the computer their own ideas about reality, so that they can learn through representing, exploring and reflecting on the consequences of their own models.
These are, for us, different and complementary models of learning.
Our second goal is to understand the tools themselves better.
We want to be able to answer questions such as, ‘What makes a good tool for exploratory learning?’ and ‘How can a tool help children too manipulate it easily?’
There are also deeper questions: any tool, being a computer programme, has some kind of formalism built-in (LOGO for example includes procedures and lists).
What are important formal structures of this kind?
What kinds of subject matter is each good for?
We are interested in tools for the classroom in five years' time, rather than those which can be run now.
This means looking at expert and knowledge-based systems, amongst others.
The educational significance of the work is twofold.
If we value active and exploratory ways of learning we need to provide worthwhile, substantial, clear and well structured representations of ideas for children to explore.
If we acknowledge the importance of respecting the child's own ways of thinking, we need to find ways for that thinking to be expressed so that it can be reflected on, and to know how far doing this can also help learning.
And to do both we need to have a better and clearer idea of what an educational tool for learning looks like.
The 3 year programme will be co-directed by Joan Bliss (Kings's College) and Jon Ogborn (Institute of Education) who together with Jonathan Briggs (Kingston Polytechnic) and Derek Brough (Imperial College) constitute the programme's management group.
There will be one research officer in each of the four institutions.
The work of the programme will be developed in close collaboration with other members of the London Mental Model's Group, as an integral part of the work of the Group.

Considerable advances have been made in recent years in using computer models to understand the intellectual aspects of the human mind.
This project attempts to extend the use of such models to the analysis of motivational and emotional aspects.
The work starts with a very action-orientated point of view: the functional role of the mind is to support adaptive, intelligent action.
Both motivation and emotion will be analysed as processes concerned with the control of human action.
A theoretical framework will be developed, using computational concepts, which will be capable of giving an adequate account of the integration of cognitive, motivational and emotional aspects of mental phenomena.
The logical consistency and adequacy of the theory will then be tested by building computer simulation models of it.
The requirement of being implementable in the form of programs imposes a new and healthy constraint on theorising which has not been present previously.
The project is primarily concerned with human psychology, but it will have implications towards the building of intelligent artificial systems and the improvement of man-machine interaction in the use of present day computer systems.

This project is designed to implement one of the recommendations made by Hale, Green and Henry in the report Psychology Laboratory Computing commissioned by ESRC.
A modern systems programming language, Modula-2, is to be used to create an integrated environment for the development and running of laboratory control programs.
The aim is to construct a set of modules and utilities that provides user-oriented software tools for laboratory applications of computers.
The use of a high-level language promotes the portability of these tools to the new generation of 16-bit microprocessor-based machines.
The software will be of relevance in many laboratory applications outside psychology and there is a commitment to produce user-oriented documentation and tutorial material.

The competence of normal readers includes the ability to read aloud.
Such readers are able, when presented with a printed letter string, to apply certain mental operations to that string which result in the output of a spoken representation of the letter string.
The research is aimed at learning about the precise nature of these mental operations.
It is already known that the normal reader has at his or her disposal two very different procedures (two very different sets of mental operations) for accomplishing the conversion of print to speech.
These are now known as the lexical procedure and the non-lexical procedure.
The lexical procedure depends upon the reader having previously learned and stored information about the pronunciation of a letter string.
Here reading aloud is accomplished by retrieval of the information, which is thought of as being stored as an entry in an internal dictionary or ‘mental lexicon’.
Because we can read aloud entirely novel letter strings such as slint, however, there must be a second procedure by which reading aloud is achieved: a non-lexical procedure.
The nature of this procedure is currently disputed: at least four competing theories exist.
The research is designed to adjudicate between these conflicting theories.

The development of normal reading and writing is usually held to be multiply determined and to arise from the mastery of a number of subcomponent skills, such as detailed visual analysis, effective motor control, linguistic skills--ranging form sentence comprehension to phoneme discrimination.
If these skills are not present to some degree, then reading and writing will not be achieved.
However, a number of children have been identified who have no such component skills, even to the extent of giving no reliable IQ score at all.
Yet such children, named, for this reason, hyperlexic, can read and write.
The reading of hyperlexic children does not generally resemble that of normal children.
Essentially, such children do not appear to understand what they read or write: they perform the tasks in automatic ‘parrot’ fashion.
This project investigates these children's ability:
(a)
to distinguish written and spoken words and nonwords;
(b)
to discriminate correctly and incorrectly stressed words;
(c)
to be susceptible to effects of meaningfulness in their reading of single words (such as the Stroop colour word naming task).
Further investigations will be made into these childrens' inability to count the number of sounds in a word by tapping them out and their failure to perform rhyme judgements: both tasks which have been thought, hitherto, to be essential to adequate sound-letter mapping.
