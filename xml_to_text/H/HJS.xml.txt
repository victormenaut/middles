Splendid Isolation
Nycomed is your single source for a full range of separation media.
Whatever the cells or subcellular particles you're isolating, Nycomed products can be used to obtain very pure and clearcut suspensions.
Lymphoprep, for instance, is unrivalled for the isolation of human lymphocyte suspensions.
Whilst Lympho-paque is ideal for most mammalian lymphocytes.
The full range is completed by products such as Nycodenz, a universal centrifugation medium, Mycodenz Monocytes, Metrizamide, and Sodium Metrizoate.
Plus two new additions, Sucrose and Caesium Chloride, assayed to the highest quality.
All are available off-the-shelf, from a single supplier.
If you're looking for faster, purer isolation, you ought to be looking at the Nycomed range — as detailed in our brand new Separation Products literature.
