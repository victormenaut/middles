We will also insure you against an accident involving any trailer that is attached to your car.
We will also pay any expenses you have our written permission to claim.
Other people
We will also insure:
anyone you allow to drive or use your car as long as your policy schedule allows this

the solicitors fee if anyone we insure is represented at a Coroners Inquest, Fatal Accident Inquiry or Court of Summary Jurisdiction
and for legal services to defend anyone we insure if proceedings are taken for manslaughter or causing death by reckless driving.
We will only pay these legal fees if they arise from an accident that is covered under this policy.

The temporary replacement car will be made available only when full details of the loss or damage are notified to General Accident.
This must be done as soon as possible after any loss, damage or accident.
During the period the hired car will be insured under this policy in exactly the same way as your own car is insured and you will only have to pay for the petrol used.
This service is only available in the United Kingdom.

stolen or lost and not recovered; or
damaged so that repairs will cost more than 60% of its list price (including taxes and the cost of accessories) at the date of the accident
