BIDWELLS
chartered surveyors Dear Sirs, Trustees of The Hinxton Estate Land adjoining 1 High Street, Hinxton
We refer to the Appeal submitted under the above reference against the Planning Refusal by South Cambridgeshire District Council for a single dwelling.
We have received copies of the letters of objection and petition sent to you by local residents.
Whilst we did consider that this site could be developed with a single storey dwelling without seriously affecting the amenities of the village, we were not aware of the strength of local feeling against any development on this site.
Having reviewed the matter, taking the above into consideration, we write formally to withdraw our Appeal, as whilst we consider that it is appropriate that further development should take place in the village, on this occasion we defer to local feeling.
Yours faithfully
