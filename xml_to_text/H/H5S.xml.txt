Hello.
Well 
Hello.

Aha.
What've I to do to you today?
No, it's not him, it's me Doctor .
Is it mum?
Mum.
What'd you do to your mum?
mum for a while.
Were you bad to her?
Were you bad to your mum?
What can I do for you?
My bust again Doctor .
I'm having terrible pains in my chest.
It's only the, the right one,
Mhm.
that I have any pains in.
Now I keep taking this  Shelabruse it clears, and it comes back.
You know how sometimes you get a lot of vein running down 
Mhm.
your bust?
Well it's sinking in, it, it goes into your grove.
Mhm.
But it's still the same, but it's the pains that I got the last time that's gon it's like sharp pains that's going round about, just  the insides of the nipple.
I have put a wee bit of weight on, so I was wondering if it was maybe 
Mhm.
that.
Mhm.
Could be that.
But it's been  for about two month now, but it's
For two months?
aha.
Are you on anything just now
No.
to try and ease the soreness, Cathy?
No.
No.
It isn't, it's not a pain that's there all the time, Doctor .
It just comes.
It just comes.
Is it a sharp sort of shooting pain?
Very sharp it's  as though something's bursting.
You know, something's 
Mhm.
running, it's like that.
Right.
Stop that for you .
I had an appointment and I cancelled it, a couple of month ago, because it wasn't too bad.
Then I had to get this one.
Right.
Now then this er 
I was going to cancel this.
Better not to.
Better not to.
Er my mother's waiting to come in, so I was going to give her it.
Will we give your mum nice medicine or rotten medicine?
Oh he's not really sort of speaking to me.
Is he in a bad mood?
Aye .
In a bad mood this morning?
Are you?
Wee boy playing with the toys out there and they told him to shut up.
Is your gran out there?
His gran's out there.
Is she?
No well.
What've you been doing to your gran?
Were you bad to your gran?
There we are.
What is this Doctor ?
Will you take that for your mum?
That's a boy.
Two things Cathy.
I've given you something to try and take the swelling off your chest, and that should ease a bit of the pain but I've also given you er stuff to stop all this bursting
Mhm.
on the inside.
So  now, I want you to use that for a full month, and come back up, and let us know how things are doing.
Will do.
.
That should give you a good help with that.
Just too heavy busted, I think that's what's .
No no no no no no no, it's nothing to do with that, I wish it was as simple as that.
Right.
Wish it was as simple as that.
Okay Doctor ,
Right Gary?
thank you.
Right, cheerio now.
Cheerio Cathy.
