This project investigates the quantitative and qualitative changes occurring in Irish diet between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries.
The study puts both the Great Famine and the potato in the Irish diet into perspective whilst attempting a nutritional analysis of diet and dietary changes making use of modern nutritional techniques and also the relationship between dietary change and nutritional change and its effects on economic and social conditions.
Research findings may contribute towards a wider interpretation of Irish economic and social history and extend the methodology of dietary history, whilst throwing light on changes in health and disease that follow dietary changes in countries undergoing economic development.

The system of inheritance in rural communities is important, not only in shaping personal relationships within the household and among kinfolk, but also in reproducing property relationships over time.
In the context of Irish rural society in this century, not much is known about who inherits what, and the possible implications for family conflict and solidarity.
For instance, is primogeniture (inheritance by the eldest son) the dominant practice in relation to land inheritance, or is it not?
Do succession patterns differ according to agrarian social class?
What provision is made for non-inheriting sons and daughters?
Are inheritance practices basically inegalitarian, discriminating in particular against female members of rural households?
In investigating these, and related issues, three study areas with contrasting economic structures were selected.
Using a variety of sources — household schedules from the 1911 Census of Ireland, property valuation records, wills, and interviews with elderly landholders — the study identifies and attempts to quantify major aspects of inheritance practices in rural Ireland.

The period immediately before the First World War saw rapid economic and social change in Ireland.
A crucial element in this process was Ireland's unique demographic experience which combined emigration with celibacy and relatively high fertility among those who did marry and remain in Ireland, as mechanisms in balancing population growth against resource development.
In contrast, at the same period in Britain, this balance was achieved by a fall in fertility within marriage, a characteristic which spread through all social classes.
This research aims to examine the extent to which both the British and Irish Catholic demographic strategies contributed to the historical development of the two communities in Northern Ireland.
It will explore the relationships between demography, class, religion and labour market position.
The data source is a computerised sample of household enumeration schedules for Londonderry city and county from the 1911 census of Ireland, held at the Public Record Office, Dublin.
Londonderry was chosen as the focus because the religious balance of the city in 1911 was almost the exact inverse of the county, thus providing a rural/urban dimension to the study.
It is intended that this pilot research will develop a standardised set of procedures with which the investigation can be extended over the remaining Ulster counties which subsequently formed Northern Ireland.
These procedures will also make the database available for the more intensive study of local communities.

The Belfast Newsletter (BNL) index, 1737-1800, is the first comprehensive computerised index of any significant 18th-century newspaper.
Virtually every aspect of life during that era is represented somewhere in the pages of the newspaper so that political, social, economic, military and legal historians of Ireland, Britain, North America, Europe and Australasia, as well as geneologists and a host of others will find it invaluable.
The BNL index can also be used as a cross-reference to other unindexed newspapers of the period.
Working from original issues of the BNL, the investigator has extracted all significant words and dates from the text of each of over 300,000 news items and advertisements.
The resultant online, interactive database is designed to be so easy to use that after a few minutes practice even novices can make very sophisticated searches and will have nearly instantaneous access to a vast storehouse of information hitherto accessible only after tedious, time-consuming and costly searches through individual issues.
Work on the index began in July 1983, and at the present rate of progress the initial data preparation phase should be finished by January 1988.
Thereafter, printed indexes of selected topics of special interest (eg the linen industry, emigration, lands and tenantry, the American Revolution, the 1798 rebellion) will be prepared.

The Ordnance Survey Memoirs are unique sources of information on 19th century Ireland being parish accounts written to accompany the Ordnance Survey Maps.
They interest a wide range of scholars and lay users and deserve to be a standard reference for subject and local historians.
Difficulties of access and physical arrangement restrict their use at present.
The overall aim of the project is to make the contents of the Memoirs available to the public by using computers to prepare material for indexing and by reproduction.
The feasibility project investigates and assesses procedures necessary for putting the manuscript accounts onto microcomputer and then mainframe computer.
Then a subject retrieval programme, QUILL, Queen's University Interrogation for Legal Literature, will be used to produce select indexes, subject and name.
The project should establish the most effective methods of work: from preparing copies of the original documents, editing variant texts of parish Memoirs and production of selected subject indexes from texts input to the computer.
The demonstration of such procedures should have wider applicability to other projects involving the transfer of information from manuscripts to computer.
In the course of the project just under half the parish Memoirs deposited in the Royal Irish Academy are to be prepared for indexing by computer so that these will be available in a printed out form from the microcomputer.
The results of the project, methodological and in hard copy, will be available to academic and other users via the Institute of Irish Studies and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.

It is widely accepted that the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century was preceded by a long period of gradual economic growth, but when the upturn began remains uncertain.
The investigation explores the possibility of using probate inventories to cast light on this and related questions.
Large numbers of inventories of household goods and chattels were exhibited in many probate courts in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries and are preserved in local record offices throughout England and Wales.
The research identifies the areas in which they have survived in sufficient abundance to form the basis of a nationwide sample survey designed to illustrate changes in the level, composition and distribution of household wealth in the centuries leading up to the Industrial Revolution.
The eventual aim is to produce wealth estimates for the entire living population, comparable with those for later periods, and thus make it possible to trace the trends in the accumulation of wealth from the sixteenth century to the present.
The principal method of investigation is a postal inquiry followed by personal visits to selected record offices; an attempt is also being made to assess how representative of the country as a whole the areas that have been selected are.

The social, political, and economic features of modern Latin America have deep historical roots, which those concerned with research into contemporary problems need to uncover.
Historians of the region are fully aware of the importance of using social science techniques in their reconstruction of its past.
This project, undertaken by historians who are familiar with the concerns of economists, sociologists and political scientists, evaluates the historical evolution of the region in southern Peru dominated by Cuzco.
This city was the ancient Inca capital, and throughout Peru's colonial period (1533-1824) it stood as a symbol of regional and ethnic opposition to Spanish rule from Lima.
Particular attention is being paid to the major Indian rebellions which occurred there in the late colonial period (1780 and 1814), to the role of southern Peru in the overthrow of Spanish rule (in 1824), and to political, social, and economic developments in the first three decades after independence.
Land ownership and the life of indigenous communities is also receiving detailed scrutiny.
Background work will be done in national archives in Spain and Peru.
The main sources are rich documentary collections in Cuzco itself.
These include ecclesiastical records, and a large collection in the Departmental Archive which has only recently been made available to researchers.

Ulster has a long tradition of rural industry and peasant agriculture.
In common with a limited number of other regions of the UK, it experienced early industrialisation.
However, the course of prices, incomes and living standards in the province during the formative period of the development of the Ulster economy is virtually unknown.
This study attempts to penetrate this statistical ‘dark age’ by assembling data on prices, incomes and purchasing power in the period 1700-1845.
Tracing and, where possible, explaining changes over time in these fundamental features of economic life is the major task.
Related aims are analysing the spread of market relationships in town and countryside and exploring how local markets for labour and produce became integrated into a unified Ulster economy.
The major historical sources used are newspapers (market reports), parliamentary reports, estate and trade union records.
The complete project should provide a solid statistical base for other enquiries into Ulster economy and society.

At present, anyone wishing to consult the immensely rich Irish newspaper sources must, necessarily, undertake a tedious, time-consuming and costly search through individual issues.
The computerized Belfast Newsletter (BNL) Index 1737-1800 seeks to remedy this situation by providing the first comprehensive index of an 18th-century newspaper: 63 years of the oldest, continuously-published English-language newspaper in the world.
In technical terms, the index employs an uncontrolled, post-coordinate, simple, natural language in an online interactive computer mode.
That is, the indexers extract all significant words and dates found in the news items and advertisements in the extant issues and impose the appropriate subject-headings.
The data are then run through the QUILL program which automatically indexes the material.
Anyone searching the resultant database by means of a computer terminal has almost instantaneous access to every item in the newspaper.
When finished the index will include a total of about 300,000 separate items representing some 8-12 million words.
Data preparation began in July 1983 with the aid of grants now totalling almost 250,000 from the Economic and Social Research Council, the British Library, and the Department of Economic Development, Northern Ireland.
At present the indexers are preparing the newspaper volumes for the years between 1786 and 1790.
The index was demonstrated via a direct Dublin-Belfast datalink at the Eighteenth-Century Ireland Conference at University College, Dublin in April 1987.

This research investigates trends in real wages and the standard of living in Northern England, so as to shed light on the effects of industrialisation, the causes of English population growth, and the origins and economic significance of the home market.
It aims to complement work on the south by this researcher, and so to outline aspects of the growing difference after about 1770 between the high-wage industrial north and the poorly-paid ‘de-industrialising’ south.
Research is focused in particular on the agricultural and cottage-industrial areas of the north.
Two sources are used: poor law settlement records, which can provide evidence on male and female wages, unemployment and on labour mobility to industrial regions, and parish overseers' accounts, which allow detailed analysis of the seasonal and yearly nature of unemployment, and of the administration of the poor law.
Both sources have been neglected by researchers, although they survive in large numbers, and contain very valuable evidence bearing on the British Industrial Revolution, its causes, and its effects on the standard of living.

The social geography of the British industrial city changed considerably during the nineteenth century.
The patterns of change constitute an important source of information in many fields of urban history, and this project will explore the experience of Glasgow — the ‘second city’ of the Empire.
The main part of the research involves entering on computer information on every house occupier in Glasgow at different dates between 1861 and 1901.
From this information, taken from the rates valuation rolls, it will be possible not only to describe the social structure of each part of the city but to assess the factors which determined patterns of social segregation: factors such as income, the operation of the speculative building market, employment, the role of local government, recreational facilities, and industrial and commercial enterprise.
The research will help in understanding the way in which the structure and layout of cities changes, and will additionally produce a valuable data source for subsequent investigators.

Glasgow's nineteenth century housing reformers were unanimous in agreeing that the nature of property ownership was a crucial determinant in the development of the city's urban fabric.
Historians have concurred in this view.
Despite this agreement we know little about the identity of Glasgow's property owners, the scale on which they operated, or their social and economic status.
The mystery surrounding the identity of property owners can be partly explained by a typical Victorian reticence concerning financial matters.
However, for the historian the problem lies not in the absence of data, but rather in the bulk of the material available to him.
The Valuation Roll series provide full information on the identity of property owners, their occupation and the type of property owned.
Compiled annually, it is a voluminous source which can now be fully exploited for the first time using computer techniques.
This project constructs a database of property owners in Glasgow at benchmark years (1861, 1881, 1911) using data contained in this source.
The database is a starting point for a detailed reconstruction of the city's housing market.
This allows an assessment of the influence of property ownership on the development of the Victorian and Edwardian city.

At a major international conference on the slave trade held in Nantes in 1985, it was noted with concern how few of the contributions were on the ‘Eastern’ trade.
It was thus proposed to organise two workshops on this topic for the 19th century, one on the trade across the Indian Ocean, and a later one on the trans-Saharan trade.
The Indian ocean workshop is to be held in London in December 1987 and is to concentrate on the demand for slaves in the ‘East’, the financing of the trade, the ‘middle passage’, and the conditions of slave gathering in Africa.
We are especially keen to bring together scholars working on the ‘East’ with those working on Africa.

Tourism has developed with considerable speed into one of the major industries of the modern world, and much of its current shape and nature is the result of British innovation during the past 150 years.
Thomas Cook and his family were without doubt the single most important innovators, establishing not only a major business enterprise but methods of operation that were to have global implications.
They took the rapidly changing circumstances of transport, social change and wealth as the backcloth to the introduction of radically new leisure travel experiences.
Cook's innovations are already well known at a general level, with the inclusive guided tour and the traveller's cheque system being perhaps the best known.
However little detailed research has been undertaken into how these innovations were developed and implemented, and this project will make use of the unique Company Archive of the Thomas cook organisation to investigate the detailed circumstances of product development in a crucial period of the Company's development from 1850 to 1939, during which the foundations of the modern tourist industry were laid.

The reasons for the surrender of their own control over policy-making by west European nations in the 1950s remain unclear.
Convincing objections have been raised to every theoretical explanation which has so far been provided.
The research will investigate the archives of ministries involved in formulating policies which came in the 1950s to be subject to the control of international agreements between more than two west European countries.
It will do so in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, The German Federal Republic, Italy and the Netherlands.
In addition official records of the USA and private papers will be examined.
The policies chosen are; the management of the coal, iron and steel industries, the management of the European Payments Union, the management of some aspects of nuclear research, and the commercial policies agreed in the OEEC and in the Treaty of Rome.
The research will also examine areas where there was a refusal to abandon sole national control over policy in the face of proposals to do so.
Examples of this are: transport policy, labour migration, common roles for agricultural trade, and a common army.
It is hoped to provide a convincing explanation of why such surrenders of so-called national sovereignty were or were not to the advantage of nations.
This would lead to a clearer understanding of the relationships between international organisations, such as the European Community, which have acquired a measure of control over national policy, and the nations themselves.

Considerable interest exists today in relation to the problems of the inner city.
Various policy initiatives have addressed the question of how to reverse the decay, deprivation and industrial degeneration of a century.
Yet policy makers, planners and local government officials have a limited grasp of the historical development of nineteenth century cities and the project attempts to investigate the principal factors which governed that process, the problems it highlighted and the pitfalls which have been encountered and which need not be reproduced in the twentieth century given an awareness of a historical dimension.
Though this project is principally concerned with the city of Edinburgh its relevance is much wider, to British cities in general and it is expected that it will demonstrate how land-owners, builders, house factors and other interests in property were able to control the pace and pattern of urban development largely to their own ends without recognising the long term consequences for the physical shape and quality of the housing and building stock and its long term impact on modern society in terms of street lay outs, maintenance and repairs, and the availability of open spaces.
Understanding how the face of urban Britain emerged in the nineteenth century may pin-point how to tackle certain of the present problems, and, conceivably, identify the factors which set the die for urban life in the next century.

This project aims to provide an historical survey of the attitudes towards new productive techniques exhibited by British businessmen from, approximately, the industrial revolution to the onset of recovery after the Second World War.
Much has been written on the performance of British business during the period and many attempts have been made to explain, excuse or refute what has been seen as a decline in British innovative ability since the successes of the industrial revolution.
Explanations range from sophisticated economic arguments concerning specific industries to very general notions about something called ‘the decline of the industrial spirit’.
The present inquiry examines in what ways the attitudes to new techniques were affected by unique circumstances of our pioneer industrial revolution; tries to assess the extent to which Victorian businessmen and their successors failed to comprehend that a continuous regard for new techniques was a condition of survival in a competitive system; considers the effects of two World Wars on technical innovation; and presents the achievements and failures in a broad historical context.

The history of nonconformity in recent years has been characterised by the closure of many places of worship.
This project aims to identify the local leaders who were responsible for chapels, schoolrooms and manses in a period of nonconformist growth, to study their place in the religious bodies they served and in the communities where they lived.
The project will be based on an analysis of the social composition of trustees of nonconformist buildings.
These men were responsible for the maintenance of places for which they acted and for ensuring that worship was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the bodies to which they belonged.
As buildings have been closed their title deeds giving the names, places of residence, occupations and an indication as to whether trustees could sign their names, have been dispersed.
However, this information has been preserved because of the practice of enrolling the deeds in Chancery.
By studying the material on trustees in these enrolments for selected districts of Lincolnshire it is hoped to build up a picture of who they were, the ways in which they changed in the period of the study as well as any specific characteristics of the trustees of different denominations.

The vast changes in the social, political and economic life of Asia in the nineteenth century were mediated by a profound alteration in the mental world of the Asian elites, especially the intelligentsia.
Their world-view, expectations from life and even their emotional responses were reshaped by the challenge of Europe's dominance, encounter with the western civilisation and absorption into an international economy.
The Bengali intelligentsia, the first sizeable social group in Asia to come into close contact with a European nation, were also the first to experience such a revolution in their mental world.
This research project aims to reconstruct that process of transformation, the changes in outlook, concerns, attitudes and sensibilities and trace the sources of that change.
Memoirs, biographies, letters didactic works, newspapers, fiction, ephemera and relics of the changing life-style will be explored to identify the new concerns and responses in many areas of life, intra-family and intra-personal relationships, perceptions of the individual's obligations to society and state, religions and cultural sensibilities and the image of the good life.
The nexus between these altered attitudes and new patterns of social (including political) action will be analysed to establish how the efforts at innovation were informed by the quiet revolution in mentality.

This project aims to provide historians and librarians with an essential reference tool for the study of London history from the Anglo-Saxon period to the outbreak of the Second World War.
London is defined here as the City of London plus the area formerly administered by the Greater London Council.
Useful books and articles on most aspects of London history will be included, if published before the end of 1990.
The work includes published editions of documents and calendars of primary sources, and short descriptive notes are given where necessary.
The bibliography is arranged in period sections, subdivided by subject.
Archaeological material is excluded because it is being collected by a different project, and visual material must unfortunately be omitted through lack of space.
Most of the material so far has been keyed directly on to a computer housed at Guildhall Library.
Other important London history collections will be searched in due course.

Between 1690 and 1870 London emerged as the world centre for financial, insurance, and commodity markets.
The project aims to study the impact of this upon the fabric of that central area of the city where financial and insurance services were housed.
During this period the traditional pattern, in which shops, counting-houses, warehouses, and places of residence were intermixed within districts associated with specialised groups of trades, was replaced by one in which central areas were characterised by more restricted ranges of activities practised in new types of large scale building.
At the same time the city centre ceased to be a place where people dwelled.
In the financial district this was accompanied by the appearance and proliferation of the trading centres known as exchanges, of speculative office blocks, and of large buildings constructed for single clients such as banks and insurance companies.
The method will be to construct a chronological sequence of overviews of the study area based on taxation records, directories, and other sources (including maps), paying particular attention to occupations, residence, changes in property holding, and land values.
This will establish for the first time a knowledge of the process by which characteristic feature of the modern metropolis emerged.
The research will also seek to identify sources which throw light on the activities and attitudes of the individuals and institutions who brought changes about.
This will lay a foundation for future investigation within a framework established by this project.

The city of Glasgow is famous for its pioneering development of council housing in the days of the ‘Red Clyde’.
Now, the rundown state of much of that council housing is equally notorious.
Yet the story of the development of the city's housing schemes has never been told in full, and particularly not from the point of view of the original tenants.
This research aims to document how the Corporation of Glasgow developed its housing scheme in firstly, the inter-war years, and secondly, the immediate postwar years.
It will trace how the city operated the different Housing Acts, how it developed its housing management policy, and how its schemes came to have the distinctive social characteristics which they possess.
Further, it will document the experience of families as they moved out of the old tenements, often slums, into their new houses in the new schemes.
The research will focus on two broad categories of housing scheme: those built in the interwar years, and the four large peripheral estates built in the postwar years.
The method of investigation is essentially twofold: analysis of Housing Management Department records and other official documents, and interviewing of tenants.

‘Economics’ as a subject for teaching and for research in University Institutions, became established in Britain at the end of the nineteenth century.
While it was at first related to a vocational interest in commerce and administration, it developed during the twentieth century into a specialist and academic science, rather than a field of practical commercial study.
This investigation seeks to extend our limited understanding of this major aspect of British economics by studying the development of departments of commerce and economics in British universities and colleges, their syllabi, the careers of students and teachers, and their relation to the development of an economic profession.
The development of such teaching within a university context will necessarily be combined with broader understanding of the development of higher education in Britain in the early decades of this century.
This ‘institutional’ approach will be combined with a study of journal literature, textbooks and other publications, hitherto the most ‘visible’product of the newly-emergent discipline.
Since this will involve a substantial amount of archival and institutional research the study has been provisionally limited to the period 1890-1930.
The overview of the development of the British economics as a subject of study and research that will result from this should cast new light on the manner in which economics became a ‘science’ and commercial educational a vocational and practical affair.

The social geography of the British industrial city changed considerably during the nineteenth century.
The patterns of change constitute an important source of information in many fields of urban history, and this project will explore the experience of Glasgow — the ‘second city’ of the Empire.
The main part of the research involves entering on computer information on every house occupier in Glasgow at different dates between 1861 and 1901.
From this information, taken from the rates valuation rolls, it will be possible not only to describe the social structure of each part of the city but to assess the factors which determined patterns of social segregation: factors such as income, the operation of the speculative building market, employment, the role of local government, recreational facilities, and industrial and commercial enterprise.
The research will help in understanding the way in which the structure and layout of cities changes, and will additionally produce a valuable data source for subsequent investigators.

The peculiarities of Ulster's political and religious life clearly confuse most outside observers.
Ulster is thought to be distinctive within both the United Kingdom and the island of Ireland.
Yet the historical development of this distinctive area, particularly the interaction between religious, political and cultural identities, is still largely unresearched.
Since no amount of economic reductionism or political explanation alone will expose the roots and distinctive characteristics of the province of Ulster by the late Victorian period, the aim of this investigation is to concentrate specifically on the important contribution made by evangelical religion, from the early penetration by Methodism in the mid eighteenth century to the political crises surrounding Home Rule at the end of the nineteenth century.
As much of this religious enthusiasm was exported from Britain by the London-based evangelical missionary societies it will be necessary to consult those archives as well as the records of Irish churches and voluntary religious societies.
By uncovering the contribution made by ‘serious’ religion to the wider Ulster society by c1900 this study will make more comprehensible many neglected aspects of life and custom in the twentieth-century Ulster.
This investigation is therefore intended to be both a serious historical research project based on a dozen or more geographically dispersed archives and a contribution to the wider understanding of a society at the centre of much attention but little insight.

An important policy issue concerns the effectiveness of import controls as an instrument for alleviating Britain's economic decline.
The research, by evaluating the experience of the UK in the 1930's, aims to test the hypothesis that the discouragement of imports through duties or licensing systems, increased the demand for the products of British industry and stimulated the expansion of manufacturing output.
The analysis of the effects of protection on the UK economy in the 1930's is being conducted at three levels; an inter-industry comparison, evaluation of the macroeconomic impact and a comparison of the UK's experience with the other main industrial countries.
At each level a comparison is being made of performance between the pre-protection (1924-31) and post-protection (1931-37) period.
Additionally, the research attempts to disentangle the impact on industrial recovery of other factors, in particular the stimulus provided by increased competitiveness due to the fall in sterling's effective exchange rate.
Substantial analysis of published statistics will be undertaken utilising data from the Census of Production (1924, 1930, 1935) the Board of Trade, and the Customs and Excise Department.

This project is a contribution to Volume V11 of the multi volume Agrarian History of England and Wales, some of which volumes have been published at intervals since 1967.
Volume V11 will cover the period 1850-1914.
The project is designed to perform three tasks.
firstly it will co-ordinate the statistical findings of a team of sub-editors who are working on many aspects of Agrarian history in the period.
Secondly, and arising out of the first function, it will produce a substantial statistical digest of basis data which is designed to serve the needs of future generations of Agrarian historians who investigate the period 1850-1914.
Thirdly, and in like fashion building upon the first two functions there will be produced a series of indexes which will measure performance of the agricultural sector in the period 1850-1914, to include the calculation of the output of agriculture and its contribution to the national economy
The method of investigation is a cross-combination of the archival researches of the team of sub-editors and the personal research of the investigators into the annual agricultural census, which is reported in British Parliamentary Paper, amongst other sources.

There has been considerable debate about the relationship between pre-factory domestic manufacture and demographic change, including migration.
But the impact of vestry policy on population movements and particularly on the supply of labour to industry and its cost has been little explored at parish level.
This study aims to discover patterns of migration of labour within and between the townships of Calverley parish and to look at the role of vestry policy upon this and also upon movement into and out of the parish.
Other aspects of the influence of the vestry upon the nature of textile manufacturing in the parish will also be considered.
The study involves the transfer of parish register material for the c.1770-1820 and late eighteenth/early nineteenth century vestry data into machine-readable form.
It will then be possible to make a detailed analysis of demographic structures and population movements in relation to occupational groups and specifically to textile occupations.
The role of poor relief, the Settlement law, pauper apprenticeship and other aspects of vestry administration upon the growth of industry can also be assessed.
The project uses IBM's Interactive Standard Query Language data- base on the IBM 3083 mainframe at Liverpool and is innovative in using this software for historical research.
The research follows an earlier (1987) successful study of the same issues for the period c.1660-1770 which was financed for three months byu The Nuffield Foundation and aided by a British Academy grant for travel and consumables.

This research examines the consequences of changes in Government policies for two aspects of working class family life:
(i)
family employment patterns; and
(ii)
the extent to which the family took on responsibility from other institutions for the poor, the sick, the old and the unemployed.
Working class family life was subject to varying customs and conditions in different industries and to local variation in the administration of legislation; therefore, it is best studied in a particular area, in this case, the Staffordshire Potteries.
Two legislative changes during the third quarter of the 19th century the extension of the Factory Acts in the 1860s and the Education Act of 1870 restricted the employment of children in the Potteries.
By comparing family employment patterns in 1861 and 1881 in recently opened census enumerators' books and using other sources, the research explores the ways families adjusted to this change.
In the 1870s, the central government forced local Guardians to reduce expenditure on out-relief.
By comparing residence patterns in 1861 and 1881 and examining poor law administration, the research investigates how far the new harsh administration of the Poor Law increased reliance on family and kin for assistance.

Late eighteenth-century Britain witnessed the emergence of a specialist capital-goods sector, as the demand for production machinery both increased and required more specialized skills.
This study will examine the extent to which this capital-goods sector provided a major stimulus to invention and innovation in the century after 1780.
Prima facie, the development of a capital-goods sector should have created a vested interest in innovation in the consumer-goods industries, as well as a major new outlet for independent inventors of production machinery.
But how far did the capital-goods sector fulfil this function in nineteenth-century Britain?
Should we look to it for a pool of inventive talent that actively embodied novelty in its products, and thereby provided pressure for technical change among its customers; or rather, for provision of engineering skills that responded passively to the demands made upon it by the inventiveness of its clients consumer industries and civil engineers?
Initially, the answer will be pursued through the patent records, to identify inventors.
Then, using company archives, parliamentary reports and other contemporary printed materials, the business relations between capital-goods producers and their clients will be examined, to discover which sector usually held the patents and how actively, or restrictively, they exploited them.

Epidemic disease has long fascinated historians, and its study has proved to be only too relevant to the present day.
The project will be the first direct comparison of the effects of plague on two major cities in seventeenth-century Europe: Florence and London.
The epidemics which have been chosen (1630-33 in Italy and 1665 in England) are well known from the descriptions of contemporary writers, and there are excellent official records, generated at both government and parish level, from which it is possible to assess the status of the victims.
The contrast between the two cities will enable us to examine how far geographical, topographical.
climatic, and social factors affect the impact of epidemic disease in an urban environment.
Building on the work of previous historians, the project will examine in detail the effects of epidemic disease at the local level in a selected number of parishes within each city.
Outline case histories will be built up concerning many thousands of individual victims.
Analysis of these will establish exactly which types of people were affected worst: whether they were male or female, young or old.
single or married, or living in nuclear or multiple households.
It will also reveal the impact of disease according to the status of households, as defined by their relative wealth, by the occupations of their heads and co-residents, and by their location within the city.

The British Cabinet has been the focal point of much general argument among students of politics, but there have been very few detailed case-studies produced which show how individual decisions were made at that level.
There has been even less serious interest in how foreign policy has been handled in Cabinet.
The research aims to fill these two gaps, by focusing on six key decisions in British foreign policy in the time between the Munich agreement and the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.
It uses the extensive Cabinet Minutes of the period, and many collections of private papers, to construct an explanation of policy in terms which give due weight to the nature of Cabinet government itself, and to the role of the Prime Minister in the area of external relations.
The model of top-level policy-making it generates will be applicable outside the specific context of 1938-41, and is intended to aid our understanding of both British politics and the nature of foreign policy as an activity.
The project is a single-author piece of political analysis, using ideas and methods drawn from psychology and sociology, as well as history and political science.

There has been considerable revival of interest in the behaviour of the British Economy during the interwar period.
The persistence of unemployment in the 1970s and 1980s has made the experience of the interwar years seem more relevant to economic policy making than that of the 1950s and 1960s.
The recent emergence of macroeconomic theories emphasizing the supply side the economy has called into question the previous Keynesian orthodoxy, which concentrated upon fluctuations in aggregate demand.
Historically the Keynesian demand side approach evolved from the experience of the interwar economy, but recent studies, such as those by Matthews and Benstock and Warburton, suggest that a classical model can adequately explain economic behaviour in the interwar period.
During the 1920's and 1930's the British economy was subject to a sequence of shocks arising from the postwar deflation of the early 1920's, the restoration of the gold standard and the world depression of 1929-32.
The purpose of this project is to develop an income expenditure model which will combine demand and supply side elements and will examine the impact of these shocks.
It should permit an appraisal to be made of the relative impact of aggregate demand and the supply side on output and employment in the British economy.
This should enable some judgement to be reached in the reliance of both Classical and Keynesian approaches to interwar macroeconomic behaviour.
The project may also serve to contrast the behaviour of the economy in the 1920's and the 1930's with the experience before 1914.
The results of the study should be of interest to both macroeconomists and economic historians.

In accounts of women's struggle for the vote in Britain, Scottish women active in England are subsumed amongst their English colleagues while those active in Scotland remain unknown; Scottish cities are treated as provincial English cities.
Yet Scotland had a separate legal system, a separate prison system, and historically a very different cultural background.
This study will examine the distinctively Scottish elements in the suffrage movement.
The very diversity of the Scottish experience, from the views and activities of the constitutional suffragist, Bady Frances Balfour, to the continuing connection in Glasgow between the working-class suffragettes and the Independent Labour Party (at a time when the WSPU in England had become very middle class) makes it particularly worth studying.
A wide range of source material will be examined, including the prison and court records of militant suffragettes jailed in Scotland, minute books of Scottish women's suffrage associations, and newspaper reports, memoirs, and letters of suffragists, suffragettes, and those who opposed women's suffrage.
The aim will be to broaden our understanding both of the suffrage movement in Britain and of modern Scottish history.

The estate of the Pelham family, later Earls of Yarborough, which was centred on their seat at Brocklesby Hall, comprised at its height in the nineteenth century 56,795 acres.
It was established by Sir William Pelham, who began to purchase land in Lincolnshire from about 1565.
Some land was disposed of in 1891, but in 1948 over 10,000 acres were sold, marking a significant turning point in the estate's history.
This project will, through a study based largely on the Yarborough papers at the Lincolnshire Archives Office, analyse the strategies adopted to develop and maintain the estate.
These will be related to its function i providing for the personal lifestyles of the Pelham family as well as its role as a local and national power base.
It will include a study of the extension of the estate into Grimsby, stimulated initially by the town's status as a parliamentary borough.
Together with the Earls; interests in the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company, this provided a source of urban and industrial investment as the town developed in the nineteenth century and an assessment will be made of their significance in the overall strategies employed in the management of the estate.

Accounts survive from over 50 collieries within this period, the earliest series dates from the mid-fifteenth century but the great majority are from the seventeenth century.
Colliery accounts are a neglected source yet they contain a mass of information on capital investment, costs of production, productivity and profits, with the most detailed of them providing information on individual colliers, output for man/shift, number of days worked, wage rates and earnings.
By analysing these accounts it should prove possible to add significantly to our knowledge of the capital requirements of the industry, in terms of both fixed capital costs and the running investment needed to maintain output.
The research will also study patterns of employment and conditions of work in early modern collieries.

This three year study will explore empirically and theoretically the changing structure and significance of the linkages between corporate R&D and academic research in the UK over the last decade.
One of the main impacts of the new basic technologies like molecular electronics and ceramic superconductivity has been an apparent growth in the science dependence of many industrial sectors.
This has led companies to expand their in-house basic research efforts, and to devote more resources to monitoring scientific research trends world wide and tracking the R&D activities of their competitors.
At the same time governments in most industrial nations have responded by focussing their R&D support away from applied programmes to longer term strategic research.
As a result, one of the central policy priorities of government has been to strengthen significantly the academic infrastructure so that research and postgraduate training activities are adequate to meet the future needs of industry, especially in what have been termed ‘exploitable areas of science’.
This has focussed their attention on just how little is still known about the knowledge transfer interface between universities and industry, the mechanisms by which science impacts on technology, and the development dynamics of emerging fields of exploitable science.
The study is based on the hypothesis that basic research is increasingly important in technological innovation and that analysis of publication output provides a viable means of studying corporate basic research activities.
Various bibliometric and patent-based techniques will be used, supplemented with in-depth interviews with a sample of 10-15 companies.

In the eighteenth century rural society in the Scottish lowlands was transformed as traditional agriculture was reformed, peasant holdings consolidated and the majority of the rural population reduced to the status of landless wage labourers.
This project will examine the social impact of these changes on the structure and standards of the people.
It will trace the chronology and spatial distribution of the ‘new’ agriculture and explore the influences which promoted its expansion.
A major issue to be explored is why social disruption failed to stimulate unrest in lowland Scotland unlike other areas of Britain at this time.
Though cast in a Scottish framework it is hoped that the project will also shed light on the general process of agrarian modernisation in western Europe.
The research will be mainly concerned with a systematic examination of estate papers in private and public hands though other contemporary material will also be scrutinised.

The social cost of drink-related traffic accidents in Britain is very high: over 18,000 casualties, including 5000 deaths in 1986.
Social attitudes, influenced by widespread publicity campaigns, are hardening against the drinking driver; and demands for tougher sentencing policies, or for new legislation on random breath tests, are heard more frequently.
This historical project will study the growth of this problem in 20th- century Britain, and the ways in which Parliament, the police, and society more generally have responded to it.
There will be a statistical comparison of the problem in England and Scotland, relating traffic accidents to the level of car ownership and drink consumption.
Changing police tactics and sentencing policies will be discussed in studies of local areas.
The research will also focus on the role of medical and scientific research, particularly the use of breathalysers and other tests.
The role of pressure groups such as the drink industry and motoring organizations will be considered.
Research materials will include national archive sources, local police record, and oral information.
The study is intended to provide a historical background of use to those currently concerned with the problem, and as a source of reference to policy-makers.

There is a traditional image, outlined in most popular police histories, that the English policemen who served in the period from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries were recruited from artless agricultural labourers.
But no serious systematic analysis has ever been made of the recruits, or of their careers as policemen.
This failure has been due, at least in part, to historians being unaware of the documentation which survives in the hands of the different police forces.
A study supported by the ESRC between 1986 and 1989 enabled the archives of the police forces in England and Wales to be catalogued; it also enabled some pilot studies to be conducted into the recruitment patterns of the different forces, and the careers of policemen.
The research project aims to construct and then analyse a simple database containing the biographical and career details of several thousand policemen who served between 1840 and 1940.
The study should provide a major contribution to our knowledge of the English Police.
The database itself, which will be deposited with the ESRC Data Archive, will also be of immense value to subsequent researchers interested in migration and morphological studies of the working class.

The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) policed Ireland for nearly ninety years.
It was unlike other British forces in that its members were armed and subjected to military discipline.
Also its duties were much broader in scope than those of other forces, including, for instance, the collection of census and other statistical date and the surveillance of political suspects and meetings.
The RIC offered a model of colonial policing and in fact many officers from forces as far afield as Kenya, Jamaica and Canada were trained at its headquarters in Dublin.
Although the RIC was a vital arm of British administration in Ireland, to say nothing of being a model for police forces throughout the Empire, it has never been fully studied.
Partly perhaps because policing remains a controversial and sensitive subject in Ireland.
This project thus aims to fill an important gap by providing the first comprehensive study of policing in Ireland from the 1830s to the 1920s.
It will examine:
(1)
the nature of the RIC, particularly its composition, structure and duties;
(2)
the impact of the RIC on Ireland;
(3)
the influence of the RIC on imperial and British police forces;
(4)
the continuing reputation of the RIC; and
(5)
the lessons the RIC's experience offers in the context of current policing problems in Ireland.

Recent publications in business history have examined either banks or industrial companies but have paid less attention to their mutual ties.
In the research project the interaction of banking and industry and its impact on industrially advanced economies is intended to be central to the investigation.
It is designed to examine credit policies and investment behaviour of banks in their relations to industrial enterprise in three industrially advanced European economies (Austria, Hungary and Sweden) in the interwar period.
Striking similarities are found to exist in the development of bank-industry relations in Central European and Scandinavian countries when economic growth of European industrial nations is compared since the turn of the century.
In those economies universal banks largely performed the functions of the capital market because of the relatively slow penetration of financial markets into business practice of these regions.
The banks utilized domestic and foreign financial resources, they were shareholders of and suppliers of credits to domestic and foreign industrial companies, they combined the short-term business of deposit banking with the long-term business of investment banking and also provided stockbroker services, managed their clients' portfolios, acquired shares and voted their own and their customers' stock at general meetings of joint-stock companies.
Except for Britain and France this type of banking became prevalent in continental Europe during the buoyant expansion of capitalism since the 1880s and close relationships between industrial companies and banks built up everywhere basically on the same lines, even though their evolution proceeded rather differently in different countries.
Indeed, these relationships survived and are influencing credit-financing of industry to this day.
It is proposed to investigate these relationships in historical context applying comparative and quantitative methods.

The Lord Chancellor occupies a unique constitutional position in England.
He sits as a judge in the House of Lords, where he also acts as Speaker; he is a cabinet minister and advises on constitutional issues; and his department, established in 1885, is our nearest approach to a Ministry of Justice and has responsibility for many aspects of the legal system.
The papers of the Lord Chancellor's Department which are open to inspection in the Public Record Office are therefore a valuable but under-used source of information for the study of recent political and social history, public administration and law.
They bear on important constitutional and political questions; cover the preparation, passage and implementation of statutes on a wide variety of subjects, such as property law, criminal law and bankruptcy; deal with the administration of justice, including the organisation and working of the courts, the appointment of judges and magistrates, the regulation of legal aid and the legal profession; and also relate to the process and substance of law reform, including the proceedings of numerous commissions and inquiries.
Through an examination of the files down to 1551, it is intended to produce a more detailed guide to the contents of these records than is available at present, so that they may be used more easily and become better known.

Cotton has traditionally been awarded a central role in the history of industrialisation.
It has also been depicted in its formative period of development as the site of bitter industrial strife.
Scotland's experience in this respect is no different to England.
However, after 1850 the two countries' experiences begin to diverge.
Both evolved a stable set of industrial relations, but while in the latter case it was achieved within the context of increasing output, the industry in Scotland was characterised by declining output and productivity and eventual collapse of the traditional spinning and weaving branches.
Thus the contradiction of stable industrial relations, low productivity and poor management constitutes the main focus of the study.
Previous attempts to explain the emergence of peaceful industrial relations in cotton based on concepts such as paternalism and gender are inadequate to explain developments in Scotland as they are inconsistent with the country's experience.
Thus the project wishes to focus on additiorial areas of injury including, managerial strategies, that is, the methods used to communicate the goals of the enterprise to the workforce; the work process, that is , the distribution of power and authority in the workplace and the divisions of the workers on the basis of income and status; migration, that is , the study of worker satisfaction, in as much as a stable working population is an indication of employee loyalty; ethnic and religious divisions, that is , whether religion and nationality was used to divide workers by allocating jobs on the basis of these factors; and, lastly, women and trade unionism, that is , the degree of workers' identification with an alternative loyalty structure to that of the enterprise.
By examining these areas in respect to both the declining sections of Scottish cotton and, conversely, the expanding area of cotton thread manufacture, it is hoped to draw some conclusions about the role played by industrial relations in the process of decline and renewal in industry.
The principal method of inquiry is analysis of company records and other contemporary sources.
A bibliographical search was carried out previous to the award being granted in the period Jan/March 1989.

The objective of the research is a detailed examination of the economic policy-making of the Labour Government 1945.
The particular focus is on the macro-economic objectives of that government.
The issues to be examined include
(i)
what that government saw as its primary macroeconomic policy objectives;
(ii)
how it attempted to translate the 1944 White Paper on Employment Policy, which committed it to pursue ‘a high and stable level of employment’, into action;
(iii)
what theoretical arguments were deployed within the policy-making machinery in relation to that particular objective;
(iv)
how far, and in what manner, the other standard objectives of postwar macro policy — balance of payments equilibrium, low inflation, economic growth — were perceived and pursued.
In summary, the research aims at a detailed examination of the policy-making process.
The bulk of the research will be carried out at the Public Record Office, looking at the internal workings of the policy-making machine, though also with an awareness of the theoretical issues which are raised by the pioneer attempts to manage the economy in this period.

Both wills and inventories have long been used by historians of the late sixteenth to mid-eighteenth centuries.
This project is a full-scale investigation of the third and virtually unknown type of probate document, the probate account, which was filed a year after death and listed all deductions from an estate.
Probate accounts are an abundant and valuable source of information on subjects which are not easily studied elsewhere: the importance of funerals as social occasions; details of medical care; the extent and operation of the credit market; payment of the rents, taxes and tithes; the costs of maintaining and educating children; the materials and making of clothing; and the range and prices of food and goods available in the retail market, The financial distribution detailed in accounts also illuminates the emotional structure of family relationships.
Approximately 30,000 probate accounts survive, and these will all be catalogued and indexed by subject, as well as name and location, to be published by the British Record Society together with an extended introduction analysing the results of our survey.
The index will facilitate access to the documents and provide historians with many future years of research into the family, childhood, costume, death, medicine, consumer goods, landholding, and credit in the early modern period.

For more than a quarter of a century historians have been using computers to help analyse voting behaviour in English parliamentary elections.
Poll books recording the electoral choices of individual voters are common survivals from the years before the Secret Ballot Act of 1872, but are more numerous for borough than for county constituencies, and have all too frequently been studied in isolation from other types of evidence.
This project aims to achieve a clearer understanding of all the contextual factors influencing decisions made by voters in a representative English country during the so-called ‘first age of paraty,’ thereby making a significant contribution to knowledge in the fields of historical psephology and eighteenth-century political history.
In particular, the mechanisms of landlord-influence in rural and urban communities will be looked at in some detail with a view to explaining the variable incidence of the ‘deferential’ and ‘participatory’types of voting identified by previous research.
This study will reach beyond the poll books themselves to consider tax assessments, rentals, manorial records and other documentary sources able to supply information about named individuals.
Data relating to a carefully constructed sample of voters from selected townships within the count will be linked together and subjected to intensive computer analysis using software tools especially developed by the research team.

This research project aims at providing a systematic treatment of the relationship between money, prices, income, interest rates and exchange rates, taking account of the changing institutional environment and placing the variables in the correct historical context.
The principal objectives are to identify the nature of the relationships under different conditions (fixed and floating exchange rates; periods of rising and falling prices) and to add to our understanding of particular dramatic episodes in economic history such as the ‘great depression’ of 1929-32.
The project assesses the impact of monetary policy on the changing structure of the banking industry on both prices and incomes.

The project is concerned with the relationship between the training and employment of women during the Second World War and the immediate post war period.
The central research question is whether wartime training altered women's position in the labour market on either a temporary or a permanent basis.
The project involves two types of research methodology:
(a)
the analysis of the official papers of government departments concerned with training policy during and after the war, available in the Public Record Office in London and other archives.
(b)
the analysis of the education, training and employment histories of a targeted sample of forty women who worked in munitions or the Armed Forces during the war.
These personal histories will be compiled from a combination of contemporary documentation where available, for instance in the Mass-Observation Archive at Sussex University, and oral history interviews.
The analysis will be conducted inn relation to theories about women's position in the labour market and the role of training in relation to it, such as human capital theory and the theory of capitalist patriarchy.

The project explores the complex social, economic and political factors which lay behind variations in the characteristics of labour recruitment and employment by the early oil industry in the Arabian Gulf.
These are essential to a full interpretation of the patterns and processes of early migration in the region and its influence on the contemporary labour market.
Attention focuses on the role of foreign workers in the emerging oil industry.
Particularly important determinants of manpower policy were the composition and management of the oil companies (British, American or Joint Anglo-American) and their relationship with the host governments; the latter being either independent (Saudi Arabia) or under varying degrees of British control (Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar).
Wider international issues such as the Persian claim to Bahrain, Indian independence and the Palestine war, also played an important role in shaping manpower recruitment and migration.
Conditions of employment, accommodation, training and the relations between foreign and local workers are also being examined in this study of early labour history in the oil industry.
Using various archival sources and oral histories, a series of case studies compare and contrast the experience of individual countries, companies and communities.

The main source for prices in the manorial era and beyond is the Beveridge Archive at the London School of Economics.
Although the archive has been used from time to time by researchers in pursuit of specific information, no general survey of the contents has been undertaken since the death of Lord Beveridge in 1963.
Part was published in the 1939 work Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Centuries, but there remains a mass of data and comments written by Beveridge himself and his many research assistants.
The research includes analysis of unpublished data from the Winchester Bishopric Pipe Rolls, enabling historians to closely monitor prices and wages, as well as yields of grain and other commodities up to 1550.
There are also data from the Durham Palatinate records held at the University of Durham on prices and wages, material considered of particular importance by Beveridge since the published work of 1939 did not contain this material, being concentrated mainly south of a line from the Bristol Channel to the Humber.
Thirdly, the archive also contains information for a large number of commodities at Canterbury not previously published as well as material on wages and building costs for the period 1600-1774.
Other data cover King's Hall and Trinity College, Cambridge, Norwich, Croyland Abbey, Dover and the records of the building of London Bridge.
It is the aim of this research to tabulate and collate the unpublished information to provide a published resum'e of the most extensive data on prices and wages ever compiled in this country.

In recent years the evidence of court rolls has been used extensively to try to reconstruct the character of society.
especially rural society, in medieval England and to answer some of the basic questions relating to it.
This project aims to draw on court roll evidence to answer similar questions in Wales.
It will be based on the exceptionally rich sequence of court rolls for the fourteenth century for the lordship of Dyffryn Clwyd, i.e. the town of Ruthin and its extensive rural hinterland.
The fourteenth century was a momentous century in the history of Wales.
It opens a few years after the final English conquest of Wales in 1282/3; it closes with the outbreak of the last great Welsh revolt.
that of Owain Glyn Dwr in September 1400.
Detailed analysis of the court rolls should help towards a closer understanding of the character and transformation of Welsh society during this period.
The analysis will focus on social and economic aspects of Welsh society and land tenure, on relationships between native Welsh and settler English populations and institutions and on the processes of law-keeping, litigation and dispute-resolution.
The project is seen as a contribution to the study of medieval Welsh society and to an understanding of the nature and potential of court-roll evidence for the study of medieval society.

The need for a substantial general bibliography dealing with London history has long been felt by historians, librarians, and archivists.
This project aims to publish an extensive listing of books and articles on most aspects of the history of London from the Dark ages to 1939.
It defines London as the whole of the area formerly administered by the Greater London Council, and the City of London.
The catalogues of the major London history collections are being searched in turn, and the resulting references are entered on the Cardbox-Plus database.
They are allocated period and subject categories, enabling fast retrieval of information under various combinations of headings.
Certain categories of material (such as archaeology, and fiction about London) are excluded either because they are covered elsewhere, or from shortage of space.
Nevertheless, the total number of items is expected to be well over 20,000.
The database will continue to be updated after the publication of the bibliography in four volumes (including analytical index) in 1992.

A national collaborative project has recently been launched between the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, the University of Glasgow and the National Maritime Museum to prepare the definitive history of the British shipbuilding industry.
An important element is the development of a database recording all the 100,000 ships built over the last two centuries.
As well as making information available on each ship — such as tonnage, dimensions, shipbuilder, machinery, cost etc — the database can be interrogated to generate consistent statistics of the industry's output by period, region, ship type, machinery type etc.
A retired engineer who has collected information on card indexes over 30 years as a member of the World Ship Society is devoting his full time to implementing such a database.
For this he needs a computer at his home with a large storage capacity, and the ESRC project has been able to provide this.
As the database is developed it will be mounted at Newcastle, Glasgow and Greenwich to assist the shipbuilding research and statistical analysis.

The British banks have attracted criticism for a long time over their failure to provide long-term finance to industry, and to develop lasting relationships with industrial customers.
This failure, it is alleged, has hampered Britain's industrial development and contributed to the British economy's performance being poorer than it might have been.
The failure is said to have its origins in the second half of the nineteenth century when a number of changes were taking place in the structure of British domestic banking, and in the nature of corporate ownership.
Our project examines these allegations of failure.
We do this by a number of means, using hypotheses from economic and finance theory.
Our principal approach is to examine in detail the records of scores of banks operating in the period.
We collect published and unpublished balance sheet and other data for the majority of banks in the period.
The analysis of these data together with the use of hitherto unused qualitative information will provide the first detailed and accurate account of bank behaviour with respect to lending practice and thus allow a proper assessment of the central issues.

Even in a small economy like Scotland, little is known of the scale, structure and composition of the business community.
We do not know the number of firms in each major industrial sector, nor do we possess any systematic information on the origins and characteristics of Scottish businessmen.
The Project has three aims designed to improve our knowledge and understanding of the business community.
First, to identify the firms in each industrial sector and to rank the major companies at 25 year intervals between 1860 and 1960; second, to compile lists of owners, directors and managers in these leading firms in each sector; third, to produce a biography of enterprise in Scotland in the last century by preparing biographies of leading businessmen for publication in a Dictionary of Scottish Business Biography.
The Dictionary is organised in sectors, each set of biographies introduced by an essay outlining the development of the industry.
Volume 1 focuses on ‘The Staple Industries’, Volume 2 on ‘Processing Distribution and Services’: Volume 1 will be published in July 1986, Volume 2 in 1987.
The publisher is Aberdeen University Press.

In 1980 the Modern Records Centre published the first title in its Sources Booklet series, providing researchers with relevant references on the role of women in the working situation and in society generally from its extensive holdings of trade union, employers' organisation and interest group records and personal archives.
In the succeeding decade the Centre's holdings in most of these categories have increased considerably, in the process limiting the relevance of the first edition of ‘Women at work and in society’, which has, in the meantime, gone out of print.
This project aims to produce for publication by the University Library the text of a revised and enlarged ‘Sources Booklet’ on this theme, through research in the Centre's lists and indexes, examination of its holdings, especially uncatalogued accessions, and with the benefit of the knowledge of its holdings possessed by existing staff.

The research programme involves the completion of the development of a complex data base system for the computerised storage, handling and analysis of a large body of medieval and early modern merchants' account books.
This system, when finished, will permit the management of a large group of sources, allowing the extraction and manipulation of serial data relevant to the analysis of international transactions costs and market structures, as well as a structural analysis of the underlying patterns of merchant behaviour.

South East Asia has been an area of the most dramatic expansion of exports of primary products from the mid-nineteenth century: export expansion was the region's principal response to Western penetration.
The mid-nineteenth century saw the emergence in South East Asia of Asian capitalists who were initially subservient to Western interests, engaging in the expansion of primary exports and the distribution of imported Western manufactures.
Those capitalists, who were predominantly of Chinese and Indian extraction, gradually grew in size and economic importance, and in doing so moved increasingly away from their traditional roles in Western dominated export and import sectors, and towards manufacturing, banking and commercial expansion in their own right.
The links they established with Japanese traders and capital played an important part in this transformation.
This raises a number of central questions.
Did there emerge in the twentieth century a distinctive network of Asian capital, embracing Chinese, Indian and Japanese capitalists, distinct from the European network which had dominated South East Asia from the middle of the nineteenth century?
To what extent did the newly emerged Asian network shape the pattern of economic change in the twentieth century?
In the broadest terms, what were the relationships between European, intra-Asian and indigenous economic interests in South East Asia, and in what way did those relationships shape the emergence of modern capitalists in the region.
The principal concern of the research is to identify the Asian capitalist group in South East Asia, trace the changes in their composition and their expansion between 1890 and 1941, and evaluate their role and the importance of their trading and financial networks in the industrial development of the region.
Prominent groups — Wang Lee in Thailand, Tan Kah Kee in Singapore, Lee Kong Chian and M.Patel in Malaya, Oei Tiong Ham in Indonesia — will be used as case studies.
These groups were selected on the basis of their annual sales and total assets.
The project will focus on such issues as the business origins, form of economic activity, industrial strategy, links with foreign capital for each capitalist group.
Further, an examination of the impact of Japan's industrialization on the industrialization of twentieth century South East Asia will identify the importance of the Asian capitalist network in shaping the modern economic growth of the region, as well as some of the ‘missed opportunities’ which occurred under European rule from the middle of the nineteenth century: it must also be said that the penetration of Japanese manufactures into South East Asia had destructive as well as constructive implications for the South East Asian economies.

The project is linked to an earlier study of sexual misbehaviour in rural and small town Scotland.
It aimed at discovering whether levels of sexual activity outwith marriage and other forms of deviant sexual behaviour in the cities correspond to those already found elsewhere.
The topic lies within the recent interest in both urban history and popular attitudes to authority, particularly those of women.
Scottish cities, then as well as now, had very different social structures and economic functions one from another.
The material collected and used was, as in the earlier study, the record of parish discipline by the established church.
In Scotland such discipline continued for over a century after it had been abandoned in England, and spanned a period of exceptionally rapid economic development and social change.
The archive material has been found to be remarkably full, where it exists, but to have considerable gaps, so that only for short periods in particular cities can the levels of illegitimacy be assessed and compared with regional levels.
But the fullness of the material makes possible qualitative study with particularly interesting insights into popular opinions and activities.
The material has been labelled under over 120 headings, grouped into six larger themes, and papers are being prepared from it.
Two have already been accepted for publication.

The last two decades have seen a remarkable expansion in quantitative history relating to Ireland.
This welcome development would be aided, and significant economies in research time effected, if there was a databank of historical statistics readily available for historians and also historically-minded social scientists.
To meet this need, a massive computerised database of nineteenth and early twentieth century Irish historical statistics is being constructed.
When completed, this will be accessible, on line, to scholars in Britain, Ireland and continental Europe.
The major sources being used, and from which data are inputted, are: census materials, agricultural statistics, crime series, registrar general's reports, emigration reports.
The project is also incorporating existing machine-readable data files, relating to the nineteenth century, into its relational database.
When completed, the project will have brought into being a major research resource for the academic community.

In the half century before the First World War, investors residing in Scotland appear to have made an increasingly important contribution to Britain's position as the world's leading capital-exporting nation.
In the absence of concrete data, economic historians suggest that Scottish foreign lending rose from around 60 million in 1870 to around 500 million by 1914.
This project will provide new evidence relating to the nature of investment and the spread of ‘popular capitalism’ in pre-1914 Scotland.
It will also contribute to a continuing debate about the volume of UK capital exports and the effects on the domestic economy of high levels of foreign lending.
The research will involve construction of a database relating to limited-liability companies registered in Edinburgh for a range of foreign ventures including mining, plantations, railways and manufacturing.
Shareholding patterns in London-registered overseas companies will also be sampled, since it is apparent that Scots frequently purchased securities directly through this market.
Random samples of complete shareholder lists drawn from Edinburgh and London registered firms, as well as individual share portfolios drawn from Scottish probate inventories (for 1890 and 1914), will also be analysed in terms of geographical and occupational patterns of foreign investment.

The inventions and innovations of the British industrial revolution were spread to other nations by the transfer of technology.
France as a major political rival and industrial producer was particularly keen to obtain British technology from the early eighteenth century.
This inspired British legislation to prevent the emigration of skilled workers and (later) the export of machinery to other countries.
In turn this increased the importance of illicit means which involved industrial espionage, in the acquisition of new British technology by France.
The strength of the desire to gain particular techniques is often reflected by the extent to which industrial espionage was resorted to.
The survey examines the industrial espionage practiced by the French in England through the eighteenth century, almost invariably directed and organised by the French state, and the many important French administrators, technologists, scientists and industrialists involved.
The British industrialists and workers who passed France are investigated together with the skills and equipment involved.
The success of the operations is evaluated and many described in detail.
The extent to which the British legislation against the transfer of technology was implemented or effectual is analysed, together with the attitudes of British industrialists to the laws.

In previous research projects supported by the ESRC and other funding agencies, an inter-University group based in Birmingham has investigated many aspects of Soviet industrialisation, including quantitative developments, government policy and the economic structure.
The present project will complete the preparation of a summary volume on quantitative Soviet economic development, 1913-45.
The project investigators are editing the volume, and chapters are being written by Drs.
J.D. Barver (Cambridge, J.M. Cooper (Birmingham), P. Gatrell (Manchester), M. Harrison (Warwick), R.A. Lewis (Exeter) and J.N.
Westwood (Birmingham).
An initial draft of the main chapters was discussed at the World Congress on Soviet and East European Studies at Harrogate in July 1990.
Close attention will be paid to newly-available Soviet archival data on economic development.
Soviet economic history is now the subject if intense debate in the USSR.
The investigators have been able to discuss their work at seminars in the Soviet Union, and intend to visit Moscow in 1990/91 to discuss their work further.
They will also work in Soviet archives, where a great deal of new statistical data has become available.
During 1990/91 the inter-university seminar on Soviet industrialisation will continue to meet regularly five times a year in Birmingham, and work will continue on research associated with the present project, including unemployment in the 1920s, and the politics of industrialisation.

Small towns dominated the early modern landscape with England having as many as 600 small towns in the 18th century, playing a vital part in the economic and social life a major proportion of the population.
Until recently however very little systematic research has been undertaken in this country.
This is the third phase of a major project funded by the ESRC since 1985, examining the demographic, economic and social development of English small towns before and during the Industrial Revolution.
The project is building and extending large computerised collections of data on patterns of births and deaths and trades and occupations.
It is also now analysing for the first time in a quantitative way the changing social and cultural characteristics of small towns.
Correlating this material we will be able to answer key questions concerning the role of small centres in industrialisation and agrarian development, and the selection and socio-economic profiles of successful and declining towns.

Although the role of Western doctors in the introduction of Western medicine to China has been known about in a general sense for a long time, no studies exist which assess the contributions of British doctors in the last two centuries, yet evidence suggests that these were by no means insubstantial.
The research will seek to produce an exact and systematic account of the contribution of British born doctors to the development of Western medicine in China.
It will concentrate upon their role as change agents, and examine aspects of social and political structure in China and Britain.
In the former case the study will concentrate on factors which constrained or enhanced the development of Western medicine; in the latter case those which encouraged its export.
A particular additional focus will be the response of British doctors working in China to the theory and practice of Chinese traditional medicine.

Work on cultural change in Italy has traditionally placed emphasis on state provision and intervention as against the role of private cultural industries (the cinema, radio, publishing, and music businesses) and consumer demand.
The former have been seen, particularly in the Fascist period, as decisively shaping cultural policy.
Our project questions the validity of that approach and its underlying concepts and aims to see what kind of picture emerges when its emphasis is reversed.
We use a large body of new evidence to argue that previous work has underestimated or neglected
(1)
the complex interactions between cultural industries and various state agencies
(2)
continuities in the relations between cultural industries and pre- and post-war governments
(3)
the presence and meanings of non-national (especially American) products and styles
(4)
evidence about patterns of cultural consumption and demand.
Our research consequently combines a critical revision of the standard methodologies in the field with extensive new empirical work both on governmental-cultural industry relations and on patterns of consumption.
The latter is based in part on fieldwork involving in-depth interviews with 120 people in different parts of Italy.

Over the last two decades a great deal of work has been published by historians on the subject of popular culture.
Recently, the theoretical basis informing much of this work has come under scrutiny, particularly by those working in the field of social history of culture (for example, Roger Chartier) and indirectly, by those working in adjacent social sciences.
The conference brought together historians working in a variety of fields, including those of extra-European history, and including those coming from academic traditions different from the Anglo-American one (in particular the French), together with a number of colleagues from neighbouring disciplines.
Speakers were asked to address such questions as: the possibility of delineating a discrete and distinctive popular culture; the usefulness of conceiving culture as discourse or as an arena of social change; the forces which engender long-term changes in popular culture.
Eleven papers were given — which dealt with aspects of the history of popular culture from the 16th through to the 20th centuries in areas as diverse as early modern Germany, 19th century Russia and 20th century Mexico and India.

In recent years there has been growing concern about the effects of alcohol and discussion of the most effective forms of treatment response for excessive alcohol use.
Considerable changes in alcohol treatment policy have taken place, marked in particular by a shift from specialist to community care; an increased role for the voluntary sector and primary health care; and a change in definitions of alcoholism from theories of disease to concepts of problem alcohol use.
The overall shape of policy development is broadly clear, but the rationale and factors influencing change are less well understood.
This project aims to examine changes in alcohol treatment policy from the inception of the National Health Service to the 1980's.
The core questions of why policy developed in the way it did and which factors initiated and influenced change are intended to inform a critical assessment of the outcome of policy in the shape of service provision for alcohol problems in the 1990's.
Both documentary sources and interviews with key informants will be used; and the project will draw on perspectives from history, sociology and policy studies for conceptual analysis.

Macro-economic research in economic history depends to a large extent on the availability of annual series which can be used in models which test the growth path of the economy.
This may take the form of economic growth as a whole over long periods.
On the other hand it may test particular propositions about the fortunes of a particular sector, such as agriculture, or particular periods within a longer-run trend.
In agricultural history it is evident that a macro-economic overview is necessarily limited because we have no usable index of agricultural rent over any considerable period.
The project aims to rectify this omission for England over the period 1650-1914 by the construction of national rent index, and then to investigate two further problems: a regional breakdown of the index to see of there was a space-related differentiated land market; and secondly to focus attention on three periods of outstanding agricultural depression within the long run to see whether there was a time-related differentiation.
These three periods are the second quarter of the eighteenth century, the two decades after the Napoleonic Wars, and the so-called Great Depression of the late Victorian period.
The project will extract rental information from a sample of estate records which are available in the English county record offices, in private muniments, and in selected Oxbridge Colleges.
The database which will be produced will be made available through the ESRC Data Archive, and through publications.

By the 1690s, at the end of a long period of exceptionally rapid growth, London was by far the largest urban settlement in Europe, and poised to assume its later role as a metropolis.
This project aims to analyse the business and social composition of London at that crucial stage of its development, and so to make it a substantial contribution towards our understanding of the emergence of the modern British state and its economy.
From the records generated by the heavy taxation of the 1690s it is possible to characterize the householders of London, both in the city and outside, according to their places of residence, their occupations, the scale and character of their wealth, and the size of the their households.
There are some gaps in the surviving records, but for no earlier period, and for no later period before the nineteenth century, can the social fabric of the capital be charted in such a comprehensive way.
The project will also provide a crucial bench mark in London studies, and facilitate comparison between London and other European cities.
Among the published results, it is intended to produce a ‘social atlas of London in the 1690s’.

The project is designed to answer an important question: what evidence is there that British trade unions have seriously affected the ability of manufacturing industry to compete with other countries?
We are therefore concerned with the impact which trade unions and trade union membership has upon the productivity of the workforce.
The period chosen was a critical one for the British economy, emerging from the difficulties of the post-War period and embarking on a major period of expansion which saw the increase of real wages and affluence in British society.
It was also a period when British industries recorded lower levels of output than comparable sectors in other countries.
By the end of the 1960s British manufacturing was in serious difficulty.
This project looks at the records which could be used to assess the impact of unions on the shop floor of industry.
It is a preliminary investigation which will be followed by an application for a more substantial grant to collect empirical evidence on trade union behaviour in manufacturing.

The project will examine around 10,000 employees records from four different economic sectors (in banking, steel, railways and the postal services) between 1870 and 1940 in order to establish the changing patterns of career mobility for diverse categories of workers.
This will provide the first historical study of how groups of men and women in Britain experienced different types of career patterns in the course of their adult lives.
A major emphasis of the research will be the extent to which a recognisable ‘bureaucratic’ career developed in this period.
The project will seek to establish how and with what consequences more formal structures of employment were created.
Particular attention will be paid to systems of selecting, rewarding and promoting staff.
The researchers hope that such a perspective will throw fresh light on the interaction between work histories and recruitment, credentialism, gender, occupational and social mobility, class and the state in modern Britain.
This project builds on upon the existing expertise of the Keele Life Histories Centre in the interpretation of autobiographies, in the historical study of social mobility, and in the analysis of social class and gender dynamics of historical change.

Dr Davies and Professor Tomohei Chida of Aoyama Gakuin University have been working on differing aspects of the development of the Japanese ship-operating and ship-building industries for a number of years.
Following a visit to Japan made by Dr Davies in 1979, these separate studies have been merged into a collaborative effort.
This has been aimed at producing a joint-work which will attempt to describe and analyse the significant achievements of these twin sectors of the Japanese economy.
This will include references to the post-1868 period but the main body of the study will be concentrated on the years after the Second World War.
In the course of two previous research trips to Tokyo, Dr Davies has been able to examine many official archives at the Shipping Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, at the Japan Maritime Development Association and at the Japan Maritime Research Institute.
He was also greatly assisted by the co-operation of both the Shipbuilders Association of Japan and by the Japan Shipowners Association.
This examination of archives will continue during Dr Davies' current stay at the Faculty of Commerce, Hitotsubashi University, Tokyo.
His visit will also provide a valuable opportunity to consult with Professor Chida in respect of their book, The Growth of the Modern Japanese Shipping Industry, which is to be published by the Athlone Press of London in 1990.

Social history and, in particular, state provision of welfare, is a relatively neglected area in the historiography of the Weimar Republic.
The present study aims to fill an important gap, therefore, by analysing the genesis, development and eventual collapse of the social welfare system in Germany between 1918 and 1933.
The political and ideological imperatives behind the concept of public welfare will be examined, as will the nature and extent of legislation and other initiatives, with the central focus on those social groups who were, in theory at least, to be the principal beneficiaries: the industrial working-class in large urban areas, and previously ‘submerged’ groups, such as women and younger people.
Relevant spheres for scrutiny include health, education, employment, training, legal protection, trade unions, and others.
The broader political implications of the development of the ‘Sozialstaat’ are considered as a vital aspect of this matter.
The investigation is based on an extensive range of German archival material and secondary sources.

The aim of the project is to produce an annotated bibliography of material in Parliamentary papers relating to Scotland in the nineteenth century.
The resulting breviate will provide swift and informative access to information relating to Scottish affairs in ‘white papers’, ‘blue books’ etc…
The subject areas particularly emphasised will include legal history, local government industrial history, social conditions, housing, penal history, the history of Scottish institutions, local history, statistical data and the development of the Scottish education system.
The current project was preceded by a pilot study carried out in 1980-81, supported by the former SSRC.

With continued social unrest in Britain through the eighties and into the early nineties, it is clear that social protest, particularly with regard to the attitudes and responses of those in authority to collective violence, is back on the political agenda.
This will undoubtedly lead to comparisons with similar previous occurrences.
What is needed in making such comparisons is an approach which reintegrates social protest within its contextual base and seeks to fuse its ‘history from below’ with its ‘history from above’through a systematic and detailed examination of the widest range of sources available.
The research therefore sets out: 1) to examine the interrelationship of industrial and agrarian protest in the West of England, with particular regard to the changing fortunes of the textile and agricultural economies for the period 1750-1850; 2) to identify by systematic comparison over time and space within the region how community structures and politics shaped the form and incidence of protest within the wider context of community and industrial relations; 3) to examine the reaction and perception of both county and central government to disorder in different communities.

It is now realised that lesser landowners, or gentry, played a crucial role in all aspects of medieval English history from at least the mid-thirteenth century.
However, despite the growing interest in this field of study, there has been no examination of this social group right through the late-medieval period and many aspects of its history remain problematic, even barely explored.
These include such important matters as status and its relation to land, office-holding and military service; the structure and function of local networks; the degree of lawlessness.
Investigations of problems like these is time-consuming, as it has to be done by the accumulation and synthesis of quantities of very diverse information.
The present project aims to speed up the process at both the collection and analysis stages, by the development of software which will operate with speed, simplicity and flexibility, while the use of a portable computer will make it possible to enter material direct on to disc.
This software may well have wider implications for similar types of research.
The analysis itself will consist of a series of geographically and chronologically delimited case-studies, designed to cover a variety of periods between 1250 and 1500 and geographical areas.

Recent research on the process of industrialisation has led historians to place more emphasis upon the need for close study of family structures, forms of monetary income and the culture of artisans in explaining the distinctive features of particular regional and national industrial systems.
The aim of this study is to contribute to this inquiry by a comparative study of wage forms and work organisation in the trades of eighteenth-century France.
Wages in eighteenth-century France were paid in many different ways in different trades and localities.
As a result, the form of the wage provides a precise point of entry into a broader comparative examination of changes in the nature of work, the rhythms of production and the composition of the workforce over the course of time.
This, it is hoped, will make it possible to devise new ways of understanding ‘artisanal production,’ 'pre-industrial society' and the place of ‘popular culture’in the process of industrialisation.
The study is based mainly upon the records of the civil courts supplemented by such papers of corporate and administrative institutions as have survived.

The Institute of German, Austrian & Swiss Affairs hods an extremely large archive of newspaper cuttings (approximately half a million cuttings) relating to Germany, principally the GDR, during the years 1946-1981.
It was collected by the British Military Government in Berlin from German sources and covers all aspects of life in considerable detail, though the main emphasis is on political and economic affairs.
Although the material was systematically arranged as it was collected, the system changed very significantly at least three times, and by the time it arrived at the Institute in Nottingham, any order there had been in the files of material was lost.
The archive was thus virtually unusable since it was impossible to locate all the material on any given topic.
The purpose of the project is to transform this potentially extremely valuable research resource into one that is of actual benefit to scholars working in the field of German studies by making its contents accessible.
To this end, the material will be reorganised according to a single system and an index and guide will be created.
The reorganization is also a vital prerequisite before microfilming, which is urgently necessary for conservation purposes, can go ahead.

The hosiery industry was traditionally one consisting almost entirely of small family firms, but twenty years ago a few yarn suppliers and other major companies bought out large numbers of them.
Nevertheless, an important group of family firms retained their independence, and others have entered the industry since that time.
This situation allows a comparative study of the performance of small firms within much larger vertically integrated companies with the small firms that have retained their autonomy.
The long period (25 years) has been chosen to allow adequate perspectives and to take account of random fluctuations characteristic of the fashion industry.
The research is intended to cover both the quantitative, ie of changes in payroll, capital, turnover and other quantifiable variables on the one side, and the options and interpretations of leaders of the industry on the other.
A research assistant with several years experience in a family hosiery firm is being employed to help Dr Chapman with the project.

English probate procedures in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries created several different documents valuable to economic and social historians.
One of these is the probate account.
When someone died, the administrator collected all assets of the deceased and paid his outstanding debts.
He or she also settled expenses incurred since the deceased's death, such as the cost of the funeral.
The administrators was also responsible for maintaining the deceased's dependents.
Sums laid out by administrators ranged from hundreds of pounds spent repaying deceased's debts to a few pence spent mending children's shoes.
The administrator kept careful account of money laid out from the estate.
About 33,000 probate accounts survive in County Record Offices.
Most have been inaccessible to historians, because few record offices had adequate indexes.
This project aims to publish an index to all surviving accounts, with a substantial introduction discussing the nature and uses of probate accounts.
It also aims to create a computer database of the great variety of information contained in probate accounts.
This database will be held in the mainframe computer at Cambridge University, where it will be available to economic and social historians.

The aim of this project is to write an authoritative account of three episodes in British post-war economic history, and of the processes whereby decisions were taken and policies made in each case.
Each account will draw on the personal experiences of the principal investigator, who was closely and in several cases, centrally involved in all three episodes.
His own recollections will be supplemented by interviews and study of documents in the Public Record Office and elsewhere, conducted by himself and/or the second investigator.
Although it is obviously hoped that these accounts will be interesting as economic history, whatever they reveal about the working and role of government may also be relevant and applicable today.
The three episodes are
(1)
Economic Planning 1947-53
(2)
Devaluation of Sterling 1949
(3)
Rearmament for Korea 1950-51

Studies of the Miners' Strike have in general focused on their national political dimensions.
Local records of the strike have generally been confined to memorabilia.
The study aims to provide a systematic narrative of the strike and its aftermath, focused on a single village, and based on recorded interviews with local activists.
Over 50 villagers have been interviewed, generating 90 hours of tape and over 2700 pages of typed transcript.
Interviews focus on piecing together events in the village with a particular emphasis on problems of organisation, community support, the informal social security system, policing, strikebreaking, rumours, the formation and activity of a Women's Action Group, the impact of national events, community divisions, changes in social relations and the lasting effects of the strike.
The research shows the density and complexity of changes initiated by the stike and the sources and depth of community unity and division subsequent to it.
The course the strike followed in the village was of an initial passive consensus led by activists, which with the onset of local strikebreaking (Sept 1984) became transformed into an active consensus with widespread mobilisation.
This active consensus reached a peak at Christmas 1984.
In January and February 1985 it collapsed amidst tremendous local recriminations, directed primarily and almost entirely at strikebreakers.
The subsequent demoralisation in evidence throughout British coalfields has been mitigated to some degree in South Yorkshire by blame for defeat focusing on a clearly identifiable minority, who in response have developed a set of parallel social institutions.

The aim of this project is to use the Stockton and Darlington Railway as a means to highlight the nature of business enterprise in a regional context in Victorian Britain.
The company was the first public joint stock enterprise to employ steam traction and its records illustrate in detail how novel problems of management were overcome in a new sector of the economy and how entrepreneurs coped with severely fluctuating levels of profitability in response to the ebb and flow of investment expenditures after 1830.
Thus, as a case study in business history, the Stockton and Darlington Company provides important insights into the process of managerial decision-making in a period of economic history which has hitherto been under-researched at the level of the individual firm.
The project also assesses the contribution of the railway to economic growth in north-east England with particular reference to the mining and metallurgical industries of the Teesside region.

Research into the history of corporate finance during the period before 1914 has been limited by two major difficulties.
One is the dubious value of published accounts; the other is the questionable practice of extrapolating conclusions based on a single highly detailed case study to an entire industry.
The approaches employed in this research are designed to tackle these problems in order to produce substantive conclusions regarding the patterns and processes of corporate finance between 1860 and 1914.
The sample population consists of twenty major coalmining companies, many of which were also large producers of iron and steel, representing perhaps one quarter of UK coal output in 1913.
The project will involve translating surviving accounting data into a modern format and storage in a computer data base.
Supplemented by other archival sources, this will form a more reliable data set than any available hitherto, and will facilitate an examination of trends in, and connections between, sources of finance, profitability, investment and dividend policies, the impact of the trade cycle.
competition, and changes in ownership, control and management.
Both market-based measures and conventional accounting rates of return, widely used in other studies, will be considered.
In evaluating corporate performance an attempt will be made to link accounting rates of return to an internal rate of return.

The project investigates the seriously neglected history of employers' organisations and the role such associations played in the evolution of a system of industrial relations in the cotton industry between 1870-1939.
The focus of the research is the development of multi-employer labour management strategies.
It will be carried out within a comparative context, covering cotton spinning, weaving and finishing, the primary source materials being the extensive archives of textile employers' organisations in the North-West region of England.
The survey aims to quantify solidarity amongst employers and to analyse a number of themes:
(a)
the interrelationships between trade unions and employers' associations;
(b)
initiatives, motivations and implications of formalising collective bargaining;
(c)
the effects of product market trends and regional specialisms on employers' strategies;
(d)
the role of employers' organisations as regulators of wages and working conditions;
and,
(e)
the use of technology and scientific management by employers as mechanisms to control labour.

The port industry must be central to a study of industrial relations, particularly at the workplace level, in post-1945 Britain.
Dockworkers occupied a crucial place in the economic process, which they exploited to raise their earnings considerably above the average for manual workers.
The main features of the employment relationship in the major ports were broadly similar and created conditions which were favourable to the development of national trade union action of both official and unofficial kinds; but there were significant differences in the nature of industrial relations.
This project is examining the common features of, and trying to identify the differences between, the economic structures, work experience and union organisation in the Ports of London, Liverpool and Hull.
An important feature of the research is the programme of interviews with port workers, supervisors and dock labour employers.

Social historians tend to support the view that industrialisation destroyed the apprenticeship system.
This, combined with the shortage of labour in the United States, it is argued, led to the collapse of the system by the middle of the nineteenth century.
Yet, surprisingly little attention has been focused on the institution by historians.
A major problem in the past has been a shortage of adequate data.
One source of information lies buried deep within the voluminous papers of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia — at one time the largest locomotive plant in the world — located at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.
The papers, covering the period 1834-68, include copies of some 300 apprentices' indentures for the years 1856-68.
Each indenture records a mass of useful information: date of commencement of term; trade to be pursued; residence; length of training; whether completed or not; and the name of the parent or guardian.
Not only can the strength of the institution be gauged from this source, light can be cast on the social background of the apprentices through linking their parents to city directories (which list occupation).
The data collection has been completed and the material is, at the moment, being analysed.

There are several contenders for new classes of local and general analgesics (‘pain-killers') including the extraction of materials from novel organisms (such as Biopharm's work with leeches) and investigating the actions of the recently-discovered endogenous opioid substances (the body's own painkillers).
The likely economic and social impact of efficient classes of non-addictive drugs will be examined by looking at cocaine and its derivatives as a model case.
The history of cocaine's development will be reviewed.
The economic impact of the family of drugs that it generated will be charted to the present day (including development costs and profits by pharmaceutical companies).
In addition the changing patterns of employment of personnel involved in this area of drug company activity will be examined and an attempt will be made to weigh the medical benefits of the availability of cocaine and its derivatives against the problems caused by abuse of these agents.
It is intended that the review will be published to serve as a ‘case history’ for persons interested in the development of novel drugs so that economic decisions can have a stronger empirical base.
It may also serve as an additional stimulus to develop non-addictive pain-killers.

After an early phase of rapid growth initiated by enterprising, indigenous farmers and leading to an increasingly capitalist social structure, by 1939 the Ghanaian cocoa industry had entered what has been generally a long decline accompanied by reduced employment of wage-labour.
This project is a case-study of south Ashanti, and investigates the causes of the decline and the apparent weakening of capitalist social organisation in the industry.
These issues are important for the future of Ghana and other African agricultural exporters, and are of theoretical interest to historians and social scientists concerned with the problematic ability of indigenous capitalism to lead economic development in the Third World.
Existing literature on the subject is relatively small, and where a historical perspective is adopted, it is constrained by reliance on an overly narrow range of sources, and avoidance of a grass-roots perspective.
To remedy this, the research carries out a district level approach, which will permit use of a wide range of oral and written sources.

This project investigates how the police maintained order and enforced the law when the two came into conflict during industrial disputes between 1906, after the passing of the Trades Disputes Act which legalised peaceful picketing, and the end of the General Strike in 1926.
The research is focused on which factors helped to contain, and which exacerbated violence during police/striker confrontations.
The research looks at major strikes in selected areas of Great Britain, and the focus throughout is on the police and on what determines their behaviour.
To this end, an assessment will be made of the influence of local economic and political interests, of central government directives, of the outlook and response of Chief Constables and of the interpretation and discretionary enforcement of orders by rank and file police officers.

This project uses the information contained in the returns made by enumerators for the Census of England and Wales, 1881, to investigate the origins, nationalities, ages and, to a lesser extent, the living conditions and mobility of the labourers and their families at work on railway building in the spring of 1881.
The methodology and techniques already employed in the production of the study entitled ‘Railway Construction Labour in England in the Returns for the Censuses of 1841-71’(HR 3417) are again being used in this project.
Thus information on groups of workers obtained from the Public Record Office, Portugal Street, London, is being analysed and tabulated in order to produce data in a concise form on age structure, places of origin, etc.
Conclusions will then be drawn from this body of facts and these will be presented in narrative form.

Religious divisions have polarised the west of Scotland along lines recognisable to anyone familiar with the contours of the Northern Ireland conflict.
Glasgow, where one-third of the population is of Roman Catholic and Irish extraction, has often been depicted as a mini-theatre of conflict.
This project monitors relations between the host community and Irish immigrants and their descendants from 1918 to the present and examines why community divisions failed to reach critical proportions, although many of the ingredients of the Northern Ireland conflict were present on Clydeside.
The key factors encouraging gradual absorption and then integration are being identified, while the failure of sectarianism to be completely eradicated looms large in the investigation.
Community relations are being closely monitored for the 1930s and the last fifteen years of the Northern Ireland conflict and a comparison is being made with Liverpool which shared many of Glasgow's communal tensions to an even more marked degree.
The research is based in large part on newspaper records, interviews, and a study of Home Office records and those of political parties, trade-unions and the churches.

This investigation should make it possible to judge whether or not recent changes in the household position of elderly persons has meant a break with arrangements traditional in our country for many centuries.
Present indications go to show that this is not the case but it is of extreme importance that this hypothesis should be tested.
With this information, British scholars will have in their possession details on the size, structure, composition and affective quality of household relationships since the later Middle Ages.
This will be by far the longest record for any society, a record which now breaks off in the 1880s.

The prevailing viewpoint on the history of childhood is that, prior to the eighteenth century, there was no concept of childhood and little intimacy between parent and child.
Discipline was strict, often brutal.
However, a closer examination of the argument and the evidence used to support it reveals grave defects.
Many 17th century sources, contradicting the above-mentioned depressing picture, have already been studied.
The aim of the investigation is to analyse the remaining personal documents on 17th century childhood in Britain.
The findings will be set in a temporal and continental framework — material from earlier and later time periods and also from French and German sources will be used for comparison purposes.
It is hoped to find sufficient evidence to reconstruct the life-style of the early modern child.
Personal papers, diaries and autobiographies are exceedingly valuable for bringing to light how past parents coped with the difficult task of rearing their children.
Unfortunately, there are many methodological problems to contend with in the analysis of such documents.
Thus one of the main considerations of the research will be to make some contribution to the task of developing a more sophisticated literary sociology.

This research project covers the standard of living and aspects of social and economic change in the agricultural and artisan sectors of northern England, between 1660 and 1870.
Using mainly poor law and settlement records which provide biographical information on members of the labour force, the aim is to assess the effects of industrialisation on long-term trends in agricultural real wages and familial income, and on sexual divisions of labour in agriculture and the trades.
Attention will also be paid to changes in seasonal and yearly unemployment, the decline of traditional apprenticeship, changes in employment and hiring practices affecting the position of young people, labour mobility and supply, the operation of the old and new poor laws, and demographic and social changes in the family during this period.
The intention is to assemble data on rural social and economic change in the industrialising north which will complement the work now completed by this author on the more strictly agricultural counties in the south of England and Wales, making clearer the very different social and economic developments in the north and south between 1660 and 1870.

The period investigated is one of increased interest in political and academic circles in the implications of the decisive shift in the British age structure, towards a higher proportion of older people, which had been taking place since the beginning of the century.
This generated a considerable amount of published research, and speculation, about the implications of this shift for the economy (in terms of labour resources and demand for goods and services) for society (in terms of household structure, for example, and for relationships within households) and for the political system.
The discussion generated further research, for example into the work capabilities of those past middle age.
Most of this material has not previously been surveyed.
It contains data and ideas highly relevant to current discussion of the implications of societal ageing.
It also contributed to the construction of the contemporary image of the elderly — a process this research is concerned to analyse.
The immediate post war period was also when the practice of retirement at around age 65 became almost universal among manual workers.
This project explores how this change came about, using contemporary surveys, in the broad context of studying older workers in the post war period of labour shortage and industrial restructuring.
It is also the period when poverty in old age was identified as a major social problem and much surveyed; and when geriatric medicine first became firmly established.
These aspects of the changing experience of the elderly will be surveyed, using primarily documentary sources, in order to reconstruct the experiences of an age group and attitudes to them in a period of significant social change.
Ageing research
The Panel on Ageing arose as a result of the suggestion of the 1981 Working Group on Priority Areas for Research.
Three areas of research were suggested:
(1)
The political economy of ageing;
(2)
Internal differentiation in the life styles of the elderly population;
(3)
Attitudes and expectations in life transitions which are closely associated with chronological age.
In particular, the research should seek to develop theories about the process of ageing and particularly about the management of age-related transition such as exists from the labour market.
Following the work of the Panel, the Social Affairs Committee appointed a consultant Professor Margot Jeffreys to define areas of research on the process of ageing with special emphasis on the mature adult worker in the age group 45 to 65.
The particular forms of the study are on the transition to old age and the process of ageing.
Included in the programme are the effects of redundancy and the older worker.
Total cost of programme: phase 1, 1/10/84-31/12/87, £277000; phase 2, 1/10/88-31/9/92, £700000

This project investigates the effects of the changing class structure on the production of culture.
In a study of Manchester and the West Riding, the nature and composition of the ‘new middle class’ of industrialists, manufacturers, and bankers is being examined, and the growth of a specifically urban middle class culture investigated.
A major focus is on the involvement of the middle classes in the visual arts, both directly, through patronage, and indirectly, in their role in particular cultural institutions.
These influences and practices are being related to the nature and ideology of pre-Victorian and Victorian painting.
A central theme is the role (or absence) of women, both in urban public life and in artistic production; the representation of gender and sexuality in nineteenth-century paintings is being related to these socio-historical factors.

In spite of the major growth of historical interest in the European city in recent years, very little is still known about the hundreds of small towns which served as the main contact point between urban and rural society before the 19th century.
Small towns (population less than 5,000 in 1801) played a vital role in provincial Britain and France as marketing, craft and service centres.
This research (in collaboration with Professor J-P Poussou, Universities of Bordeaux III and Paris Sorbonne, under the Franco-British Programme) aims to identify the differing demographic and economic experience of small towns in France and Britain 1600-1850 and to answer key questions concerning why certain small towns developed as major industrial centres during the period, and why others became economic backwaters.
The research also examines how far changes in urban society and the urban network contributed to the general process of modernisation in the two countries.
The principal method of investigation is a survey of demographic and economic trends from parish register and occupational evidence, using samples of small towns in Britain and France.

Average height achieved at a given age is a sensitive measure of the nutritional status of a population.
It reflects both the nutritional inputs to the human body and the demands put upon the body (before adult height is achieved) by growth, disease, work effort and other features of the environment.
This research completes the analysis of a large quantity of data, collected under a previous ESRC grant, relating to the height, age, occupation and place of birth and residence of approximately 250,000 males born in Britain between 1730 and 1880 and relates it to other historical and contemporary data on height and its correlates.
Initial research has shown substantial variation in the mean heights of the British population over time and in cross-section — for example between different social classes and different areas of the country and this variation is described and explained.
The research is being carried out in collaboration with researchers in the United States and considerable attention is being paid to national differences in heights and their implications for welfare and productivity.

Of late, increasing attention has been paid to the role of women in pre-industrial society.
This interest owes much to the recent establishment that population growth in the past was particularly responsive to changes in the age at which women married and in the level of female celibacy.
As these variables were, in turn, closely linked with economic change, it is clear that historians need to look critically at the position of women within the household and the labour market.
In the present study, these issues are examined by focusing on women in a selection of towns of different sizes and specialisations.
It is intended to exploit a relatively unknown type of early population listing, which provides evidence concerning the composition of the household and the mobility of the population over time.
These data will then be supplemented with material from sources in order to examine the movements of and employment opportunities available to women at different stages in the life-cycle.
Whilst concentrating on urban women, the research considers the many links between town and countryside, for towns acted both as stimulants of population growth and as important marriage and employment ‘markets’ for their hinterlands.

The English poll tax returns of 1377, 1379 and 1381 have left a wealth of documentation, mainly in the form of indentures recording the number of 1377 tax-payers by vill and detailed rolls for 1379 and 1381 listing the names, assessments and often the occupational details and relationships of the tax-payers.
In the first year of this project, it is planned to prepare a machine-readable version of all the detailed tax indentures and rolls for subsequent analysis using the data retrieval system known as Personal Data System on the University of Oxford ICL 2988 computer.
In the second year, the research will utilise these data first to identify their biases, such as the possible under-recording of women and servants.
It will then proceed to investigate marriage patterns with particular emphasis on differences between occupational groups and persons resident in town and country.
It will hopefully provide firmer evidence than assembled hitherto on whether medieval England already had the highly distinctive pattern of late female marriage and high proportions never-marrying that is known to have been firmly established in sixteenth century evidence contained in the parish registers.

The research project focuses on an unexplored and crucial theme in the history of the contact between Europe and Asia.
Two features common to the patterns of social and cultural change in all parts of Asia and Africa are a movement towards modern ways of life and adoption of western ideas and practices.
These tendencies are largely determined by what a particular non-European society perceives as western civilisation and how they react to it.
A study of these perceptions and attitudes thus provides the clue to the understanding of significant tendencies in the countries of the Third World.
Bengal was the first region in the Indian sub-continent to come under the British rule, and the Bengali middle class the first among the Asian intelligentsias to respond to the western presence.
Thus the Bengali perceptions of the west in the 19th century — studied from the view-point of contact between dissimilar cultures and the attitudes characteristic of elite groups in a colonial society — has a relevance to the analysis of much wider issues.
In this project, the subject is studied on the basis of literary sources, periodicals, biographical material, private papers, visual arts and ephemera.
The perceptions and attitudes are being analysed at various levels ranging from intellectual appreciation to popular stereotypes.

The damage and deprivation of the Second World War provided a major stimulus in Britain to the establishment of comprehensive urban planning instruments and created a social and physical environment prepared to accept radical planning ideology.
However, post-war reconstruction is a relatively neglected episode in British history.
This research project aims, therefore, to redress this imbalance with an analysis of the problems, the processes, and the results of the reconstruction of war-damaged British towns and cities in the decade 1945-1955.
The inquiry examines central government policy, local government policy and implementation, the planning climate, and the expectations of the British public.
Six local case studies have been selected: Birmingham, Canterbury, Coventry, London, Plymouth, and Sheffield.
The results will be set in the context of a study of the history of planning theory and urban policy making.
In addition, the association of the research with a parallel project on French reconstruction undertaken by the Institut d'Histoire du Temps Pr'esent will allow international comparative analysis in both planning studies and the history of society.

There has been no serious study made of the overall sociological, economic and political situation of German youth during the Third Reich, and the present investigation is designed to fill an important gap in the historiography of National Socialism in general, and in the social history of Nazi Germany in particular .
The aim is to undertake a fundamental and comprehensive analysis of the most significant factors affecting the everyday reality of German youth, especially working-class youth, during the 1930's: included are employment and unemployment patterns, income levels, social status, family and educational backgrounds, welfare provision, juvenile criminality, perception of parents, school and church authorities and of National Socialism, and levels of political consciousness.
Thus, for example, the Nazi concept of an egalitarian community, which implied a thoroughgoing social revolution, can be stringently tested on the basis of extensive empirical material.
The evidence will be placed in a conceptual framework, that is informed by current theories of socialisation, modernisation, and ideas relating to the social dynamics of totalitarianism.

The primary focus of research is on the records generated by the enforcement in the late fourteenth century of the labour laws, the earliest attempt at national wage regulation.
In the course of dealing with those who demanded excessively high wages or who broke their contracts, the courts provided us with a great deal of evidence about wage rates, and continuity and frequency of employment.
This is being used to increase our understanding of real earnings, with special emphasis on regional variations, and the geographical and occupational mobility of wage earners.
It is possible to identify many individual wage earners in the court records, and the next stage of the project involves finding out more from other sources about these individuals, so as to understand more fully their social and economic position, and especially the extent to which they were solely reliant on their income from wage earning.

The present research project is part of a long-term study of Soviet economic and social history in the inter-war period and it relies heavily on the work carried out in earlier projects.
The years 1926-41 were a period of an unprecedentedly rapid rate of industrialisation and modernisation; but this involved a severe disruption of part of the economy, particularly in the early 1930s, when a major dislocation in the market for food and consumer goods resulted in famine in important areas.
The object of this study is to consider in detail the sources of capital investment that facilitated such a rapid rate of industrialisation, and the consequences of these patterns of investment in the different branches and sectors of the economy.
Particular attention is also being paid to the transfer of resources between agriculture and the non-agricultural branches, to the changes in the incomes and expenditure of the different groups in Soviet society (including the very important state sector), and to the distribution of labour between these different sectors and branches.
The study uses many previously unavailable materials.
The project will continue to serve as a centre for other scholars working in this field.

The purpose of the project is to compile a handbook to government records on economic planning in Britain between 1943 and 1951 so that future research in this area will be more efficient and cost-effective.
The handbook will include an introduction to the broad economic and administrative history of the period and then a summary of the contents of specific classes of records, in particular those of the Cabinet Office, HM Treasury and the Board of Trade.
The introduction will be designed to alert research workers to the wide range of departmental records relevant to the planning and implementation of economic policy and to the tensions between economic theory and ‘real-world’ pressures.
The summary of the files will define the major policy debates and decisions, highlighting the contribution of economists within government.
The completed work will be published by HMSO as part of the Public Record Office's series of official handbooks.

The project aims to identify the origins, development and changes in the concept of maladjustment in relation to the provision of child guidance services by the State.
It is a history of social policy which looks at the birth of a new idea and its institutional location.
The new idea —‘the maladjusted child’— described a child who had social or emotional inhibitions which blocked ‘normal development’.
It first reached legislation in the 1944 Education Act which made maladjustment one of the special educational needs for which local education authorities had to provide.
Was Cyril Burt as responsible for the development as he claimed or does it derive more from distinct European or American traditions?
The research traces the idea's formation in the 1920s; the slow growth in individual educational psychology in the 1920s (associated with, but different from, group psychometrics); the establishment of the current system of clinics and professional regulation of the 1940s and 1950s.
It is not a history of diagnosis or treatment but of policies and institutions and their relationship to theories of the child mind.
It looks closely at the range of policies developed by local government and in so doing assesses the relative responsibilities of various professional and political groups for their initiation and enactment.

Over the past ten years, work has been conducted at the University of Edinburgh aimed at producing a large national sample from the enumeration returns from the 1851 Census of Great Britain.
The principal objective has been to provide a data resource for research on a wide range of aspects of 19th century society.
An important offshoot has been the development of a teaching tool which is now in use at all educational levels from primary schools to Universities.
The complete data set consists of returns for some 400,000 individuals.
The data base now exists in several forms.
One is a complete, computer-readable transcription from which extracts can be listed in a format similar to the original source so as to allow manual analysis.
In a second form of the data, the transcript is ‘enriched’ by incorporating extra background information on the place sampled, and is standardised by computer coding into a form suitable for a large scale quantitative analysis.
In this form, the data are now available through the ESRC Data Archive in a highly portable format which allows them to be processed on any computer system anywhere in the world.
The present data format, however, restricts inquiries to a level at which the unit of analysis is the individual.
Software will now be developed for the distribution of data in which individual, family, household and community level data can all be examined and in which relationships between levels can be analysed.
Data in this new form will then be processed for distribution.

For the period before the Industrial Revolution little is known about the operation of local labour markets, especially for the north of England.
Further knowledge is necessary if historians are to learn more about the standard of living of ordinary workers.
The research aims to provide detailed evidence of the working lives of building workers in five north eastern towns — Beverley, Durham, Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne and York.
The investigation will include a consideration of the regularity of work, methods and levels of payment, the provision of food and drink at work, seasonal fluctuations in employment, and many other aspects of the work experience.
Whenever possible, information will be collected from more than one source, eg from both town council and church accounts, to try to discover if a single labour market operated in a town.
The chief method of investigation is to be the collection of material from the various archive collections of the regions.

This project examines the nature and the scope of the records held at the Westminster Abbey Library that relate to the early modern period ie 1550-1750.
In the early part of this century a calendar of the Abbey muniments was produced.
This consists of slips of paper describing nearly 70,000 individual documents.
Unfortunately the slips are not arranged in a chronological order and documents relating to the early modern period are scattered throughout the calendar.
The index to the calendar is useful for those who are working on local and genealogical history, but it provides little help to those who are interested in topics of wider historical significance.
Therefore, an essential preliminary to serious work on the Abbey archives is the compilation of a separate index of records at the Abbey that relate to the early modern period.
The nature of the research that the completed index will make possible is as yet uncertain.
But since the Dean and the Chapter of Westminster administered an extensive nationwide estate, their records will reveal many economic and social changes taking place in the early modern period.

The object of this project is to gather extensive material from Dutch archives on the largely unstudied aspects of Dutch government initiatives to defend and promote Dutch economic primacy in Europe and the wider world in the period 1650-1713.
This was a time of growing conflict and rivalry between the Dutch Republic, England and France for mastery of international commerce and all three used the power of the state, through a wide range of mercantilist measures, to influence the outcome.
Contrary to what is often supposed, the Dutch were scarcely less prone to employ political means to promote their economic position than was the France of Louis XIV and Colbert.
To counter the new industrial strategy, colonial initiatives, and tariff manipulation of France and England, the Dutch strove — with some success — to restrict the flow of French and English products to markets they controlled, such as the Baltic, dealing considerable damage in particular to French trade and industry.
At the same time, using retaliatory import tariffs and other protective measures, the Dutch government was able to give something of a boost to a number of Dutch industries which had previously been weak or languishing.
The most notable of these were the silk, paper, sail canvas, and gin distilling industries.
For the time being, the Dutch succeeded in retaining first place in Asian and African trade and were able to retain what was perhaps the largest share in the transit traffic to Spanish America.
However, the Dutch position was largely undermined by the French and English in the Mediterranean and throughout the Near East and also in many parts of the Caribbean.

If class is the English obsession, then in fact surprisingly little systematic attention has been paid to the terms in which workers and others have perceived the social order in which they lived.
This research explores the discourses of class in terms of the meanings clustering around the ideas of work and of community.
It considers the ways in which an older, customary way of representing the social order was transformed in the process of urbanisation and industrialisation.
The history of the English language is considered, especially in its regional and dialect forms.
Using a broadly anthropological approach to work, discourses generated within and beyond the workplace are examined.
Contrasting work ethics and changing social estimations of work and leisure are traced.
The meanings of ‘community’ are considered in relation to the representation of social types of groups, and of the town, region, and nation.
A study of transformations in modes of communal, customary activity is complemented by attention to the ways in which senses of the past were historically constructed.
The research will compare Lancashire, West Yorkshire, and London.
Among a wide range of sources, popular literature, the press, and trade union records will be used.

Edinburgh is Scotland's capital, and, until overtaken by Glasgow in the middle of the eighteenth century, was its largest and most important city.
Exerting a strong influence on all areas of commercial, financial, social and cultural life during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Edinburgh was the focus for many of the changes which transformed Scotland from an economically backward country into a pioneer industrial nation.
This study examines the nature of social and economic change within Edinburgh in this crucial period and relates it to wider developments in Scotland as a whole.
Particular attention is given to the provision of financial services for industrial development and agrarian improvement; the extent of movement into and out of Edinburgh; the social structure and occupational zoning within Edinburgh; demographic change; the role of the law and of secular and ecclesiastical institutions in helping or hindering change; the nature of social relationships within the town and the extent to which new and more progressive values existed in the city.

Very little is known about wages and prices or the standard of living before the Industrial Revolution: this project aims to explore some of this ground by the systematic collection of data from estate records, tax rolls, JPs' records, merchants' papers and other sources.
Was Scotland better off than contemporary Ireland?
How much of the wage was normally paid in kind rather than cash?
Did wages before industrialization vary much from year to year, or was an unvarying ‘customary’ wage more usual?
What was the precise impact of wars and shortages on the cost of living?
Did animal prices rise dramatically after the Act of Union?
How much did prices and wages vary between different parts of Scotland, Highland and Lowland, rural and burgh?
Is it possible to construct long-run indices of wages and prices to parallel those constructed for England by Beveridge and others?
A proper understanding of the way the ordinary Scot lived in the past, and of the main forces affecting his standard of living, can only be achieved by careful investigation along these lines.
An investigation into food and wages paid in food was added, which also involved studies of animal size.

The purpose of this project is to make an updating of an annotated bibliography of 205 publications whose authors made substantial use of the manuscript census enumerators' books of the period 1841-1881.
The bibliography is being accessed to the Cambridge computer by staff at the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure.
This will make it possible, for a modest fee, to provide researchers with up-to-date print-outs indicating the scope of each item, methods of analysis used and relationships tested.
Topic print-outs will be available on the following subjects: methodology, demography, families, households, occupations, social structure, migration, residential segregation.
Print-outs by region or country will also be available.
The investigators wish to facilitate comparative work, which is lacking in this field of study, and to encourage the writing of books and articles with a wider readership than is currently usual.

The Group researches into the dynamics of long-term population change, paying particular attention to its reciprocal relationship with economic development, and studies the origins and consequences of changes in the structure of the household and the family in both the recent and the more distant past.
Programme 1 English historical demography
A Long-term population change
Investigators: R Schofield, E A Wrigley, J E Oeppen
The results of earlier research reported in Wrigley and Schofield, The Population History of England have continued to attract attention in the periodical literature.
Further work, building on these results, was published in a special issue of the Journal of Interdisciplinary History (spring 1985), edited by Wrigley and Schofield.
Research has continued on nuptiality, specifically on the relative importance of changes in fertility in the past and of change in the age of marriage and in the proportions marrying.
A paper on this issue by Schofield was published in the Journal of Family History (spring 1985).
Oeppen has continued to investigate the structure of projection models as applied to long runs of data from the past.
He has been able to formulate a general model which encompasses existing models and enables tests to be made of the robustness of the results reported in The Population History of England by varying the projection parameters.
A presentation of the general model, and a report of the outcomes of the tests are being prepared for publication.
B Family reconstitution
Investigators: R Schofield, E A Wrigley, R Davies
Family reconstitution is a technique which enables detailed calculations to be made of fine measures of demographic behaviour to complement the main outlines of population trends revealed by the Group's earlier research.
Sufficient data stretching back to the mid-sixteenth century have now been assembled to make it possible for the first time to study short-term as well as long-term characteristics of demographic behaviour at the micro level.
Programme 2 Social structural history
A Patterns of residence and household composition
Investigators: R Wall, K Schurer, J Robin
Investigations into family and household structure have centered around CAMTAB, a set of computer programs written to generate 85 standard tables detailing a range of population and household characteristics.
Current research is focused on the examination of changes in household structure, with particular attention to the residential position of the elderly, within thirteen contrasting communities in England and Wales in the late nineteenth century.
A study of prenuptial pregnancy and illegitimacy in a mid-nineteenth century Devon community has revealed the existence of an inter-related set of households constituting a permissive ‘sub-society’.
An analysis of individual life-histories illuminates the nature of community control over members of the ‘sub-society’.
B Microsimulation of kinship and household structure
Investigator: P Laslett, with J E Smith visiting
This activity, along with the History of Ageing (see C below) is being undertaken at the Group by the Rank Xerox Unit of ageing.
Kin sets have been simulated for a number of demographic regimes, including several in English history and those which would come about in China as that country approached a one child per family fertility level.
Interchanges are being arranged with the Chinese and with a group in Paris also pursuing microsimulation.
Recent work has involved the incorporation of divorce and remarriage in the simulation routines, and on implementation of the latter for micro-computers.
C History of ageing
Investigators: P Laslett, D Thomson
The following topics are being pursued: transfer incomes to the elderly, contrasting the level of support under the Poor Law and the Welfare State; retirement and the employment of elderly persons in pre-industrial times and up to the present.
Programme 3 History of living standards
A Living standards in London, 1500-1700
Investigator: J Boulton
The aim of this new project is to relate wages and prices to a series of model household budgets designed to reflect changes in patterns of consumption and expenditure.
The project will also examine the methodological problems associated with using institutional records as sources for wage and price data.
Related Activities
The Group affords advice and facilities for researchers in population and social structural history.
It provides technical advice and computing facilities, printed and photocopied research material, a specialised library, a seminar programme which attracts attendance from outside Cambridge as well as within, and plays a major role in sustaining the publication of Local Population Studies.
Through this journal, members of the Group are actively involved in disseminating information concerning the analysis of census documents.
The Group is also responsible for the English section of the Annual International Bibliography of Publications in Historical Demography published by the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population.
A major development in 1986 has been the launch of Continuity and Change, a new social history journal published by the Cambridge University Press.

Since the Second World War there have been many changes in official policies toward, and social assumptions concerning, the control and treatment of crime and offenders.
While a number of useful studies have been made of changes in particular fields, there has been no detailed and comprehensive review of all the changing assumptions, policies and practices of the last 40 years.
Such general reviews as have been attempted have not considered all the evidence available.
The present study is intended as a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the many ways in which the criminal justice system of England and Wales has changed since 1945.
It is also intended to illumine current policy options by reference to the largely unreviewed experiences of the recent past.
The methods employed are those familiar to historians and political analysts, being based principally on key printed and manuscript sources of the period.
The latter includes evidence available both from the Public Record Office (to 1955) and, by courtesy of the Home Office, relevant documents in the Home Office.

This project focuses on six localities chosen to offer contrasting experiences of economic change.
Kirkcaldy is an area which has experienced both the decline of its traditional industries of coal mining and linoleum (and in an earlier period textiles) and the advent of new employment opportunities in electronics, light engineering and services.
The Research Development as a whole is concerned with four major topics: the policies employers adopt towards the labour force; the attitudes of workers to employment and the labour market; changes in the household and their relationship to both paid and unpaid work; and the impact of economic change on social integration and social stratification.
These topics will be examined largely by the use of three surveys, one of employers, one on work and employment, and one on family and household.
The Kirkcaldy study is distinctive in two respects.
First in the attention it will pay to historical processes and secondly in a focus on the relationship between work and the household.
The historical emphasis is on the way in which the present labour market in Kirkcaldy and the behaviour and attitudes of employers and labour force are shaped by historical forces.
The second specialised study aims to show how labour market experience affects and is affected by social relations within the household.
These two studies will employ documentary, intensive interview and oral history techniques.
A further area of interest is that of household work a

In recent years there has been considerable discussion of the extent to which university research addresses industrial needs.
More particularly, the Finniston Report in 1980 drew attention to the heavy emphasis on manufacturing in German engineering curricula in contrast with the relatively ‘academic’ orientation of British engineering education.
The aim of this research is to establish in precisely which respects this characterisation may be true and then to explain why such a pattern has emerged.
Initially a survey will be made of the engineering curricula and research in a range of British university departments, past and present.
Variations in types of curricula and research (eg industrially-relevant versus ‘academic’) will then be traced, wherever possible, to the organisational setting of the departments.
For example:
(1)
Which interest groups were influential in getting an engineering speciality established in a particular university?
Did employers shape the curriculum?
(2)
From what career backgrounds are academic engineers recruited?
Do such backgrounds help to explain variations in curriculum or research?
(3)
What formal and informal channels have existed between academic engineers and ‘the outside world’, and how consequential have these contacts been?
Have such ties changed over time?
The research fellow will use university archival material as well as interviews with both active and retired academic engineers.

This research aims to uncover the special role of refugee migrations, ‘brain drains’ and international movements of personnel generally in scientific growth, particularly as regards the development of new scientific specialities and disciplines such as theoretical physics, applied mathematics, bio-physics and molecular biology.
The aim is to develop a range of policies to develop the positive aspects of this process for scientific growth in potential host countries such as the UK; and also to minimise the deleterious effects of negative aspects such as those bound up with the current ‘brain drain'.
To the extent that a scientific speciality or discipline is bound together by the rules of an existing ‘paradigm’ defining the rules for ‘puzzle-solving’with an existing ‘normal science’, it has been argued that major scientific change often comes from outside the existing specialist group — not untypically through the ‘migration’into the group of innovative outsiders.
In the case where the innovative outsiders are also internationally renowned practitioners in their own right, perhaps displaced by political upheavals, it may be that they are particularly well qualified to synthesise the approaches of their native and host cultures, and overcome resistance to new scientific innovation.
This project is part of the Science policy initiative (award reference YA/33/25/0046)

Most manual workers in Britain receive a weekly wage which is determined by how many hours they work, how much they produce, or some combination of the two.
This system of weekly payment is still much more prevalent in Britain than in other advanced European countries, and it is so for historical reasons.
The aim of this research is to investigate the historical commitment of both managements and workers to this system despite a large number of attempts before the second world war to adopt alternative reward structures in industry.
Among the alternatives attempted were profit-sharing schemes, co-partnership projects, premium-bonus and other related incentive systems, broadly based scientific management, and worker co-operation.
Many of these schemes provide greater economic incentives for both workers and managers than the prevailing remuneration systems, yet they achieved little long-term success.
By using individual company case-studies and macro-economic evidence, this research will provide some answers to the questions of why these alternatives failed, and whether productivity could have been raised by a general adoption of different incentive and reward structures in industry.

The economic history of Byzantium has in the past been examined too much in isolation from the general course of medieval economic history.
Historians have suggested that Byzantium followed a different path from Western Europe with economic decline starting in the eleventh century.
The project will re-examine this perspective, using a wide variety of source material to analyse population movements, agricultural production, the pattern of monetary circulation and commercial contacts between town and country to show that traditional views on the subject need revision.
The conclusions of this work affect interpretations of the general course of Byzantine history.
Economic decline has been presented as one of the causes of the weakening of the power of the state bureaucracy and its loss of control over its powerful provincial magnates.
An attempt is made to demonstrate that this reasoning is faulty and that the disintegration of the Byzantine state was accompanied by economic growth in the provinces which reinforced the power of the provincial aristocracy in relation to the state.

Anne Lister was for the last fourteen years of her life the owner and occupant of Shibden Hall in Halifax.
This fifteenth century house, now the Folk Museum of West Yorkshire, was the centre of a thriving estate which contained agricultural and urban tenants, coal workings and urban property as well as a home farm and extensive gardens.
Miss Lister administered it herself, and during her life there continued the practice she had begun in 1817 of keeping a daily journal.
This journal fills 24 volumes--6,000 pages, much of it in code.
But within these pages is a unique record of the life of an independent woman, an administrator of ability, a great traveller and ardent supporter of the conservative cause in politics, an active member of the local commercial and landowning society and a gifted and spirited observer of the world around her.
The present project will produce a complete transcription of the journals, edited to make them accessible to scholars and others interested in the many aspects of early nineteenth century life on which they throw light.
The process of editing will take account of the other papers left by Miss Lister, including the vast number of letters which she left and which have already been calendered and partly transcribed.

The partition of Ireland into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland in 1921 coincided with the onset of structural unemployment on an unprecedented scale which affected all major industries in the North: agriculture, shipbuilding/engineering and linen.
Since the 1920s Northern Ireland has usually been the most economically depressed region of the United Kingdom, and the secular decline of the linen industry is central to any explanation of this relatively poor performance.
This project aims to establish the chronology and to explain the decline of linen in the context of the experience of other natural fibre industries between 1914 and 1960.
The sources underpinning the project are principally unpublished company and trade association archives and contemporary journals and newspapers.
It is hoped to analyse the causes of frequent business failure and to assess attempts at rationalisation and reorganisation.
In addition the investigator examines critically the role of the devolved government which operated in Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972.
Through exten-sive examination of unpublished material the project hopes to contribute to the debate on the long run decline of textile manufacture in the United Kingdom and also help to increase our understanding of the process of de-industrialisation in Northern Ireland.

This research attempts to provide the first detailed study of the formation of the modern medical profession within the context of local communities.
The survey examines the development of the medical profession in three West Riding communities, Leeds, Wakefield and Huddersfield, during the period 1850 to 1920.
Arguably, the second half of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth century witnessed an increase in the power of medical men within medical institutions, and a rise in their social and professional status.
These theses are being studied with regard to medical groups in Leeds, Wakefield and Huddersfield.
The survey looks at changes in the number of medical men in practice during this period, and at their career structures, training, qualifications, practices and appointments.
The influence of broader legislative and structural developments on medical practitioners in the three towns is also examined.
A study is made of the social characteristics of medical men, their social origins, incomes, household structures, and place and type of residence.
Emphasis is placed on the processes by which medical practitioners attempted to further themselves both professionally and socially, through intra-professional activities and interaction with local ‘elite groups.
Special attention is paid to the relationship which developed between medical men and laymen within medical institutions, and through participation in local civic and voluntary activities.
The impact of demographic, economic, social and civic changes within the communities between 1850 and 1920 is also examined.

Thomas Balogh, who died in 1985, made numerous contributions to the professional literature of economics, and acted as adviser to many governments.
In particular, he acted as adviser to the Labour Party continuously from the 1930s till his death.
His papers are deposited at Balliol College, Oxford.
This project is to assess whether sufficient material exists to enable a more substantial research project to be undertaken.
There are a number of possible lines of inquiry.
One is how far advanced the Labour Party's thinking was on the nature of planning it might undertake if it took power at the end of the second world war.
A second is the extent to which the Labour Party had anticipated the problems it would face in the international financial market--Lord Balogh wrote extensively on international financial problems.
A third, more general topic, is an assessment of Lord Balogh's impact on economic policy both as an unofficial adviser to the Labour Party in the immediate postwar years and as an official adviser in the 1960s.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) is one of the handful of internationally important philosophers that England has produced.
Although most famous for his political philosophy, he also made significant contribitions to psychology, theology, metaphysics and physics.
This century has seen a great growth of scholarly interest in Hobbes' writings in all these fields.
However, the standard edition of Hobbes' writings is nearly 150 years old and suffers from serious defects and omissions.
Work on a new edition was begun by Professor Howard Warrender, with grants from the SSRC, but was cut short by his death in 1985.
An editorial committee has been formed to continue this project, and it has appointed Dr Malcolm editor of the next volumes in the series: an edition of Leviathan in both its original texts (English and Latin), and what will be the first collected edition of Hobbes' correspondence.
The work involves the study and collation of early editions and manuscript sources in British and foreign libraries.

The focus of the project is the social and economic history of Aleppo between the latter years of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and the creation of the United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria in 1958.
During this period, Aleppo's status changed dramatically; from being a major trade centre and quasi-independent Ottoman provincial capital, it became part of the new Syrian state and subordinate to the capital Damascus.
As cities have always acted as the principal focus of political and socio-economic life in the Middle East, the study of Aleppo will show the way in which communal, sectarian and other allegiances did or did not permit the emergence of a wider ‘national’ outlook.
In most Middle Eastern and Islamic societies, the persistence of particularistic and ‘primordial’ loyalties has meant that the process of nation formation has been especially complex and problematic.
A study of the incorporation of the highly fragmented communities, typical of late 19th and early 20th century Ottoman society, into a modern state structure will identify the circumstances under which group, religious and ethnic loyalties either disintegrate, remain active, or are revived.
The research will concentrate particularly on the changing role of the city's political and economic elites.
In the early part of the period these were essentially landowners, religious functionaries and bureaucrats, but as the city's function gradually changed to accommodate the new political and economic realities, a new ‘modern entrepreneurial’ elite emerged which took advantage of the new circumstances and in particular of the boom conditions of the late 1930s.

The abandonment of free trade by Britain in 1931/2 has attracted growing interest from historians and economists in recent years.
Although a number of publications and theses have added greatly to our knowledge of the issue, none has provided a comprehensive study of the adoption of tariffs.
This research project focuses on three related aspects of the introduction of protection which have been comparatively neglected.
Most attention is devoted to the role of individual industries, especially the ‘new’ industries, in the protectionist movement of the 1920s.
A second issue explored is the switch in the attitude of much of the City of London between 1926 and 1930.
The third aspect examined is the inquiry by the Conservative Research Department into tariffs during 1930, and in particular the correspondence etc between the committee and industrial organisations, together with the development of the committee's ideas.
Research is based on archive material, especially in the Bodleian Library (Conservative Research Department), Warwick University (industrial organisations, including the Federation of British Industries), the Public Record Office and the House of Lords Record Office (Empire Industries Association, Hannan and Beaverbrook papers).

The central idea of the project is to analyse the relations between the great magnates of England and the lesser nobility dependent on them, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
It seems from the work of earlier historians that at some time around 1200 the influence of the great magnates underwent a challenge: in part this was because the king was intruding more and more into what had been the magnates' private preserve, the distribution of justice to their feudal tenants; in part also because rising inflation damaged their incomes; and because the individual ambitions of certain of the men who had been the tenants of their knights' fees led them to seek their advancement outside their natural lords' followings.
But the influence of the great magnates survived this change.
Somehow they regrouped and recouped their losses, making as much as they could out of their connection with the king's court, and rebuilding their followings by recruiting men to their retinues and councils on a less feudal basis, distributing money rents and patronage instead of knights' fees.
In the process of this change a new society appeared, which has been called ‘bastard feudalism’.
The magnates ruled the localities by the end of the thirteenth century as political bosses, rather than as the petty princes they had been in the twelfth century.
The project will analyse the following of selected great magnates: six English earldoms and one contemporary Norman county, to see what exactly was the chronology of the change; what sorts of men followed great magnates at what dates; and to discover how precisely the change happened.

The intention of this inquiry is to add to our knowledge of British and Imperial educational ideologies and the social history of the ancient universities.
In the late nineteenth century ‘Oxbridge’ was the matrix of the hugely influential moralistic ideology of athleticism--disseminated enthusiastically by alumni throughout the public, state and colonial school systems of Motherland and Empire.
The ramifications of ethical inspiration were even more widely dispersed.
It is far from notional to suggest that the activities characteristic of the rivers and playing fields of late nineteenth-century Oxford and Cambridge were load-bearing supports underpinning the moral structure of British and imperial society.
Attitudes, relationships and administrations owed much to the ethical imperatives of the playing fields.
The ethos and activities associated with ‘athleticism’ within the ‘Oxbridge’colleges influenced the educational and cultural practices of the empire and inspired the future recreational habits of the entire world.
The significance of the ancient universities for a world-wide cultural metamorphosis has still to be appreciated, investigated and evaluated, and this is the major purpose of this investigation.
The study will be an intensive and comparative inquiry involving comparison of the varied responses of selected ‘Oxbridge’ colleges, to the dominant ideology of the secondary system of education in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

Professor Davies, Dr S G Wheatcroft and others have been engaged for over ten years in a study of Soviet industrialisation, with special reference to the crucial years 1926-1937 in which the foundations of the present economic system were established.
The project has two major aspects.
Professor Davies' multi-volume work, The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia, focuses on the mutual impact of economic policy, institutions and development.
A series of studies by the research group have examined quantitative developments in capital investment, industrial production, trade and agriculture.
During this year, seconded to an ESRC personal research grant, Professor Davies works on the third and fourth volumes of Industrialisation, and together with Dr Wheatcroft begins preparation of a book summarising their findings on quantitative aspects of Soviet economic development.
The project is undertaken in conjunction with the ESRC project ‘Inter-Sectoral Transfers and Sources of Capital Investment in the USSR, 1926-1941’.

Laxton, in Nottinghamshire, is the only surviving example of the open field farming system which was common to much of Midland England between the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century.
Whilst much has been written about its open fields, the community at Laxton has received relatively little attention.
The project is designed with 3 major aims in view.
First, the intention is to document the social development of the village in order to extend and develop the well-known picture of open field farming.
Second, Laxton offers an opportunity of testing social change in the English countryside.
Various studies of enclosed parishes have emphasised the disruption caused by enclosure, but what happened in a village where this did not take place?
Laxton should provide an answer.
Third, the project aims to develop methods of record linkage using computer facilities which will be more widely applicable in historical studies.
To this end, a software package, FAMULUS 77, is being employed, which enables the researcher to handle large amounts of historical data over several centuries.
In particular, it facilitates the merging of files of information such as nineteenth-century census returns, with estate surveys, tithe maps etc.
The intention to produce a full-scale study of Laxton, and also to make available for other researchers the methodology employed.

The last decade has seen considerable historical research into the origins and development of the English Police concentrating overwhelmingly, on the early years 1829-1856.
This project aims to explore the period from the County and Borough Police Act (1856) to the police legislation of 1964.
It will seek to explain the rise of, persistence of, and limitations upon police legitimacy, to analyse the policeman's perception of his role in society, and to investigate how this perception informed police practice at both senior officer and lower rank level.
Linking with research groups in Europe it will assess the extent of differences between English and continental policemen.
The research involves the use of primary source materials in national and local archives.
A key element will be the researching of source material still held by different constabularies.
A general guide will be published to this documentation, and some of the material will be microfilmed for the benefit of other scholars and stored at the Open University.
The research has the backing of the Police History Society, a newly-formed organisation which was initially established by serving policemen.

With the emergence of chronic unemployment in the British economy in recent years, there has been growing interest in the performance of the interwar economy, when unemployment remained persistently high.
In addition there are parallels between the marked short run fluctuations in the UK since the 1970s and interwar cyclical movements.
It is the aim of this study to investigate the determinants of unemployment and the behaviour of wages and prices in interwar Britain, using as a starting point models which have been developed to analyse the current unemployment problem.
The project will examine the impact of factors acting on the supply side of the labour market, such as the size and composition of the labour force, the extent of trade union membership and the level of unemployment benefit.
It will focus also on the demand side of the market, looking at the impact of real wages on employment and the determinants of aggregate demand, such as world economic activity, competitiveness, and monetary and fiscal policy.
It is proposed to investigate factors operating at the industry level as well as the aggregate economy insofar as the limitations of data permit.
A considerable effort will be made to improve interwar statistics, in particular the development of quarterly series where possible.
This enables the labour market model to be estimated in both quarterly form and also provides data of interest in the field.
As a result of this work, it is hoped that the determinants of interwar unemployment will be better understood and that these findings can be related to the results of research on the postwar economy.
The study contributes towards a comprehensive view of the working of the labour market over a long period and of the sources of shocks disturbing the economy.

The history of western Europe between the collapse of the Roman Empire and c. 1000 AD is still a subject of great debate.
The written sources are few, and offer a selective view of this age.
In recent years, though, a great body of archaeological evidence, albeit haphazardly collected, throws new light on this debate.
The San Vincenzo project (set in central Italy) is an inter-disciplinary archaeological project, designed to examine this problem in research rather than haphazard conditions.
The remarkably well-preserved Dark Age monastery at San Vincenzo and the villages associated with it have been investigated to an extent never hitherto possible.
By using the remains at San Vincenzo as an index of this period, it is possible to interpret the other types of archaeological remains more fully.
Following this, by employing modern anthropological techniques, the economy of this elusive period can be reconstructed.
At the end, this should provide a new perspective of the decline of the Roman Empire and the formation of the European states.

Star singers have been remembered while the bulk of a sizeable profession has been ignored.
This will be a pioneer study of the Italian opera singing profession as a whole, from the beginnings of opera in the early seventeenth century to the latest point in the twentieth century at which historical inquiry can operate at an unrelaxed standard.
It will deal not only with stars but also with middling and minor singers and with members of the chorus; not only with Italians but with those non-Italian singers who specialised in Italian opera.
Though it will be centred on Italy the project will also look at changing conditions for singers in Europe and then, from the early nineteenth century, elsewhere, especially in the Americas.
Topics investigated will include: social origins of singers; their training; the castrati as a group (far wider than a handful of notorious star singers) and as a symptom of economic depression; the shift from reliance on royal or aristocratic patrons to professional independence and cash earnings; changing contractual arrangements; and singing as a means to social advancement and to women's independence.

This project is the second section of an economic and social history of Scottish railways in the nineteenth century, started in The Origins of the Scottish Railway System 1722-1844 (John Donald, 1983).
It will trace the causes and developments of the speculative mania of the mid-1840's, and then of the subsequent collapse of both unsuccessful projects and the profitability of established companies.
Aspects to be examined include the physical growth of the system; the financial and managerial structure of the companies; the identity and characteristics of projectors and subscribers; the costs and problems of construction; the contributions and reactions of various interest groups (eg landowners, merchants, industrialists); the problems of labour supply; and the impact of government policies.
Railway development will be placed within a broader context with assessment being made of its impact on financial institutions, on industrial expansion, on social change, and on the economy of Scotland as a whole.
Comparisons will also be made with contemporary events in England and Wales.

The main object of this project is to trace out the life-history of the Keynesian Revolution--from its sources in Keynes' own ‘life and times’ down to its expiry in the wake of the second oil shock in 1979.
It is a historical project with a strong economics and social science content.
Although the story of the Keynesian Revolution has been told before, it has not been tackled in this way before.
No one has yet made full use of the massive archival material available, which includes not just the twenty-nine volumes of Keynes' published Collected Writings, but also a great quantity of unpublished personal and economic papers, many of them only recently available for inspection.
Also, the story has never before been told in its proper historical and intellectual context.
First, the development of Keynes' economic thought has never been adequately related to the historical situation of Western societies in his day--which included not just the institutions of capitalism but also massive political disturbances such as the Bolshevik Revolution, the rise of Fascism, the two world wars, etc.
Secondly, the struggle between Keynes and ‘orthodoxy’ has been depicted too much as a battle of theory, not enough as a conflict between rival conceptions of the art and duty of government.
Finally, exegesis of Keynes' work has concentrated inordinately on the ‘model’ of the General Theory, to the exclusion of Keynes' earlier economic ideas and also his epistemology.
The purpose of this research is to remedy these deficiencies.
The project should be an important original contribution both to history in a larger sense and to the theory and practice of intellectual history.

In the middle decades of the nineteenth century a disastrous crop failure destroyed the economic base of the Scottish highlands, which led to mass emigration and encouraged a new series of peasant evictions.
The research aims to provide a comprehensive account of the last subsistence crisis in mainland Britain, by tracing its origins, the experience of the society during it and the long-term demographic, social and economic consequences for the highland area as a whole.
The research will be based on archival sources and newspaper and government reports held in depositories in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London.

This project explores the range of public attitudes to those new technologies and technical changes which characterised the inter-war years and the two decades following the Second World War.
Reflecting the researchers' belief that the notion of public acceptance of or resistance to new technologies is an over-generalised one, they draw important distinctions between
(i)
‘lay’ attitudes to technology and technical progress in general,
(ii)
attitudes towards new technologies held by the public as consumers, and
(iii)
the reaction to changes in production technology experienced by the public in the workplace.
Since the advent of mass electricity is one of the most striking features of the inter-war years, the project pays close attention to the manner in which these innovations associated with this phenomenon were viewed by the public.
In particular, the project looks at the implications of the manner in which rural and urban environments were changed as a result of large-scale overhead transmission; at public reaction to the transformation of the ways in which homes were heated, lit and cleaned; and at the response to the new forms of mass production facilitated by the use of electric power.
As part of the investigation into attitudes to mass electricity, the project explores the reception by the public of plans for a National Grid and looks at the way in which this programme was presented to those most likely to be environmentally and economically affected by its construction.
The project is completed by a brief survey of the debate which took place in the 1950s and 60s over the likely impact of new production technologies.
The generally optimistic tenor of this debate provides a revealing comparison with those public views examined for the earlier period.
This award is part of the Public acceptance of new technologies initiative (award reference number A/16/25/0000)

The research, which forms part of a larger study of agricultural labour and technology in Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries, has three main objectives.
The first concerns the structure and organisation of agricultural edge-tool manufacturing — its transition from a workshop trade to a factory-based industry dominated by a hierarchy of large integrated firms and, after 1920, following the collapse of its traditional markets, irreversible decline.
The second is to identify trends in the demand for agricultural edge-tools, their utilisation, and the effect of improvements in raw materials, design, and manufacturing techniques on working efficiency.
The third, and most interesting part of the research, is to explain the persistence into the 20th century of large numbers of local and regional designs of agricultural edge-tools and the failure of large manufacturers to standardise their products and reduce the number of lines until after the Second World War.
It is widely believed that the conservatism of the farm worker and his attachment to traditional styles obliged manufacturers to continue to produce the same wide range of designs as had been produced by local smiths in the pre-industrial period.
An alternative explanation here tested is that while many of the key-types are of great antiquity, the majority of so-called local designs were fixed and standardized in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a result of inter-firm competition based on product differentiation and changes in the methods of marketing and distribution.
Changes in manufacturing techniques did not lead to standardization and reduction of product lines.

The peoples of medieval western Europe tended historically to move towards political unity under monarchies exercising increasing administrative, military, and juridical authority, culminating in early modern nation-states.
Germany was an exception; it evolved into numerous territories ruled by dynastic magnates, prince-bishops and city oligarchies.
This was not the result of the German monarchy's defeat by an unscrupulous nobility.
It reflected essential drives within aristocratic society towards establishing political jurisdictions in local terms.
The research is to uncover and outline all the elements upon which multiple territorial entities could arise.
These include social differences between regions, in economy, custom, landscape and demography; the theory of lordship by which the psychological predominance of the magnates was maintained; the actual materials sustaining lordship, all the accumulated rights and jurisdictions over lands, villages, towns, forests, castles, monasteries, and communications.
The project is to include a survey of the dynastic, ecclesiastical, and urban powers which shaped these diverse elements into the new structure of small states.

Work already completed by the ESRC Cambridge Group has established the timing and scale of English population growth between 1540 and 1870 (E A Wrigley and R S Schofield, The Population History of England).
It also showed the close relationship between economic and demographic change in these centuries and, in particular, the central significance of nuptiality in influencing fertility levels, and through these in turn, population growth rates.
The analysis of a series of about twenty family reconstitution studies will throw new light on the changes in the timing and incidence of marriage which were so important, thus complementing and extending the earlier work.
In addition, the new knowledge about economic and demographic change in the past has suggested that it is urgent to reconsider several aspects of the received wisdom about the industrial revolution, notably the assumptions made by contemporaries about declining marginal returns in agriculture; changes in the occupational structure of the English labour force before and during the industrial revolution; and, more generally, the viability of the concept itself so far as it connotes a unitary and progressive phenomenon.
It is a truism that the industrial revolution created modern Britain, indeed the modern world, but although its consequences were momentous, neither its course nor its causes are well understood.

The USSR has been engaged in ‘economic co-operation’ with the less developed countries since 1954, providing equipment, materials and know-how for various projects on advantageous terms.
The value of each project is agreed in advance, and repayments are based on that value.
Since, however, deliveries are made in goods, no over-all statistics of annual disbursements of Soviet economic aid in financial terms have been published.
The object of this research is to compile statistics in US dollars terms of annual Soviet economic aid deliveries by monitoring progress on each project from start to finish, and relating this to the original value given to that project.
Such statistics could eventually be converted into real terms to show changes in the levels of Soviet aid, and into current prices for comparison with Western aid.
The present project is to cover a pilot project in which two countries — Turkey and Pakistan — are being studied in depth to test the methodology; other countries may also be studied as time allows.
It is also hoped to produce estimates across the board up to 1962 as a contribution to the complete picture up to the present.

The project is a pilot study to test the feasibility of computer analysis of data from the Dictionary of Business Biography, itself an ESRC-funded project which had collected the biographies of over a thousand leading English and Welsh businessmen active between 1860 and 1980.
The aim is to check that sufficient information has been gathered for each variable to make statistics upon them valid.
The computer programme used in the preparation of the data is to be SCSS, the interactive version of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
The investigation is to focus on a number of matters, including social and educational background; career patterns; religion; regions of activity; founders, inheritors and managers; business associations, public and political service; titles; estate at death; heirs and successors.

The persistently high inflation experienced in the United Kingdom in the 1970s highlighted the need for company accounts to be adjusted to reflect this factor.
Even with inflation as low as five per cent on average, the rate of return reported by individual companies may be substantially distorted.
This study is concerned with identifying how far the inflation adjusted accounts which have been produced by large quoted companies over the past three years have economic consequences.
There are additional costs of producing the accounts both direct and indirect.
There are possible benefits; these include benefits to investors, financial agents and government agencies who may obtain a better idea of the performance of different companies.
There may also be benefits in terms of decision taking within the company concerned.
The research is looking at the issues from a variety of angles.
It is looking at the relationship between share prices and inflation adjusted accounts.
The research also analyses the effects of alternative definitions of a gearing adjustment on CCA results.
But the major thrust is identifying factors which are associated with companies decisions to comply or not to comply with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 16’ Current Cost Accounting’.

There are two conflicting theories in retailing relating to the decline of the small business — that the decline in the number of independent retail grocery outlets is the result of
(i)
price competition from the multiples
(ii)
the managerial inefficiency of the independents.
In 1984 the wholesale company, Nurdin & Peacock, commissioned a set of video films on the management of small shops.
Using these films as the main teaching aid, the company initiated a programme of management training for small shopkeepers.
The research project monitored the effects of training on the participants of one of the training programmes held in Swansea.
It did this by monitoring business performance and by surveying consumer reactions both before and after the training programme.
The current emphasis on management training in the independent sector of the retail trades stems from the recommendations made by an SSRC sponsored study of ‘Small Scale Retailing in the UK’(grant no HR 3237) which was carried out in 1975-77.
It follows subsequent experimental work undertaken by Dr Kirby in Mid Wales from 1981-83.

Utilising at a local level the dynamic model of the building process developed at macro level by the Building and Civil Engineering Economic Development Council (see ‘How Flexible is Construction: a Study of Resources and Participants in the Construction Process’ NEDC HMSO 1978) the research is intended to provide a detailed profile of the construction industry into the counties of West Glamorgan and Dyfed.
Being a preliminary study, it will concentrate on the collation of existing data from such diverse sources as the Departments of Employment and the Environment, Local Authorities, Employers Associations, Professional Bodies and the Trades Unions connected with the Construction Industry.
This will result in a greater understanding of the industry's capacities and needs.
The primary focus will be the labour market but its relationship to issues concerned with the local retention of wealth created through the construction process will also be examined as will the facilities for training and adapting the workforce.

The Redundancy Payments Act of 1965 was introduced to give redundant workers some recompense for losing their jobs and to encourage companies to release labour they no longer required (feather-bedding), thereby encouraging labour mobility in the face of growing changes in the technological make-up of industry.
By the 1980's the original aims seem irrelevant due to high levels of unemployment and long personal periods out of work, which are not covered by the Redundancy Payments Act.
Labour mobility has been achieved by market mechanisms, and training and re-training of redundant workers has assumed greater proportions than ever envisaged by the original Act.
A further problem concerns the relevance of the actual statutory payments made under redundancy agreements.
In the public sector in coal, steel and parts of teaching, ex-gratia payments have been considerable, whilst in the private sector companies have been willing similarly to pay high redundancy sums to facilitate agreements.
The research, sponsored by the Wales TUC will investigate the degree of discrepancy of actual to statutory payments, the relevance of the 1965 Act to the parties negotiating redundancy agreements and will examine how far the changes in the 1975 Employment Protection Act have assisted trade unions in influencing redundancy negotiations.

When a new hotel opens what are the effects on existing hotels which compete for the same customers?
The research aims to provide some answers to this difficult problem and suggest possible future research.
A second aim is to identify possible new markets for the company which requested the research.
A postal survey of a national sample of 250 managers of large hotels found that of the alternative strategies which are favoured when faced with new competitors a change in prices is regarded as relatively unimportant whereas non-price strategies, such as sales promotion and refurbishment of premises, are.
It is suggested that the growth of the market is critical.
In a declining or stagnating hotel market the most likely impact of a new competitor is a reduction in the market shares of existing hotels, and therefore, profits.
Because of high fixed costs as a proportion of total costs any reductions of a hotel's turnover, however small, are likely to lead to proportionately larger profit reductions.
However, as the entry of a new hotel is a relatively slow process from planning appliction to operation this should give sufficient time for existing hotels to develop appropriate strategies.
Finally, it is suggested that there has to be a case by case approach to the possible impact of each new hotel because each hotel market is different in terms of numbers of competitors, the location, size and growth of that market, the nature of the new hotel and the range of reactions of existing hotels to the new rival.

The study was designed to examine the performance of a Welsh rural enterprise trust (Powys Self Help).
Whilst some preliminary evaluation of local enterprise agencies has taken place, none has focused on the particular conditions of business development in rural areas.
Evaluation of the Trust's activities was undertaken principally via a questionnaire of a sample of past clients (n=78, a response rate of 39 percent), supplementing this with a systematic monitoring of enquiries at the Powys Self Help office (using self record diaries over a two week period) and conducting interviews with individuals associated with the organisation.
In addition to providing some indication of the performance of the Trust (largely a positive indication), the client survey shed some further light on the major problems facing start-ups and small firms in rural areas, together with the perceived shortcomings of the existing support structure.
The results of this small-scale enquiry also pointed to a number of issues relating to enterprise generation and growth in rural areas which might fruitfully be researched on a larger scale.

The use of investment limits as a central control mechanism of multi-divisional firms is widespread.
This has important implications for the efficient allocation of resources within such firms.
The use of linear programming as an aid to decision making when allocating scarce investment funds has been widely advocated.
One major difficulty of such an approach is its inability to deal with multiple objectives.
Much recent management research has pointed to the multi-dimensional objectives of large divisionalised companies where ownership is separated from management.
An extension of linear programming which overcomes this objection is that of goal programming.
However, all currently proposed goal programming investment models utilise a priority structure formulation which is felt to be inappropriate to the dynamic environment in which most investment decisions are taken.
The purpose of this research is to develop a more adaptive algorithm which can be run on a micro- computer.
The approach used is an interactive one where the decision maker plays a positive part in the solution process itself.
This enables a full investigation of the decision maker's preferences to occur which leads to a satisfactory allocation of resources by the end of the solution procedure.
The new algorithm is being tested by executives in the finance department of large multinational companies.

British trade unions currently employ about 3,000 full-time officials engaged in organisation, recruitment, negotiation and a wide range of other duties.
They are very experienced and often very powerful figures within their unions, but have not been studied in depth for almost twenty years.
In the absence of reliable evidence about their attitudes and behaviour, the trade union officials have been viewed by some as a force for moderation and conservatism, by others as faithfully reflecting the views of their members, and by others as industrially and politically more militant than the members.
These views rest on different assumptions about the power and ideologies of trade union officials and the aim of this research is to try to establish how powerful are local trade union officials in their relations with shop stewards, and what sorts of ideologies inform their behaviour in these relationships.
Power and ideology are best examined in situ, in the course of continuing negotiations and disputes, and this approach dictates a combination of interviews and observations.
Because of the focus on full-time official-steward relationships, and the intensive nature of the research, investigation will be confined to a small sample of officers and stewards in no more than 3 unions, in one part of the country.

During the past 10 years considerable changes have taken place world-wide in the technology used in the motor vehicle industry.
The most important consequence of these changes has been an increase in the extent of automation of all stages of the production processes.
The research aims to document the nature and extent of these changes based on detailed survey work in a number of UK motor and component manufacturers.
The implications of these changes both for the number of people employed in and the types of skills required in the industry will be identified.
The overall significance of automation for manpower planning in the manufacture of motor vehicles can then be considered.

The institutional arrangements for controlling marine discharges of radioactivity in the UK and France are outlined.
The level of discharges from nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in the two countries are compared (namely the discharges from Sellafield, La Hague and Marcoule).
A review is given of the changes made in discharge practices at Sellafield over the years, and the reasons for those changes.
Difficulties in the use of the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) and of risk cost-benefit analysis for decision-making are discussed, including the problem of setting a monetary value for health detriment and for loss of human life.
The relevance of the factor of public acceptance is discussed, and mention is made of the attempt to address this through a ‘willingness-to-pay’ survey in the UK.
Finally, the difficulties of having an investment strategy which is formulated to take account of the sensitivity of public opinion are discussed.

Small business research has expanded rapidly in the past two decades but significant gaps still remain in our knowledge about the experiences of business proprietors in the years immediately following the launch of their enterprises.
Since many new firms fail in these early years, it is important, therefore, to explore the problems encountered.
In this research, follow-up interviews will be conducted with entrepreneurs who were previously the subjects of a study on entrepreneurial aspirations and motivations.
Comparisons will be made between the actual business experiences of the sample and the expectations reported during the original interviews.
Furthermore, the researchers aim to discover what managerial and organisational problems the sample experienced in the first three years of their firm's existence, how the role of owner/manager has influenced family life and the attitude of the sample towards the growth and development of their organisations.
In addition, they aim to distinguish between the problems experienced by
(a)
successful firms and
(b)
unsuccessful ones.
Since half of the original sample were women there will also be an opportunity to compare the experiences of male and female entrepreneurs.
Data will be collected by personal interviews.
The first section of these interviews will explore the ‘everyday world’ of respondents using a non- directive approach while the latter parts will be more structured.

The commercial application of expert systems in the UK has not been as widespread as was originally anticipated.
Despite their early promise and their growing acceptance within the USA, there has been some reluctance on the part of organiastions in the UK, with a few notable exceptions, to become heavily involved with expert systems development.
It has been suggested that expert systems might be ‘a solution looking for a problem’.
The long term objective of this research is to develop a means to assist in the selection of appropriate problems.
This will be achieved by analysing the criteria used to select expert system applications and comparing them with the criteria used to evaluate the feasibility of traditional data processing projects.
This currently funded project represents the first stage of this research.
Users will be interviewed at their premises to investigate in detail the factors surrounding the choice of application.
In the course of earlier related research in the context of accounting applications, contact has already been made with a number of UK organisations who are using, or about to use, expert systems.
This project was part of the New technologies and the firm initiative (F/24)

Sub-contracting is a way of life which generates a plethora of small manufacturing units where the managerial function can seldom be handled with anything resembling careless ease.
A detached view of managing the production function in a small firm is to see the task as designing a stable system in an ever-changing environment.
It is alleged that smaller organisations can respond quicker to change and that this is one of their strengths.
However, lack of technological formulation is an apparent weakness which is supposedly compensated by creativity and improvisation of process technology rather than produce technology.
The project will focus on one such small firm being part of a large ‘buyer-supplier's network centred on the Northern Ireland airframe component manufacturing sector.
In particular the project will examine the changing relationship between the small ‘supplier’ firm and the ‘buyer’organisation, a large aircraft and airframe component manufacturer, following the ‘supplier firms’implementation of a strategy to install ‘state-of-the-art’technology into a machine shop previously using conventional machine tools.
Essentially the project will assess the question of whether a competitive advantage can be sustained through planned technological change.

Considerable public attention has been focussed on the policy intentions of local councils over the last few years, especially those pursuing some unorthodox, radical or new policy aims.
This attention has been reflected by academic research concentrating on how and why local governments develop policy.
But as yet, however, much less attention has been given to an equally crucial dimension of local government activity — its capacity to actually achieve its policy intentions.
Very often these intentions demand interventions outside the local authority itself, so that policy becomes subject to a whole range of local social conditions and other social actors working in quite different contexts.
The gulf between intentions and capacity to achieve these intentions can become considerable.
This research intends to help plug this gap, using the example of women's initiatives in local government (women's committees etc) which seek to improve the social and economic position of women both inside councils and in their local areas.
The research will proceed in two major ways.
First, national monitoring of local government women's initiatives, supplemented by brief case studies, will discover what women's committees intend to do, what they have done and what political and financial resources they have to carry out their plans.
Secondly, two in-depth case studies (probably of Birmingham and Manchester) will take up the central question of why some women's initiatives are effective while others, with initially similar aims are not.
In producing this new empirical information, the project will also clarify two current theoretical debates.
First, it will modify concepts of patriarchy vis a vis the state.
Secondly, it will answer calls for a less economistic analysis of social change and behaviour.

In this project, the economies of the process of adaption to reduced demand in industrial markets is being studied in relation to the experience since 1973 of the steel industries in the European Communities, the United States and Japan.
The steel industry is a suitable sector for comparative analysis because its produce and processes of manufacture are similar among producing regions and output is widely traded internationally.
After the first oil shock in 1973, demand for steel began to fall in the industrial countries.
The patterns and speed of adjustment of supply to these trends varied among the three major regions.
Economic theory suggests that important factors affecting the adjustment process are: uncertainty about future demand; the presence of costs associated with leaving markets; the size structure of enterprises in the industry; the degree of competition or cooperation between them; and the nature of public policy towards the industry.
The research will study the importance of these, and other, factors by statistical analysis of industrial data, reviews of published information and series of interviews with a representative selection of enterprises in each region.

Many aspects of the interaction between employers and employees are not covered by formal contracts because important elements in that interaction are not readily measurable in a way that would make a formal contract enforceable in court.
These aspects, if articulated at all, must therefore be governed by informal agreements.
For an informal agreement to be effective, both parties must regard it as worthwhile to stick to their part of it, even though the agreement may not be legally enforceable.
That is, it must be self-enforcing.
The natural tool for analysing self-enforcing agreements is the theory of repeated games.
The project will make use of this to investigate what informal agreements between employers and employees will be self-enforcing and what implications the use of such agreements has for the nature of contractual relations in employment, for the internal labour organization of firms, for the way labour markets operate, and for the nature and level of unemployment.
Of particular concern in the research will be implications for the way wages and employment respond over business cycle and the implications for the wage and promotion profiles of employees as they age and approach retirement.

The topic of the research is the management buyout — the purchase of the whole or part of a company by its managers.
Management buyouts are a new and rapidly growing means of company takeover and new firm formation.
The buyout phenomenon, it has been suggested, reunites ownership and control in industry and encourages entrepreneurship.
The research will investigate the extent to which such claims are true, and what actually changes when management takes over.
Detailed interviews with management in a sample of bought out firms in Scotland will probe the financial and operational independent of such firms; the nature of on going ties with funding agencies and past parents; changes in internal organisation of the firm; and the firms' relationship to their surrounding areas.
Selected firms will be revisited regularly throughout the study, identifying changes as they occur.
Other members of the buyout community in Scotland, in particular the funding and advisory agencies, will be interviewed, identifying their role before, during and after buyout.
Changes in the accounting practices of bought out firms will also be analysed.
The findings will interest policy makers, the financial community and academics alike.

This is an historical study of the business strategies followed by large regional firms facing the loss of traditional markets.
The region, Lancashire and Cheshire, has historically been dominated by cotton manufacturing.
While much has been written about that industry as a whole, relatively little is known about the individual firms in it.
Even less is known about the strategies (the choice of technology, product or market) they followed when faced with the increasing loss of markets at home and abroad.
The focus on large firms (and not just textile ones) is designed to discover clues about how the whole region responded to the threat of industrial decline.
As evidence permits, the study will also explore the decision making of senior management inside firms.
In particular it will examine the applicability of the theory that a change of strategy within a firm invariably arose when outsider elements (eg junior directors, middle managers of external consultants) persuaded senior managers and directors that a gap existed between the firm's existing strategy and its external markets.

Interviews conducted by the investigators in the course of carrying out a pilot survey into the practice of management accounting, consultancy work and casual observation through visiting companies, have all provided substantial evidence of considerable divergence between the prescriptions of textbook theory and actual industrial practice.
Differences arise virtually throughout the range of activities which would normally be associated with the practice of management accounting.
Many therefore relate to fundamental accounting issues as well as to the more refined issues of theory.
Research is concentrated on two specific areas, so that each receives in-depth survey and analysis.
The first area is cost behaviour analysis: assumptions with respect to how costs vary with, for example, volume of activity, provide the basis for management decision making over a whole range of issues.
The second is transfer pricing: a subject which has received considerable attention in academic study, but where practice frequently seems to be restricted to what in theory may be regarded as the least satisfactory approaches.
The objective of the research is the development of a series of detailed case studies, each containing a thorough examination of the above-mentioned areas with respect to a sample of industrial companies.

In the 1980s the United Kingdom New Issue market in equities has been affected by two major developments.
First, the Stock Exchange has set up a new market in company equities called the Unlisted Securities Market (USM).
Less stringently regulated than the Official List operated by the Stock Exchange and open to smaller, less well-known companies, the USM is intended to promote and accommodate growth and vigour in the corporate sector of the economy.
Secondly, issue markets have been used by government to effect the privatisation of public sector businesses: notably British Telecommunications Plc.
In turn, the liberalisation of access to quoted, secondary status has been accompanied to growth by informal, Over-the-Counter markets, with trading organised outside the Stock Exchange's control.
Building on a data base for USM companies, this research analyses the resurgence of activity in the New Issues Market.
It examines the changes in client companies, in methods and processes of issuing and it investigates the mechanisms of the new markets.
The research is conducted by statistical analysis of secondary data on client companies and on market prices.

The poor performance of the UK manufacturing sector relative to other industrialised nations; its falling shares of export markets; and the benefits of UK membership of the European Communities form the basis for extended argument.
This project concentrates on a particular aspect of industrial organisation, namely cross-frontier joint ventures, that bears on all three of these problems.
It is becoming increasingly clear that export performance and investment abroad cannot be considered solely in the light of such traditional factors as relative export prices and financial rates of return of investment.
Barriers to trade exist not only, for example, in the form of tariffs and quotas but also in the administration and practices of trading countries; and the ability of UK firms to overcome these latter types of barriers is crucial.
Co-operation between UK and other EC firms in Joint Ventures is an important method of overcoming such barriers.
Also, where such Joint Ventures relate to production or Research & Development they have much wider implications for the growth of UK firms.
It is intended to establish both the level of such Joint Venture activity and, through interviews, the circumstances and form which are most advantageous to improved UK industrial performance.

For generations, hourly paid employees in manufacturing industry have been familiar with the daily ritual of ‘clocking’— the procedure of formally recording their time and attendance at work.
This project looks at the replacement of traditional electro-mechanical and manual systems for recording timekeeping and attendance by micro-processor based devices.
It is particularly aimed at examining the choices facing employers for recording employees' time and attendance, the implications for all parties concerned with operating new systems and the directions future developments might take.
The principal method of investigation is a series of case studies of organisations who have made or who are considering making changes in their time and attendance policies.
These studies will reveal insights not only about time recording policies, but also contribute to our knowledge of the issues surrounding the introduction of information technology into British industry more generally.

Few would deny that a critical factor for the success of British industry is the amount and quality of training received by our managers.
However, little is known about the extent and nature of such training in Britain.
This research project first involves contacting a representative sample of 12,000 British manufacturing companies.
This enables the investigator to establish the amount of training being undertaken and for companies doing little or none, why this is the case.
Companies have also been asked to describe the subjects covered in training and their future needs, the way training is being carried out and how it is rated.
All of this is being analysed for different industries, sizes of firms and types of companies.
Of special interests is the analysis of training needs and problems of small firms.
To supplement the above information, personal interviews are being conducted in a representative sample of 250 companies.
The results are linked to a company database to further enrich the analysis.

The micro-electronic automation of the manufacture of metal components is gathering pace, but different levels and methods of computerisation are likely to be adopted.
In a probably divergent trend of computer, integrated versus computer-assisted production systems there may also arise a dual pattern of work skills and employment.
Large firms pursuing the most sophisticated levels of managerially-directed computer-control of production processes will confine traditional metal working skills to marginal remedial tasks.
Smaller establishments, by contrast, may use computerised machine-tools and other automatic aids that will supplement, and be programmed by skilled shopfloor workers.
The aims of this research are to identify the conditions that have already led to either of these diverging trends in other countries and the likelihood of their influence in Britain; the consequences for job opportunities and skill-use following from either of these patterns; and the possibility of a conflict in relevant training and labour requirement arising from contrasting work practices.
Evidence from case studies of key establishments is being collected in interviews with operators, engineers, union representatives and managers.
Because relevant developments are more advanced there, the main investigations are conducted in the USA, Japan and Italy.

Since the 1970s, developments in the understanding of genetic processes and the manipulation and culture of cells have made it possible to create living organisms that are tailored to meet specific human needs.
In addition to its many benefits, the new technology has some potential risks, particularly from the release of genetically engineered microorganisms.
This research will study interactions between industry, government and pressure groups in the regulation of biotechnology hazards.
Governments are attempting, for the first time, to regulate a major new industry before damage has been caused to people or the environment.
However, this pro-active approach to risk regulation raises interesting new scientific and policy-related issues, among the most important being the stage of decision making at which human values should be taken into account.
The project will expand on and develop the method proposed by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution for achieving the ‘best practicable environmental option’(BPEO), in particular linking policy and psychological approaches to risk assessment with quantitative, scientific approaches.
A companion project, funded by the Joint Committee (ESRC/SERC), will be looking at ‘Strategic and R&D Decision Making in Biotechnology’ and will, among other things, explore the impact of risk regulation on companies' research strategies.

No computer industry in the world has developed without government support of some kind, although the mechanisms of this support vary considerably in market and non- market economies.
The research examines and evaluates such support in three very different national contexts all of which can claim successes in the computer field.
The methodology is qualitative (unstructured interviews, analyses of the academic and specialist literature), as is appropriate for an essentially exploratory study; yet the comparative approach provides both analytical depth and explanatory edge.
The research is policy-related in two areas.
First, factors contributing to the relative success of European late-developers in the computer industry will be of interest to a UK industry which is falling behind.
Second, the comparative perspective permits an examination of economic interrelationships between the three countries.
Sectoral studies of their respective computer industries illuminate larger European issues such as the re-birth of (West) Germany's dominance in Eastern European trade, and the special status of ‘inner German’(East- West) trade.
Both issues are of considerable significance to trade policy and developments within the European Community.

Data processing has been a key employment growth area in Britain over the past decade.
How have strategies for managing workers in data processing developed during this period of rapid growth and how do British managers' strategies compare with those in several different industrialised countries?
This project attempts to answer these questions, concentrating on computer programmers and systems analysts and building on the base of information gathered during the past few years at Bristol.
During that time, surveys covering over a hundred data processing installations were carried out.
The current project involves using similar questionnaires to gain information of a comparable nature in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Holland, USA and Japan, as well as further information in the UK.
Managerial strategies concerning supervision and measurement of work, promotion prospects, new programming methods and other factors affecting skill patterns are related to market conditions and technology.
International comparisons between management strategies used in data processing installations experiencing similar market and technology conditions permit the isolation and measurement of other variables.
In particular, it generates information about the effects of different national cultures, trade union organisations and government policies towards information technology.

A follow-up study to one carried out in 1970 — 71 into all companies registered in Scotland in 1969, and 65 of the entrepreneurs who founded new companies in that year.
The aim is to plot the success and failure of both companies and entrepreneurs, and in particular to shed light on the entrepreneurial life cycle.
The twenty year period has been particularly changeful in Scotland, encompassing the discovery of oil, recession, and the birth of new industries.
The fortunes of this cohort of companies should add to our knowledge of the impact of the business cycle on small businesses.
The study will also examine the accuracy of recall data about organisational founding: can the entrepreneurs remember the process, where and why are there inaccuracies?
Further by focusing on the individual it may possible to shed a new light on the propensity to business failure, a feature neglected by studies focusing only on companies.

This initiative started in October 1988, and is for five years.
The initiative was designed after consultation with industry, government and academics.
The prime objective is to advance understanding of the initiation and response to new technologies in firms, and to disseminate the findings to industry, government, and unions, as well as to the academic community.
Many of the researchers are studying developments in ‘high technology’ Industries — but certainly not to the exclusion of other industries.
The initiative has a large core project located at London Business School, a group of smaller research teams forming a supplementary core, and then a group of projects arranged around four themes: Finance, Skills, Product Markets and Collaboration.
The research in this initiative derives from the belief that for one reason or another, Britain's economic decline stems at least in part from insufficient investment in innovation.
Amongst the various diagnoses, the research in the initiative explores the following five factors:
(1)
organisations are resistant to change, or at any rate find change very hard to manage;
(2)
financial markets are too concerned with short-term considerations;
(3)
there are insufficient skills in the workforce to cope with new technologies;
(4)
marketing of new technology based products could be done better;
(5)
there is insufficient collaboration with our industrial partners (primarily, though not exclusively, in Europe).

Many Arts events, especially those with social rather than profit-making objectives, are finding that they are increasingly dependent on business sponsorship for their survival.
But winning new sponsorship deals can be extremely time consuming and frustrating for the organisers.
Knowing more about factors and behaviour patterns which are likely to improve their chances of gaining sponsorship would be invaluable to them and the communities which they serve.
The research is based around the Peterborough Country Music Festival, currently a successful local/national event.
It is a small commercial music festival which helps to support a large free family entertainment programme.
It aims to expand into an international festival which would perform both a social function for local residents and act as a major tourist attraction.
The whole festival is heavily dependent on sponsorship and for the last five years it has successfully attracted and maintained a number of business sponsors both locally and nationally.
In order to survive and expand it will need more sponsorships and an increased awareness of the current market penetration.

The estate agency sector has been one of the most dynamic industrial sectors in 1980s Britain, and there has been a large growth both in the number of firms of estate agents and in the numbers employed within these firms.
Estate agents succesfully rode the property boom of the mid 1980s.
One consequence of this boom was the large scale corporate invasion of the estate agency sector, a sector that had previously been dominated by mediumD and smallD sized firms.
Financial institutions such as building societies, banks and insurance companies bought up estate agents to build national networks of offices in which they could sell housing-related financial services.
However, the late 1980s has seen the UK housing market enter a much less buoyant phase, with the result that the estate agency sector has entered a period of severe retrenchment.
The main aims of the research project are as follows.
First, to examine the relationship between corporate change and changing market conditions in the sector.
Second, to investigate the influence of firms upon the localities in which they operate, through detailed studies of estate agents in three contrasting housing markets areas D Richmond, Cardiff, and Blackburn.
Third, to examine the impact of employment change within the estate agency sectors upon local labour market change.
Fourth, to assess to the extent to which estate agents have an impact on the housing market.
The main method of investigation will be an extensive survey of estate agents coupled with three intensive local area studies.
The results of the research project will hopefully provide a better understanding of the functioning of the estate agency sector as a whole and will reveal forms of organisational change that take place within a small-firm sector subject to rapid corporate invasion, paying particular attention to the way in which changes and impacts vary between localities.

The project involves the assessment of the impact of Regulation 84/83 (Block Exemption from Article 85/3 of The Treaty of Rome for Brewing and Petrol Exclusive Purchasing Agreements) by the EEC on a British institution, the Working Men's Clubs.
These clubs are represented by an association, the Club and Institute Union (3,800 clubs/4 million members) which, through the agencies of CORCA (The Committee of Registered Clubs and Associations) and an All Party Parliamentary group, attempts to see that their interests are preserved in national legislation.
Because clubs have a social, recreational and educational function, and are non-profit making, they are recognised as having non commercial status and are subject to special provision within the licensing laws and other laws.
Recognition of this special status is essential for their continuing to play an important part in their communities.
However, there is and has been no club lobby of the European Parliament, and although most clubs are affected by exclusive purchasing agreements they played no part in the construction of Reg 84/83, whose operation now affects them.
The aim of the investigation is to interpret the legislation in consultation with the commission and brewers; to examine the way in which brewers' responses to the regulation are affecting or could affect clubs; to assess the implications for the social role of clubs of this commercial regulation; to examine similar effects of the extending of the free-market philosophy of the EEC; and to identify shortcomings or inadequacies in the legal provision to cover social divergences between Britain and Europe.

The high salary levels of the top executives in large British companies have attracted considerable public interest in recent years.
League tables ranking the top earners show executives such as Tiny Rowland of Lonrho and Sir Ralph Halpern of Burton enjoying salaries of around 1 million per year.
Such levels of pay inevitably raise the question, ‘are they worth it?’.
At British Airways, Lord King's recent pay rise from 178,000 to 386,000 even provoked a disapproving comment from the Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher.
The study will combine DTI Company Statistics with London Business School's London Share Price Data Base to provide details on the top executive pay, company characteristics and share price performance for a sample of large companies over a twenty year period.
This data will be used to test for any link between top executive pay and company performance.
Use will also be made of information collected from documentary sources, such as company annual reports, and a small number of companies will be selected for case studies.

The role of the City of London as one of the world's three leading financial centres is widely acknowledged.
Its continued success during the 1990s will depend upon its ability to maintain the distinctive built form and environment that makes it so attractive to international business decision-makers.
The research will examine the way in which sophisticated telecommunications and information technology has changed the appearance and internal structure of office buildings.
This has made many existing office buildings in the City inadequate for the needs of national and international financial and business services.
The choice is to extensively renovate or to completely replace them with ‘intelligent buildings’.
But how can land use planners reconcile this with the protection of the historic City with its scale and unique environment which is such a magnet to international service firms.
The City must also confront competition from new office development around its fringes and in the London Docklands.
The research will measure the impact of this on the scope for successful internal readjustments in the City.
The principal method of investigation is the construction of a large data base from information about the suppliers, users and regulators of telecommunications and of office building in the City.
A survey of recent occupiers of new office buildings in the City will also be undertaken.

OEDIPUS is a real-time computerised flight-planning system.
In July 1985 a medium-sized airline adopted OEDIPUS with the aims of removing routine tasks from flight crew and navigation planners increasing operational efficiency and saving fuel.
OEDIPUS can potentially save fuel by choosing the best possible route and altitudes at which to fly and by predicting more accurately how much fuel is to be carried thereby reducing aircraft payloads and fuel use.
The research aims to assess the accuracy of OEDIPUS by comparing the accuracy of its predictions for fuel use, flight times and payloads with the values observed in practice.
Where significant differences arise these are investigated to see how they arose.
It is hoped to be able to use the results of the research to improve the OEDIPUS system.

The research aims to increase understanding of the ways in which business organisations cope with the uncertainties inherent in new product development and marketing.
Two pilot studies are involved.
The first, involving mainly large enterprises, investigates the role of industrial users in the development and implementation of process innovations and their subsequent commercial exploitation as product innovations.
Although the practice whereby user firms invent and exploit new processes internally has recently received attention, this research is intended to identify and describe situations in which those firms act entrepreneurially to exploit their innovations in product markets.
Several case studies have been concluded.
The second pilot investigation is concerned with the innovative activities of small firms.
Having come into being to market a single product or service, small firms must reach a stage where additional new products are required in order to fill the ‘product gap’.
The purpose of this research is to identify any decision processes which take place as part of this extension of product/market scope.
Fifteen interviews with a range of small businesses have been concluded.
The pilot studies are intended to lay the foundation for more detailed research into the role of effective innovation in corporate competitiveness.
The report will discuss this aspect and make specific proposals for further investigation.
This project was part of the Competitiveness and regeneration of British industry initiative (award reference WF/20/25/0014)

On a national scale, the numerically and financially important small hotel businesses, which play a vital role in the provision of the national stock of tourist accommodation may be performing less well than they could.
The principal aim of this national survey of these small businesses is to provide previously unavailable data regarding the nature of their operating efficiency, staffing, and potential training needs, in order to identify strategies for improving performance.
The characteristics and attitudes of people entering the sector as owner/occupiers is considered to be especially important and is likely to mark this small business sector as unique in relation to other sectors.
Further studies will then be able to take a sampling frame which is representative of the national spectrum of small hotel businesses; to consider specific issues highlighted in the pilot study (aspects of the uptake of information technology, the need for training programmes, and the development of co-operative marketing schemes); and to develop conceptual and theoretical issues relating to behavioural matters (for example, population migration and job shift); together with investment; and marketing decision making.
The findings are intended to provide all parties interested in small hotel businesses with a clearer appreciation of the real motivations of, and the weaknesses behind, the operation of this increasingly important sector.

This project is an examination of marketing behaviour.
More than fifty small manufacturing firms with up to 1,000 employees are being examined.
Key personnel in Dorset-Hampshire companies are being interviewed using an open unstructured personal questionnaire.
Are small firms market conscious?
What is the extent of market research, demand forecasting, advertising, product development, and exporting?
How flexible is pricing?
What profit margins are expected?
Do firms employ investment related marketing strategies?
To what extent does the economic climate influence sales promotion?
Do firms employ consultants to assist with marketing?
What are the main sales constraints?
Is service constantly being improved?
What could the firms themselves do to make marketing more efficient?
These, and related, areas of marketing are worthy of detailed investigation.
The overall intention is to provide all interested parties with a clearer appreciation of the real motivations of, and weaknesses behind, marketing decision making, and to lay the foundations for the solving of those marketing problems which may be exposed.

The concept of flexibility was at the centre of debates surrounding economic restructuring throughout the 1980s.
Among management practitioners and government advisors the consensus of opinion was that if manufacturing industry could become more flexible it would be more responsive the perceived more turbulent market environment of the 1980s and 90s.
However for many academics, particularly in the areas of industrial sociology and industrial relations, the focus on labour flexibility was seen as an excuse by management to blame the workforce for the problems endemic in British manufacturing, Sweeping generalisations about the degree to which the British workforce had accepted changes and become more flexible were found questionable and often dismissed as being exaggerated or as having always been in existence.
The aim of this research is to address some of the questions provoked by the flexibility debate.
The study will show to what extent the concept of flexibility has penetrated management thinking in the electronics industry and will show, through the use of detailed case analysis rather than survey evidence, the extent to which flexibility has been used as an ideology in which industrial decline is attributed to the restrictive practices of trade union organisation.
Case evidence can more thoroughly show the changes which have taken place in this sector and can investigate the effectiveness of flexibility as a strategy for industrial regeneration in this sector.

This project is examining several hypotheses about the management of managers.
It aims to shed light on how employing organisations manage their managerial employees, with particular regard to organisational and technological change.
It focuses on corporate approaches to managing such staff, e.g. recruitment, selection, appraisal, development, motivation, salary structures, discipline, dismissal and on the characteristics of unions which are recruiting managers, on the extent that managerial unionists experience conflicts of interests between their employer and the union, on the extent to which they tend to be ‘moderate’ or ‘militant’and on how managers' unions relate to other unions.
The project has practical relevance to managers, their employers, unions and for those who make public policy on management and industrial relations.
The research is concentrating on middle managers (or, to use the more wide-ranging French term, cadres) and it is drawing on a range of case study methods.

The last decade or so has seen significant changes in patterns of employment.
These include the absolute and relative increase in part-time employment, especially for women, the increasing use of short-term and temporary contracts, and the growth of homeworking and of self-employment.
The 1984 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey contains data, for a large sample of establishments, on part-time employment, the use of outworkers, the employment of workers on fixed contracts, and the use of temporary employees.
The aims of the project are to analyse these data to determine the distribution of these forms of employment and to explore the relationships between their use and other characteristics of the enterprises concerned about which information is available.
Particular attention will be paid to the recent employment record and other current employment practices of the establishments concerned, to their industrial relations situation and recent record, and to their background characteristics such as size, industry, ownership etc.
The primary outcome of the project will be a descriptive account of the employment characteristics of establishments in British industry, which can be compared with the situation recorded by the 1980 survey, but it is also hoped to consider the findings in the context of current debates about labour market segmentation.

A long standing issue in accounting has been how to eliminate from the traditional measures of profit any element due to inflation.
In March 1980, the UK professional accounting bodies issued an experimental method (Current Cost Accounting) to deal with this problem.
The purpose of the research is to assess the success of the new measurement system, which is now being employed by most UK companies.
The research employs stock market reaction methodology developed by Beaver in the USA.
Briefly, the method judges the importance of information by the extent to which it changes investors' expectations about profit, which is reflected by changes in stock prices oround the day the information is announced.
Some preliminary work to be published by the investigators indicates that on a small sample of 17 companies, current cost accounting information has an impact on stock prices.
It is intended that the study should be extended to some 200 large UK companies, incorporating a variety of methodological refinements not previously employed in the literature.

Marketing people make decisions concerning what products should be sold, how they should be promoted, where they should be sold and the price that should be charged for them.
To be able to make these decisions effectively they require information about their customers, competitors, distributors, suppliers, costs and environment.
This information may be available from a variety of sources, company personnel, households, experts, government, trade organisations, research companies, libraries, directories, competitors and distributors.
The information may be collected by a variety of methods: the company's internal accounting system, marketing research system and marketing intelligence system.
These systems form the basis of a company's marketing management information system.
Advances in computer technology have improved the possibilities for the amount of information that can be stored, the speed with which it can be retrieved, the level of sophistication of information analysis and the simulation of future possibilities.
The project concerns the extent to which companies have taken advantage of these possibilities.
This initial stage of the project is exploratory and comprises approximately thirty in-depth interviews with marketing managers, computer software houses, and computer manufacturers.
The overall aim of the project is to evaluate current company practice with reference to marketing management information systems.

Local enterprise agencies offer free advice and counselling to people who own or are considering setting up a small business.
The main aim of these agencies, many of which are sponsored by established companies in the local community, is to encourage the growth of small businesses and to stimulate employment in the area.
The research will assess the management and effectiveness of one local enterprise agency based in Colchester, Essex.
A sample of the agency's clients will be asked how the advice given by the agency has helped them in running their small business.
In addition, the research will examine whether the agency's management structure and information systems are adequate for achieving its objective of promoting the growth of small businesses in the local community.

In 1992 the European Community will become a single market, opening up opportunities to manufacturing companies throughout Europe.
This change has focussed attention on the effectiveness of organisations in the member states.
Of particular interest is the manufacturing industry in West Germany.
Success in key areas has made Germany the world leader in the export of manufactured goods.
In contrast to this is the decline of manufacturing industries in Britain.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the machine tool industry.
It has been suggested that the success of the Germans is due to their ability to develop long-term relationships with their customers based on product quality and reliability.
On the other hand the British are concerned much more with industrial efficiency and short-term profitability at the expense of long-term market performance.
This research will examine the effect of marketing strategies and organisational characteristics on a company's performance by means of a comparative study of British and German machine tool manufacturers.
The study aims to determine the common strategies and features of companies that are successful and those that are less successful.
In doing so the project aims to establish whether successful strategies in one country could be adopted by those in the other country.

The performance of local government has been the focus of considerable rhetoric since the first Thatcher administration was elected.
The Audit Commission was established in 1982 to address this issue and has campaigned vigorously for the introduction of performance review considering this an appropriate response to many of the problems perceived to be afflicting local authorities.
However, there is no standard definition or process which constitutes performance review and a number of councils who have introduced review procedures have had disappointing results.
The purpose of this research is to explore the characteristics, both organisational and environmental, which are required for successful performance review implementation.
In-depth studies will be conducted with authorities who are recognised as having made considerable progress in this field and a postal survey of all British local authorities will be undertaken to assess the extent to which performance measures and review procedures are utilised.
Although it is recognised that performance review must be tailored to local circumstances, generalisations can be made and it is intended that a good practice guide be drawn up based on experience to date.
The research will also explore the applicability of a relatively new and controversial technique called Data Envelopment Analysis to local authorities for comparing their relative efficiencies.

This research is based on the belief that one of the most practical ways of improving the effectiveness of Board-level thinking is by the increased use of the strategic decision support tools and methodologies now available and being developed.
These approaches cover a wide spectrum.
At one end there are the primarily technological approaches, whereby hardware and software are used to aid already established methods of decision making: examples are financial planning and Executive Information Systems.
At the other end of the spectrum are approaches in which an organisational and behavioural perspective is paramount, and in which a consultant facilitator plays a major role.
In such approaches information technology tools are used as adjuncts in the process of decision making.
Examples are Decision Conferencing and Meetingware.
Whilst these decision aids have been successfully used in certain instances, they are not in regular use in the majority of organisations.
The progress, status and success of these tools and methodologies are little known, because there has been no independent comparative evaluation.
This research project has two major objectives.
First, to identify the contributory factors of success in the use of Strategic Decision Support Systems in order to provide research data to assist in the further development of such systems.
Second, to produce guidelines for the matching of technological developments to user requirements.

Recent changes affecting the bus industry have brought about far-reaching implications for their organisational arrangements and operating environments.
The two most frequently cited examples are the continuing gradual decline of bus patronage accompanied by increasing car use and the introduction of legislation to instil a more competitive, market orientated operating environment.
In spite of the organisational and managerial implications of such changes, no systematic research has been undertaken.
This project aims to understand the variety of ways in which bus companies manage their undertakings in the context of declining patronage, with particular emphasis on the range of strategic responses made and how these have impacted upon the organisational cultures of selected bus operators.
Concepts deriving from organisational studies — such as research on areas like leadership, strategic management and organisational decline — will provide the focus for nine in-depth case studies.
The case studies will be undertaken to establish how a bus company operates from the viewpoint of its management and organisation.
This represents a new departure in both the study of public transport operators and the derivation and application of concepts relevant to organisation studies.
The project has developed out of previous research funded by the ESRC on decision making processes in transport operations.

Many local authorities are attempting to improve the economic prospects of their localities by encouraging the development and growth of small businesses.
In particular, many of them are attempting to raise the level of employment in the small business sector through the provision of financial assistance.
The aim of this project is to examine the extent to which Humberside County Council's programme of assistance to small firms has achieved its objectives in this respect.
The principal method of investigation is a postal survey of those companies who have received assistance, matched by a similar survey of a ‘control’ sample of other firms of similar size.
The postal surveys are to be followed up with a small number of interviews.
The information collected will cover changes in employment since receipt of the grant, recipients' views on the importance of the scheme, and further evidence on small firms' awareness of the various alternative sources of financial assistance.

This research project is the British component of the final stage of a comparative study in eight nations.
The objective is to trace the relationships between the values and attitudes of managers in small and medium sized enterprises, their strategies and their eventual performance.
The research concentrates on small firms in these manufacturing sectors: clothing and shoes, being a long established sector, food processing, being a more modern one, and electronics, being a fast developing one.

Over the last decade, many organisations in both public and private sectors have had to become more ‘market orientated’.
This study is examining the managerial process by which organisations develop a market-orientation.
The research involves eight detailed case studies in two sectors currently affected by ‘market-oriented’ change: the National Health Service and Industrial Research and Development.
Involving professional services, these two sectors represent particular challenges in managing change.
Client demands are likely to involve tensions with established professional practices and the commitment of the professionals themselves will be necessary to design and deliver appropriate change.
It expects to conclude with recommendations for managing the process of market-orientated change.

Recent advances in information technology have led to important changes in the operation of offices.
As a consequence, it is becoming more necessary to pay attention to new environmental conditions which are emerging.
Whilst the information revolution has resulted in a great deal of attention being paid to the technology of information processing, unfortunately less attention has been given to the environment in which this processing takes place.
To achieve anything approaching optimum effectiveness in the ‘technological office’, it is logical that the environment should be treated as an important part of the process.
Furthermore, an integrated approach to the design of the environment is fundamental to this.
This project therefore investigates the problems associated with integrated approaches to environmental design.
The project is specifically concentrating upon design demands stemming from changing office technology.

The research will have two main aims:
(i)
to contribute to understanding of the economic factors influencing the demand for and supply for adult vocational training
(ii)
to provide new estimates of several economic relationships reflecting the probability of obtaining job training, the private benefits of training (as reflected in career progress by individuals) and the social benefits of training (as reflected in increased labour mobility).
Major data sets have been established as a consequence of two individual surveys conducted in 1987 by the Policy Studies Institute for the Training Agency.
The first surveyed 2,500 individuals of whom about one third had received training in the last 3 years.
The second surveyed 1,500 individuals of whom half were participants in the old Job Training Scheme and the rest were a matched sample by a broad set of labour market characteristics.
These data will be used together with other sources to generate the estimates.
The policy issues to which the work is directed are those of efficiency and equity of private market provision of training and the related question of the justification for public subsidy.

Trade in technology, through licensing joint-venture or direct investment, may play an important role in determining the competitiveness of an industry.
However, very little is known about the extent of this trade or about the mechanics of the transactions which take place.
The first aim of this project is to identify the extent and form of technology trade in one sector of the Engineering industry,(metal-cutting machine tools).
Having achieved that first aim through a postal survey the project is going on to examine two major issues.
The first concerns the process by which companies become involved in technology trade, the factors which determine their decision between alternative approaches and the place of technology trade in their overall strategy.
The second concerns the flow of technical and commercial information which takes place between companies trading technology, their ability to absorb it, and the terms under which technology receivers are allowed to use the technology they have acquired.
The information needed for this part of the investigation will be drawn partly from the postal survey, and also from a series of interviews with firms in each of the three countries.

The purpose of this project is to consider the application of the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, and the 1978 Safety Representatives and Safety Committee Regulations.
These measures were intended to introduce a new era in health and safety particularly through methods of ‘self regulation’ backed by a minimum of general rules.
The project aims to consider the effect of these changes in two sectors of industry: construction and retailing.
These sectors are contrasted not only for their level of perceived risk but also because of their different measures of enforcement.
In construction this is done through an arm of the factory inspectorate, and in retail through local authority environmental health officers.
The findings in these two sectors will be contrasted with Dawson's earlier work in the chemicals industry.
The first part of the project examines the attitudes of employers, unions and other interest parties, notably in the Health and Safety Executive and the Health and Safety Commission, together with those responsible in local authorities.
The main part consists of a series of around 30 detailed case studies on construction sites and in shops.
These will consider in particular such issues as provision for safety, management involvement and responsibility, the standards policies and arrangements that exist, and relations with economic performance, industrial organisation, trade union involvement and other relevant factors.
Some effort is being made to look at general issues such as the effect of industrial organisation and firm size on standards and the form and value of published statistics.
Publications have included a detailed account of the effects of the 1974 Act and associated regulations, as well as to make recommendations on how health and safety standards might be improved.
A model for the effective management of health and safety at work has been produced.

The aims of the research were to study how events in organizational history pass into corporate culture by being turned into myths and stories, through a systematic collection, interpretation and analysis of organizational stories and myths.
The research material was collected through 51 semi-structured interviews.
The interviews aimed to elicit organizational stories from the respondents or accounts of critical incidents witnessed first-hand.
The research strategy was first to draw stories arising from the use of computers at the workplace, as computers are a common source of organizational narratives, and then move to other stories.
The interviews were tape-recorded.
Subsequently, 213 organizational narratives were extracted from the transcripts, classified and analysed with the help of a specially devised computer programme.
Different narratives based on the same events were juxtaposed and compared.
A number of major types of organizational narrative were identified and analysed, including tragic, comic, epic, romance, mystery and nostalgic.
The major story themes were extracted from these narratives.
Some central features of narrative construction were studied, including the gradual embellishment of stories and their emotional content.
The symbolism inherent in stories was analysed.

Over recent years, China has been undergoing large-scale reform and the management processes are changing rapidly.
The Chinese economy is now one of the fastest growing economies and opportunities for business are remarkable.
However, at present other European countries have significantly better trade links with China than Britain.
In order for negotiations to succeed and commercial agreements be established, companies need to understand the network of Chinese management and in particular, the decision-making processes at work.
In the past, studies of Chinese management have suffered from problems of access to the inner workings of organisations and enterprises.
This study overcomes these problems by collaborating on a reciprocal basis with people who are inside the system.
It is important that Chinese managers also have a similar understanding of British management methods and therefore the project places considerable emphasis on building up the knowledge of managers from both sides.
The research focusses on specific decisions in the areas of human resource management and technological investments in strategic enterprises closely matched between the UK and China.
It provides fundamental understanding of the inner dealings of organisations, and through the comparative study highlights the relationship of organisations with their wider environment.

Warwick University has carried out a survey of management handling of industrial relations in multi-establishment firms.
The survey was concerned with the development of corporate level policies on industrial relations, and the extent to which individual establishments were controlled from divisional or corporate headquarters.
The Imperial College section of the joint project was concerned with the introduction of new technology.
The survey of managers indicates extensive changes in British manufacturing and services between 1980 and 1985, especially in electrical engineering, food/drink/tobacco and banking/insurance/finance: change was less common in textiles/clothing/footwear.
Decision-making on change was decentralised, especially in manufacturing; the initiative for changes involving new equipment came from the industrial establishment in the majority of cases, although requiring the approval of head office (in most cases) or divisional office (in a minority of cases).
When change was introduced there was extensive discussion with employees, but little negotiation: discussions were more likely to be informal than formal, especially in retail/wholesale distribution and banking/insurance/finance.
The analysis attempted to link the introduction of change, and the methods used, to measures of perceived economic performance.
The analysis was inconclusive, but there are indications that change (especially change involving non-manual workers) was associated more with firms operating below capacity rather than at full capacity.
There is also a suggestion that changes involving non-manual workers may increase the overhead costs of firms, badly performing firms failing to realise the possible benefits of job reductions amongst non-manual workers.

Industrial relations studies conducted previously have concentrated exclusively on the workplace itself.
There is evidence that higher levels within organisations have an important influence on workplace personnel and industrial relations practices.
This study is being undertaken by IFF Research for the IRRU at the University of Warwick to understand the roles played by divisional and corporate management in the formulation and implementation of workplace personnel and industrial relations policies and practices.
The survey, which has the backing of the Institute of Personnel Management, consists of 440 hour-long face-to-face interviews with respondents in 180 organisations.
In all organisations, one interview is being conducted at plant level and one at the overall headquarters of the UK enterprise to which the plant belongs.
In organisations where there is an intermediate level (eg divisional, regional or subsidiary company headquarters) between the establishment and the enterprise headquarters, an interview is being conducted at this level also.
The research is covering six sectors of industry and will be supplemented at a later date by a series of case studies.

The advent of the single European market has encouraged the construction corporations of the EC to evaluate the possibilities of entering foreign European markets.
While international contracting on large development projects in the lesser developed countries is well established, there has been virtually no trading of construction services within Europe.
One of the main reasons for this is the differences between the ‘contracting systems’ for construction procurement in the various countries.
The research being undertaken is a unique opportunity for a detailed cross-national comparison of the contracting systems in the UK and France through a controlled pair of case studies of construction projects.
In March 1989, the French water company SGE acquired one of the larger UK construction corporations — Norwest Holst.
The opportunity to do this research arises from the programme of change management adopted by SGE aimed at assimilating its new subsidiary.
The two construction projects chosen for study are both 50 unit social housing projects in Le Mans and Bolton.
They are being constructed by operating divisions of SGE — SOGEA and Norwest Holst respectively.
Bolton and Le Mans are also twin towns of similar size and character.
Therefore, the choice of construction projects for the research holds constant as many elements of the business environment as is feasibly possible, allowing a focus on the different managerial practices in the two countries, and the ways in which SGE is trying to combine them.

Earlier research conducted at Staffordshire Potteries links illness, absence from work and expressions of discomfort at work with the organisation of work itself, especially work which involves assembly line type conditions, and which necessitates workers being tied to a machine for the entire working day.
It would seem then that if conditions of work were altered in order to give employees a greater control over such factors as the pace at which they work, and the arrangement of their working day around breaks at times which they feel are necessary, then certain improvements may be achieved.
Not only would working conditions and well-being be improved, but absenteeism may diminish and both productivity and quality be improved.
The experiments in this research consist of comparing two parallel production lines in each of the three settings — one in each of the production units at the factory.
One of the pair in each case has been changed, but both are being monitored over a 14 week period.
They are both being further monitored for 4 weeks when the experimental line returns to normal.
Monitoring covers sickness, injury and absence and also production indices, quantity, quality and losses.
Costings are being made before and after, and any gains compared with any additional costs involved in the change.
The project seeks to combine attention to economics and the human advantages of the redesigning of work.
The consistent purpose in all the changes is to expand the control individuals have over the work situation, their autonomy from management and their voluntary interdependence.

The finance and management of school education in England and Wales are central to the government's programme of education reform.
Local management of schools will result in changes in the practice of industrial relations throughout the school sector.
The research will include case studies of 20 schools in three local education authorities, examining change as it occurs.
While some aspects of education provision are being centralised in the course of reform, the management of staff is being decentralised.
Substantial elements of teachers' pay and conditions will be subject to local determination, at the levels of the LEA and the school.
New patterns of collective bargaining, of management organisation, and of trade union organisation will emerge within this framework.
The project aims to contribute to increasing understanding of industrial relations in the public sector.
It will also inform policy makers and industrial relations practitioners, by examining the consequences of introducing into the public sector management methods more commonly associated with some private sector enterprises.

Employers' strategies in labour markets are of theoretical interest to economists and sociologists, as well as a practical concern for employers and employees alike.
This exploratory study is confined to a form of 500 employees, which include professional and craft workers (largely male), and semi-skilled assembly workers (largely female).
Not only is the external labour market segmented by sex, but the skills remain marketable in spite of a recession that has reduced local opportunities for the semi-skilled.
The employer is building an internal labour market, with a view to retaining the skilled workers, but extends it to all employees, using payment premiums and participative management measures, in the hope of persuading workers to embrace such change as a competitive product market makes necessary.
The centre-piece of the study is interviews with a stratified random sample of 120 employees of all levels and departments, designed to test commitment to the firm and motivation to work, alongside opinions about changes actual and in prospect.
The schedule for these standard interviews will be piloted by extended semi-structured interviews with shop stewards and key management informants.
The findings of the survey will be fed back to discussion groups of employees for futher comment.

Design consultancy was one of the fastest growing sectors in the UK during the 1980s.
Its rapid growth rate was linked with that of the retail boom.
Consolidation and survival characterise this sector in the 1990s.
But as more companies outsource design skills and expertise the sector is likely to continue to expand.
Very little information is available about the design consultancy sector.
We are compiling data on the organisation and structure of the industry.
In addition, we are investigating the strategic management of Design consultancies.
Central to our research are questions such as: how do design firms cope with strategic change?
What role do client relations play in the business strategies of design firms?
What are the best practices in managing client relations?
Other countries have a more mature design consultancy industry.
In Denmark, for example, clients have long-lasting relations, spanning several generations, with a small number of design consultancies.
This is also true for the US.
It is not a common pattern in the UK, although many design consultancies are now trying to achieve this.
By developing in-depth cases of a variety of design projects from corporate identity, packaging and the design of new products, a profile of client-design relationships internationally we are gaining an insight into best practices of design management.

British firms have not allocated sufficient resources to technological innovation, and the environmental infrastructure for innovation has been fragmented and disparate.
Industrial innovation is crucial for the future and this proposal aims to inform the growing debate on how it should be successfully managed.
The project will achieve this by providing documented examples of successful technological product innovations and their management in newly established and small(er) firms.
The finalists of the 1981/82 and 1982/83 Competitions for the Prince of Wales Award for Industrial Innovation and Production provide a self-selected sample of firms that have been successful in innovation, ie in developing commercially viable new products.

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an experimental programme being undertaken by the Trident Trust.
This seeks to enlarge young people's concept of work beyond that of traditional employment.
The focus is on school-leavers from Bury who have attended a three work residential course in Cumbria.
Interviews conducted during the course indicate the importance of task achievement and of the related social processes which encourage self development; and these consequences appear to be sustained over time.
How far this is due to participants remaining in close touch with one another is being assessed.
A further grant of £2,000 has been made by The Trident Trust to extend the study in the Bury area.

British Gas intend to spend around £1 billion exploiting the Morecambe gas field.
The field was discovered in 1974 and 10 years later the first gas flowed ashore.
Heysham Harbour, near Lancaster, will be the operating base from which the field will be supplied and maintained over its estimated 40 year life.
The arrival of a new and major market in the Lancaster area represents a major opportunity for local firms.
However, the market is new, has unique needs and can be technologically complex.
This research project has been designed to discover whether, and how, local firms meet this challenge.
Most of the firms concerned are small and lie within a 10 mile radius of the University.
This means that it is possible to follow their activities closely over the 2 year period of the project.
In particular, their marketing strategies in relation to gasfield contracts and the formation of relationships with British Gas and the major gasfield contractors are being examined.
In addition, the activities of firms moving into the area in response to gasfield opportunities are also being monitored.
The results should provide valuable insights into marketing and purchasing, not only for local companies and British Gas, but in the wider context of the survival and growth of small companies in the economy as a whole.

The purpose of this project is to examine current evaluation practices of the implementation of new information technologies, which includes both advanced manufacturing technologies and new office technologies, within a representative range of British organisations.
The specific focus of the research is the ways the effects of the new technologies are evaluated, paying particular relevance to their social and organisational consequences.
Methods chosen for evaluation are of crucial importance to the development of policies.
Yet few guidelines concerning how best to do this presently exist.
By reviewing current practices and considering the relevance of evaluation theory developed for other organisation changes, the research aims to fill this gap.

There is evidence of a growing interest in payment systems in a variety of quarters, e.g. amongst economists there is renewed interest in the link between productivity and the way labour is paid; management theorists are paying more attention to new forms of payment within their overall interest in making in making firms more responsive; and amongst managers and government officials there has been considerable interest expressed in performance-related pay, merit-pay and profit-sharing.
It is therefore timely to access the extent to which payment system changes have been made, the reasons for them, and their significance especially in terms of productivity.
This research builds on an earlier survey based on a postal questionnaire by following up some of the respondents to the questionnaire.
It will involve indepth studies of forty firms principally concerned with studying changes in payment systems and then link to other personnel practices.
This project will therefore contribute to both
(a)
our understanding of payment systems, and
(b)
to our knowledge of developments in industrial relations, and personnel management, and particularly the debate about human resource management and the ‘new’ industrial relations.

Many agricultural livestock practices are currently experiencing a downturn in their level of economic activity for a variety of reasons, ie the reduction in Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food commissioned cattle testing duties, the short term effects of the EEC dairy quotas, and the improved animal husbandry skills of many farmers and herdsmen as a result of better farm education today.
A number of practices affiliated to the local Lakeland Veterinary Division (of the British Veterinary Association) requested a study of the relationship between their financial control procedures and their ability to market both veterinary services and pharmaceutical products to the farming community.
Ten practices are being examined in this study, and they collectively involve practices with a variety of software programmes on their computer systems as well as practices still utilising traditional manual procedures of control.
The study involves the researchers in an examination of the internal procedures of veterinary practice management in the different practices studied, as well as the interface between the veterinarians and their farmer clients.
The research programme is intended to provide local practices with guidance as to how best to improve their marketing of services and products to the agricultural sector.

The relationship between accounting earnings figures and stock prices has been extensively documented.
A less well understood relationship is that between the variability of accounting figures and stock returns.
The purpose of this research is to investigate the variability relationships between stock returns and accounting figures based on disaggregated or segmental reports.
The aims are twofold: i) to gain a better understanding of the nature of the relationships between accounting earnings variability and stock price variability.
ii) to uncover any additional information contained in the disaggregated data which may help to identify appropriate reportable segments from multi-activity companies.
The research will involve the creation of a computer database of segmental information for 100 of the largest publicly quoted companies.

The research aims to gather information on recent practice, and likely future developments, in the application of formal decision analysis models by public and private sector bodies in the USA.
The intention is to use this information to throw light on why British companies seem to be more reluctant than their US counterparts to make use of such methods.
Decision analysis is concerned with choice under uncertainty.
When applied in a commercial or public sector decision making context, it typically consists of three elements: eliciting from the decision making body its view of the likelihood of different possible futures relevant to the project under decision: assessing its valuation of alternative ways of tackling the project for all of the possible futures envisaged: suggesting the most appropriate course of action in the light of the two previous steps, using explicit and theoretically justifiable evaluation procedures.
The research is based principally on discussions with decision analysis practitioners in the USA.
It also involves an assessment of progress in the related field of expert systems, in particular, possible applications to strategic and other company planning problems.

Advanced manufacturing technology is widely put forward as holding out the opportunity to change the competitiveness of businesses.
In the UK much investment in this area has failed to produce its full benefit.
The research is aimed at examining the link between the capabilities of advanced manufacturing technology, the manufacturing policies of companies and the way in which they compete in the market place.
It is hoped that the research will lead to more effective application of new advanced manufacturing technology.

Income distribution and wealth; Labour economics
Issues surrounding differences in pay between people, occupations and industries are basic to economic theory and policy.
The same issues arise in different guises in industrial relations and management generally.
Income distribution is also an ethical matter.
Much has been written, and there is a wealth of models, theories and statistics, but there is little agreement on the facts, processes and causes of income differentials.
The nature of the problem is itself controversial, despite the voluminous work done.
This research aims, first, to explain why the general pattern of income has been largely resistant to attempts at change through legislation, government policy and interest-group pressure; secondly, to review the many kinds of research on income distribution; thirdly, to identify criteria for, and means of, improvement.
The general principle governing the work is that the determination of income of different groups is subject to identifiable, changeable ‘rules’(which are not always explicitly stated in any formal way).
The issues cut across many academic and practical activities.
The research is interdisciplinary, using several techniques: analysis of statistical sources, literature reviews, field studies and case-history material.
The focus is on the lowest-paid quarter of the working population, which provides many of the clearest illustrative examples of the ‘distributional rules’.

Over the past decade subcontracting small firms have formed a significant proportion of all new business formation on the UK and yet there is little known about the characteristics, performance and the specific needs/demand for financial services by these firms.
The purpose of the research is to examine the factors which have influenced the rapid growth of subcontracting over the past decade in certain sectors.
The study will be based upon a sample of UK small firms in two widely differing industrial sectors, namely, biotechnology and engineering where subcontracting has grown more rapidly in recent years.
The research will be carried out in three phases: Phase (I) will involve the analysis of the Companies House financial records of 200 subcontracting small firms in the two sectors.
In phase (II) of the study, the sampled firms will be surveyed by means of a postal questionnaire to provide additional information including for example, on the ownership of the firm, technical linkages and collaboration with other firms, major sources of finance and advice and their perceived adequacy in meeting specific needs/demand for financial services.
Phase (III) will be a series of interviews to obtain more detailed information on the strategic and tactical considerations involved for the contracting parties.
It is envisaged that an analysis of such information will enable the identification of those financial, entrepreneurial, technical and regional factors which are most associated with the growth and performance of subcontracting small firms and which distinguish them from other more ‘typical’ small firms.

Quality Circles have received a lot of attention in the media over the last three years but, in general, studies of Circles have so far been limited to subjective analysis by interested parties.
The research investigates the reasons why companies have introduced Quality Circles and evaluates their benefits and shortcomings.
The prerequisites for their successful implementation are identified along with the implications to the company of commencing a Quality Circle programme.
An analysis is being made of the methodology and operating characteristics of Quality Circles to find out how and why they actually work.
The research aims to determine why management supports and how management measures the success of a Quality Circle programme.
It investigates the effects of Quality Circles on Management style and attitudes, how they fit into companies' overall strategies towards improvement and innovation and how they help the present organisation to work more efficiently.
The principal method of investigation is in-depth studies with companies in different industries who are using Quality Circles.

Traditionally, the analysis of how companies compete within given markets has been subject to economic analysis.
Recently, it has become increasingly apparent this economic approach is limited.
It does not explore the cognitive processes at work in the way managers and consumers represent knowledge about a market.
A more cognitive approach is needed if the decisions made by managers and consumers are to be understood.
The first aim of the research is to identify how managers and consumers represent knowledge about competitors in a given market, and to develop a methodology that will accurately map this process.
The second aim is to identify similarities and differences between the knowledge representations of managers with different management functions and experience, and also the differences between managers and consumers.
It is also the aim of the project to identify which variables influence these similarities and differences.
At least two separate industries will be examined, to assess to what extent the results may be generalized.

Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented welter of managerial initiatives designed to put labour onto a more competitive footing by rendering it more flexible, productive, and oriented to quality.
A key feature of the battery of initiatives is that they have largely stemmed from a Human Resource Management approach which is directed at employees as individuals.
Examples include direct forms of communication, appraisal, and individualised performance related pay.
The previously prevailing system of employee relations which included an emphasis upon procedures jointly agreed with trade unions was, during this period, essentially neglected.
The infrastructure of this inherited approach was, however, largely maintained.
There are now signs that this failure to work out a coherent relationship between the two logics of approach will have to be addressed and in some cases this task has already been started.
The process of alignment between the two approaches is likely to be the crucial industrial relations issue of this decade and the purpose of this project is to track and interpret developments along this critical fissure.
A series of in-depth case studies across a number of sectors are being undertaken.
These will be used to examine the processes of change in companies and within trade unions and to explore the strategies and logics being used by both parties.

Small high technology firms are seen as an important force in the development of the UK economy.
Whilst it has been argued that such firms need financial and general business aid, if they are to fulfil their potential on a timely basis, little is known of their accounting/financial practices and needs.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether accounting practices need to be adjusted or developed if they are to be of use to firms operating in the highly changeful high technology sectors.
For the ‘classic’ business practices (such as yearly budgets and variance analysis) were only designed to operate efficiently when the firm and its environment were reasonably stable.

Shrimp fishing is Greenland's dominant industry, and is crucial to the country's economy.
Under the system of home rule introduced in Greenland in 11979, this industry has grown rapidly.
Since the late-1980s, however, it has faced a state of crisis characterised by overcapacity, poor returns and serious financial problems in the trawling sector.
New fisheries legislation which changed the basis for regulation of Greenland's shrimp fisheries and attached quasi-property rights to licences to fish were introduced in 1990/91, and were aimed at tackling the industry's problems.
This project aims to investigate the impact the new legislation has had.
Data will also be collected to analyse the effect of changes in accounting procedure upon firms in the industry.
The analyses completed will draw upon work from the field of industrial economics and will be placed in the context of a theoretical model of a coldwater shrimp fishery.
The study will provide detailed case-study material on alternative means of regulating fisheries, and apply the data collected to a model of wider application in the field of fisheries economics.
This project forms part of a Ph.D research on the development of Greenland's shrimp fishing and processing industry.

The attempt to minimise industrial conflict has been a goal of public policy in Britain at least since the last century when the Conciliation Act of 1896 was passed.
The concern of policy makers for the British bargaining system's ability to produce acceptable settlements without unnecessary high levels of industrial unrest increased in the 1960s (cf the Donovan Commission).
Unfortunately, there are still enormous gaps and matters of controversy in our understanding of both the wide variations in strike activity over time and the wide variations in strike activity between Britain and other countries.
The aim of this research is to investigate empirically the variations in Britain's strike activity over time and the variations between Britain and other EEC countries in the post-war period.
The research focuses on the interactions between the political system and the industrial relations system; that is, the size of the public sector and the welfare state, the strength electorally of social democratic and left parties, and the participation in government of left parties are all taken into account in trying to explain strike activity.
The research explores the determinants of strike activity using regression analyses of yearly time series data obtained from official statistics.

Japanese Companies in fields like consumer electronics, photocopiers, clocks and watches, ball and roller bearings, and cars, have dramatically increased their share of the British market in the last 25 years and give every appearance of continuing to grow.
Yet when they started out few people in Britain had ever heard of them and even now not much is known about their ideas on marketing and how they put them into effect.
But their success speaks for itself.
Their high degree of competitiveness is a lesson both for British companies that compete with them and for all those who are looking for ways to sharpen their competitive edge.
Building on the work of the Japan Industrial Studies Programme already carried out at the Policy Studies Institute, the aim is to find out how Japanese managers, especially those in companies that are competing in the British market, see marketing and how they succeed in putting their strategies into effect.
For this purpose, interviews will be held at Japanese companies in Britain and Japan, and at marketing associations etc, in Japan.
Standard questionnaire data will be collected.
How far Japanese marketing methods are being transferred to local staff in the UK will also be investigated.

The study is an extension of the project on ‘Asian Businesses in Glasgow’ which was conducted by the Queen's College, Glasgow, during 1984.
The study revealed that growth of Asian businesses was confined to few areas and, although this had been rapid during the 1970s, it had been declining recently.
This suggested that a more detailed investigation into growth patterns, particularly on a comparative basis, would be valuable.
The present study examines both indigenous and Asian businesses and isolates factors which have had an impact on present size, structure and performance.
Their potential to influence growth, through either expansion or diversification, is investigated.
Fifty businesses from both groups, covering a range of small and medium size firms, are being used to provide necessary information, obtained through interviews with the owner/managers using semi-structured questionnaires.
The analysis ascertains growth using criteria such as annual turn-over, employment and number of outlets.
The comparative advantages and disadvantages of the businesses are related to their respective growth characteristics.
This leads to the establishing of a model which attempts to identify and compare growth factors for the two business groups.
Finally, it is hoped to identify the necessary steps essential for the improvement of growth potential for ethnic minority businesses.

Despite its reputation as one of the most efficiently managed economies, Japan's system of labour-management relations remains an enigma in Britain and Europe.
What is the significance of Japanese management practices for attaining efficiency, economic growth and a loyal and committed workforce?
This proposal will examine this question by analysing the links between methods of employee participation in management decision taking and the achievement of organisational goals and objectives.
The main aim of this research project is to describe and evaluate the methods and processes by which employees participate in managerial decision making.
The project compares and analyses these methods and processes in a sample of establishments which are either planning or currently operationalising major organisational or technological change.
The proposed research examines the following areas:
(i)
Forms and methods of employee involvement in decision making;
(ii)
Level and type of decisions;
(iii)
Attitudes of management and trade union representatives towards the consequence of organisational change and technological innovation;
(iv)
Impact on labour-management relations.

It is nearly ten years since the Health and Safety at Work Act made statutory provisions for trade union involvement in occupational health and safety.
It is the investigator's experience during this time that improvements in awareness and involvement have been varied within the industries in which NGA members are employed.
The investigator is interested in finding out what are the factors that influence this variation in awareness and involvement.
The aim of the research is to discover what impact the HSW Act 1974 and the SRSC Regs 1977 have had on occupational health and safety in the print industry and to what extent the Robens philosophy has been relevant to joint regulation.
The research also examines the perception and evaluation of health and safety problems and goals by trade union representatives.
It considers the relationship between the statutory provisions on worker involvement in occupational health and safety and developments in related industrial relations matters such as trade union recognition, worker representative training and aspects of collective bargaining and joint consultation relating to specific hazards in the selected industry.

Superstores provide many job opportunities.
The research shows the types of jobs created and the job history of employees in these new stores.
The project indicates how retailers organise the labour in such stores and consequently the range of types of job created.
Comparisons are being made with other types of store.
To collect the data, surveys are being carried out in selected superstores and interviews are being undertaken with employees, managers, retail executives, union officers and job centres.
With employment opportunities in retailing increasing in number and changing in type, it is the aim of the project to consider exactly what changes are under way.

Britain's sustained decline in both domestic and foreign markets has triggered much research into the nature of commercial competitiveness.
Historically this research has focused on the role of technological innovations as a source of competitive advantage, but more recent efforts suggest that a marketing orientation is strongly associated with corporate success.
This study aims to define the dimensions of ‘a marketing orientation’ and to examine how such an orientation affects the overall competitiveness of the firm.
Similarly, the project seeks to define the pattern of corporate success.
A comparative approach will identify marketing factors which distinguish successful companies from less successful ones.
A five-phased approach begins with desk research, to identify and evaluate recent opinions of the contribution of marketing to corporate success.
Second, semi-structured depth interviews with a cross- section of opinion leaders to define the pattern of a marketing- orientation (such individuals as the Directors General of the CBI, Institute of Directors, BIM and the General Secretary of the TUC).
Third, structured interviews with a sample of successful firms to establish their philosophy and practices.
Fourth, interviews with a similar sample of unsuccessful firms.
Fifth, identify the characteristics of successful firms with particular emphasis on marketing factors.

This research project aims to develop understanding of the nature of trust in organisations and the role that different types of trust might play in facilitating the performance of people, and systems.
Previous research has shown that trust is a complex phenomenon and a variety of new measures are needed to capture its complexity.
Once theses have been established the project will examine the degree to which these different types of trust are affected by
(a)
individual factors such as values and personality and
(b)
factors in the situation such as quality control procedures and leadership styles/values.
The project will concentrate on service organisations because recent attempts to improve the quality of service necessarily entail the development of high levels of trust: e.g. between customer and provider, professional and client, customer and supplier.
Hospitals and financial services organisations are ones in which trust lies at the heart of the relationship and they will provide rich ground for exploring a variety of trusting relationships and testing out practical ideas about how trust is developed, maintained and improved.

‘Open and fair competition’ is often advocated as a virtue in sub-contracting, a trade relationship between a customer, firm and a supplier of components and materials.
This research is based on a contrasting hypothesis that a long-term relationship built on trust and obligation between a buyer and a sub-contractor leads to better cooperation in innovation, improved quality monitoring and prompt delivery, and that these gains outweigh efficiency loss resulting from rigidity in not switching customers or sub-contractors as prices dictate.
The investigation aims to establish what sub-contracting patterns in what circumstances are conducive to good business performance, and draw conclusions about whether they are specific to an industry or a nation, or transferrable across sectoral or national boundaries.
The method will be a three-way comparison, through visits to UK buyers and sub-contractors in the UK, Japanese buyers and sub-contractors in Japan, and Japanese subsidiaries and their UK sub-contractors in the UK.
It is expected that the research findings will be valuable to the UK industry (in particular, to UK firms wishing to increase their competitive edge by adopting ‘best practice’) and for better relations between Japanese subsidiaries and their UK suppliers.

There now exists a plethora of local economic development initiatives being implemented by local authorities and enterprise agencies throughout the UK seeking broadly to provide a range of business support mechanisms, which derive their justification somewhat confusingly from both a welfare and economic rationale pitched at the level of the local economy.
This study seeks to assess the role and impact of such interventions on the competitive orientation of firms within one local particular economy.
It aims to identify and analyse those factors which affect a firm's ability to compete, and to locate the role of intervention within this context.
The project aims to develop a methodology for determining a firm's ‘competitive stance’.
It also hypothesises that intervention is necessary, and indeed needs to take a particular form if the competitiveness of local firms is to be improved.
Investigation is mainly through a questionnaire survey concerning the firm's awareness of and capabilities within various ‘elements’ of its business.
The interview survey will look at both local intervened-in and non-intervened-in firms to allow conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of past interventions, and perhaps more importantly prescriptions to be made about their future direction.

Large multi product, multi site firms dominate the British economy in both manufacturing and the service sectors, and public sector concerns increasingly seek to organise themselves along the lines adopted by successful private sector corporations.
The multi-divisional company, as it is termed, has distinct needs in managing industrial relations.
Many in the last decade have chosen to be independent in the way they handle trade unions and collective bargaining rather than rely, as in the past, on employers' associations and multi employer bargaining.
All multi-divisional companies face dilemmas and choices on the extent to which they seek to centralise or decentralise their operations and how far they try to fit their industrial relations into their strategic plans and organisational structure.
This research focuses on four areas: the role of corporate personnel departments, the link between industrial relations activity and strategic decision making, the evolution and management of management style toward industrial and employee relations, and the control and coordination of collective bargaining and consultation.
Nine multi-divisional companies are studied in depth with interviews conducted at corporate, division and operating unit level.
Executives from the main functional areas (finance, production, personnel and marketing) are being interviewed at these various levels with results fed back to the companies for discussion, and made more generally available through a book, articles and in conferences and seminars.

One response to the rising level of unemployment in recent years has been the growth of Local Employment Development Agencies.
There has been very little attempt to produce an adequate framework for monitoring and evaluating such initiatives.
Most reports simply detail agency structure, contacts, enquiries, number of enterprises worked with, or jobs created.
This research is concerned with the development of an appropriate evaluation methodology for START UP, an agency which has recently been set up in Salford.
The aims of the research are to:
(i)
Identify the existing state of knowledge concerning the origins, expectations and accountability arrangements of comparable agencies.
(ii)
To locate START UP within the range of initiatives, to develop an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of this initiative in comparison to others.
(iii)
To make proposals for the effective monitoring of local employment development agencies.
The principal methods of investigation are the collection and analysis of secondary data, complemented by personal interviews, where necessary.
The final report will be produced under two main headings.
Part One will concentrate on monitoring arrangements for local employment initiatives.
Part Two will contain proposals for START UP monitoring and recommendations for the adequate evaluation of other agencies.

Along with the growing recognition of the importance of design to the success of UK manufacturing both for the domestic and world markets there is a suspicion that all is not well with the state of design in the UK.
Problems would seem to exist on both the supply and demand side of the labour market for designers.
On the supply side both the quantity and quality of designers emerging from design courses may be that good designers are not receiving the recognition in terms of pay, conditions, status etc, required to keep them in the field and/or in the UK.
This study attempts to address some of these questions by looking at the desirability of design as a career.
The results of the questionnaire will provide information on designers' earnings and fringe benefits, employment stability etc.
Using other data sources, such as the New Earnings Survey, the investigator hopes to be able to make comparisons between career profiles of designers and other broadly comparable groups (eg all graduates, engineering graduates etc.)

Tourism and recreation play an increasingly important role in the UK, especially in areas of high unemployment.
Swansea City Council have also been concerned with revitalising a decaying inner urban area based upon the decaying South Dock Area.
To achieve this, a new Marina has been established and extensive residential and commercial development are being undertaken.
Swansea Yacht Haven became operational in December 1982.
Most of its clients reside in South Wales but it was considered that the West Midlands would offer an additional source of berth holders.
A pilot study was undertaken first to identify and locate potential users who resided in the West Midlands and secondly to establish the employment and expenditure impacts of the Marina, Marina-related developments and of boat owners upon the local economy.
Following surveys of Swansea and Lymington Yacht Havens, the study established an ‘idealised’ socio-economic profile of a marina boat owner.
Using a range of computer programmes, this was matched against 831 Census Wards in the West Midlands.
As a result three Census Wards were identified as first order target Wards for a marketing exercise, and seven additional Wards as second order target Wards.
Finally, the study made a preliminary evaluation of the direct and indirect employment and expenditure impacts of Marina construction, development and usage into the local economy.

Employment Agencies, like many other small businesses, have begun to realise that many of their routine office tasks and commercial operations can be handled more efficiently using a business micro-computer.
Word-processing and financial planning have been, until now, the most common applications.
Recent developments in micro-computer technology have not only allowed large storage capacity for data to be made available cheaply, but also greatly enhanced the processing power of these machines.
As a result, powerful database software packages have emerged that can make these small single user machines act like large filing cabinets which can instantaneously search or reorganise a file with literally the touch of a button.
A Swansea company, Unit Inspection-Inspectorate, was recognising inadequacies in their specialised industrial Employment Agency function.
Manual searches of their large and continually growing personnel registers for matches to a customer's specific requirements was becoming uneconomic due to its labour intensity.
Inefficiencies due to human error in conducting these laborious scans for potential applicants was another source for concern regarding the operation.
This firm decided that a computerised database system would possibly aid the operation, but they wanted independent advice on what such a decision would involve.
(a)
The researcher reviews the hardware and software already in existence in some employment agencies, the problems these users have been experiencing, and the mistakes they have made en route.
(b)
Analyses the database software packages available.
There are two broad categories; the one type is available off the peg, supported by large software houses and is designed for general application; the other is tailored specifically for the employment agency market and is naturally more expensive but usually more user friendly since it is written to perform a specific set of operations.

This group then went on to set up the Teifi Valley Economic and Social Regeneration Project (TVESRP), the aim of which was to undertake more projects which would create employment in that part of Dyfed.
This project investigates the possibilities for economic development which were open to this group.
The research was carried out in two stages.
First, an economic and social profile of the Teifi Valley was drawn up.
This involved using existing data and also meetings with representatives from organisations involved in economic development in the valley.
In this way, possible areas for economic development were identified.
Second, analysis was carried out of the existing capabilities of the Management Committee with regard to what might be appropriate economic objectives for them.
The study concluded that the economic prospects for the Teifi Valley are very poor.
It also concluded that the capability of the Management Committee to become further involved in economic ventures are limited.
The obvious area for development was for the group actively to seek Manpower Services Commission monies to set up employment creation projects and to use those funds to establish self-sustaining ventures as certain other projects in the area had done.
However, due to the limited capacities of the Committee it was recommended that the group should concentrate on running the centre more effectively for the time being and to engage management consultants to help it develop the capacity to run more complicated projects.
It was also recommended that the Committee should seek to make some of its existing activities profitable enough to employ a social development director from its own resources.

For many manufacturing firms, costs associated with product distribution represent a major share of the overall cost burden.
Relative savings of only a few percent in this area can therefore mean sizeable savings in absolute terms.
An important factor in this context is the space utilisation in the warehousing and transport system, eg the efficiency with which pallets are loaded or freight containers are packed.
The project consists of two parts:
(a)
A classification of loading problems associated with physical distribution;
(b)
An investigation into approaches and tools which may be of assistance in obtaining satisfactory loading efficiency.
Both these aspects are being tackled by means of a series of case studies and questionnaire surveys.
It is hoped to identify the techniques which have been applied, and the limitations of such approaches.
The work should therefore provide a framework for the further development of Operational Research techniques in this area.

The aim of this project is to design an experimental, micro computer based, management information system suited to the needs of the Chairman of a small but expanding company.
In addition to measuring costs, profits and progress against plans, the Chairman is concerned with potential for expansion and future resource allocations.
The company has reached a stage where the Chairman feels the need for better information and has ideas about how to proceed but would like the involvement of independent academic advice.
The general situation in which he finds himself is not uncommon but little published work has appeared.
Clearly, systems derived from large organisations are not suitable for their purposes but no one knows what is.
The purpose, therefore, is to carry out trials on various ideas and to help the Chairman define his future requirements.

This study attempts to identify the changes that have occurred in South Wales business and industrial structure over the past 20 years, and to determine the effects of these changes on demand for industrial materials handling equipment.
The study is based upon both statistical sources and on a detailed questionnaire, concerned with materials handling activities, this being distributed to a cross section of South Wales Companies.
The statistical sources are primarily based upon VAT data analysis, with additional data being provided from various development agency sources.
They provide a picture of construction, production and wholesale areas as major growth areas on an ‘all Wales’ basis, but the pattern of growth was found to vary markedly at a county level.
Detailed information on company operations is found to be available only from the individual concerns, and in order to determine the types of materials handling undertaken in the region, a detailed questionnaire has been distributed to over 350 companies, and over 150 replies received.
It is clear from the analysis of both statistical sources and from the questionnaire that although there has been a steady decline in larger manufacturing organisations, there has been a corresponding increase in much smaller manufacturing companies.
In addition there has been an increasing proportion of companies concerned with distribution, and with larger retail unit operations.
Most companies, although indicating a preference for locally manufactured equipment, have made extensive use of suppliers from outside Wales, generally because they feel that local suppliers cannot meet their needs.
Despite the downturn in traditional industries, there does appear to be ready markets both in small manufacturing and in distribution and wholesale/retail sectors for equipment providing flexible handling capability for loads (often pallets) up to 1 or 1.5 tonnes.

The ultimate objective of introducing new technology is to improve the efficiency and competitive position of the firm.
Although the use of robots has been widely discussed and implemented in large-scale, large volume industries, their use in small manufacturing processes have common characteristics which would seem to lend themselves to the application of robotic techniques.
By utilising productivity and cost detail provided by the client, this project constructs a priority-index across the range of individual production stages.
Such indices should indicate those stages where the use of robotic-techniques would offer the greatest potential savings and improvements in productivity.
Many of the operations carried out by the sponsor are typical of small-batch operations in large sectors of UK manufacturing and one of the aims of this stage of the research is the derivation of a systematic analysis of production operations in order to gauge the economic potential of fully automated operations.

The contract is for the conduct and analysis of the findings of a survey of one hundred and fifty large private sector enterprises with establishments in the food and drink, engineering, textiles and clothing, distributive trades and financial services sectors.
The aim of the survey, which is being undertaken by Paul Marginson, Paul Edwards, and Keith Sisson (Industrial Relations Research Unit, University of Warwick) together with John Purcell (Templeton College, Oxford) is to add a further dimension to the series of Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys.
The company survey will explore the role of management at divisional and corporate levels of enterprises in constraining and co-ordinating personnel and industrial relations practices and policies in the workplace.
In each case an interview with an establishment manager responsible for personnel and industrial relations will be sought, to be followed up by interviews with managers at one or more higher levels in the enterprise identified as being important in terms of personnel and industrial relations by the establishment respondent.
The establishment questionnaire closely follows the main management questionnaire used in the second Workplace Industrial Relations Survey.
The higher level questionnaires will replicate questions asked at the establishment, particularly those of a judgmental and attitudinal nature.
This will allow issues such as the discretion allowed to lower levels, and different perceptions of the extent of control over or autonomy of establishments to be addressed in the subsequent analysis.
In addition, the role of higher levels in industrial relations policy formation will be explored.

The research examines the fit between promotion aspirations and promotion opportunities achieved as a process of accommodation in the work situation by individuals, groups, organisations and occupations.
The aim of the research is to arrive at an interdisciplinary understanding of particular cases by intensive study over a period of time, using both flexible interviews and questionnaires; and by the incorporation of survey data and through theoretical interpretation to generalise to wider organisational and occupational areas.
In the first instance, the study concentrates on the professions supplementary to medicine employed within the NHS.
The concept of socialisation, and the situational understanding of social action are central to the research.
The need for such longitudinal research into the structure of career opportunities is made pressing by the present and likely future decline in promotion opportunities in the UK.
Information and theory is needed so that people may continue to be motivated, and so that occupations can give the meaningful career development that for most persons is still essential to feelings of self-worth.

The role played by law in structuring and regulating relations between government and industry has only recently attracted the attention of academics working in the field of policy analysis.
At the same time it is argued that the ability of law to order social and political reality has decreased to a surprising extent.
The research surveys current literature on the impact of legal regulation on different aspects of economic activity in Germany and Britain and attempts to develop a perspective from which to evaluate the changing role of law in government and industry relations in both countries.
This involves a comparative survey of the legal framework which governs the implementation of and enforcement of policies affecting industry, with particular reference to competition policy, government aid to industry, and the protection of intellectual property.
The research assesses the impact of European law which might constrain the national policy makers but might also provide industry with a means of challenging national policies which contravene European law.
Later a series of more detailed studies are to examine the way in which particular sectors of industry have been affected by, and in turn have attempted to influence the regulatory framework.
These studies concentrate on industry's attempts to mobilise law to further its own perceived interests, and examine situations where industry has advocated non-legal techniques.
This involves interviews with lawyers working in the companies concerned, interviews with trade associations, as well as with civil servants working in government agencies, central government departments, and with officials in the EC Commission.

The focal point of this project is a comparison of the industrial policy making communities of the UK and West Germany.
The foundry sector has been chosen to provide contrasts with more growth orientated sectors, such as, chemicals and consumer electronics.
A present broad hypothesis is that policy making networks in the UK are more fragmented than in Germany which has led to the development of inconsistent policies, which have not always been effectively implemented.
The UK research will be structured around the responses of organisations to declining foundry output and employment.
Consideration will be given to the 1976-81 Foundries Aid schemes and the 1982 to date Lazards rationalisation schemes.
In contrast to the UK, German industrial policies seem to be more consistent and to evolve from a strong, integrated network of organisations.
The project will attempt to establish evidence on these comparative hypotheses in a traditional and fragmented industrial sector.
To the extent that such hypotheses are confirmed, the project will seek to comment on the origins, impact and persistence of these differences in organisation and approach to industrial policy.

This is an investigation of the way in which firms react to new entry into their markets with special reference to the use of advertising expenditure.
Firms may use advertising to defend their existing position or to signal to potential entrants that incursions will be challenged.
The analysis involves close examination of a sample of markets in which significant entry has occurred.
The response to that entry by the dominant firms via the advertising variable is being modelled using statistical ie econometric methods.
Once these results are available, comparisons will be made in the type and magnitude of the response to entry across the sample.
Economic theory suggests that it will not always be profitable for incumbents to deter entry by increasing advertising expenditure as is the case, for example, when the market is growing rapidly.
The investigation should provide empirical evidence for evaluating such theoretical propositions which have not been previously tested.
The results may also shed some light on the troublesome issue of whether advertising by incumbent firms constitutes a barrier which potential entrants must overcome.

The research is examining the what, why and how of managing strategic and operational changes in firms in mature industries, and any link between the capability to affect change and the maintenance and improvement of competitive performance.
Given the substantial changes in the economic, political, and business environment of large firms over the past two decades, a critical factor affecting the relative competitive position of British firms must be the capability of firms to adjust and adapt to major changes in the environments and thereby improve their competitive performance.
The importance of these adjustment and adaptation processes suggest that the nature of management itself is a crucial aspect of the competitiveness issue.
Part of the management task is to identify and assess changing economic, business, and political conditions, and develop and then implement new strategies to improve the firms' competitive performance.
Such managerial processes of assessment, choice, and change will be studied in eight in depth case studies.
The case studies will have a retrospective and real time component.
The research will be carried out in firms in the automobile, financial services, and publishing industries.

Recent research has shown that proponents and opponents of energy plans often talk past each other with no understanding of the other point of view.
This is particularly worrying at a time when environmental effects, which do not feature in the financial balance sheet of an energy project, are becoming a focus for widespread concern and protest.
This project aims to discover which environmental effects are of most concern to a variety of groups, to incorporate those environmental effects into a microcomputer model for the assessment of energy supply and demand strategies, and to make the model available to those groups with an interest in energy.
The model will be used to explore these energy strategies which might form the basis of acceptable compromises.
In the process, information will be gathered about the ways in which microcomputer based models can help to bring understanding of other points of view than one's own.
This project was part of the Research programme on Environmental issues (award reference WD/06/25/0001)

Formal organisation structures and mechanisms (such as project groups or committees) frequently follow the fashion of the day.
This means that different firms can adopt the same formal organisation trappings but still find themselves managing particular tasks in quite different ways.
The research is concerned with both the trappings of formal organisation structures as well as with the substance of how these are actually managed to achieve specific results.
What is quite new is the indentification of efficient ways for
(i)
organising, and
(ii)
managing all the detailed activities involved in new product development and product updating.
Previous work has focused on one or a small number of these activities, such as idea generation; screening or development work proper.
The results describe and analyse the position in large UK and US firms on the basis of information collected in face-to-face interviews in divisions of firms in four manufacturing sectors: Food and Drink, Chemicals, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Applications of computing and information technologies are often thought to lead to deskilling, unemployment and resistance to change, as well as to radical improvements in productivity and competitiveness.
These effects have been exaggerated, and do not depend on the technology alone.
The consequences of technical change are influenced at least as much as by the objectives that managers seek to achieve in introducing change.
This research will explore how those management objectives are developed and implemented.
The research will first involve case studies over two and a half years in eight organisations from the public and private sectors.
Four ‘paired’ studies will be conducted, allowing us to compare and contrast the use of similar technologies in different settings.
These studies will examine how management decision making processes with respect to technical change effect the experience of work, the role of management, and the organisation's performance.
The case study data will be supplemented by a survey of senior managers in Scottish organisations, to examine their experiences of technical change since 1980 and the implications for the Scottish economy.
The survey will rely on interviews and will focus on investment aims and, the benefits obtained from the application of new technology.

The Economic and Social Research Council launched in early 1985 a major, multi-disciplinary research initiative with the general objective of promoting research which will contribute to a greater understanding of the relatively poor performance of British industry, including the service sector, and which will lead to its improvement.
The research projects were commissioned within the first phase of this initiative.
It is intended to fund a second phase of the programme in late 1986.
Expenditure on the programme will have built up to a minimum of £200,000 a year by 1986/87.
The programme is being coordinated by Mr Arthur Francis, on secondment to ESRC from a senior lectureship in The Management School at Imperial College, London.
His responsibilities include those of assisting in the further development of the programme, monitoring the progress of the individual research projects, and formulating plans for the dissemination of research results.
Requests for further information about the programme should be made to him at the address given at the end of this section.

This project is concerned with local decision-making in trade unions.
It seeks to examine the subject matter and methods of local decision-making, the extent of participation by rank and file members when they are afforded the opportunity and the representativeness of the local decision-makers in terms of the views on trade unionism, militancy and political identification of the rank and file members.
The project includes five workplaces organised by a variety of trade unions, recruiting white collar, skilled and unskilled employees in the public and private sectors.
The workplaces embrace factors such as a closed shop environment, a multi-union situation and a predominantly female labour force.
The project considers the possible determinants of any observed differences between the workplaces in patterns of decision-making, membership participation and leader representation placing them within a broader analytical framework of trade union democracy.

Over the last few years, there has been a considerable amount of interest regarding the role of joint consultation in British Industrial Relations.
Pressure has come from a number of sources in the economic, political, social and legal environment, and there is survey evidence to demonstrate a growth in the number of consultative committees now in operation.
However, rather less is known about the operation of these committees, or the reasons for their introduction or revitalisation.
This research aims to investigate, in detail, activity in a small number of committees which vary in operation and intentions.
Thus, there will be an examination of successful, unsuccessful and recently changed schemes, and this will be based on previous work in this area supported by Lancashire Polytechnic.
The research will address theoretical issues relating to the practice of joint consultation, and its role in the processes of job regulation, as well as contributing to the debates on management strategy and contingency theory.
It will also seek to establish any general principles connected with successful schemes of joint consultation.

The main objective of this research is to discover how, and indeed to what extent, UK firms compete in their home markets.
The primary focus is on the social, as opposed to the economic and technological features of competition.
Measurement will concentrate on managerial perceptions and communication patterns within their own organisations and between organisations in the industries in which they compete.
Managers will be able to report their perceptions of their own organisation, its products, markets, strengths and weaknesses and strategies.
Similarly their perceptions of competitors along similar dimensions will be obtained as well as communication patterns with competitors.
From these data it will be possible to examine the social structure and processes that occur within a particular industry.
Underlying the research is the view that the ways organisations compete are, in part, determined by their views of the world in which they operate.
For example organisations which define their markets differently will behave differently towards them.
The project will comprise studies of three industries in considerable depth.
It is expected that all senior managers in most of the organisations competing in an industry will be interviewed.
Continuing feedback from the researchers to the participants is an important feature of the research.

The objective of this research is to identify relationships between business strategies and the performance of mature UK firms in selected well-established industries facing strong international competition.
The investigators are particularly interested in understanding the potential for differentiation strategies to create defensible competitive advantage.
Systematic evidence from the US (Hall 1980, Hamermesh and Silk 1979, Buzzell and Wiersema 1981) together with observations among British and European firms point to the success of strategies based upon product quality, good design, complementary services, innovation and brand awareness.
The investigators are interested in the extent to which differentiation and focus strategies conflict with cost efficiency and how far new technology (eg flexible, computer-aided manufacturing methods) resolves this conflict.
In terms of the implementation of strategy, the project examines the nature of leadership and of top management, the role of information, the triggers for change, the role of external influences and the political, cognitive and social factors which impede or enable strategic change.

The introduction of information systems into organisations has been fraught with difficulties.
The reactions of clerical and managerial staff can range from non-cooperation to outright sabotage with employees deliberately distorting or destroying such data as time cards or production control information.
There are obvious economic consequences of this problem for firms.
Research in this area has tended to focus either on the technical approach of the systems analyst/designer or the effect of computers on clerical and managerial work, which become ‘de-skilled’.
This has led to a generally narrow perspective where resistance to information systems is dismissed as unreasonable.
But neither labelling patterns of resistance as unreasonable nor believing that managers can be manipulated into acceptance if it is against their interest, are adequate solutions.
It is likely that there are major differences inside firms which will affect the patterns of cooperation and conflict.
More field work studies of systems analysts and how they relate to managers should illuminate this little known area of managerial work.
The central aim of this research, therefore, is to examine the effect of information systems on managers.
Many firms find that the implementation process is not merely complex but that it amplifies strains in the internal politics.
In order to understand the process, the study focuses upon important incidents that subjects can recall or are experiencing.
The data are gathered mainly by intensive interviewing and observation of systems and management staff in ten organisations from the private and public sectors.
The organisations have been selected from both the UK and North America, which allows a valuable comparison to be made across the two cultures.

Profitability and competitiveness; Technology and innovation
The application and exploitation of technical advances is seen as a central feature of competitive performance in industry and is of crucial importance to economic survival and growth.
The research aims to contribute to a greater understanding of the relatively poor performance of British industry in sustaining momentum in the exploitation of technological innovation.
Investigation will centre on the ability of firms not only to understand and react to the markets in which they operate but also to introduce and develop further new products and processes.
The researchers will focus on the development, over approximately twenty years, of a small number of significant technologies, and within these investigate the role of competing firms and the specific environments in which innovations were adopted and improved.
Several methods will be used.
Surveys of technical and marketing journals and reports will be included but a major contribution will be derived from interviews with personnel from participating firms.
In collaboration with foreign research groups, comparative studies of some of the technological areas will also be undertaken.
The work will build on experience gained from an earlier study, project PIPPA, which investigated the post innovation performance of thirty five British firms which had won the Queen's Award for Technological Innovation in 1966 and 1967.

The research concerns one central question: how far do personnel functions, and the assumptions about the employment relation underlying them, affect firms' capacity to innovate.
Separating those pump firms which are most active in the introduction of new products from those that are least active, the project will look for differences in payment and training systems, recruitment, and communication and consultation practices in each category of firm.
Thirty firms will be covered for a broad survey measuring countable innovative characteristics, 16 or more detailed qualitative analysis of the employment system, and the extent to which it conduces, via ‘involvement’, innovation.
A subsidiary study will examine the way firms' 'information appetite' encourages the propensity to innovate.

The ESRC Open Door Scheme is designed to provide access to research for managers, trade unions, public sector organisations and groups, voluntary bodies and other non-academic groups.
The scheme is run by the ESRC Industry and Employment Committee and is confined to problems, and research, on industrial and employment issues.
It provides for these organisations or groups to put forward proposals for academic research.
The research has to be carried out by a researcher in a recognised academic institution (eg university, polytechnic, or independent research institute).
The results have to be published and should not be only of interest to the client group who put forward the proposal.
Through the scheme the client group will be put in touch with a suitable academic researcher if they have not themselves nominated one.
The scheme provides awards of up to £2,000 per project for exploratory or pilot research.
If larger scale work ensues, funding has to be requested through the usual ESRC channels or via another funding agency.
The research on the project is required to be carried out in close co-operation with the client group.
The report at the end of the project is submitted to the ESRC via the client group.
Because of a relatively low level of applications to the Open Door Scheme, the Committee decided to begin a number of regional promotions.
Three have so far taken place covering East Anglia during spring 1984, South Wales, spring 1985 and Scotland in 1986.
In each case the Committee worked in collaboration with academics from the local universities ie University of East Anglia, University College of Swansea, UWIST and the University of Stirling.
A public relations and advertising company was employed to assist with the production of TV and radio commercials and to organise the public relations events.
These activities have resulted in a much higher profile for the scheme and a steady increase in the number of applications and awards.

The Industrial Relations Research Unit was established at the University of Warwick by the Social Science Research Council in 1970: its purpose to undertake research of a large-scale, long-term multidisciplinary character.
In 1984 a new Designated Research Centre was established in its place, retaining the Unit's original name.
Membership of the Unit was also extended to the Industrial Relations Group of the School of Industrial and Business Studies.
The objectives of the Unit as laid out in its constitution are as follows: to undertake industrial relations research of a long-term multidisciplinary character; to contribute towards improving the quality of data and of understanding that is available for industrial relations policy-making by government, employers and trade unions; to provide for a concentration of resources and continuity of work and thereby improve career opportunities for research workers and facilitate large-scale research projects; to enhance the quality of industrial relations teaching and research activity of the School of Industrial and Business Studies; to be a national and international centre for industrial relations research and to attract suitable visiting researchers and research students to the University.
The Unit's current research programme may be divided into a number of broad areas covering one or more research projects.
The division is not watertight since a project may be relevant to more than one area of research and, indeed there are overlapping themes and issues between many of the individual projects.
1 The management of industrial relations
The main focus of the current phase of the Unit's research programme is on management behaviour and its impact on industrial relations.
Several new projects have been launched in recent months and together with ongoing projects are being structured around three major themes: the Management of Collective Bargaining, the Management of Human Resources and the Management of Productivity.
Individual investigations will, where appropriate, draw on a common portfolio of primary case studies as well as a wide range of secondary sources.
They will also use the data from two major surveys which have been funded directly by the ESRC: the survey, for which Paul Edwards is primarily responsible, looking at the place of industrial relations considerations within managerial decision-making in large manufacturing establishments, and the so-called ‘Higher Level Survey’, for which Paul Marginson is responsible, looking at the hitherto neglected area of enterprise-level decision-making in industrial relations.
In more detail, the areas and the associated projects, together with the principal investigators, are as follows:—
(a)
The management of collective bargaining
The major projects under this heading are concerned with the nature and determinants of managements' industrial relations policies in the hundred largest British private corporations (Keith Sisson), management strategy and industrial relations in nationalised industries (Anthony Ferner) and the internal pay policies of large corporations (William Brown and Paul Marginson).
(b)
The management of human resources
Here the main projects are concerned with human resources planning (Keith Sisson), training and development (Ewart Keep) and commitment and involvement (Paul Edwards and Colin Whitston).
Two further projects focus directly on management behaviour as it affects approaches and strategies towards employees.
One is being undertaken by John Storey and is concerned with the attitudes, background and training, and role of senior line managers; the other, which is the responsibility of Peter Armstrong, is investigating the nature, extent and implications of particular functional and professional divisions within British management.
(c)
The management of productivity
The focus of this project, which is being carried out by Peter Nolan and Peter Turnbull, is on the impact of different management structures and strategies on productivity and performance.
It is drawing upon and developing the recent work of Harvard economists in the USA and will use data from some of the case studies which figure in the other projects, as well as econometric analysis at the industry level.
2 Union organisation and collective bargaining
(a)
Officialdom and opposition
This research, which is being carried out by Richard Hyman, examines the historical development of problems of organisation, decision-making and control in British trade unions.
(b)
Government influence on national collective bargaining in the local government sector
This project, which is being carried out by David Winchester, is exploring the ways in which recent changes in central government expenditure planning and financial controls have affected the structure, process, and outcome of national collective bargaining in local authorities.
(c)
The development of white-collar collective bargaining in the 1970s
This project, which is being carried out by Bob Price, examines the development of white-collar collective bargaining in the 1970s with particular reference to the manufacturing sector.
(d)
Union growth
This project, which is being carried out by George Bain is concerned with analysing patterns of union growth at an aggregate level and also at the level of individual occupations and industries.
3 Workplace industrial relations and union organisation in changing economic conditions
(a)
Organisational decline and industrial relations
This project, which is being carried out by Stephanie Tailby and Jean Hartley, is concerned with the consequences for the conduct of industrial relations of organisational decline and restructuring.
(b)
Trade union organisation under changing management strategy
This project, which is being carried out by Michael Terry, is concerned with the development of shop steward organisation under changing economic conditions and management strategies.
4 Law and industrial relations
The major project being undertaken in this area is the ‘Right to Associate in Theory and Practice’, which is financed in part by the Leverhulme Trust.
This project is the responsibility of Roy Lewis and Stephen Evans.

The research is a comparative study of government-industry relations in the British and West German pharmaceutical industries.
It will focus on specific issues of strategic significance to pharmaceutical companies which also have public interest implications prompting the involvement of government.
The issues are in two main clusters, namely the safety and the pricing and procurement of drugs.
The research will examine the interaction and power-dependence relations between the companies and their trade and employer associations, trade unions, public and professional groups, the media, procurement agencies and government at both national and international levels.

The basic aims of the project are to identify the institutional arrangements for accounting regulation in the UK, US, Sweden and Germany, in particular the relationship between agencies that control accountants, accountancy practices and the state.
The project will consider the implications of these differing arrangements for the accountability of these institutions and the consequences for economic efficiency of accounting regulations.
Comparative case studies will be made of the accounting regulations for research and development expenditure and for the translation of currency movements in the accounts of firms.
It is expected that the project will contribute in two important aspects.
First in terms of policy, are there ‘better’ institutional arrangements for accounting regulation than currently exist in the UK?
Are there lessons for self-regulating bodies more generally?
Secondly, in terms of theory, what does the specific case of accounting regulation suggest about the autonomy of the State, the interests it serves, the relationship between power and knowledge and the nature of professions in society.
The methods being used in conducting the project include:
(1)
documentary and historical analysis of the origin and development of the formal institutional arrangements (eg company laws, accounting standard setting bodies, professional institutions) which govern accounting regulation in the UK, US, Germany and Sweden;
(2)
an extensive series of semi-structured interviews of senior members of the accounting profession and its institutions, members of other interested bodies that impinge on accounting (eg civil servants, parliamentarians, lawyers, trade unionists, financiers and industrialists).
These interviews will be concerned with how the formal arrangements operate in practice and the differing perceptions of their efficiency;
(3)
a standardised questionnaire sent to a wider (more representative) sample of accountants and others interested in the development, application, enforcement and impact of accounting regulations;
(4)
an analysis of two accounting regulations (on R & D and currency translation) and the interactions between agencies surrounding the development and change of these regulations.

This research programme concentrates upon a range of policy spheres where the growth of ‘corporatist arrangements’ has been sufficiently conspicuous and sufficiently contentious to have given rise to the term ‘corporatism’with its suggestion of qualitative change in the politico-economic structure.
The projects chosen for support consider a number of issues which include accountability and social and economic efficiency, public and third part accountability, sectional interests and the general interest, and evidence of the efficacy of concertation in macro-economic policy.
These themes are pursued across a range of tripartite associations in differing sectors of the economy, and in a number of countries.
The programme is being followed up by a series of seminars linking the projects thematically (ie training, financial services, and the professions).
It is intended to evaluate the programme in terms of its overall findings, and also the contribution of the research to the understanding of the efficiency of the British economy.

The day to day process of making capital investment decisions in our major corporations allocates the resources of society thereby having a long term impact upon the organizations involved and ultimately upon us all.
It is vital that the best use of scarce resources should occur and that the best possible decisions are made.
Judgement, intuition, and a great deal of ‘soft’ imprecise information is needed yet formal systems often frown upon this.
For instance, managers want to use impressions gained from personal contacts and yet this may not be acceptable within an organisation's culture.
Further, problems also result from political factors; there may be disagreements over goals or outside interests, say governments or unions, trying to impose their own objectives.
But how these decisions are made, for what reasons, and the factors managers take into account in making them, are not well understood.
Conventional economic and accounting theory tends to assume that the process involved is highly rational and orderly.
Organizational behaviour perspectives stress that the process cannot be so calculative when decisions are complex.
To understand what actually happens in these important decisions needs an interdisciplinary approach.
Richard Butler, representing Organizational Analysis, has recently co-authored a book, ‘Top Decisions’,(with D J Hickson and others, Blackwell 1986) based upon a study of strategic decision making in a variety of organizations.
Many of the methods developed in that study will be used to investigate the more specific problem of investment decisions making.
Richard Pike (representing Accounting and Finance) has already researched and published in the area of capital investment decision making.
John Sharp (representing Management Science) has researched in the area of management information systems and brings statistical expertise to the project.
Les Davies (representing Economics), currently completing his PhD at the Management Centre, will join the group as research fellow.
The group will also be linked to other related Canadian research thus giving the project an international perspective.
Interviews with top executives in large private and public corporations will be conducted to develop case studies and structured data amenable to statistical analysis.
Field experiments are also to be conducted to explore the factors that lead executives to accept or reject investment project proposals.
An important question is the degree of congruence amongst decision makers as to the degree to which they are prepared to take risks.
The study is expected to have implications for the design of information systems, for the targets that are set to evaluate investment decisions and for finding ways of correctly assessing risk.
By developing a better understanding of the processes of investment decision making the results will then, through direct intervention by the researchers or by teaching, enable organisations to improve their investment decisions.

This research allows international comparisons to be made concerning the level and quality of all the general support services given by agencies and governments to contractors and consultants of Britain's major competitors.
The main objectives of the research are:
— to explain the degree to which British contractors and consultants are at an advantage or disadvantage compared to the support services available to competitors;
— to examine the extent of collaboration between British contractors, consultants and materials manufacturers in the international construction markets, and identify means through which an enhanced British involvement can be achieved;
— to identify the main impediments to increasing market penetration by British firms and provide recommendations, and — to evaluate any changes in the nature of the competitive process and the product or service required, in line with the development of domestic construction capacity within the main centres of demand.

Telecommunication standards significantly affect the ability of manufacturers and operators to access the telecommunication/information market, the size of the market and determine the extent to which users can have their needs met.
At the European level it is widely believed that common standards will allow an expanded internal market to be developed and thus facilitate the economies of scale considered necessary for effective competition against foreign manufacturers.
The research aims to examine the assumed need for telecommunication standards in Europe as well as the national and international institutions involved in the making of standards.
In addition, the research will for the first time analyse the political processes associated with the determination and issuance of standards through case studies of data communication and ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) standards.
This will allow the mechanisms whereby participants are able to influence the standards making process to be identified, and will facilitate a better understanding of the introduction of national, international and manufacturers' standards.
The principal method of investigation is a survey by questionnaire and interview of large users, administrations and industry participants supplemented by an examination of the deliberations conducted under the auspices of national and international standards institutions.

This project is concerned with the analysis of corporate performance and financial structure.
As computer-based financial information systems develop, there is greater opportunity for financial analysts to draw inferences about a particular firm in the context of its economy or sector.
Accordingly, the study focuses on the cross-sectional properties of some key financial indicators that are constructed from accounting data.
The research should contribute to the development of expert systems used in large-scale monitoring of corporate performance.
The broader aim is to identify approximating models whose application in computer-based financial analysis may provide a useful basis for the inferences drawn by financial analysts.
In this context, an issue of particular interest is the estimation of characteristic values which may be used as ‘benchmarks’ for lending and other financial decisions.
The researchers will address three issues in particular:
i) Given that the frequency distributions of many financial indicators have been found to be non-normal, what other statistical models could provide good approximations?
ii) What can be said about the behaviour of accounting denominator and accounting numerator of a financial ratio and what are the implications for the ratio distribution?
iii) What additional effects will prove to be important in the statistical modelling of corporate financial data and how best can the size of companies and the sector of operations be accounted for?

This project focusses on the extent to which the transferral of industrial ownership between public and private sector has been justified, ex ante and ex post, by political considerations on the one hand an economic considerations on the other.
It further investigates the impact of these changes on management culture and employee relations in a number of privatized companies.
Since 1979 privatisation in Britain has emerged as a significant plank of industrial policy.
It is concerned with reducing the size of the public sector and freeing market forces, and represents an important shift in the ownership of British Industry.
Between 1979 and 1985 some 8 billion of public sector industries were privatised.
In the coming two years sales are targeted to continue at an even faster rate, contributing an extra 9.5 billion to the Exchequer by April 1988.
By this time an estimated 600,000 jobs would have been transferred to the private sector and the nationalised industries share of GDP would have shrunk from 10 to 6.5 per cent.
Privatisation has inflicted three fundamental ‘shocks’ upon traditional public sector industrial relations.
First, by removing entrenched collective bargaining arrangements embodied in nationalisation legislation it has provided management an opportunity to restructure employee relations.
Secondly, by exposing some newly privatised companies to market forces, it has changed the environment in which substantive industrial relations issues are negotiated.
And thirdly, by distributing company stock to employees it has blurred the capital-labour distinction in a number of firms.
The main questions which the project will focus upon are: Has privatisation laid the foundation for longer-term change in employee relations?
In what sense, if at all, have employees benefited from privatisation?
Has the transfer from public to private ownership improved productive efficiency?

This project is an examination of marketing attitudes.
It is being undertaken in 50 small engineering firms with up to 100 employees during the period 1985-1987.
Key personnel have been interviewed using an open unstructured personal questionnaire approach.
Are small firms market conscious?
What is the extent of market research, forecasting, advertising, product development, and exporting?
How effective is pricing, service, and distribution?
To what extent does the economic climate influence marketing decisions?
Interim findings indicate severe marketing weaknesses within the small engineering firm.
This identification of the problems provides the foundation for the solving of these endemic deficiencies.

The clothing industry has experienced severe problems due to competition from the less developed nations (and more recently its EEC partners), and was in deep recession in the early 1970s and again in 1980, since which time its productivity has risen.
In general, the UK garment industry cannot compete with foreign imports on price.
The research therefore aims to investigate alternative strategies which are being adopted in order to compete effectively.
One question which will be examined is to what extent increased computerisation and automation of various aspects of the business might be part of such a strategy.
Strategy in relation to a number of contextual factors--both internal and external to the firms--will come under scrutiny.
The research follows a pilot study carried out in 1985/86 and supported by the ESRC.
The principal methods of investigation will be survey and semi-stuctured interview, culminating in the selection of 24 firms for in-depth study, three of which will be singled out for longitudinal analysis.
Several criteria will be used to select the firms; the idea being to maximise the variety of cases studied.

A number of economists and politicians have recently proposed that British workers be paid wage rates which change with their employers' profitability.
It is claimed that, by making labour costs flexible, such a system would reduce the rate of unemployment and stimulate productivity.
The purpose of the research project is to examine the effects of profit sharing at the microeconomic level.
In particular, it tests (using the nationally representative Workplace Industrial Relations Survey data on British establishments) the hypothesis that profit sharing leads to greater employment growth.
The project also studies the incidence of profit sharing and employee share ownership across the economy.

The research includes a feature whereby six practising professional teachers can be seconded to the project for twelve months from September 1986.
These ‘research associates’ will participate fully in the main fieldwork stages of the investigation.
The research design has been developed after consultation with the DES as well as members of the teaching profession.
Some fresh approach to understanding the management problems in secondary schools could be much needed after the upheavals of 1985/86.
The anticipated products of the research are materials for those running schools to analyse the effectiveness of their organisation and management and find ways in which practice could be improved.
There will also be two books and a series of training courses for head teachers and others with managerial responsibilities in schools.
The research findings will provide practical assistance for teachers in the running of schools.

Recently, much attention has been focused on the notion of a ‘core’ and ‘periphery’workforce as a consequence of attempts by organisations to increase efficiency by adopting flexible manning arrangements.
The objective of this research is to examine the precise reasons for such developments, which include numerical flexibility (part-time work, temporary work, overtime, shift-work and flexible working hours), functional flexibility (varying the range of skills of individual workers), and distancing strategies (sub-contracting work previously undertaken within the organisation).
To this end information is being sought from 51 organisations in Aberdeen, a labour market much affected by the fluctuating activities of the North Sea oil industry.
It is hoped that it may be possible to forecast likely trends over the next five years and their consequences for the labour market.

This study undertakes a comparative evaluation of approaches to the management of performance in a sample of government departments and agencies in one programme area, namely economic development.
The objectives of the research are to increase understanding of the problems and difficulties associated with implementing performance management in a single government policy area which straddles central government, local government and a range of statutory agencies; and to evaluate those changing practices across a spectrum of organisations and thereby to assess the quality of approach in order to disseminate best practice.
The main research issues fall into three principal stages of performance management: setting performance standards and targets; monitoring and review of performance; and decision taking on appropriate alternative policies and organisational and operational arrangements.
Comparisons will be made between organisations and over time, analysing the different structures, procedures and techniques for performance management.
The programme area of economic development has been chosen as suitable for this research approach because of an appropriate spectrum of delivery agencies, common financial and political pressures, wide differences in management structures and approaches between agencies, and major differences in inter-agency relationships with the three main central government departments.
Recent evaluative work undertaken by the Public Sector Management Research Unit from 1979 to 1986 has concentrated upon technical issues of efficiency and effectiveness measurement in economic development programmes.
This should enable the research to distinguish, more clearly than is usual in government, the specific influences of organisational and political variables on management approaches, as opposed to the issue of feasibility.

The aims of this research are to discover what are the attributes, qualities and skills of senior managers (the competencies) that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of high performing systems.
Underlying the work is the belief that beyond all else the competitive achievement of a particular company is a product of the energies and competency of a relatively small group of very senior executives.
The focus of the study, therefore, will be upon ten such groups (some eighty to one hundred senior executives in all) and will be directly concerned with what such people do in what kinds of context and what kinds of competency they display.
The outcome of the study, inter alia, will be the further development of a taxonomy of competencies, a contribution to the enhancement of the language of management activity through the elucidation of sensitizing concepts and the refinement of an understanding of the link between individual performance and organizational achievement.
At a practical level, greater knowledge in this field would mean that more effective action could be taken in selecting, deploying, developing and promoting managers.
In 1984 the Industry and Employment Committee commissioned a report, by G Easton and R Wensley to look at the quality and quantity of research in marketing in the UK.
Following on from the recommendations of the report, a number of projects were commissioned in 1986 within this area which are included within the Competitiveness Initiative.
These are:

The 1984 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey provides an excellent opportunity to review current policies and practices in the field and to study changes which have taken place since the last survey in 1980.
The research project selects information from the survey to study the effects of managerial strategies and structures on trade union activity and industrial conflict.
In particular, it looks at the levels at which key industrial relations decisions and collective agreement are made, the links between managerial strategy and union organisation and industrial conflict, and the changes taking place in strategies and structures employed by managers for industrial relations since 1980.
The main method of study involves a range of statistical techniques.
However, the results of this analysis are interpreted by drawing on qualitative case studies undertaken by the investigator and others in the field.

The long-run decline in the UK's industrial competitiveness is a subject of the highest national concern.
While the causes of this decline are complex and controversial, there is widespread agreement that a vital prerequisite of industrial regeneration will need to be improved: marketing effectiveness at the individual firm level.
This research therefore aims to isolate the better performing UK companies and to examine their marketing activities in order to develop a better understanding of best marketing practice.
It is envisaged that the outcome of the research will be a series of practical guidelines on marketing effectiveness which can be disseminated to the widest possible industrial, commercial and academic audience.
The research will pursue two main avenues of inquiry.
Initially, in-depth personal interviews will be held with a sample of senior marketing executives from a wide range of industries.
These interviews will be followed by a large-scale postal survey of a nationally representative sample of marketing executives.
The research builds upon a previous major survey of UK marketing activity undertaken by the authors (’ Marketing in the UK: A Survey of Current Practice and Performance’, Institute of Marketing, 1984).

Following the publication in 1971, of the Bolton Report, many schemes have been developed to promote the growth of small firms.
Counselling services and loan guarantees are among the better known.
However, such schemes rest on the assumption that the small businessman already has an idea he wishes to develop.
Enquiries at Enterprise Agencies suggest that many people wishing to set up businesses are doing so with redundancy money or for other reasons connected with the difficulty of finding employment and their first need is to find a suitable idea.
At present very little help can be given to such enquirers.
The aims of the research will therefore be to identify and evaluate sources of information and advice which can guide would-be entrepreneurs, and those who advise them, in the right direction.
Gaps in our existing knowledge will be highlighted.
UK government sources will be contacted as well as Enterprise Agencies, Chambers of Commerce, the CBI and others in direct contact with small businessmen.
Existing and potential small businessmen will also be interviewed.
The results of the research will be made available to Enterprise Agencies in the hope that they will be of practical use.

This project is for a one year study into pay determination processes in the UK in manufacturing industry, and in particular to examine the effect of bargaining structure and how this may have changed in the period 1979-1985.
The study examines information from the CBI Pay Databank.
This Databank is unique in several respects:
(1)
It contains data on pay settlements (both on wage and non-wage elements) on bargaining group basis.
Typically 1300-1400 bargaining groups report their settlement each year.
(2)
Databank also contains matched information on bargaining influences on these settlements and how important these are perceived by management involved in the negotiating process.
(3)
Most importantly and uniquely the Databank also contains information on the bargaining structure context for each bargaining group.
This structural information includes measures of horizontal fragmentation (eg number of trade unions involved in each bargaining group) and also vertical fragmentation (eg whether bargaining takes place wholly or in part at national, company, or plant level).
The next stage of the study is to use this survey information to create a perfectly matched sample of bargaining structures data to correspond to the settlement data for each bargaining group for each year in the period 1 August 1979 to 31 July 1985.

This project involves a feasibility study for a longer-scale research proposal described below.
The preparatory work includes definition of the survey sample, development of research methods, and liaison with industry, government and researchers in the field to elaborate research objectives, culminating in a seminar.
The proposed investigation of the human resource dimension of technological change in the Information Technology sector, focusing on how firms manage their changing skill and labour requirements and the industrial relations aspects of the introduction of new products and processes.
This project examines current practices in the firms and their policy implications for human resource managers, technologists, strategic managers and trade unions.
The proposed investigation covers firms producing Information Technology (IT) both equipment and software/systems.
It revolves around a selected sample of detailed case-studies that are located in their sectoral context drawing on statistical and large scale survey data.
The primary, but not exclusive, focus is on Scottish IT firms which make up a localised sample that could be comprehensively surveyed.
This sectoral approach makes it possible to take into account the redistribution of IT production activities between firms that may cut across existing industrial categories (eg between manufacture and scientific services) and its human resource implications.
This project is part of the ‘pre-project’ stage of the New Technologies and the Firm initiative (F/24)

Multinational companies impact upon many interests and individuals as a result of their size, and consequent control over resources, coupled with their ability to shift resources internationally.
The most important single source of information about such companies is the annual report and accounts.
However, many users, and in particular shareholders, financial analysts, employees and trade unions, require and have demanded information in excess of that required by law.
Such calls have also come from supranational bodies, in particular the OECD and the UN.
Typical of such demands are information relating to the countries and business segments the company operates in and especially the performance of each segment, employee policies and employment impact, environmental impacts and company objectives and plans.
It is also known that whilst some companies provide only the minimum information required by law, other companies provide additional information voluntarily.
However, little is known regarding how much information is actually provided voluntarily, whether such information meets the requirements of users of accounts and why it is only some companies which provide such information.
This research examines the disclosure policies of a sample of 100 of the largest 200 UK multinational companies.
It addresses three questions, namely;
1) What voluntary information disclosures are currently provided by these companies?
2) To what extent does such information meet the demands for additional information made by users of accounts?
3) Can the disclosure behaviour of companies be explained by any company specific characteristics?
Of particular importance in explaining the disclosure practices of such companies are the industry a company operates in, its size, profitability, extent of overseas operations and the ways in which it raises finance.
An index of disclosure will be constructed for each company, comprising those voluntary items that are considered, by both users and supranational bodies, as being of prime importance.
The extent that such voluntary information disclosures can be explained by these specific company characteristics will then be explored.

Despite the widespread provision of automatic teller machines (ATMs) which has now been in existence for a number of years, there is an apparent reluctance in the public to adopt this facility wholeheartedly.
This reluctance is summed up in a phenomenon which is referred to as ‘the wall’ viz the limitation of regular ATM usage to 33% or so of account holders.
This study examines the reasons for the existence of the wall.
By means of a national telephone survey, it explores the variables which could be implicated in ATM usage; socio-economic status, cash management styles, practical experiences with ATMs and general acceptance of new technology.

This is a study of the human and management aspects of a large re-equipment project in a factory which makes axles for trucks.
The company is investing 9m to modernize its manufacturing facilities and layout.
This includes new computer-aided design and planning systems, new machines on the shop floor, and changes in the factory layout.
Re-equipment is now in progress, and the purpose of studying it is to see what practical lessons can be learned, which will be of value in future projects.
Earlier research has shown that if projects of this kind are to be successful, management needs to make organisational changes, as well as technical ones.
The focus of the research will therefore be on the specific human and organisational issues that arise during the project; how these issues are decided; what the results of the decisions are; and how they affect the success of the project.
The study will be carried out mainly by interviews with a wide range of the staff affected by the changes, including management, project staff and operators and trade union representatives.
By studying the project as it takes place, the lessons learned in the earlier stages can be taken into account in planning the later stages.
In addition, lessons of wider interest will be published in the appropriate management periodicals.

It is generally acknowledged that, to the extent that British industry is uncompetitive internationally, non-price factors such as the quality of design are at least as important as price factors.
A number of agencies, including Government, are taking action to stimulate high quality design by British manufacturers, and this research aims to contribute to knowledge about how high quality design is achieved.
Its focus is on engineering rather than industrial design, and the management of the engineering design process--a process which spans the initial appreciation of market needs and technological opportunities and the completion of agreed specifications and drawings.
The research will be conducted by means of a limited number of case studies and will include analysis at three levels.
At the strategic level there will be an examination of the role of the marketing, research, design, production, and financial functions in developing the design brief/specification; at the tactical level the issue is that of how designs are developed, and in particular how relations with other functions in the enterprise are handled as decisions get made about more detailed design characteristics.
At the operational level the research focus will be on the way in which the work of the design engineers themselves is organized and managed.
Two themes expected to run through the study are the impact of computer-aided design, draughting, and manufacture on the design process, and the role and status of the professional engineer in Britain at the present time.

The promotion of an improvement in the management of government has been a hallmark of the Conservative Administration since 1979.
This research project will investigate the emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness, specifically the contribution made by developments in accountable management.
The research aims to bring out the character of the efficiency-effectiveness debate and the nature of accountable management as it is being developed through the Financial Management Initiative, the efficiency strategy and associated developments.
The research themes include
(a)
the significance of the contexts in which the different management strategies have emerged,
(b)
the issues and problems encountered in the implementation of systems of accountable management,
(c)
the scope for assessing departmental progress in changing management practice and,
(d)
the broader political and constitutional implications of these changes.
The investigation will draw on bibliographic surveys, interviews with those involved in the design, implementation and conduct of the initiatives, and fieldwork in which the day-to-day operations of the changes will be observed.

The aim of the project is to identify and analyse, in case study form, certain significant contemporary developments that are affecting plant-level industrial relations in the engineering industry.
The case studies will involve a consideration of the process of change--looking at management and trade union policies and tactics; the nature and implications of any agreements; the implications of the changes for wider industrial relations in the plant; the mechanisms for change; and the character and extent of constraints.
The issues around which individual case studies will focus are:
— job flexibility and working practices;
— technological change;
— participation and communication;
— pay restructuring;
— harmonisation and single status;
The choice of these issues is determined by the expected areas of industrial relations change that can be anticipated in the next few years.

The aim of the study is to help a large civil engineering consultancy firm determine their longer term strategy for training their technicians in the use of computers as an aid to design.
The research is exploratory and a causal model is adopted on the assumption that the introduction of computers as an aid to design would change the job content of the technician.
It is argued that the contribution that the technicians make to the industry will be severely limited due to their lack of training in computer aided design.
Traditional opportunities for ‘on-job’ design experience are subsumed by young graduate engineers who are able to use the new design aids.
The study reviews the extent to which computers are used in the industry and the institutional responses to the need for changes in technician training.
A limited survey of 20 FE/HE colleges indicated that the education sector and the professional bodies are not responding to the change and suggests reasons for the slow response.
A study of approaches to technician training in West Germany and the USA was conducted by the civil engineering firm and broad conclusions are included in this report.

This has concentrated on continuous process control and automation as the models of advanced technology.
Where computer systems have been investigated they have been large mainframe systems.
The existing research has also been conducted after the new technology has been installed.
This research will investigate a microcomputer based version of new technology and the implications of proposed changes in the Personnel, Production Control and Materials Management Departments.
It is being conducted at BTR Farington, a large manufacturing company based at Leyland in Lancashire.
The research is being conducted before the new technology is introduced rather than retrospectively.
It is hoped that this research will then provide guidelines in the way that microcomputers can be introduced within an organisation and the expected implications of the proposed changes.
The research could also provide help to companies who want to introduce microcomputers in similar situations to BTR Farington.
The method of investigation will be by interviews with relevant personnel within the company and with computer companies.

Marketing is believed to be an important determinant of industrial competitiveness.
Increasingly it is seen as an important cause of Britain's poor competitive performance.
The research aims to compare the marketing strategies and practices of the Japanese, American and British firms competing in the UK market.
Such a comparison intends to establish whether British companies are generally less effective at marketing than their Japanese and US competitors, and to establish the nature of the differences in strategies, attitudes and organisation, the barriers to more effective marketing and their implications for market performance.
The study also aims to explore how marketing decisions are made and to examine the interface between marketing and other functional departments within the firm.
The results will provide deeper insight into the impact of external constraints and competing functional goals upon the firm's marketing effectiveness.
It is hoped that the study's findings will lead to recommendations on how British companies can improve their marketing effectiveness in a manner that will contribute to a greater level of industrial competitiveness.
This research follows a pilot study, conducted in 1984, supported by the ESRC.
Information will be obtained from personal interviews with senior managers in matched triads of US, Japanese and British companies operating in industries of national significance in terms of size and growth.

Promotion decisions are important in all hierarchical organisations.
In the pursuit of efficiency it is essential to promote the right people to senior positions.
Furthermore, the prospect of promotion is one of the major driving forces behind managerial motivation and if the promotion process works badly, then there can be serious problems.
In the current business climate an increasing number of organisations are having to cope with reduced promotion opportunities, resulting from contraction or stabilisation of the workforce.
Most previous research, predominantly carried out in the USA, focuses on single aspects of the promotion process such as appraisal systems, psychological tests, career development systems, plateauing and sponsor-protege relationships.
The aim of this study is to show how these and other aspects of promotions processes cannot be fully understood except in the context of a particular organisation.
In particular the idea of a ‘promotion culture’ which has to be carefully managed is to be explored.
The research, which builds on a pilot study carried out in 1984, involves a depth case study of a large bank.
The results are of special importance to the host organisation because they are currently developing improved promotion systems.

The four month feasibility study investigated methods of determining the effect of pedestrian flow networks in city centres upon the location of multiple outlets of a single firm--in this case Thornton's chocolates.
Thornton Ltd had noticed that opening of an additional shop did not always increase city-wide turnover, but shared pre-existing turnover between all sites.
In other cases it was apparent that a new pedestrian population was being tapped as turnover rose markedly on shop opening.
This effect was not easily predictable, but seemed to be related to pedestrian trip routes, and the network of pedestrian flows in the city centre.
Several methods of pedestrian flow and journey data collection were considered and 10 pre-Christmas shopping days of automated photographic data were gathered for one street in Nottingham city centre in a pilot study to test collection and interpretation procedures.
7,267 pedestrians were sampled providing information about sex, age, social groups, and time of day.
Analysis of these data together with data from previous city planning pedestrian surveys on other routes enabled the modelling of flows to extract patterns of pedestrian journeys within the centre.
The models can be used to predict circulation patterns within the city and hence enable the retailer to locate new shops on different patterns from those already covered.
The 200 page report on this feasibility study is now available, price 5 plus 1 postage and packing in the UK, from theDE Department of Geography, University of Nottingham, UK.
In addition, the pedestrian data set, computer programs, and bibliography are available on four IBM-PC 360K format floppy disks at 20 the set, plus 1 postage and packing in the UK.

As an occupational group, retail bar staff have a high level of labour turnover which raises problems for their employers in terms of recruitment and training and for the individuals may imply a mixture of low levels of job satisfaction and short term interest in the work.
There is a high proportion of female employees, many part time and temporary workers, unusual shift systems and, particularly since the change in the Scottish Licensing Laws, a significant amount of unsocial hours within the working week.
The aim of the research is to identify the main characteristics of this occupational group as it is represented by the employees of The Alloa Brewery Company's managed pubs and hotels in Scotland.
Attention is focused on the bar workers' previous employment experience, their reasons for choosing bar work, what they identify as positive and negative features of their work and how the job relates, where relevant, to their family commitments and leisure interests.
Data will be collected through a self completed questionnaire distributed to all full and part time employees at a random sample of the Company's managed pubs and hotels.

This project was sponsored by a local enterprise agency, the Stirling Enterprise Park (STEP).
In conjunction with other bodies in the Stirling area, STEP is currently seeking to develop a plan which will ensure that the provision of business support services locally is targeted and coordinated in an effective manner.
The object of the project is to ensure that this plan is founded on a thorough knowledge and understanding of local business development, and of the specific opportunities and constraints operating in Stirling.
In the process, the project should generate an appropriate framework for thinking about the provision of business support services which could in principle be applied to any locality.
The project will comprise a review of pertinent research findings--notably from the study of small businesses, urban geography and regional economics--together with an investigation of specific practical initiatives in the area of local business development.
In addition, all published information related to the business environment and support services in Stirling will be collated and analysed.
It is intended that interim findings will be reported for discussion in venture groups, the results of which will then be integrated into the final report.

Virtually all employers in the British economy face the organisational problem of managing change as a continuous process.
A policy of continuous employee development is one possible solution, if feasible.
The aims of this project are to document those employee development strategies where they exist; and to promote their articulation, where they do not.
The scope of the inquiry includes both the market sector (industry and commerce) and the non-market sector (the health service, local government).
Between 600-1000 contacts are planned: four sample groups at the national level and up to 12 samples of major employers in different kinds of local labour markets throught Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland).
The basic research procedure is a postal inquiry, which will be succeeded by research workshops; at these, the main participants will be those employers actually submitting a response to the inquiry.
Previous application of this method (viz. a 1-stage Delphi with interactive feedback) earlier in this research programme has shown that many employers embarking often for the first time on strategic employment policy-making require some means of obtaining confirmation they are on the right lines.
Such confirmation can be obtained by meeting with other policy-makers, whose views and proposals for future training policies can be directly compared with their own, both on paper and face-to-face.
Hence, although this project will document both what employers do now on training and plan to do over the medium-term future, the inquiry has an intent which is ‘educative’ rather than aiming merely for either purely ‘descriptive’or ‘prescriptive’results.

There is a tendency in commercial organisations to regard the personnel function as being of secondary importance compared to production, finance and marketing.
As a consequence, when there is pressure in other areas, the personnel department may become inadequately resourced.
This inevitably results in the provision of a less than satisfactory service which, of course, confirms the low status and ‘poor’ image of the personnel function amongst other departments and divisions.
The study examines a case where this problem has been identified as requiring attention.
The planned change can be studied as a response to great turbulence in the financial services market place.
Fuelled by the de-regulation, professional mediation and demands for extensions of existing systems of self-regulation, the future for companies in the financial services sector will depend on their adaptability and in particular, their effective use of manpower.
The investigators' case study company is undertaking internal re-organisation precisely in order to enable it to respond quickly to transformations in the market place created by, for example, new investor protection legislation, the government withdrawal from earnings related pensions (SERPS) and increased competition in the intermediary market.
Overall, the efforts to centralise the personnel department are seen as constituting a research site ‘before and after’ investigations can provide fully monitored evidence of the effects of organisational change.

The research will be conducted in evolving product markets in the biotechnology and information technology industries.
The focus is upon the competitive process and the strategies by which companies secure and sustain a differentiated position in circumstances of intense uncertainty and high risk.
The interactions between suppliers and customer firms for such nascent and rapidly changing products are important determinants of the directions and pace of technological developments.
Organisations involved in the creation and adoption of new technology can be viewed as part of a market and technical network and the research
will study these network relationships between firms and the extent to which they affect the competitiveness over time both of suppliers and customers.
The objectives of the research are to evaluate marketing and technological strategies and to monitor over time the dynamics of competitive rivalry and collaboration.
Attention will be paid to the choices made by firms concerning which products to develop, in which market segments to compete, with which customers to collaborate and which sources of technical know-how to utilise in the search for competitive advantage.
The work will extend and build upon current research in telecommunications, videotext and expert systems applied to manufacturing and service sectors of the economy.
Additional information technology product sectors will be studied together with selected areas in the rapidly evolving biotechnology industries.

This project is concerned with the impact of trade union activities on relative wages.
It is based on the 1984 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey and extends work done by the investigators on the 1980 Survey.
Changes in union/non-union relative wages between 1980 and 1984 will be investigated in detail.
The inter-establishment variation in relative wages will be analysed as will be the decomposition of the differential in weekly pay into that in hourly pay and that in the number of hours worked per week.
In addition to the factors considered by the investigators in using the 1980 data, the role of the Marshallion Laws of Derived Demand will be investigated using the information on market structure, product price sensitive, labour cost ratios etc.
The impact of the recent introduction of new micro-technology at the establishment will also be considered.
A detailed longitudinal analysis of the panel of 245 establishments interviewed in both Surveys will be undertaken, concentrating on changes in typical pay.

Selling as a topic has received very little academic study.
The research aims to describe how people sell on the telephone, how they sell successfully, and what factors make certain calls more successful than others.
A number of tele-sales calls made by the sales staff of a local company will be tape-recorded and transcribed.
The systematic features of the calls will be identified and calls made by staff with different levels of success and training will be compared.
The tele-sales training operation of the company will be monitored.
It is hoped eventually to suggest training improvements based upon the analysis of selling skills.
This pilot research will serve as a feasibility study for mounting a larger project on telephone selling.

Seed potatoes represent one of Northern Ireland's most important and consistent agricultural exports to foreign markets.
However there is evidence to indicate that Ulster's share of the world's seed potato market is declining because of a failure to respond to changing customer needs in existing markets, and an inability to penetrate new markets.
The research is focused on developing a suitable model of an export marketing system for Northern Ireland's seed potatoes.
A detailed study of the world's most successful seed potato exporter — the Netherlands — is being undertaken with a view to modelling the Dutch export marketing system, taking account of the different structure and conditions prevailing in Northern Ireland, and the experiences of the Scottish and Irish Republic's industries.

Social divisions in the workplace, symbolised by the provision of separate canteens for different grades of employee, are seen by some employers as counterproductive; they have sought to reduce or eliminate differences of treatment of introducing practices which harmonise the status and conditions of their employees.
The research examines why such policies appear to have developed less in Britain than in many other European countries.
It focuses on attitudes, policies and practices towards harmonisation; the practicality of such policies; and the consequences to be expected from their adoption.
In particular, it asks whether they can be expected to shift significantly ‘us and them’ attitudes and help generate a sense of common purpose in British industry.
To this end it examines critically the assumptions underlying the advocacy of these employment policies.
A series of case studies are being carried out in companies chosen for their different markets, technologies, size and approach to harmonisation.

Over the past 18 years, the Agricultural Training Board has developed an extensive range of services and expertise relating to education and training in agriculture.
Since May 1985, the ATB has had government authority to market its services overseas.
The aim of this pilot study is to assess the market opportunities for the Board's craft skills leaflets and management instruction guides in the developing countries of Africa.
The research will identify those African countries with a strong commitment to agricultural development.
One broadly representative country will be selected from within this group for further study
— whether written leaflets and supporting materials are appropriate to developing countries' needs;
— whether the content and presentation of existing materials are appropriate;
— whether a range of new leaflets and guides dealing with tropical crop husbandry should be developed.
Interviews with personnel experienced in agricultural development and training programmes in the target country will be the principal means of assessing the suitability of the ATB's approach to agricultural education in the Third World.

The last few years have seen many manufacturing companies suffer from recession.
In many cases the consequence has been large scale redundancy, and a reduction in size, or contraction, of the organisation.
The consequence of such contraction is a reduction in the rewards available to employees.
In particular, both pay and promotion, often thought to be the two major motivational incentives for managers, are severely restricted in contracting organisations.
The study is concerned with the work motivation and work performance of managers in a shrinking organisational environment.
It is particularly concerned with investigating how a manager's self concept, or self perception will affect his/her work motivation and reactions to work in this environment.
It is considered that the self concept and the values a manager holds are of central importance in understanding motivation.
By focusing on the self concept, rather than extrinsic motivations such as pay, it is believed that an increased understanding of work motivation in these circumstances will be gained.

This project tests the acceptability of the concept of chemically treating straw among livestock farmers.
Straw is largely seen as a waste product but treatment with caustic soda, ammonia or urea can increase its nutrient content, thereby producing an economical animal feed which could supplement existing hay and silage feed systems.
Through a series of focus group interviews, it is intended that the level of awareness of alternative treatment systems be measured, the obstacles to acceptance of treated straw identified, and the target market for straw treatment systems specified.
In addition to providing commercial information to the company participating in the study, a case research model for testing the acceptability of new product concepts will be developed.
This model will be of relevance to the smaller company and could be used to demonstrate how such companies can profitably engage in product concept testing.

The important role selling plays in the overall marketing process is already well established.
Direct selling in customers' homes is to some extent accepted practice for a number of consumer product groups such as perfumes, cosmetics and toiletries but remains an area of unexplored potential for a number of others.
The value, relevance and potential of this form of marketing is still largely open to question in the UK.
This research seeks to explore, in a chosen area of the country, the merits of this form of marketing by obtaining and analysing the views of the prime participants in this process.
It seeks to investigate sales personnels' and customers' requirements, attitudes and appreciations of direct selling, accepted levels of spend and preferred selling forms.
It will also consider direct sales participants' motivations for involvement, how they were recruited, their aspirations, areas of interest and chances and levels of success.
Based primarily on field research questionnaires amongst personnel employed by an East Anglian company, the research also seeks views on the suitability of this type of operation for products other than those mentioned above: these could be compatible with or unrelated to those already being marketed in this way.

The emergence of the Data Protection Act 1984 gave rise to controversy and one complaint has been the burden that it may cause for small business computer users.
The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the Data Protection Act from the users' point of view, with particular reference to the small business.
Questions to be answered include the level of awareness of the small business of the Act and its requirements, the likely response of small businesses, the impact of the Act on current computer use and procedures, and finally the cost and training requirements for compliance.
The project requires a flexible approach, demanding not only an analysis of the law but an economic and business approach to the nature of the small business and an understanding of small business computer systems.

This project was an exploratory study undertaken into Farm Management Information Systems as currently used by Farmers and the potential development of such systems to incorporate micro-computer technology.
The study was undertaken in the summer of 1985 using a structured interviewing system of a sample group of farmers working in the East Anglian Region.
The study sought to identify existing management systems used by farmers, both small and large farmers operating primarily in the areas of mixed and arable husbandry.
The results of the 19 in-depth Case Studies extracted from the interviews indicate that the micro-computer has a role to play in supporting farm managers and his software needs may be described as being the areas of normal productivity tools plus some system of integrating the information systems used by his advisers into his own farm system.
The project high-lighted the key role of the expert advisors which are used by farm managers in undertaking their roles.

Unlike for many other consumer goods and services, little attention has been paid to the marketing aspect of this software.
It is the intention of this research to explore the issues surrounding the decision to develop software and to understand the marketing decisions (if any) that accompany software development.
vertical and horizontal packages.
The former being concerned with specialist applications (eg lawyers, pharmacists, farmers, etc); the latter with more general applications (eg spreadsheets, data management, wordprocessing, etc).
Vertical packages tend to be of a pioneering nature, whereas horizontal packages tend to result from the development of existing ideas.
In other words, a wordprocessing package may be developed which is faster, easier to use and has more facilities than existing packages; however, the basic concepts remaining unchanged (cf a faster, more fuel-efficient motor car).
This exploratory project examines the marketing procedure undertaken by a number of software houses.
This is related to marketing and systems analysis literature and practice with the aim of establishing deficiencies and proposing future research directions.

This study was carried out on behalf of the Norwich and Norfolk Co-operative Development Agency.
It aimed to gather material on consumer perspectives on shopping, which would provide a basis for advice given to local co-operatives.
The study was carried out in Bowthorpe, a joint Council/Private housing and shopping development located on the outskirts of Norwich.
(Premises are available for co-operatives near to this development).
The major focus of the research was on the large superstore located in the Bowthorpe shopping centre.
The research included a historical account of the debate concerning the provision of shopping in Bowthorpe, interviews with small retailers in the Bowthorpe shopping complex, and a questionnaire survey of shoppers, together with a number of in-depth interviews.

The work undertaken is concentrated on building up a unique collection and source of information on the economy of Norwich and the surrounding area, with particular reference to the changing structure of employment, which will continue to accumulate and grow, after this project is completed, with minimal input.
The data base is to be housed at the Norwich Community Workshop, a co-operative set up to provide a centre for a variety of activities, including research on the local economy.
Data have been obtained from all government and other offices which regularly produce information relating to the local economy.
A file has been opened on each company in Norwich and information collected on a very substantial number of companies, making use of data available at Eastern Counties Newspapers, Norwich Central Library and other sources from press clippings.
A questionnaire concerned with the structure of the labour force, work conditions and health and safety at work has been sent to local branches of every trade union in Norwich and the surrounding area, through the trade union representatives; this survey provides valuable information on employment and conditions of work, as well as on rates of unionisation.
Fact sheets are being prepared on the basis of new information available on company structure and ownership, patterns of unemployment, changing structure of employment, training facilities.

Franchising, as a method of marketing, is well established in the US.
In the UK, it is relatively new but fast growing.
The principal aim of this exploratory research is to gain a better understanding of franchising and the franchising decision.
The research is divided into two complementary parts.
In the first part, a brief explanation of the various forms of franchise operations, in particular the ‘Business Format’ franchise, will be provided and the growth of franchising in the UK will be documented and compared with the situation in the US and Europe.
The theoretical and promotional literature will be surveyed in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of franchising from both the franchiser and franchisee's point of view.
For the franchiser, this means comparing the franchise form of organisation with its alternative, the branch form of organisation.
For the franchisee this means comparing the purchase and operation of a franchise with setting up and running his own business.
The main issues are expected to concern finance (including taxation), risk-sharing, and management.

In 1977, the University Grants Committee decided to fund enhanced engineering courses at eight institutions in the UK.
The main objective of these new degrees was to produce graduates who would be better able to meet the needs of manufacturing industry than graduates from conventional engineering courses.
The aim of this research is to evaluate how far these new courses are meeting their objective and to find out what lessons can be learned from them for engineering education in general.
Using both questionnaire and interview techniques, information is being obtained from staff teaching on the courses, from students and graduates, and from employing companies.
Data are also being collected from a control group drawn from the output of conventional courses.

The research aims to compare and contrast the development of corporate labour policies in three British, three American and three Japanese firms.
These firms are closely matched in terms of industry, size, and complexity.
The project hopes to show the connection between market structure, firm organisation, and the pattern of labour policies.
In addition, it will address itself to the relationship between labour management and performance.
The research follows on a small pilot survey of American corporate archives in 1983 supported by the ESRC.
The main method of investigation will be an examination of company archives, supplemented by secondary materials and interviews.

As part of its programme of research connected with the Second Work-Place Industrial Relations Survey, the ESRC has sponsored the study of up to twelve studies of company industrial relations policies and strategies.
The studies are designed partly to test the validity of information gathered by the current Warwick Industrial Relations Unit survey of company industrial relations policies at one organisational level.
It is often argued that survey data give a very limited analysis of managerial policies which are developed over a period to deal with specific problems and this study should help to test such methodological criticisms.
A second objective of the research is to explore the way that managerial policies are being developed between HQ, divisional management, profit and cost centre management and at the establishment and work-place levels at a time when it is thought that large companies are decentralising their management systems.
Four projects are currently being carried out using the survey

The way in which the government, through the tax and benefit system, affects individuals and companies is something of a mystery to most people.
Over the last century, the number of taxes has mushroomed and the system is now so complex that few understand it fully.
This in turn means that why people do things — work, invest, employ others — which are affected by tax remains something of a mystery.
This project is concerned with the use of large amounts of information on households and companies in order to chart the effects of taxes and benefits.
The researcher has constructed computer models which predict tax and benefit entitlement under the present system, and after any possible reforms.
The researcher intends to use these both to describe the effects of the system and changes to it and to predict individual and company behaviour if things change.
The researcher's work on the effects of taxes on individuals and households draws heavily on the government's Family Expenditure Survey.
This work will be used to examine possible policy changes — to the tax treatment of husband and wife, for example— and has developed new indicators of welfare effects, measures of standard of living, labour supply effects and other responses.
The work is continuing with the development of a new framework for tax incidence, examining the concept of progressivity and investigating the factors which have changed the income distribution over the last 15 years.
The centrepiece of the Corporation Tax project is a computerised model which uses published accounting information as a basis for simulating how much tax individual companies are liable to pay, under the present (and alternative) tax systems.
In the present phase this model is being used to explore the incentives given to companies:
— to distribute or retain profits;
— to invest in different ways; and
— to finance investment using shareholders' funds or by borrowing.
The aim of the project is then to measure how far company behaviour is affected by these incentives.

There has been considerable interest in recent years in the idea of motivating increased labour productivity and improved economic performance through various schemes for workers' participation such as profit-sharing and employee stock-ownership plans.
However, there is little direct evidence as yet on how such schemes actually affect workers' attitudes to the company performance.
There is a research team at the European University Institute who are gathering enterprise level data on the basis of both balance sheets and questionnaires put to workers and managers.
However, though well qualified to collect the data, the team is relatively inexperienced in the crucial tasks of developing questionnaires and compiling the information.
The aim of this project is to provide our Italian colleagues with this expertise, drawing on the combined experience of four British specialists in this field: J Cable, Dr S Estrin, Dr D C Jones, and N Wilson.
In return, the British group will be given full access to the resulting files for their own research.
The arrival of a rigorously constructed Italian data set to match the ones covering the United Kingdom and Germany already in the hands of Cable and Wilson, and France in the hands of Estrin and Jones will facilitate a proper comparative study of the relationship between performance and participation in Western Europe.

Setting standards for the amount and quality of work to be done by employees often does not provide an effective means of controlling their performance.
Monitoring such standards requires supervision which is both costly and frequently highly imperfect.
Even when monitoring can be done effectively, disciplining employees for poor performance is itself costly.
This means that substantial control over work performance rests with employees themselves.
Employers, therefore, have an interest in adopting incentives to encourage good performance even with only limited supervision.
Examples of such incentives are bonus and promotion schemes.
The use of such incentives can have important implications for the internal organisation of firms and for the way labour markets operate.
The aim of the present research is to investigate some of those implications, concentrating on three general areas:
(1)
the employment practices and reward structures adopted by firms;
(2)
the nature of the institutions that are peculiar to labour markets, particularly trade unions and collective bargaining; and
(3)
the resulting levels of wages and employment.
The research will be theoretical but is designed to throw light on important practical issues and, it is hoped, will provide a framework for future empirical research.

The project examines several aspects of the relationship between job turnover and unemployment.
A major objective is to construct a macro) model of labour force turnover and unemployment which incorporates inflexible wages and redundancies.
This model will be used to examine the implications of the Temporary Employment Subsidy (1975-9).
Secondly, a disaggregated study of the effects of unions on wages, redundancies and labour force turnover is being undertaken using both industry and firm level data.
This is intended to shed light on the important question of whether or not unions do increase wage rigidity, and limit the ability of the economy to cope with a decline in product demand.

In recent times, governments have become increasingly aware that the efficient application of new technology strongly influences competitive economic performance.
Most West European governments now attempt to assist and promote technical innovation, particularly in the field of microelectronics and computers, as for example in the Alvey Programme.
However, although the UK government and others have a variety of policies designed to encourage and stimulate innovation, rather little has been done to assess the effectiveness of these measures, or to consider them in a broader context of structural change and adjustment in a mature industrial economy.
This research aims to assess UK policies for technical innovation in this broad context and to compare them with similar policies in other countries.
It will attempt to identify those policies which are likely to be most effective in this and other countries, and thereby to provide an input into technology and economic policy-making.

The Community Support Anti-waste Scheme (CSAWS) was set up in 1976 with the following aims: to promote the recycling of materials; to give support to the government's anti-waste programme; to provide employment for a cross section of the community; and to stimulate industrial, community and charitable organisations to participate in the collection and recycling of waste materials.
To date CSAWS has restricted its activity to the collection and recycling of paper, rags and furniture, the profits from which are shared amongst a wide group of charities.
The study has been designed to look at: the feasibility of extending CSAWS activities to the collection of other recyclable waste materials, such as glass, plastics, oil and metals; potential sites for storage of such materials — sites being evaluated in terms of ease of access, cost, suitability for storage, planning permission, and the availability of funds to offset costs; the number of jobs arising from the resultant expansion of activities; the spin-off effect of recycling waste materials in terms of openings for small business; and the likely savings on current disposal costs in industry.

This project is an intensive study of one rural area, Hay-on-Wye and its surrounding area, to identify the current employment situation, how this situation is likely to develop, what policies are currently being pursued to promote employment, how effective these are and could be and what is the role of private development in the creation of jobs.
The proposing firm owns a number of new ‘nursery’ development units, amongst a range of other activities, and is keen to promote a wide ranging survey of current and future employment needs in the area.
Whilst recognising that such a survey would be of only indirect relevance to their present situation, the firm has a long history in the area (since 1890), and its management has an acute awareness that the present local employment situation is likely to deteriorate further without a mix of public/private initiatives.

Agriculture has a more important role in the Northern Ireland economy than it has in the United Kingdom economy as a whole.
It is the largest industry in the Province, contributing 6% of Gross National Product and accounting for 11% of employment.
Additionally, it generates industry in the food processing sector.
In a region of particularly serious unemployment, its prosperity is especially valued.
However in the last decade, the industry has experienced considerable change and uncertainty related in part to the UK's accession to the EEC and uncertainty continues, hampering forward planning and investment.
This project involves a thorough study of the composition of the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland, and examines the interdependencies which exist within it.
An attempt is made to anticipate developments in EEC agricultural policy, UK agricultural policy, and other economic influences, and then to evaluate the resulting prospects for Northern Ireland agriculture.
Consequently, the project aims to present a view on the medium term future of the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland and to provide guidelines for policy.

The multi-national enterprise (MNE) is back on the political agenda.
This is not, as in the 1960s, due to a fear of foreign (US) industrial domination of European production; but quite the opposite, due to the desire of national governments to attract direct investment by overseas firms, and sometimes in fear of domestic capital and jobs being lost overseas by the activities of UK based MNEs.
The aim of this project is to provide an empirical background to these issues by investigating the effects multi-national activity has on the structure and performance of the domestic economy.
Two distinctive features of the research will be the inclusion of UK based MNEs as well as those based abroad, and the investigation of spillovers onto purely domestic firms.
Following a review and development of the theoretical literature, the empirical work proceeds along two parallel and complementary paths.
First, general patterns and trends in MNE activity and its effects on domestic industrial structure and performance (eg trade, productivity, pricing) is investigated by means of an inter-industry cross-section study.
Secondly, in order to sharpen and help explain the cross-section results, a series of case studies is undertaken within a unified framework.

Over the past few years, banks in the major financial centres have been diversifying into other areas of the financial services industry such as stockbroking, securities underwriting, dealing and insurance.
This development raises important policy issues for bank regulators, in particular because of the possible additional risks to individual institutions and to the banking system as a whole.
The research aims to describe, and to examine the reasons for, the world-wide trend towards financial diversification; to assess the risks involved; and to recommend an appropriate policy response.
Particular emphasis placed on the problems of regulating and supervising financial conglomerates within the existing national regulatory framework.
Countries whose changing financial structure examined are the US, Canada, UK, West Germany, Switzerland, France and Japan.
Interviews are being conducted with bankers, bank regulators and lawyers in the countries concerned.
The research is interdisciplinary, drawing on the law-economics methodology developed by the investigator during his earlier tenure of an SSRC research fellowship in law and economics.

The aims of the project are to develop a small quarterly model of the United Kingdom economy and to use this model to investigate the way in which dynamic specification — the way in which lags in economic behaviour are allowed for — is related to forecasting and simulation properties.
The core of the model is a model of the UK monetary sector, and work on extending the model has focused in modelling the exchange rate, the wage-price mechanism and the public sector borrowing requirement.
The approach to modelling which places emphasis on the relationship between stocks and flows and the ‘error correction mechanism’, in which data innovations are explained by deviations from theoretical steady- state conditions, is used as an underlying principle of dynamic adjustment.
Computer software has been developed for the estimation of large systems of such equations subject to cross-equation restrictions and also subject to changes of regime, so that the model can be permitted to shift in the face of institutional changes (such as the switch to floating exchange rates) while certain underlying behavioural parameters, such as in the desired money velocity function, remain constant.
Theoretical work on the dynamic properties of systems of error correction equations has been undertaken in parallel with the modelling work detailed above.
In the remaining span of the project, it is hoped that further progress will be made in understanding the relationship between these properties and the modelling and estimation techniques which give rise to them.

For many years there has been a considerable amount of interest in the extent to which industrial relations play a significant role in explaining variations in economic performance.
These arguments have assumed increasing significance given the general economic situation and the strategies of the present government.
It has been claimed that high unemployment, recent legislation and changes in the strategies of management have served to weaken the power of trade unions, thereby permitting changes in working practices and work organization which provide a base for improved productivity and performance.
Such arguments have been common not only within the media and political circles, but also within a variety of academic disciplines — economics, industrial relations and sociology.
However, the various academic disciplines have tended to investigate these issues in their own separate ways, with the result that the analyses are typically confined to only particular aspects of the question and thereby remain largely inconclusive.
This project seeks to look at the question of labour regulation and economic performance in a more rigorous manner by undertaking a secondary analysis of the 1980 and 1984 Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys and by incorporating into the analysis additional economic data.
Thereby an attempt will be made by the inter-disciplinary team to integrate and assess the various arguments and claims relating to this important issue.

The entry and exit of firms is central to any discussion of the state of competition in UK markets.
Entry, in particular, brings a force of discipline to bear upon existing firms, and is also frequently an important source of the new ideas which promote dynamism in industries.
This project will analyse a hitherto unavailable data source on new entry and exit in all UK manufacturing industries for the period 1973-1981.
The goal of the project is to examine the causes and consequences of entry and exit in the UK.
The project seeks to chart the speed of reaction by entrants to profitable opportunities, and documents the principal barriers to entry.
Similarly, it seeks to discover how efficient the competitive process is in weeding out relatively inefficient firms.
The consequences of entry and exit will be felt over the course of time in the relevant markets, and it is proposed to trace entry and exit induced developments in market structure and performance over time.
This will enable the investigator to develop models describing aspects of the dynamics of industry evolution.
From a policy point of view, it is hoped to be able to contribute to continuing discussions on the role of industrial policies towards small firms, the diffusion of new ideas and techniques, and competition policy.

The aim of this project is to examine the design of macroeconomic policy in developed Western economies with strong trade and financial link.
The investigators are interested both in the impact a nation's economic performance has on the economies of other nations (‘spillover effects' and in the ‘strategic’ policy responses which such spillovers may induce.)
As the history of tariff wars has shown, neglect of strategic inter-dependence in policy-making led to extremely inefficient outcomes for the economic system as a whole.
In practice, however, the pursuit of national self-interest has been constrained by co-operative agreements.
Under the Bretton Woods system, exchange rates were only to be changed in the face of fundamental disequilibrium, and GATT was designed to restrict the temptation to raise tariffs.
And the European Community is a topical example of regional cooperation in these same fields.
In studying the political economy of policy co-ordination, the plan is to compare and contrast the results of non-cooperative policy formation using computer programmes for policy design,(with the aid of macroeconomic models where feasible).
The project involves active collaboration with other researchers in Britain and in France.

Control over prices and incomes is something which the government may or may not choose to implement in any period.
Most empirical research into the effects of controls proceeds on the basis that the decision is unexpected by those operating within the economic system.
However since controls are imposed to achieve specific policy aims (eg to reduce inflation) it is clear that prices and incomes policies are more likely in some periods (eg when inflation is high) than others.
Consequently it is reasonable to suppose that decision-makers form judgements about the likelihood of controls being imposed and take action to mitigate their effects.
One possibility is that unions and managements make wage bargains which span the (expected) duration of the policy thus avoiding controls on negotiated wages.
The aim of this study is to determine the economic and political factors which cause prices and incomes controls to be imposed and to determine their effects on economic variables taking into acount the possibility that decision-makers make informed guesses about the probability of the onset of controls and thus alter their behaviour from what it would otherwise have been.

Many statistical and econometric methods for the analysis and forecasting of economic time series are available to the empirical researcher.
Computer packages for the implementation of these procedures are widely available, and a body of theoretical results about the properties of the procedures also exists.
The majority of the procedures themselves and of the theoretical results describing their properties rest on certain assumptions.
These assumptions may be valid only as approximations in some cases, and in others may be obviously inappropriate.
The research investigates the consequences of some specific relaxations of these assumptions that are of practical relevance to economic time series analysis.

The research will be centred upon two surveys of small firms helped by Norwich City and Broadland district authorities.
With a mixture of face-to-face interview and telephone approaches, 65 firms are to be surveyed, in order to obtain details of their history and development since being assisted by the council.
These details will then be set alongside the information held within the files of the Industrial Development Officer of each authority.
Building upon the work of Storey and others, the data set obtained from the two surveys will allow the identification of the contribution made by the financial assistance of each authority to the success and development of the local companies.
The original proposal documents from the firms offer key accounting variables.
The survey will also investigate sources of advice (such as the enterprise trust, banks, and customers and suppliers).
The study builds upon four recent small studies of the Norwich economy, financed under the ESRC Open Door Scheme, and undertaken from the University of East Anglia: by Moseley on unemployment, by Sapsford on the local government provision of sites and premises, by Seddon on the building up of an industrial data base, and by Townroe on the employment of 16 and 17 year old school leavers.
One output of the study will be suggestions for improved record keepin and monitoring procedures for the two authorities.
The central output will be two case studies of economic development policy in contrasting district councils, together with an assessment of the impact, at the margin, of the public financial assistance to approximatley two hundred non-Development Area small industrial businesses.

The interest rates and prices of financial assets are generally recognised to have a pervasive influence in the economy.
Many of these prices are established in organised markets (such as the stock exchange) which, in recent years, have been freed of a number of restrictions on their activities.
Increasingly therefore, financial asset prices are being set in free markets by the forces of supply and demand.

Most decisions made by individuals, organisations and administrators involve some degree of risk or uncertainty about the outcome, and it is therefore important for social scientists to be able to understand, explain and predict behaviour when risk and uncertainty is involved.
A growing body of experimental evidence has raised doubts about conventional explanations; but that evidence in its turn has been criticised on the grounds that much of it:
(a)
is based on small samples, often made up of students/staff in full-time higher education, and,
(b)
involves hypothetical rather than real choices.
The research conducts experimental work with more than 600 participants, of whom more than 500 are not in category
(a)
.
Most of the participants are paid (or not) according to the choices they made, combined with an element of pure chance, while a sub-sample of over 100 answer hypothetically.
The purpose is not simply to replicate earlier experiments but to provide new evidence which will help to discriminate between alternative theories and provide insights about the ways in which our understanding of choice under uncertainty might be improved.
A considerable body of data, including interviews with participants, have now been collected.

The Employment Research Centre has no view of its own on the root causes of unemployment but it is convinced that the problem of unemployment can be solved.
A great deal of research on the problem has already been carried out here and abroad but the findings are rarely understood even in Whitehall.
One of the tasks that the Employment Research Centre is undertaking is to publicise these findings in language accessible to ordinary members of the public.
Another task is to initiate research of particular relevance to policy issues and to examine existing and proposal policy initiatives on employment.
Apart from publishing a series of commissioned pamphlets, the Centre plans to produce an Unemployment Fact Sheet in deliberate imitation of the Fact Sheets produced by the Family Policy Studies Centre.
The aim of this Fact Sheet is to provide the minimum necessary background data on unemployment in Britain for a rational debate on causes and remedies.
This Fact Sheet will be followed by a series of Briefing Papers for MPs, which will go beyond the facts to a description of the types of arguments that have been employed by researchers to study the causes of unemployment, including the possible effects so far as they are known of various remedies that have been proposed.
The entire programme of work is to be capped by a report addressed to the government summing up what we now know about unemployment and reviewing the feasible policy proposals likely to solve the unemployment problem in Britain.

An increasing amount of research into international economic issues requires the use of trade statistics.
These, however, are often difficult to find in the form required, because of inconsistencies in definitions or reporting standards.
The object of this research is to construct an international trade database that can readily be used by the academic community in the UK.
The database has extensive disaggregation by country, distinguishes fourteen commodity groups and covers a twenty year span of data.
In order to simplify access to the data, a set of computer programs enables prospective users of the data not only to obtain data, but to tailor their excerpts from the database precisely to their own requirements.
Once the database is fully operational, it will be transferred to the ESRC Data Archive, and will also be accessible direct from Cambridge.

Since the mid 1950s population and manufacturing industries have been leaving our larger towns and cities in favour of smaller towns and rural areas.
This relative decline of the cities, which has come to be known as ‘urban-rural shift’ has contributed to inner city economic and social problems.
Policies which encouraged this dispersal, such as new town and overspill policies, were recently reversed in an attempt to regenerate the local economies of urban areas.
At the same time traditional regional industrial policies which aim to help the economies of traditionally depressed regions have been reduced in scale and are now restricted mainly to the older urban areas of Clydeside, Tyneside, Humberside, Merseyside and South Wales.
In spite of expenditure cuts, urban and regional policies combined absorb about £1,000 million of Exchequer expenditure.
The research will use statistical analysis to disentangle the impact of ‘urban-rural shift’ from the impact of urban policies and of regional policies in conditions where all three are influencing the major cities simultaneously.
The overall objective is to measure the cost effectiveness of urban and regional policies and to monitor recent changes in urban and rural economic activity which have important implications for local planning and housing policies.

Despite the contraction in its employment, Britain's manufacturing industry has been increasing its requirements for factory floorspace.
However, it is not clear that existing mechanisms ensure that the right quantity of floorspace is available in the right place at the right time.
There is increasing evidence that shortcomings in the industrial building stock are an obstacle to better national economic performance.
This study, which extends previous work by the research team, investigates these issues in two stages.
The first is an analysis of the relationship between the national economy and the industrial property market in different parts of the country, and the second an interview survey looking at the influence of premises on firms' growth, efficiency and corporate strategies.
Use is being made of an existing large databank on individual factory premises.
The results will assist the formulation of policy on the provision of factory floorspace.

There is widespread concern in Britain over many aspects of forest policy and management in both public and private sectors of the industry.
Since half of all British woods are in private ownership, the achievement of national policy goals depends, to a large extent, on decisions taken by private landowners.
Successive governments over many decades have sought to influence those decisions, partly by offering a variety of fiscal incentives, mainly in the form of tax reliefs or direct grant aid.
The central purpose of the research is to examine the impact of various fiscal measures upon the extent and management of private woodlands.
How far have woodland owners' decisions been influenced by these measures?
What would be the likely consequences of specific changes in the current set of fiscal measures affecting forestry?
The object of the study is to provide some answers to such questions and to identify specific measures which might assist in the achievement of certain national goals, such as preventing further loss of broadleaved woods.
The study involves surveys of samples of woodland estates and farms in many parts of England and Wales, including an area on the edge of London.
The emphasis in the surveys is on the landowners' attitudes towards forestry, their responses to existing fiscal measures and the kinds of measures which might lead to landscape improvement and increased opportunities for public enjoyment.

There have been significant changes in the UK economy over the last twenty years, with a steady growth of the service sector at the expense of industry.
These changes have implications for the location of economic activity, and, in particular, call into question the economic role of cities.
Most cities reached their present size by being centres of manufacturing production.
Now, however, the majority of manufacturing firms seek locations in smaller towns where space is more abundant, with the result that the role of cities has become increasingly that of centres for service sector activities.
The object of the research is to examine the effects of structural change in the national economy on economic activity in different types of cities.
This includes not only documenting the sectoral pattern of activity in cities, but also an appraisal of the consequences in terms of job opportunities for different groups within the economically active population.
In addition, the research is expected to shed light on the social consequences of cities' changing economic roles.

A strong cycle of alternating booms and slumps has affected all types of residential, industrial and commercial development in Britain in the post-war period.
This cycle causes considerable market uncertainty affecting the occupiers, developers, investors and planners involved in new building.
This project extends previous research on the office development cycle to investigate all sectors of building and construction in the UK during the post-war period.
An initial empirical analysis of national data series isolates and compares the cycles in different sectors.
The relationships between building cycles and selected market supply and demand side factors such as interest rates are then modelled.
Finally, the effect of the cycle upon metropolitan development, and the interaction with planning policy, is investigated using available data for Greater London as a case study.
In the final report, special emphasis is laid upon the implications of the analysis for urban development prospects and policies in the 1980s, covering issues such as inner city regeneration, the current slump in housebuilding, and over-supply in the office and industrial markets.

Youth unemployment rates vary widely between different areas of large cities.
The level of youth unemployment in an area may reflect the characteristics either of the area itself (eg the absence of expanding industry) or of the young people who live there (eg their educational qualifications), or some combination of the two.
This research aims to determine the relative importance of ‘area’ and ‘personal’characteristics in explaining local variations in school-leaver employment and unemployment within Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1981.
The 1981 decennial census provides information on the social and economic characteristics of small areas of these cities.
The ESRC-funded 1981 Scottish School Leavers Survey provides data on the personal characteristics of young job-seekers in these areas and on the employment, if any, that they found.
The research uses these two sources of data to explain local variations within each city in school-leaver unemployment and in the type of employment obtained.
It is hoped that the research will help governments to choose the appropriate mix of manpower and area-oriented policies.

This study examines the role of the managerial labour market in facilitating the growth of small firms.
It will focus upon the procedures used by growing smaller firms to recruit managers, contrasting these with more traditional small firms.
The first stage of the study is to identify a sample of 100 firms which reached the Unlisted Securities Market (USM) within 10 years of starting.
The financial performances of these firms is then compared with an otherwise matched sample of small firms.
The second stage is a set of interviews with those managing the fast growth businesses to investigate the process of managerial recruitment.
It is hoped that the results could be fed directly into the planning of managerial training programmes for smaller businesses.

The project has an especial significance at this time because of the impending changes in the legislation governing the operations of the building societies in Britain.
It involves a comparative study of recent developments in mortgage finance in Britain, the USA, Denmark and the Netherlands.
It is linked to a further project, supported by the Anglo-German Foundation, which is examining changes in the arrangements of the mortgage finance in West Germany.

For many years radio has been the ‘poor relation’ of the media, attracting far less attention than, for instance, television or the newspapers.
Nevertheless, recent research has drawn attention to the advantages of radio as a cost-effective and efficient means of communicating with particular audiences.
Given the revival of interest in local radio and the fact that this is occurring within a general context of economic and financial difficulty in the country as a whole, it is rather surprising that so little attention has been paid to the potential role of radio in contributing to local economic development.
The core of this research will be a questionnaire survey covering 30 businesses and 5 local training providers in the market area covered by Radio Tay.
It will investigate the use of local radio as a source of business related information by employers.
It will include an investigation of the extent to which the workforce can stimulate employer interest by bringing possibilities to their attention through formal or informal consultation.
This research is a pilot study.

Adam Smith and subsequent writers have shown that in a competitive economy the pursuit of self interest can lead to an outcome which society would view as efficient.
The majority of such theories are concerned only with those economies in which money does not play an essential role.
This project aims to discover whether similar results can be established for an economy in which money has a more significant function.
This project is concerned with fundamental problems in the theory of money.
For instance— why do people choose to hold money when there are alternatives such as interest bearing bonds?
An unsolved problem in this area which has important implications for government policy is precisely what costs does inflation impose on the economy?
Are the costs of inflation greater than the costs of curing inflation?

This project is part of the ‘Design and Non-Price Competitiveness’ Phase of the ESRC Initiative.
The aim of the research is to explore how design improvements can enhance the market performance of British products.
The research starts from the assumption that it is a product's competitive edge rather than its design per se that determines its performance.
Accordingly, the first stage of the study is to measure the competitive edge of British products in a range of industrial and consumer goods markets, and see how these can change as designs changes.
This analysis will use recently developed techniques for measuring the competitiveness of a product amongst a group of similar competing products.
These techniques can show how the implications of a design improvement will depend on whether the product is already the best, or comparatively mediocre, and can also compare the effects of design and price changes on competitive edge.
The second stage of the study is to correlate these changes in competitive edge with changes in market performance, while taking due account of other factors influencing market performance.
The study will concentrate on competitiveness in domestic product markets, using trade press surveys of available products and their specifications, and trade source estimates of market shares.

The research continues our work on the development of the LBS model of the UK Economy.
We shall extend our research into factors affecting the supply side of the economy.
We shall continue to develop our model of the labour market.
We shall also study company sector decisions in relation to capital spending and personal sector decisions in relation to savings.
The two are linked through the cost of capital and the return on financial assets.
We shall investigate the determination of prices with explicit allowance for both supply and demand factors.
In particular we shall study the prices of exports of manufactured goods and the price of manufactured output supplied to the domestic market.
We shall also model supply decisions for these markets.
We shall extend this approach to the non-manufacturing sector.
We shall develop our previous work in the financial sector to improve the estimation of the current model, and to produce balance sheets for the public and private sectors.
We shall be extending our research on the design of economic policy to consider how to make policy more robust, to allow for different degrees of credibility and to include the effects of incomplete knowledge about the economy and the intentions of the Government.

Research summary: During the two year period for which this project was funded some 185,000 valuations have been gathered from nearly 17,000 probate inventories for the counties of Hertfordshire, Worcestershire, Lincolnshire, and Durham over the period 1550 — 1750.
These have been used to calculate continuous price series for 50 individual items based on 10 year average prices.
Intermittent series based on 50 year averages have also been calculated for another 50 items, and a large number of individual valuations for items which occur only rarely have also been collected.
These series are being grouped together to provide a set of price indices for agricultural, industrial and consumer prices.
While complete series are available for Hertfordshire, Worcestershire and Lincolnshire, staffing changes on the project meant that only 50 years of data could be collected for Durham.
Price series will be made available to other historians through the data archive at Essex and also through publication, although the raw inventory data will only be available when the inventory computer package is made machine-independent.
In general terms the price series produced follow one of three trends.
All rise from 1550 to 1650 in line with the general inflationary trend in the economy, but thereafter they diverge.
As population pressure slackened after 1650 many series stay roughly constant, which conforms with the trend already witnessed in other series.
However, some prices continue rising, particularly for foodstuffs such as bacon.
Most domestic items, particularly those made of wood show a dramatic fall after the mid-seventeenth century.
This is a completely new finding which suggests that fundamental changes were taking place in the nature of the early modern economy.
The nature of these changes await further investigation but a possibility is that increased consumption of domestic items was leading to a fall in their.
The computer methodology for probate inventories has been further developed so that it can now handle large numbers of complete inventories.
Once this software is rewritten in a machine-independent form the way is open for the compilation of a national database of probate inventories which could be used to investigate a wide range of economic and social issues in early modern England.

Until comparatively recently, bargaining was a subject on which economic theory had very little to say.
It was therefore necessary to treat, for example, labour markets in much the same way as the market for perishable fruit.
However, in the last few years, strategic ideas, borrowed from Von Neumann and Morgenstern's theory of games, have been brought to bear on bargaining questions.
The theorems indicate that the results to be expected from bargaining sessions depend heavily on the institutions which govern the manner in which the bargaining takes place.
The current project is an attempt to study actual bargaining behaviour in artificially simplified bargaining environments in the laboratory to test whether the game-theoretic approach is genuinely viable.

In the analysis of regions, researchers have tended to deal separately with a region's economy and with its population.
The relationships between these two components have often been modelled almost as an afterthought, and are frequently represented in an inconsistent fashion.
This project is intended to develop a series of regional models which integrate the economic and demographic systems consistently, and to test these models with real data.
The models will be based on extensions to the Leontief input-output model, and will pay explicit attention to the relationships between labour demand and supply, unemployment, social security payments and industrial output.
One particular advantage of models such as these is that they can be used to produce multipliers which show the effects of changes in eg the population of a region on the employment levels in that region.
They can also be used to model the effects of changes in social security payments on industrial outputs, and hence to demonstrate the effects of policy decisions on such payments in terms of changes in unemployment levels.
Using data for a selection of metropolitan regions, the models will be tested for feasibility, accuracy and sensitivity.

‘Stagflation’ implies a state of affairs in which the economy is both stagnant (with abnormally heavy unemployment) and inflationary (with a rapid rate of rise on money prices).
The problem is how to conduct economic policy so as to reconcile full employment and price stability.
One possibility is to conduct monetary and budgetary policies in such a way as to maintain a steadily expanding flow of total money expenditure on the products of labour, and so on labour itself.
If the total flow of money available to finance wages and salaries were rising, at a steady but moderate rate (say, 5 per cent per annum), both unemployment and inflationary rises of prices and costs could be avoided, provided that money wage rates themselves were not allowed to rise at inappropriately high rates.
The purpose of this study is to examine, not the political acceptability, but the administrative and institutional feasibility of operating a combination of
(i)
financial policies to maintain a steady and moderate rate of growth of total money expenditures and of
(ii)
wage fixing arrangements which pay due regard to the effect of wage rates on the level of employment in each sector of the economy.

Care of the natural environment remains a matter of great social concern.
This is witnessed by the growing number of people with membership of various conservation societies and in recent major international documents such as The World Conservation Strategy, the Global Possible, the consensus at the Second International Conference on Population and, within the USA, Global 2000.
One of the themes of the ‘new environmentalism’ is that of sustainability.
Its interpretation is vague, having some specific interpretations in the context of renewable resources such as fisheries, wildlife and forestry, and more general, philosophic and political implications.
In only a limited respect have economic concepts of sustainability been invoked in the literature.
This research project aims to look at the philosophical basis for the new 1980s environmentalism with special reference to economic concepts of sustainability familiar to resource and environmental economists.
While largely discursive, the project seeks to adapt and extend existing economic models of resource use against the background of what appears to be a changed environmentalist outlook.

Economic circumstances, particularly women's employment, are related to family formation and dissolution both as cause and effect.
This programme develops attempts to quantify these processes.
It also seeks to measure the distributional implications of demographic changes.
Here are examples of questions addressed.
How do different patterns of marriage and childbearing affect women's subsequent incomes and pension rights?
How much are a person's chances of survival, reproduction or co-residence with others affected by their command over economic resources?
How have income difference between men and women been changing?
How sensitive are the answers to varying assumptions about how families pool resources?
Is poverty in Britain becoming more or less ‘feminized’?
Existing survey data is used to estimate responses between demographic and economic factors and also to summarize changes in various descriptions of economic inequality in successive cross-sectional household surveys in Britain.
The lifetime perspective is extended by building simulation models of individual and family income over time.
To see how far contrasts in the institutions of two different welfare states are reflected in patterns of employment and family building, collaborators in Sweden are running parallel analyses of the event histories of Swedish women.

Recent years have witnessed substantial changes in the methods employed to regulate transport and, in particular, have seen the gradual abandonment of direct entry controls.
This small-scale study aims to look at the impacts of deregulation of passenger transport in the United States and to examine the way that transport suppliers have responded to the new environment.
The study will involve interviews and discussions with those actually involved in the provision of transport services with the intention of assessing the qualitative effects of deregulation and thus provide additional insights to supplement the quantitative work that has been conducted to date.
Additionally, some effort will be made to assess the impact of the change on the approaches adopted by managers of passenger transport undertakings.

This is the first joint Fellowship established with natural scientists and ecologists from NERC.
The principal focus will be on the Common Agricultural Policy, and its effects in areas of environmental sensitivity including the uplands.
In recent years the CAP has been attacked in popular publications for encouraging the loss of landscape features and habitats.
The aim is to isolate the realistic changes in CAP which could be environmentally helpful, and model consequent changes in land use and employment.
Sampling of farms is likely to follow a national land classification system developed by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology at Merlewood.

This involves research on farming practice in the north east of England which will supplement existing work by the author on East Anglia.
These two areas will be case-studies in the second project which is a preliminary investigation into the transformation of ‘regional economies’ in England from 1500-1900 and their integration into a ‘national economy’.

Recent years have seen an increased public concern and interest in issues of defence, disarmament and peace.
These are world-wide concerns — eg US-USSR summits; nuclear weapons; Star Wars; INF treaty.
This increased public concern has highlighted the need for greater information and understanding of these issues.
Since 1960, there has been a substantial expansion of economics literature in the field.
There is now a need for a survey of the current literature which will be invaluable to policy-makers, politicians, teachers, researchers and students and which will embrace the various schools of thought (eg defence and peace economics).
Defence is a major user of scarce resources, involving issues vital to our survival — and yet it is a relatively under-researched field.
The Annotated Bibliography will meet three sets of needs: i.
It will provide a research tool to assist the further development and understanding of all aspects of defence, disarmament and peace It will identify gaps in research and areas for further study.
ii.
It will provide a teaching aid to direct teachers to current studies and to indicate the principal areas of concern as shown by the balance of topics covered in the published literature.
iii.
It will provide a guide to current knowledge and the state of the art which will be invaluable to policy makers and practitioners
(eg governments, military staffs).
All aspects of the subject will be annotated, namely, micro and macro- economics, international trade, developing countries, industry, public sector economics and public choice, the arms race, disarmament and conversion.
The focus is on the economics literature published in English.
The Bibliography will be published by Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.

The object is to look at the growth experience of the United Kingdom over the last 80 years or so as a whole — which strangely enough has not yet been examined.
This should throw much light on the way the economy responds to outside shocks, and on some fundamental issues underlying everyday economic policy.
The year 1973 marks a watershed in postwar UK experience, as for most other industrial countries.
Before that there was (historically) fast growth and low unemployment.
After that, growth was relatively slow up to 1981 — during which period high unemployment built up; and then again faster — despite which unemployment, though now failing, has remained high.
Thus 1973 marks a major setback from which there has been still-incomplete recovery.
The thesis that the shock was initially due to a lack of demand has perhaps had less acceptance than a supply- side line of explanation, eg that high unemployment has been due to excessive wage levels.
But that line appears rather less plausible (in reverse) as an explanation of fast growth/high employment in 1945-73.
By studying the two postwar phases together, and the interwar period, it is hoped to produce firmer-based explanations applicable to the whole period.
Selected episodes in other countries will be looked at where relevant.
It is hoped that a detailed study of this sort of one country will make its contribution to the general understanding of economic growth, now a topic of growing interest.
On many topics, the study will continue (or supplement) themes treated in my previous book, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY (1964).

The International Economics Study Group provides a forum for the promotion, discussion, and dissemination of academic and policy oriented research in international economics.
This is a forum in which new entrants to the profession can interact with senior academics, distinguished visitors from overseas, and international economists working in government, finance, and international institutions.
It is the objective of the IESG to maintain its role in enhancing the intellectual vitality of the UK academic community concerned with international economics, and to keep the academic community in contact with the policy making community.
The IESG has a membership of about three hundred persons.
These are mainly academic staff and some research students of UK universities and polytechnics, but practitioners in government, international institutions, and business and finance are well represented, as are overseas academics.
New members join by requesting to participate or to be put on the mailing list.
The Group holds afternoon meetings in London once a term.
It holds an overnight conference during the Easter vacation.
The annual conference is held in September on a particular theme, and attracts participants of high international standing.
In 1992 the Conference will be on the theme: ‘International Investment’.

Economic models may be estimated in a variety of ways.
In the first part of this project, the researchers intend to investigate how the choice of estimation method affects statistics used to test assumptions about such models.
The relibility of test statistics calculated using various techniques will be examined using computer simulation experiments.
The second part of the project will involve an assessment of the usefulness of statistical tests in deciding how to reformulate or reestimate an economic model that has been found to be inadequate.
This research will include an evaluation of procedures designed to discrimate between different possible causes of model inadequacy.

A change in Accounting Standard SSAP 13, which will come into effect in March 1990, allows examination of this problem.
Under the new Standard, a company will have to disclose R & D expenditure as a separate item in their published accounts.
The effect of this disclosure on the stock market valuation of a company will be investigated.

The NIESR has published two histories of economic policy in Britain, that by J C R Dow on the period 1945 to 1960, and that by F T Blackaby and others on the period 1960 to 1974.
A new volume is now being prepared to cover macroeconomic policy over the period 1974 to 1987.
The grant will finance the statistical and econometric work required for this new study.
Its aim is to provide fresh evidence and new insights into the way policy was conducted, and its effects on the economy.
One part of the study is concerned to describe and interpret the way in which policy instruments such as interest rates of taxation were actually used.
The aim is to discover, for example by estimating ‘reaction functions’ what were the economic indicators to which policymakers in fact responded.
The findings can be compared with the way in which policy actions were described at the time, and one sub- period can be compared with another.
The other main aim is to estimate the effects of macroeconomic policy on the delelopment of the economy over this period, especially with regard to unemployment, inflation and the rate of growth of output.

This study builds on the work of an existing paper (to be published in the Economic Journal in March, 1989) which argued that, during the 1980's the export performance of the UK manufacturing sector improved to the extent that the historical decline of the sector's share in the world total had been arrested.
It was argued that, following the 1980- 1981 ‘shake out’ of inefficient producers, the composition of UK exports moved away from‘necessity’goods (the demand for which tends to grow slowly as world income grows), towards ‘luxuries’, whose demand grows relatively fast.
However, in a world characterised by producers battling for market share, a relative improvement in one country's export performance (as measured by growth in its world market share) must be reflected in another's deterioration.
Although changes in performance arise as a result of supply side factors, they manifest themselves as shifts in demand curve.
By analysing these shifts, using econometrically estimated demand curves, it is hoped to identify which countries have improved since 1970, and those that have suffered as a result.
A further analysis using data disaggregated by type of good will be carried out to try and identify where these shifts originated.

In the present climate of successful superpower arms limitation talks it is likely that there will be substantial changes if not in the level of military budgets, in their composition.
This comes at a time when many advanced economies are undergoing profound structural change, with technological change, the growth in importance of the service sector and the growing internationalisation of production.
In such a situation it becomes crucial to understand the economic effects of changes in defence budgets are likely to be.
The aim of this project is to provide this much needed information focussing on the employment effects, a particularly important aspect in these times of relatively high unemployment, as well as a matter of considerable controversy.
It will provide a systematic analysis of the issues involved in three ways.
Firstly, by providing a comprehensive critical review of the available empirical studies, an important task in an area of such controversy and diversity.
Secondly, by a substantive statistical cross country analysis for the OECD, linking the work in the defence economics literature to developments in the labour economics literature.
Thirdly, by undertaking a detailed analysis of the relation between military expenditure and structural change in the OECD.
This research does in fact have a more general methodological purpose in that it addresses, and provides an extremely useful example of, the difficulties of measurement in economics.
Many of the issues raised in the study are not specific to the problem under analysis but have much wider implications.

Many important changes in the structure of the economy have occurred over the last twenty years.
Notable examples include foreign exchange and financial markets, technology and demography.
The research first aims to empirically model the resulting adjustments in the economy (such as the savings rate, housing demand and employment).
By discovering how economies adapt to major changes, the study will improve our empirical understanding of the present low savings rate, high house prices and relatively high unemployment levels.
The second aim of the investigation is to analyse the applicability of statistical methods to changing processes and investigate how econometric techniques need to be extended to cope with the more complicated economic relationships created by adjustment and change.
This will improve the set of tools available to researchers studying the impacts of technical change and financial innovation and thus help isolate the underlying parameters of economic behaviour.
The project follows up a previous ESRC supported research programme into the roles of expectations and feedbacks in empirical economics, which developed some of the new tools and computer software to be used in the present research.

The purpose of this project is to investigate the flows into and out of unemployment in Britain over the past twenty years.
Some work has been done on this topic in recent years, but this study will differ from previous approaches by linking the unemployment flows much more closely to the other flows in the labour market.
In particular, the movement of workers directly from one job to another has an effect on both the in flow into unemployment and the outflow from it, an effect that seems to have been neglected.
The inter-relationships between the flows will be at the centre of the proposed research.
The aim is to gain a better understanding of the unemployment flows, their relationship to turnover, and the implications for movements in unemployment.
The investigation will comprise three parts.
First, a theoretical framework will be developed, based on the decisions of workers and firms, linking the unemployment flow to quits, engagements and lay- offs.
Second, equations will be estimated for unemployment flows 1967 — 1985 for the whole economy.
Third, an analysis of the inflow and outflow rates over the regions of the U K will be carried out.

The use of trade policies, such as tariffs and devaluation as a means of improving economic performance remains controversial.
This project will examine the evidence for the world economy in the inter- war period.
The major part of this project will be to assemble a reliable and consistent data sets for analysing the impact of trade policies on the world economy.
the sample of countries to be covered includes the four leading industrial countries (Britain, France, Germany and America), two small European economies (The Netherlands and Switzerland) and two newly industrialising countries (Brazil and Mexico).
The leading industrial countries are essential simply because of their large weight in world trade and world industrial production and income.
The main European economies are of particular interest since the size of economies may be important to the issue of retaliation.
Moreover, The Netherlands is of particular interest since the country was the only continental nation that followed Britain on a course of free trade until the 1930's.
Brazil and Mexico will be taken to represent developing countries.

The project will investigate the structure of costs for grocery shops of different sizes within a large firm.
This will involve examination of the relation of size to the various cost components.
In particular the presence and form scale economics will be analysed, the relationship of these economies to product assortment and other short term operational variables, and whether costs are affected by capacity utilisation.
The results will be of interest to food retailers and have a wider significance for other areas of retailing.

Research Summary.
A hybrid research development coalition is where a public sector science group undertakes research exclusively on behalf of a single multinational company over a period of years in return for substantial capital and revenue funding.
This form of collaboration is said to have several advantages in that it offers greater control over research and development linkage by better managing the interface between public sector research and industry.
Moreover, hybrid coalitions overcome the organisational and political problems that have been associated with individual scientists/industry relations.
The study will examine the following issues: what types of coalition exist and how they vary both within and between the companies; how the hybrid organisation links to the wider ‘host’ public sector establishment; how companies monitor, assess and modify this type of linkage in both the short and long term; how the companies regard these concentrated coalitions compared with multiparty, less directive schemes; why sector equivalent companies have failed to initiate this type of linkage in the UK.
The coalitions made by four companies, taken from the UK and the US, within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors will be examined.
In addition four comparable British-based companies that do not engage in this type of linkage in the UK have also agreed to collaborate.
Field work will take the form of a literature review and visits will be made to the sites at three monthly intervals to reflect the institutions at different stages of development.
Focussed semi-structured interviews of industrial and public sector research staff, liaison officers and management will be conducted.

Whilst the Reynolds Committee guidelines and the Winfield Report are beginning to influence research student supervision, there still remains considerable variety in provision.
In particular the expectations of research often do not match the actual practice of their supervisors.
A similar problem has already been encountered in the work of engineers, teachers and more recently, nurses and technicians in high technology clinical areas.
The application of a speedy, economical, yet powerful method of job analysis has provided valuable help in clarifying these discrepancies.
The present research employs a version of the same approach to examine the practices of research supervisors and the expectations of research students.
The main stages in the study are:
1 Select a pilot sample of research supervisors and students 2 Interview this sample to obtain detailed role descriptions 3 Compile items from the interviews into a large checklist 4 Distribute the checklist to a large, representative sample 5 Analyse the completed checklists as required
The analyses will indicate the degree to which supervising practice matches the expectations of students.
This information will be helpful in identifying desirable provision in terms of courses or policies.

In his 1988 Budget, Mr Nigel Lawson reduced the top rate of income tax from 60 to 40 per cent and claimed that ‘Excessive rates of income tax destroy enterprise, encourage avoidance and drive talent to more hospital shores overseas’.
The aim of the research is to find out to what extent the cuts in the higher rates of income tax in the 1988 Finance Act may nave increased work effort, decreased avoidance and reduced emigration.
The method to be used is face-to-face interviews with accountants; accountants have been chosen because of their knowledge of the tax system, the likelihood that they pay high marginal tax rates and their familiarity with quantitative measurement; as well as their own reaction to the tax changes they will be asked about the reactions of their clients.
A sample of 400 will be drawn from amongst the members of private practice of the Chartered Institute of Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
Interviews, all of which will be conducted by the two Professors participating in the study, will take place in three broad geographical areas — London, Scotland and South West England.

The research will develop and justify improved econometric methodology, with applications in both macro-economics and micro-economics.
The methodology is designed to enable the applied econometrician to make good use of economic data, and of the information provided by economic theory, while reducing the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions or making inaccurate forecasts, owing to invalid assumptions about aspects of behaviour on which there is little or no information.
It is important that prior information be fully used and that the data be combined in the most efficient way, in view of the limited extent of much economic data.
However, it is also important to avoid introducing unnecessary assumptions, which have no prior basis and can invalidate the methodology.
All econometric models are vast simplifications of reality, entailing several layers of approximation, and the economic theory available may in any case be very limited, or controversial, or capable of quantifying in only a rough-and-ready fashion.
We cannot alter these circumstances, but we can try to make good use of such information that is available, and ‘make the data speak for themselves’ about other aspects, and this project will continue developments in this direction.

Consumer acceptance of new technology, seen in aggregate as the diffusion of that technology into the economic environment, is a key aspect of economic performance, affecting productivity, rates of return, employment and international trade.
The purpose of this research is to examine how consumer choices of new communications technology will interact with its development; and to consider some policy alternatives for enhancing the benefits from the application of that technology.
It assesses, in detail, the present situation and possible future developments in the United Kingdom, places these developments in the context of similar activities in other advanced industrial nations; and should draw generalisable conclusions on means of securing a readier acceptance of new technologies by the public as consumers and as citizens.
The study utilises a framework composed of four interrelated elements.
First, alternative technological solutions and the types of communication service they may carry are being identified.
Competition and complementarity between systems are being stressed, together with an assessment of likely technological advances.
Secondly, the focus turns to consumer acceptance itself.
In economic terms, the interaction of households with providers of services is of crucial importance.
Likely household demands for the new technologies are being identified and then the factors relating to the take-up of these products are being examined.
A further dimension concerns the implications of acceptance and of market potential for supply industries.
Finally, policy dimensions, such as the difficulties of regulating markets for information, consequences of privatisation, and minimising adverse effects, are being highlighted.
A wide variety of sources and contacts both national and international are being drawn upon.
This award is part of the Public acceptance of new technologies initiative (award reference number A/16/25/0000)

The principal means by which the effects of the creation of the Single European Market will be felt is through changes in international trade flows.
Thus crucial to any quantitative assessment of the 1992 programme are estimates of international trade elasticities.
Existing studies have had to use a range of previous estimates based upon differing methodological approaches and data samples, and often more than twenty years old.
This project seeks to estimate the key parameters of purchasing behaviour for each of the four major EC countries (France, West Germany, Italy and UK).
A recent sample (1970-87) of relatively detailed production and trade data will be collected and used to estimate a theoretically consistent model of the allocation of expenditure across both domestic and import suppliers.
The resulting estimates will then be used to calculate the changes in welfare resulting from some simple price reduction scenarios of 1992.

This project is part of a collaborative research programme between the ESRC and the Nature Conservancy Council.
It stems from the conflict in land use that arises whenever land of nature conservation value faces alternative and more commercially rewarding uses.
In such situations the ability to defend nature conservation resources is strengthened where the resource can earn at least a partial return from the market.
The research aims to identify the present economic contribution of wildlife/nature conservation resources and to evaluate the potential for their further economic development.
This will necessitate collecting and analysing information on a wide variety of nature conservation sites and facilities in Scotland, and will involve extensive field and postal survey work as well as liaison with conservation and other agencies.
Particular emphasis will be placed on a limited number of field study areas where nature conservation resources are under a variety of land use pressures.
The project also aims to evaluate the policies which influence the management of nature conservation resources and to identify how policies can be developed to increase the economic role of wildlife without detriment to the wider aims of nature conservation.
This part of the study will also involve extensive survey work, with particular attention paid to the attitudes of the owners, managers and users of nature conservation resources.

The distributional consequences of government policy are matters of much contemporary public interest and controversy.
This project contributes to an important aspect of this debate; the distribution of money income between persons, and its structure.
The primary focus is on the UK, but some international comparisons will be undertaken to put the British experience in context.
Some of the key questions to be addressed are: Has the UK income distribution become more or less equal over the last 10-15 years?
To what extent can trends be related to concomitant changes in age structure, household composition, or work patterns?
Can they be related to changes in the personal income tax and social security system?
The aim is to clarify the issues underlying such questions, drawing on and developing the appropriate economic theory, and to provide some concrete empirical evidence.
The data sources to be used are the detailed cross-sectional information about households provided by the UK Family Expenditure Survey tapes for each of the years 1971, 1976, 1981 and 1986, together with the longitudinal data in the Fifteenth Wave of the US Panel Survey of Income Dynamics, and the international cross-section data sets forming the Luxembourg Income Study.

This project involves two main stages.
Stage One will be an appraisal of the extent of land of nature conservation value in the East Midlands and East Anglia, concentrating particularly on land not at present under a statutory designation.
This will involve a review of existing habitat surveys, and other data sources in order to provide a basis for the selection of areas for detailed fieldwork and allow an assessment of their relevance to conservation planning.
Stage two will involve ecological assessment of land and surveys of landowners and managers within 1-3 sample areas including land of medium and high wildlife value identified during stage one.
The ecological survey will attempt to identify the relative conservation value of different pieces of land using standard techniques such as plant species diversity.
The socio-economic survey will examine how land varying conservation value fits into farm operations.
It will focus on the economics of land management and the influence of existing forms of land designation (for example Management agreements on Sites of Special Scientific Interest) on the way land is managed.
The research undertaken will provide a basis for nature conservation in the wider countryside and aid the promotion of nature conservation values.
It seeks to assess the position of existing policies and to identify possible policy initiatives.
The methodology developed will be applicable to the wider countryside in other parts of the country.

The Association of Directors of Research Centres in the Social Sciences (DORCISS) has been established to promote the effective leadership, organisation and management of those non-profit public knowledge research centres inside and outside higher education which have a significant level of research activity in the social sciences.
DORCISS will also promote the development of adequate infrastructure provision within research centres and, where appropriate, elsewhere within host institutions.
By assisting in the development of the research base represented by present and potential DORCISS members and to the professional development of staff in these centres, DORCISS aims to make a contribution to th overall vitality of economic and social research within the UK.
DORCISS will seek to achieve the above objectives by promoting the exchange of information and experience between members through an annual conference and by means of at least two management development workshops per year.
The latter will cover such topics as financial management and accounting; relationships with the host institutions and funders; research staff training and personnel development; European funding; the dissemination of research.

The problem of teacher supply continues to generate considerable concern.
This research will study the economics of the market for teachers in the UK.
The first part of this investigation will assess the statistical evidence relating to this market over the period 1960-1989 concentrating on the aggregate relationship between teacher's relative earnings, teacher supply and the demand for teachers.
The second part of this study will use a large sample of recent graduates to investigate the individual graduate's choice to become a teacher or not and the incentive to remain in teaching or to leave the job within the first few years.
This research will also attempt to: reappraise the manpower planning and wastage models used by the DES to forecast teacher supply; assess the importance of declining relative earnings in teaching; and investigate policies for influencing teacher supply.
It is anticipated that this research, when complete will add to our understanding of the problems of teacher supply and what the possible effects of alternative policies might be.

(Aims and methods) To develop the analysis of public policies towards firms with market power.
We see scope for theory and practice to inform one another.
Case study evidence can assist in the development of more applicable theoretical work in industrial organisation.
Better theory can help guide policy makers through the complex web of issues and data associated with cases in regulatory and competition policies.
To contribute to the development of richer economic theories that take simultaneous account of a number of issues that may arise in particular contexts.
For example, the economic effects of price discrimination in an industry may be sensitive to the way in which that industry is being regulated.
So too may be the welfare consequences of vertical integration and related practices.
To contribute to our knowledge and understanding of the operation of industries where firms have significant market power, with particular reference to the dynamics of competition in such markets.
To help build a larger and more integrated research group of economists at Oxford who are active in the area of industrial economics.
We see the project as providing a focus for the work of junior researchers in the University as well as for the research of existing faculty members.

This project addresses the impact of the UK welfare system ((Income Support, Family Credit, and Housing Benefit) on the labour force status of lone parents in the UK.
The data is drawn from the Family Expenditure Surveys 1979-1989 which yield more than 3,000 lone mothers for the analysis.
The analysis is based on econometric modelling and involves both the estimation of the determinants of labour market behaviour and the use of such estimates for stimulating the impact of policy changes.

This study examines the nature of the mobility of professional scientists over their working lives.
An important aspect of mobility is the extent to which, and paths by which, professionally trained scientists move into positions of responsibility involving managerial skills.
Furthermore, relatively little is known at present about the extent to which scientists change their type of work, and the precise nature of (and reasons for) moves between organisations, compared with movement within organisations, or internal mobility.
It is usual to regard labour mobility generally as helpful in the context of economic efficiency and structural change, but it is important to examine the special role played by internal mobility.
Those studies which concentrate on movement between firms necessarily ignore many important aspects of career changes, and the factors which contribute towards high relative earnings of individuals.
Despite the importance for labour training and manpower planning, information about career patterns is extremely rare in Britain, because of the problems of collecting and analysing longitudinal data.
The emphasis of the study is on professional chemists who are members of the Royal Society of Chemistry.
The Society, which has a very high response rate to its many postal questionnaires, has agreed to cooperate with a survey.
Professional chemists are very suitable for this type of study; it is possible to classify the types of work carried out, and other aspects of each job held over the career, in a clear and systematic way.
The project represents an extension of work based on earlier small scale surveys.

The aim of this project is to make a substantial contribution to the sparse literature on the household sector in China during the reform period of the 1980s.
Over the last decade or so, there has been a steady movement towards the establishment of free markets, the reduction of subsidies and the liberalisation of labour markets in China.
The effect has been a rapid growth in both consumer incomes and consumption opportunities.
The project will analyse the distribution over households of various indicators of living standards.
It will investigate the role of supply constraints and consumption subsidies and the possible effects of their removal in the course of reform.
Econometric techniques will be used to describe the distribution of living standard and construct models of household behaviour.

The objective is to provide an analysis of certain aspects of the longer term evolution of technological competitiveness in UK firms and industries, by comparison with the leading European countries.
The focus is a statistical examination, using US patent data, of historical trends in the sectoral composition of technological activity amongst, British, French and German firms.
This is to be achieved through compiling a computerised database on the history of European patenting in the USA between 1890 and 1962.
The research draws upon existing statistical studies of patenting activity, work on the history of patenting and on recent theories of technological innovation.
These are applied to construct appropriate statistical methods to analyse the course of technological development.
With reference to the sectoral composition of technological activity, the significance of cumulativeness, incremental change, and a varying degree of specialisation can be assessed.
As a particular case, the study investigates whether British firms historically became ‘locked in’ to innovation fields with fewer technological opportunities.
The data are to be collected at the Patent Office in London.
Selected large European companies with important research facilities are identified and the US patents granted to them recorded separately.
An allowance is to be made for variations between firms or sectors in the propensity to patent.

Much of economic theory, and a good deal of theorizing in other social sciences, rests on the theory of rational choice, as developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern and by Savage for individual decision- making in situations of uncertainty.
Game theory has developed this theory of rational choice a stage further by assuming that interacting agents have common knowledge of each other 's rationality.
However, this body of theory is now being questioned, partly because of growing evidence that people do not behave as the theory predicts, and partly because of the continuing discovery of cases in which the theory's recommendations as to rational choice conflict with most people's intuitions about what it would be reasonable to do.
The project explores the foundations of rational choice theory, probing the limitations of this theory and developing new approaches.
It combines theoretical and experimental methods, using an experimental laboratory set up with ESRC funds.
It integrates the approaches of economics and philosophy: four of the award holders are economists and one (Hollis) is a philosopher.

The purpose of this project is to undertake a detailed study of UK firms in order to model their behaviour in product and factor markets.
In particular, attention will be focused on the way firms' input-output decisions respond to changes in demand conditions and factor prices.
Questions concerning productivity and technical change, the efficiency of investment, likely future trends in employment and output, the consequences of the energy crises and the effect of tax and financial incentives cannot be given meaningful answers until reliable estimates of micro level technological parameters have been obtained.
In pursuance of this goal, the analysis will be largely econometric in nature although there are some important theoretical issues which have to be settled before estimation can take place.
The research programme consists of a number of related sub-projects all of which are designed to expose the motives behind firms' investment, employment, and where possible, hours and energy demand decisions.
These are:
(a)
the estimation of cost of adjustment/
interrelated dynamic factor demand systems on both firm and industry data bases;
(b)
the estimation of a four factor demand system for manufacturing, the four factors being capital, employment, hours and energy; and qualitative response model analysis of CBI investment and employment intentions data.

An efficient port transport system is vital to Britain's economy as trade accounts for nearly 60% of national income and over 90% of all imports and exports pass through the nations ports.
The aim of the research is to investigate the effects of the recently abolished National Dock Labour Scheme on port performance and whether a deregulated system of employment will enable British ports to close the ‘competitive gap’ on their European rivals.
The central focus of the project will be the impact of employee relations on port efficiency, but the research is expected to make a major contribution to the wider understanding of port operations and to inform current and future policy debates on the industry.
The research itself will combine a detailed analysis of industrial relations to the waterfront with the economic analysis of port performance, to be achieved through a combination of time series statistical analysis, a survey of port employers, and a number of detailed case studies of Britain's major ports.

There is increasing interest in studying industrial behaviour at the level of the business unit, rather than using data average across industrial categories.
The aim of this research is to investigate how uncertainty an environmental complexity (such as volatility of key variables) influences fixed investment at the level of the business unit.
This is to be assessed using panel data from the PIMS Competitive Strategy business unit data.
Micro-level investment equations are estimated for a number of three and four-digit industries.
A number of measures of business uncertainty are constructed.
The main uncertainty variable is the turbulence in market share movements.
The research sets out a number of hypotheses on how market share turbulence should affect investment.
The results of the estimation are discussed in the light of theses hypotheses.
The research takes further some of the central concerns on investment under uncertainty discussed in C. Driver and D. Moreton: Investment, expectations and uncertainty, Basil Blackwell 1992.
The research is part of a wider programme involving staff and doctoral students at Imperial College Management School.

Large firms generally face a choice between making components and other intermediate products themselves, or buying in from outside — in other words, a decision whether to internalize or externalize a particular stage of production.
Among the smaller firms supplying the larger ones, some may be operating independently and others as subcontractors.
The Japanese system of subcontracting has attracted much popular attention, especially in the motor industry, where it has been widely believed to have improved Japanese industrial efficiency by promoting specialized investment and technical innovation by supplier-firms who, in turn, have their sales guaranteed if they perform effectively.
This project aims to investigate subcontracting in selected Japanese industries, using depth interviews.
It may also shed light on the standards required for British firms who wish to act as subcontractors to the many Japanese foreign investors in Britain and Europe.
The research will be conducted in cooperation with the project ‘Subcontracting and the small business’ also ESRC financed, which relates to the UK and is being carried out by other economists in the University of East Anglia's Economics Research Centre.

This project will distinguish the degree of inequality in the experience of unemployment in six local labour markets in Britain.
Economic models will be constructed to explain the differing unemployment experience of different individuals in each of these markets.
The degree to which characteristics and local and national factors help explain the differing degree of unemployment will be investigated.
The study draws on data for six local labour markets in Britain gathered under an earlier ESRC sponsored project titled The social change and economic life initiative.
It links to a further ESRC supported research project which uses the same database to analyse wage structure and pay determination.

It will distinguish the extent to which national as distinct from regional factors influence pay.
The study will analyse difference in the pay of individuals in the public and private sectors of the economy.
It will also evaluate a range of explanations which suggest that wages may be set above the market clearing level for efficient reasons.
The study draws on data for six separate labour markets in Britain gathered under an earlier ESRC sponsored initiative titled The social change and economic life initiative.
It links to a further ESRC supported research project, using this same database, to analyse unemployment.

Research summary.
The project aimed to analyse and measure the impact of contestable markets on performance in the delivery of UK public services.
The study focused in three central issues: what is known about the introduction of competition into the provision of goods previously supplied publicly; whether competition improves efficiency — and the relative contributions of competition and ownership; and the scope for extending competition tendering in the UK public sector.
The research involved three stages.
First, a data collection exercise assembled evidence from published sources through direct contact with the MoD, Armed Forces and local authorities.
Second, a structured postal questionnaire survey was conducted addressing relevant public sector groups.
And third, relevant data was analysed using statistical and econometric techniques.

The South African economy has long been dependent on minerals, especially gold.
This has involved close linkages between private and public capital and between mining and other sectors of the economy, giving rise to a core economic bloc which might be termed a mineral-energy complex.
A critical review of literature around the notion of the military-industrial complex and that relevant from development economics will be made to formulate an appropriate theory for the mineral-energy complex.
This will be used to identify the structure, dynamics and boundaries of the complex and to analyse its historical origins and its contemporary relevance for the crisis and future prospects of the South African economy.
Through a survey of the major businesses involved, the strengths in capital goods manufacture, in the context of a general weakness, will be identified and explained, with particular attention to those sectors related to mining.
This will be used to test the hypothesis that the relationship between state policy and private capital has been crucial to the development of the mineral-energy complex and has been an important factor in the successful capital goods sectors; this will be supplemented through comparative analysis with other mineral and energy producers in developing economies.
During the course of the research, other areas will be explored as they prove to important for analytical or policy purposes, such as the impact of sanctions or the options for the mineral-energy complex in post-apartheid South Africa.

Levels of self employment in the Northern region are the lowest in Britain, whereas unemployment remains high, despite recent falls.
On Wesrside, where this study takes place, the problems are particularly acute.
The government has promoted the small firm and the enterprise culture as important contributions to workforce flexibility, and the restructuring process.
Access to unpaid family labour and to family networks provide the small family business with an important element of flexibility.
In this context, can an entrepreneurial family be identified?
What are the connections between internal family adaptability and external market flexibility, and what are their implications for entrepreneurial and small firm policies in a peripheral local economy?
The research will explore the inter-relations between the formal market activities of self-employed men and women, and the formal and informal work activities of their families.
It will look at the motivations of different family members, and identify the ways families negotiate the division of business and household work.

There is a growing consensus that one of the major factors contributing to the relatively poor record of labour productivity in Britain is the low level of skill in the workforce compared with that of the major competitors.
Despite the acknowledged importance of skill acquisition there is relatively little known about who receives vocational training.
There is a notable shortage of information about non-certificated training on the job.
This project aims to investigate what factors help to increase the likelihood that a worker is receiving training, by making use of hitherto unused responses to the government's large-scale General Household Survey in 1987.
The research aims to look both at personal characteristics, such as age and sex, and also at company characteristics, such as the number of employees at the workplace.
The conclusions to this study are expected to be of use to policy-makers in deciding where help in promoting a better trained workforce is most needed.

The aim of this project is to assess the technological level of the economy in the ‘newly democratising’ countries of what was generally called Eastern Europe, namely Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.
It is intended to approach this by studying:— their patenting activity by means of patents granted to them in the United States in the past 25 years; this will indicate the areas where the industries/economies of each country — and their research/innovative activity appears to be strongest;— the adoption of the selected major postwar innovations and their diffusion in the industries of each of the countries covered;— their performance in ‘high-technology’ areas;— certain indicators of the countries' energy economics;— and possibly assess their productivity level in comparison with some West European countries; Economic research institutes in Sofia, Prague, Budapest and Warsaw will cooperate by providing — where necessary — the technical and statistical information required.
The Western countries selected for comparison will vary but will certainly include Austria and Finland.

Despite the recent decline in unemployment long duration unemployment continues to be an important problem.
It is particularly important for older workers over the age of 50, but not confined to this group.
Higher proportions of older unemployed workers experience long unemployment durations now than in the late 1970's.
A full understanding of current unemployment and the role it plays in the working of the labour market requires an explanation of the persistence of long duration unemployment.
The most common explanation for long-duration unemployment among older workers is that they lack skill which enable them to find work in the expanding sectors of the economy, and, being older, do not have the expected future working lives to justify further training and retraining.
Although this is highly plausible there are few studies of the skills possessed by older unemployed workers.
One reason for this is that older workers tend to lack certification for skill even if they have been acquired.
The present research will elucidate this and the general characteristics of older unemployed workers by analysing information relating to 1,800 of the older unemployed.
In particular it will look at the work experiences of these workers, their occupational backgrounds and skill levels.

Since the deregulation of local bus services in 1986, subsidising authorities have no longer been able to buy in a bus network via a global subsidy.
Subsidy is now allocated to individual routes or batches of routes following a tendering process.
It is now common for routes to comprise a mixture of commercial and subsidised times of day, days of week or even geographical sections.
The continuous tendering process, the impact of deregistrations and the rate of change in the commercial network exert extreme pressures on decision making processes.
The time constraints for decisions to be made are tight, as operators are required to give only six weeks' notice of their intention to withdraw or change a service.
Where budgets no longer allow support to be given to all services that an authority wishes to procure, decisions will have to be made as to where any cuts will fall.
This project aims to investigate the methods used by local authorities to determine priorities for funding amongst bus services.
It is also intended to compare methods in terms of their outcomes.
The first phase of the study will consist of a survey of county level funding authorities in order to identify their objectives and the techniques used in the evaluation of bus services.
The second phase will involve more detailed case study work with a small number of authorities to look at techniques in practice.
The methods used will be compared using sample service data.

Road pricing, which involves charging drivers directly for their use of the road network, has been advocated for several years as a means of reducing congestion and environmental impact.
It is currently being investigated in detail as part of an overall transport strategy which might include infrastructure provision and traffic management.
One of the major criticisms of road pricing is its equity impacts.
These include the effect on lower income drivers, but also the impact on short journeys across pricing cordons and the response of those whose car is subsidised.
In some case such as subsidised motorists and those with high values of time, it is argued that road pricing will have little impact, and could even encourage additional travel.
This project is investigating these issues, using a strategic model of London, developed for the London Planning Advisory Committee, which will be disaggregated to represent different income groups and those with differing degrees of subsidy separately.
By assigning elasticities and values of time obtained from the literature, it will assess the response of each group to different levels of road pricing, the extent to which each group benefits or loses, and the impact of these different group responses on the overall performance of road pricing.
Because several elasticity values are uncertain, considerable sensitivity testing will be conducted, to identify those values to which the results are most sensitive.
The results will be of direct benefit to current studies of road pricing in London and elsewhere.

Redundancy is a predominant form of adjustment to changes in the demand for labour.
Why it is chosen as an adjustment option by firms, the labour market experience of subsequently unemployed workers and the secondary employment effects of redundancy, form the central topics of the research.
The study is based upon the labour market experience and behaviour of a sample of the 2,400 employees made redundant in April 1985 by the Michelin company, the major employer in the Stoke on Trent travel-to-work area.
The research aims to study the means by which redundant workers find employment and the ease or difficulty of doing so.
This is to be done by a questionnaire which will seek to identify the channels through which jobs are sought, the number of firms approached and the wages expected and gained.
Local firms will also be investigated to see, first how they adapt to increased labour supply and secondly in what circumstances they use redundancy as a means of adjusting their labour force.
Central to the research, therefore, is the study of redundancy in the context of how labour markets adjust.
An overview of the workings of the local economy will be obtained by linking the changing expenditure patterns of redundant workers with local demand and employment effects, by integrating the research with an already established input-output model.

The prospect of global warming is forcing governments to decide what fraction of their national resources to direct towards abating it.
Governments have also to decide how to divide these resources between alternative uses: reducing emission of greenhouse gasses, building sea defenses, and so on.
These are quantitative decisions, and quantitative analysis must guide them.
But the problems raised by global warming are unprecedented in several respects, so that the established tools of economic analysis cannot deal with them properly.
Fundamental work, in welfare economics and philosophical ethics, will be needed to bring these tools to bear on the problem of global warming.
This study is aimed at two of the unprecedented features of the problem: that many of the effects will be far in the future, and that global warming will have a large effect on the size of the world's population.
We need to balance benefits coming to future generations against personal benefits.
And we need to fix a value on changes in future population, These questions are the subject of lively debate in philosophy and economics.
Our aim is to bring together work in these areas, and to direct it towards the specific problem of global warming.

In the 1980s, the proportion of the workforce unionised has fallen sharply.
Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) data suggest, however, that workplace union recognition has remained constant except in private manufacturing, where the proportion has declined.
The correlation between plant size and employment falls in the 1980s probably explains these trends.
How is wage determination in the union sector affected by trends in union membership, and in union recognition?
Does falling membership imply weakening trade union power and therefore a narrowing gap (markup) of union over non-union wages?
Is the desire to join unions by individuals now severely constrained by the unwillingness of new or existing employers to recognise trade unionism especially in private manufacturing?
The project intends to use WIRS data to examine the inter-relationship between recognition (coverage), union density and wage determination, building on theoretical models of this interaction, and extending to the econometric testing of alternative hypotheses.

Absenteeism is undoubtedly very costly for British industry.
Each year the number of working days lost will exceed, by a significant margin, those lost by strikes even in the very worst years of industrial unrest.
The primary focus of this project was to analyse absence behaviour at an individual level, and where employment contracts were characterised by experience-rated sickpay, which means that the rate of sickpay is determined by past absence.
In this situation present behaviour can potentially effect future entitlement.
Also the way in which individuals view the future will differ and will typically be unobservable.
Consequently, our analysis used statistical methods appropriated for the analysis of data with unobserved effects (our data comprised of a large number of daily histories, in the late 1980's which had been previously collected).
In particular the project compared two methods of accounting for unobserved effects (marginal likelihood and information matrix corrections) and achieved a computational advance in the first.
Overall the characteristics of the remuneration scheme were shown to exert more consistent effects than were individuals' personal characteristics.
Systems of formal warnings to control absence also seem to be less effective than the terms of the remuneration scheme.

Over the last five years British agricultural research has been subject to major reorganisation.
Large cuts in government funding have been justified on the grounds that those stand to benefit from ‘near market’(or readily exploitable) research should pay for it; government will fund the rest.
Various interest groups (eg: The National Farmers' Union, the UK Agricultural Supply Trade Association, and agricultural scientists) have warned of the consequences of this policy.
Anyone wishing to assess the validity of their criticisms, however, will find only a small historical literature in the relationship between private sector interests and public sector agricultural research in the United States and nothing at all in Britain.
This project is looking at the way in which plant-breeding at public sector institutes in Scotland, Wales and England has been influenced by various interest groups: government (via the Agricultural Research Council), the private sector (including farmers' organisations and seed companies), and the academic community.
Of particular interest are the effects of certain organisational changes after 1945, among them
(a)
the ARC's decision to cut some of its institutes' affiliation with universities, allegedly in order to discourage ‘ivory-tower’ research, and
(b)
the replacement of these institutes' funds from local private sector sponsors with central government funding via the ARC.
Finally, the agricultural impact of the new plant varieties bred at these institutes — both before and after the organisational changes of 1945 — will be assessed.

The aim of the research is to illuminate various strands of short-time working and related legislation.
The research
(i)
undertakes case studies at firm and plant level to see what happens in practice, paying special attention to administrative rules, technology, negotiations;
(ii)
examines both fluctuations over time in employment, hours and productivity and the industrial pattern of response to fluctuations in demand;
(iii)
sees how redundancy payments and short-time working schemes interact;
(iv)
studies the extent to which firms' fixed costs have been raised by Employment Protection legislation and the implications for work patterns;
(v)
examines the design of an optimal short-time working scheme.
All these strands pay attention to European experience as well as British practice.

We live in a ‘market economy’ and many one time ‘command economies’are endeavouring to change to the same arrangements.
While understanding such economies has been a central aim of Western economists for two hundred years there is a great deal which has not yet been understood.
This project is concerned with three problems:
(a)
Traditionally we think of market prices as signals which lead to the co-ordination of economic activities (no unwanted shortages or surpluses).
However in many cases such signals are not produced because there are no markets or only imperfect ones.
For instance in general, it is not possible for most goods to trade present amounts of them for future amounts nor is it possible to make such contracts conditional on some outside events like the weather.
The fact that these opportunities are ‘missing’ has profound effects on the coordinating abilities of markets.
We are hoping to gain a better understanding of why there are too few markets.
whether there are institutional substitutes for them (eg. contracts) and how precisely the co-ordinating power of market economies is affected.
(b)
Missing markets mean that people have to act (eg. trade present consumption for future consumption by investing today) without knowing the precise terms on which this can be done.
They must form expectations.
As time proceeds they will learn from their mistakes.
What is the form of this learning and is it consistent with eventual market co-ordination?
(c)
Both
(a)
and
(b)
lead naturally to a consideration of market possibilities in which there is trade and negotiation amongst few traders and to the possibility of non-market institutions.
Game theory provides the appropriate vehicle of study.
Here we have also made some progress with evolutionary learning and the analysis of contracts.

Since the 1930s, the Library of the Scott Polar Research Institute has built up an extensive collection of material relating to the Soviet Arctic.
Much of this material cannot be found anywhere else outside the USSR, and, is according to some recent Soviet visitors, much cannot be found even there.
This is especially true of the more politically controversial material.
The collection is strong in ethnographic, social and political publications relating to the ll people the Soviet North.
Economic development also receives extensive coverage, with the various plans to develop the extensive natural resources in a region of extreme environmental difficulty treated in detail, as are also the resulting environmental and socio-economic difficulties.
ESRC-funding will enable this important literature to be made much more accessible to western social scientists.
Journals, books, conference proceedings, etc. will be scanned for relevant material.
Bibliographic details will be recorded, translated abstracted abstracts added, and — to aid subject access — all items indexed using Universal Decimal Classification scheme (polar schedule).
A printed bibliography with author and subject indexes will be supplied to the ESRC and all items made accessible on the bibliographic database SPRILIB maintained at the Scott Polar Research Institute.

Income Distribution and wealth; Public finance and expenditure; Inequality
Empirical analysis of the redistribution of income by the tax and social security systems has traditionally proceeded by comparing the degree of inequality in incomes before and after taxes and benefits.
This perspective focuses on the income differences within each distribution separately, but does not take into account the reordering of people's positions in the distribution that takes place in going from one to another.
The motivation for the research is the view that a complete assessment of redistribution policy needs to study not only the potential compression of income differences, but also the second, reranking, aspect, and it is on this ‘distributional change’ that the work focuses.
The aim is to document the overall extent of distributional change in Britain, to examine whom is most affected by it, and to see what aspects of taxation and social security contribute most to it.
Whether or not such changes are equitable will also be explored.
The research is based on information about households available in the Family Expenditure Survey.

The project will examine the economic principle that should govern the taxation of energy (domestic and industrial fuels and motor fuel) in the single European market, and will assess the range of effects (including effects on industrial competitiveness, environmental objectives, income distribution and public revenues) that would result from the adoption of various possible Community rules for the structure and level of energy taxes.
Economic analysis of the general principles which should underlie the division of functions between the European Community and member state governments places considerable emphasis on the role of'spillovers' or ‘externalities’ arising from the policy decisions of member states.
Drawing on this conceptual framework, the research would seek to identify the key issues in policy towards the taxation of energy, including those where significant spillovers would arise from the policy decisions of individual member states (e.g. effects on intra-EC competition, and cross frontier environmental impacts) and those where important, but largely domestic, considerations are involved (e.g. ‘efficient’ commodity taxation, revenue and distributional effects).
The effects under each of these headings of various possible Community rules for energy taxation would then be quantified drawing both on existing research and available data, and, where appropriate, making use of tax policy simulation models for the UK and other member states being developed under a SPES project coordinated from IFS.

Czechoslovakia is in the process of change towards a market economy.
As part of this process, the sources of government revenue and the structure of welfare provisions need to be changed to reflect the political objective of individual responsibility and the need to provide an economic reward for individual effort.
There is a large literature on tax design in market economies, and a major part of the research will consist of investigating the extent to which this body of knowledge can be applied to the particular circumstances of Czechoslovakia.
The likely effects of various tax and welfare benefit proposals will be analysed by applying simulation models to data on households and firms.
The data will be supplied by Czechoslovak collaborators, and the simulations will predict both the distributive and incentive effects of proposed changes.
It is expected that the results from this research will be an input into Czechoslovak decision-making.
In addition, the project will enable a great deal to be learnt about the theoretical and practical issues on studying centrally-planned economies in the process of transition.
The lessons learnt should be of great value to the analysis of other countries in the process of transition.

Many actions of governments and societies have effects that may broadly be called demographic: they affect the lengths of people's lives, and they affect the future size of the world's population.
The rise in sea level caused by global warming, for instance, is likely to lead to many deaths and to large changes in population, as a result of flooding.
Conversely, actions to mitigate global warming may save lives, and may themselves alter the size of the population.
Urgent practical decisions have to be made about actions that will have demographic affects.
But the standard approaches to decision making, such as cost-benefit analysis, cannot help with these decisions, because we have no comprehensive theory about how values should be assigned to demographic changes.
There has been some discussion in welfare economics and philosophical ethics about aspects of the problem, but there is no integrated treatment of the general question of valuing demographic changes.
The aim of this research is to try and fill the gap.
It will be theoretical research that uses methods and arguments from both economics and ethics.

Unlike CFCs, CO2 emissions cannot be dealt with at the micro level by changing technologies: CO2 is so directly linked with almost all productive technology that its control must have profound macroeconomic consequences.
The aim of this project is to quantify the medium-term macroeconomic impact on the world economy and on the main countries and blocs of measures to reduce CO2 emissions.
It will focus on the problems arising from the interplay of national environmental policies.
These resemble the well-known problems of international macroeconomic policy-making, and can be analysed as a strategic game between national policy-makers.
Although cooperative solutions may be desirable overall, there can be strong incentives for individual countries to ‘free ride’, so that international agreements are to sustain.
The project will investigate formally the gains that result from coordinated policies on CO2 emissions, as against unilateral policies, and suggest how international agreements on CO2 emissions may be designed so as to ensure they are sustainable.
The project brings together expertise in macroeconomic modelling, econometrics, international policy coordination and environmental economics, and will exploit the modelling framework of London Business School's Global Econometric Model.

Since the mid-1960s, the agricultural sector in Chile has been transformed through a combination of structural reforms and changes in economic policy.
The distribution of land has become less unequal, while the rapid growth in exports of fruit and forestry products has given rise to new patterns of regional income inequality.
This project uses survey data from a nation-wide sample of small farm households who were first interviewed in 1968 and then re-interviewed in 1986.
The research examines the evolution of property rights and assesses the mobility of land ownership and farm size in nine small holding communities.
The operation of rental and freehold land markets is compared to inheritance as a means of access to land.
Changes in land use and land productivity over the period area analysed.
The extent and nature of migration is discussed with reference to the evolution of local labour markets.
Finally, the project measures changes in the level and sources of household income over the period and evaluates changes in government policy towards the rural poor.

The White Paper, ‘The Way Ahead: benefits for disabled people’, published in January 1990, proposed reform of disability related income transfers.
One motivation for the reform was the perceived disincentive to labour market participation generated by the current benefit rules.
At present, a recipient of Invalidity Benefit is likely to lose the whole of this income transfer as soon as they enter employment.
In the last decade the number of individuals claiming Invalidity Benefit has doubled; the transfer currently costs the Treasury approximately 3.5 billion pounds.
There is little evidence available either to assess the magnitude of any labour market disincentives created by existing disability benefits or to predict the impact of the proposed reforms on the employment and incomes of people with disabilities.
This project will attempt to fill this gap in knowledge.
The research will utilise data from the 1985 OPCS Disability Survey and the 1986/7 Family Expenditure Surveys to estimate the responsiveness of the employment and hours of work decisions of disabled people to economic incentives.
These estimates will be used to simulate the labour supply and income of the proposed reforms.

The programme is in two closely related parts concerned with the UK and world economy respectively.
(In the case of the world economy the programme is a joint enterprise with the London Business School).
The aims of the programme are:
(1)
To advance understanding of macroeconomic behaviour, using a consistent framework derived from economic theory and the best available techniques for estimation and hypothesis testing.
(2)
To develop and maintain quarterly models of domestic and world economies which embody the results of our time-series econometric research.
(3)
To use these models, and the underlying research in commenting on economic developments, and in the analysis of policy options at home and abroad.
The use of the model for policy analysis generally presupposes that a forecast of the economy over a period of several years is available.
The Institute publishes economic forecasts for both the UK and the world four times a year in our ‘Economic Review’, the production and dissemination of these forecasts however is not part of the performance financed by the ESRC Consortium).
The model is then used to estimate the consequences of specified policies different to those assumed in the initial base forecast.
Policy optimisation techniques are also used to calculate the policy settings which would come closest to achieving some desired path for the economy.

This grant from the Macro-Economic Modelling Consortium provides continuing support for the macroeconomic research undertaken at London Business School's Centre for Economic Forecasting.
It will fund a four-year programme of fundamental research of direct policy relevance, oriented around the Centre's macroeconometric model of the UK economy and the Global Econometric Model, which is now a collaboration between London Business School and the NIESR.
Key policy issues to be analysed are the UK economy in the ERM; the impact of financial deregulation, particularly on consumption and housing; UK productivity and supply-side performance; the operation of the labour market; and the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies.
On the international side, the research will investigate a partially bilateral approach to the modelling of trade flows; the supply side; the consumption, labour and financial markets of the major OECD countries; and international policy questions.
The research will not, however, be solely model-based.
Efforts will be made to ensure that it is based on state-of-the-art econometric techniques and on strong and, where appropriate, innovative theoretical underpinnings.
Particular attention will be paid to cointegration, the long run, the treatment of risk, and the modelling of expectations.

The last decade has seen substantial development in macroeconomic theory.
This project involves building a new econometric macro-model of the UK economy that will incorporate this new theory if it proves consistent with UK evidence.
It will be smaller than most existing models, which will allow the model to be theoretically consistent, and which will also facilitate the use of recent computer intensive techniques in the examination of policy issues.
The project team will not publish forecasts (although the model could be used to do so); this will allow a clear focus on achieving the best academic standards.
The theoretical developments that will be incorporated in the model are extensive, and include a clear identification of the microeconomic foundations of Keynesian dynamic behaviour, a comparison of New Keynesian and Real Business Cycle theories of economic fluctuations, an analysis of the causes and consequences of recent changes in credit rationing in the UK, and an explicit treatment of the vintage character of production.
The model would be used to comment on topical policy issues such as the consequences for the UK of ERM membership and Monetary Union, as well as more long-standing concerns such as the causes and control of inflation.

It is not clear whether European Economic Integration and the rules governing the completion of the Single European Market (SEM) will increase or reduce regional disparities.
At one level, EC regional policy is committed to improving the competitive potential of the less favoured regions (LFRs).
At another level, EC policies particularly in the areas of competition and technology seem set to favour further concentration and spatial centralisation of industry (more likely to be in the most advanced regions) in a bid to develop European champions capable of taking on US and Japanese competition.
The aim of this project is to explore the above regional paradox.
It examines the conflicts and complementarities between the objectives and rules of European competition, technology and regional policy, and the degree to which EC rules complement and support policy structures for local economic development within the LFRs.
It also examines the influence of the SEM and related rules on the locational behaviour of large firms with respect to the LFRs in order to establish whether the nature and quality of investment in such regions may enhance regional development potential.
The project bases its method primarily on interviews with policymakers at both EC and local level, case studies of corporate restructuring in four industrial sectors (pharmaceuticals, computer services, telecommunication equipment and electrical generation equipment) and case studies of selected LFRs in Britain, Spain, Italy, Greece and Germany.

This project looks at the global industrial context of the Single European Market.
It will examine the extent to which EC evolves into a ‘rule-based’ system in which member states see their own past commitments as totally binding.
Following the Single European Act, the EC must develop and implement an integrated set of rules on competition, trade and technology.
‘Globalisation of business’ blurs the distinction between EC and non EC firms.
Traditional instruments of policy lose their force.
Tariffs can no longer protect ‘EC’ firms from ‘non EC’firms located in Europe.
EC firms are producing more output overseas, while Japanese-owned firms are expanding R&D inside the Community.
Acute policy dilemmas arise, as between continuing liberalisation versus ‘technological mercantilism’ inspired by genuine fears of ‘strategic dependence’in some areas.
So far the choice has been fudged by declared commitments to both EC technological collaboration and more competition.
This project will examine the economic, political, legal and technological issues at stake with cars and electronics as case studies.

Economic forecasts are widely used both by policy-makers and by the business and financial community at large.
But in recent years concern has been growing that economic forecasts are not up to the mark.
This project aims to contribute towards improving the accuracy of economic forecasts by exploiting the concept of the ‘leading indicator’ more thoroughly than has been done before.
Leading indicator variables are particular economic variables that have a proven ability to signal the movement of the economy in advance.
A key weakness of conventional forecasting methods is that they often fail to capture the ‘turning points’— the onset of recession or the beginning of recovery.
Leading indicators have the potential to assist in the correct identification of turning points, as well as to improve the accuracy of forecasting more generally.
In the UK, the Central Statistical Office produces leading indicator information which will be exploited in the project; but similar information is also available from other sources for the principal industrial countries (the so-called ‘Group of Seven’).
The project will assess the value of candidate leading indicators in both cases, and will examine the best way of combining several such variables into composite indices.

If economic development continues on its present path, global greenhouse gas (GG) emissions can be expected to increase further from present levels, rather than to decline.
For Western economies such as the UK the challenge in cutting emissions is even greater because emissions per head of population are much higher than in most developing countries.
A reduction of GG emissions to sustainable rates implies massive changes in levels and structures of energy use and radical changes in economic behaviour.
The project is to adapt and revise the existing Cambridge Multisectoral Dynamic Model (MDM) so as to provide a quantitative assessment of the costs and benefits for the UK in policies in GG abatement.
An important first stage in the research will be the estimation of a system to allow the different fuel inputs to industries and consumers to change according to relative prices.
The research will develop the methodology of quantitative analysis of energy policies relating to GG emissions.
It will explore how long-run technical change, particularly that associated with energy use, can be modelled and introduced into an economic model, ensuring satisfactory properties of the model over the next century.

This study explores two neglected but important aspects of estimating the welfare costs of greenhouse gas abatement policies.
First, existing studies of the costs of abatement generally ignore the extent to which the demand for and supply of different fuels are affected by subsidies and taxes.
In many countries, and especially in the former centrally planned economies, taxes and subsidies make the prices paid by consumers for various fuels different from those received by producers.
As a result the value of a unit of a particular fuel to consumers differs from its costs of production and the true cost (to consumers) of cutting consumption differs from the accounting cost.
Unless such differences are taken into account, estimates of abatement costs will be inaccurate and governments may seek to control the wrong fuels.
The second study will look at how national demand patterns for energy- intensive goods vary depending whether the country is poor or rich.
Controlling carbon dioxide emissions ultimately entails reducing the consumption of energy-intensive goods.
It is important to know whether this will impinge heavily on the poor.
For example, tax rates may have to differ across countries in order to achieve particular abatement targets and schemes for compensating the hardest hit consumers may need to developed.

This research follows on from previous work on the diffusion of new technology undertaken as part of the ESRC Research Initiative on New Technologies and the Firm.
The prime objectives of this research are to explore the impact on firm performances of the early or late adoption of new technology.
Initial hypotheses on the literature suggest either,
(i)
that firms who are early adopters of new technology get a greater benefit than do laggard firms, or by contrast,
(ii)
that late adopters do better.
However, our earlier work suggested that in the case of CNC Machine tools there was no apparent relationship between the adoption of this technology and the failure of firms.
This may suggest that both initial hypotheses are too simple to gain much support.
Two particular issues of which we take account in attempting to refine the simple hypotheses are, first, that any single technology is probably, of itself, not sufficiently important to affect firm performance to any large extent, and second, that potential adopters of new technology differ from each other in various important dimensions and thus the ‘best’ adoption date for one firm may differ considerably from the ‘best’adoption date for another firm.
With this in mind, the research proceeds by first constructing and estimating a multi-technology diffusion model.
This is a model of the diffusion process that takes account of the observation that often a number of different interrelated technologies are being diffused simultaneously.
From this model it will be possible to provide estimates of the ‘best’ dates for firms of different characteristics to adopt new technologies.
These best dates may then be compared with actual adoption dates.
The third stage of the research is to explore the impact upon the performance of firms of differences between their actual and their estimated ‘best’ adoption dates.
The research will involve theoretical development and both econometric work and back up case study analysis.
The econometric work will be undertaken on a data set constructed by CURDS at the University of Newcastle which details the adoption dates of nine technologies in approximately 1500 firms in the metalworking and engineering industry.

A major focus of industrial policy within the EC and elsewhere lies in attempts to influence the evolution of high technology industries.
This project is concerned with examining how number of high technology industries have evolved over time.
The methodology of the study involves a combination of theory and econometric evidence, together with detailed historical studies of each industry.
A central aim of the work is to determine the extent to which will founded generalisations are Possible as to the manner in which the structure of these industries evolves.
In particular, the study aims to elucidate the way in which various kinds of policy initiative are likely to affect performance in these sectors.
The industries studies range across a broad spectrum of sectors, and include inter alia computers, aircraft, scientific and medical instruments, and pharmaceuticals.

Over the last three years there has been vigorous discussion of the consequences of the removal of trade and currency controls on the eastern European economies.
Opinion has been divided on whether they should be removed suddenly or gradually.
There is a historical analogy with the removal of controls on west European economies after 1945.
Although there has been much detailed study of the effects of tariff reduction in western Europe over the period 1945-68 there has been virtually no research into the impact on foreign trade and national balances of payments of the removal of non-tariff barriers, especially the quotas which had been widely imposed from 1931 onwards.
Neither has there been any work relating the relaxation of currency controls and the establishment of convertibility within the European Payments Union to changes in the volume and pattern of foreign trade.
We intend to establish a schedule of quota removals for three major economies, Britain, France and Germany and measure the relative impact on their trade and balance of payments of quota removals and currency decontrol.

It has been shown that more than one third of all new businesses cease trading within two or three years of start up and the vast majority of those remaining in business are small throughout their economic life.
Only two or three businesses in every hundred grow rapidly and this project is designed to identify the characteristics of those ‘fast growers’.
It is recognised that it is almost impossible to correctly identify the characteristics of fast growers at a start-up stage but once a track record of two or three years data exists selection may be possible.
Publicly available data will be used rather than, at this stage, conducting interviews with business owners.

During the last decade, there has been much research on the effect on economic performance in Western industrialised countries of the structure of and the relations between the main economic institutions.
These include unions, large companies and employers' organisations, financial institutions, central bank, government and (more broadly) the political system.
In ‘corporatist’ countries, for instance Austria and Sweden, economic decisions (on such diverse matters as taxes, the welfare state, training and wage negotiations) have frequently been the outcome of formal or informal negotiations between government and non-government institutions, especially unions and employers' organisations.
At the other end of the scale, the USA is often seen as relatively free of corporatist decision making.
The research aims to produce a comprehensible assessment of the economic effects of different institutional structures, at both macro and micro levels.
There are two parts to the project.
The first is a survey of existing work.
The second looks at a number of countries (ranging from the USA to Austria); in each country, the project discusses the relation between the institutional structure and economic policy-making and outcomes at macro and micro levels, with reference to the following external shocks: OPEC 1 and 2, world recession and rapid technological change.

Both within the UK and internationally, issues concerning appropriate constitutional structures for government are at the forefront of debate.
Within the UK issues under active debate include voting rules, regional devolution, the reform of the House of Lords, and the appropriate form for relations with the EC.
However, constitutional theory has not been at the heart of modern social science research.
While there has been some work on aspects of constitutions — particularly voting rules — only very recently has there been a return to the constitutional perspective associated with the classical constitutional theory associated with Montesquieu and Madison.
This project aims to apply the methods of modern economics to the subject matter of classical constitutional theory and so analyse in some detail the implications of alternative constitutional provisions such as bicameralism, the separation of powers, parliamentary procedures and political parties.
The theoretical modelling will extend and integrate existing work and provide an input into ongoing constitutional debates.

New survey data often record personal biographies and provide a continuous record of the economic activities of people over several years.
As compared with the more usual situation in which we only know the activity of people over a short period, such data raise some challenging statistical and econometric problems.
In particular we need to know how best to formulate models of behaviour to apply to such data and how best to test whether these models are consistent with the evidence.

It is common for Local Enterprise Agencies (LEAs) to reach a point in their development when sponsors become hesitant in the provision of future funding.
To secure continuity, there must be a clear case that the LEA is making a valuable contribution to the local economy.
This study focuses on IPSENTA (the Ipswich Enterprise Agency) and aims to assess its impact on the local economy.
It is designed to fit closely with the national study conducted by the Centre for Employment Initiatives (1984) to facilitate the comparison of many of the results.
The methodology employs a structured mail survey for four randomly sampled categories (Clients, Sponsors, Informed Community Observers, Non-Users) to elicit views on the performance of the Agency.
The research does not limit itself to quantitative performance measures (eg number and cost of jobs created) but utilises the richness of qualitative yardsticks.
From the high response levels it was clear that IPSENTA rated highly on Client Satisfaction, was strongly recommended by both sponsors and informed community members, and compared favourably with other LEAs in terms of the numbers of new start-up firms and their survivability.
It was slightly weaker than other LEAs on measures of relative performance and on its ability to change attitudes and behaviour of the community towards small firms.
The research has provided a basis for the future assessment of specific LEAs and the comparability of the results with a major national survey of 13 other LEAs makes them more generally applicable.

Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) have recently moved towards an increased use of overseas R&D units in their overall technology programmes.
To date the analysis of this has focused mainly on the roles played by these units in the MNEs' approach to global strategy, and the administrative procedures adopted to use them effectively.
However, other important issues arise in terms of the consequences of MNEs' overseas R&D facilities for the host countries in which they operate.
This research will investigate the implications of foreign-controlled MNE labs in the UK.
Such foreign-controlled labs may help adapt or develop products and/or production processes to better conform to local conditions.
This may benefit consumers and local employment.
Beyond these direct consequences such labs have implications for the long term development of the host-country's scientific capacity and capability.
Whilst they may compete quality scientists away from local firms, they may also enhance their knowledge and broaden their research horizons and perceptions.
These concerns are most intense in labs which do basic (precompetitive) research, as part of the MNE's global programme, rather than support local production/marketing.
Here there may be a strong interaction with other areas of the local service-base, e.g. universities, industry research labs etc.
The extent of this, and its implications for local science, are a key element in the project investigations.

For some twenty years now, environmental economists have argued that the most efficient way for society to control pollution is through the use of ‘market mechanisms’.
These mechanisms include pollution taxes and tradeable pollution permits.
Using such mechanisms, it is argued, will use up fewer scarce resources to achieve a particular reduction in pollution than the more usually adopted ‘command and control’ mechanisms, such as design and performance standards.
This theory has been much refined, and has also been empirically tested using computer simulations.
These simulations require economists to work in tandem with water and air-quality scientists.
However, many question over the effectiveness of market mechanisms remain.
This project addresses four such questions, which are all addressed to a particular case study, the Forth Estuary and catchment in central Scotland.
First, how big are the efficiency savings for a number of different pollutants?
Second, what is the effect of having imperfectly competitive permit markets?
Third, does the control of so-called ‘non- point’ pollutants from forestry and farmland pose special problems; and finally, what do we know about the benefits of pollution reduction in this case?

The process of labour market adjustment is central to the reallocation of resources and subsequent employment expansion which are the goals of macroeconomic policy in developing countries.
The inflexibility of wages is often presented as the main explanation of unsuccessful macroeconomic policy in developing countries.
In the literature on macroeconomic policy and labour markets, one finds considerable debate over degree of employment mobility and wage flexibility at the enterprise level.
With this goes the argument that small enterprises tend to be more efficient than larger ones, both in their use of scarce resources and the flexibility of their response to market processes.
One finds in this approach a judgement about the effects of trade union and state interventions in labour markets with regard to resource allocation.
Namely, it is argued that small enterprises tend to be less unionized and therefore characterised by competitively-set. flexible wages, while large enterprises are characterised by wage rigidity.
This study investigates whether there is prima facie support for this view, through a statistical analysis of wage and employment changes, disaggregated by sectors of manufacturing and size of enterprises for approximately 8-10 developing countries over two decades.
The analysis will isolate the effects on wages and employment of the following: sector of industry, size of establishment, concentration of production by sector, and country; and, by country, to investigate this over time.

It is now known that the majority of standard statistical procedures used in the construction and evaluation of quantitative economic (and other) models, are sensitive to whether or not the data series to which they are applied are stable or unstable.
For example, in examining the relationship between aggregate consumer spending and aggregate disposable income, it is important to determine whether or not , over a period of years, the spending and income data tend to fluctuate around a regular trend, or have a tendency to wander far away from their trend.
Statistical tests, known as unit root tests, have been developed to discriminate between these two cases.
The correct interpretation of the outcome of any such test is necessary to ensure that appropriate techniques are used in subsequent analysis.
The project will use simulation methods to explore the merits or otherwise of basing decisions about the stability of data series on the outcome of several such tests.
Also investigate will be the value of conducting sequences of tests, as is now common in empirical research in this area.
An attempt will be made to identify best practice, to help bridge the gap between theoretical prescriptions and practical modelling procedures.

The purpose of this research is to analyse developments in French industrial policy and planning over the period 1983-86.
The incoming Socialist government announced its intentions to link industrial policy with planning and macro-policy.
The original intention was to use the newly nationalised industries as a vehicle for reflation, on the assumption that the underlying economic situation genuinely justified investment, while private entrepreneurs held off.
It was also intended to use industrial policy as a tool to relax the balance of payments constraint on the economy.
The aim of the research is to study the way the government has attempted to combine the various objectives, which, despite much talk in the past, have never been seriously linked, as planning had more or less disappeared over the period 1970-81.
The situation has changed substantially since the policies (and the research programme) were conceived.
On the one hand by 1983 the straight-forward expansionist strategy has been virtually abandoned, but on the other side the French authorities are striving to sustain an active supply-side policy to prevent the fabric of industry being destroyed during what is supposed to be a temporary period of demand restraint caused by international financial problems.
The research will be based on collection of documentation and interviews in France.

The 1983 Energy Act deregulated electricity supply and followed government initiatives to deregulate sectors such as express coaching, telecoms apparatus and gas.
The Energy Act abolished the public sector's monopoly and allowed private companies to generate electricity as a main business.
Private generators could either sell direct to final customers by leasing the use of the public sector's transmission network (the Act guaranteed access on specified terms) or they could sell to the public sector electricity industry (the Act required purchase to take place on specified terms).
In practice few companies have made use of the opportunity provided by the Act to start generating electricity on a substantial scale.
The study investigated two alternative explanations of this comparative dearth of market entry; the two alternatives have very different implications for policy.
The first hypothesis is that the public sector is highly efficient in producing electricity and is able to realise the economies of large scale production.
In consequence there has not been an opportunity for profitable market entry by efficient private companies.
The second hypothesis is that profitable entry has been deterred by the existence of barriers to entry which have arisen either as a result of actions by the incumbent public sector supplier or as a result of the technical characteristics of electricity supply.
The role of ‘strategic entry deterrence’ by an incumbent firm in preventing the entry of potential competitors into a market is well established in economic theory.
It seems to be particularly applicable to markets where the relaxation of statutory entry restrictions leave an incumbent firm with an especially predominant position.
The study investigated the two hypotheses empirically by analysing the conditions relating to market entry (in particular the prices which potential entrants can expect to obtain for their products) and by investigating cases where entry has taken place.
The study went on to evaluate, on the basis of the conclusions reached on the impact of the Energy Act, the costs and benefits of more fundamental re-structuring of the public sector electricity supply industry.

The main objectives of the research are to estimate the total compliance costs of personal income tax and capital gains tax in the UK, ie the costs incurred by taxpayers over and above their tax liability.
It is intended to compare these costs with tax revenue; to examine their incidence; and to identify the particular areas and causes of high compliance costs.
Any advantages which accrue to taxpayers as a result of complying with income tax obligations are also being examined and where possible quantified.
For example, a self-employed businessman may make use in his business of the accounting information he prepares for tax reasons.
Administrative costs incurred by the Inland Revenue are also being considered, as will any other cost to the Exchequer associated with delays in obtaining payment of tax.
An estimate of the total operating costs of the tax (administrative plus compliance costs), and recommendations on how they may be reduced are being made.
The principal methods of investigation are a pre-piloted anonymous survey of taxpayers, drawn with the co-operation of the Inland Revenue, and an interview survey of professional tax advisers.
This survey follows earlier investigations of compliance costs of VAT and PAYE which were supported by ESRC.

There has been little empirical work done on the amount of substitution through time amongst the various resources used by the hospital sector.
Largely this arises from the lack of adequate time-series data on resource levels.
This study examines specific resources — various types of labour, capital and materials — used by the hospital sector to quantify the degree of substitution that has occurred over the period 1951 to 1981.
Trends in resource use and cost will also be analysed.
The data relate to data previously collected for the Scottish hospital sector by one of the authors.
The results should be of relevance to policy makers interested in resource use in the NHS.

According to the recently published Seventh Plan and other sources nearly 40% of Indians live below the subsistence based poverty level.
This is in spite of an impressive set of measures, associated with the Integrated Rural Development Programme, to reduce poverty at the same time as encouraging economic development.
In particular, those programmes do little for the two lowest income deciles of the population.
Does it make any sense to encourage Western style ‘social security’ in the Indian context where only a small proportion of the population is currently covered?
What is the relationship between poverty relief and the various schemes for employment generation?
Is there a role for ‘voluntary’, family-based welfare provision?
The purpose of the visit was to discuss those matters with Indian researchers mainly in Delhi, to explore the literature and to devise a more detailed programme of research.
During the period of the visit, Professor Collard was a Visting Professor at the Delhi School of Economics.

Britain and France are close, not only geographically, but also strategically.
Since World War II, they have both surrendered empires, acquired nuclear forces, fought distant wars, maintained troops in Germany, and devoted a larger share of output to defence than the European average.
While the strategic similarities make comparison meaningful, the policy differences make it revealing.
France has grown faster; maintained a different balance between nuclear and conventional forces; followed a different arms export policy; pursued autonomy from the US; and spent less on defence in relation to GDP.
A detailed comparison should thus illuminate the costs and benefits of the choices made by the two countries.
Within this framework, the project examines the evolution of military structure and budget; the economic effects of military expenditure; and the links between arms production and industrial structure.
The project involves both quantitative econometric analysis and more qualitative historical and institutional studies.

This project is being undertaken by teams of British and French economists working in close collaboration.
It will examine the design of macroeconomic policy in developed Western economies with strong trade and financial links.
It looks at the impact a nation's economic performance has on the economies of other nations' (‘spillover' effects) and at the strategic policy responses which such spillover effects may induce.
The increasing degree of integration of the world economy in both financial and real markets has made spillovers progressively more pronounced.
The focus is on relationships among European countries as well as on the relation between Europe and the outside world, particularly the US.
The research will first examine the issues theoretically and then, where feasible, with the aid of existing macroeconomic models.
In studying the political economy of policy coordination, the team will compare and contrast the results of non-cooperative and cooperative behaviour and will consider the institutional framework which cooperation may require.
The EC is a topical example of regional cooperation, which was initially a free trade area and has since evolved a European Monetary System, combining different inflation rates with relatively stable real exchange rates.
Recent movements of the dollar and yen by contrast appear to reflect the absence of international policy coordination.

Nicholas Kaldor is one of the most original and influential economic thinkers of the twentieth century.
He has made important innovations in several areas notably in the theory of the firm; welfare economics; taxation; trade cycle theory; growth and distribution theory, and above all, in his challenge to equilibrium theory.
In addition he has been an important public figure with a significant influence on public policy in several countries, including the United Kingdom.
The emphasis of the research is on Kaldor's writing and thinking rather than on his life in the biographical sense, although there are distinct phases in his intellectual life that can be easily identified.
Briefly, the development of his thought is traced from his earliest days at the LSE under the influence of Hayek and Robbins, through his conversion to Keynesianism, and his extension of Keynesian analysis and modes of thinking to growing capitalist economies.
There are explorations of his war-time activities; his work for Beveridge and the Economic Commission for Europe; his work as a tax adviser in developing countries; his proposals for tax reform in the UK; his original views on the functioning of the world economy and his theoretical contributions mentioned above.

Developing countries, particularly oil exporters, embarked on unprecedented, ambitious public investment programmes in the 1970s.
Large-scale natural resource-based industrial (RBI) projects such as steel, aluminium and petrochemical plants accounted for a significant fraction of these investments.
The RBI projects were expected to supplement, and in some cases replace, foreign exchange earned by crude oil, and to promote industrial growth and economic diversification.
This research examines the RBI strategies of four pairs of mid-size and small developing countries: Indonesia/Malaysia; Saudi Arabia/ Bahrain; Nigeria/Cameroon; and Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago.
It evaluates the roles of country size, enterprise efficiency and macroeconomic policy in determining the successful implementation of RBI projects based on four natural resources (oil, gas, iron ore and bauxite).
The extent to which the RBI projects fell short of expectations is estimated.
The poor performance of the RBI projects is explained and policy implications are determined for the developing countries and also for the global steel, aluminium and petrochemical industries.

Economic forecasting
Forecasts of the future state of the economy are produced by many agencies, including several which use economic models supported by ESRC funds.
The purpose of this project is to analyse some of these forecasts and discover their similarities and differences.
For example, many forecasts of the future rate of inflation are published, varying from predictions from complex econometric models to simple extrapolations from graphs.
Alternative ways of combining these forecasts (such as averaging) are to be examined.
If the forecasts are believed, they will affect the actions of agents and so take on the role of expectations.
This will be considered in the context of wage and interest-rate equations.
This also has implications for econometric models since most of the existing models do not take account of knowledge of published forecasts.
The final area of study is that of data revisions.
It is well known that published economic statistics are subject to revision at a later date so that the current view of where we are now may be misleading.
Forecasts from econometric models will be inaccurate if the data on which they are based are wrong.
The extent to which this has occurred is to be investigated.

This project has two principal aims.
The first is to contribute to the theoretical analysis of work and employment and to discussions of labour markets, and to advance our understanding of the ways in which gender operates at work.
The second is to analyse the ways in which women's employment has been affected by the recession in France and Great Britain.
Despite the substantial growth in studies of women's employment over the past decade, very little comparative analysis has been undertaken in this area.
This project will endeavour to integrate discussion of theoretical work, empirical case studies and official statistics in order to establish a basis for cross-national research.
The project will consist of four seminars at which researchers working in different disciplines in both countries will meet together in order to develop this analysis.

The purpose of this research is to analyse the role that commodity taxes (VAT and excise duties) can play both in raising government revenue and in redistributing income towards the poorer sections of society, taking account of the fact that households differ widely in their size and composition.
Household composition is important for two reasons.
First, large numbers of children can be a significant cause of poverty.
Second, households with different compositions will have different patterns of demand, even if they have the same income.
Thus changes in commodity taxes will affect the distribution of real income between households according to their composition.
These points have been recognised in a practical way by the existing UK tax structure, for example the zero rate of VAT on children's clothing.
This project looks at whether such policies of non-uniform taxation are an efficient way of redistributing income.
It will consider a wide range of redistributive and revenue raising goals and, in each case, will use data from the UK Family Expenditure Survey and estimates of the effects of price changes on demand to calculate taxes which achieve these goals with the smallest distortionary effects on the economy.

This project aims to develop a tool which will allow policy makers to analyse systematically the impact of changes to income taxation and to the benefits which provide income support.
Such changes are likely to give rise to changes in living standards and to household working behaviour.
The methodology employed is to estimate the sensitivity of household decisions about working to changes in their economic circumstances, and to use these models to simulate the effects of tax and benefit changes on a large sample of households from the Family Expenditure Survey.
It is then possible to compare the post reform situation with the actual situation in terms of the distribution of living standards across households, average living standards, and incentives to work.
The computer programmes which generate the simulations and diagnose their effects are written in such a way that almost any conceivable tax/benefit reform can be analysed.
For example, abolishing the married man allowance and increasing child benefit; merging taxes and benefits into a negative income tax; abolishing mortgage interest relief and increasing personal allowances; or simply changing the tapers on means tested benefits are all amenable to analysis.

Relationships between oil companies and host Governments have frequently been uneasy and sometimes open conflicts have developed.
Such conflicts are generally not in the long-term interests of either party: the deterioration in the investment climate adversely affects the interests of both parties.
This research project examines the contractual relationships between oil companies and Governments in the UK, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands since the early 1970s.
The main purpose is to investigate the relevant legislation and regulations with a view to determining the extent to which the terms are inherently unstable in the context of the objectives of the two parties within a changing economic and political environment.
The object is then to discover the form and structure of contractual relationships which are likely to be more robust and stable within this changing environment.
The research encompasses licensing, taxation and depletion policies.
Field abandonment legislation and regulation are also included.
Computerised financial models are employed to analyse the behaviour of the fiscal systems in the four countries to test whether they are likely to be consistent with the objectives of the parties in the changing operating environment.
The legislative and regulatory framework applied to gas exploration is also included in the study.

Recently there has been increasing recognition of the importance of tax operating costs, both administrative costs to the government and compliance costs to taxpayers and third parties.
The main objectives of this research are to estimate the total costs of operating the tax system; to estimate the benefits accruing to businesses as a result of the operation of the system (particularly cash flow benefits); to compare costs of operating the main taxes; and to identify areas of high compliance costs with a view to their reduction.
Results will be published in a book covering the whole field of tax administration and compliance, and in additional articles.
The researchers have examined the costs of personal income tax and capital gains tax; PAYE and National Insurance; VAT; and excises in tobacco and alcoholic drinks in earlier studies.
Data obtained will be updated (and supplemented where necessary) to provide estimates of 1986/87 costs.
Additional surveys will be made of corporation tax, oil revenues and local rates; lesser taxes such as Capital Transfer Tax will also be examined.
The principal survey method will be mail surveys supplemented with interviews with companies, accountants, trade bodies and revenue departments.
The team is completely independent, but will maintain close co-operation with Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue.

This continuing research, known as the Cambridge Growth Project, aims to study the structure and future prospects of the British economy quantitatively in as great detail as practicable.
The approach of the project has been to develop a computable disaggregated model of the economy which differs from, for example, the Treasury model of distinguishing as many as 39 industries and a comparable level of detail in other sectors of the economy.
The model is estimated from annual time-series data and the periodic cross-section data available in the Input-Output tables.
(A) Applications of the Model
(i)
Synthesis of economic policy
The optimisation methodology used by the project for the formulation of economic policy now incorporates three approaches.
The first is a steering approach and formulates disequilibrium policy by minimising a quadratic welfare loss criterion subject to the constraints of a large nonlinear econometric model.
The second approach allows medium-term planning exercises by maximising a general welfare criterion subject to inequality constraints on key target variables and excessive policy manipulations.
The third approach rejects the framework of one centralised decision maker and allows for the calculation of a dynamic non-regrettable Nash equilibrium for multiple agents with competing objectives.
The latter approach takes account of rational expectations, achieved through pre-play round-table discussion, and a policy-variant structure of the economy.
(ii)
Design of economic policy
So far all the work on policy optimisation procedures has been restricted to the time domain.
Possibilities for design of economic policy in the frequency domain will be investigated.
Advantages of such an approach would be that reaction functions for policy are obtained in feedback format, that due attention is paid to dynamics and that explicit specification of a welfare criterion is avoided.
An immediate application is to exchange rate formation.
(iii)
Ex Post forecasting
An important use of a forecasting model is ex post simulation of the period of estimation.
This possibility has existed since the model became dynamic in 1976; with increased flexibility and resources it may now be possible to move towards a full-scale tracking exercise.
(iv)
Structural dynamics over the business cycle
Part of this ex post forecasting could distinguish the various phases of post-1954 business cycles with respect to their particular characteristics in terms of changes in the sectoral/industrial composition of the UK economy and with respect to the specific features of the different industries' behaviour in terms of stock movements, capacity utilisation, scrapping of old equipment, new investments, etc.
(B) Research into particular aspects of the economy
(i)
Financial behaviour
The current research on financial markets distinguishes four sectors (private, public, banks and overseas) and eight asset categories.
Once this version is operational and some experience has been gained in running the financial model in conjunction with the main model, the former will be extended in the following ways:
(a)
Further disaggregation of the sectors and in particular the private sector into one personal sector, industrial and commercial companies and non-bank financial companies.
(b)
Further disaggregation of the assets and three possible avenues of research suggest themselves.
First, to study in great detail the take-up by the personal sector of National Savings.
Secondly to investigate the behaviour of the gilts market.
Finally to investigate the equity market with reference to the shares issued by specific companies or industries relative to their need for finance and the availability of alternative sources of finance.
(c)
The life assurance funds are the major vehicle for personal saving.
Their behaviour conforms to fairly well-known principles and it should therefore be possible to estimate a perpetual inventory model which will show, for example, increased saving if the real value of their assets falls as deficiencies are made up.
(ii)
Government expenditure and endogenous government behaviour
A related question which affects the projections of Government expenditure is the extent to which projections of the saving behaviour of the household sector (and also the composition of its expenditure) can be improved by taking more explicit account of projected changes in the demographic structure of the sector.
Changes in the relative numbers of the different types of household that make up the aggregate population have actuarial consequences for the future pattern of public and private transfers into and out of collective saving and insurance funds.
However, not all components of public expenditure are committed in advance.
The remaining components of public expenditure and other instruments of economic policy depend very much on political factors, such as the actions of the incumbent political party, the opposition and other pressure groups, and possibly the onset of a General Election.
An explanation of political popularity and elections seems important for medium-term forecasting, since it is one way of endogenising economic policy.
(iii)
Distribution of income
Empirical departures from the aggregate Keynesian consumption function have taken either of two routes.
First, in some models, income is distinguished by source on the grounds that different sorts of incomes are received by different sorts of persons and they in turn would have different propensities to consume.
Secondly, in other applications, income is distinguished by its permanence (or lack of permanence).
In modelling consumer's expenditure, the project follows the latter route which has a good theoretical pedigree.
(iv)
Differential pricing
Studies of differences between published price indices and transactions prices have assumed that all the variables used in calculating the transactions prices are error free.
Using balanced constant and current price accounts it will be possible to derive differential prices for sales of commodities to intermediate and various types of final demand which satisfy accounting relationships.
(v)
The external sector and the exchange rate
It is proposed to re-estimate the export sector using a world regional disaggregation more suited to current patterns of trade than the present one in the model.
On the exchange rate, it is proposed to explore the model formulation and empirical testing of the importance of ‘news’ in explaining exchange rate changes.

Individual industry studies
The model can be viewed as a set of linked industry models.
Certain industries because of data problems or their particular role, for example construction and distribution, are worth studying in detail, in as much as they have an important impact on the properties of the overall model.
A specification of Multi-Sectoral Dynamic Model will be developed in terms of its component industries.

Adam Smith made a profound and surprising claim: an economy in which millions of individuals pursue their own interests without any central direction would not be chaotic but orderly.
Later economists argued that such an economy would also be efficient in a precise sense.
Smith noted certain exceptional tasks (army) which must be left to government and stressed the need for laws to deal with monopoly.
After the War, this central theory of economics was put on a rigorous footing (Arrow-Debreu).
It became clear that while Smith's claim was logically valid in an abstract world, it was unlikely to be so in the world.
That is because its validity required
(a)
agents to have more information that they can sensibly be taken to have,
(b)
the possibility of full insurance against any contingency,
(c)
the absence of increasing returns and externalities and
(d)
a very large number of competing firms and a very large number of households.
For instance, if there is no present market for the delivery of cars one year hence conditional on a certain oil price then neither car firms nor consumers can co-ordinate their actions by means of a market as Smith suggested, nor can they insure.
It will be seen that these matters are of importance in both judging and understanding a market economy.
The research of this project is directed to the construction of theoretical means for the study of such an economy without the disabling restrictions
(a)
to
(d)
.
Thus the project has studied information transmission through prices, institutional substitutes for missing insurance markets (labour contracts), imperfect and oligopolistic markets in an economy-wide setting, liquidity as a means of self insurance and the role of the stock market in providing possibilities for insurance.
The aim is to bring the theory of a market economy closer to reality.

Uncertainties about future income, and its real value once inflation is taken into account, are likely to affect how hard people work, how much they save, and whether their savings are held in the form of money or as less liquid assets.
Unfortunately, theory gives no clear-cut guide as to how precisely these decisions will be changed by increased uncertainty.
Savings may rise as a precaution against the worst happening in the future; or they may fall, since the future real value of savings cannot be guaranteed.
This study proposes to settle such questions empirically.
The idea is to develop quantitative measures of uncertainties about future income and prices using the results of the regular surveys of consumer confidence which have been conducted over the past decade.
These measures will then be introduced into conventional econometric models of labour supply, consumption and savings, and money demand, and the direction and size of their effects measured.
The results should prove useful in understanding and forecasting household sector behaviour, and the behaviour of related variables such as wages and real interest rates.

Despite the existence of some domestic deposits of coal and uranium and the exploitation of North Sea oil and natural gas, the countries of the European Community continue to be net importers of energy.
Hence security of supply continues to be a major objective of Community energy policy.
This has meant attempting to diversify energy imports with regard to the nature and the location of sources as well as achieving and maintaining the best possible balance between stability and flexibility in supply arrangements.
At present, contracts are used for almost all energy trade and the countries of the Community cannot be indifferent to the contractual arrangements under which they secure the energy on which they depend.
Recent years have seen a good deal of change and instability in energy markets and the aim of the study is to investigate how these have influenced, or have been influenced by, the form of contractual behaviour in the markets.
It is anticipated that the study will provide conclusions highly relevant to the design of policy measures intended to promote market stability and access to supplies.
It may also help us to understand how, in these important commodity markets, issues relating to the utility of contract and the nature of contractual obligations have been developed.
The study is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department of Law at the European University Institute in Florence and follows an earlier pilot study, of the international iron ore market carried out in 1982-83, supported by the ESRC.
The principal method of investigation is a survey by mail questionnaire of major traders in the markets, supplemented by interviews, together with a general investigation of changes in market structure.

The UK system of income taxation and income support measures has been the subject of criticism from many quarters for a variety of reasons.
The aim of this research is to employ models of household behaviour to analyse the distributional implications and effects on efficiency of tax/benefit reforms.
The behavioural models are estimated by econometric methods applied to the Family Expenditure Survey data sets.
The effects of reforms are analysed using a computerized simulation routine which calculate the tax rates that households face under a reform and predicts the incentive effects of the changes and the consequences for household living standards.
The project concentrates on the accurate modelling of female labour market behaviour because it is known to be considerably more sensitive to changes in the structure of incentives than is the case for males.
The simulation routine will be developed further to facilitate comprehensive analyses of radical reforms as well as of changes in the parameters underlying the present tax/benefit system.
More complex developments will involve the empirical analysis of household expenditure decisions as well as their labour market behaviour, and of the behaviour of the unemployed.
These extensions will facilitate the analysis of the effects of changes in the structure of commodity taxes and of unemployment benefits.
Developments of the simulation routines will also involve their implementation on a microcomputer to allow other researchers to pursue their own ideas on tax reform.

For over fifty years selected local bus operators have been given monopoly rights on their routes in return for which they are subject to fares control and expected to plough back any profits from good services to maintain loss-making routes.
In 1980 the government completely deregulated express buses and introduced some experiments in deregulation of local buses on the grounds that the protection induced inefficiency by the selected operators, and, by causing fares to be higher and services poorer than would otherwise be the case on the more profitable routes, accentuated the move to the car and the further decline of public transport.
The 1985 Transport Bill extends deregulation to all buses.
In urban areas deregulation may have the effects of encouraging smaller vehicles and hence increasing congestion, of destroying the benefits of integration of the network, and of causing losses of service in some areas and particularly at evenings and weekends.
It is also feared that competitive operating practices may be adopted which are wasteful and unsafe.
This research programme will monitor the impacts of the change in order to identify its effects on the efficiency with which services are provided and to examine the distribution of its impact on the travelling public.

The Liverpool Research Group has evolved out of the ESRC-financed Liverpool Project investigating the international transmission mechanism.
The project, which began in October 1977 aimed to apply the rational expectations hypothesis and portfolio theory to linked macroeconomic models of the major organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies.
There have been two main fruits of this endeavour.
The first, which is the furthest in development, is the UK model.
This has been in existence in an annual version since early 1978, and was first used for UK forecasting in March 1980, and has recently had an aggregate ‘supply-side’ added (this determining the equilibrium values of output, unemployment and relative prices).
Products of this research include a quarterly version of this model and the world annual model, which has been used for a variety of policy regimes including the EMS version.
The Theoretical basis of the Liverpool models
(a)
an inter-related set of private sector demands for stocks of money, government bonds (and net foreign assets), and durable goods and for a flow of nondurable consumption goods; these demands depend on wealth and real returns.
(b)
a government supply function of (narrow) money which together with the government and foreign sector budget constraints determines also the supply of bonds plus foreign assets.
(c)
efficient financial markets in the operational sense that expected returns are equated across domestic and international financial assets.
(d)
rational expectation which is implemented operationally by using the model's forecasts as the expectations.
(e)
the supply of output is modelled via a price equation derived from an aggregate production function as a mark-up over costs which varies with the level of output.
(f)
the labour market has a significantly large union sector, the non-union sector clears continuously (at levels heavily influenced by social security benefits).
Aggregating together union and non-union wages and substituting out firms' demand for labour, one may obtain a reduced real wage equation positively related to output, lagged real wages and employer taxes on labour and negatively to unexpected inflation benefits and employee taxes.
Hence if there is unanticipated inflation, real wages fall, and so do output costs; the supply curve of output therefore shifts outwards temporarily.
In subsequent periods, real wages gradually return to equilibrium, and the output with it.
(g)
The current account external balance depends on the real exchange rate (defined as domestic relative to foreign consumer prices and adjusted for the exchange rate) and domestic and foreign ‘absorption’(total final expenditure).

Many investment decisions, both in the private and the public sector, require assumptions about the state of the economy 10-15 years ahead.
Government policy and company policy alike have to take a view of long term trends and possibilities, particularly in a future period that may see the UK's decline as an oil exporter.
To look into the future and explore questions related to the long-term development of the economy; this is the aim of the project.
What level of total resources will be available and to what uses will they be put?
These are the two basic questions.
The main concern is the prospect for long-term growth of the economy.
The labour supply (including such important aspects as participation, working hours, retirement age, etc) labour productivity and the role of new technology, structural changes affecting investment trends and other areas such as training, will also be dealt with in some detail.
What pattern of output by industry might be compatible with the restoration of full employment (in the range of, say, 3-5 per cent unemployed)— and does this seem feasible?
A central issue would be the implications of the expected decline of oil production, which must be matched by the rise of some alternative source of export earnings or import savings.
Much depends on world developments, on the rate of expansion of other countries, on the availability and price of fuels and raw materials; projections and assumptions in these areas will provide the foreseeable environment to the UK economy.

The project builds on two recent trends in applied economic and econometric research.
The first is the development of various aspects of modelling individual behaviour including the quantification of the welfare implications of changes in taxes and prices.
The second is the increased use of large, detailed microdata sets.
The data base which will be used is the annual Family Expenditure Survey for the fourteen years 1970-1983 — a total of some 100,000 households.
Domestic demand for fuel is an important subject as regards both the economy in aggregate and the welfare of individual households: the domestic sector accounts for nearly 30% of total final energy use in the UK.
Additional interest is generated by the large and varying changes in the real price of different fuels over the 1970s and early 1980s and by the question as to how this has affected different households.
Previous research into the response of domestic energy expenditure to changing prices has concentrated almost entirely on the use of aggregate data.
This means that the emphasis on modelling demand for fuels at the level of the individual household will, in itself be novel, and will allow account to be taken of the enormous variation that exists in household income, demographic characteristics and appliance stocks.

As econometric models are widely used for policy evaluation and forecasting the economy's performance, it is important that their construction should be well founded.
Because the prevalent methods of handling seasonality, in particular the use of seasonally adjusted variables, are ad hoc they tend to distort the structure of these models.
The basic premise of the project is that an economic variable's seasonal pattern arises from a corresponding pattern in the behaviour of the economic agents.
From this perspective the seasonality is an integral part of the economic structure and should be accordingly modelled.
The research concentrates on consumer expenditure and in this context includes both theoretical and empirical elements.
Theoretical models are constructed to analyse the relationship between the desire for seasonally varying levels of expenditure and the associated pattern in consumer debt and savings.
A thorough empirical evaluation of the research's hypothesis is carried out in the context of total consumer expenditure and its various components.

Government services account for approximately the same share of national output as manufacturing.
Whereas changes in real manufacturing output are measured directly in the national income accounts, changes in government output are measured almost exclusively by reference to changes in government employment.
It follows first that there can be no measured change in productivity, irrespective of whether government productivity grows in practice, and secondly that the relative price of government services tends to rise over time.
The study is re- examining the national accounts measurement of government services; it argues that most public servants in fact do things which can be measured and it provides some alternative estimates for real output growth in education, health and public administration (which compares well with broadly analogous private financial services).
The study also investigates the system of performance management and measurement within certain central government departments and in a sample of large firms.
It broadly finds that the systems being developed within government compare reasonably well with those in the private sector, although some firms are well ahead of the rest and government.

The central objectives are to establish how Britain's productivity compares with that of other advanced countries, to elucidate the factors contributing to the differences and to examine policy implications.
There are important issues arising about the complementarities between fixed investment and training.
Following on earlier work, sample products will be chosen and plants matched in Britain and Germany to clarify how productivity is affected at shop-floor level by differences in types of machinery and workforce skills.
Attention will be paid to the treatment of breakdowns, the role of technical skills in the choice and use of machinery and the nature of training.
At a later stage the study will be extended to differences in office skills.
Econometric work on UK/US productivity differences will examine, for example, the impact of capital intensity, plant-size, international competition and labour relations as well as the qualifications of the labour force.

The Wildlife and Countryside Act has fuelled controversy over the kinds and quantities of species and habitats to be protected and conserved, and the best means to achieve this.
Whilst the costs of conservation can be measured relatively easily (for example, the direct costs of site management or the production possibilities if the land were used for agriculture or forestry), there are almost no tangible measures of the benefits of conservation.
This project will estimate the benefits and costs of wildlife habitats and compare the results using different valuation techniques.
Selected habitats will be studied and data collected on the ‘costs’ of conservation, for example in financial (compensation payments) and social opportunity cost (foregone production) terms; but the main research effort will examine the ‘benefits’of sites by studying
(a)
demand and recreational use by club members (Wildlife Trusts), the general public and experts/scientists, and
(b)
willingness to pay by the public to conserve sites even though no recreational or other use is planned.
Research methods will include visitor and other public attitude surveys, allowing the development of models of individual choice to be used as a basis for appraising future endangered habitats.

Two features of the British economy which have become especially noteworthy over the years 1980-85 are the very rapid rise in unemployment and the continued rise in real wages (ie wages after allowance for price changes).
There are a number of econometric models estimates recently, each of which has aimed to explain these twin events.
One gap which exists in this range of alternatives, is that there has been no testing of the view that the explanation for recent events lies in the non-clearing nature of the labour market.
According to this approach, employment and real wages show a systematic tendency to diverge from what would be produced by the simple pressures of demand and supply of labour.
There may be many reasons for such divergencies, including the lack of information among workers about employment opportunities.
The present project aims to fill this gap, by estimating and evaluating a non-clearing model of the UK labour market, using quarterly data.
Emphasis is placed on how successfully the approach accounts for the events of the last five years.

The early years in work are of great importance.
Training may be undergone, qualifications gained, and patterns of work on unemployment set up which form the basis for habits and expectations in adult life.
Despite this, and despite the current political interest in the age group, little is known about young people's early careers and their effect on later achievement.
The research uses data from the National Child Development Study, a long term follow-up study of all children born in GB in one week in 1958, contact having been kept with 12,500 young people up to age 23.
The study has detailed information on both employment history and a whole range of aspects relating to parental background, home life and education, together with other important events in early adulthood, such as marriage and childbirth.
To this will be added data about local economic conditions.
The analysis of these data will combine up-to-date statistical techniques with theoretical concepts drawn from both economics and sociology.
Among the topics to be explored are the choice made at 16 between the various options available, the effect of marriage and childbirth on the career progress of both men and women, and the factors which explain occupational success and income by age 23 among people who left school at 16.

This programme is concerned with the adjustments and responses in the world economy elicited by the oil price shocks of the 1970s.
The occurrence of these shocks raises questions about the performance of the world petroleum market, which are being studied using the theory of bargaining approach.
The aims of this project are twofold.
First, to provide an analytical account of market developments and structural changes with special emphasis on recent history and the role of institutions.
Secondly, to appraise the current strategies of various participants in the market and to propose alternative strategies.
Recent thinking on how markets can be affected by bargaining modes will be examined, and, whenever necessary, developed and adapted for possible application to an analysis of the petroleum market.

Most empirical economic models involve reactions which take place over time.
A major problem confronting the interpretation and use of such models for forecasting and analysis is the extent to which observed time lags directly represent backward looking behaviour, or indirectly reflect attempts to anticipate the future.
For example, in explaining wages, past prices could represent genuine lags in wage bargains responding to past inflation.
Alternatively, negotiators may form a view about likely inflation over the period of the wage contract based on its recent past behaviour.
In practice, both sets of factors probably play a role while their relative importance varies between markets.
Thus, in the stock market, expectations predominate, whereas for non-durable consumers' goods and services, habits are more important.
This research seeks to understand and separate out the respective ‘backward looking’ and ‘forward looking’aspects of economic behaviour in a variety of applications including housing, labour and consumer goods markets.
The main products of the research will comprise new models of the interactions between lags and expectations, empirical studies of the success of such models relative to already established results, new econometrics tools for evaluating models, and working computer programmes with their documentation to enable other researchers to test the findings and try out related methods.

The trade cycle in Britain since the 1950's follows a rather regular pattern over time, the typical period from peak to peak, or trough to trough, being four to six years.
The purpose of this project is to investigate the reasons for that regularity.
The aim of the study is not simply descriptive.
If the cyclical pattern is systematic, this will have implications both for economic forecasting and for policy analysis.
In this context, special interest is attached to the role of fiscal and monetary policy in the generation of cycles.
Some preliminary work is reported in the Institute's Discussion Papers No 62 and No 72.

The official method of measuring the stock of real capital — buildings, plant and machinery — in this and other countries relies on the availability of capital expenditure data over a number of years and on the assumption of average lengths of life for the various types of asset.
Currently there is concern that accelerated rates of scrappings of industrial assets, which may have occurred in the economic and financial conditions of recent years, could have distorted the valuation of Britain's capital stock.
The project seeks to determine, on the basis of a pilot scheme involving the cooperation of some 30 large companies, and the analysis of the accounts of almost 500 firms and organisations whether an alternative assessment of the size of the capital stock might be derived from rather more direct measures.
Two avenues, in particular, are being explored: the replacement cost of buildings, plant and machinery, based on fire insurance values; and current cost asset valuations contained in company accounts.

Taxes on addictive and potentially hazardous products like tobacco and alcohol produce a dual effect.
On the one hand these taxes represent a significant revenue source for the government, and on the other, they also generate a substantial stimulus to reduced consumption.
The main objective of this study is to quantify these effects with a view to predicting the impact of possible changes in tax rates.
This will be done primarily by evaluating the response of both demand and supply to tax changes in the past.
A further important objective of the study will be to assess the distribution of the burden of these taxes between consumers and producers and, to the extent that some of the burden falls on consumers, to identify its distribution between different income groups.

The Centre for Health Economics is a centre for research and training into the factors affecting the demand and supply of health and the consequences for the provision of health care.
There are a large number of research projects over a wide range of topics in health and health care: what health is and how it is to be valued, what influences health, the demand for and supply of health care, market equilibria and micro evaluation of treatments to system evaluation and the efficacy of planning, budgeting and monitoring mechanisms available to policy makers.
Measurement and valuation of health Investigators: A Williams, S Wright and Ms C Gudex
One study has interviewed 400 residents of York, asking about their health and attitudes and opinions about health.
The focus of analyses is on relative valuations at different points in the life cycle using scaling techniques developed within social psychology.
Another aim is to test how far it is possible, from the published results of existing clinical trials or other evaluation studies, to estimate the outcome of a wider range of health care activities in comparable terms, using the concept of ‘quality adjusted life years’.
Influences on health Investigators: R Carr-Hill and A Maynard
The main project here is an empirical investigation of the over-time relationship between health and income on the basis of a third phase follow-up of the Rowntree Children.
Approximately 950 households have now been traced and interviewed with ESRC.
These data are now being prepared for analysis with the help of a grant from the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust.
Research reviews have also been carried out of existing knowledge about inequalities between men and women and between the ethnic groups in the UK in respect of both health and health care.
Economics of nurse training Investigator: K Hartley
Nurses are the most expensive single resource in the hospital sector.
This project has explored the training process.
Who pays what costs and how are training costs shared between nurses, the DHSS and the NHS?
What are the benefits of training and how are these benefits shared between nurses and the health service?
Initial results have led to further exploration of the subsequent careers of nurses.
How long do they stay?
Where do they go?
Risk and uncertainty Investigators: G Loomes and Ms L Appleby
Many health care decisions involve elements (sometimes considerable) of risk and uncertainty.
Such decisions may have substantial implications for individual and social welfare and the allocation of scarce resources.
The project looks at how risk and uncertainty are handled by the decision makers concerned and what the impact may be on the choices made.
On the margins of the NHS Investigators: A Maynard, R Akehurst and Ms S Dowson
In view of the recent emphasis on community care as against hospital treatment, a priority area for research in the Centre was the analysis of the effects of financial systems at various interfaces both within the NHS and between the NHS and other services.
Work has concentrated on the margin between hospital and community assessment and treatment with consultants making domiciliary visits, between NHS and local authority social services in particular, which is affected by the use of Joint Finance funds, and between primary (especially general practitioner) care and the hospital system.

The project is jointly financed by ESRC, the Committee on Overseas Economic and Social Research of the Overseas Development Administration, and the International Development Research Centre, Canada.
A new generation of middle level developing countries is facing the difficult transition from being exporters of a few traditional commodities and receiving most external finance in the form of official aid to a varied pattern of trade and production, combined with use of more commerical loans or investment.
The success in the 1970s of a few Asian ‘Newly Industrialising Countries’(NICs) at making rapid growth in manufactured exports the key to rapid output growth, drew attention to the potential contribution of a ‘good’ external strategy.
But the international recession, the debt crisis, and the protectionist reaction to the NICs' success raised doubts about whether the 1970s strategy is still the best.
This project examines whether the differences in external conditions (and in the characteristics of countries themselves) alter their costs and benefits sufficiently to make it inappropriate for new NICs.
It also asks the more general question of how to choose a strategy in uncertain and changing conditions, in particular the trade-offs between a single-minded policy and a more diversified one.
The first stage of the project (financed by ESCOR) re-examined the conclusions drawn from the experience of the NICs to produce a more precise statement of what they achieved and what policies they followed, and compiled data on 25 new NICs.
In the present project, senior economists in Colombia, Peru, Malaysia, Thailand and Zimbabwe under the supervision of the investigator are examining the questions in the context of individual countries.
Their results and the data from the first stage will be used to test how far and in what way the experience of the NICs can be a model for their successors.

The report of the (then) Social Science Research Council's exploratory Panel on Addiction in 1982 argued that addiction problems are not trivial, that they are the legitimate concern of the social sciences and that a multi-disciplinary approach may reasonably be expected to produce insights, information and analyses which will enable addiction problems to be dealt with more effectively.
On the basis of the Panel's report, ESRC decided to support an initiative in relation to addictions.
The University of Hull, in association with the University of York, was selected as the site for an Addiction Research Centre.
The Centre was established in October 1983 and the overall direction of the five-year programme of work is the responsibility of Professor David Robinson, at the University of Hull and Professor Alan Maynard at the University of York.
The Addiction Research Centre's programme of work concentrates on issues of prevention and policy in relation to alcohol and tobacco.
The major concern is with the identification and minimization of impediments to co-ordinated national approaches to the prevention of alcohol and tobacco-related problems.
The programme of work is based on the assumption that it will have implications for addiction studies, policy studies, prevention studies and industrial studies generally, and for the particular disciplines that will be brought together in the Centre.
During Stage I of the programme, 1983-1986, three closely related projects are being conducted:
1 Current prevention policy
Investigators: L Harrison and P Tether
A wide range of statutory, non-statutory, commercial and other organisations are involved in some way with alcohol, tobacco and related problems.
In central government alone, for example, at least sixteen departments of state play a role in relation to some aspects of alcohol or tobacco production, their sale and distribution, their taxation and control, or the consequences of their consumption.
The aim of this project is:
(i)
to map out the main features of the current alcohol and tobacco prevention policies, and
(ii)
to identify impediments to the construction and implementation of co-ordinated national approaches.
2 The formation of prevention policy
Investigators: R Baggott and P Tether
The overall aims are to analyse the policy formation process and identify the political impediments to the formation and implementation of effective national alcohol and tobacco prevention strategies.
This project is concerned:
(i)
to identify the political and economic groups that have an incentive either to promote and support particular prevention policies or to obstruct and oppose them;
(ii)
to assess the relative importance of these groups by studying their role in the formation of particular policies and
(iii)
to determine the barriers to prevention policies that arise from present structures of decision making.
3 Industrial structures and activities
Investigators: Ms C Godfrey and G Hardman
The aim of this project is to analyse the economic effects of alternative prevention policies such as, for example , tax hikes, controls over advertising or sport sponsorship, changes in licensing laws or sales outlets, sustained public education campaigns etc.
It seeks:
(i)
to identify the effects of particular policies on production, employment, exports, profits, the Treasury and other factors in the alcohol and tobacco markets, and
(ii)
to assess the nature of the economic impediments to the implementation of particular prevention policies.
Stage II of the programme, 1986-1988, will bring together the Centre's various disciplines — social administration, economics, political science, policy analysis — in order to illuminate policy choices.
The precise foci of Stage II of the research will be settled on toward the end of Stage I in the light of the ideas, analyses and opportunities which will be available at that time.
The rationale of the overall programme of work is that it will have clear implications for policy and the prevention of problems associated with the consumption of addictive substances and clear implications also for the social sciences.
By the time Stage II of the work is concluded the ESRC Addiction Research Centre will have attempted:
(i)
to devise an administrative pattern and way of working in which different disciplines can make their own distinctive contributions to a common area of study;
(ii)
to identify a number of compatible ideas, procedures and concepts which will enable the work on one discipline to inform the work of others in the study of policy generally and addiction policy in particular; and
(iii)
to demonstrate the value of different social science disciplines being brought together to address issues of intellectual interest and national concern.

The object is to conduct an economic analysis of the world diamond market.
At the first stage of the project, a selective economic history of the industry over the last 120 years was compiled (B/00/23/2070).
At this second stage, various relevant economic theories will be adapted and applied to the industry and its sales monopoly.
These include the theories of durable goods monopoly, rent seeking, investing in a monopoly position, oligopoly, cartels, price stabilisation, and commodity bundling.
Recent events in the market are being examined as quantitatively as possible, with the object of analysing the forces determining the degree of price instability and of cartel coherence.

The aim of the research is to conduct an economic analysis of the world diamond industry, and in particular the regulatory role of the sales monopoly, the Central Selling Organisation.
The diamond industry, as probably the most successful cartel of the twentieth century, is of considerable interest to economists.
The research requires a study of, and explanation for, the evolution of the structure, organisation and behaviour of the industry and the market for uncut diamonds.
The economic history is used in the development of an economic analysis, involving the adaptation and application of economic theories and the statistical analysis of data.

This project is a theoretical and empirical investigation of the short run inter-relationships between the exchange rate and inflation-unemployment tradeoffs.
It synthesizes models of wage-price determination, with models of exchange rate determination.
The project models the interdependencies between the exchange rate and inflation in the short-run, addresses the question of the design of stabilization policies to minimize the labour market distortions associated with the business cycle, and considers the effects of domestic and international developments on inflation-unemployment tradeoffs, especially those transmitted through the exchange rate.
The theoretical analysis is conducted using a short run stochastic Mundell-Fleming model of a small open economy that produces tradable and non-tradable goods, and which faces a number of transitory domestic and foreign, demand side and supply side disturbances.
The empirical and non-tradable goods, and which faces a number of transitory domestic and foreign, demand side and supply side disturbances.
The empirical analysis for the UK uses two types of models: statistical and structural.
The investigators estimate structural models of the wage-price spiral, as well as vector autoregressions.

This project investigates causes and consequences of major macroeconomic problems--in particular, unemployment, stagnation, inflation, and balance of payments difficulties--in terms of microeconomic imperfections in the labour and product markets.
The microeconomic imperfections which are given special attention are imperfect information (eg firms' inability to monitor accurately the productivities of their employees), imperfect competition (eg collective bargaining), and various transactions costs (eg the costs of hiring, training, and firing employees).
In many sectors of modern industrial economies, high degrees of concentration in product markets co-exist with unionised labour markets.
The project aims to examine the implications of this state of affairs for macroeconomic activity.
It also explores how imperfections in the product markets ‘spill over’ into the labour markets and vice versa.
The project places emphasis on carefully constructed theoretical models which are intended to show how different market imperfections can lead to observationally distinguishable hypotheses concerning macroeconomic activity.
These models are then to be used as the basis of empirical investigations into labour and product market problems.

Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are afflicted by chronic problems of macro-economic instability and microeconomic imbalances.
The evidence of pervasive disequilibria in centrally planned economies has challenged traditional theories and models and generated interest in two alternative analytical approaches.
The first of these uses econometrically estimated macroeconomic and sectoral disequilibrium models.
The second employs models derived from J Kornai's theories of the shortage economy.
It focuses on non-price causes of shortage reproduction in the socialist economy.
The project has the objective of applying disequilibrium and shortage models in the analysis of the contemporary East European and Soviet economies.
Dr Wojciech Charemza, a Senior Research Fellow at CREES, is working full-time on the development of disequilibrium econometric models of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Dr Christopher Davis, a Lecturer at CREES and the Project Director, is working part-time on the topic of shortage modelling of high and low priority sectors in the Soviet economy.
The two scholars also are organising and co-editing a book in this area.

There has been a tendency to accept uncritically that all policies which help small firms are to be recommended since it is the small firm sector which in future will create new jobs and new wealth.
This research challenges the assumption of net creation of new jobs with the hypothesis that local authority aid may in fact serve to displace existing jobs, even leading to a net decrease in employment opportunities.
Most new firms duplicate existing production functions and orientate towards existing markets.
The rate of new firm formation and new firm growth will thus be influenced by the level of both final and intermediate demand in the local economy.
This relationship may be likened to a crowded platform.
It can be proposed that the ‘market room’(on the platform) for newcomers who have not generated completely new demand markets, is provided by their capture of markets from local firms on the platform.
Local authorities have recently intervened in the small firm sector in an attempt to stimulate growth of employment opportunities and the local economy.
However, even the most well-meaning attempts to induce and promote local enterprise may sometimes result in little in terms of quantifiable gains to the community at large.
For instance, broad policies for assisting new enterprise may simply result in some businesses being thrust up onto the crowded platform at the expense of others pushed off it.
The majority of data collection will be undertaken by interview.
The sample will consist of new manufacturing forms (A) in receipt of local authority assistance and a control group of matched non-assisted firms.
Interviews will ascertain, for both groups of firms, their clients (B) and will then trace back through the clients the former suppliers (C).
Detailed investigation of businesses in categories A & C in both sample and control groups will enable analysis of their economic performance.
Should the crowded platform hypothesis hold, firms from Category C should prove to be less prosperous than those in A. Similarly, companies in the sample of assisted firms should be performing better than their non-assisted counterparts.

Bus ‘deregulation’ means the introduction of competition in the provision of local bus services brought about by the Transport Act 1985.
Following this Act, bus operators are free to provide any services they wish, subject only to giving six weeks' notice, and to meeting the same safety standards as previously.
They are subject to the general legislation prohibiting anti-competitive and restrictive practices unless these are judged to be in the public interest.
In order to promote fair competition, the former large public sector bus operators have been reconstituted as free-standing companies, and in some cases broken up.
Local authorities still have the power to subsidise socially necessary bus services which are not provided commercially, but they must select the operators of subsidised services by means of competitive tenders.
This research aims to interpret and evaluate some of the developments following dereglation using micro-econoic theories of imperfect competition.
The project is concerned with the question of how competition works to determine what bus services are provided at what fares, and how the outcomes in the new regime compare both with theoretical optima and with what public authorities might choose.
Like the markets for many other services, the market for bus services cannot be perfectly competitive, which is why outcomes may not be economically efficient, and why theories of imperfect competition are needed to interpret what happens.
The project will consider in detail of number of commercial services.
As far as possible it will not collect original data, but make use of data already collected either by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory, which is monitoring deregulation comprehensively, or by local authorities.

This project is part of a larger programme of work supported by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (through grants from the Ford and Sloan Foundations) and the Houblon Norman Fund as well as the ESRC.
The aim of this research is to investigate the role of money income targets for a small open economy such as the UK, and their relationship with policies designed to avoid fluctuations in the exchange rate of the magnitude we have seen in the last few years.
The project will use a variant of the National Institute model to design policy rules involving the active use of tax rates, interest rates and foreign exchange intervention with the aim of keeping money national income on a steady path, while at the same time ensuring adequate investment takes place and stabilising the exchange rate.
The sensitivity of these results to the way in which expectations could be formed will be investigated.
The version of the National Institute model used has been modified, with earlier ESRC support so as to provide an extended modelling of the major financial linkages in the economy.
This allows expectational effects to be incorporated in the consumption, investment and capital flow equations, providing an indication of the importance of such effects in the regulation of the economy, and allowing them to be taken into account in policy design.

The aim of this research is to study aspects of structural change in advanced industrial economies since 1973.
This period has seen a sharp fall in the average rate of growth as compared to the earlier post-war experience.
Together with the emerging pattern of industrial development in a number of Third World countries, this exerted strong pressures towards structural change in most advanced industrial economies.
The project examines in some detail the ways in which Western economies (the member countries of the European Communities, the US and Japan) have responded to this environment.
Two exercises in particular are carried out: One develops an econometric model in which the differential structural change pattern in the major OECD economies is shown to be interdependent.
It is demonstrated by means of both cross-section and time series studies on a disaggregated level that the evolution of relative supply-side characteristics (productivity growth, renewal of the capital stock, product composition, etc) of the different national industries affects their respective market shares in domestic and international markets and thus their growth performance.
The other exercise involves a detailed examination of industrial statistics since 1973 in order to detect the various stages and compare the strength by which structural adjustment processes have taken place in the different economies.
Their significance for the longer-term structure of industrial specialisation and the prospects for competitive success or failure in particular industrial areas of the different national economies is then evaluated.

The object of this research is to produce a comprehensive study of the life and work of Harold Hotelling (1895-1973).
Hotelling was a leading mathematical economist and statistician and, although he published very few papers in economic theory, his contributions to spatial economics, the economics of exhaustible resources, demand theory, utility theory, the analysis of the incidence of taxation, and welfare economics each assumed the stature of classics in his own lifetime.
To date there has been no systematic study of Hotelling's life and work; this is a major omission in the study of the history of economics, since Hotelling was responsible for pioneering major developments in the mathematical methods of theoretical economics as well as furthering our understanding of specific questions in economics.

Several policies have been introduced into the public sector in recent years whose chief purpose is to obtain better ‘value for money’.
The impact of these policies towards this goal depends critically on how they are implemented.
The research looks at the implementation of two such policies whose basis has an economic rationale: namely, competitive tendering, and the financial-cum-economic appraisal of capital schemes.
Their implementation is studied in the context of the National Health Service, but the analysis is not NHS specific, nor need the conclusions be.
The introduction of competitive tendering is intended to test the efficiency of in house services, and to reduce expenditure.
Several contracts put out to tender are reviewed for: the degree of competition in house tender faced, and the outcome in respect of total expenditure, the sources of cost savings, and redundancies.
Economic analysis is used to give insights into these questions.
The Treasury has provided guidance to public sector departments on the appraisal of capital schemes.
Guidance was first published in 1973, and it has been periodically revised in the light of experience gained.
The appraisal of capital schemes is reviewed according to the guidance published in 1982.
The general impression has been that major capital schemes not requiring Treasury approval have been poorly appraised.
The research examines this conclusion since it is at variance with rational economic planning.

The rules of wage bargaining institutions are almost certainly of importance in determining the quality of the agreement that are reached, as well as the costs (in terms of money, time and effort) of arriving at those agreements.
The systematic study of this dependence has recently been made feasible by the development of the theory of sequential games.
This theory can be used to predict the sequence of offers before arbitration was involved and in the frequency with which arbitration was used.
The verbatim records have survived almost intact and enable the sequence of offers and counteroffers that should be made by bargainers behaving optimally according to the rules.
The research will use this theory as the basis of a comparative study of five late Victorian bargaining units: the coal-mining conciliation boards.
The records of these boards show great variety in the length of time taken to reach agreements, the disparity in offers and counteroffers and the flow of information to be traced in detail.
The intention is to use the constitutions of the boards to construct game-forms.
Equipped with appropriate payoff structures, these will be used to isolate the separate influences of constitutions, arbitrators and negotiators on the outcomes.

In May 1985, over 2,000 workers were made redundant at the Michelin Tyre factory at Stoke-on-Trent.
The work experiences of a sample of these workers over their first twelve months after redundancy have already been the subject of extensive research under ESRC project F/00/23/2257.
It was clear from the work done then that, even after a full year, major changes in unemployment, self-employment, and employment taken up and ended within the group, were still occurring at a high rate.
The aim of the current research is to up-date this longitudinal work history data over the subsequent twelve month period up to June 1987.
The data obtained will be an important means by which labour market adjustments following large-scale disturbances may be better understood.

In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the expenditures by district councils in helping firms to create local employment.
The government, through its regional policy, also provides assistance to companies creating jobs in depressed areas.
There is now considerable overlap between what district councils are doing and what regional policy is attempting to achieve.
In some ways what the district councils do tends to reinforce the efforts of regional policy.
In other ways the activities of the councils tend to conflict with regional policy and weaken its effects.
The research aims to obtain detailed evidence of the various ways in which assistance given to firms by district councils conflicts with, or alternatively helps regional policy to bring jobs to the depressed areas.
The research looks at district councils across the whole of England and Wales.
It also concentrates on a small number of councils as detailed case studies.
The study is designed to be pilot study of this important issue.

This research is concerned with the economic theory of bank lending to industry.
It is intended to fill a gap in the theory of corporate finance.
In the UK and many other countries, banks are the major source of external funds for industry.
Most research on corporate finance comes from the USA and largely ignores banks which play a much less significant role there than elsewhere.
The effects of interest rates and the tax rate on investment incentives have been extensively studied.
But negotiating a bank loan involves much more than agreeing an interest rate.
Banks assess the performance and prospects of firms before lending.
If a loan is agreed, the bank monitors the firm's subsequent performance.
The terms of the loan specify a repayment schedule, and often restrict the firm in other ways, but the loan may be renegotiated subsequently.
If the firm gets into difficulty, its bankers become intimately involved in restructuring or liquidating the firm.
This project aims to develop models which take these factors into account, and so to understand how they affect investment decisions.
This work will provide some of the theoretical foundations for an empirical project on the provision of funds for industry in France, Germany, Japan, UK and USA, run through the Centre for Economic Policy Research by Margaret Bray, Jeremy Edwards and Colin Mayer.

The rise since 1900 in the proportion of elderly people in Britain, the reduction in the labour force participation of this elderly population, and the heavy reliance of retired people on state pensions and other benefits, together have focused attention on the current economic problems of an ageing population.
The research aims to investigate these past trends by analysing data on the employment, income, savings, welfare transfers and household circumstances of the elderly population in Britain since 1900.
It will use these data to calculate the share of GDP and government expenditure devoted to the elderly, and to examine how and why this has altered over time.
It will also estimate the impact of government policies on the savings behaviour and employment patterns of the elderly.
In addition, the research will assess the way in which the economic expectations of elderly people have changed over the twentieth century.
The research will make use of both long-run time series data and more recent cross-section data derived from the Family Expenditure Survey and the General Household Survey.

Although there has been much research on the determination of asset prices, there has been little research on what determines the volume of turnover in asset markets.
Yet a sizeable turnover is required for a successful market: given the concern with the structure of the London capital market, and increasing international competition between markets, analysis of what determines turnover has an immediate relevance.
The research is a complementary and interrelated series of studies on asset price/turnover relationships.
This includes a cross-country, time series study of the determinants of turnover in major world-wide Stock Exchanges, and a study of the day-to-day relationships between turnover and price changes in the London Stock Exchange and foreign exchange markets.
The central hypothesis in this latter case is that ‘news’ drives markets, so that asset price variability and transaction volume should be positively correlated.
Certain anomalies have appeared, however, eg a ‘week-end’ effect on stock prices, which is being tested.
Another anomaly is that, whereas spot exchange rates follow a ‘random walk’, the forward exchange rate is usually signalling some change.
A last exercise involves studying the interrelationships between exchange rates and interest rates to explore this latter phenomenon.

By common consent, the European Monetary System (EMS) has attained a measure of success in stabilising the exchange rates of its members.
At the same time it has provided a setting for counter-inflation policy during a period when the emphasis of policy shifted, world-wide, towards the control of inflation.
The project seeks to clarify how the EMS has provided a framework for counter-inflationary policy by investigating the ways in which wages and prices are formed in the different economies.
Because of the emphasis accorded to the influence of Germany in enforcing counter-inflationary discipline, the project seeks to look specifically at how the ‘German Standard’ has been imported into other EMS member economies.
There are several ways in which this might occur.
First, because of membership of the EMS, wage-bargainers and price-setters in other countries may take particular notice of the DM exchange rate and inflationary trends (if any) in the Federal Republic; second, over a period of time, wage and price responses in other countries might evolve towards the German norm; third, it may simply be that in a period when for fundamental social and political reasons the control of inflation came to assume dominance in policy-making, policy-makers found it a useful discipline to conduct their fiscal and monetary affairs in such a way as to stabilise the exchange rate against the DM.
Each of these possible routes deserves investigation.

Technological innovation is recognised to be an important determinant of industrial competitiveness.
However the existing knowledge of how and why technological innovation occurs is still limited.
In particular, policy makers wanting to stimulate technological innovation in given industrial areas lack both solid evidence about past trends in technology and effective ways of monitoring the development of new technologies.
The research aims to gather enough empirical information about the development of a number of technologies to be able to apply quantitative techniques to identify elementary trends in the evolution of technologies (for example the substitution of one technology by another one, processes of specialization, the appearance of completely new technologies etc).
The type of information to be acquired about each technology consists of specifications of the technology (eg the speed or payload of a commercial aircraft, the memory size of a computer) and of information about the economic environment in which the technology has been adopted.
The data thus collected will be used to identify trends in the technologies studied.
The influence of technological change on industrial competitiveness will be analysed by relating trends in technology to changes in the economic environment in which they take place.
Several multivariate analysis techniques will be used to elaborate the data for these purposes.
The information gathered is almost exclusively about technological characteristics.
However, the analysis is expected to give important indications about the nature of the selection environment in which the technology develops.

The initial impact of monetary policy depends upon the behaviour of individuals and institutions in financial markets, including the foreign exchange market.
The research aims to provide econometric evidence on the importance of expectations and unanticipated or ‘surprise’ events on the holding of financial assets.
In particular, it is recognised that agents may use some assets as a buffer-stock against unforeseen changes in net receipts.
Considerable effort will be directed towards investigating alternative ways in which agents in financial markets form their expectations.
At a later stage in the project, the investigators shall consider the impact of changes in financial assets on ‘real’ variables such as consumers' expenditure.
Time series data are to be used and the hypotheses will be tested for other countries as well as the UK.
Particular emphasis will be placed on the development of appropriate estimation techniques for equations incorporating future expectations variables.

This research aims to appraise the effectiveness of different kinds of public sector financial assistance provided to industry.
Effectiveness is defined primarily in terms of employment (crudely speaking the ‘cost per job’).
The intention is to identify the role that both the type of assistance (in terms of its purpose and form) and the characteristics of the recipient establishment (in terms of its size, capital-intensity, etc) play in determining the cost-effectiveness of financial assistance.
The area chosen to carry out this examination is a sub-region of the North-East of England, and the study period is 1974-84.
This provides the opportunity to compare the effectiveness of the two major instruments of regional policy (Regional Development Grant and Regional Selective Assistance) with the financial assistance policies of the local authorities and many other agencies.
To estimate the effects of these assistance measures, several complementary approaches are to be adopted.
One approach will involve examining the effects of different forms of assistance within a multi-period model of the firm.
The research has access to data on assistance payments, employment and financial characteristics, and this will be used to estimate the effects of assistance at the establishment level using regression techniques.

In recent times, farm incomes in disadvantaged rural areas such as upland N E Scotland have only been maintained by a reduction in farm numbers, an increase in farm size and a fall in farm employment.
Effective prescriptions for sustaining rural communities through improvements in rural incomes and employment require an understanding of the composition and functioning of the rural economy.
In particular it is necessary to understand the relative economic importance of the industries concerned and how they trade with one another, the local population and other parts of the country and the world.
The project involves the estimation of an economic input-output model of Grampian Region's rural area, paying particular attention to agriculture and its related industries.
This model will be used to evaluate alternative policies for encouraging economic development in rural Grampian and similar rural areas.
The model will be constructed from a combination of data sources to adjust and augment the Scottish Input-Output Table for 1979.
These will include Regional employment statistics, a survey of Grampian's rural industries and analysis of local farm accounts.
Alternative policy measures for assisting agriculture and other industries will be assessed in terms of their impact on Regional employment, incomes and output.

This project is based on three premises: that more young economists, bound for industry, particularly consultancy, the civil service and the city, should have at least been apprenticed in research--hence, in part, the use of occasional research assistants rather than experienced professionals; that applied economists should pay more attention to the views of non economists, and, in particular of practitioners in the fields they study, hence the emphasis on the flexibility required if we are to look at problems differently, or use different types of evidence; and that more of us should build our models self consciously, with an eye to analytical convenience and ease of interpretation, considerations which would be less important were economics less inexact, since it might then make sense to seek the correct model, however difficult to analyse and understand.
The aim is to produce more economists who can handle practical affairs seriously; more generalists--aware in a rough way of what non economists think--by making it easier to concentrate on particular problems, so that their views may more easily be sought and comprehended; and more theorists who plan their work in an economic manner.

The motivation for this research derives from the pressing need to assess the reliability of econometric models for cross-section data.
The potentially large amount of information now available in cross-section surveys has led to a recent explosion in applied economic studies using these data sources.
However, although many policy prescriptions are based on models estimated using such data, for example in taxation and labour supply, the properties of estimators for these models rely heavily on strong and usually untested stochastic assumptions.
This importance of the stochastic specification plays a critical role in cross-section models in particular wherever the data under study suffer from censoring, truncation or grouping.
In such common situations, the properties of the estimators depend crucially, for example, on the whole shape of the assumed distribution of unobservables.
Despite the importance of these assumptions in econometric models for cross-section data, it is only recently that simple tests for their reliability have been developed.
Furthermore, there has been little systematic application of these tests to cross-section models or data sets commonly used in economics and no controlled experiments or finite sample analyses to assess their performance on such data.
It is this gap that the research intends to fill.

There is a clear need to investigate whether the assumptions upon which econometric models are based are consistent with empirical data.
The primary purpose of this project is to extend existing results pertaining to tests of the adequacy of such models.
New procedures will be developed and evidence on the behaviour of those already available will be provided, along with details of any modifications that seem helpful.
Tests will be derived by checking whether generalisations of a model under scrutiny lead to significant gains.
Methods involving the comparison of competing models will also be considered.
Emphasis will be placed upon ease of implementation, reliability, and the performance of statistical techniques for sample sizes similar to those commonly available in practice.

The sharp increase in unemployment in recent years has drawn attention to the question of how labour markets work.
This question is of particular interest in a region like Northern Ireland, where unemployment is now over 20%.
For a long time, however, Northern Ireland has had a much higher unemployment rate than the UK as a whole and has represented the extreme of regional disparity.
The purpose of this study is two-fold.
The first step is to produce a set of descriptive statistics of such variables as employment, unemployment, output, productivity and labour costs for Northern Ireland, at as detailed a level as the data permit.
Comparisons with other regions of the UK and with the Republic of Ireland are included.
Having clarified the relevant facts to be accounted for, the second step is to formulate and test models of the Northern Ireland labour market.
One model assumes that wages paid in Northern Ireland are the same as those paid in Great Britain; there are no wage rate data for the region.
The other exploits the existence of regional earnings data and treats them as being influenced by local labour market conditions.
An analysis of the results should shed light on the workings of the Northern Ireland labour market.

Economic modelling
This programme develops and refines a detailed model of the Scottish economy constructed and made operational under a previous ESRC programme award.
The aims are to contribute to the theoretical and empirical understanding of how the Scottish economy works, to make projections of Scottish economy statistics for up to five years ahead, and to analyse the effects of government policies.
(1)
Updating of the data base and associated software development
There are two principal components: first, to revise the input-output data based on Scottish tables for 1979, including new absorption, make and final demand allocation matrices; secondly to update the existing series on the Institute's modelling databank (eg family expenditure survey information and series on output, employment and earnings).
(2)
Investment and factor demand
The project will develop a framework for the estimation of investment which will permit the examination of substitution possibilities between capital and labour (this implies simultaneous estimation of labour and capital goods demand).
The Census of Production will be used to estimate a system of factor demands using a dual-cost function approach.
(3)
Consumption
In the present model, consumers' expenditures are allocated using a linear expenditure system.
This project develops potentially superior demand systems with a view to incorporating them in the model.
The modelling of savings (taking into account personal taxation, income transfers and superannuation) is also to be undertaken.
With regard to the demand system, UK price data will be refined to reflect known differences in the structure of relative prices between Scotland and the UK.
(4)
Labour supply
This project will involve modelling population, participation/activity rates and labour migration.
With regard to activity rates, there are two main issues to examine.
First, it will be necessary to understand the reasons for the relatively higher female participation in the Scottish labour market, possibly due to demographic, industrial and price effects.
Secondly, the role of labour supply in explaining regional differentials in unemployment will have to be examined.
(5)
Interregional trade
The programme will collect primary data on trade flows between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom by a survey of the wholesale and distribution sector.
Direct approaches will also be made to firms operating in Scotland, in about two hundred interviews covering fifty industrial and services sectors.

The amount of tax revenue raised by VAT depends on
(i)
the amount of value added in each product
(ii)
the amount of each product bought by consumers, and
(iii)
the rate of VAT applied to each product.
Understanding the structure of VAT yields is important in providing the Chancellor with accurate forecasts of the revenue this tax will produce, and studying the impact of the tax on different sectors of the economy.
HM Customs and Excise's current method of forecasting the yield is to establish a relationship between aggregate yield and aggregate consumer expenditure, and project this forward given estimates of future consumer expenditure from the Treasury model.
The aim of this research project is to improve this method by:
(a)
establishing the relationship between aggregate VAT yields and consumer expenditure on particular commodity groups;
(b)
exploring the relationship between aggregate expenditure and expenditure on these particular groups.
Taken together these two relationships will improve on the current single relationship by allowing for shifts in consumer spending between commodities with different amounts of value added.
Part
(a)
will apply statistical methods to aggregate time-series data on VAT revenue and expenditures on commodity groups, while
(b)
will analyse both aggregate time-series and cross data on consumer expenditure.

The Japanese version of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is referred to as the Integrated Network System (INS).
This system takes advantage of interrelated new technologies in areas such as Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), computers, digital switching, fibre optics, and opto-electronics in order to integrate within one system the delivery of voice, data, image, and text services.
The Integrated Network System is being developed under the direction of Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (NTT), since April 1985 a privatised entity.
In this endeavour, NTT, which has four important R & D laboratories but which does not itself manufacture telecommunications equipment, is assisted by a number of Japanese electronics companies.
The present study will be divided up into two main parts.
The first will examine the current state of development of INS.
The second part, which will comprise the bulk of the study, will examine the way in which several key telecommunications technologies have been developed.
Of particular interest in this connection is the way in which complex technologies have been developed in co-operation with NTT on the one hand and competing Japanese electronics companies on the other.
Furthermore, if resources permit, it might be possible to also examine one of the telecommunications-related projects organised by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which will contribute to the development of the broader digital network system.

As members of the EEC, Britain and France have common tariff policies, but they retain quite distinct policies regarding non-tariff barriers.
In some cases, we have openly-admitted quotas etc applying to third countries, eg on textiles, where the UK and France have different regimes.
In other cases, we have regulations that are ostensibly to do with health or technical standards and can therefore be applied to goods coming from the rest of the EEC as well.
The UK and France have always accused each other of malpractice, the UK claiming that the French are the most protectionist country in Europe; the French say that they are simply more open about it, and that the UK is just as bad.
This project unites a joint team of British and French economists and lawyers from the Universities of Sussex and Grenoble to review the existing evidence in a dispassionate collaborative manner to try to develop a common view and to carry out a limited number of new investigations in areas of particular sensitivity.
One of the aims is to look at the links between commercial and industrial policy in order to see if one can devise any common criteria to distinguish legitimate goals of industrial policy from capricious protectionism.

Indirect taxation in the form of VAT is a major source of UK tax revenue, accounting for about half of the take from commodity taxation and about 15% of total tax revenue.
Since its introduction, the structure of VAT has gone through some significant changes and is again the focus of debate following pressures for tax harmonisation within the EEC.
Generally there has been little quantitative analysis of precisely how individual households adjust their expenditure behaviour in response to VAT changes and the aim of this project is to fill this gap.
To study these effects a detailed and reliable knowledge of all the relevant inter-relationships between commodity expenditures, household characteristics and post tax prices must be found.
For this purpose the investigators are using the UK Family Expenditure Survey pooled over the years 1970 to 1985 set up jointly with the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
This is in principle an ideal source and in the investigators' initial work has already displayed important and robust relationships between post tax prices, commodity expenditures and other household characteristics.
This is not to say that there do not exist important statistical problems which need to be overcome and a major part of this project is directed towards these more econometric issues.
The outcome of this project will be a computer simulation routine usable on standard microcomputers designed to assess the response of consumers' expenditure and VAT revenue to changes in VAT rates.

There have been many, well publicised, attempts to turn domestic waste into fuel pellets.
When some of these were examined, they were found to be less than successful; in some cases because of poor engineering practice but generally because of inadequate evaluation of the economic factors involved.
It costs about 20 to make a tonne of waste derived fuel pellets and these have about half the calorific value of coal.
These pellets should not be used extensively in the domestic market because of the possibility of their producing toxic gases when incompletely burnt.
Their use in the industrial market will, in the future, be in competition with open cast coal which can be less than 50 per tonne.
If profit is required from the manufacture of Waste Derived Fuel (WDF), there remains little premium to compensate the customer for the problems of changing from coal (greater bulk; more ash; more boiler maintenance).
Shop waste is mostly paper (with some plastic) and the possibility arises of collecting this waste and converting it to fuel pellets which have a calorific value of about two thirds that of coal.
The cost of manufacturing pellets from this commercial waste would be about 20 per tonne and the fuel produced should be competitive with coal.
This investigation was into the feasibility of building a plant to make 10,000 tonnes of pellets a year from waste collected from the larger Swansea shops.
Preliminary investigations showed the required quantity of feedstock to be available.
One problem was immediately clear: nearly all the large shops have contracts with waste paper merchants or waste disposal companies and for some years, at least, it would be necessary to collect the waste from the contractors, not the shops.
Currently there is a glut of waste paper and much recyclable paper is being landfilled (at a cost of at least 4 per tonne).
The general findings of the feasibility study were that a WDF plant could be just profitable, but that at present, neither the quality nor quantity of the feedstock, at an acceptable price, is assured.
Work is proceeding on the economic feasibility of making a fuel pellet from commercial waste and anthracite dust.
This fuel is more expensive to manufacture but could compete in the domestic market where there is a shortage of anthracite.
An economic model has been built to determine the sensitivity of this project to the variation of input parameters and work is proceeding on the commercial possibilities of a plant in the South Wales area.

Privatisation of public enterprises, hiving-off of sections of a government department with potential commercial viability, creation of internal trading funds, and contracting-out are now parts of political party programmes in many countries.
In so far as such doctrines owe anything to economic theory, it is to that body of theorising now encompassed within the term ‘public choice theory’, and particularly to economic models of bureaucracy.
For example, theory shows that financing a service by an annually-negotiated budget will result in a higher level of provision of the service than would be socially optimal, and higher than would be provided by financing through charges to the user.
Also, theory shows that an organisation which cannot ‘go bankrupt’ is liable to contain more ‘slack’than one which can.
This project tests a number of these theoretical predictions by investigating some actual examples of changes of organisational status and ownership (moves within and from ‘public’ towards ‘private’, or the reverse) in Britain over, say, the last twenty years, to see whether the expected effects show up.
These include not only full privatisations, but also change to ‘trading-fund rules’ within a government department, to public corporation status, to government-owned company, and so on.
Possible examples include the Post Office, British Telecom, Rolls Royce, the Royal Ordnance Factories, British Airways and British Aerospace, Jaguar Cars, Royal Mint and Her Majesty's Stationery Office, Thomas Cook, and the National Freight Corporation.

Planning and land policy
The system of land use planning in Britain, and its implementation, is designed to produce specific results in land use patterns and benefits for the environment.
Producing these benefits has costs, however, and because there may be unintentional impacts on relative prices, there may be consequences elsewhere in the economy.
The direct costs of the system fall into three categories: the costs of operating the system; these are met by government and developers (and households).
There are also costs of compliance, for example, the costs of delays or of more expensive design or construction.
Finally, there may be costs incurred by would-be developers who attempt to produce capital gains by getting planning permission.
Apart from identifying benefits and measuring direct costs generated by the system, the research aims to discover the effects of planning controls on land values, affecting relative prices, output, and employment elsewhere in the economy.
The planning system has been in existence in roughly its present form since 1947 but no one has before attempted to measure how much the system costs.
This research aims to do that and, whilst it will not ‘value’ the benefits, these will be itemised and related to those costs and perhaps cheaper ways of producing similar benefits found.
In addition, methods for measuring the effects of the planning system on land values will be tested and, if successful, the total effect on land prices in two sample towns will be estimated.
It is a pilot project in that, if the method produces sound estimates of the effect of planning controls on land values, further research could establish the total effect for the whole country and estimate the consequences of that for the economy.

Since the early eighties, developing countries have faced debt crises and rescheduling on an unprecedented scale.
This project will attempt to document how debt crises occurred and how they were handled in specific countries since the early eighties.
The country experiences) to be studied in depth, by their own nationals who are senior civil servants or senior academics, are Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Chile.
The African experience will also be examined, emphasizing similarities and differences with Latin America.
The case studies will be written within a previously defined framework, which will include the definition of common measures of debt bargain and adjustment, provide an analytical context including relevant elements in economic and political science theory as well as suggest a hypothesis to be tested in relation to the differences in the terms obtained by different countries.
The differences and similarities to be explained will include not only the value of the debt relief, but also the new credit flows obtained and the economic adjustment required, as part of the ‘debt bargains’.
In a final section, policy proposals will be made to improve the debt rescheduling process and minimize the negative effect of debt crises.
This project is being jointly funded by ESRC (UK) and IDRC (Canada), and will include both British) based and Latin) American based researchers.

The centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe have experienced a serious deterioration in economic performance in the 1970s: growth slowdown and occasional decline, external imbalance, growing foreign indebtedness, rising open and repressed inflation, shortages, informal markets, etc.
In Poland, these phenomena have been quantitatively most important; they precipitated the political and economic crisis of 1980-81.
This project investigates the conjecture that the Polish crisis is ‘systemic’, ie deeply rooted in the economic and political processes of Polish society as a socialist system.
Macroeconomic inefficiency and macroeconomic imbalances built into the system, and the centralisation of political power, have combined with adverse international factors (the oil crisis; world trade stagnation, changes in terms of trade, rising interest rates, international inflation, rising cost of Western technology transfer, etc) to produce a crisis of exceptional depth and duration.
The project makes extensive use of quantitative methods and also analyses institutional and organisational changes.
The specific features of Poland are isolated in order to assess the prospects of similar trends in other socialist countries.
The findings of this project should contribute to the theory of comparative economic systems and have important practical implications for East-West trade prospects and Western lending policy.

The French and British governments are following exactly the opposite policies on production in the public sector; the French have nationalised an additional 12% of industrial output while the British have begun to sell public assets to the private sector and to plan a vigorous programme of privatisation over the next few years.
Each side draws upon economic arguments to justify their actions but the conceptual framework is weak and there is little hard empirical evidence.
This period of institutional change in these broadly comparable economies provides an unusual opportunity to find out how nationalisation or privatisation actually affects enterprise behaviour and the fulfilment of industrial policy goals.
The two research teams in this Franco-British project, one based in London and the other in Paris, propose to exploit this opportunity.
The primary aims are to establish an analytical framework in which the effects of ownership changes on corporate behaviour and performance can be modelled; to compare what has actually happened to the organisation of nationalised and denationalised firms in France and Britain: and to devise appropriate tools and data sets for later empirical and econometric investigation.
In addition to analytical work and reading, research will use interviews within enterprises to study how ownership arrangement affects managerial autonomy, motivation and incentives, decision-making structures and R and D.
Interviews with civil servants will also be used to investigate the consequences for welfare issues and the effectiveness of government policy.

Existing macroeconomic models are generally deficient in both their treatment of the supply behaviour of the economy and of expectations formation.
The research is directed towards the specification and estimation of a small annual macroeconomic model of the United Kingdom in the post-war period aimed at rectifying these shortcomings.
The employment, output and pricing decisions of firms will be derived within a consistent framework.
Expectations will be identified explicitly, making it easier to simulate alternative policies under a variety of assumptions about the way expectations are formed, and the way investigations are formed, and the investigation of the robustness of different policies.
There are two production sectors in the model, manufacturing and non-manufacturing, as well as North Sea oil production.

The study is concerned with the way in which decisions are made with regard to public spending.
What approaches have been adopted to the appraisal of spending in France and the United Kingdom?
How far have they been influenced by the recent developments in the economic analysis?
This analysis has recognised the wider context within which expenditure decisions have to be made and the need to take account of the responses of households and firms.
The study examines the application of this analysis in the two countries.
It is concerned with both theoretical and applied aspects, the latter emphasising the use of sample survey data in policy analysis.
The project includes two case studies.
The first deals with land use decisions and environmental issues, as they have been handled in Britain and France.
The second study examines income maintenance for families, where there are significant differences in policy in the two countries.

The economies of both Britain and France are currently undergoing major changes, and in both countries, this requires a great deal of flexibility in their respective labour forces.
Such flexibility can take many forms including reductions of manpower, changes in job descriptions, and retraining and redeployment within the firm.
It has been observed, for example, that British firms find it easier to persuade workers to accept redundancies but harder to obtain flexibility of working practices and job demarcations than do their French counterparts.
The project investigates this more fully, and asks why British and French firms should rely on different types of adjustment, and how far this is caused by differences between the two countries in the organisation of vocational training, and that of skilled work, in collective bargaining arrangements, and in labour market organisation.
It appears that industrial skills in Britain are more often transferable between employers, partly because of the apprenticeship system, whereas in France, they are less so because of greater use by employers of in-house training and up-grading.
The project is being carried out in collaboration with Drs F Eyraud and J J Silvestre of the Laboratoire d'Economie et de Sociologie du Travail, in Aix-en-Provence.

Over the last ten years, there has been an increasing interplay between formal economic/econometric work on macroeconomics and the formulation of practical economic policy.
Interest in money supply control on the part of governments has brought to the fore the notion that ‘rational’ expectations on part of the private economy may limit the efficacy of policy and in some cases thwart it.
One way in which, for example, financial institutions have reacted is to innovate new assets which can evade control by monetary authorities.
But there is much work to be done with the econometric modelling of rational expectations and of innovative behaviour in financial markets before their policy implications can be fully understood.
It is intended to formulate and test models of the British economy, incorporating rational expectations as well as alternative expectations schemes in models which will also specify innovation and choice at the micro level and integrate micro-economic behaviour with macroeconomic variables.
The work will involve developing appropriate econometric methodology for estimating, testing and simulating these models.

Throughout its post-war history Yugoslavia has exhibited a strong tendency to serious Balance of Payments deficit.
With the cumulative debt arising from this amounting to nearly 20 billion dollars by 1982, the Yugoslavs found themselves in danger of default on debt service.
A rescue operation was mounted in 1963, but the Balance of Payments situation remains fundamentally unsatisfactory.
The technical literature suggests that structural factors may have been more important than price factors in explaining the persistent deficit.
The key to an understanding of the structural factors may lie in the whole development strategy pursued in Yugoslavia since the war.
But the increasing recognition of the importance of these factors since the mid-60s has not produced more positive results, and this requires analysis.
The research aims to answer two crucial questions.
First, what does the Yugoslav experience tell us about the strengths and weaknesses of the ‘import-led growth’ strategy?
Secondly, in a world containing an increasingly large number of medium-developed countries with critical foreign debt problem, what should be the policies of western governments and financial institutions towards the extension of further credit?

The relative share of the public sector (central and local government plus the public corporations) in total expenditure has increased in all of the industrialised economies this century.
It has aroused concern because of the resulting increase in the burden of taxation and reduction in individual choice.
The research aims first to identify the factors responsible for the growth of the various elements of public expenditure, so that some idea can be obtained as to their future development; and secondly to discover to what extent these developments have represented, and will represent, claims on real resources, contributions to real output, or simply an increasing burden of taxation.
The data employed are the published national accounts of the UK, supplemented by the national accounts statistics of the other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and by the data used in studies of local government expenditure in the US.
The possibilities for recasting the UK accounts are being examined, with the intention of making them reflect the real resource use, or output contribution, of the public sector, rather than simply its share of expenditure.
The project includes investigatory interviews with those connected with public expenditure decisions and data in the Treasury, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, the Central Statistical Office, the Federal Reserve, the EEC and the OECD.

The main aim of this project is to provide better models for assessing a country's creditworthiness and foreign debt-servicing problems than those currently available.
Weaknesses of existing models include the following:—
(i)
only economic factors are included as determinants of debt-servicing capacity; social and political influences are ignored,
(ii)
distinction is made only between cases where countries reschedule their foreign debt and those where they do not; alternative strategies such as refinancing, restructuring, foreign exchange controls, etc, are ignored, and
(iii)
estimates of the effects of various factors in determining debt-servicing problems are unstable, changing from one sample of countries and time-periods to another.
A more satisfactory theory of what determines a country's ability to carry foreign debt should be developed allowing for interactions between economic growth, political stability and debt-servicing capacity, and distinguishing between permanent and transitory states of the relevant variables.
This empirical work is intended to remove the above weaknesses in previous work, by including political and social variables, by distinguishing several alternatives to debt-rescheduling, and by testing these models for different sets of countries and time-periods.

This is the second stage of work on the innovation problems of small high technology firms and their subsequent varying impact on regional economies.
While the earlier research concentrated on the impact of local external resources on innovation within such firms (eg labour supply industrial material linkages), the current work seeks to explore the internal impact of variable entrepreneurship on small firm innovation, and the subsequent ramification on regional economic growth.
The current work adopts a novel methodology in which 174 firms originally interviewed during the initial research in Scotland, South East England and The Bay Area of California in the USA will be re-contacted to explore factors critical to the management of innovation (eg finance, R & D), and add a time series dimension to the data compiled on innovative performance.
This new work will again reap the considerable advantage of sharp regional diversity in examining the different entrepreneurial behaviour patterns of small firm executives in the economically and politically diverse study regions.

The agrarian structure in Chile has undergone profound changes during the last twenty years.
The administration of President Frei (1964-70) initiated a land reform programme which was accelerated by the Popular Unity government of President Allende (1970-73).
Following the military coup in September 1973 which brought General Pinochet to power, the agricultural producer cooperatives were abolished and all expropriated land was either returned to the previous owners, sold in private plots to ex-cooperative members or auctioned to third parties.
Programmes of technical assistance and subsidised credit to small farmers were sharply reduced.
The research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a follow-up study of peasant households in Chile which were previously interviewed in 1968.
Such a re-survey would provide a unique source of information on the nature and extent of changes experienced by the small holding sector during the last two decades.
The feasibility study involves five separate activities
(1)
tracing the original respondents, which requires locating two hundred and twenty-five farms in nine rural communities;
(2)
collecting primary data which requires the formulation and testing of several different types of questionnaire (Farm and Property History Schedule, Household Demographic and Migration History Schedule, Household Economic History Schedule and Farm Management Schedule);
(3)
exploring the possibilities of collaboration in the follow-up study with a local institution, the Agrarian Research Group (GIA);
(4)
appraising the environment in Chile at local and national level for undertaking social science research; and
(5)
data analysis back in the UK.

The economic well-being of the UK economy depends crucially on the performance of multinational enterprises, both those based in the UK and those from abroad.
The research aims to assess the extent and ways in which such companies have restructured their activities in response to the volatile international economy of the last fifteen years.
Analyses of secondary data on aggregate trends and patterns of investment by such enterprises are supplemented by an examination of prominent job losses reported in the financial press and interviews with the management of multinationals in two industries (man-made fibres and scientific and industrial instruments).
The findings are likely to generate important implications in terms of competitiveness, regional and labour market impact and regulatory policy.

Economic modelling
The macro-economic model constructed by the Treasury is available for use by the public.
As well as being used to produce economic forecasts, the model can be used to answer questions on the impact over the whole economy of alternative economic policies.
The effect, for example, of increasing public expenditure or reducing interest rates on output, employment, inflation, the balance of payments, the money supply etc, can be investigated.
An interesting way of using the model in a policy context is to set target values for particular variables at a specified date into the future.
For example, the desired values of unemployment, inflation and monetary growth at the end of 1987 could be specified to be 2 million, 6% and 8%, or whatever combination is desired.
The use of optimal control techniques will then adjust the policy instruments available to the government — tax rates, public expenditure and so on— in order to achieve the target values.
The aim of the project — carried out at Imperial College — is to apply optimal control programs to the Treasury model and to investigate policy choices.

The study reports on the findings of a re-interview survey of employers' attitudes to the Youth Training Scheme, which was originally carried out in 1984 and repeated in 1985.
The original sample covered 297 trainees for 96 employers in the Dundee and Renfrew Districts of Scotland and the re-interview survey covers 88 of these employers who now engage 222 trainees.
The main conclusions of the survey relate to the costs and benefits of training, the extent to which additional employment is generated and the rate at which trainees leave the scheme.
In general there is evidence of positive net benefits for employers but that a large proportion of further employment which might be attributed to the scheme restricts employment of other potential employees.
The recent developments in youth training policy are reviewed and it is argued that while the Youth Training Scheme has many attributes as a basis for an integrated training system, it fails to take account of two problems.
First, the matching of demand and supply of skills in the labour market is seriously neglected.
Second, the current programme fails to recognise the urgency of providing long-term Government involvement in financing and developing a training strategy for all occupational skills.

The UK paint brush industry is an extreme example of a traditional industry facing stiff competition from imports.
Its peculiar feature is that the main raw material, pig bristle, is bought from a monopoly supplier, China, and it is imports of Chinese paint brushes that have quadrupled within the last three years.
The Chinese imports have, by and large, appeared in unusual channels of distribution, such as small general stores, Sunday markets, self-service garages, etc, which were not previously served by the UK industry.
The aim of the project is to establish, by interview and questionnaire, the main channels of imports of Chinese brushes and their mode of distribution.
It will act as a case study in how imports are facilitated by changing distribution patterns in the UK and how UK manufacturers' ability to react is hampered by an inadequate information base.
It also looks at the problems of mounting an anti- dumping action against a Communist country.

Taking Norfolk as a case study, this project investigates the contribution which local authorities make in the area of job-creation through their provision of industrial premises.
The study involves a survey covering both employers and employees in a sample of some 200 firms occupying premises either leased or sold by the public sector.
The research investigates such issues as the number and type of new jobs created on industrial estates, whether such jobs are filled by previously unemployed/or employed workers or school leavers, whether they are filled by migrants to the area and so forth.
In general, it is hoped that the study will provide some assessment of the contribution which such local authority economic development initiatives can make towards overcoming the unemployment problem in the context of the local labour market.

It is hoped to develop and refine the approach by examining specific corporate behaviour and relationships as well as to contribute to analysis in these industrial sectors for major and selected minor European and US firms.
The evolution of strategy and structure in these areas are studied with particular consideration being given to the role of technological change.
Strategic interactions between competing firms and determinants of limits to vertical integration are also being analysed.

Franchising has long been recognised by economists as a method of improving efficiency in the provision of goods and services in situations where (for a variety of reasons) it is not possible to establish a competitive market.
Basically the idea is that in sectors where it is not feasible to have competition in the market place (with all the associated incentives to efficient performance) then it may nevertheless be possible to have competition for the market.
A good example is provided by the regional ITV companies.
Only a single company is allowed to operate in each part of the country but the incumbent is given a licence for only a fixed period of time.
At the end of the franchise period the Independent Broadcasting Authority invites tenders and assesses whether the licence should be awarded to an alternative company.
The threat of losing the licence provides an incentive to the companies to maintain a high quality performance.
Recently the government has started to implement policies which extend this principle to many of the services carried out by local authorities and by health authorities.
The results of putting these services out to competitive tender have proved to be controversial with proponents claiming significant improvements in efficiency and critics claiming a substantial worsening in service quality.
The project will investigate empirically the effect of putting services out to tender and will carry out comparisons with authorities where services have not tendered.
The study will provide recommendations on how to make tendering effective, in particular in relation to contract specification, the organisation of the tendering process and the monitoring of contractors' performance.

Changes, such as large scale redundancies, initially involving one group of workers in an area within a large metropolitan region subsequently affect employers and workers in other sectors or other parts of the region.
These repercussions generally follow because of induced changes in patterns of migration, commuting and occupational mobility.
The problem is to assess how responsive these processes are and what the residual long-term effects are on employment prospects in the area initially affected.
The project aims to develop a general set of answers to these questions, relevant to any metropolitan region, and to look at a set of current labour market issues in Greater London and the Outer Metropolitan region (including West Kent.)
These issues include: whether the continued decentralisation of population from Greater London improves or worsens the job prospects for those remaining there; the effectiveness of new job creation in off-setting employment lost through redundancies; the relationship between skill levels and unemployment in inner London; housing policy influences on labour mobility; and the effect of outward movement on women's employment prospects.
This study arises from previous work in the Urban and Regional Studies Unit on regional unemployment and migration and a study of household movement in the London region.

The falling size of the UK workforce and the growing pace of technological change has increased the importance of training for many businesses.
This research aims to provide a clearer understanding of the problems of adopting new technology and the implications which this can have on training provisions for UK businesses.
The research will examine the adoption of new technology within a local labour market using Sheffield as a case study.
The analysis will investigate different types of new technology which have been introduced, the effect of new technology on the size of the company's work force, resulting training requirements and skill shortages.
Variation between companies with different characteristics such as size, growth, and ownership will be carefully evaluated.
After a general review of all Sheffield companies analysis will concentrate on the introduction of new technology in Sheffield's metal and engineering industries.
These traditional industries have been particularly hard-hit by the recent recession and their attempts to become more competitive by introducing new technology will be carefully analysed.
Their reasons for adopting new technology will be examined and their demand for skilled labour or training policies to retrain existing employees will be quantified.
the principal method of investigation is by interview surveys with companies.

The number and complexity of schemes of aid to small businesses in the EEC have grown rapidly in recent years.
But it is doubtful how many extra jobs have been created: many jobs in assisted projects would have existed without aid.
In some cases it is also hard to measure scheme cost, eg where aid takes the form of tax concessions.
The research will investigate job creation and cost in South Yorkshire, Nord-Pas de Calais and West Vlaanderen.
Small business recipients of aid in each area will be surveyed to assess the number of extra jobs created, and the survey data will be used to supplement and adjust published job creation figures.
Methods of measuring cost will be developed where they do not already exist, and will be applied to scheme data.
It will thus be possible to measure the effectiveness, in terms of cost per job, of the various schemes of aid.
Secondary measures of the effectiveness of aid schemes, such as improvement of industrial structure by promotion of rapidly growing industries or minimisation of the time spent by business on scheme administration, will also be used.
It is hoped that the results of the research will help governments to weed out ineffective schemes of aid and to expand successful ones, or to introduce proven schemes from abroad.

During the Later Middle Ages, there was an increasing shortage of coins which some historians believe led to a trade depression.
However, it can also be argued that the ‘bullion famine’ did not have such a catastrophic effect because merchants could use credit instead of cash to keep their businesses running.
What banking services there were, had been developed on the continent by Italians, and were not widely available outside the capital cities like London, so provincial merchants must have employed other forms of credit.
Postponing payment and so becoming indebted to business partners was common, so it is possible to talk of debt being a form of credit.
This project will examine the records of Extents of Debt in the Public record office in London, which relate to a group of merchants identified as being based in Yorkshire.
By examining who they owed money to, and vice versa, it will be possible to identify the nature of the credit arrangements merchants used as well as the geographical direction in which debt/credit flowed in or out of Yorkshire.

The difficulty of obtaining small amounts of external finance on adequate terms has been widely recognised as a major constraint on the formation and growth of small businesses in the UK.
This ‘equality gap’ reflects both demand and supply factors.
On the demand side, small business owner-managers often do not fully appreciate the advantages of equity finance and consequently are reluctant to surrender equity to outside investors.
On the supply side, the main sources of equity investment notably the Business Expansion Scheme, the venture capital industry and the Unlisted Securities Market are aimed at larger ‘small’ businesses.
Recent research in the USA and Canada suggests that the supply of informal risk capital fills the equity gap.
Informal investors or ‘business angels’ tend to be wealthy individuals (often successful entrepreneurs) who are willing to invest some of their personal wealth in small businesses.
Anecdotal evidence confirms that informal investors also operate in the UK but there has been no research to assess their role and significance in the financing of small businesses.
This research seeks to fill this important gap.
Its aims are to examine the scale and operation of the informal risk capital market in the UK, to assess its contribution to closing the ‘equity gap’, and to identify the characteristics of business angels in the UK and to compare them with their counterparts in North America.
The research findings are intended to help efforts to enhance the operation of the informal risk capital market in the UK, notably by identifying ways in which the pool of business angels can be increased and highlighting improved methods of matching firms wishing to raise equity capital with informal investors.

Since Professor Gower put forward proposals for a new form of incorporation for small firms in 1981, a debate has continued on the desirability and feasibility of introducing a new legal regime for small businesses in the UK.
Despite much academic debate, little empirical evidence concerning these structural issues has been obtained from those most affected by small business law, the owners of small firms.
The research aims to ascertain whether or not there is general satisfaction with existing legal forms among small businesses, and whether there are any aspects of the regulations which give particular rise to concern.
The study includes an examination of the effects of differences in the tax regimes applicable to companies and to unincorporated firms.
The reaction of small businesses to recent deregulation measures,(especially those contained in the 1989 Companies Act) will also be monitored and evaluated.
The principal method of investigation will be a pre-piloted mail questionnaire survey of small businesses in four areas, supplemented by follow-up interviews of a sub-sample of respondents and professional advisers.
It had originally been intended to limit the survey to two areas, but additional funding to enlarge the sample has been made available by the DTI, with whom the results will be discussed in detail.
In the light of responses, and in the context of the law in other countries, the researchers will assess the need for further reform of the law.

This project is designed to provide analytical indexes (computerised and manual) to a series of account books and other estate and administrative papers (c.1560-1630) amassed by Nathaniel Bacon of Stiffkey which are rare, if not unique, by virtue of their quality and extent.
Their contents will add to our knowledge of all aspects of small communities in the early modern period as well as enabling the first comprehensive study of a squire-dominated community in this period.
The data derived from this project should also permit some investigation of the extra-parochial dimensions of community in a manner which is difficult, if not impossible, in studies based largely upon parochial and manorial records.
An opportunity will be provided, therefore, to examine current concepts of historical communities and to assess the extent to which different socio-economic sub-groupings lived within a number of different communities.
The data will also permit dynamic analysis since within the short period of 70 years covered by these records, villagers lived first under three resident minor gentlemen, then under a powerful and well connected one (Nathaniel Bacon) and, finally, under an absentee one (Sir Roger Townshend).

The Centre is now in its second year after being formed from the Scottish Housing Research Group established in 1982.
A mix of short term policy oriented research and longer term projects aimed at the development of theory is pursued, which reflects the Centre's intention to promote contacts between researchers and those more directly involved in policy and practice.
In addition, in its role as a Designated Research Centre the scope of research has been widened and contacts have been made with researchers in many other countries, including USA, Sweden and France.
Members of the Centre have also acted as consultants to OECD on housing taxation policies and housing rehabilitation.
In order to disseminate research findings and to maintain contact with policymakers, the Centre has held Public Policy Seminars and Conferences on policy-related issues: a recent example was a seminar on housing allowances and the housing benefit scheme.
Informal seminars have also been held with housing practitioners to discuss prospective changes in government legislation.
The Centre has instigated a Discussion Paper series to disseminate research findings.
The Centre also organises a Housing Study Group funded jointly by ESRC and the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust.
This group holds two seminars a year in different parts of Britain and brings together housing researchers and practitioners to discuss policy issues.
Recent topics have included housing planning, decentralisation and tenant participation and housing policy into the 1990s.

Revision courses are also offered for students studying privately for the Institute of Housing qualification and it is hoped to provide some help to tenants' groups in the area.
Also, from October 1986, the University is offering an M.Phil in Housing Studies which is two years part-time or a one year extension to the Housing Diploma.
Amongst recently completed research projects is an evaluation of repair and maintenance procedures for public housing in Scotland.
This involved an overview of housing repair provision in 62 Scottish housing authorities (District and Island Councils, New Town Development Corporations and the Scottish Special Housing Association) and a more intensive analysis in 6 case study authorities of repair provision, costs and tenant satisfaction and involvement.
A systematic, district level database for Scottish housing with a view to guiding the Housing Corporation investment strategy has also been prepared.
Current research work is focused around six major themes, within which researchers carry out specific projects either with ‘core’ ESRC resources or as shorter-term projects funded by housing agencies.
At present 16 staff are employed in the Centre, 5 funded by the ESRC, 4 by the University and 7 on other research funding.
Finance from ESRC constitutes around 40 per cent of Centre resources.
The six themes are at unequal stages of development in that some have already been broken down into specific research projects whereas others are at a more exploratory stage.
The six themes each of which is led by ESRC or
1.
Modelling the housing market
Investigators: A O'Sullivan, and D Maclennan
The primary objective of this field of study is to build on the unique Glasgow database and previous modelling experience in the USA to formulate a model of the local housing market in Glasgow.
Although the database is the richest data source for such an exercise in the UK, more empirical work needs to be done, particularly on the supply side of the system, and further theoretical development is needed.
The work will not be confined to the Glasgow area.
Housing authorities throughout Britain are required to develop housing plans or strategies which encompass the private sector, and many central government concerns such as the amount of Green Belt land to be made available to developers can be elucidated by the use of local market models.
The major objective is, therefore, to formulate a model which can be used by central government and local housing authorities in the housing planning process.
2.
Housing and neighbourhood revitalisation
Investigators: D Maclennan and K Kintrea
This theme seeks to expand previous work of the Centre on rehabilitation policy and neighbourhood change.
In the UK, different local authorities have developed a range of renewal policies but there has been little attempt to evaluate their effect in the wider urban context.
At present, the Centre is engaged upon a range of projects in this theme including work in the neglected field of rural revitalisation in liaison with the Housing Corporation through a CASS studentship.
3.
The Evolution of public housing
Investigators: D Clapham and P Kemp
The public housing sector is currently undergoing rapid change and many commentators are referring to the ‘residualisation’ of the sector.
In response to these general changes many local housing authorities are pursuing innovative ways of attracting private finance, often coupled with a devolution of control to tenants' groups.
Glasgow District Council's scheme of ‘Community Ownership’ is an example of this.
Some other local housing authorities such as Islington or Walsall are pursuing schemes of widespread decentralisation of housing management.
These innovations are leading to an increasing diversity in the public sector and are posing a whole set of research questions concerning their effects on local authorities and tenants.
The major objective will be to monitor these innovations and to attempt to evaluate their effects.
Tied in with this, the Centre is carrying out work funded by the DoE to monitor and evaluate trends in housing management in both local authorities and housing associations in an attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of management practices and identify ‘good practice’.
4.
Household wealth, housing choices and labour market behaviour
Investigator: Ms M Munro
One project being actively considered is on household wealth and inheritance.
For many households, housing is the major available asset and it may constitute a central way in which wealth is transferred between generations.
This is particularly important because we are now moving into an era when many of Britain's first wave of home-owners will be bequeathing homes to relations, many of whom will be home-owners themselves.
This is only one aspect of the relationship between wealth, housing and the labour market which is important and complex with two-way interactions possible.
An important objective of the Centre will be to elucidate these relationships.
In addition, a research proposal has been submitted to the Leverhulme Trust for a study of the influence of housing tenure on mobility through an investigation of the effects of redundancy on labour market and housing in 3 regions.
This work is to be directed in conjunction with A MacGregor, Department of Social and Economic Research, and is the outcome of discussions on the interactions of housing and labour markets.
5.
Housing for disadvantaged groups
Investigators: Ms S Smith and D Clapham
The Centre is carrying out some work concentrating on the housing circumstances of particular disadvantaged groups.
Research projects are concerned with housing for the elderly, the mentally handicapped and mentally ill and it is hoped to carry out research on the housing circumstances of single women, ethnic minority groups and the physically disabled.
6.
Housing finance and its reform
Investigators: D Maclennan, A O'Sullivan
Stemming from our work with OECD and the Duke of Edinburgh's Inquiry into housing in Britain, the Centre is currently developing a programme of work on finance issues.
To date, a range of papers have been completed on local authority pricing, rent controls, housing taxation and rehabilitation subsidies.

Recent summits between the major OECD economies have attempted to coordinate the fiscal and monetary policies of countries.
Although stimulation of an individual country may not work, joint reflation of the OECD economies may help to get out of a world-wide recession.
One reason for the apparent failure of international cooperation in macroeconomic strategies is political, since any individual country has an incentive to deviate from an agreed plan of coordinated policies.
Another reason is that little empirical evidence is available on the potential gains of coordination, because existing multi-country econometric models pay insufficient attention to the supply side, volatility of exchange rates and the international mobility of capital.
This research constructs a small-scale multi-country model of the eight main OECD economies, which takes account of the above criticism and is related to ongoing research in the Centre for Labour Economics on the supply side and on the estimation of a small-scale model of the UK economy.
It has a clear theoretical structure, which builds upon imperfect competition, over-lapping wage contracts and relatively efficient financial markets.
Differential game theory is applied to various theoretical models and, eventually, to the empirical model in order to discuss the gains of coordination and issues of credibility and reputation.

Current economic thinking, and policy, is dominated by the idea that most of the unemployment we observe can be explained by labour, market ‘imperfections’ such as trade unions, minimum wage legislation uncertainty and lack of labour mobility.
Present economic theory in fact says very little about how a market containing such imperfections would operate.
The first part of the research uses game theory to analyse wage bargaining and employment decisions in models with explicit institutional setups.
The aim is to construct a theory of the firm, and trade unions, as coalitions with internal conflicts, collaborating for mutual gain.
This should provide a theory of wages showing the role of strikes, arbitration procedures, wage differentials and unemployment as information transmission mechanisms.
By building a macroeconomic model on these foundations, the investigator can then study the reaction of wages, profits and employment to different economic policies aimed at aggregate demand or labour market imperfections.
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
The Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Scheme was set up to enable social scientists, who have obtained a doctorate, to work full-time on original and independent research for a three year period.
There was no preference given to any particular subject area.
All applications were considered by a Panel, the majority of members being drawn from the ESRC Standing Committees.
In October 1985, it was decided by the ESRC that no new postdoctoral fellowship awards would be made in 1986 or beyond.

The 1985 Transport Act requires local authorities to make explicit decisions on the value of maintaining public transport services, particularly in the evenings and on Sundays.
Public transport services clearly have direct benefits to those who use them but there are additional benefits of public transport provision.
For example, non users may value the emergency cover provided in the event of a car breakdown; may appreciate the availability of services for other household members and may benefit from the use made of services by others, for example , friends and relatives visiting them.
Other benefits which come from having one's community served by public transport might include economic and social vitality.
To the extent that these indirect benefits are not usually incorporated informal evaluations the value of public transport services is clearly being underestimated.
The aim of this project is to include these additional benefits.
This will obviously involve estimating the value of these benefits.
Household interviews will be conducted and individuals will be asked questions which will be carefully designed to allow us to estimate their valuation of given public transport services.
We will examine how these valuations vary with the type of service on offer and the socio-economic characteristics of the population.

The Labour administration elected to the Greater London Council in 1981 was committed to an extensive programme of economic intervention, to be supported by economic research on a larger scale than previously experienced in local government and with radically new approaches to generating and implementing policy.
The experience of the GLC between 1981 and 1986 in putting this into practice is of great significance, not only in changing the role of economics and employment objectives within planning but also for its lessons about the nature and potential effectiveness of local economic policies.
The aim of this research is a critical appraisal of the effects and effectiveness of the GLC's economic strategy.
The research will describe the nature of a selection of the strategy and policy initiatives; set out the empirical evidence used in building the strategy; assess this against other evidence which might have been used at the time and against current practices; use this and other evidence to evaluate the effects of policy; and comment on the main successes and failures of the strategy.
The main sources will be GLC documents supplemented by discussions with those involved in the strategy at the time.
Analysis and monitoring of policy since the abolition of the GLC in 1986 will also be used.

Many reports, and particularly the Black Report and the more recent Health Education Council ‘The Health Divide’ have used the relationship between occupational class and death rates over time to demonstrate that inequalities in health between socio-economic groups have been increasing since 1951 and perhaps since 1931.
The project starts from the premise, demonstrated in the investigator's work, that measures of occupational class cannot be validly used over time and that the conclusion of increasing health inequality is scientifically unsound.
The project is consequently attempting to use other data for assessing change over time.
Some items of information, like occupational class are always available in mortality statistics, eg. age at death, gender, cause of death, country and region of residence.
Each has a social component so that potentially the social significance of various rates, ratios and relationships can be used to interpret trends.
If successful, such techniques could be applied across many countries rather than those few which possess occupational data.
Mortality statistics of most Western European and a few other countries are being used to develop and test these new measures.

In a recent book ‘Privatisation and Regulation’, edited by John Kay, Colin Mayer and David Thompson (currently or associated with the Institute of Fiscal Studies), privatisation was identified as having one of three forms: denationalisation, deregulation and franchising.
The economic rationale, in terms of economic efficiency, was agreed in terms of increasing competitiveness, rather than the change of ownership.
Most of the empirical work — almost exclusively UK based — focussed on denationalisation and deregulation.
Franchising, putting out to tender publicly funded services (such as refuse collection) or natural monopolies (commercial services at airports), was only slightly covered.
This study helps fill that gap.
The study follows up previous research on six case studies for catering, cleaning and laundry services (‘Public Administration', summer 1987, forthcoming).
The aim is to look at experience, in respect of cost savings, for catering and cleaning services for all hospital contracts in one regional health authority up to the financial year 1985-86.
Previous research indicates, proportionately speaking, the savings could be very large.
Differential effect by type of service are also predicted, with larger cost savings for domestic contracts because of greater competition from outside contractors.
More detailed effects will also be examined, based on the breakdown of data by type of expenditure (wages, other expenditure) and application (in-patient, out-patient, etc.).

The Seminar Group is, we believe, the one workshop based series on Urban and Regional Economics in the UK.
It provides an opportunity for researchers in academic institutions, central and local government, the private sector and other agencies to meet and discuss the discipline generally, as well as the specific papers and themes.
In recent years seminars have been held on the Inner City, Local Economic Development, Urban and Regional Economics and on Emerging Information Society, Northern Ireland and the Local Labour Market.
Special attention has been paid to the areas highlighted by the ESRC itself, such as Northern Ireland and Environmental Economics.
Also many of the ESRC Initiatives in the last few years have been able to disseminate their initial findings and results through the Seminar Group.
It is the view of the group that it has another role in promoting dialogue on particular areas of concern: the comments on ‘Data Sources and Research Methodology’ produced last year are an example.

Rural Europe is in transformation.
Social and economic as well as agricultural structures are changing.
A five-year research programme between nine EEC countries and 3 other European countries was launched in 1986 to assess the evolution of agricultural structures in different socioeconomic contexts across Europe, the impact of structural policies and the extent and nature of pluriactivity (multiple jobholding) amongst farm families.
The latter is increasingly seen as an important factor in rural development.
The work will be done through a series of surveys backed by structured essays on the national and regional backgrounds (Context Studies).
The first Survey (1987) will establish the basic conditions and the work and income patterns of pluriactive farm families.
The next 3 Surveys will investigate in greater depth the factors that assist or impede the various activities of farm families on or off the farm, whether agricultural or nonagricultural, paying special attention to the impact of policy.
The Surveys will yield some 15,000 records, which will be deposited with the ESRC Data Archive, where they will be merged and made available for analysis at local, national and European level.
Under the direction of an international Steering Group, a number of research teams are responsible for the national Surveys, which are carried out using a commonly agreed methodology.
The Arkleton Trust(Research) Ltd provides overall management and coordination, as well as the comparative analyses of the data submitted.
The Surveys are funded by the participating countries with assistance from EEC.
The current ESRC award is to enable research officers to be appointed to assist with the international comparative analyses of the first results of the research programme.

The main purposes of the Bureau, which was established in September 1983, are to improve the accessibility of macroeconomic models; to promote general understanding of the properties of models of the UK economy; and to allow comparisons between models to be made more easily.
There are six macroeconometric models currently deposited with the Bureau, namely those of the London Business School, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Oxford Economic Forecasting, Her Majesty's Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Liverpool Research group in Macroeconomics.
The models are integrated into a common operating framework at the University of Warwick Computer Unit.
Access to outside users is via the joint academic network (JANET) and in addition a special PC program has been developed which uses standard simulation results to provide a ready reckoner of model responses to changes in policy variables or in the external economic environment.
This package has been very successful in meeting the needs of those wishing to use macroeconomic models as an aid to their understanding of the economy, for example it is now widely used in teaching.
The Bureau publishes a Newsletter three times a year which gives information on new versions of the models deposited with the Bureau, on recent Bureau Discussion Papers and on the Macroeconomic Modelling Seminar programme it arranges.
This typically comprises two half-day meetings in London and a residential conference at Warwick each year.
The Bureau's comparative research programme comprises a continuing analysis of model properties and forecast performance.
A full understanding of differences in model properties requires detailed analysis of particular model equations or groups of equations.
The Bureau has undertaken several studies which have combined systematic econometric testing with economic analysis of particular equations or sectors of the models, and has been able to reconcile and resolve many of the differences in treatment between the models, in turn translating this resolution into its impact on full model properties.
Extensions of this work in future will continue to examine such differences by econometric and economic analysis, but will increasing emphasize the role of particular sectors in the model as a whole.
Such an approach has become possible now that the overall structures of the models fall broadly within the same theoretical framework.
Greater attention will be given to the nature of the long- run solution of the models, and the degree to which inter-model differences in the long run and in dynamic adjustment can be explained by empirical differences in economic approach.
Appropriate methodology has been developed for examining the historical tracking performance of large-scale macroeconometric models which contain model-consistent expectations and this now enables attention to be focused upon historical counter-factual experiments, paying particular attention to the treatment of policy in such exercises.
The results of this research programme are disseminated at the pre-publication stage through a Discussion Paper series; the success rate in placing these papers in academic journals is remarkably high.
An annual comparative properties paper is published in the National Institute Economic Review each August.
The Bureau's second four-year period of support ends in September 1991.
It is expected that a bid will be made to the Macroeconomic Modelling Consortium for further funding after 1991.

‘Countryside interpretation’ tends to mean static displays aimed at informing a receptive public about the life and geology of the area they are visiting.
With the help of the ESRC, the Yorkshire Dales National Park hope to transform countryside interpretation into an active and creative means of bringing landowners, policymakers and the public together to work on the best way to manage one of the great scenic treasures of northern England, yet maintain a healthy rural economy.
Five of the dales of the Yorkshire Dales National Park have been designated as environmentally sensitive areas.
This means that farmers in these dales may opt to be paid a certain amount per hectare by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food to manage their lands so as to ensure the traditional landscape features of stone buildings, field walls and flower-rich meadows for the enjoyment of the public.
This programme can only succeed if the public are able to understand what is being done with their money, and why, and are encouraged to work with the landowners concerned so that the most practical and cost- efficient results are obtained.
The research will involve the financing of a full time research assistant who will work with the National Park Interpretation team devising new approaches to countryside interpretation, and evaluating the success of the experiments tried out.
The results will be implemented in a long term interpretation programme for the Park, a programme which hopefully will be adopted elsewhere.

This programme will seek to develop a framework for economic modelling within which links between the decisions of individual agents (firms, households, unions) and the behaviour of the economy at an aggregate level are more clearly established than is usually the case.
Particular emphasis will be given within this framework to the ways in which regional economies interact with one another and to how their behaviour influences the way in which the national economy works.
Since there is a wide diversity of opinion in these matters a range of alternative views will be investigated so that‘monetarist’ as well as ‘Keynesian’perspectives will be considered.
To enable investigation of a plurality of views the modelling framework will be one which is designed to answer counterfactual or ‘as if ’ questions rather than one which attempts to predict what the position of the economy will be in a number of years.
The framework will therefore be better suited to simulating the consequences of different kinds of economic behaviour rather than determining what form economic behaviour has or is likely to take.
A model with these capabilities will provide an important means through which systematic investigation of the effects of economic policies on different spheres of economic activity may be conducted.

The aim of PROPE is the development and study of quantitative methods for macroeconomic policy design.
The methods developed are applied to large models of the UK economy, such as the model of H. M.
Treasure.
International economic models such as the World Economic Prospects model of H.M. Treasury, are also used.
The methods are aimed at providing answers to specific questions in policy design.
These questions are:
(i)
international policy coordination;
(ii)
the design of policy in the presence of rival models purporting to represent the same economy;
(iii)
the design of policy in the presence of specific constraints imposed by the decision maker;
(iv)
the specification of an objective function for optimal policy calculations;
(v)
computation of the expectations of individuals in society;
(vi)
determination of (feedback) relationships between instruments of policy, such as government expenditure, interest rates and tax rates and the state of the economy.
The methods necessary for the above problems invariably require computational techniques implemented on powerful computers.
Nevertheless, at least some of the problems can be solved on personal computers or desk-top workstations.
The specific methodology required for these computational techniques involve concepts from the theory of games, control and optimization theory.
Assessing and validating their usefulness, on the other hand, requires macroeconomic theory, knowledge of the economic models and econometrics.

The present Soviet economic system was formed in these years; Mr Gorbachev and his colleagues, in endeavouring to reform the USSR, are deliberately seeking to build on the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of the traditional system.
In previous research projects supported by ESRC and other funding agencies, an inter-University group based on Birmingham has investigated many aspect of Soviet industrialisation, including quantitative developments, government policy and the economic structure.
In the present project this work will continue, with particular attention to national income as a whole and to the transport sector.
Following the previous detailed studies of economic trends in 1925-33, a preliminary investigation will be undertaken of 1934-6, the years before the ‘great purges’ when Soviet industrial development was most rapid.
A summary volume on quantitative Soviet economic history, prepared under the editorship of the project investigators by nine authors from six universities, will consolidate and disseminate the previous research.
During the period of the project the inter-University seminar on Soviet industrialisation will continue to meet regularly five times a year in Birmingham; and a conference will be held of the International Work-Group on Soviet Economic History.

From the records of property holding in the city of London between c 1200 and 1666, it is possible to trace a remarkable sequence of changes in the fabric of the city, the density of settlement, the property market, and the social and economic structure.
This was demonstrated in a recent study of the Cheapside area in the centre of the city, supported by the ESRC (Project Reference: D/00/23/0044).
Conclusions drawn from that study raised new questions concerning the size of early medieval London; the degree of its late-medieval contraction and of the renewed growth in the early modern period; and the varying contribution which, at different times, population levels, standards of living, commerce, and the role of the city in the kingdom made to the pattern of London's development.
*
In Stage 2, the degree to which trends in the centre of the city reflect the development of the whole are being investigated by means of a comparative study of the suburb lying outside Aldgate, an area of very different character from Cheapside.
The research methods suggest new ways of assessing important factors in urban development, and of exploiting one of the largest and least-used bodies of source material for European towns in general.
The Museum of London provides assistance in kind for the research team, which contributes to the educational work of the Museum as well as that of the University.
Among the products of the research are guides and gazetteers of detailed information which makes a wide range of source material accessible to scholars and other enquirers.

The Irish Ordnance Survey Memoirs are descriptions of the northern half of Ireland, written to accompany the first Ordnance Survey maps between 1830 and 1840.
They are a most important source for local history, archaeology and social and economic studies but have been mostly unpublished and difficult to use.
This project aims to complete the transcription and machine indexing of the handwritten manuscripts.
This follows a feasibility study funded by ESRC (1984-1986) in which the methods were successfully demonstrated and half the material was processed (10,000 sheets).
Copies of the manuscripts are made for editorial work; the texts are prepared and dictated; these are input to micro and then mainframe computer.
Then an indexing programme called QUILL, developed at Queen's University, is run on the full texts, also thematic searches can be made for interested users.
By completing work on the remaining Memoirs, the full value of the database already created and in use will be realised.

This project is designed to make the Continuous Household Survey (CHS) run by the Policy, Planning and Research Unit (PPRU) of the Department of Finance and Personnel (Northern Ireland) available to researchers for secondary analysis.
The survey commenced in 1983 and collects data from approximately 1% or 3000 households in Northern Ireland.
The project is being undertaken with the support and cooperation of PPRU.
With the problems encountered by the 1981 census in Northern Ireland the CHS represents a major potential data source for secondary analysis by researchers both in Northern Ireland and in Britain.
The CHS routinely collects dat on the demographic, social and economic characteristics of households and individuals.
It also includes a section measuring attitudes towards social issues.
At present the dat are stored on a SIR database management system and generally inaccessible to researchers.
This project involves the creation of two SPSS files containing ‘general’ information common to all years of the CHS; one organised with individuals as the unit of analysis and the other based on households.
Files will also be built around specific themes (eg divisions in Northern Irish society, education, health, housing etc.) identified by the principal investigators and in response to requests from researchers.
A full documentation of each file will be prepared and the data will be lodged with the ESRC Survey Archive.

Public capital includes many of the physical assets on which everyday life depends, such as roads, reservoirs, schools and hospitals.
However, the management and financing of capital assets in the public sector has given rise to many problem areas, such as those associated with capital controls and deferred purchase arrangements in local authorities, poor asset utilisation, deteriorating physical condition and problems of financing asset replacement, and questions of how capital should be incorporated into devolved budgetary arrangements, such as the Financial Management Initiative in central government.
Many of these problems involve the neglected interface between public sector economics, accounting and financial management.
This project examines the precise nature of the problems on this interface across the public sector as a whole, both in conceptual and analytical terms, and in terms of identifying potential policy solutions for the improved management of public capital assets and expenditure.

Indonesia is one of the largest and most rapidly developing of the new states, of considerable economic and strategic significance to the rest of the world.
The importance of the study of elites, as a way of assessing political attitudes and change, is well established, but there is little know of the social background of the members of Indonesia's parliamentary bodies, the People's Representative Council and the Supreme Deliberative Assembly.
The research to be undertaken will attempt to remedy this deficiency.
Using official biographical data, a study will be made of the geographical origins, age distribution, religions, education, occupations, and foreign experience of the members elected or appointed to the two bodies mentioned in 1982 and 1987.
The research will thus delineate the social profile of these deliberative assemblies, and also show whether the characteristics of the 1987 members differ significantly from those of 1982.
The work complements previous research on the social background of the Indonesian civil service, also financed by the ESRC.

No previous study of Scottish medieval prices exists, mainly because information on the subject is scarce, and scattered widely through a number of sources.
However, a pilot study has shown that if the available data is collected and sorted by computer, enough survives to enable something of the overall pattern to emerge, especially through comparison with the much more plentiful English data.
Information about the movement of Scottish prices will add to our knowledge of almost every aspect of Scottish medieval economic history.
International trading patterns, debasement and changing money supply, demographic and climatic change may all influence the behaviour of prices.
Wage evidence could also be noted, but it is even scarcer than price data, and it remains as yet uncertain whether any particular trend swill be discernable.
Additional studies on weights and measures, and Scottish numismatics will also be undertaken to assist in the interpretation of the collected price data.
A large proportion of the available Scottish medieval material has been published and these printed sources will allow much of the work to go on in Oxford, but subsequent work on manuscript sources, especially in London, Durham, Edinburgh and Aberdeen is envisaged.

This research is part of a wider investigation into the changing role of the multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the world economy.
It will examine the main determinants of international production and foreign direct investment and how these have changed over the last 50 years; the way in which decisions are taken within multi-national enterprises; the changing forms of international involvement, and the impact of the activities of MNEs on the home and host economies in which they operate.
The conceptual framework for this work will be based on the three main intellectual strands; the theory of international trade; the theory of market failure; and the behavioral theory of the firm.
It is the juxtaposition between these three strands which will influence not only the industrial and geographical pattern and form of MNE activity; but how it affects the international allocation of resource and the world economic welfare.
Data for this research will be obtained both from interviews with MNEs and from the data bank on MNEs and international investment now being assembled at the University of Reading.

The long term competitiveness of industry depends upon investment in research, leading to the introduction of new processes and products.
Successful innovation in most industries today requires a global strategy towards research and development.
The project addresses two major issues.
Firstly, the international location of fundamental research facilities by multinationals, and the effects on the trade performance of the UK and other European countries.
This involves a detailed examination of patent data, as a means of assessing the strength of the innovative activity that companies carry out in Britain by comparison with other countries.
The investigation looks at the determinants of the international location of research facilities, and at the impact of this on exports, outward investment, and economic growth.
It also shows how the location of research by individual firms varies with their competitive position in terms of profits, sales and corporate growth.
Secondly, the project considers the R&D policies of multinationals operating in the UK.
This relies upon the responses to interviews and questionnaires of managers of UK multinationals with foreign R&D facilities, and of managers of foreign firms which have invested in R&D in the UK.
Particular attention is paid to the organisational structures that have been developed to support global research strategies.

To forecast where the economy is heading, economists need information on where it is now, and where it has been in the recent past.
Yet subsequent sizable revisions often show how unreliable are preliminary economic data.
Like good wines, data improve with age.
How the vintage of data affects the quality of UK macroeconomic models and their forecasts is the central theme linking the three broad sections which comprise this project.
First, revisions to the national income accounts will be described, quantified and analysed.
Second, the modelling implications of data revisions will be investigated.
Evidence will be gathered on the robustness of key relationships in the main UK macroeconomic models to changes in data vintage.
An understandable desire on the part of model proprietors to produce forecasts and assess their accuracy as quickly as possible leads to a situation in which relationships are estimated on one vintage of data but assessed on another.
The potential gains from consistency will be measured.
Also, it is planned to model the data revision process itself, and to incorporate this process formally within the full structure of the macroeconomic model.
The third aim of the project concerns accuracy analysis: how sensitive to data revisions are standard tests of forecasting accuracy?

The aim of the project is to study the implications of changes in patterns of international trade and industrial structure for UK employment.
The main emphasis will be on the determinants of competitiveness and trade performance and how this in turn affects the demand for labour by industry.
The framework for the research and a major tool of analysis will be provided by the Cambridge growth Project macroeconomic model, as maintained by the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick.
The proposed research has three main parts.
The first aims to summarise historical developments in trade performance and employment in the UK.
The second part will examine the role of innovation in the success or failure of various industries using econometric techniques on time series data.
Finally we will investigate the implications for present and future employment of improving the innovative performance of British industry.
This will be based upon simulations conducted using the macroeconomic model which will be modified to take account of the econometric evidence accumulated in the second part of the project.

For the past 30 years almost all economic analysis of decision making in situations of risk and uncertainty has been based on expected utility theory.
There is now a growing body of experimental evidence to show that individuals behave contrary to expected utility theory in systematic and predictable ways.
In response to this evidence, many new theories have been proposed.
One of the most controversial of these is regret theory, of which Professor Sugden was one of the first formulators.
Regret theory has several surprising predictions that had not been tested at the time the theory was first presented: for example, it predicts that individuals' choices may ‘cycle’(eg A is chosen in preference to B, B in preference to C and C in preference to A).
Later work, including a recent ESRC- supported investigation by Sugden and Starmer, has tended to confirm these predictions.
This project will extend this work by subjecting regret theory to further and more stringent tests and possibly by revising and extending the theory in the light of new findings.
The main research method will be experimental: volunteers will be recruited to make choices between different chances of winning or losing small sums of money.

One of the major areas of historical research in recent years involving scholars from several countries has been the rise and decline of slavery in the Americas and its impact on the growth of the industrial societies bordering the north Atlantic.
Within this research area, particular attention has focused on the expansion of Britain's slave-based Atlantic trades and their contribution to early British industrialisation in the eighteenth century.
In seeking to explore the links between trade, slavery and industry, historians have been handicapped by lack of detailed evidence about the scale and pattern of Britain's trade with Africa and the Americas and about those participating in such activity.
By combining information on ships and shipowners found in the Liverpool Plantation Registers with material on the voyages of the same ships to Africa and the Americas gleaned from other trade and shipping records, it is possible to reconstruct in considerable depth a major port's involvement in the Atlantic trades at this time, and to begin to assess their impact on economic change in its hinterland.
Material from the Plantation Registers and other shipping records for the period has been collected and collated under previous projects supported by the ESRC.
By arranging these materials into a machine-readable form, the aim of this project is to make them as widely accessible as possible to other researchers working in this and adjacent fields of historical enquiry.

The question of how financial markets and institutions contribute to industrial performance, and therefore how well they serve an economy, is growing in importance.
The project approaches this question by examining the financial system in a country which has done well economically.
The investigation will focus on three main areas where Japanese financial structures and behaviour differ from those in other industrialized economies.
First, the role of government, direct and indirect, in providing finance for industry has been distinctive but also controversial.
The research will examine the behaviour of government institutions directly providing finance for industry, such as the Japan Development Bank, as well as the interaction of government and private finance when both sources have been available to industry.
Second, the high degree of commitment between private lenders and borrowers in Japan is particularly obvious in lender's attitudes to firms in financial difficulty and the research will examine the circumstances under which firms are rescued by their bankers.
Finally, the research will examine the relationship with lenders and investors in certain firms in electronics industry where difficult-to-value investment in research and development is crucial.
The project will use published data from the balance sheets of a large sample of firms together with interviews with government and private bankers and with firms in the electronics industry.

A basic problem in our understanding of technological change is that economic and organisational analysis of change have in the past been poorly integrated.
Studies have tended towards one of two main traditions.
The first has concentrated on purely economic aspects, such as the incentives for innovation or diffusion, without considering what happens inside the firm to cause and implement change.
The other has focused on organizational process, the management of technology.
This has often treated technology as an end in itself, and not queried its wider relationship to firm activity or weighed its contribution to performance.
This dichotomy leaves too many open questions about why firms differ so much in their handling of technology, or what ‘really’ determines technological performance.
The current research programme aims to bridge this gap by looking at the interplay between organizational processes of technological change and economic consequences.
It forms the core of a major new ESRC/DTI research initiative on Technology and the Firm.
We believe the combination of economics and organization provides a way to help integrate different approaches to change.
It may also provide key lessons in what firms can do to use technology more effectively.
The main body of the research consists of a number of in-depth case studies to see how firms develop or use new technology, taken over periods of several years.
We will follow the process of search, formulation and implementation of technological change.
How are technological decisions made, and how does this affect the outcomes?
How is technology integrated into overall firm operations?
What does this teach us about ‘successful’ change?
The project will cover a range of industries and types of change, linking in with the extensive analysis of technology from the economics and managerial literature.
There will also be series of shorter case histories and articles bearing the points of argument.
To provide a common framework for the disparate studies, the approach is oriented around corporate and technology strategy.
This implies that technological change should be seen not as an isolated activity, but as integral part of firm operations, and that change is evaluated via its contributions to market success.
We hope to identify effective processes for change, such as those involving integration of different functional interests, progressive plans for change, and flexibility.
An area of particular interest is the means by which competition may motivate change.
Clarification of issues such as these should be of great significance to both business strategy and government policy.
This and other projects in the initiative will complement each other in specific areas.
The current project is scheduled to take place over a 5 year period, with a budget set at 500k.
This is a joint project lead by the Centre for Business Strategy and the Organizational Behaviour functional area at London Business School, and includes the participation of several other disciplines in the school.

The Money Study Group (MSG) aims to bring together academic and professional economists, many of whom would otherwise be working in isolation.
The MSG promotes contacts between academics, civil servants, Bank of England officials, private bankers, stockbrokers, and others interested and working in the fields of money and banking, finance, and macroeconomic policy.
It carries out these aims primarily by holding regular seminar meetings, usually six a year, and an annual conference.
The MSG is distinguished by the breadth of its interests and the wide range of its membership.
It promotes discussion of new ideas and provides a facility by which academics, researchers, policy- makers, and practitioners in the City can meet and debate issues of current importance.
The group provides the principal open forum for serious broad-based discussion of monetary and financial issues on a regular basis in the UK.
The programme for 1988/89 is organised so as to maintain the flexibility necessary to allow for the covering of new research results and to enable distinguished overseas visitors to present papers to the Group.
However, it is anticipated that the following issues will be among those discussed: implications of the October 1987 global stock market crash; international economic policy co-ordination; Britain and the EMS; and the regulation of financial markets in the wake of ‘Big Bang’.

The objective of the Economic Theory Study Group is to stimulate work on Economic Theory in the U.K. and promote the dissemination of research findings.
To pursue this objective the Study Group organizes one day meetings and two day conferences.
These are based upon invited research papers on a particular topic.
Both types of forum allow for critical discussion and the research papers discussed are often subsequently published in leading economics journals.
Members unable to attend are circulated with the research papers on request.
Economic Theory is the term given to the study of the underlying principles or what are more colloquially called the ‘laws’ of economics.
Whenever economists make predictions or offer advice they use principles.
For example in thinking about the consequences of a change taxes an economist would point to the relationship between price and quantity sold.
Thus the ‘law of demand’ that the higher is the price the less will be the quantity demanded guides the economics predictions regarding tax changes.
Economic theorists are concerned with critically examining and revising the ‘laws’ of economics.
The work of the Economic Theory Study Group is thus complementary to the work undertaken by all other Economic Study Groups financed by the E.S.R.C

After the nuclear debate, the greatest social issue facing Western countries in the next twenty years will be the lack of jobs for young adults aged 16 to 25, especially in the depressed regions.
The research will examine new career patterns which young people are trying to establish in both Middlesbrough and Duisburg, in such areas as self-employment, enterprise projects, cooperatives and community projects.
New careers in alternative economies, in the black economy and in voluntary work will also be studied.
A number of hypotheses, derived from the writing of British and German authors on youth unemployment and the social condition of young adults, will be tested in discussion with 16 to 19 year olds.
The questionnaire developed by the main ESRC 16-19 Initiative will be administered (with local additions) in order to compare the Middlesbrough sample with those in the main study.
A variety fo quantitative and qualitative techniques will be employed during twelve months of intensive fieldwork, followed by three months of writing-up.
Particular attention will be paid to the social implications of the study and the findings will be disseminated through publication and, it is hoped, through an Adult Education class for Headteachers, employers and trade-unionists in both Durham and Duisburg.

Post Keynesian economics, a school of thought which finds its inspiration in Keynes, Kalecki, Joan Robinson and Sraffa, is distinguished by its insistence that history, social structure, and institutional practice be embodied in its theory and reflected in its policy recommendations.
It stresses the need for constant review and renewal of theory and policy as circumstances change, and the necessity for partial, open systems approaches to complex problems.
It rejects the theoretical approach which claims University but which in fact consists of the interplay, in a closed system, of motives of atomistic, undifferentiated, instantly-adjusting ‘agents’.
It regards this latter approach as misleading, sometimes dangerous, basis for policy advice.
Post Keynesian economics has passed an important turning point in its maturity: its phase of critique of mainstream theory and of exegesis has established its foundation for forward-looking development of Keynes's method and insights applied to modern economic processes.
This development is now underway and rapidly gathering strength.
The purpose of this Study Group is to provide a forum for the presentation and active criticism of research, to promote contact between those of similar views, and thereby to encourage still further research and dissemination of results, amongst interested specialists.It is expected that the activities of the Study group will generate many papers of publishable quality.

The last twenty five years have witnessed national major changes in both the structure of housing tenure and the occupational structure.
Private renting has now been largely replaced by owner occupation and council renting and manufacturing jobs have increasingly disappeared, whilst managerial and professional jobs have shown a rapid increase.
Nowhere have these changes been more marked than in London and the South East, and the research project aims to document the two sets of changes and to examine their inter-relationships and policy implications.
In the late 1960's and early 1970's, policy makers became increasingly concerned that the South East may be becoming more and more socially ‘polarized’, as the more highly skilled and highly paid moved out of inner London to better jobs and better housing around London.
This project addresses the question of how far different areas of London and the South East have become more and more geographically differentiated in terms of both socio-economic status and housing tenure.
It focuses on the extent to which areas of socially heterogeneous private renting have been replaced by areas of higher economic status owner occupation and lower status council renting and it examines the nature of processes involved.
The project makes extensive use of census data for 1961, 1971 and 1981, the OPCS 1% sample longitudinal survey 1971-81 and social survey research in selected areas of London.

The Rural Economy and Society Study Group (RESSG) provides a forum for research discussion amongst those working in the social sciences on the social and economic formation of rural areas in the Advanced Societies.
The group stages a series of day meetings throughout the year in which members present research findings and debate theoretical and practical issues of relevance to contemporary rural society.
Such meetings provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to make contact with others working within their field and to develop research initiatives.
A residential conference is held once a year to allow more sustained and detailed discussions around particular countryside issues.
The RESSG also provides a vehicle for the dissemination of research work in the form of edited volumes.
Publications generally comprise a collection of papers from the annual conferences, complemented by specially commissioned work.
Current membership of the RESSG stands at just over 100 — members are drawn from a range of academic institutions and disciplines from both this country and abroad.

RB00232234 Investment is a topic that has been heavily researched both econometrically and by means of interview studies.
Several puzzles remain, however, most notably in understanding the way in which expectations are formed and in the difficulty in econometric research of capturing a strong interest rate effect.
It is possible that the traditional tendency for researchers to exclude uncertainty variables from tested models may result in mis-specified models and false conclusions.
The research aims to quantify uncertainty variables in respect of different components of GDP, interest rates, and prices.
Several plausible measures of uncertainty will be devised and constructed.
Some effort will be made to distinguish uncertainty from mere volatility.
The theoretical and empirical relationships between the constructed measures will be explored.
These quantitative measures of uncertainty will then be entered in a number of investment formulations to see how they perform.
The statistical problems of estimation from one of the major challenges of the project.

Port books have been neglected in the past as a source for internal trade in the proto-industrial period because of the nature of the source — it is vast and at the same time problematic.
Prior to the application to Council, a research project financed by the Polytechnic, Wolverhampton based on sample from the Gloucester and the Bristol port books had developed a database capable of storing and retrieving commodity and topographical data.
Also a logical framework of definitions for the terms used had been established which demonstrated the consistency of the source.
Prior to the application to Council a research programme financed by the Polytechnic, Wolverhampton based on sample years from the Gloucester port books succeeded in devising a database capable of storing and retrieving information about the voyages of boats passing up and down the Severn through Gloucester and the cargoes they carried.
An evaluation of the source established the accuracy of the information it contained and formulated definitions for the various terms employed.
The first aim of the ESRC funded project is to complete the Gloucester database, to revise it as necessary in order to arrive at an optimum design for future use, and to publish the final version in the form of a book of statistical tables.
Part of the revision will be the preparation of a microcomputer version which could be used as a reference and teaching resource in colleges, libraries and museums.
The database will also be expanded to include port book data from other parts of England and Wales with the object of devising a standardised format for computerising port books.
This will be promoted through the Association for History and Computing.
Also a guide will be published providing a definitive introduction to the source.
As a result future databases should be directly compatible with one another thus considerable increasing our understanding of the mechanisms of inter- regional internal trade.
Finally certain research topics will be published drawing on the Gloucester and Bristol port book data, for example studies of the Ironbridge Gorge before the Industrial Revolution and of the economy of Bridgnorth 1630-1800.

The aim of this study is to discover the relationship between the availability of transport, and the problems of deprivation in inner cities and in other urban areas with economic and social problems.
The study aims to see how far problems of these areas are caused by inadequate transport facilities.
It will concentrate in particular on the difficulties which people have travelling to work, in travelling in their search for jobs, and in travelling to health facilities.
Household surveys will be carried out in four low income areas of Merseyside, both to discover the overall pattern of transport use in these areas ant to discuss in detail the problems of people in low income families.
Major objectives of the study are to identify those aspects of urban deprivation which can be improved by changes in the availability of transport facilities (both public and private) and propose changes in local and national government policies which can help in a reduction in urban deprivation through action in the transport sector.

In 1982 the ESRC initiated a three year comparative research programme, with a budget of almost £500,000, to examine inner city problems in the context of major structural and spatial changes occurring in Great Britain.
The Programme was based on a research agenda proposed in the Final Report of the Inner Cities Working Party which was published in 1981 (The Inner City in Context, ed Peter Hall).
The research sought to identify the key factors affecting urban economic change, to examine the consequences of change for the urban economy and the employment of inner city residents, and to assess the effects of public policies in impeding or facilitating urban adjustment to change.
Four city regions were chosen for detailed study: Clydeside was selected as an example of an area which had suffered persistent economic decline and social malaise, the West Midlands as an area of ‘faltering growth’, the Bristol region as an example of relatively successful adaptation, and London where the two contrasting areas of the inner south-east and the outer south-west were selected.
To these four initial studies a fifth study of the Newcastle metropolitan region was added, funded by the Department of the Environment.
In addition, a number of smaller scale thematic studies were commissioned to provide national data on urban conditions and trends and to explore selected issues that cut across the city studies.
The Programme was directed, by Mr Victor Hausner, based at the Policy Studies Institute.
The research phase of the Programme was completed during 1985, and attention then turned to dissemination and debate of the findings.
As a first step a condensed introduction to the themes explored in the work was published by ESRC (Changing Cities, Victor Hausner and Brian Robson, 1985).
This was followed by a series of seminars and briefings which focused on the policy issues raised by the research, and specific lessons for the improvement of urban policy and practice.
The detailed results of the Programme appear in a set of eleven volumes being published (by Oxford University Press) during 1986/87.

Most young people in Britain grow up in families, and it is generally acknowledged that the family plays an important part in the development of the future adult.
Yet little is known about the influence parents, brothers and sisters have upon young people's social identities.
The research aims to uncover if and how family members shape young people's economic and political identities as they emerge in mid to late adolescence.
It will look at life histories of family members, the distribution of resources, and the activities and routines of family life in order to illuminate how beliefs, values, attitudes, expectations and patterns of behaviour are transmitted between family members.
Twelve families, each containing two young people aged 16 and 19, will be selected according to father's occupation and the elder child's age of leaving full-time education and his or her qualifications.
This provides four family types based upon the assumed future socio-economic class of the 19 year old child — stable middle class, stable working class, upwardly mobile working class and downwardly mobile middle class.
The aim is to identify the elements shaping social identity which are shared by all the family types and those by which they differ.
Structured and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with fathers, mothers and children.
Interviews will be tape recorded.
Attitude and self-assessment instruments, developed for the main study of the 16 — 19 initiative will also be used.

The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) has been awarded a research contract to four researchers at the University of Stirling.
The award of 47,890 is made under the ESRC/DTI research initiative on ‘new technologies and the firm’.
There is concern that British companies have not invested sufficiently in research and development and this has adversely affected economic performance, particularly in new technology areas.
It may be that this is affected by the accounting method used and this will be the main thrust of the Stirling study.
The research will be undertaken jointly by Stirling's Departments of Accountancy and Business Law and Business and Management.
Team members will be Dr A Goodacre (Coordinator), Dr Richard Thomas, Mr Ken Pratt and Dr Rob Ball.
In the UK most R & D costs have to be set against profit immediately, thus reducing profitability in the short term.
Since managers may be assessed on short term profitability, heavy investment in R & D may adversely affect their rating; a second worry is that firms which invest heavily in R & D may be ‘undervalued’ by financial institutions.
This may make it more difficult for these firms to raise finance in the future: the Stirling study will cover both these questions.
Firstly, managers involved in R & D investment decisions will be interviewed to seek their views on factors which influence these decisions and whether they are affected by the way this investment is accounted for.
Secondly, investment analysts will be approached to investigate how they view companies with substantial R & D investments, again with particular interest in accounting practices and disclosures.

The social and economic functions of the countryside are undergoing marked change, in response both to significant shifts in agricultural, environmental and planning policies and to increasing demands placed on rural land.
It is important to examine the uneven nature of these pressures and attempt to predict the prospects for different localities in the context of an evaluation of the potential effectiveness of alternative means of regulating change.
The research programme will focus on the question of land development broadly defined to encompass, for example, a switch towards less intensive farming, the planting of amenity woodland and the residential and industrial development of rural land.
What are the patterns of capital investment in the countryside and how do they affect property rights and changes in the use of rural land?
What are the consequences for rural communities?
And what sorts of policy changes are required in order to balance the production, ecological and amenity functions of the countryside?
The enquiry will be based on detailed case studies, including corporate and state interests operating at the national and EEC levels, as well as local employers, landowners and pressure groups in three different rural districts — Copeland (Cumbria), Aylesbury Vale (Buckinghamshire) and East Devon.

It may seem obvious that employers' work-force policies will affect employees' experiences of work and their outlook towards work.
But it can also be argued that the employer's influence is small, compared with the influence exercised by individuals' education, occupation, and political affiliation, all of which are matters decided outside of employment.
Questions such as these can only be studied with information which includes details of employers' policies alongside details of employees' perceptions, attitudes and experience at work.
An unusual opportunity to do this has arisen from the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative, which has gathered information in precisely this form.
As part of the work on this Initiative, the employers and employees' data will be Linked on the Oxford University computer, and used to investigate the impact of policies such as the balance of external recruitment and internal promotion, introduction of new technology, use of part-time, temporary or casual workers, and efforts to involve employees in the organisation.
Michael White from the Policy Studies Institute will be working with the central team at Nuffield College on this investigation.

The reform of both workforce training and of pre-vocational preparation in schools, in order to raise productivity, are now accepted priorities of government policies.
This programme of research is concerned with the measurement of Britain's shortfall in manufacturing productivity in comparison with other advanced industrial countries, and with tracing the relation of that shortfall to differences in vocational training and in machinery.
The Institute's earlier comparisons focussed on Germany, France and Japan, with particular emphasis on the craftsmen-level of qualifications.
These comparisons will be extended to the Netherlands; further comparisons at both pre-vocational level, and at technician and foreman level, are planned for France and Germany.
Much of the planned research involves fieldwork based on samples of manufacturing plants in the countries to be compared, the plants being matched for industrial sector and size employment.
Comparisons will be made of output per employee in selected operations, workforce qualifications, incentives to employers and to individuals to invest in training, and type of machinery installed.
Other studies will be based on detailed comparisons of returns for the Censuses of Production for each country.
Earlier research at the Institute compared Britain with Germany and the United States; in the present phase the comparisons are to be extended to France and the Netherlands, and previous estimates for Germany and the United States are to be updated.

Rates of housing construction, both private and public, have declined considerably in most western European countries since the early 1970s.
Socially this is a serious problem because most of these countries were experiencing housing stress of one kind or another even before the recent downturn in house production.
At a superficial level, this failure to meet housing needs could be attributed simply to ‘the recession’ that has afflicted western capitalist economies since the early seventies.
But this would be too simple an answer because there are many possible reasons to explain poor performance in the housebuilding industry.
These include uncertainty about effective demand, so-called land shortages, high interest rates, obsolete building methods, public expenditure cuts and a shifting of effort to overseas.
This study aims to analyse the structure, mode of operation and financing of the key private and public agencies of housing provision in eight western European countries (France, Greece, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom and West Germany).
The study seeks to identify the main constraining factors operating in each country, and to see to what extent these factors, and the ‘mix’ in which they seem to operate, vary from one country to another.
The research problem is large in scale and this particular project is seen as a pilot study which should open up further fruitful areas of analysis.
It is hoped that the research findings may, in due course, help in the task of formulating more effective policies to overcome housing stress.

The research investigates changes in industrial structure and work organisation in the British and French manufacturing sectors.
During the 1950's and 1960's large firms using specialised technologies to produce standard products in mass rose to dominance in many industrial sectors.
More recent developments have led observers to question the inevitability of this trend.
The role of small scale production units has increased in a number of industries.
There is evidence of large firms experimenting with flexible technologies and divisions of labour to produce a broader range of products and cater to speciality markets.
This study will provide evidence on the extent of these new developments in Britain and France and relate them to changes in economic, technical and institutional conditions.
The investigation is planned in two stages.
Using published sources, a region in relative decline will be contrasted with a relatively expanding region in each country.
Differences in regional performance will be related to differences in industry structure.
The regional overviews will form the background for detailed case studies of the engineering sector.
At this stage interview evidence will be used to assess the factors determining firm choice as to location, plant size, technology and division of labour.
The research should be relevant to the current debate on industrial policy.

Industrial collaboration with university interdisciplinary research centres is designed to foster pre-competitive interdisciplinary research in key new or generic technologies.The knowledge base involved can vary from strategic basic research to actual production.
Examples include the high temperature superconductivity IRC at Cambridge or the telecommunications Engineering Research Centre at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
IRCs as a mechanism for collaboration have become increasingly important in recent years and are likely to remain so.
In seeking to better understand this collaboration various issues need to be addressed including:
what motives prompt collaboration in IRCs; to what extent does the orientation of IRC research allow for serendipitous discoveries; what are the implications for control of intellectual property rights; what is the relationship of the IRC to the rest of the university and to other faculties?
Five IRCs will be taken as case studies, three from the UR and two from the US.
In each country one will be focussed on fundamental research and one on applied or engineering research The study will take the form of a literature survey, questionnaire and in depth interviews.
The data collected will be used to analyse the results of these particular collaborations; their impact on universities, firms, academic disciplines and general academic culture as well as the rate, direction and social process of science and technology development.

The purpose of the study is to chart and analyse the emergence of informal or ‘de facto’ industry standards in the software market.
The research will comprise a small number of case studies of leading software items, including PC applications software (especially spreadsheets, word processors and databases) and operating systems.
The research is conceived in two parts though they are inter-related.
The first takes as its point of departure recent theoretical economic models of the emergence of market defined standards, which emphasise the role of networks of users and supporting products, as well as certain strategic actions of the firm, notably pre-announcements, licensing and disclosure.
The research will collect and organise data on these, with a view to evaluating the economic models.
The second goes beyond these models and data, to produce a sociological account of how the software designer and user is influenced by the presence and absence of standards, of how images and perceptions of standards and compatibility are formed, and how accounts about standards and compatibility circulate amongst the community of designers and users.

This project is part of the ‘New technologies and the Firm’ research initiative sponsored by ESRC/Department of Trade and Industry.
it falls under the sub-heading of ‘Skills and the Workforce’.
Its objectives are to clarify the role of scientists and engineers in the process of technological change.
The main contention which the authors intend to examine is that the role of such personnel can only be understood in dynamic context.
Existing theories of the way in which the labour market for such occupations operate tend to be based within a static framework, concentrating upon contributions to current output rather than to the dynamic process of technological change and economic growth.
The project will collect new data, as well as exploiting existing information, in order to examine the link between a company's employment of scientists and engineers and its economic performance.
It is hoped that the result can be generalised to the macroeconomic level and that useful insights will be provided about the performance of UK companies in an increasingly competitive international environment.

In 1978, an SSRC (ESRC) working party produced a report on ‘Research Needs in Work Organisation’ which identified the main limitations in British research.
These included a concentration on a few sectors, a bias towards managerial and commercial interests, a limited appreciation of relevant contexts, the lack of a historical perspective, and a disciplinary imbalance including insufficient attention to economic factors.
Work organisation is taken to cover inter alia work and job structures, technology, control, employment and the labour process, and research has also tended to be fragmented as between these aspects.
As a result of the work of the Working Party, the Council decided to establish a Work Organisation Research Centre at the University of Aston Management Centre, and awarded a grant of £278,371 to set up a programme of research.
The Work Organisation Research Centre opened on 1 April 1982, and its work will continue until 31 March 1987.
The Work Organisation Research Centre's programme is intended to address some of these limitations.
This programme, entitled ‘Work Organisation in Britain: A Comparative, Longitudinal Investigation into the Problems of Innovation in Technology and Work Organisation’ covers five projects.
The first project involves the collation and review of existing source materials in key areas such as technology, innovation, managerial work organisation strategies and labour market analysis.
The second consists of case study investigations within eight sectors into the designing and introduction of work organisation innovations, together with associated changes in manpower allocations.
The third and fourth projects are comparative studies into
(a)
the ideologies, recipes and activities of those who actually organise work, and
(b)
forms of contracting relationships in the conduct and organisation of work (such as franchising) and the processes of control associated with these.
The Centre intends as the final project in this programme to conduct one or more surveys of salient work organisation characteristics in order to secure comparative data on the extent of variation in work organisation both within and between sectors.
The ESRC funded project into ‘The Response to Microelectronics in the Service Sector’ is closely associated with the Centre, and has conducted investigations into new technology and work organisation in banks, hospitals and retail stores.

For nearly two decades public policy has been directed at supporting existing small businesses and encouraging the creation of new ones.
This has been widely seen as an area where employment can be created and economic vitality encouraged.
The success of policies designed to develop this sector of the economy depends in large part on the knowledge and awareness policy makers and the small businesses have of one another.
The central aim of this research is to explore the basis of this relationship by focussing on three key aspects which bear directly on the effectiveness of public policy initiatives in this sector.
First it will examine the consultative arrangements which exist between a number of key government agencies and representative bodies.
Second it will explore the nature and role of those bodies which claim to represent the particular interests of small business.
Third it will assess the consequences for individual small business of the results of government — small business consultation.
The research will involve interviewing leading officials in government and representative bodies and a detailed survey of the small business sector in two Districts of Greater Manchester.

Starting and staying in business is more difficult for certain types of people than it is for others.
One aspect of this is the environment within which the new business operates.
The research is concerned particularly with attempts to establish new enterprises in difficult economic environments such as those to be found in large public-sector housing estates or inner-city areas.
When these enterprises do manage to take hold the next key question is the extent to which they hire from the local community and from disadvantaged groups (e.g. the long-term unemployed).
Investigations will be carried out in six urban areas concentrating on small firms located in managed workspaces and on less conventional new enterprises, such as community-based initiatives of one kind or another.
Effort will be put into establishing the role of governmental supports in creating additional enterprise, the contribution of the private sector and the longer-run viability of these new businesses.

Most social and political theories formulated in the period immediately after the Second World War tended to view the industrialised societies of the West as set on a path of continuous economic and social development.
But, since 1970, it has become clear that these societies are subject to major changes which require systematic research and enquiry.
The ESRC has adopted the context, adjustment and management of change as its research priority for the remainder of this decade.
Most of the present problems of industrial societies are felt acutely in the United Kingdom, which make it an ideal starting point for comparative research and analysis.
The research is reviewing the current state of empirical research in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, into aspects of change in industrial societies.
The final report will indicate key questions which need to be tackled and make suggestions about ways in which this research might be improved.

This project examines the relevance of their academic training to the experience of social scientists with higher research degrees working in empirical social research.
How well does social science training in different subjects equip its graduates once in the labour market to conduct various types of quantitative research, particularly survey research?
Such social researchers work for survey research agencies, in central and local government research divisions, commercial market research companies, and academic research posts.
A sample of managers in such organisations, of staff recruited from social science postgraduate work in the last five years, and of academic social scientists doing the training will be interviewed as the main part of the study.
The study is particularly concerned with the extent to which social science research students acquire skills in quantitative methods and are able to use them after making the transition to employment in social science research.

This study will examine various organisational forms of international collaboration in defence and civilian research and development (R&D) and attempt to formulate a set of variables with which they can be evaluated and collaboration as a form of organisation assessed.
In doing so it is intended to make a significant contribution to information for policymakers.
International collaboration in R&D is seen as a way of preventing costly duplication of work and diseconomies of scale.
However, despite an increase in collaborative ventures criticisms have been made of this form of organisation.
The study will assess the claims made for both the costs and benefits of international collaboration.
Among the benefits most frequently claimed for collaboration are: i That there are cost savings for both R&D and production, by sharing costs and through longer production runs.
ii European collaboration will help create an industry able to compete with the US.
For example in aerospace it is claimed that European collaboration allows advanced research to be undertaken which would be too expensive on a national basis.
There are also political and military benefits to further unifying Europe.
iii General economic benefits in the form of domestic jobs and balance of payments benefits.
iv Collaboration is also said to lead to greater technical rigour.
The costs associated with collaboration include: i Where national bureaucracies are involved there are delays in procedures and high transaction costs; ii Generally inefficiencies arise through the work share arrangements, duplicated administrative costs and delays caused by the need to harmonise requirements and delivery schedules.
The study will examine various organisational forms of collaboration using aerospace as a case study.
Hypotheses will be formulated and tested using variables, such as cost savings, development times and profitability.
Information will be collected from various publications which provide data on output, exports, market shares etc.
Interviews will be conducted with staff from MOD, DTI and company executives.
The resulting work will be of use to policy-makers by providing a critical, through assessment in a field dominated by myths and emotions

In the last two decades the British economy has suffered from high unemployment, and until recently, high inflation and low productivity growth.
It is clearly necessary to find a unified and consistent explanation of all these phenomena and by doing so to find ways of doing better in the future on all three points.
Most people would agree that the institutions of the labour market are central to understanding these issues.
The work of the CLE to date has concentrated mainly on the problems of unemployment and inflation, and the CLE has developed a widely accepted framework for looking at those subjects.
In the new programme they would focus heavily on what determines productivity.
In particular they would study how this is affected by labour market institutions (such as unions and payment systems).
The second major issue to be examined would be the role of individuals and how human potential is mobilised.
In particular they would study the process by which entrepreneurs are produced, and how unemployed people once more become productivity workers.
Finally they plan to investigate what determines how an economy will respond to shocks, and how shocks, which are often quite small, can have such long-lasting effects.
This is the issue of flexibility and adaptation.
Thus the work can be grouped under three headings:
A. Technology, productivity, employment and institutions
B. Mobilisation of individual potential
C. Flexibility and adaption to shocks
In deciding what to work on, a collective review of the main gaps in their understanding of the British labour market has been made by the CLE.
They then considered how best to fill these gaps — what research strategies, and what people and resources would be needed.
An important feature of much of the work will be the use of firm-level and establishment-level data.
This has been surprisingly little used even in the US, and the recent work by the CLE on it has had considerable impact in changing the direction of labour economics around the world.

In the last few years there has been some debate about the provision, role and effectiveness of postgraduate training in the social sciences in the UK.
This study aims to provide new and up-to-date information about the processes and results of doctoral level postgraduate study in the social sciences, and about the labour market for doctoral social scientists.
It is part of a major programme of research work initiated by the Training Board on Research Training.
The research will investigate the relationship between postgraduate training in the social sciences and employment, focusing in particular on the demand from employers across the economy for doctoral social scientists from different disciplines, the flow into employment and early careers of such students and the contribution made by doctoral study to the labour market and the academic and professional communities.
Data from a number of different sources will be collected and analyzed.
It will include an investigation of existing sources of information about the social science student population and their employment.
More detailed information will be sought from national surveys of higher education, employing organisations and former students, supplemented by interviews.

Northern Ireland is facing a largely ignored rural crisis.
Agriculture there employs proportionally many more people than in Britain, and is characterised by small, owner-occupied holdings which are largely dependent on livestock products.
Half of these farms are too small to be liable businesses, and many produce too small an income to support the household.
Rural unemployment is unacceptably high.
Unless action is taken soon, many rural areas will become economically unsustainable.
The two universities in Northern Ireland are pooling their expertise to look for solutions to the crisis.
What decisions are the remaining farmers making about land-use and their own labour?
And how are they constrained?
Constraints may include land-quality, the consequences of migration of farm-household members, opportunities for off-farm employment, the political force of rural interest, and local and family values such as commitment to the land.
Without a scientific analysis public policy-makers may only make the problem worse.
To do justice to the complexities Or the situation, the universities have assembled a research team which represents a wide range of social and environmental sciences.
The team will.
base its study primarily on an interview survey of a large, representative sample of land-holders throughout Northern Ireland.
Key political and organisational representatives will be interviewed in the UK and EC.
To show diversity, the team will also look in more detail at a number of small geographic areas.
An environmental survey and a study of inter-generational differences on family farms will be carried out in those areas.

Many theoretical contributions have recently concluded that firms in dominant market positions may be able to impede competition by strategic behaviour.
For example, certain kinds of investment, advertising and research and development expenditures may allow firms to maintain their market position against encroachment from existing and new competitors.
If correct and if such practices are widespread they clearly have important implications for competition policy.
However, there has so far been virtually no attempt to find out either how significant such policies are amongst leading firms or whether some are more prevalent than others.
The major objective of the study is therefore to investigate empirically the strategic behaviour of such firms.
The principal method of investigation is through statistical analysis based upon a questionnaire survey of marketing and product development executives, supplemented by interviews.
In addition, an analysis of strategic actions uncovered in existing competition policy cases in the UK, EC and US will be undertaken to highlight the problems that strategic behaviour poses.

Community studies and life course research are undergoing a revival of interest within Sociology and related disciplines.
This study is based on the collection of ‘life course’ materials according to generational group in a Welsh community which was until recently dependent on the mining industry.
The main aim is to relate formative social influences on individuals and groups to the community's current experience and perception of social and economic change.
A contribution to community research, life course methodology and the application of recent sociological theory is intended.

In East Africa, where HIV virus infection and its resultant disease of AIDS is a medical serious problem, the context of its transmission is an increasingly urgent issue for investigation.
Since the disease is heterosexually transmitted in Africa, the group which has come in for the most blame for its rapid spread have been the many poor women who have been supporting themselves in Nairobi through commercial sex.
Through contacts formed in a previous period of field work with poor urban women of this category, the investigator is proposing to hold long open-ended discussions with a sample of older women and their daughters on the subject of AIDS: e.g. their knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease, the method of its transmission and finally their assessment of their own risk of contracting the disease.
Both samples of women will be involved in commercial sex, though the better educated younger women will be plying their trade in the hotels in the centre of the town, while their mother's customers will be drawn from the shanty towns on the periphery of Nairobi.
It is hoped that this study will permit the better understanding of how women with no other economic options can be helped to adjust their sexual-commercial behaviour to slow the transmission of the HIV virus.

Agricultural rural policies enacted in recent years and the trend of current debate indicate encouragement of farm diversification and the development of a wider rural activity base, increasingly environmental and conservation measures and a reduction in price support measures for agricultural commodities.
This project seeks to examine the extent to which multiple job holding in farm families is a normal feature of the agricultural sector in Scotland.
It seeks to identify if changes are occurring and, if so, whether those changes will lead to substantial alteration in the appearance of the Scottish countryside and its ability to sustain wildlife.
It also seeks to identify the impacts that any extensive move to pluriactivity in farming families would have on regional economics.
These considerations have an important spatial context which is being resolved by the use of Geographic Information System technology.
The project is complementary to work going forward in Wales and Northern Ireland and to a European programme, which is wholly or partly funded through JAEP.

Bargaining theory is used in economics to explain how terms of exchange are determined in small-number settings, such as negotiations between a union and a large employer.
According to one school of thought, a bargaining problem can be fully specified in a mathematical form, and then a unique ‘solution’ can be deduced; rational bargainers, it is argued, would settle on this solution.
An alternative school of thought, associated with Thomas Schelling, argues that rational bargainers can be influenced by non-mathematical ‘cues’ which distinguish one potential agreement as particularly prominent (a ‘focal point’): this gives rise to a self-fulfilling expectation that agreement will be reached at this point.
The object of this research is to test Schelling's hypothesis, and more generally, to develop a methodology for investigating the concept of focal points.
An experiment will be carried out in which pairs of individuals bargain over the division of a sum of money.
The mathematical structure of the bargaining problem will be the same for all pairs, but different pairs will be given different cues.
The idea is to see if the terms on which bargainers settle can be influenced by such cues.

The research project has two main aims.
The first is to gain a comprehensive picture of the development of industrial relations practices and procedures in the banking industry for the period specified.
This in conjunction with previous research would provide a continuous monitoring of the industry from the early sixties.
The primary source of this would be accounts given by the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union.
The second aim is to highlight the growing impact of technology on these industrial relations practices and on the overall structure of the industry.
For as satellite banking, teller terminals, on-line data facilities, point of sales terminals and other innovations are installed, then one can locate those pressures for change.
These will directly affect the career structure within the banks, causing distortions, blockages and a recorded division of labour.
Already one can see the old ‘paternalism’ of the industry with its hierarchies and job guarantees having to give way to different business practices which take greater account of technical exigencies.
The sources for this aspect will once more be the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union and interviews with senior banking personnel.

The aim of the project is to study the issue of civil rights and individual liberties in Russia from the mid-nineteenth century to 1917.
Research centres on two specific questions:
(1)
the development of a civil rights movement as an intrinsic but distinct element in the social and political opposition to the regime;
(2)
the internal passport system examined in its legal and institutional aspects, and its effect on labour mobility.
The project aims to provide a clear definition of the concept of civil rights.
It redresses the imbalance in the existing historical literature of the period, which is heavily weighted in favour of economic and political issues.
It adds considerably to our knowledge of the position of the individual in late Tsarist society and to a general understanding of that society.
It provides a useful point of departure for a historian of the present-day civil rights movement in the Soviet Union.

Increasing returns in an industry imply that from the viewpoint of industrial efficiency larger units of production have cost advantages over smaller units.
The existence of significant economies of scale within the economy also means that the standard theorems of welfare economics on the efficiency of a market economy no longer apply, and additional mechanisms must be designed for achieving the advantages of increasing returns whilst avoiding the disadvantages of the exploitation of market power which large organisations may possess.
The project examines in particular a number of areas of economic policy where the existence of increasing returns can pose important problems which make inappropriate a simple reliance upon unaided market efficiency.
These areas include:
(i)
exchange rate policy when there exist indivisibilities or set up costs of switching between different industries in the presence of a non-permanent supply of North Sea Oil.
(ii)
the management of nationalised industries where important issues remain as to the most appropriate set of rules and controls under which to operate these industries.
(iii)
the transport sector where the appropriate pricing policies and balance between different transport modes again involves issues relating to the existence of indivisibilities and economies of scale, and
(iv)
problems of risk management in the presence of increasing returns with associated consequences for industrial strategy of choosing an appropriate portfolio of industrial investment in the face of uncertainty and increasing returns.
By developing the economic theory and analysis relevant to such problems of increasing returns and public policy, the project aims to provide additional insight into the associated policy problems and their solution.

Economic development in France has been the subject of a lively debate over the past few years.
Should the emphasis be on ‘stagnation’ and ‘retardation’in the nineteenth century?
Or can a more positive interpretation be sustained, with France emerging as a close rival to Britain from the eighteenth century onwards?
The majority of economic historians would probably incline more to the latter view now, though the extent to which revisionist case can be taken remains debatable.
Much of the recent work had been written at the ‘macro’ level, relying on statistics of national income or on general surveys of the economy.
What is needed is more work at the ‘micro’ level, undertaken in the light of recent developments in literature.
The project will use the cotton industry of Troyes as a case study for this purpose, to throw light on the strengths and weaknesses of French industry.
It follows earlier work by the investigator into industry during the first half of the nineteenth century.
Particular attention will be paid to costs of production in Troyes, commercial policy and the quality of business leadership.
Most of the research will be carried out in public and private archives in Troyes, and in the Archives Nationales in Paris.

The growth of government is a general phenomenon of Western nations since 1945.
Many theories purport to explain growth in terms of a single cause, economic, political or organisational.
But these theories have not been tested, and cannot be tested, without systematic empirical study of whether and to what extent governments change — and whether change sometimes involves contraction as well as growth.
This question is being investigated by a study of government in the United Kingdom since 1945.
The central questions are:
(1)
what changes when government changes?
What is the direction of change, and are rates of change regular or irregular?
(2)
Why does government change?
(3)
What are major consequences of government growing, contracting, or not changing in scale?
To understand how government changes, we need to conceptualise what government is, and what it does.
Government is not reducible to a single quantitative indicator.
The research starts by examining government as a plurality of organisations.
Government organisations draw upon three major resources: laws, public revenues, and public employees.
These resources are then combined by organisations into policies as programme outputs.
Appropriate measures of change are being specially developed for each element.
A series of seven related booklength studies are planned.
The first is an overview of big government.
Five studies will then follow about each of the five elements: laws, revenues, personnel, organisations and programmes, and a concluding volume about the consequences of big government.
There will also be a number of analytic papers, some involving international comparisons.

The Centre for Science, Technology and Energy Policy was established at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) of the University of Sussex on the 1 October 1984.
The centre is run as an integrated research programme within SPRU's broader research activities in the areas of industrial innovation and energy.
The objective of the research programme is to identify and explain the nature, determinants and economic impact of technical change in the UK and, in particular, the impact on
(i)
international patterns of trade and growth;
(ii)
structural adjustment, including firms' strategies and industrial structure; and
(iii)
the level and composition of energy supply and demand.
One common theme is to better understand the preconditions and effects of the diffusion of electronics based production technology on the structure and competitiveness of UK industry and or energy supply and demand.
In October 1993 a new Centre, for Science, Technology, Energy and Environmental Policy (CSTEEP) took over from the DRC

The far-reaching social impacts of Britain's prolonged economic recession have yet to be studied in detail by social scientists.
The research aims to investigate the ways in which British society has adapted to recession compared to other societies in Western Europe and North America.
Parallel studies will be conducted in six other Western societies.
The research provides, through a lengthy national survey, detailed information on how the experience of recession has affected such matters as relations at the work-place, the structure of the labour market, de-skilling and the impact of new technology, the division of labour within the family and the effects of unemployment.
The study also assesses the changes which have occurred since the 1960s in attitudes towards social and economic inequality and conceptions of social justice.
It measures the degree of consensus which exists, if any, over how rewards are distributed in society.
Comparisons with other societies will enable conclusions to be drawn concerning the adaptability of British society to economic change.

The structure of employment is changing.
There has been a shift of employment from manufacturing to service industries.
Many women now go out to work.
Technical progress is altering the demand for labour.
The investigation analyses the responses of households to these changes in the labour market, through research in a North-West town.
A survey of employers assesses the demand for labour.
A survey of households establishes the responses of such groups as those households with several working members, the unemployed, single-parent families and so on.
Also examined are how these households organise their domestic time and tasks, and their attitudes to the changing patterns of work and the problems which arise.
Of interest are the relations between changes in the labour-market and changes in household organisation.
Selected households are being periodically re-interviewed.
Simultaneously, there are case-studies showing in more depth how social resources are mobilised and capital accumulated in both the ‘formal’ and ‘informal’economies.

The establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976 saw the final re-unification of a country that had been divided since the late 19th century, first by French colonialism, and subsequently by, inter alia, international politics.
The new government, based in Hanoi, was confronted with many profound difficulties.
Vietnamese Communism had to cope with the problems of economic reconstruction in an area devastated by the years of war, and also with the integration of the South into the methods of social administration and economic management that were used in the North.
After the breakdown of relations with China in 1978/79, conditions deteriorated further as Chinese and Western aid was withdrawn and military resources were committed to toppling the Pol Pot government in Cambodia and defending the Chinese border.
Against this background, it is striking that almost no basic research into contemporary Vietnamese society is occurring.
Almost nothing is known about many important issues.
This research builds upon experience gained in the study of Vietnamese Agricultural Organisation (PhD thesis, Cambridge, 1982) to investigate Vietnamese Industry.
The study utilises the abundant Vietnamese source materials and other relevant data to establish the basic important facts about this part of Vietnamese society.

Much attention is now being paid to the contribution which differences in labour market flexibility might make to the explanation of international differences in unemployment rates and economic growth.
Judgements of this kind, however, require a deeper understanding of differences in the use of manpower as well as in wage flexibility and labour mobility.
This project's first concern is with the classification and analysis of unemployment in France and the UK.
This is followed by a more detailed study of sectoral and geographical differences in the use of manpower in the two countries.
The project aims to make it easier to compare research already being carried out in these topics by IER and INSEE, culminating in the holding of a comparative seminar.
The seminar will consider what has been learnt about the appropriate research methodology for such work and will examine the empirical findings of the IER/INSEE study together with those of other researchers in the field.
It will seek to bring out the points common to both countries and those which distinguish them.

Economic policy today is very much an international as well as a national matter.
Traditional analyses have concentrated on links between government policy, output, employment and inflation in one country.
This project aims to integrate the treatment of national issues within a coherent framework or analysis of the world economy and Europe as a whole.
The Group's objectives and research strategy imply a continuously evolving work programme whose content may change as it is realised that particular issues (or faults in past analyses) are of more or less central importance.
The research is a learning process and is most productive precisely when it changes prior views and expectations.
Policy issues
The Group retains a strong concern with the traditional macro-economic issues of fiscal and monetary policy, inflation, the exchange rates for sterling, UK trade policy and aggregate employment which its UK model was first designed to elucidate and which are still in certain respects important subjects of controversy at the analytic level (although there seems to have been some convergence of short-term and even medium-term conditional predictions).
The following aspects of policy are insufficiently studied and will remain for some years central preoccupations of the Group:
(a)
international interdependence especially its implications for fiscal and monetary policy, exchange rates, commercial policy, energy and the price of oil, and the European Community as a policy-coordinating and economic system.
(b)
the role of broad sectors in the UK macro-economy, particularly energy, manufacturing and services and the role of sectoral and ‘supply side’ policies in macro-economic strategy.
(c)
the internal incidence of macro-economic developments particularly as between the six conurbations, the fifteen or so large cities, and their hinterlands in the UK and the implications for local government, public finance and locational policy.
(d)
changes in the organisation of production and labour in the context of recession and their implications for pay, productivity, international competition and the quantity and character of employment.
The area of development which will endure as a crucial issue (perhaps more important than traditional one-country concerns) is the international one.
The impression has been strengthened in the past few years that macro-economic developments and policies are now essentially international in character.
Model development
The Group's main focus of development work now lies in the improvement and integration of the world, EEC and UK national models into a coherent system.
This alone would permit the evaluation of UK problems and policies in their international setting and clarify the implications of policy choices at the EEC level for the UK and the rest of the EEC as well as locating options for Europe as a whole in the global context by which it is powerfully influenced and constrained.
For the purposes of establishing an adequate correspondence between the UK model and the EEC model, and also because it seems increasingly important in its own right, the Group is considering when and how best to build a broad sectoral disaggregation into the UK model.
This will in turn help to take account of changes in the organisation of production and labour market structure (which differ rather fundamentally between sectors) and allow consideration of sectoral or supply-side policies.
Finally, after much preliminary research, the Group intends to attempt a disaggregation of employment, population and labour supply between geographical areas (the six conurbations, major free-standing cities and more rural areas).
Software
The main development objective is to produce a well-documented, user-friendly version of the main suite of programs with self-documenting or transport inputs and automated production of model manuals from the inputs by which the model is defined (the 1981 manual of the UK model was produced in this manner using a prototype version of the new system).
The programs will also be fully transportable for immediate implementation on any large machine.
Following the publication in 1981 of the ESRC Subcommittee report Macro-Economic Research in the United Kingdom, the ESRC convened a Consortium of experts to distribute funds made available by ESRC, HM Treasury and the Bank of England for research in the macro-economic modelling and forecasting field.
Twelve awards were made for programmes of research, all of which were under way by November 1983.
Ten of these are detailed below.
In addition, the consortium has established a Bureau in Macro-Economic Modelling to make the variuos models available to other researchers.
The Bureau was established at the University of Warwick on 1 September 1983 with a contract for a four year period in the first instance.
A second round of the competition will be in 1986

The Centre for Economic Policy Research began operations in autumn 1983.
It was established to promote independent, objective analysis and public discussion of open economies and relations among them.
Major grants from the Economic and Social Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, the Esmee Fairbairn Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bank of England have provided institutional (core) finance for an initial five-year period.
Modern economies are increasingly interdependent; policy-relevant research therefore requires large-scale, carefully targeted initiatives.
Research resources are, however, scattered across many universities and institutions.
CEPR draws primarily on academic researchers, co-ordinating the work of selected specialists from many institutions.
It brings them together with research sponsors and customers as well as with business and government economists.
CEPR is unconventional: it is a ‘networking’ organisation, not an in-house research institute.
Its functions are not always fully understood by academics and funding bodies.
CEPR's special role relating funders and researchers benefits both and goes beyond intermediation or ‘brokerage’.
The Centre provides valuable services to funding bodies, policy makers, the public, individual researchers and the research community as a whole.
CEPR enhances the quality of research carried out under its auspices.
It brings the expertise of highly-qualified professionals to a wide range of research projects.
Moreover, the Centre ensures policy relevance through its close contacts with Whitehall, Westminster, the City, industry and international organisations.
There is continuous feedback to the researchers and input from them into the policy debate.
The Centre's extensive programme of publications and meetings ensures wide access to CEPR's output and so enriches the work of its Research Fellows.
The Centre draws on many of the best economists in the UK, continental Europe and elsewhere and communicates their work to a wider public.
CEPR reaches out abroad, exchanging researchers and ideas in conference and large-scale common research programmes.
This international orientation is fundamental to the Centre's character.
The emphasis is on economic research, but the Centre is keenly aware that other disciplines are concerned with policy questions.
Social and economic history and demography have a key role in guiding policy-making beyond crisis responses towards fundamental medium- and long-run issues.
CEPR has therefore established one of its main research programmes in this area.
Multidisciplinary perspectives are important to the Centre's work and the dissemination of its results.
The Centre acts in an entrepreneurial role to bring new resources into economic research and make it more productive and innovative.
It has coordinated selected work already underway and proceeds to develop new research initiatives and channel resources to them.
The core of the Centre is its body of Research Fellows, drawn from the universities and retaining their academic base.
They are appointed for renewable two-year periods.
Most are from the UK, but foreign associates are also essential to the international role of the Centre.
The Research Fellows are the Centre's primary resource for publications, study groups, discussion meetings, workshops, seminars, and conferences.
Research Programme
The Centre's research priorities are focused on the improved functioning of the British and international economies.
The research is not, however, aimed towards superficial ‘applicability’ or ‘usefulness’, and CEPR seeks to avoid sterile methodological or ideological debates.
The Centre has limited its research agenda initially to four programme areas.
The topics in each will change over time, but there will be enduring emphasis on international dimensions of and constraints facing the national economy, on international comparisons, and on the international context of policy choice and institutional change.
Programme Directors are given in brackets.
International macroeconomics (Dr C Bliss, Nuffield College, Oxford and Professor D Currie, Queen Mary College, London): economic interdependence and macroeconomic policy coordination (or an international system which permits markets to do the job); policy design in an open economy (credibility, precommitment, time-consistency); sovereign borrowing and international debt; exchange rate systems and currency blocs; the efficiency of international capital markets; causes and consequences of exchange rate misalignments; recent economic history in the open economy context.
International trade (Professors J P Neary, University College, Dublin, and A Smith, Sussex): structural change and shifts in comparative advantage; natural resources and the macroeconomy; imperfect competition, industrial policy, and trade; customs unions in theory and practice; the relationship between internal and external trade patterns of the EEC; North-South models; international migration of labour; trade and industrial structure in the 1930s; the political economy of protectionism.
Developments in applied economic theory and econometrics (Professor P Dasgupta, St John's College, Cambridge; with Associate Directors, Professors R Blundell, University College, London, and
S Schaefer, London Business School): technological diffusion and technology policy; international comparisons of company finance, profitability, and investment behaviour; the changing structure of financial institutions and the functioning of capital markets; international comparisons of tax reforms and labour market behaviour; empirical models of disequilibria and asymmetric information; analysis of methods of evaluation of econometric models and policy simulations on them.
Human resources since 1900 (Professor R Floud, Birkbeck College, London): ageing and its implications for savings, pensions, housing, health care and education; health, morbidity and productivity; secular changes in the structure of the labour force and technological change, unemployment, training, and labour mobility; economic influences on and effects of family formation and the size and structure of the population; historical perspectives on the operation of labour markets; long-run problems of the welfare state.
Publications
A major objective of the Centre is the effective dissemination of research results.
The publication programme stresses an efficiently produced, widely circulated Discussion Paper series and a bi-monthly Bulletin.
The Bulletin is circulated to four thousand members of the academic, business and government policy communities worldwide.
It contains reports of conferences, workshops and lunchtime meetings; summarises all CEPR Discussion Papers and publicises the activities of the Centre and its Research Programmes.
The Discussion Paper Series is intended to make research results available to economists and policy-makers quickly, so as to encourage discussion of the papers and timely application of the analyses and results they contain.
Each Discussion Paper is prefaced by a non-technical summary which communicates its essential findings to those who are not specialists in the field.
One hundred Discussion Papers have appeared as of April 1986.
The volume of papers and proceedings of the June 1984 joint CEPR-NBER conference on the international coordination of economic policy was published by Cambridge University Press in March 1985.
Basil Blackwell will publish in March 1986 the papers and proceedings of the June 1985 conference on ‘Natural Resources and the Macroeconomy’.
The Centre has also launched a new European journal, Economic Policy, in collaboration with the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.
The journal will contain non-technical surveys by leading economists of topical policy issues.
The first issue of Economic Policy appeared in November 1985.
Meetings
The meetings programme includes small workshops bringing together academics with government and private sector economists; lunchtime discussion meetings at which Research Fellows speak on policy-relevant topics, with audiences from Whitehall, Westminster, business and the academic community; academic workshops, seminars, colloquia and conferences; and periodic meetings of the Research Fellows in each programme to discuss and organise research and to plan new research initiatives.

The distinguishing feature of the model is its concern with the secular development of the economy rather than its cyclical or short-term development.
The majority of UK models are ‘demand-side’ models in the sense that the evolution of the economy largely reflects the behaviour of aggregate demand.
Aggregate supply is either assumed to be time-trended or represented in some other naive fashion.
It is perhaps partly for this reason that these models have been largely concerned with the short term economic outlook ie over a horizon of up to three years.
They assume implicitly that over this short-term horizon the supply side will be approximately constant.
Likewise they implicitly assume that over the medium-term (3-10 years), the supply side cannot be assumed to be constant.
In contrast the approach here is to embed aggregate supply as well as the determination of aggregate demand within a broadly neoclassical framework.
Correspondingly, its projection horizon would be 3-10 years although it will necessarily project short-term developments too.
The model does not postulate trend growth rates or naive supply specifications.
Instead a full specification of aggregate supply is proposed in which ‘natural’ rates either in terms of levels or rates of growth are endogenous.
In this respect the model does not compete with most existing models.
On the contrary it is complementary to them in the sense that its comparative advantage rests with analyses of secular economic developments whereas the existing models' comparative advantage rests with the short-term developments.

This research project assesses the response of the English universities to demands generated between 1800 and 1920 by rapid social, economic and intellectual change.
Its aim is twofold.
First, to analyse the impact of socio-economic and intellectual change on ideas about the nature, scope and purpose of English universities.
And secondly, to explain the effect of these ideas on provision for, access to, and the content of higher education.
Under this second head the project seeks to identify the criteria by which the universities determined it appropriate to respond positively to pressures for change, and then further to define the limits within which choices about the practical nature of that response were effectively constrained.
This research project follows up and expands on a series of points made in the author's PhD thesis, History as a Discipline in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge 1848-1914 (Cambridge, 1983) and is based primarily on archival research.

This project continues the work that has been in progress at the London Business School since 1965.
The core is represented by the development of a large scale quarterly econometric model to explain the behaviour of the UK economy.
There is also a linked model of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies.
The LBS model started as a member of the traditional group of ‘Keynesian’ models in which movements in output were largely explained by movements in demand.
In response to economic events and to developments in economic analysis, it has moved, as have other models, to take specific account of financial flows, of monetary developments and of exchange rate changes.
The debate about expectations formation has diverted attention from more fundamental issues in economics, such as the degree of market clearing, the degree of substitutability between assets, etc.
The aim is thus to re-examine traditional questions of macroeconomics within a more reasonable specification of intertemporal optimisation.
Asset markets provide a convenient framework for testing many hypotheses about expectations formation.
The market clearing paradigm is reasonably robust and the Rational Expectations assumption is here most plausible.
Among the projects currently being undertaken are:
1.
The term structure of interest rates
Work by Shaffer (1981) confirms the importance of differential tax treatment of coupon dividends and capital gains.
Work by Shiller (1979) claims to find against the Efficient Markets hypothesis in USA and UK bond markets.
Recognition of tax effects meets part of Shiller's objection but also important is the existence of risk premia which may be modelled.
2.
Floating exchange rate determination
The determination of floating exchange rates is still the subject of considerable controversy but little confidence.
Although the current version of the LBS model places considerable weight on relative money supplies, and implicitly on purchasing power parity, current research is based on two propositions which are widely accepted in North America:
(i)
Given the immense volume of portfolio funds available, and relative mobility between countries, the day to day movements of exchange rates are primarily a capital account phenomenon, and consequently
(ii)
while purchasing power parity may hold in the long run if real shocks are unimportant, in the short run the exchange rate is not caused by PPP considerations; rather, with the exchange rate clearing the asset markets, variations in international competitiveness lead to equilibrating changes in the size of the traded goods sector.
For example, manufacturing industry in the UK was severely hit by the real appreciation of sterling up to mid 1980.
The project will therefore investigate more closely the following propositions:
(i)
Can the (relatively small) deviations from uncovered interest parity — the implication of Rational Expectations in a world where international assets are perfect substitutes — be explained primarily by variations in risk premia?
(ii)
Even if short-term exchange rate variation is induced by asset considerations, current account forces may affect exchange rates through several channels.
3.
Consumption functions
It is unclear what the relation of error correction models is to models which explain revision of behaviour as responses to new information.
The consumption function is an ideal testbed for a general methodological investigation of error correction mechanisms, the design of economic policy, crowding out and aggregate supply.
4.
Error correction and expectations revision
Theoretical research is needed on methodology questions within several simple models.
5.
Further investigation of error correction mechanisms
The project is investigating an idea and an application.
The idea is that by estimating a general correction mechanism and investigating its stability properties it may be possible to bring to bear an additional set of criteria in deciding whether agnostically estimated dynamic specifications are economically reasonable.
Responses which allow a steady state solution but do not allow convergence to that solution might be considered implausible and certainly deserve examination and further study.
6.
The design of economic policy
Research is planned on the implications of optimal control theory for the design of economic policy.
This has two aspects.
It has been recognised that agents may revise their behaviour when the nature of policy is changed.
Equations which have insufficient microeconomic foundations may not be truly structural in the sense that their specification remains invariant over a wide range of interesting developments of the economy.
By solving individual optimisation problems it may be possible to predict the way in which behaviour changes when policy is altered.
Optimal control theory, being a technique for intertemporal optimisation, may allow this idea to become operational.
If policy can have effects, modelling the government sector requires us to formulate their optimisation problem also.
Recent developments on policy optimisation suggest that it may be optimal for the government to plan policy U-turns deliberately in such a setting.
Whilst it is not possible to fool the private sector repeatedly, issues of credibility and the extent of discretion are important.
7.
Crowding out
Crowding out forms an important argument in the monetarist armoury.
Crowding out may be of two varieties: either the effect of changes in government spending are immediately and completely offset by opposite changes in other components of aggregate demand, or aggregated demand is in principle increased but immediately is frustrated by supply constraints.
8.
Aggregate supply
This is the most important research area of all.
Conventional econometric models typically treat aggregate supply only scantily.
For example:
(i)
Output is treated as demand determined;
(ii)
Prices therefore play no explicit role in reconciling planned supply and planned demand;
(iii)
Employment is demand determined;
(iv)
Given huge simplifications about labour supply, unemployment is essentially demand determined also;
(v)
Inventories and investment in new capital goods are treated by flexible accelerator processes from the demand side but play little role in supply;
(vi)
Accounts of wage and price determination are unconvincing.
Partly exempt from these criticisms are Natural Rate Models which have drawn attention to the limitations of existing models, both by emphasising the constraints imposed by production inputs and by emphasising the crucial role of expectations.
Therefore the aim is to develop a mainstream model which comprehensively addresses aggregate supply.
Production, inventory and labour requirements must be planned simultaneously.
Labour supply must be separately but not scantily modelled.
All these decisions are intertemporal and require explicit models of expectations formation.
Finally, it must be recognised that adjustment may be less than instantaneous, both because production processes take time and because the presence of transactions costs and other risks leads to a world in which contracts exist and expectational errors have real effects.
It is hoped that study of supply side aspects of macro-economic behaviour would increase the relevance of the model to the researchers' studies of problems which are at the moment ill-fitted to discuss.
They include rising unemployment, the decline of manufacturing employment and the rise in import penetration.
Some ad hoc studies of these problems have been made ‘off the model’ but it is not possible to tell, from the model, whether these developments are inevitable, optimal, arise from some readily-changed market impediment, or are undesirable and remediable by drastic changes to policy.
It is essential to understand whether, and on what time scale, market adjustments can be effective.

The Centre's major current research is on unemployment, asking why the level of unemployment has been so high, and what can be done about it.
Since wage pressure is the main factor impeding the reduction of unemployment much work has been done on the factors affecting this.
It has been shown, for example, that long-term unemployment does little to reduce wage pressure.
Currently the Centre is studying wage determination at a more micro level.
Other work is concerned with the relation of unemployment and vacancies, and the evidence which this throws on the intensity of search among the unemployed.
Work is also concerned with the question of capital shortage, technology and unemployment.
A second major area of work is profit-sharing.
The Centre has been looking at the productivity record of profit-sharing and non-profit-sharing firms, and the extent to which Japanese experience supports the idea that profit-sharing is a defence against stagflation.
The Centre is also estimating a small macro-model of the British Economy, and at a wider level studying the problem of international economic cooperation designed to raise employment.
The 14 senior staff of the Centre are mostly members of the LSE Economics Department.
There are four full-time Research Officers and the rest of the work is done by 13 research assistants, some of whom are part-time and most of whom are studying for PhDs.
The Centre has a distinguished stream of resident visitors from the USA and runs an annual conference whose proceedings are published.
This year's conference is on the performance of the British economy.
The Centre runs a weekly seminar on unemployment, which provides a major forum for academics and civil servants concerned with this problem.
In the last academic year it published 23 major articles, and produced 26 papers in its Discussion Paper series.
The rise in British and European unemployment
Investigators: R Jackman, R Layard and S J Nickell
Following a recent conference, the investigators are initiating a programme on European unemployment coordinated by R Layard and J Dreze (from Louvain).
This will involve researchers from each of ten countries, including the US.
Unemployment and vacancy flows
Investigator: C Pissarides
Wages, unions and productivity Investigators: C Bean, D Metcalf, J Moore and A Oswald
A key problem is why, even when unemployment is high, wage inflation does not fall.
This requires the investigators to model carefully how wages are determined.
In some cases the initiative is with firms; and in others unions play an important role.
The investigators are embarking on a series of related micro studies of wages at plant level — taking some (small) firms where bargaining is weak or absent, and others where it is dominant.
In bargaining situations a key issue is the extent to which employment is covered in the bargain.
Profit-sharing
Investigators: S Estrin and S Wadhwani
Technology and employment
Investigators: S J Nickell, S Wadhwani, M Wall, C Pissarides and A Bowen
The investigators are studying how technical change affects employment, using plant-level data and industry time-series.
This shall also study the effect of technology on the demand for skills.
Small macro-model
Investigators: C Bean and E Dinenis
The investigators are developing a small macro-model of the UK economy with about twenty behavioural equations.
This should make it possible to see at last what are the key influences when supply as well as demand-side elements have been included.
International economic cooperation
Investigators: F van der Ploeg, O Attanasio and P Manasse
In a world of integrated capital markets, countries are often unwilling to reflate on their own, when they might be willing to reflate in concert.
To study this problem, the investigators have first to develop small models for a small number of key countries, and then to simulate different strategies with which they might or might not manage to cooperate.

Unemployment in the last hundred years

In recent years, defence spending has risen significantly both in industrialised countries and in less developed economies.
At the same time, there has been a rapid growth in arms trade.
In addition, weapons transfers have ceased to be financed by military aid packages and have increasingly become commercial transactions to provide hard currency revenue to suppliers.
This research studies the international economic dimensions of military expenditures and arms transfers.
Econometric analysis is used to study the behaviour in these relationships and test some of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the arms trade, as well as the open economy implications of arms exports and imports.
This quantitative work is supplemented by case studies of UK armaments exports and specific developing country recipients.
The research sheds some light on both the causes and consequences of the arms trade, and contributes to the construction of a comprehensive quantitative picture of the international aspects of military expenditure.

The Centre for Science, Technology and Energy Policy was established at the Science Policy Research Unit of the University of Sussex on the 1 October 1984.
The centre is run as an integrated research programme within SPRU's broader research activities in the areas of industrial innovation and energy.
The objective of the research programme is to identify and explain the nature, determinants and economic impact of technical change in the UK and, in particular, the impact on
(i)
international patterns of trade and growth;
(ii)
structural adjustment, including firms' strategies and industrial structure; and
(iii)
the level and composition of energy supply and demand.
One common theme is to better understand the preconditions and effects of the diffusion of electronics based production technology on the structure and competitiveness of UK industry and or energy supply and demand.
So far the Centre comprises a further seven full time research staff, two part time research staff and three other staff with permanent appointments who will conduct their research within the Centre.
The research on energy forms an integral part of an ongoing programme of research also supported by a club of sponsors from the energy industries.
Research on innovation will be conducted in parallel with a three year programme on Design, Innovation Management and Corporate Strategy led by Dr R Rothwell and funded by the Leverhulme Trust and SPRU's participation in the second phase of the Future of the Automobile Programme organised by the Centre for Technology, Policy and Industrial Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA.
The main focus of the work in the energy area is into the determinants of energy demand in the longer term (including the effects of price, technical change and structural adjustment), the technological and economical assessment of alternative energy production systems, and the impact of new electronics related technologies on energy consumption and production.
Within the energy area work is underway on the institutional aspects of nuclear power, nuclear power economics and technology and energy systems planning (G MacKerron and S Thomas), the long run marginal costs of gas (J Chesshire), a fuel substitution model of the industrial steam raising market (J Skea), energy technology and third world development (J Chesshire and J Surrey) and the energy implications of information technology (W Walker).
New projects are beginning into the industrial steam coal market (G MacKerron), power station fuels (S Thomas), policy options for reducing acid rain (J Skea) and a review of trends in energy demand (J Chesshire and J Surrey).
In the innovation area attention is being devoted to developing and elaborating the evolutionary theories of technical change and economical development deriving from the work of Schumpeter, Nelson and Winter and others.
This theoretical framework opens up the possibility of analysing the process of technical change in a dynamic disequilibrium context and of integrating work in economics, management and technology.
Empirical work will be directed towards operationalising these theories and developing new measures of the rate, direction and distribution of innovative activities.
In the early years of the DRG four major avenues of research will be pursued which will be drawn together thereafter.
The first major theme is the effects of industrial innovation and diffusion on international patterns of trade and growth, including the continuing development of new databases on technological activities, comparisons of innovative activity in different countries and its impact on national economic performance and the economics of innovation and international trade (G Dosi, K Pavitt, L Soete and P Patel).
The second theme is the effects of industrial innovation and diffusion on structural change, including sectoral patterns of technical change and intersectoral flows of technology (K Pavitt and M Robson) and technological trajectories, productivity and sectoral interdependence (N Clark and N von Tunzelman).
The third theme is innovation, diffusion, firm behaviour and performance, including the size distribution of innovating firms in the UK and abroad and technology, corporate strategy and diversification (P Patel, K Pavitt, M Robson and J Townsend).
The fourth theme is the diffusion and adoption of new fundamental technologies in the automobile and energy industries (D Jones and W Walker).

The Technical Change Centre — a private company with charitable status — was established in 1981 by the Leverhulme Trust, the Science and Engineering Research Council and the ESRC, to conduct research into the choice, management and acceptability of technical change relevant to the advancement of the national economy.
Apart from the Director and Deputy Director, there are two Assistant Directors and 19 other full-time and 5 part-time research staff as well as consultants appointed to assist with commissioned projects.
Most of the Centre's work on the choice of technical change has consisted, at the request of SERC, of appraisals of that Council's programmes for the support of research in science and engineering.
Appraisals of their Specially Promoted Programmes, Co-operative Research Grants and Teaching Companies Schemes, the Integrated Graduate Development Scheme, and the balance between academic research and industrial research on materials technology have been completed, as well as an assessment of the effectiveness of the Council's efforts to transfer knowledge of the results of its research projects to industry.
Estimates of the value to the individuals, employers and the academics of the PhD work and the PhD award in the careers of scientists and engineers, and of the significance to the economy of research supported by the Council's Engineering Board, were completed in 1985.
A report on the principal conclusions to be drawn from the appraisals of the many SERC schemes designed to make its sponsored research more relevant to Britain's economic problems was also completed in 1985.
Work on more general aspects of science and technology policy has included completed studies of the ways in which the Japanese Government chooses and administers its ‘next generation base technologies development programme 1981-1991’ and the responses of industrial firms to their Government's ‘seeds and needs’approach.
A first report on the direct and indirect contributions of universities and polytechnics to innovations in the production of goods and services, and possible changes in the balance of these contributions in high-technology activities, was completed in 1985, and a more extensive report, including a model of what it is reasonable to expect from higher education, will be completed in 1986.
Work on the management of technical change includes reports on the coal industry, the steel industry, the machine tool, telephone subscriber equipment and food and drink process equipment industries (in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the USA, and Japan as well as in Britain), the development of cable networks, and the uses of information technology in the insurance industry, the accountancy profession and local government.
The results of a study commissioned by MAFF, AFRC and SERC on the management of technical change in the food processing industry was also completed.
A general appraisal of IT in the service industries and the testing of a reverse product cycle hypothesis for services will be completed in 1986.
Detailed studies of the impact of microprocessor-based process control systems in the process industries on management processes and labour skills were published early in 1985, and action research in this broad field is continuing, as well as work on the diffusion of new working practices.
Research on the impact of the types of employment, and of management/worker relationships, on responsiveness to technical change is also continuing.
A project on technical change and subcontracting in the UK and Japan has started.
Reports on the Centre's work on the acceptability of technical change were completed in 1985.
One report is a series of essays in a common framework by national experts; and the second is a more detailed examination of public attitudes to technical change in Britain with comparative material on France, Germany and Japan.
A third volume which brings into account the complementary projects in Germany and France will be completed in 1986.
Commissioned work adds to the variety of the Centre's projects.
In 1982, the British Library commissioned a study of ‘information demand and supply in British industry’ and following the completion and publication of this report, BL commissioned a further study of the prospective impact of technical change on the demands for information services.
The report on that project was completed early in 1985.
In 1984, the Manpower Services Commission commissioned a study of ‘the effectiveness of the Youth Training Scheme in overcoming skill shortages’.
Part of this study has been subcontracted to project teams in the Universities of Glasgow, Manchester, Reading and London.
The first survey has now been completed, a second survey is underway, and a report on the whole project will be made in 1986.
Two projects commissioned by the European Commission — the competitiveness of the Community's ‘tradeable service sector’ relative to Japan and the USA, and the ‘identification of the technical devices that will lead to new service activities in the next 10-15 years and the role which these new services might play in European society’— were completed in 1985.
Another EC project — on the availability of highly qualified people for the development of IT in the EC — has started; also an Anglo-German Foundation project on technology transfer in the UK and Germany.
The UN University commissioned modelling work on the interaction between food and energy, and this work based on the SARUM global model was completed in 1984.
The National Computing Centre commissioned a survey of assessment of the impacts of office technology on organisational structures and relationships, and that work was completed in 1985.
Commissions from the OECD, ILO and the UN Commission for Europe on technology diffusion and employment have also extended the number and range of the Centre's research programmes.
Close attention is given to the effective dissemination of the results of work carried out by the Centre.
In addition to the publication of reports, seminars and workshops are held at which relevant members of industry, research organisations and the civil service are given an opportunity to discuss and make critical and constructive comment on draft reports or hear the recommendations and final results of research.
In 1985 there were large seminars or workshops on the impact of microprocessors on employment, on telecommunications, the process-equipment industries, the food processing industry, the management of technical change in Japan, the prospective developments in medicial technologies, a large number on changing skill requirements, co-operation in pre-competitive R&D, the future of the UK steel industry, and on the potential impact of technical change on the employability of the less able.

The programme involves research at both the national and local levels of economies in developing countries.
At the national level, the research involves the application of modern theories of public finance to economic problems faced by India, Pakistan and Mexico.
Governments in developing countries in general have faced particularly severe revenue constraints in the 1970s, and for many these are likely to be even more acute during this decade.
Governments have consequently come under increasing pressure to increase their domestic resources, and this usually involves raising public revenue.
At the same time, governments have views on social objectives and on the level and extent of public production.
The problem is to raise additional income in a manner consistent with the government's social objectives — with respect to income distribution, for example— as well as with planned levels of production, investment and public expenditure.
The research in India involves work on direct taxation, using consumer expenditure surveys to look at household budget characteristics, public sector and industrial costs and prices, and the relation between taxation and agriculture.
This work will be extended and applied to Pakistan and Mexico.
In addition to the identification of specific fiscal problems faced by each of the three countries, the research will be able to highlight the similarities and contrasts in the governments' approaches to taxation problems.
As well as work at the national level, the programme also involves detailed research on the economy of one Indian village, Balanpur.
This project represents a continuation of work carried out by the University of New Delhi in 1958 and by Professor Stern and his colleagues in 1975, and will permit close quantitative analysis of a quarter of a century of agrarian change.
The study of the village economy will include aspects such as the functioning of village markets, tenancy patterns, the distribution of assets and incomes, cropping patterns and the effects of population increase and education.

The terms of reference of the Northern Ireland Panel were to commission a programme of research on Northern Ireland within a budget of £350,000 (1980 Survey Prices); to consider how the social science research capacity for work on this area, particularly within Northern Ireland, might be enhanced in the commission of that programme; to commission a register of recent and current research on Northern Ireland; to liaise with the Northern Ireland Office and other relevant agencies with research requirements; to establish links with relevant agencies with research requirements; to establish links with relevant researchers in Great Britain and other countries with a view to the possibility of setting up comparative studies; and to advise researchers in Northern Ireland, who wish to seek finance from the ESRC general research funds or from other agencies.
Although the research supported was not limited by a theme, the issue of employment, unemployment and the operation of labour markets was seen as central to the research development.
The majority of the contracts have been awarded to Northern Ireland institutions and where they have been with other institutions it has been the policy of the Panel to encourage the employment of junior Northern Ireland based researchers on the projects.
The projects deriving from the first phase of the research programme cover topics like small firms, unemployment, career education in, and further education beyond, school, the agricultural sector in the economy, housing and the labour market.
In January 1984, the Chairman of the ESRC visited Belfast and announced that a further £480,000 was to be committed for a second phase of the programme.
Projects in this phase included studies of housing policy, social services and welfare, youth work provision and agricultural marketing.
Part of the budget was earmarked for the establishment of a new Economic Research Centre in Northern Ireland, developed in co-operation with the Northern Ireland Office and the private sector subscribers, which was launched in 1985 (see page 9).
The Northern Ireland Panel was dissolved in December 1984 after making arrangements for the evaluation and dissemination phase of the research programme.

The Research Unit in Health and Behavioural Change was established following the recommendations of a working party of the Scottish Health Services Research Committee in January 1981.
The Unit is sponsored by the Scottish Home and Health Department, the Scottish Health Education Group and the Economic and Social Research Council and commenced operation when the Director took up post in September 1983.
The ‘core’ staff consists of the Director, a Senior Research Fellow (Dr Sonja Hunt, June 1984) and four Research Fellows (Dr Claudia Martin, February 1985: Dr Kathryn Backett, and Dr Erio Ziglio, September 1985: Dr Candace Currie, November 1985).
Research Concerns: A broadly-based programme of research, which focuses on three specific areas, has been developed:
(1)
The monitoring of health-related behaviour in Scotland and, in particular, change in those behaviours and their diffusion over time;
(2)
The articulation of the role of social factors in behavioural change related to health and illness.
This ‘area’ includes applications of research findings in community-based intervention programmes;
(3)
The analysis of health promotion policies and their impact on health related behaviour.
These three areas obviously overlap, but have in common a fundamental concern with methodological issues and the development and testing of theories of health-related behavioural change.
Moreover, projects are not necessarily confined to one ‘area’.
The Unit also endeavours to encourage collaborative research and to act as a source of advice for studies carried out by other organisations.
Research Projects: A number of studies have already been completed, others are underway and a number are in preparatory phases.
These projects include:
(1)
A large-scale investigation of health behaviour in Scotland, which is concentrating, initially, on health-related behaviour in a middle aged sample, has recently commenced.
This will be followed by studies of health behaviour in schoolchildren and in the elderly.
The long-term goals of this programme of research are to establish baseline data against which changes in behaviour can be assessed, to develop theories of behavioural change, to identify those behavioural processes which may serve as targets for intervention and to act as a resource for evaluating health education initiatives.
(2)
A one-year study funded by the ESRC ‘A Behavioural Change Indicator’ is examining the antecedents and correlates of behavioural change in natural settings.
This material will be used to develop a standardised instrument for the measurement and prediction of changes in health-related behaviours.
(This study is being carried out by David McQueen and Marion Macleod).
(3)
A dietary survey (concentrating on fibre intake) has been completed.
A number of issues were explored in this study which also included an experimental investigation of processes of dietary change.
(4)
The Unit is currently carrying out research into the role of health promotion policy both within the Scottish context and cross-nationally.
Studies in this area include an analysis of health promotion in three North European countries.
(5)
A ‘health’ profile of the Lothian Region, which is using routinely collected data to compare small area variations, is being compiled.
In addition to providing health information about the Region, this material will also be used in the selection of sampling points for other studies carried out in the Unit.
(6)
Studies which are being prepared include: a qualitative investigation of family interaction and the negotiation of beliefs and ideas about health and illness, and a study of social stress and alcohol use and abuse in women.
(7)
The Unit has become a centre for collaborative research; projects in which members of staff have played a major role include: the perceived health of attenders and non-attenders at a breast screening clinic, an evaluation of the Edinburgh Women's Health Shop, an evaluation of the ‘Drinkwise’ project, a study of smoking and drinking among student nurses, and the evaluation of the Lothian Mobile Mammography Project.
The Edinburgh Health Research Group — a fortnightly seminar series — is now organised by the RUHBC.

The Thomas Coram Research Unit is part of the University of London Institute of Education.
Funding comes from a number of sources, of which DHSS, the ESRC and the UGC are the largest.
The Unit undertakes policy-orientated research concerned with family health, with the education and development of children, and with the services provided for them and their families.
The Unit has 26 academic staff and takes full-time PhD students.
Conferences and seminars for researchers and practitioners are organised each year.
The Designated Research Centre within the Unit is comprised of three projects concerned with education and family health.
The contribution of parents and teachers to children's achievement in the infant school
This project is concerned with children's learning experiences at home and at school both before and throughout the infant school.
The aim is to relate their educational achievements to their experiences at school and to their parents' help at home.
The sample is composed of the September 1982 entrants to reception classes in 33 ILEA infant schools in multi-racial areas.
It is balanced for ethnicity and sex, the two major groups being children of white indigenous parents, and children of black parents of West Indian Origin.
The children have been followed through infant school.
The design involves repeated testing of the extent of the children's literacy and numeracy, and classroom observation of the children.
These measures are related to information from repeated interviews with parents and teachers.
The interviews with the parents are concerned with collecting demographic data, and with obtaining a detailed account of parental educational help at home.
They are also concerned with the parents' attitude to the school and the teachers, their ideas about the causes of educational achievement, and their contacts with the school.
The interviews with the class teachers centre on their parent involvement and multi-cultural practices and their assessments of the children's behaviour and achievement.
The level of work the children are introduced to is also being assessed.
Data collection for the Infant School project is now complete, and the process of analysis and writing up is now under way.
Perspectives on child-rearing: parents and health visitors
This project started in June 1985.
It is a development of a previous DRC study of health-related child-rearing beliefs and practices among a sample of white, UK-born mothers (Caring for the Health of Young Children, 1981-1984).
The study described similarities and differences in beliefs and practices of mothers of different social class, and considered material and behavioural explanations for them.
The present project focuses on parental and health visitor perspectives on health-related child-rearing, on health visiting, and on the preventive child health services.
The aim of the study is to investigate the extent to which parents and health visitors share common views on these topics.
It is proposed to focus on a sample of parents drawn from a multi-ethnic area, and on a sample of health visitors working in the area.
The policy implications of the study are likely to be in the general area of improving knowledge among and communication between parents and professionals.
It is hoped that the data will help those who plan and provide health services, including health visiting services, for children and their parents in a multi-ethnic society.
Patterns of health and health care in parents of young children
Parental health status is a potentially important influence on childcare and development.
Responsibility for children also has an impact on parental health and use of health services.
The aim of this three-year project is to initiate an investigation of this two-way relationship between the health of parents and the care and welfare of the children.
A second aim is to examine some of the well-established gender differences in health status and health service use by locating these within the context of domestic responsibility.
The project has a number of separate but related dimensions.
First, secondary analysis of General Household Survey data and where appropriate of data from TCRU research projects is being undertaken.
These analyses should provide a base-line description of patterns of health status and health care use within families/
households of different types in different social and economic circumstances.
Second, a pilot study of a small number of households will be undertaken.
The objectives will be to explore in detail some of the key concepts in this field, notably work, parenthood, and health and consider the most appropriate way of operationalising and measuring them.
Together these two strategies will establish some of the basic parameters of the relationship between parental health and the care and development of young children and contribute to the development and testing of appropriate outcome measures.

The SPSG was set up on 1 September 1986 to promote studies related to science policy in the United Kingdom.
Its aim is to improve policies affecting the R & D system through a better understanding of how this system functions at all levels.
The work of SPSG is monitored through a Programme Advisory Committee which also advises ESRC on the funding of research in science studies and science policy.
SPSG does not itself undertake research: it facilitates, co-ordinates, organises, reviews and disseminates, the research work of others through the organisation of workshops and seminars (particularly bringing researchers and policy-makers together); helping to manage research for customers or ad hoc consortia; evaluating research proposals and completed work and commissioning new work to fill gaps in our knowledge; keeping UK policy makers aware of the results of research, whether originating in the UK or overseas; and monitoring and advising on the training of science policy analysts and research administrators.
It is intended to identify specific issues for attention within a comprehensive national agenda of issues of science and technology policy thought likely to be prominent over the next 10-15 years.
This developing agenda, in broad outline, covers economic and industrial issues of science policy in an international context; issues of science policy in an international context; modelling the research process and finding means of monitoring its development and change; and management of the R & D process in the various sectors and levels of the system.

The intention is to revalue Britain's capital exports (portfolio investment) from 1870 to 1914.
It follows from an article published early in 1980 when British portfolio investment by 1870 was down valued by up to 100 per cent D C M Platt ‘British Portfolio Investment Overseas before 1870: Some Doubts’, Economic History Review, 2nd series XXXIII: 1 (February 1980), 1-163/8.
The evidence for this article was of a particular kind, and the proposal is to apply the same methods to the subsequent period, taking the whole revaluation as far as the First World War.
The sources will therefore be the financial columns of the public press, the financial press itself, the Stock Exchange Yearbook and similar publications (Burdett, Herapath), income tax returns, investors' guides, handbooks, and almanacks.
Experience for the period before 1870 suggests that the usual estimates for Britain's overseas investment before 1914 are heavily inflated, possibly by as much as one-third.
The implications are considerable, both to the Marxist-Leninist historiographical tradition and to professional economic historians.

Governments subsidize export credit in various ways.
Among the most important are official guarantees and below-market interest rates.
The subsidy implicit in official guarantees has received very little attention.
Interest-rate subsidies have attracted more notice, but the comparative cost of credits in different currencies has not been much explored.
These two areas are the subject of this research.
The research seeks to assess how much of the business guaranteed by government export credit agencies would be declined by the private sector or accepted only at a higher price.
Such business must carry a subsidy of some sort and the research seeks to evaluate it.
The second part of the research examines differences in costs of commercial loans and official export credits in different currencies; and considers the theoretical and empirical basis for a system of differentiated minimum rates.
The countries covered are France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Data are being gathered from published sources and from interviews with officials, private insurers and commercial bankers.

One of the most notable developments in the Soviet Union, contrary to the confident expectations of Soviet and Western Marxists as well as modernisation theorists, is that rapid socio-economic development in the USSR has not led to any decrease in ethnic attachment among the minority nationalities.
In fact, the opposite has been the case with a trend towards ethnic consolidation.
This needs explanation.
This project tries to offer some answers by looking in depth at the case of the Georgians since 1953 (the death of Stalin).
A study of the national question in Georgia must incorporate an analysis of indigenous social and economic developments (extra-political factors such as urbanisation, demographic changes and industrialisation) as well as government policy implemented by the centre.
The project investigates the impact of Soviet nationality policy on the Georgians and the extent of their assimilation as measured by such factors as Russian-language use, inter-marriage, migration to other parts of the USSR, and loss of identity with national symbols.
The research covers such important events as the 1956 and 1978 demonstrations in Tbilisi, Shevardnadze's campaign against ‘half-baked nationalism’, the growth of ‘dissident nationalism’, the impact of political and economic reforms by the centre, Georgian relations with other Transcaucasian minorities and the indigenisation of the Georgian republic.

The Survey Methods Centre is a division of Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR).
It was established as an ESRC Designated Research Centre, in association with the City University.
Its main object is to undertake research into survey methods and problems.
It also has an education and training programme.
The Centre administers a seminar series sponsored by the ESRC and publishes a newsletter to improve communication among those interested in methodology.
These activities provide a much needed base for unifying survey methodology work in the government, academic, commercial and research institute sectors and for international exchanges.
The research programme is outlined below.
Sample Design
Principal Investigators: Ms J Waterton and Ms D Lievesley
In the sample design programme, the effect on sampling errors of clustering the sample — usually in wards or polling districts — has been examined for different types of questions and for different population subgroups.
There is now a substantial ‘library’ of design effect information for both general population and minority surveys.
The programme has examined the extent to which different variables are sensitive to changes in the level of clustering.
This facilitates imputation where the complex sampling error has not been calculated directly.
At the operational level, the Centre has produced a Manual of Sampling practice, to be published during 1986.
Non response
Principal Investigator: Ms D Lievesley
The programme is aimed at reducing non-response.
Work has concentrated on analysis of two data sets.
The first of these contains details on 61 surveys conducted by SCPR over the past six years: a total of about 3,000 interviewer assignments.
Each interviewer's refusal and non-contact rates were related to interviewer characteristics.
Results show that interviewers who have worked for over five years have lower refusal rates than more recent recruits.
Similarly, attendance at intermediate training school, training in depth-interviewing and employment as a supervisor or pilot interviewer are all related to lower refusal rates, but have no effect upon contact rates.
In contrast, car ownership and willingness to work evenings and weekends are positively related to higher contact rates but have no relationship to refusal rates.
The second data set contains information on all calls on sampled addresses on three national surveys, coded by the time and day of call and the outcome, in order to examine calling patterns and relate these patterns to productivity.
Results from these analyses have been presented at a number of conferences and seminars in the UK and overseas.
They are now being prepared for presentation to the Royal Statistical Society.
Obtaining respondents' co-operation
Principal Investigators: Ms J Morton-Williams and Ms P Young
Part of the non-response programme involves the analysis and evaluation of respondent contacting procedures and survey introductions through the use of doorstep tape recordings.
The work will make a contribution to interviewer training and to social skills analysis, through the identification of more successful interviewer strategies in the face of reluctance.
The results will be presented at the 1986 conference of the Market Research Society and, subsequently, in a paper invited by the Journal of that Society.
Analysis of the interview
Principal Investigators: Dr W Sykes and
Ms J Morton-Williams
This programme of research focuses on the survey interview itself.
It involves the development of a system to facilitate the description and analysis of the interview process.
This has been used to define the interviewer's tasks and what problems arise.
It has also been employed, in conjunction with other research techniques such as the follow up interview, in the identification of survey questions which are problematic for either the interviewer or the respondent.
A paper published in the Journal of the Market Research Society was awarded the MRS Silver medal for the most notable published contribution to market research in the period 1983-1985.
Evaluation of telephone interviewing
Principal Investigators: Dr W Sykes and Professor M Collins
Two experiments with telephone interviewing have been conducted.
The first compared face-to-face interviewing both with telephone interviewing and with a mixed-mode approach.
The second repeated the evaluation of telephone interviewing against face-to-face interviewing and was extended to include an assessment of computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI).
The detailed report on the first experiment is available from SCPR.
A book on the subject has been commissioned for publication in 1987.
Social attitudes panel study
Principal Investigators: Ms D Lievesley and Ms J Waterton
This methodological study investigates the relative strengths and weaknesses of panel and cross-sectional approaches to the measurement of attitude data, using as a vehicle the British Social Attitudes Survey.
This nationwide annual survey collects attitudinal information on a variety of topics including health and welfare, education, housing, morality, economic expectations and political beliefs.
The research aims to examine the effects of attrition and conditioning on the panel, to exploit the analytic advantages of attrition and conditioning on the panel relating to its ability to model dynamic models of human behaviour and attitudes and to investigate the practical aspects of maintaining a panel.
The fourth wave of data collection is now underway.
A number of papers are in preparation, including one to be presented by invitation of the American Statistical Association.

The project makes a detailed comparison of two distinctive regions of Northern Italy, concentrating on economic change and social transformation consequent on that change.
At the same time, it is proposed to assess the degree of correlation between economic and social developments and political evolution.
The project starts from the basic hypothesis that modernisation of agricultural and industrial regions was extremely uneven during the period of time here considered, and that this uneven development may have had important consequences for the development of the internal market for both agricultural and industrial products, even to some degree determining the structure and efficiency of production.
The areas chosen for the case studies — in Lombardy and Emilia — are intended to reflect very different patterns of modernisation; the first, relatively slow and perhaps therefore politically stable; the second, remarkably rapid and perhaps therefore producing class polarisation and a high level of political militance expressed through the passage from socialism to fascism, and then to communism.
All available statistics relating to population, employment, family household structure, and electoral patterns will be gathered for a sample series of municipalities and will then be analysed by computer.

This programme of research is concerned with taxation and social security with particular reference to their effects on incentives and on the distribution of income.
The research is concerned with the long-run impact of government policy, rather than with issues of short-run macro-economic policy.
It seeks to bring both economic theory and empirical techniques to bear on questions critical to the design of policy.
The main basis for the empirical work is information available from the Family Expenditure Survey.
This is being used to investigate the incidence of taxation and benefits at the level of individual households, building on the work already carried out by the Central Statistical Office.
The research examines the response of households to taxation — how it affects decisions to work, spend and save — and the relationship between the personal and company sectors.
The results are being applied to policy issues of current interest, including the reform of taxation and of income maintenance.

The project makes use of previously unpublished data collected each year by the Department of Employment (Economic Development in Northern Ireland) for the New Earnings Survey.
This survey is a comprehensive source of information on various aspects of earnings, including the make-up of earnings (gross, shift, incentive pay, etc), whether the employee was covered by a collective agreement, the occupation of the employee, etc.
It provides a detailed survey of pay, and therefore makes research possible into what determines pay in Northern Ireland.
A similar project covers the New Earnings Survey in Great Britain, and so extensive comparison with other British regions is included in this project.
Specific topics of interest are the impact of collective agreements on pay in Northern Ireland, and the composition of the workforce (ie occupation/industry/sex/part-time or full-time nature of the workforce) and its effect on pay over time.
This project was part of the Northern Ireland initiative,(Award reference A27)

Integrated rural development advocates the promotion of community-led initiatives, geared to the needs of specific target groups in the rural population and as far as possible utilising indigenous resources to meet those needs.
The research aims to examine the relevance of this concept to the future development of two case study areas in Co Fermanagh.
A household questionnaire survey of 100 households (50% sample) will be carried out to establish the social, environmental, and economic needs of these communities; the level of use, awareness and attitudes to existing state aid; the nature and performance of existing businesses; the human and physical resources that are available.
The analysis of these data should be complete by early 1985 and will be followed by a further survey of key informants and the various development agencies in an attempt to identify the type of projects which might be promoted within the framework of an Integrated Rural Development programme.
This project was part of the Northern Ireland initiative (Award reference A27)

The Resource Options Programme is concerned to analyse the scope for and constraints upon ethnicity as a principle of economic organisation and group identity, paying special attention to localism as an alternative principle by which groups may organise or identify for particular purposes.
The Programme will have both a specific and a general relevance to current policy concerns.
On the first count it will explore aspects of the socio-economic organisation of minority groups from the perspective of ordinary life in London.
On the second, it raises the questions: What makes for viability in contemporary urban life?
In what ways, and in terms of which resources, do more or less ‘viable’ areas in the same city differ?
How and how far are differences in the character of local resource systems governed by the local industrial structure?
The Programme will compare two inner London areas in these respects.
Its complement is interdisciplinary: the study will place each field research area in the economic and historical context of its parent borough.
It will comprise a First Stage neighbourhood ethnographic survey and a Second Stage series of case studies of households selected from within each neighbourhood.
In both stages, the Programme aims also to develop research strategies pioneered in the ESRC/
Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations Ethnicity Programme 1975-80.

The June 1982 Versailles Economic Summit concluded that the public acceptance of new technologies is an important element in securing growth and employment.
And yet surprisingly little is known about the factors which make for public acceptance.
In trying to understand this multi-faceted problem, the project has four stages.
First, a study of the general background by way of a literature review and conference on the decline of the British economy since 1870.
The emphasis is on public acceptance of new technologies as a variable in national economic performance.
The policy implications of the many relevant British and foreign studies are also being drawn out.
Secondly, there are a number of ‘cross-cutting’ studies of contemporary aspects of the research which examines the public in three roles: as consumers, producers and voters.
These consider such questions as: post-war product and process innovations, the income-leisure trade-off, management and trade union attitudes, regulatory mechanisms and public inquiries, consumer and public attitude surveys.
These studies also focus on the influence of particular institutions such as the British education system.
Thirdly, there are case-studies on particular industries or technologies to throw light on the generation, adoption, diffusion and success in exploiting new technologies.
These include such innovations as new technology in the newspaper industry, robots, the diffusion of CAD/CAM systems, high-speed trains, home and business computers, and video cassettes.
Fourthly, there is an attitude survey of a national sample of the general public to discover current attitudes to new technologies.
To bring in the international comparative aspects of the project, foreign participation is being sought at all stages — particularly for the case-studies and attitude survey where participation is likely from France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and possibly Italy and Canada.
Additionally, Japanese perspectives are being added.
This award is part of the Public acceptance of new technologies initiative (award reference number A/16/25/0000)

A vast number of debt summonses are issued in the county courts each year leading to judgements which are enforced in various ways.
Nevertheless very little is known about the social and economic significance of different enforcement methods, the direct and indirect expense of the enforcement machinery and the impact of different enforcement procedures on debtors and their families.
This research is intended to explore these matters through a study of the enforcement machinery of a county court and an examination of social and economic consequences of this machinery for creditors and debtors involved with it.
The research project seeks also to compare court officials', creditors' and debtors' perceptions of the enforcement system itself and to contribute towards sociological understanding of the nature of enforcement processes as an aspect of the legal system neglected in previous socio-legal research.
The findings of the study should therefore have both theoretical relevance for the sociology of law and practical significance for consideration of possible reforms of enforcement procedures.

Scotland and Ireland are two societies which initially had much in common but whose fortunes increasingly diverged.
Both societies are deeply influenced by their history and by their perception of that history.
This conference, the fourth in a series exploring parallels and contrasts in development, will focus on the changing response to economic, social and political crisis, and on the interaction of religious, class and cultural identities.
The divergence of the two societies became apparent in the late 18th century, but appears to have accelerated between 1890 and 1914.
During those years, both faced the same general economic and social changes — fluctuations of world trade, changing technology, changes in the nature of work, a demographic transition, the growth of nationalism in Europe and the growth of working class political consciousness and organization — but the outcome on the two societies was very different.
The conference will look closely at the common experience of Scotland and Ireland as peripheral regions and at the nature of their relationships — economic, social and cultural — with the metropolitan centre.
These complex relationships have been central to the fortunes of the two countries over the past three centuries.
They have implications for understanding regional economic and social problems in the twentieth century.
They will be discussed in terms of material resources and economic developments, as well as urban networks, financial relationships and cultural influences.

S F Nadel (1903-1956) was author of five distinguished books and a number of learned papers, and at the height of his career was thought of as one of the rising stars of British social anthropology.
His first major field research was among the Nupe people of Northern Nigeria, and on his second field research period there, 1935-36, he wrote up a work journal which has never been published.
This study aims to produce an edited version of this journal, which will include an essay on the importance of Nadel's Nigerian researches, as a contribution to the main currents of anthropological thought on the state in Africa, and an essay on the strengths and weaknesses of his ethnography in the light of more recent research in the Bida Emirate.
The journal contains material of interest to historians concerned with late colonial Nigeria, and with the developments among the Nupe people and their neighbours at this time; and material which illuminates how one body of anthropological field research was carried out against the background of colonial administration.
Nadel, an Austrian-Jewish emigre, viewed the British colonial administrators with a sometimes caustic eye, and the journal contrasts sharply with the relatively diplomatic comments made in his published work.
It thus contributes something to an understanding of field research in the ‘classic’ period of British functionalism.
The grant will assist the final editing of the journal, and the cross-checking of some of Nadel's local tours and identifications of people and places, which would remain obscure were it not for more recent ethnographic inquiry.
It is hoped that this project will be innovative not only in the material resented and analysed, but as a contribution to new modes of scholarly publication.
We plan to produce a volume of edited journal selections, printed in the normal way, but as part of the book, or as an easily obtainable supplement, we shall make available the full text of the journals, suitably annotated, on floppy diskette.
This service should be of value to Nigeria specialists, who have a strong scholarly interest in the ‘whole text’, but who may not wish to put ‘whole-text’ prices to obtain it.
This will be of particular importance to some younger Nigerian research students, and others.

Evolution of public transport and traffic planning policies in West German cities since 1960 has been subject to continuing scrutiny.
Initial pre-occupations with the ‘Autogerechte Stadt’(car adapted city)— manifest in demolition of historic buildings, street widening and extensive central area parking provisions- have gradually been replaced by more qualitative and environment oriented policies.
Investments in public transport, the de-development of major traffic axes and the implementation of traffic restraint measures are now key instruments of policies which emphasize the importance of tradition and urban conservation.
To date, major public transport and traffic planning investment in West Germany has been geographically concentrated in the major conurbations and city regions, for example Rhine-Ruhr, Rhine-Main, Stuttgart, Hamburg and Munich.
Investments in public transport in these areas have concentrated on expensive high technology systems of rapid rail transit.
However more recently the focus of interest has shifted to the medium and smaller sized urban centres, where historic structures and environmental attractiveness have also been threatened by traffic problems.
For these smaller cities, less expensive and more modestly scaled public transport and traffic restraint policies are more appropriate.
The research programme will therefore investigate the impact of public transport and traffic restraint policies in the medium and smaller sized city.
/Analysis will be undertaken at the ‘macro’(whole city), ‘meso’(city centre, inner city suburbs) and ‘micro’(individual street) levels, noting impacts upon land use, land values and various other socio-economic indicators.

In the last ten years employment in Britain has changed dramatically.
Industry has been restructured, with the loss of many jobs in manufacturing and growth in the service sector.
There have been changes in employment protection and trade union law, and in relevant social security benefits.
‘Flexible’ forms of employment have grown, women have become more active in the labour force, and the effective age of retirement for men has fallen.
Unemployment has reached post-war records, and government schemes for the unemployed have replaced each other at a very fast pace.
Although these changes are well understood in general terms, there is little systematic information at a national level on how they affect the lives of individual workers.
This project aims to map the movements of individuals between employment, unemployment and economic inactivity over the decade 1979-1989, to identify significant trends, and to relate them to wider economic factors and policy developments.
Movements of particular interest will be studied in detail, for example transitions to self-employment and women's returns to employment.
The analysis will be based on data from the government's annual Labour Force Survey.
Subsidiary aims of the research are to explore some of the statistical problems arising form the survey's complex design, and to contribute to research training in the analysis of trend data.

The period since 1979 has been a traumatic one for British trade unionism.
Membership has fallen by more than 3 million or nearly 25 percent, and traditional systems of labour organization and industrial relations have come under considerable pressure.
There is now a widespread view that trade unionism is caught up in a fundamental transformation.
One or two preliminary studies have suggested that these changes are occurring unevenly across the country, but as yet there is little substantive research into this issue, even though it has been stressed as a priority question by the TUC itself.
The central aims of this project, therefore, are
(i)
to determine the scale and nature of geographical changes in trade unionism since the late 1970s;
(ii)
to assess the extent to which this changing geography is related to the uneven impact of economic restructuring and to developments in work practices, industrial relations, and managerial strategy within firms; and
(iii)
to evaluate the likely consequences for regional and local differences in economic and labour market performance.
The study will draw upon various sources of data, including union archives, the WIRS (1980, 1984 and 1990), and new information obtained from nation-wide and locally-based surveys.

The numbers presented in companies' annual financial statements are, in part, the result of accounting policy choices by their managements.
These policy choices can substantially affect the profits declared.
There is some evidence that managements select those choices that best suit their ends.
State-owned enterprises are believed to face pressures to select profit-reducing choices where, for example, price rises are politically sensitive.
However, it may be that once privatised, these pressures are tempered by pressures to show increased profits so as to justify higher dividends and enhance market prices.
This study analyses the accounting policy choices made for selected industries that have been privatised during the 1980s, both before and after privatisation.
The intention is to investigate these choices in their social, political and economic context to discover how different pressures at different times might have influenced them.
The benefits from the research should include:
(a)
a better understanding of the accounting policies of these industries themselves;
(b)
a better understanding of the socio-political pressures within which accounting choices take place; and
(c)
a contribution to the theoretical debates concerning the most fruitful research approach for investigating accounting policy choices.

In the various studies of Zambian leadership two schools of thought have emerged concerning President Kenneth Kaunda.
One, an older school, has seen him as a noble if embattled statesman.
The other sees him as a collaborator with the forces of oppression.
No study has been made to assess the merits of the two competing schools.
The division between two schools of thought is nowhere more apparent than in the field of Zambian foreign policy.
Accordingly, this project intends to investigate Kaunda's foreign policy both before and after Zimbabwe's independence.
Before independence, Zimbabwe competed for and successfully gathered what had been Zambia's crown of regional leadership against South AFrica.
Simultaneously, Zambia's economic position began seriously to worsen.
These two unconnected events were traumatic to Zambian self-confidence and policy.The project has, therefore, two levels of comparison: comparison between two images of Kaunda, each promoted by a separate school; and comparison of Kaunda's foreign policy in the two time periods — before and after 1980.
In addition, the project intends to make use of theoretical materials in conflict analysis and mediation, as well as other academic thought on strategic studies and coercive diplomacy.
These forms of comparison and these theoretical approaches give the project its sub-title, ‘Towards an Intellectual History of Foreign Policy’.

In the mid-1980s, a number of concerns focussed attention on the transfer of land from agriculture to forestry, including surpluses of farm products, falling farm incomes, high rates of wood imports, and damage to wildlife and landscape in rural areas.
The government has introduced several schemes to encourage farmers to plant up land.
In the past, most afforestation has been carried out in the uplands.
Current attention is being given to lowland agriculture, where greater impacts can be expected on farm output and wildlife.
However, the success of recent policy initiatives can only be fully met if farmers find it their own interests to plant up pieces of land in such a way as to achieve both timber production and environmental improvement.
Building on previous modelling work on land allocation for afforestation on upland farms and on the conservation value of farmland in Devon, the research aims to develop a computerised model of lowland farming situations to test out the likely impact of various economic incentives and technical possibilities for farm forestry.
The work will take into account developments in agricultural markets and policies, and will be tested on a number of actual and potential plantings by farmers.

The 1980s have seen a progressing ‘mixing of the economy.
In line with this trend, the 1989 White Paper, ‘Caring for People’ stressed the importance of both informal care and greater provision of care by ‘independent sector’, which includes both private and voluntary organisations.
This project will monitor the development of contracting between three Age Concern Groups and both their local Social Service Department and Health Authorities over a period of three years, with special attention to the effects of the new ‘contracting culture’ on
(a)
the relationship between user and provider and
(b)
the structure, organisation and activities of the voluntary organisations.
The aim of the research is first, to produce models of user/provider relationships vis-a-vis contracting, and second to add to our understanding of the changing nature of voluntary organisations and the problems of managing change within them.

In 1986/87 three government departments (Department of Health, Home Office, Scottish Home and Health Dept) and two research councils (Medical Research Council and Economic and Social Research Council) funded a study of drugs research both in Britain and internationally which aimed to suggest priorities for research and means of effective research co-ordination.
Position papers written for the initiative covered the areas of epidemiology, treatment, services, crime, policy, behaviourial research, the pharmacology and the economics of addiction.
The initiative report and papers, updated to incorporate developments in the intervening two years and in particular the impact of AIDS are being published as a survey of drugs research in the 1980's.

A conference is to be held in April 1989 in Mexico City.
It will draw together planners and urban and regional level geographers, and some other social scientists, to discuss several issues relating to decentralization.
This topic is particularly important in Mexico because of the earthquake which shook the city, and because of the massive size of Mexico City, the world's largest city.
Part of the conference will consider the Mexican problem, from the point of both metropolis and smaller towns; behind this, it is hoped to extract ideas as to how decentralization may be viewed (as social, economic, political or physical process), and what kind of planning if any, is needed to accomplish it.
Recommendations for policy generally in the Third World cities may be forthcoming.

The government in 1989 announced that the professions will no longer be exempt from the law prohibiting restrictive trade practices.
This project focuses on the legal profession with particular reference to the market for conveyancing services in England and Wales.
In 1985 the rules governing the practices of solicitors were amended to allow them to advertise.
In 1987 the para-profession of licensed conveyancer was created removing the legal professors' effective monopoly in this area.
The Lord Chancellor's White Paper of 1989 foreshadows the entry of banks and building societies into this market.
Under this grant data will be collected (using telephone surveys and direct interviews) in 27 geographical locations.
Together with data from an earlier study this will allow an econometric analysis of conveyancing prices and their determinants at each of three stages in the process of introducing more competition into this market.
The project will also seek to examine the differences in the nature of service provided at different fee levels.
The market for conveyancing services provided to commercial firms will also be studied to establish whether it requires the same degree of self regulation as the market for domestic conveyancing.

The persistence of severe and deep-rooted regional imbalances in regional economic and social well-being remains one of the major issues that will shape future public policy developments and their impact in the 1990's.
In particular, Northern Ireland and Scotland have experienced considerable structural and locational disadvantage in the post war period due to industrial restructuring, a lack of inward investment and an inability to generate sufficient indigenous employment.
Both regions have, as a consequence, attracted a considerable degree of public policy assistance at national, regional and local levels.
Measures have included the setting up of regional development agencies, private- public partnership schemes and privately organised enterprise trusts.
Nevertheless, within the context of the United Kingdom, the two regions remain relatively disadvantaged in economic and social terms.
The research proposal involves the organisation of two seminars to bring together researchers in the two regions.
The main purpose of the seminars is to identify the degree to which there is a commonality of process operating in the respective regional economies.
More specifically, the seminars are intended to identify the nature and effectiveness of the public policy response in terms of the broad strategy and detailed instruments used and to debate the alternatives for the 1990s.
The seminars are intended to act as the basis for developing a future programme of collaborative research in the periphery.

A team of researchers at Aberdeen University have received support for a three year study of Scottish soccer fan behaviour.
The study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, will involve observations of fan behaviour at both club and international matches.
The main centres for research purposes are Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dundee.
This project will draw attention to problems in distinguishing ‘committed supporters’ from ‘soccer hooligans’.
It will consider the various inter-relations between perceivedly ‘soccer hooligan’ formations, their fellow supporters, their rivals, and those involved in alternative youth cultures.
Particularly interesting will be how rivalries are both conceived of by fans themselves, and represented in local and national media.
The study will assess the content, function and importance of fanzines for soccer fans, and the extent to which these adequately reflect their relations with, and perceptions of, club directors and soccer authorities.
It will also examine the response of fans to structural and cultural changes in Scottish soccer, following the Taylor report on safety, and leading up to the 1994 World Cup Finals.
The research team has previously received support from Aberdeen University and the Football Trust.

The use of live animals is an integral component of much research in the biological sciences, medicine, veterinary and agricultural science and psychology, in contents ranging from fundamental science to the chemical testing of household products.
The current organisation and management of many areas of scientific activity, and of institutions dependant on such activity, is generally based on two assumptions.
First, in some circumstances and to some degree, the biological similarities between human and non-human animals permit valid extrapolation of research findings from the latter to the former.
Secondly, in some circumstances, it is morally justifiable to use non-human animals in research where the use of humans would not be justifiable.
Both assumptions, and the interpretation of the circumstances in which they are applicable, have long been controversial among scientists and between scientists and their audiences.
Nevertheless, live animal experimentation is deeply embedded in the culture of contemporary biomedical science.
But it is an aspect that appears to be undergoing significant change.
The aim of the project is to contribute to knowledge and understanding of the organisation and management of animal experimentation in Britain, of the changing social.
Legal and economic context in which this takes place and of the impact of these changes on the scientific community as a whole and on the individual laboratory workers' culture and practice.
Information will be collected through three sources:— search of documentary sources; parliamentary papers, scientific journals, advisory body papers etc. — in-depth semi-structured interviews with people involved covering a wide spectrum from scientists publicly active in defence of animal experiments to scientific advisers to anti-vivisection societies, drawing from both the public and private sectors;— observation, visits to laboratories and animal houses of approx 20 research institutions.
The research will contribute substantively and theoretically to several areas within sociology and social policy, including studies of science and medicine, of social movements and cultural change and of the formation and implementation of public policies for science.
The extremely controversial nature of this topic makes such a project of considerable practical as well as theoretical relevance.

Small firms in services form the great majority of small businesses in Britain but surprisingly little research exists on them.
This neglect becomes more serious as services becomes more important in the economy.
A three year programme of four linked projects will investigate small services sector firms in five types of local economy in Britain.
The lead project will interview 350 owner-managers on their managerial strategies and relations with suppliers, customers, banks and others and on their labour problems.
The second project explores the external networks in which the firms participate, interviewing representatives of suppliers, customers, banks, employment agencies and others on their relations with services small firms.
The third project concerns the impact of new technology and relations between technology suppliers and the small firms in the lead project as well as the extent to which owner-managers themselves innovate and Influence new technology.
The final project examines labour relations and labour market influences and will interview over 300 employees at all levels in the lead project firms.
Overall, the programme will produce an in depth picture of how small firms in the services sector in different kinds of localities in Britain function and play their role in the economy.

The Warwick University Vocational Education and Training Forum organised a one day conference on French work in the field of formation/emploi.
VET research in Britain is very fragmented, poorly developed theoretically and often geared to short-term objectives of policy evaluation.
In contrast, in France links have been made between researchers in different disciplines, the work has been more highly developed theoretically and a major critical review of the state of research has been conducted.
All three of the speakers presenting papers had been involved in this review and discussed different aspects in their contributions.
Lucie Tanguy (Groupe de Sociologie du Travail, University of Paris) spoke on the contribution of an interdisciplinary approach; Catherine Marry (LASMAS-IRESCO-CNRS) on the ‘societal approach’ developed by the Laboratoire d'Economie et de Sociologie du Travail and Myriam Campinos-Dubernet (CEREQ) on a recent four country comparative study of training systems.
The aim of the conference was threefold: firstly, to bring together British researchers in the field; secondly, to familiarise them with the French debates and literature; thirdly to discuss the possibility of creating greater coherence in VET as a field of study in Britain.
The conference was extremely successful and over 60 participants attended, including civil servants from the Manpower Services Commission/Training Agency and the Department of Employment as well as academic institutions.
As a result, the head of research at the MSC/TA invited the VET Forum to submit a proposal to run a three year series of workshops at Warwick, to set up a newsletter and to establish a database of research.
This has recently been approved and the first meeting which will set a research agenda will be held in July 1989.

The Working Party on Internal Migration in Britain, which was set up by the Institute of British Geographers in l988, aims at the better understanding of the patterns, causes and implications of migration in Britain.
It recognises the fundamental importance of migration as an agent of economic development and social change and the major significance of the policy issues arising from mismatches between the changing distribution of people and those of jobs, housing and other facilities.
The Working Party's main role is to bring together researchers from different branches of geography and related disciplines to discuss current work on migration in relation to information needs.
Its final report will contain a statement on the main priorities for future research and recommendations on how such work could be encouraged, for instance, through access to better data sources, extra research funding and closer cooperation with private-sector and voluntary agencies.
The Working Party is being funded jointly by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust.
