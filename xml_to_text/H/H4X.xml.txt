Right.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Hello.
Well now, what can I do for you today?
 

  

Aha.
Er there's nothing I cannot, there's nothing wrong, right?
Er there.
It's when I go to have sex.
Mhm.
Right.
It's .
Mhm.
It's sore.
It's actually sore behind there.
 
I mean  
 
Mhm.
It's sore.
Aha.
It's raw.
Now when you say it's sore, is it sore?
No.
at the front?
No.
Or is it sore down the sides?
It's in the sides.
It's in the sides.
How can I say it?you cough, and then you cough and it goes up?
Mhm.
Well see like  in here you know, it's quite sore.
Right.
Mhm.
It's quite sore  as well.
Right.
Let's get that sorted for you.
That's quite easy.
I assume it's kind of 
 
and of course it is.
 
I can  I can have it, but it's sore if you know what I mean.
I mean I 
painful.
I don't really .
.
Yeah.
And I just .
Now er 
I mean I've not had  or  no skin or nothing  it's something like maybe 
Noth nothing broken .
Aye.
You see 
inside, you know.
Aye.
It's, it's, it's th the tissues inside get stretched, cos the side bits.
The front bit hasn't much blood in it, but the two side bits when they fill up with blood and they start to stretch, it's like blowing up a balloon.
.
Aye.
And it stretches all the tissue on this inside, and that's what makes it sore.
And if you're actually having intercourse the tissues get squeezed,
Aye.
and that's why you feel, that's why you feel it catching.
Right.
So we'll get that, now you take this about er oh, say, ten o'clock at night.
It's a spe that's special capsule, take it about ten o'clock at night,
Mhm.
and that will relax the tissues and let it fill up that bit easier .
Right.
Right.
And the other thing you'll find when you're taking this is that you'll be able to get, keep your erection for a while longer, maybe three, four, five minutes longer.
 

So, it helps.
Now, I've said on here take one of these at night.
Mhm.
Er that doesn't, I mean don't take it about six o'clock, seven o'clock at night     you could have, that could have worn off by the time the 
Aye.
emotion comes on you.
So keep it till maybe half, half nine, ten o'clock.
Right.
Something like that.
You take it and then enjoy it, and that should be a  big help to that.
It'll definitely 
 
take the soreness away for you.
No bother  .
complaint.
You sure?
Okay then.
Right.
Okay.
Aye..
Don't be 
 
frightened to come back if you need them again.
 
Okay?
Right.
Thanks.
Cheerio now.
Thank you.
