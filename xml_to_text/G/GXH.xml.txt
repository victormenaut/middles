There was an attendance of around 40.
After an informal get together over cheese 'n' wine the business meeting was held.
The minutes of the A.G.M. held on 27th April, 1992 having been circulated, were approved.
The Chairman, Dr. A. J. Watson, submitted the following report.
–This is the fourth annual report which I have presented to the Village Association in the last five years and it is for me the most pleasing, not because I am standing down as chairman but because I feel that it is the most positive report that I have been able to give.
1992–93 has seen progress in a number of areas and I would like to highlight these first;
1
Tennis Courts Edinburgh District Council now own the land on which the tennis courts and club house stand.
[The grass patch beyond the courts and to the old cooking centre is still owned by the Foulis Trust].
The upgrading of the courts and the club house will be carried out under a scheme jointly funded by the District Council, the Tennis club and the Village Association.
This will require a grant of £1500 from the Village Association, the use of most of the Tennis Club funds [£6–800]and possibly up to £500 as an interest free loan from the Village Association.
The courts will be re-surfaced, the wire fencing repaired and replaced, the windows in the club house replaced, the inside painted and the outside gutters also renewed.
The total spending will be around £6000 with about £2500 coming from the Village Association and Tennis Club to be offset by various grants from the sources which the Tennis Club has contacted.
In view of this considerable outlay it will be essential to attract as many members as possible.
2
Neighbourhood Watch The Neighbourhood Watch has been up and running in the Baberton Mains Estate for some time but up in Juniper Green things have been much slower.
However, a number of small watches have been set up or are in the process of being set up and by the summer about 80% of the village will be covered.
This is due to the hard work of the community policeman, Kenny McLennan, and the constant encouragement of Councillor H.D.G. Fraser, it is hoped that the final few streets not yet covered by the Scheme will be included by the end of the year.
3
The ground between St. Margaret's Court and the Post Office .
This was originally an eyesore but was converted for Trees-R-Us at Christmas.
Although there was a great deal of resistance to the starting of this venture, from many areas, there were no complaints to the committee during or after.
The site was left clean and with a red stone surface
Kevin Doyle of Caledonian Holdings [the owners]wants to keep the site in good order and not have it used as a car park as at present.
His idea is to put bollards down to stop vehicular access and place seats and planters for the use of the community.
Various people are opposed to this scheme as it will give the youth another area to congregate and possibly cause trouble.
The committee has suggested that the bollards and planters should be accepted [the Village Association to stock the planters]but that the seats should be rejected on the grounds already mentioned [approved by those present].

Highways The Regional Council's Greenways proposals for speedier access to and from the town by prohibiting parking on Lanark Road were opposed by the shopkeepers of the village.
They formed a group so that they could put forward a collective case with Ewan Veitch doing most of the research, Yuel McMurray, assisting.
Their arguments were listened to and the Highways Department have amended their proposals to stop at Gillespie Cross Roads and not to extend to Juniper Green and Currie.
There are, however, to be yellow lines at certain corners in Juniper Green.
This will help traffic problems but will create more parking problems.
Lights are to be installed on the Lanark Road near Foulis Crescent.
This will make for greater safety for pupils of Currie High School crossing the road.

Planning Mrs.Ruth Wilson has again kept her eye on this matter for the Association.
There have been no large scale developments proposed for this area.
The development of more than 20 houses at the former Fraser's caravan site between the Scout Hut and the Jet Station in Currie has been opposed on the grounds of increased traffic through Juniper Green.
