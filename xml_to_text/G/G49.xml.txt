I'm, I'm in before the doctor!
.
Aye.
Thought they'd lost you there.


Well now, what can I do for you tonight?
Er it's an insurance line doctor.
Just to keep me 
 
right.
It's my thumb.
That's the excuse I've been giving, and 
Mhm.
that's the one I'm sticking to.
How're things doing?
Alex has not been too well the last couple of days, you know.
Yeah.
Doctor was in this morning.
Mm.
Er  but I, as I say, there's nothing  that anybody can do really 
No, it's 
you know?
just a matter of time.
I meant to phone up this morning for an appointment for Doctor , but I forgot all about it.


I really did, of course she was  the nurse came in, first it was  the doctor,
Mhm.
then it was the priest, then it was another nurse, then the priest and she was getting a bit 

agitated, everybody coming in to see everybody.
She'll be up the pole.
Aye.
Agitated, you know.
Oh, I wish they'd all bloody leave me alone.
say something like that, oh no.
Och aye.
Och aye.
You must, I mean she
She's no more medicine left.
She's no medicine left?
No, not the stuff that you gave her anyway.
Right.
That's  and she knows, she knows perfectly well what's  what's happening.
I mean she's not stupid.
Och aye.
Do you really think so Doctor?
She's not stupid.
I mean she's lived long enough, she's seen it all.
Aye..
She's seen it all before.
And they, they get very very quickly suspicious when, you know, when the nurse is coming in and the priest's coming in and the 
 
doctor's coming in.
They're not so daft.
We don't, we don't give them much credit
No, well.
but they're not  they're not so stupid.
Well, as soon as the doctor mentioned hospital, she was awfully upset.
Who d who mentioned the hospital?
The doctor.
Did he?
Actually, she had mentioned it herself first.
Mhm.
She said, er er no, I think it was the doctor actually mentioned hospital.
I see you've been to the hospital, or something like that.
You know?
Mhm.
With the records.
Aye.
Oh, I'm not going back, I'm not going back there .
After that she was awfully upset.
So I mean that day we had to tell a lot of lies, you know, like that.
Oh.
No, the doctor just meant that er y you were at the hospital,
That's right.
you've not to go back yet.
Oh,just wait till it comes and see what happens.
Aye, just
The doctor said something about a tube in her to stop the, to stop what was it now, the doctor said there's a tube, they put a tube in her  and they don't
Try and ease the swallowing?
Aye, it's something about the jaundice.
And it, it would ease the jaundice as well.
Aye.
It's  it won't, it won't er
No, he says it's 
it won't stay like that.
No.
It won't stay like that.
What, what they did was they took er  on, on the inside, there's er  there's the liver, in there er just at the end of the stomach.
And what they did was they put a tube from here into the next bit of the stomach, that comes round from underneath there, put a tube across there
Ah, right.
so they didn't have to go through this bit
Aha.
because that bit's all  full
Right, right.

So they put a tube across there.
So the stuff coming down, goes through there and then it goes into the rest of the tubes, and away through.
But that will last for  a certain length of time,
Aha.
until this grows  down past that bit.
Or up over the top of that bit.
Ah, I see.
Or it pushes the tube out of shape.
Aha.
