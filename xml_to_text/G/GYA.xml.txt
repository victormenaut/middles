Thank you.
What can I do for you today?
Oh yes.
I  clinic on this blood test,
We did some blood tests, that's right.
We did.
That's right, because you had sugar in your wee and we thought we really must have a look at what we've got, your fasting blood sugar was absolutely fine, so that looks normal.
Had you had your breakfast that morning?
Yeah, erm 
Good.

For the blood test you mean?
