The bad news they haven't arrived so, and that rather, it still
Yes.
it still ties my hands, hands somewhat 
I mean 
because I received no further communication from anyone so
Erm I don't know if this would help, because, you know I'm, I, I said that.
Ooh a D S S book.
Yes that erm you know they wouldn't
Yeah.
actually give some money, well they've sent this, they've sent this letter so
still got a D S S book going so
No this is the o yeah, this is the one that they sent you see?
When I 
Yeah.
came to you and said, you know they won't send any money because I haven't got a note, but because you was a bit, you know, doctor's 
Yeah.
a bit suspicious.
Well you've got a book, so you can still actually er
Yeah, but you see they sent this on the twenty ninth of June
Yeah.
but the thing is this doctor's note runs out yesterday,
Mm.
see, so I can't really cash any more, you know?
Why not?
Well because I haven't had a doctor's note and it makes it a bit difficult if I cash it.
But they would have only given you a book for 
Right.
that long, if you had a valid doctor's note for that time, surely?
No, no.
You have to get another one, you see.
It doesn't work like that.
I mean that's some proof,I mean  I  
It's proof that someone's issued a book to you, yeah.
I'm not quite, has, is th it gives no indication of why it's been issued, that's the catch.
Well, see these are the ones that I sent in and I didn't think they would, they would agree with because they were duplicates unless they found the original.
Mm.
Do you follow?
No they won't accept duplicates as a rule.
Well they put those in anyway, so unless they found the original ones,
That's, that's two months and that keep  that keeps you covered for a while, doesn't it?
But you see the thing is, that's true but sometimes the way they deal with it, they deal with it say eight weeks, so which makes it what?
About sevent 
Yeah, he's just put yeah he's just put depression.
I mean how do you actually feel at the moment?
Well, I feel better than I was, but I've been at Haywoods Heath which was a religious community
Hmm.
and er I feel, I feel as though I'm generally 
Mm.
Aye.
What about sleep patterns?
That's fine.
And mood during the day?
That's fine, not too bad.
See if you're actually better medically
Mm.
you actually become fit for work.
Right.
Ah  in which case it'd be wrong for me to say that you're not fit for work anyway .
Right.
So er I mean if you, if you, you know, if you do feel you're looking better I mean you look, you know
Right.
fairly okay.
Right.
So I mean if you, if that's how you actually feel then what we should really do is to sign a note at some stage saying you are fit for work on a certain date.
Mhm.
And er then what will happen is the benefit you receive will change from
Right.
erm sickness benefit or invalidity benefit depending 
Mm.
how long you've been off for, to unemployment 
 
benefit, if you're eligible.
So I, and, and to be honest I think that's what we ought to do at this stage,
Mhm.
if you remain fairly well.
Now obviously
Mm.
if how you are
Mm.
changes,
Mhm.
You know it's a different ball game 
Mm.
and then we have to reassess you and say you're medically 
Mm.
unfit and then we sign you off.
But then 
Mm.
also we ought to be treating it, are you not actually having any active treatment at the moment are you?
No.
No.
You see  you see I don't mean to be erm rude or anything but as I'm sure you understand you can't really you know, you know write a note without my doctor's notes, because you see I, I think if I get a job at the moment I think it'll just, it won't last
No.
Well I, I 
 
I could write a note 
 
on my own assessment,
Right yes  
but I have got nothing to back up, it's a bit like
before you have the notes?
Oh I can, oh yes I can, I could 
Yeah.
write a note treating 
Right.
you as my own patient
Right.
on a, on how I find you at a particular time.
Right.
But what I can't do is to look back and saying you've been, you are like this now but 
 
we know from your previous history, that this 
Right.
is the course of events
and perhaps it'd be reasonable to wait longer before we say you're fit for work.
And I haven't got much evidence
You can't do that until you get the notes can you?
Well it's a bit i well I, well I could do but it's a bit tricky I mean to some 
Right.
extent I'd be happy to keep you going for a bit longer.
Right.
There's no .
What I don't really want to do is to sign you off sick long term, without really knowing I mean 
Mhm.
what's been happening before, what's been said 
Yeah.
to you, what's been given 
Yeah.
to you.
Yeah.
Exactly what sort of thing you've been in.
And you can say some of 
Yeah that's, that's  what I  
to me but I d I still, I don't get the same feeling from you as perhaps I might with medical notes, if you see what I mean?
Well I, I, no I agree 
Yeah.
with you precisely 
Yeah.
I think that you can't really make a decision until you have that literature, you can't.
It's tricky.
But what I'm, what I'm, is because you've got this order book
Yeah.
and these, you know things from the benefits er agency, because if I cash any more it makes it so I mean
Yeah.
what, you see I don't know when these notes are going to come up 
Yeah.
you see?
Well what I 
And I need this cash .
Yeah.
I mean what I suggest we 
 
do
Yeah.
given you're, given how you are at the moment, which 
Right.
is probably not one hundred percent medically fit,
Yeah.
is to actually give you another note for the moment for say 
Right.
erm where are we now?
We're July, so if I say another six weeks, that'll actually get 
Right.
us through to the first week of September.
Right, so these  
And then 
you can  
and then have another chat.
And if you are fairly okay then we'll probably say well we'll sign you off at this stage anyway.
But 
Mm.
at least we'll have the notes to back up what we're doing, and I 
Right.
think that'd be sensible.
It'll 
Right.
keep you ticking over for the moment 
 
which is what you need.
Yeah, yeah.
And it'll erm, and I think that'll be reasonable.
Yeah.
Is that okay?
That seems okay for now, yeah but
It's a sort of compromise 
when you 
decision but it is difficult to know which way to go, when you're actually up you know, I, I wouldn't say you're a hundred percent but I wouldn't say 
Right.
there's anything too much wrong with you either.
Right.
Now what I've got to put a diagnosis on this, so if I write depression cos that has been the problem hasn't it?
Right, yes.
Yeah, is that fair enough?
Yeah.
And if I put six weeks, now this'll overlap slightly with the present one, that doesn't matter the D S S don't give two hoots from that point of view, and that'll then run out six weeks, which is about the beginning of September
Right.
exactly.
But I, you know, I agree with this, thanks for the, writing the note, but 
That's okay.
erm   especially that when you get those er notes from Haywoods Heath,
Yeah.
and then see what you think.
But I mean I don't want to stay on the sickness but it is
Yeah.
invalidity.
It's Sickness Benefit on your 
Mm.
Income Support.
So it's 
Mm.
exactly the same amount of money 
Yeah, oh yeah.
So you won't gain any extra, yeah.
not Unemployment Benefit,ordinary Income Support 
Mhm.
but, you know, when you get those notes if you could look at them and see what you think 
Mm.
Yeah I think they'll be informative.
Mm.
Oh yes, yes .
Yeah.
It's a question of getting them back, they haven't long gone but er
Right.
they will return, complete I hope.
Okay .
Right.
is that there's no point in, in er me going to work if it's going to just, you know, work out
No.
so I'm just, you know, unemployed again.
Yeah.
But as I say, when you get those notes, if you really, you know, try and understand them so  you know  
And if I can read the other doctor's handwriting.
Yes.
Anyhow we'll sort that out in September, I'm sure they'll be there.
We sent in an urgent request three 
Yes.
weeks ago for those and I'd be very surprised if they don't  soon 
Apparently they should be on their way because Nottingham was er
They should be.
Yeah.
They should be.
Alright, thanks very much .
Right okay, take care of yourself.
