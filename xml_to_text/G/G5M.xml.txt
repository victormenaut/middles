I've come of a new  
 
please.
Let's have a look.
This is the  Noraday yeah .
 Noraday yeah.
Everything okay on that?
Yeah, fine yeah .
Periods behaving?
Erm sometimes I have a a good period, like 
Yeah.
I used to on er
Yeah.
other pill.
yeah that's right.
But sometimes I don't have one or 
Yeah.
sometimes it's just one 
Yeah.
day.
Yeah, a bit erratic ?
Er Yeah.
But 
Right, okay.
no problem at all.
Yes , that can happen on  Noraday Waterworks?
Bowels?
Breasts?
Yeah fine.
All behaving?
Yes.
Right, now what we do need to do today is to get your blood pressure checked.
Yeah.
How are things going on from the other point of view?
Erm it get's
Mm.
a bit off still .
Yes.
Yeah.
we h we still haven't heard anything.
From the psychologist?
Er no,go to see him .
you've you've got from them, certainly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you're still in limbo as far as the 
Yeah.
the civil action is concerned?
Erm even no second inquest, nothing .
Oh.
But er apparently  got a solicitor.
Er we haven't had to see anybody about that and he sent us a letter saying that he'd like to see us and we went and he says it there might not be a second inquest.
Oh.
Might go straight to court.
Ah.
And then we had a phone call from the police, about a month ago.
Oh right, good.
Saying that it had gone straight to court, it was in court, you know,
Oh right.
but we haven't heard anything.
Oh well I mean they may have been adjourned or a
Even though 
it may have been referred to a higher court.
You think so.
Erm
I mean we we haven't heard anything directly, I'm only glad that the police are actually telling you something.
Yeah yeah.


It it was a big shock that day, when we had that phone call 
Mm.
But it was I You know, to know that you haven't got to fight,
That's right, yeah .
T to take him to court.
Erm
But it's a long process.
I mean we have dealings with solicitors for all sorts of things, asking for reports and we send a lot of notes away to have a lot of er  medical opinion reports and they take ages to come back.
And that's a These are the preliminary things that the solicitor must go through before they get near court, so
Yeah.
the people 
Yeah.
who it's actually They're actually dealing with are waiting months and months and months and er 
Yeah.
it looks like that in your case.
We 
 
we may well have to provide the medical report on your behalf, yet.
God.
But n no-one has approached me to do so.
No no.
So er But it wouldn't surprise me if some sort of medical report on how you are doesn't reach court.
It erm Mr  who we see Psychologist erm The first week I went to see him, Oh .
It t d certainly, you know erm
Yeah.
It's very 
Erm 
hard.
We Do you know when we start doing something, we'll do it and even if we do things different  gonna say?
We thinking well why are we doing it this way ?
Mm.
So er everything's pulling at us,
Yeah.
you know.
W we seem as though we do something and we  W we are absolutely drained ,
Mm.
you get We want to push ourselves.
That's right.
But do you know, once we start doing something w we're just drained all the while.
In some ways you're in limbo cos you've you've got nothing to aim towards.
You've 
No.
got I mean if Even if you had a date to aim towards, even if it was six months hence, at least that would help you, you could 
Yeah.
aim towards it and work towards it.
Yeah.
But er and I think it's most unfair on you two really and the whole thing.
And you you come off worse than anyone else and er but there's no real way of speeding that up, they can't give 
No.
dates and they can't say what's going to happens  they have to go through, sift the evidence, arrange it all in a certain order,
and then go and
Rachael, she's coming home Well she was she was discharged Friday from hospital .
Mm.
Oh right.
And er they thought Thursday they'd have to do an operation on her by taking a piece of bone from her hip,
Mhm.
and putting it in the leg.
But they said it was knitting together lovely.
Good good.
But then they took the pins out,
Ah.
let her go home Friday, discharged her the day after.
She'd put too much weight on it, and she's back in hospital, she's broke it.
Well they'll probably have to put at least the bone in there, it's a bone graft.
They've put it in plaster at the moment .
Yeah,
But s you know she she's mending, it's erm
She she's coming okay, I think
Mm.
You know to see her as well, that's som you know
Mm.
But we don't go as often now.
No.
Erm,
Right.
Lovely, and 
Th The six packets of  Noraday 
Yeah, yeah.
Your smear is due in December.
Now I'm going to leave that with you.
If you really don't feel like coming up for a smear at that time, that's fine and we'll understand why.
And w There's an awful lot 
Yeah.
of pressure on you from an awful lot of other sources, so don't worry about it.
And
Yeah.
But er you are 
 
actually officially due in December and obviously we'd like 
Is that me three years?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'd like 
Yeah.
to get that done.
Yeah.
Don't seem like three years.
Oh, no I'm sure.
The psychologist of course will continue to see you.
And if 
Yeah.
you want to pop in and have a chat with me in between that's fine, but I'm not here next week.
Yeah, yeah.
So that's that.
Er and I hope everything goes a smoothly as possible.
If there are any medical reports to do, we'll get them done as soon as possible but you know,a is that's very much out of our hands, and 
Yeah.
we can only wait on your solicitors, their solicitors, there's the police, the court, the entire system.
You see we haven't notified any solicitor at all, it was 
No.
just when we got back off holiday we'd got a letter from 
Well it's If the police are doing the prosecuting then you may 
Yeah.
not have to bother 
Well it it Apparently there is a clause in Lee's insurance er that got the solicitor,
Yeah.
and he notified us 
Right.
and he said he would b represent.
But then he mentioned, when we wen to see him, he says  we will deal with this but you must get somebody for civil 
Yeah.
action.
Yeah.
And we asked him if he did civil action .
Oh right , yeah.
And he said yes he'd 
Mm.
he would You know he hasn't g The records haven't got to be released then to 
No.
anybody else.
he he will be able to get them.
But it's just hoping that everything goes right, but at least we 
 
haven't got to fight for prosecution.
No no.
That should go through, but er it's a question of when it's going to be though.
Yeah, yeah.
Do they usually take time like this?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Things from er data whenever can take ages and ages and ages to And you know doctors get sued every now and again, perish the thought,
Oh  
Perish the thought but when


y w you when you keep hearing reports in the medical journals about doctors being sued, and it can be several years after the event that the case comes to court.
Now it won't be that long in your case, but it just goes to show how lengthy the whole thing can be .
Yea yeah yeah.
And it's er
But it's so 
But 
much hurt, you know .
That's right.
but Pete he he still getting up very early, he doesn't sleep 
Mm.
very good .
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean in some ways 
And 
I think he's more effected by it than you.
And 
I Like erm Psychologist said erm
there's a lot of anger there isn't there?
Yeah.
He says I'm still with denial,
Yeah.
and Pete knows it's happened.
Mm.
I erm If i try not to give way, it leaves so much up here
Mm.
I can keep thinking it's not happened.
Yeah.
That's right.
But 
You know.
But 
wor working through it all, it's very very painful.
Yeah.
And it's easier in the short term not to have  In the long term you get more problems.
Yea yeah.
I I've found that.
You know, like I say, I try to do some things different, and then that don't work sometimes cos I think well why am I doing 'em like that.
Mm.
I wouldn't be doing this if it hadn't happened.
Do you do you
Mhm.
Do you now what I mean?
So like you say it can cause  
 
that few more problems.
But erm probably if we wasn't  so much and
Mm.
I think he 'd be  
I think sometimes he's still being protective.
Yeah.
He's still being protective .
Mm.
That's right.
And erm Dunno.
The police i know, went to see Rachael, and they still can't understand why he didn't use an islander, you know?
No.
And it's just unbelievable.
Mm.
But everybody's allowed a mistake but
when you've got a big articulated lorry ,
Bit of drastic mistake to make.
You know if you You know I can't stop feeling as though that morning he used that lorry as a weapon.
Mm.
You know.
Er I don't  I think as it goes on y you do start and get that anger that anger so bad, but erm But I'll leave you to get on Doctor.
And
