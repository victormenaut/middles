Dr Laurence Villard-MacKintosh Department of Community Medicine Gibson Laboratory Building Radcliffe Infirmary Oxford OX2 6HE
Dear Laurence
I have written to Professor Vessey to request permission to film at the Radcliffe Infirmary and to interview you in part of our Project Video English language teaching video programme.
Assuming that Professor Vessey is willing to allow us to film, the arrangements will be as follows.
We intend to arrive at the Radcliffe Infirmary at 10.30 am on Thursday 15 June and we would hope to complete the interview with you in approximately an hour.
We would also hope to film the opening sequence of the Health section (our presenter having his blood pressure taken) at the Radcliffe Infirmary as well; I have mentioned this to Professor Vessey.
I am enclosing a copy of the script for the section on Health.
As you will see, your task is principally to respond to the statements by a number of school children on the kind of meals they eat and to say whether or not this constitutes a healthy diet.
We will have recorded the interviews with the children a week earlier and should be able to give you a transcript of their answers.
Very many thanks for your help.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
Yours sincerely

Seeing David Eastment's ‘CALL Video: Discussion Draft 1’ document, I feel that there may be a serious obstacle to the whole venture.
We would clearly want to base as much exemplification on our own published/to be published material and would certainly want in certain circumstances to veto things competing directly with ours.
(Simulations and the Tribble Concordance are cases in point.)
Bell, on the other hand, might start wanting to pretend to behave in some sort of pseudo British Council evenhanded way over published materials.
In which case we might wish that 50% of the footage is shot in IH or whatever!
Perhaps I am seeing difficulties where none need exist but it's worth keeping an eye on.

I must first thank you and your colleagues at the Centre for Continuing Education for making my first trip across the Atlantic and to Montreal such an enjoyable and useful one.
It was a great pleasure to meet the team of authors and please thank Susan Parks for giving up so much of her time to devote to going through the manuscripts.

Paul Shipton C/O The Cambridge Academy of English High Street GURTON Cambridge
Dear Paul
I am enclosing a copy of the final version of the script for Project Video.
As we discussed at the meeting on May 17 1989, it would be extremely helpful if you could look for places where captions carrying additional information could appear at the foot of the screen and write the caption.
An English City, for example, a caption could appear as Tom Hutchinson climbs the tower saying ‘There are 275 steps in the tower of York Minster’.
The use of the captions will need to be reasonably limited and, of course, the language level of their content at an appropriately low level.
I think the best way to proceed will be for you to produce as many captions as you think fit and we can then select from these during editing.
For producing the captions I would like to offer you a fee of 150 which is in addition to any other payments for work on the Activity Book.
I hope you will find this satisfactory.
I will arrange for all our research information on various locations to be sent on to you as soon as possible.
Finally, would it be possible to have the copy for the captions by Friday 16 June 1989?
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
Robert Maidment Producer/Editorial Manager Electronic Publishing & Development

Contact during Project Video Shoot
During the Project Video shoot we shall be moving around a great deal and there may be occasions when people need to contact us but are unable to do so.
Consequently it is vital that messages can be left in Oxford and we need to establish a system to cover your phone (by diverting calls or whatever) continuously between 9.30 and 5.30.
It might also help to give the switchboard an alternative (Tim or Simon?) number to try if your line is engaged.

I believe it will be delivered to your house on Sunday morning.
This vehicle will then remain with the production for the remainder of the shoot.
I would be most grateful if you could cast your eye over the script; the one area that seems to have gone a little awry is the Language Review but I'm sure we can sort this out during the shoot.

Peter Skehan/Paul Meara: SLA Series
I met only Peter on 30 May as Paul was ill, and that only briefly.
Peter began by saying he had decided to use his spare time for research rather than editing a new series.
By the end of our discussion, however, he was still prepared to go on thinking about an editorial involvement — I (mis?) led him to believe the amount of work could be contained and he would be given good backing by OUP.
Peter had also clearly given considerable thought to what a new series might contain, in terms of both topic and author.
Against a background of thinking that a series should: a) find a balance between the too general and the too specific (in their Arnold series he would say that MacLoughlin was about right, Tarone too specific), and b) be for the most part single-author monographs and only rarely, if ever, be edited collections of papers (while recognizing that CUP has produced the occasionally successful collection), he suggested the following topics/authors:— universal grammar/Kevin Gregg, Japan?— input and interaction in SLA/Jackie Schachter/Teresa Pica, Pennsylvania?(could be two separate volumes)— cognitive processing and SLA/?—‘instructed’ SLA/Patsy Lightbown?— social factors and situations in SLA/Roger Andersen, UCLA?— age and neurolinguistic factors/Mike Long?(who has apparently said he would not want to publish in his own series)
Peter said he thought Lydia White (Linguistics/McGill, Montreal) had still not placed her book on universal grammar with a publisher although Tim Blakey has since reported that when he contacted her when he was there last week, she refused to see ‘yet another publisher’.
Possibly worth a phone call from you (Dept 0101514 — 3984143 Home 933 9306).
Page 2
Peter and I agreed that the next step should be for us (you?) to circulate the above topic/author proposals as an Aunt Sally to Paul and Jackie Schachter to see if this coincides at all with their thinking.
If it does not then clearly one is at square one.
Peter should of course, be copied in on anything sent to the others.
Once we have given Paul and Jackie the chance to comment, we should then try to reconvene the meeting with Peter and Paul.
Peter's commitment is certainly not total but I think his interest can be maintained if we don't frighten him.
The idea of a book each a year from the three editors seemed to calm him and I am sure he realizes that this involves more than reading the one script.

1) While attending the APPI Conference in Lisbon last week, I spoke to Jean Greenwood about the Grammar Resource Book.
She said she would be letting you have a 5-page proposal plus sample activities by July, as agreed with you.
She also told me she had identified in the recently-arrived Assistant Director of Studies at the British Council/ Institute, Steve Jenkinson, a likely collaborator.
She felt he would be most useful on what she described as the ‘solid’ material, balancing her more ‘fanciful’approach.
She would be responsible for integrating the two contributions and making sure it will be a coherent whole and she would share her royalty with him at a rate to be determined by the proportion of the work each ends up doing.
I met Jenkinson briefly and he seems to have plenty of practical, if not authorial experience; there is apparently a profile of him in January's EFL Gazette.
He also has his own Amstrad.
Jean would appreciate a note from you about what royalties she might expect in the near future, remembering she's had a 500 advance.
2) I also met Diana England who teaches at IH in Lisbon and who wants to put up a proposal for a Resource Book on Spelling.
Her approach would be to treat spelling as a part of writing on the one hand and of pronunciation on the other.
She fully understands that it'll be up to you and Alan to decide whether you want a book on this subject and if you think it is a complete non-starter you might like to stop her in her tracks.
Alternatively you might like to wait to see the proposal first as she is a most serious person who struck me as a likely author.
Her address is:
Casal Paijoanes 2670 Loures Portugal Tel: Lisbon 9836569
3) This time an applied linguistics proposal.
Peter Maddison, Head of the International School of the Algarve (Porches, 8400 Lagoa) has done a lot of work in the area of content in language teaching, particularly in respect of French as a foreign language.
I have my doubts about this one but you may in due course get a proposal from him.
Could be up Henry's street.

Pictures for Rostrum Shots in Project Video
There are two areas in the Project Video programme in which we need to have some stills or artwork and I wonder if you might be able to help us find suitable material?
1 In the Health section of the programme, we need to illustrate (sc.
3):
a 19th century hospital
a sick child (preferably appearing to be from the past, ie. black and white photo/line drawing)
2 In the Space section it would help us to be able to illustrate scene 14 in some way.
Here there's an interview sequence about the future of space travel which (we hope!) will throw up such concepts as:
space stations
inter-planetary probes
cities in space
cities on the Moon, Mars, etc.
I would imagine these being illustrated either by ‘artists' impressions’ or dramatic sci-fi illustrations.
Just to be really awkward, would it be possible for you to turn something up for us by 16 (preferably 15) June?!

I'm afraid, however, that I have to ask you not to bring anyone else with you (I'm not quite sure if you were intending to) because it really would create problems.

I am writing to ask if it might be possible for Oxford University Press to make use of the track ‘The Chocolate Girl’ by Deacon Blue in a non-broadcast educational video.
The video programme is titled Project Video and will be distributed on cassette to secondary schools worldwide for use in teaching English as a foreign language.
Project Video is provisionally scheduled for publication in September 1989 and we anticipate sales over the first three years to be in the region of 2,000 cassettes.
We would like to make use of the tracks during a sequence in the programme where music is heard coming from a car radio.
We would anticipate using between 30 and 60 seconds of each song.
If we are able to make use of the track in the way specified I would be extremely grateful if you could let me know what the cost will be.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfully

There should be with this note the following documents:
1 Letter from THE SCIENCE MUSEUM.
Letter agreeing times and personnel from their side.
Pls note third para — let me know if you want me to do anything about this.
They've attached a map of Loading Bay for your info.
(tot: 2 pages)
2 Letter from PROPERTY SERVICES AGENCY.
Letter is basically a contract which they require our agreement/signature and return to them.
Particular passages to note are 1c, h and j, and 2. (tot: 2 pages)
3 Letter from DINAMATION INTERNATIONAL CORP as discussed with you earlier today (5/6), they are looking to get their name on end credits and on the inlay (seems a bit excessive to me!?).
Also draft of letter I'll put before Simon for signature once Rob has decided on the crediting point.
(tot: 2 pages)
Julie Oldfield (from the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY) phoned: I have faxed her a copy of Dinamation's letter for information and confirmed shoot times at 1630 to 1730 on Wednesday; she was worried about the amount of equipment you might be bringing in 4 vehicles — you said you would have a camera and one light.
Please let her know if it will be more than this.
4 Copy of letter to Giles Askham — we need to let him know where to meet up in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
(tot: 1 page)
Music permissions letters going out today: Rob needs to think about the choral music for York Minster (maybe the contact at the Minster can help?) and ‘The Ride  of the Valkyrie ’— any further details?
Which recording/etc.
As I mentioned on the phone, if you want a mass eat-in at Crest Hotel in York, they'll need a booking.
It's arranged that you would eat out or in small parties at the hotel, as I thought maybe you'd want to get away from each other by then….
Tony Hewitt (Acton High School) phoned this afternoon: confirms all OK for Thursday morning.
Can you please collect the children from the school at 8.00?
You'll have to go up the drive and into the front doors of the  school : they're assembling outside the main office.
He also asked if he could send one extra girl along (that makes 3 girls/2 boys).
I said I thought it would be OK but I would phone him back if not.
Please confirm OK with either me or him (01 992 5566 ext2500).
Hope you managed to get some sort of break over the weekend and that you're not too behind on schedule — it'll probably pick up later on in the shoot!

Oxford Language System
The Oxford Language System is a loose-leaf approach to self-study.
At the Survival level, packs of loose-leaf materials will be available to fit into a Filofax/Organiser ring binder.
At other levels materials will fit into a larger format ring binder, possibly Deskfax.
The Survival level packs will offer words and phrases in bilingual editions and act as a phrasebook, dictionary and aide-memoire.
The larger format will offer at 3–4 levels a range of self-study language teaching materials.
The loose-leaf format gives us a vehicle for recycling suitable parts of the backlist and for offering new materials in packs from which the customer can choose on a mix-'n'-match basis.
Where appropriate cassettes will accompany each pack.
The aim is to launch as a pilot operation at least 8 packs at the Survival level in late autumn 1989/early spring 1990 using Milan, Italy as a test market.
The feedback will be used to modify existing packs and to develop further packs for launching OLS Survival level in France, Germany and possibly Japan in 1990.
Once the survival level has been established, the aim is to develop the larger format and start recycling the backlist as well as commissioning new materials.
The attached NEPP, which gives further information, indicates that profit margins are good.
2 colour is to be used at Survival level and there is no cost for binding — the sheets will be shrink wrapped — or for stiff covers.
Specifically written material can be negotiated on a fee basis and existing materials on a royalty or fee basis.
The range of packs can be changed or added to according to demand.
For the larger format the market could include self-access centres.

Dear Catherine
It was a great pleasure to meet you at the Conference in Lisbon and to talk about your proposal for an introduction to CALL.
When we talked we agreed that I should send you a copy of the Resource Book for Teachers on CALL.
This is still a month or two short of publication but I have managed to get hold of a set of proofs which I am sending you under separate cover.
We agreed that you would look at this to see whether there will be a need for something along the lines of your proposal once the Resource Book has been published.
Yours sincerely

There follows this sheet a 5 page letter from the York Castle Museum — I discussed this with you today.
The last page needs completing and returning to Helena Moore.
The Hilton should be able to fax this back to me rather than you trying to get it up to York.
Rob asked me to book a car: from 9.00 am on Friday 9/6 (available at the Press — let me know if delivery address should be different); to be returned on Sunday 11/6 to Swan National, Market Service Station, Old Vicarage, Preston (0772) 53844.
Preston office covers Lancaster.
There won't be anyone in offices — just park up and drop keys through door.
Can you let me know who will be driving it?
Filming in the University Parks at Rainbow Bridge next Thursday morning at 0830 to 1000: basically yes, all OK.
Please be aware that there will be quite a few people using the bridge around 0830, although this should ease off towards 0900.
It's very difficult for a vehicle to be permitted to enter the parks: let me know if this is absolutely essential.
A Permit to film is on the way to OUP.
(Dr Robert Lucas: Keble : 272726)
Invoice received today from Whitelion: editing services sound dub (half-hour) £50.00.
Can Rob say OK or not?
I'll get it cleared here if OK.
Parking for tomorrow: NCP option: Miss Pell (01 499 7050) to phone me back re.
reserving parking in NCP Abingdon Street.
If I can clear this today I will and phone you, otherwise I'll let you know tomorrow am.
Alternative standby is Pay & Display in King Charles Street.
Chris hotel room for tonight/tomorrow night confirmed to Hilton.
Will he need room for next Thursday?

Dear Mr Speyer
Thank you for your letter of 2 June to my colleague Robert Maidment.
Unfortunately, he is unable to respond himself as he is away from the office filming at present, but we have discussed with him the requests you make in your letter.
Therefore, please take this response as agreement with your requests for copies of the video and book and for incorporation of your company name on the end credits of the video and in the acknowledgements in the book accompanying the video.
A further acknowledgement on the video box is difficult for us to provide but I hope you will accept the two credits as specified as being sufficient.
As to the possibility of the crew shooting some extra footage whilst at the museum, I am afraid this would have to be dependent on the time taken for the shots we plan for use in our Project Video.
If time permits, we would be happy to accommodate you as far as we can.
Robert Maidment will contact you as soon as he is able to let you know how much footage we have.
I note the agreement for a payment of £200 for the use of the animated dinosaurs for the purposes of filming.
Could you please let me know where you would like the cheque sent, and to whom we should make it out?
Yours sincerely

Central News
Central News is a product aimed at students at the intermediate level and above.
Initially we are aiming to publish two editions (Central News 1 and Central News 2) which will consist of a 30 minute video cassette and a two colour Activity Book.
The video cassette is a compilation of approximately 10 news items selected from the output of the Central South news studio based in Abingdon.
The Activity Book will provide activities based around these news items including reading material that parallels the TV items drawn from the local and national press.
The TV items are being selected on the criteria of level of interest and validity as examples of authentic spoken English ie. we tend to go for ordinary people speaking to camera rather than voice over or straight presentation to camera.
The author of the Activity Book is Tony Cornish (who may be involving a writing partner whose name escapes me — Tim Blakey will confirm).
Unfortunately, Central News has had to take second place to Project Video (which we are shooting at the moment) but we are aiming for October 1989 publication for Central News 1 (video and book) and January 1990 for Central News 2 (video and book).
We are aiming to price the video comparatively low (c. £25 per cassette) and if the project takes off we intend to publish further editions, possibly on a regular subscription basis.
Please contact either Tim, Vicki or myself (if you can find me!) if you would like to know more.

Dear Jonathan
Grapevine
Now we have the Video and Activity Book contract out of the way (I hope), we must press ahead with the main course book contract.
If I may refer you back to your note of our meeting on 18 January you recommended a more hardline wording for 15.1 and 15.2 on the main course, which (given the less-direct competitive nature of the components) we were willing to go more gently with on the video and Activity Book.
Would your view now be that we should use the 18 January wording?
Incidentally there has been no response from Hartley to the 15 February letter from Russells.

We are aiming at a publication date of mid-November this year for the IBM version.
Unfortunately I am unable to give you a firm price for the software as we have not yet completed the development stage, but it will be somewhere in the region of 65.
The User Guide will be published alongside the software and again at this stage I am unable to give you a price.
I have included your name on my mailing list for EFL software, and will write to you with more information as soon as I am able.

I'm trying to get hold of you this afternoon for the following reasons (listed in case we don't manage to talk):
1 SCIENCE MUSEUM: Interview with James Goddard: he has to leave at 9.00 for Heathrow but will be on the premises from 0630 onwards.
Can you please bring forward his interview?
(Michelle: 01 938 8188).

I remember that you intended to do some copying (I don't know of what), and there appears to be a lead missing (audio JVC to monitor Din: 2 pin).

Dear Marc
I called you yesterday as requested but couldn't get past your automatic switchboard.
I was about to contact you anyway.
I have been talking to colleagues here in Oxford about the use of OALDCE 3/e in one of your hand held devices.
Enthusiasm for the idea is great but I wonder if you could provide me with the following information?
1 What will be the specification of the hand held device or devices you will want to include OALD in?
Is it the 4000 model incorporating speech output or something else?
2 What do you expect the retail price to be? $399 was suggested for the 4000, I think, of which you said $240 would be your net receipts.
Correct?
3 Can you give us an approximate idea of sales you'd be expecting over a three-year period?
4 What would be your ideas for our coming to some joint marketing plan in territories where our resources are greater than or equal to yours?
5 How would you see the formalization of our having a hand in preparing the initial print material (colleagues have not expressed undiluted admiration for that which accompanies the 3000) and for producing sound pedagogic printed backup material for selling in addition to the hand held device.

I need answers to these questions to be in a position to request formally of our governing board that you should be free to use the name ‘Oxford’.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Mr Promhouse
Frank Tompa of the University of Waterloo E-Mailed me some time ago with your request for a copy of the tape for the OALDCE 3/e Electronic computer-readable dictionary.
I apologise for the delay in response — we had to track down which university you were at!
The tape has been offered to a number of research institutions who have agreed to provide feedback to us on a pilot basis.
This feedback will be used to guide us in the possible uses of the tape when we come to launching the 4th edition in early 1990, which will be the published version of the tape.
In our choice of institutions to whom we have sent the tape, we have tried to get as wide a scope of research as possible and have now completed our quota for the pilot.
Unfortunately this means that we are not able to send you a copy, but suggest that your university might be interested in investing in a copy once the 4th edition becomes available next year.
My apologies for not being able to include you in our pilot.

Dear Mr Cornish
This letter is to let you know our intent subject to contract to draw up a publishing agreement for the components for the Central News I and II videos.
These are Activity Book 1 and Activity Book 2.
In anticipation of the agreement we would like to offer you a fee of 2,500 for Activity Book 2 and a further 2,500 for Activity Book 2.
We could offer you an advance of 1,000 and the rest on completion for Activity Book 1, and the same arrangement for Activity Book 2.
The total fee of 5,000 is in outright purchase of the copyright of the material.
I should mention that if for any reason we did not go ahead or had to withdraw from publication, we reserve the right to give you adequate notice of our intention.
Any advance paid, however, would be irrecoverable.
This is standard practice, but such an event is unlikely.
I hope this proposal is satisfactory to you.
If it is, could you please acknowledge this by signing and returning the attached copy of this letter.
Arrangements for payment of the advance can then be made.

Dear Malcolm
I attach a proposal drafted somewhat off the top of my head, which you may like to use to open discussions with the Navarra Ministry.
The thing would only be viable if our contribution were limited to, say, the payment of the fees to two tutors from outside Spain and perhaps two from inside.
One would be looking to the Navarrans to pay accommodation.
Presumably one would be able to charge participants?
Would one be offering some diploma and could this be built into any existing academic credit scheme?
The Barcelona Summer Institute, for example, counts towards the Institute of Education, London and Columbia Teachers' College course/accreditations.
As to OUP's constitution and relationship to the University, the attached handout will perhaps give you what you need.
I know I don't need to tell you, but for the record, I will have to clear all this in Oxford and so we shouldn't get too far down the line.
On the other hand, in order to get clearance, I will have to provide an idea of costs and benefits and so anything you can do on this will be most helpful.
It is perhaps worth recording here, particularly for the benefit of Alan, to whom I am copying this letter, that the idea, while being born out of a most pleasant lunch with Terri Peralla, stands up well in my view to critical evaluation.
My visit in February (a report is forthcoming) showed me that Northern Spain is at an excellent stage of development to be used as a test bed for software.
Navarra is I believe unique in that it provides a politically acceptable centre such that both the Basque Country and Catalonia would not find it embarrassing to attend a summer school there, and in that it is sufficiently endowed while remaining approachable to provide an alternative to Madrid, which would I imagine present far greater bureaucratic difficulty.
Page 2
But I should stress that this is still very much a personal interpretation by somebody only marginally involved in the market.
How can we test it?
Only by consulting Spaniards, Catalans and Basques?
If a Pamplona Institute on CALL only attracted Navarrans then we would have failed and would have been better off doing something specifically for Catalonia or Madrid.
I will try and get the report to you before you go on leave, and Alan and I can talk more about this in July.
Best wishes.
Yours sincerely

PAMPLONA SUMMER (?)
INSTITUTE ON CALL
Draft Proposal
1 Sponsors
Jointly the Navarra Ministry of Education and Oxford University Press.
2 Purpose
To provide a forum for discussing the major issues of CALL in Spanish schools and to develop a cadre of ‘multipliers’ to work within the Spanish school system.
3 Teaching Staff
To be drawn from experts, teachers, teacher trainers in Spain and elsewhere in Europe who are already active in CALL.
4 Participants
Key teachers who can, with training, perform a multiplier role on return to their institutions, which already have shown a commitment to introducing CALL.
Maximum 30.
5 Course Structure and Contents
Two levels, the first for teachers with no CALL experience, the second for those with some experience.
The following topics would be covered:
basic familiarity with hardware
types of software
using authoring programs and software tools
electronic databases
types of learning environments appropriate for CALL
integrating CALL into the curriculum
software evaluation criteria.
There would be an emphasis on hands-on experience and practical work.
6 Accreditation
(?— see letter)
7 Duration and Timing
One week (or two?)
Last week June /first week July 1990 or Easter 90 or Early September 90

I follow this fax with confirmation orders for the following quantities of both parts 1 and 2 of the above title:
VHS PAL 501 BETA PAL 201 U-MATIC PAL 21
We would like to use WHITE amaray boxes for the VHS and BETA versions of this title rather than the black ones we normally use.
I understand that you are holding the PAL masters for both parts, which we would like to use for the first run of this title, to get a better quality duplication.
Future duplications will be made from a PAL copy master as normal.
I will arrange for the packaging for this title to be delivered to you tomorrow morning.
When our messenger arrives with the packaging for Grapevine, can you please give him the PAL masters for Business Assignments?
Many thanks.

These were supplied with regard to our title Project Video, a non-broadcast educational video for teaching English as a foreign language.
The video is being filmed at the moment and editing is planned for next week.
It is probable that we ask permission to use certain shots in the production, and as we have not got much time before the edit, I wonder if you could let us have 1″ PAL copies of these three films?
We would also like to ask permission to hold on to the VHS copies for a further 3 weeks to aid viewing.

I wrote to a prospective customer of the OALDCE 3/e Electronic on 19 May and faxed to you his letter in which he asked for a copy of the tape suitable for running on an AT&T machine.
Specifically, their letter stated: ‘We need a UNIX version tape for AT&T UNIX System V release 2.
The tape should be 1600 BPI with straight ASCII files.
Ideally, a streamer tape version (using ‘tar’ or ‘cpio’) would be preferable.’
Can you please let me know what problems this might present?

Dear Mr Steinhausen
I have learnt of your work via my colleague in Hong Kong, Fiona Lauder, who says that you would be interested in contributing a script which could fit into our Resources Books for Teachers series.
While this series is not my responsibility, it seems to me that our interest could be more easily excited in trying to apply your ideas to video and computer software than in text describing them.
That said, the whole area of interactive video — if that is indeed where your proposal lies — is so far from being a developed market that we are looking at it only in the most tentative of ways.
Perhaps the best way of going forward would be for you to send me a description of your work.

Thank you for your letter of 9 June.
On the matter of OALDCE 3/e Electronic and availability on your campus, the ball is currently in my court.
I am taking one final bit of advice before I bat it back to Noel Wilson in the Computing Service, and I imagine we will have reached some conclusion to the game before the end of June.
It is certainly good news that it will be so conveniently placed for you.
I will certainly keep you informed about the corpus project.
I hope we have succeeded in appointing a Project Manager and will be able to get him here to start work sooner rather than later.

Noel Wilson Computing Service University of Essex Wivenhoe Park Colchester CO4 3SQ
Dear Noel
OALDCE 3/e Electronic
Thank you for your letter of 19 May and I apologise for having taken so long to reply.
Your redraft of the contract was a most helpful way of approaching the issues — and in fact set out things more clearly than our original.
I have two trivial comments and two substantial ones.
The first first:
1 Clause 1: With the definition of ‘The Search Software’ I would like to maintain the wording of our original and continue if with ‘made available here by permission as dedicated software, and indices.’
2 Clause 11.4: This should, please, read as our original Clause 6e.
And now the substantial points:
3 Clause 2 para 3
a) It seems to us that for you to incorporate the Data (and I am presuming it is only the Data and not the Search Software) into your On-line Public Access Catalog system is going beyond the research use for which this special release of OALD 3/e Electronic was intended.
You implicitly recognize this:
i) by offering us £200 instead of the £100 asked, and
ii) by seeking to exclude the duration provision (see point 2 below).
Page 2
Forgive me, but we don't think £200 is proper recompense for the use of the dictionary and our name.
Putting a value on this kind of thing is a notoriously difficult area and one where few precedents exist.
(In this particular area of using dictionaries in catalogue systems, the only precedent of which I am aware is of a university paying something in the region of $40–50,000.)
Our tariff for an application of the kind you propose would be £2,500.
Further, if you wished to sell your Opac on to other libraries we would expect to bring Clause 5 into play and acquire a share in any profits resulting from such sales.
b) We would expect to maintain the duration clause in the contract for this additional application although we would accept a qualification along the lines of’…
Renewals for further periods of three years will not be unreasonably refused where the Data has been incorporated into composite works which the Licensee wishes to maintain.’
Please do contact me if you want to talk about any of these points.
I am out of the office next week but shall be available from 26 June onwards.
Yours sincerely

Dear Terence
Many thanks for your letter of 18 May, which i received on my return from Montreal.
It was very nice to see you again and talk over ‘self-access’ and developments in in-company language training.
I have discussed the two proposals concerning ‘Dialaphone’ and the ‘Schenker Method’with Simon Murison-Bowie.
The feeling is that our resources at the moment are rather stretched with existing projects to allow us to get involved with these very interesting, but, in the case of ‘Dialaphone’, rather specialized publishing proposals.
If however, you did go ahead with revamping the Schenker Method or developing something along similar lines, I would be interested in seeing sample materials.
We must keep in touch.
With best wishes.

Dear Mr Shipton
This letter is to let you know our intent subject to contract to draw up a publishing agreement for the components of Project Video Level 1.
These are the Activity Book and the Video Guide.
In anticipation of the agreement we would like to offer you an advance of 500 on signing the contract and a further advance of 500 on receipt of the manuscripts judged by us to be acceptable, both sums to be set against royalties.
Our agreement would propose a royalty of 8% of our receipts on each written component.
In the event of substantial revision being necessary to the manuscripts, we reserve the right to revise this royalty figure.
I should mention that if, for any reason, we did not go ahead or had to withdraw from publication, we reserve the right to give you adequate notice of our intention.
Any advance paid, however, would be irrecoverable.
This is standard practice, but such an event is unlikely.
I understand that it would be possible for you to supply us with the manuscripts by the end of August this year.
I hope this proposal is satisfactory to you.
If it is, could you please acknowledge this by signing and returning the attached copy of this letter.
Arrangements for payment of the advance can then be made.

This letter is to let you know our intent subject to contract to draw up a publishing agreement for the components for the Central News I and II videos.
These are Activity Book 1 and Activity Book 2.
In anticipation of the agreement we would like to offer you a fee of 2,500 for Activity Book 1 and a further 2,500 for Activity Book 2.
We could offer you an advance of 1,000 and the rest on satisfactory completion for Activity Book 1, and the same arrangement for Activity Book 2.
The total fee of 5,000 is in outright purchase of the copyright of the material.
This is on the understanding that it is you personally who will be preparing the material.
If, in order to keep deadlines or for any other reason, you wish to engage the services of a co-author, you must satisfy us that any contributions made by the co-author will be of a similar standard to those made by yourself.
This will probably best be done by your clearing with us beforehand the person whom you intend to subcontract but this would in no circumstances limit our right to make overall judgements on the acceptability of the scripts before making the second payment.
I hope this proposal is satisfactory to you.
If it is, could you please acknowledge this by signing and returning the attached copy of this letter.
Arrangements for payment of the advance can then be made.
Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Wallis
I would like to ask if it might be possible for Oxford University Press to make use of the track Message in a Bottle by Police in a non-broadcast educational video.
The programme is titled Project Video and will be distributed on cassette to secondary schools worldwide for use in teaching English as a foreign language.
Project Video is provisionally scheduled for publication in September 1989 and we anticipate sales over the first three years to be in the region of 2,000 cassettes.
We would like to make use of the tracks during a sequence in the programme where music is heard coming from a car radio.
We would anticipate using between 30 and 60 seconds of the song.
I would be extremely grateful if you could let me know if we are able to make use of the track and if so, what the cost would be.

Status of Music Permissions
1 Walk of Life (POLICE) Permission given: PolyGram are sending us a standard license to use, and will charge 50.
2 Waterfront (SIMPLE MINDS) Virgin Records to advise position after referring the request back to the artists (21/6).
3 I Like Driving in my Car (MADNESS) Virgin Records to advise position after referring the request back to the artists (21/6).
4 The Chocolate Girl (DEACON BLUE) CBS Records have a problem with giving permission for a video for world sale.
They would charge £5000 (!) and, because it is for educational purposes, would provide no restriction on sales and extend copyright for a period of 5 years (21/6).
5 Message in a Bottle (POLICE) Virgin are referring this back to Sting's office for confirmation of permission.
They are likely to want a sum of £250 for the use of the song, but permission also needs to be sought from A&M Licensing if you intend to use Sting's recording of the song (they may want a fee too!)(21/6).
6 Chattanooga Choo-Choo (GLEN MILLER) SBK own copyright which is administered by MCPS.
We need to sort out which recording we want to use and MCPS will talk with SBK to decide on a fee.
7 Hi Ho!
Hi Ho!
It's off to work we go!
(DISNEY) Chapel Records to advise position (21/6)
8 The Ride of the  Valkyrie (WAGNER) We need to decide  whose recording you want to go for.
9 The Star Spangled Banner (SOUSA?)
Again, same as 8.
10 Soviet National Anthem (SOVIET ARMY BAND?)
Same as 8, if we can find a recording!
11 Raindrops keep Falling on my Head (SASHA DISTEL) MCA Records to advise position (21/6).
12 Choral Music (??)
You were going to think about this one.

Overseas' Duplication
We have recently begun to license overseas distributors of our materials to make local duplications of a variety of ELT videos, including A Weekend Away, A Week by the Sea and Mystery Tour.
The first market we have allowed to do this is Argentina.
It is necessary for us to settle on a royalty rate for overseas duplication of titles, and it is this I am now writing to you about.
(I refer to your contract of 30 March 1987, clause 3, for A Weekend Away and A Week by the Sea and of 17 June 1988, clause 1.1 c), for Mystery Tour.)
I am afraid that the local production — certainly at this early stage — is only in low numbers, so there won't be any massive sums involved, but in view of this, and to settle the negotiations as soon as possible, I suggest setting a flat rate of 7% on all three titles involved.
I  would be grateful if you could confirm your acceptance of this proposal, and I will take necessary steps here to pay you the first overseas royalty.

Further to my letter of 19 May I have now heard from colleagues at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who have been instrumental in preparing the tape and are the owners of the copyright of PAT, the accessing software.
None of the versions we have will run under System V/2, and we would therefore have to arrange for Waterloo to port the code to run under your operating system.
For them to know whether they can do this, they need to have full information on the hardware you are using.
Could you therefore please let me know?

Thanks for your fax of 26 June.
I spoke to David on the phone yesterday and he, too, has been able to do very little because of not being able to get into Tim's program, like everybody else.
I have, as a result of the new storyboard, got a detailed list of proposals and suggestions from the new programmer which I am faxing to you (eight pages to follow), and which will form the basis of formal discussions between the programmer and myself and possibly David, and from which we have to derive a proper technical specification.
All in all David and I agreed that not enough work has been done to merit the meeting in Barcelona in the week beginning 10 July.
A meeting should in fact wait until we have a program and some sort of corpus for it to port on and for you to have to hand while drafting the handbook.
As soon as I can I will tell you when this might be so that we can fix up a time.

Overseas' Duplication
You will, I think, know that since we began publishing videos we have resisted issuing licenses permitting their duplication by overseas distributors.
Matters of control, both quality and quantity, have been as important as income.
There are emerging, however, a few bona fide cases where licensing is the only means of making any sales and where it is in our general interest to be in a market in anticipation of that market situation easing at a later date.
Argentina is a case in point.
It is necessary for us to settle on a royalty rate for overseas duplication of titles, and it is this I am now writing to you about.
(I refer to your contract of 30 March 1987, clause 3, for A Weekend Away and A Week by the Sea and of 17 June 1988, clause 1.1 c), for Mystery Tour.)
I am afraid that the local production — certainly at this early stage — is only in low numbers, so there won't be any massive sums involved.
In view of this, and to settle the negotiations as soon as possible, I suggest we ignore the principle of a rising royalty and set a flat rate of 7% of our receipts on all three titles involved.
I would be grateful if you could confirm your acceptance of this proposal by signing the attached copy of this letter and returning it to me.

2 On receipt of this letter signed and endorsed by you, we will pay you £1,000, and on receipt of the satisfactory script for Activity Book 1 we will pay you a further £1,500.
On receipt of the satisfactory script for Activity Book 2 we will pay you £2,500.
This total fee of £5,000 is in outright purchase of the copyright in the material.
3 This agreement is on the assumption that you are the owner of the materials, and that in the event of your employing a third person or persons to provide part or the whole of the materials, that the copyright of those materials have been assigned to you.
4 If, in order to keep deadlines or for any other reason, you wish to engage the services of a co-author, you must satisfy us that any contributions made by the co-author will be of a similar standard to those made by yourself.
This will probably best be done by your clearing with us beforehand the person whom you intend to subcontract but this would in no circumstances limit our right to make overall judgements on the acceptability of the scripts before making the second payment.
5 We will acknowledge your authorship by including your name on each of the books.
6 You accept that in making amendments or alterations to your scripts, in designing any illustrations and in manufacturing the books we are using our best efforts and knowledge of the market and you consequently waive your moral rights in these matters.
I hope that this proposal is satisfactory to you.
If it is, could you please acknowledge this by signing and returning the attached copy of this letter, and by also signing the enclosed document, retaining the copy for your files.

Work in Progress Records
We don't seem to have made much progress on this front so I have drawn up a set of forms myself, one for books, one for videos and one for software.
I attach blank copies of each together with some experimentally (and possibly inaccurately) filled in.
Please try to fill in this form for all titles you are responsible for and use this as an exercise to test its viability before we have Phil do something more elegant.
(It is important to remember that the purpose of these records is for internal progress checking, not for circulation to Area Managers or whoever.
They should be useful, however, when we are asked to produce lists of new titles for catalogues, budgets, etc, as a first point of reference.)

Many thanks for your fax of 1 June.
I indeed had a very pleasant and useful trip to Montreal.
It was a pity that there was not time to come to Toronto.
I am sorry not to have replied to your fax sooner but I passed it on to the wrong person for answers to your questions on promo videos.
It should have gone to Penny Naylor our new head of Publicity.
The two sample cassettes you ask about, Business Assignments and Mystery Tour are, or will be available through Penny.
The former is not yet available, this one and that for the Grapevine video will be prepared this summer and should be available during September.
We will keep you informed.
Specifically on the Concordia materials, there will be a sample video prepared once we draw near to publication.
In general, sample cassettes are available for all video titles, and I suggest that you contact Penny Naylor to place an order for these and for publicity leaflets too.
You raise the possibility of a continuous loop presentation video: the idea is not a new one but has been put aside for the moment because of the high costs involved in making such an item.
We will review the decision on an annual basis as our video list grows — maybe producing a series of loop tapes each one covering a particular sector of the market so that customers interested in adult/business English videos don't have to sit through a section on ‘watch with mother’ levels.
Sample disks for CALL are under discussion but will not be possible until the products are ready.
All the best.

Dear André
OALDCE 3/e Electronic
Thank you for your letter of 22 June.
Under our agreement with Waterloo University, where the accessing software, PAT, was developed, we are able to distribute only a limited number of copies of the tape for research purposes and we have nearly reached our ceiling.
I wonder, therefore, if I could ask you to take only one copy — would it be for the IBM/CMS or the Sun/3 with UNIX configuration?
We will also need to know the tape density you would prefer.
In the hope that this will be agreeable to you I am sending you by post  two copies of the agreement we would wish you to sign.
I would be grateful if you could arrange for clause two to be completed and initialled and the documents signed and returned to us for signature on behalf of the Press.
I will then return one copy for your files when I have the tape ready for despatch to you.
Yours sincerely

Dear Michael
Thank you very much for sending us the samples of prints from the English In Focus video taken from the Sony UP 5000 video printer.
We have looked at these carefully, but feel that even with careful selection and improvement in proficiency with the equipment they would still not be good enough for reproduction.
We have decided to go ahead and use an artist to redraw from prints.
Could you, therefore, please send us prints of the 59 stills used in the manuscript of the Student's Activity Book?
We can pass these on to the artist.
Robert Maidment is away at the moment editing a video.
On his return at the beginning of July, he will be able to get in touch with you regarding the final video edit.
I would be grateful if you would pass on a copy of this fax to your colleagues Dr Potvin and Susan Parks for their files.
Many thanks.
With best wishes.
Yours sincerely

Guess who's on the fax…
For the whole of next week Vicki Hollett will be on (0225) 448148 (day), and (0225) 29717 (evening).
I've received the second half of BB's script and have sent a copy on to her in Bath.
I understand you're meeting with her on Friday next week.
Cd you confirm your diary for next week with me some time?
Jonathan Crowther is trying to sort out the OALDCE launch video for the AMs' visit in July.
He has two VCs, one from each of the two cameras, and he'd like to pare this down to a 5 min promo.
He's going to go through the tapes and pick the bits he'd like to use on Monday next week (with a stop watch to get an idea of the bits he's interested in) and will book into the OUTC studio on George Street (278802) during week you're away (1 day's booking max), expecting some help from Astrid/Simon/anyone else who's around.
It's only for use in house at this stage.
As I mentioned on the phone yesterday: update on music permissions that have developed since last week: Waterfront (Simple Minds)(confirmation awaited from artists) and I Like Driving in my Car (Madness) will be £75 each for 3 years' world license, excluding USA.
Message in a Bottle (Police) will be £150, and acknowledgement on cassette box.
(I'll write to Virgin and offer credit on video end and in book — OK?)
Otherwise, situation as stated on mine to you of 22 June.
General admin: Preferred Working Hours are being updated for the Division: yours I've not changed but I have put Astrid's at 9.30 to 5.30 with 1 hour lunch.
Could you please explain to her what these are/mean and let me know if she wants to change them from this: needs to be finalized by lunchtime tomorrow.
PV AB schedule (and publicity in general) meeting 9.00 on Tuesday next week.
John Raby would like to clarify what's happening on Thursday next week.
You need to take your own equipment.
Next group meeting arranged for 26/7 and the following points apply to your area: closure of NLCs (AWA is only one closed); props/costumes return to Press for store/sale; space in general; equipment security.
Next Wed's possible visit to London — there'll probably be a train strike that day, so maybe we should think of alternative ways of getting whatever it is you want me to bring down to you on another day?
Finance are asking for your overseas' expenses for Greece…

Management Fees for SM-B
We've received a credit note for Simon's management fees for 1989, which amount to DM 40.000.
I think that normally there is a cheque sent through with the notification, which we put in against the COUP's fees code, but there isn't one this time.
Can you please let me know if there's a reason for this, like a new system of automatic credit or something?
If not, can we trace the cheque??!!
Regards
VAW
