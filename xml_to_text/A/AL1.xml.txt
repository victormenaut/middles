Letter to the Editor: Benign presence in Holy Week
SIR — Perhaps it is not for me, as a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church, to comment on ‘the precise purpose’ of Cardinal Hume's visit to Moscow (report, April 16).
But such a visit hardly needs a precise purpose to be fruitful.
The very fact that the visit is ‘in an entirely private, unofficial capacity’(the Cardinal's words to me last week) is more likely to have some beneficial effect in the ‘diplomatic minefield’ to which your correspondent refers than the more usual protocol-and-agenda-laden expedition.
In the aftermath of the Orthodox Church leaders' summit in Istanbul last month, when the assembled patriarchs spoke — as much in sorrow as in anger — of the proselytism addressed at their flock by what was carefully described as ‘certain elements’ in the Catholic Church, the mere presence of so benign a Catholic as Cardinal Hume in Moscow could well encourage local Catholics and Orthodox alike to reassess any confrontational attitudes to one another and to concentrate rather on their common ground, thus furthering mutual respect, concern and understanding.
This kind of understanding is difficult enough to reach on paper, as the (suspended) Orthodox-Catholic dialogue commission has been finding.
It is even more difficult to achieve at grassroots level, especially in those minefields with which both parties are well provided in countries such as Ukraine.
At all levels of church life there is an urgent need for role-models to encourage even the most prejudiced and most embattled to rethink their ways.
Too often it is forgotten that these should be ways of love and concord.
All the more reason to welcome this private visit as it permits the cardinal to provide such a role, though he would be reluctant to accept, or even to anticipate, his casting in it.
