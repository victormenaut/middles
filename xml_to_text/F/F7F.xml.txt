Aha  and that gets rid of it from the front page.
Sorry Rod, do you want me to
No, it's okay  er, just carry on cos I'm just looking for a piece of paper to write it on.
the  was that the first one was  was more or less science orientated an I I, I looked at it and thought how how I could  how I could make it  such that it was common
Yep.
er, so that Angela could use it you know.
Erm  and I came up with this bit, sort of the middle bit, national curriculum levels  would be  er  your own thing  right?
That wou tha that bit would be  erm  different for each subject.
The middle bit
Yeah.
whereas 
These?
the top bit and the bottom bit with the  at all 
Mm mm.
and the format would be the same and you just have different  names on the top here
Yeah.
so it would be the same sort of format.
And if you didn't want to  do national curriculum levels or it wasn't appropriate  then you could continue your staff comment now  or you could  draw a wee picture there or something like that, you know?
Yeah,and comments.
Er, the first thing is I put on the top of my draught that I'd rather the pupils weren't involved at this stage  I'd rather they were involved in the over view with form tutor.
So I, I wouldn't have taken, make a pupil comment on that section.
I'm not very happy with my box!
Why what's wrong with it?
Well, the first one 
You mean, you're on page two now?
Yes.
Right.
Well can we not talk about page one first?
Can can we to some 
Yes, alright then.
ignore page two because it's the next stage on, in fact,yo because it's a summation sheet isn't it?
Mm.
Alright?
We're actually at the moment the the the brief, the focus is to actually on what we, look at what we would send out as a report to parents.
That performs a second function
That's, that's the report at the end of .
Right, it's 
Mm.
if you like, that summate sheet
Correct.
alright?
So can we just ignore that for the moment and focus on  the first sheet deliberately 
It's not difficult 
Yeah.
Mm.
Because I think it gives us  er  it's got a lot of common things in, it gives us a baseline to work on
Mhm.
as opposed to be airy fairy!
Cos that was the problem last time wasn't it, we weren't quite sure
Mm.
where we were starting from and I think it would be valuable to do what we started doing  and actually to look at this as the baseline and decide how we might amend it  to keep common factors in  that we can all use, because we need something that has  a common denominator level 
Mm.
in.
Is that, is that 
I did that, I did that with .
Right.
You 
Mm.
one of the things you said, Angela was that there wasn't enough  comment on the original one, wasn't 
Aha.
enough room  so I  the size of that because of that 
Yeah.
more room  
But I've , what I'm saying Rod is I've done the same thing 
Sorry Angela!
because
Yeah, I'm trying to put the excuse 
I haven't been I haven't presented it as well Don has.
Right.
But I've done a generalised thing that could be adapted.
Right.
I think this is very good one!
Ah oh  yeah, I like that, I like it, yep!
Erm, just picking little bits, I mean  er,we when we say actually what it is  erm, annual report do we say the annual report to parents, or is it annual report just  I know that that's minor  but  at the actual top what do we actually call the thing that we're presenting?
I think, I, I would actually prefer to leave the word annual out and just put  I dunno what you wanna call it, I'd I'm always 
 
edgy about the word report  
Well Ralph Gardener 
Yes.
Community High School, yeah.
It will be Ralph Gardener Community High 
Yeah.
School that's the first thing.
Yeah.
Do we need to put on what it is?
I mean, is it not almost explanatory?
Yes, we  we do need to put it on.
We do need to put it on.
I'm looking for Bill, is he around anywhere?
Bill?
P E. 
P E.
And they're in room one which is down past 
Okay!
wherever something!
In the past we've used different  terms haven't we?
We we we went to statement to parents!
Refuse and this,tha you know!
To deliberately move away from the idea of the old reporting format that's why we've used the word statement to parents.
I mean that box on the left hand side there could be Ralph Gardener Community High School  and where it says science or maths or whatever
Yeah.
above that could be  report for  and then  science   you know?
What's wrong with just a title, science or
Oh okay then!
It seems quite clear I thought 
I wo I understand that you preferred the word report to be there?
Well ah, no!
Didn't say the word report
Sorry!
No, he didn't say that, no.
I think that an indication of what the sheet is
Yes.
for the benefit of
Mm.
whoever might pick the sheet up.
So, Ralph Gardener Community High School, hyphen  and, I would say annual out because 
Mm.
Mhm.
it might well be 
May not be annual!
Right 
Mm.
Mhm.
and we either go with the word report or we look for an alternative word  or words.
What is  what is the, what is the, is assessment not the word to use these days?
Mm.
No, it's not a report is it?
cos if we're reporting, we're not assessing.
Mhm.
It is a report to parents and I mean, under legislation we have to  report 
report 
to parents.
Well I mean I I was 
That's  
just looking at that one where we said  well report to parents 
Annual report to parents , yeah.
you know, and is that  is that satisfactory?
Well that  
Or do we want to call it something different?
In that case should call it  subject report?
Subject report instead of annual  got enough space in there  only make it small.
Do we need subject report in if you're going, I'm sorry if we're spli , if you're gonna have a box with you're subject name in?
Cos it's obvious
Mhm.
that it's a subject report, if you've got report
Yes.
right, says science or art and design or whatever
Well just put report!
Report will do.
And leave the title next to it.
Yes.
Yeah.
okay.
But will the 
Altho , although if one is  eventually going to talk about the  report  one could  to make it clear to the parents that  what one is a  subject report and the other is a  summate report.
Mhm.
Er, therefore  make a  distinction between the two  parts of the report,
You mean rather then the , the  report?
No, I think
Mm mm.
Ah!
We a we no 
 
we agreed, we agreed a on a fi 
We need to shift to  to the procedure that we would probably have  and a tell me if I'm wrong  I thought there was a sort of  general agreement without it being  sort of firmly agreed  that we were going to go for a format of  subject specific reports  still coming to form tutor who would complete some sort of general report, is that
Yes.
not what we had in mind?
And that general report would be in a sense a summate report or a form tutor report or a  er, pupil management report, whatever title 
Mm.
it is we're gonna 
Mm.
use.
Mm.
So is is that the context of the word report Andrew, er, that you're using.
Well  my feeling was that we had agreed  that the parents would sent the subject reports
Yeah.
where they never have been sent before 
Yes.
as well as the summate report.
Oh yes!
Yes , yes they would go as well I'm not 
Yeah 
saying
alright, yes 
that would go as well!
Well I think that's  certainly  
And on that basis  I'm not sure we need subject report in
 
just a  report and subject in the box.
Perfect , perfectly logical that!
Yeah?
Mm.
But as a necessary  
But we would still have a form tutor input i.e. a summation 
Yeah , but
some chance for the youngster in a 
but yo 
with records of achievement i.e.  
But do you agree that  that everybody in each subject should fill in that?
Something like that.
Oh well wait till you get 
 
round to that, we sti 
Really?
Yes, oh yes, I think that should 
I mean, it's a , it's the  
be summarised in the form of some sort of
Giving what we're being asked to do we do need to have something that focus on general skills and abilities, we've gotta decide what they are.
Mm.
But, yes, I agree we need something like that.
But the big problem at present is that that form tutors get loads of information sent to them  and then they
have to  
summarise it, and an awful lot of what has been done by the subjects
It's wasted,
It's just wasted the form teacher!
Right, if this is going on 
just keep it!
we said the last time, did we not?
That if this is going home then that sort of thing doesn't need to come from a form tutor, other than a sa er  a sort of generalised one as well, if you like.
Aye, it's the form tutor one needn't 
Mm.
needn't be, I mean once they've got all of this  the form tutor one needn't be anything .
The form tutor can well can build in a lot of good practises that have been built in
The the form I se 
over the years.
I'm I'm
I see the form tutor one  as being  now we've got hold of record of achievement as being part of the developmental process of a record of achievement, now our youngsters know what a personal statement is, form tutors are happier with a joint statement  it's taken us  four years 
Three or four
three four years to get there  but it strikes me that we can actually start moving towards that process, not a full sheet of a personal 
No.
statement, but we can start moving towards a personal statement
You can  
right the way across the school so we've actually got a standardised  format 
 
and everybo everybody's involved in it all the way.
And there's still no reason why in that sa er, joint statement that our subject reports
No.
to them  needn't be a, er a starting point, a key  for discussion between 
Absolutely!
the child and the tutor.
I mean you could have, if you have basically what we're saying is that you have a whole load of of subject reports and on the top of it you've got form tutor report 
Yes.
which is 
 
basically  er  a summary of   
A positive comment, an overall positive comment  based on all 
Su sa 
the other reports.
summarising wha , the same sort of thing as they're gonna get in the fifth year of the   
That's right!
to build up maybe  you know, individual statement, joint statement  perhaps on on the sheet 
But it allows 
Mm.
in keeping with, it allows that opportunity as you know 
 
as a form tutor, somebody's been on  a a a residential weekend 
Mm.
to include  the other things that we've done, so all I'm 
 
trying to say is, it's in keeping with the philosophy of records of achievement.
That's right,, yes!
Their, their, their out of school activities
Yeah!
anything like that.
But but, you should also be be sure that the form tutor  pro can clarify things for parents because  although, no no matter how hard you try to make this  erm, a clear and easily understandable document  it's only clear and un easily understandable to us.
Yes, but all form tutors are gonna have to become aware of each subject's
Cos they're gonna be   
you know they're gonna be 
they are
they're gonna be summarising them  a all the 
They are.
time
That's right.
and hopefully it's not gonna change!
No, and it'll make it a lot easier for  the form tha these are the same format
Mm.
So that they can do that 
 
quickly and easily
Mhm.
and make it easier for the parent to understand  whether this is good or bad.
Ah yes, it's just gotta the 
Well I don't think, they don't 
that choose 
 
but sometimes
that change.
parents have come to me and said  so and so's only got a C, it's appalling!
I think , I think that's very well laid out, I think that's quite  self explanatory to
Er, for us it is, yes but 
I think I think it's 
Oh yeah!
reasonably clear for parents actually.
I I think  one of the other points 
Makes sense.
Quite a lot of parents.
Quite a lot of parents.
Yeah, okay.
One of the other points about it is that it will erm  er, in in the minds of the parents the they will see this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten  er being used, poor, satisfactory, excellent and it will get them into the idea of what these levels 
Mm.
are.
Yes.
And they will therefore be able  providing it's  it's used in that format
Oh yeah.
it will be able to interpret for them what these numbers mean in the middle bit.
Mm.
Mhm.
Don, do you envisage the er  the general skills and abilities being done by pupils or  pupils and staff together or 
I thought, I I well, I don't envisage anything but I mean  I would of thought that kids could fill it in in pencil and then we do the same as we did before a and and that the staff in some way put in their own.
Mhm.
Ca can we just look at a  I don't know which way to to be specific or to look at the general first, can I just 
 
a make some general comments about  the, I mean I like that  we talked about that before, I like the ten levels
Yes.
I think we need to bla , talk about what the general skills and abilities are.
Mm.
I wonder about the pupil comment being divorced from the staff comment  I wondered whether they  one should follow the other.
I would rather not have that on the subject reports but if it's going to be on i for the sake of coherence the comments should be together.
Mm  you see I I it's it's trying to find the balance isn't it?
I I'm  er ah  I like to think that the youngsters have actually got some input into the report, I think it's important 
Yes, I'm not saying deny that
but at the same time  I would want to afford er, you as heads of departments  er er everybody's heads of department a little bit of leeway what i what if, what  wa wa we have to be careful about this that we set a standard  but allow a little leeway  because all departments are slightly different and want to approach things
Mm.
slightly differently and  what I'm trying to say is I don't want the leeway to weaken the strength of the reporting do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Mm.
And if you don't feel that you can fit in a pupil comment, you have to be very careful here because some people will take it as a cop-out and not do it  and a that worries me and it has happened  and I think it is important that the youngsters are actually given some guidance and the opportunity to do it.
You're 
Yes.
saying you're not in a position to do that in the moment or you wouldn't want 
No.
to do that?
No, I'm not saying that, I've 
Have I got the wrong end of the stick?
I'm not saying it like that, what I'm saying is I would pref , yes, I would like them to be involved in it  a as far as my subject reports are concerned I would like our reports that we do, we do involve the kids, I pass them out, we discuss them and I'll re-draft  but I would not, rather not have their written sample on that piece.
Okay.
I think they get fed up and I don't think that a that language-wise they have the vocabulary in the school to be able to pluck out meaningful comments and  you know, and go right across the curriculum there  I think 
 
dif let me finish!
Mm.
Er, it's difficult for them.
Erm, I think you should involve them but I think it'll be preferable if it was one to one with the form tutor  i that time and the form tutor has taking an over-view
Mhm.
and they were taking over-view as well right?
Now that's what I'd prefer, but in every, you know the majority go against me and they want it in  a as I say I I would, I think that it'd be better placed at the top.
Guidance?
I prefer the pu pupil comment to be honest.
You would like the pupils to to make their own written comment in there?
I'd also like the national curriculum levels to come straight underneath course  one.
Yes.
You see I felt
Can we no ,ca 
Yes, comments together.
can we just come back to the pupil comment business, one thing at a time for a moment 
 
and can we try and get  how people feel 
the reason 
about whether they want a pupil comment in.
The reason I'd put pu pupil comment where it is, is because  so far as I was concerned the top half of that I was gonna, was gonna be filled in by staff  it is a report.
Mm.
That's the top part  the bottom part is open to negotiation  and that's why I've put them altogether at the bottom.
Well
Mhm.
Don  the staff comment one could come under the national curriculum levels  if you  
Yeah, you mean  out 
Yes.
outline  then that 
Yeah.
bit then staff comment?
Yes.
Can I come back to my original question, which was  yo 
Pupil comments.
you you want pupil comment 
Yes or no?
Paul?
Andrew, your thoughts?
Yes, if we didn't have pupil comment we would miss some absolute pearls like Mr  is a lying git!
And, you know  only I couldn't live without that!
What was that word?
Git!
You've convinced me Andrew!
Was that  
Is that 
Bet he  then!
is that, but you 
Has it?
but you do have to remember as I say 
I've got one I'll give you my book later on Angela!
 
you do have to remember at the same time that these documents would be going home and 
Aha.
there is  a a a level of er oh 
Propriety?
yes  that when you 
An appropriateness!
yes, that 
and 
we need to follow.
Oh.
I would hope that if, if a parent saw er that er somebody had had that sort of attitude towards the staff that
Mm.
the parent would have the opportunity of making an appropriate
Mm.
It's not only that but if if if 
No, it's not only that  
if they if they did this i would it not give them practise at  at being able to do the
Mm.
you know, the the report at the end of of, of five years?
You know
Angela's expressed a view.
I'm I'm saying the  but not just stage 
 
that's what all  
Chaps!
Oh, er erm  Alan, sorry?
Erm I'm  half and half I I I go along with Angela in the main that  the the kids in, generally speaking the kids that I've talked to  don't want to put their own input  a lot of them don't want to because, as Angela says, they cannot find the appropriate words  and some of the others just write some  some stuff that  I would look at 
 
and say I'm, you know I'm not very happy having that written on this.
I've had  
But it's 
science this year.
But with all due respect is some of that  not to do with the guidance their receiving from us as teachers?
Certainly, I I've told you 
Absolutely!
I have spent 
But 
a great deal of  effort and time  in enabling the children to write something meaningful
I  I've let it in 
Sure 
you know im im improve their English language.
Sure.
Okay, Paul?
Surely we've working 
 
from er statement banks for pupils for quite a long time  and why 
Can we 
can't we, why can't we be picking out  guiding, guidance as far everything 
Alright, I 
should be 
I don't have to look, if I can just 
It's all mechanistic to say that!
I don't have to look 
It's all what?
Mechanistic you know 
mechanistic  
Oh yes I feel  oh stop !
I don't have to look too far back in there when we started this whole process, four or five years of throwing it all up in the air  to say that  I felt every pupil could comment in some way, something that they had enjoyed, something they felt they'd been successful at, something they felt they found difficult, something that had pleased them, surely every child  could comment on wo , if it's just one of those things 
Wha 
but i it has then
And that's on every subject, that's the what Angela's, the point 
No.
Angela's making 
Yes  
I think 
it it be it becomes repetitive 
They  they get a 
Yeah.
bit sick of this 
Yeah.
you know!
Yo your 
It becomes stale, they say I like this  it was good!
Yes, I I I I 
And things like that.
But is that not part of our job to get them to think and ?
Yes, absolutely, I agree with you!
Obviously I agree with you that we should be putting the kids in challenging situations where that they've gotta rise to the occasion and use language in an effective way, but I don't know whether this is the best way, these er er er, you know, a series of how much space of you got?
Whereas, if they were involved in the end where they sat with the form teacher
Mhm.
read the lot, I mean, look what they doing language-wise, they're reading, they're evaluating, they're projecting  I mean,the that, they're doing quite complicated things there, and also hopefully there will be enough space where they  have the opportunity to put something that is meaningful  and they're involved in the dialogue with the form 
Right.
teacher.
Paul?
I I, for pupil comment you could ea , quite easily have a joint statement there, or a joint comment  whereby the  
Or just statement.
there's no 
Or just 
real reason why
comments.
once a year that er  a subject teacher and a pupil cannot sit down an and come up with a
Could 
I take  sometime.
Could we get round with that?
Could we get round that by, instead of saying staff comment and pupil comment  make the space 
Join them.
slightly larger and just say
Just say
statement?
Just say comment actually.
Comment.
Comments.
Mm.
Comments.
That's what
But I have to put back to you that the onus then falls on you and head's of departments to ensure that that space is used properly.
Oh it will be.
Okay.
Yes,that will.
And I have to say my experience it leaves me to doubt, I know I'm a cynic sometimes, that the space will  not be used effectively  and 
Well 
because people get under pressure and it's oh Christ I ain't got time so I won't bother!
I'm sorry 
Well that's 
if that's very cynical 
 
and I know it's unfair in some context.
It is 
Mm.
unfair!
Erm, I think that is unfair 
We 
Rod, yes I agree with Don, I think  if you look at er what the work has gone in er  in the fifth year for the last two or three years and the way that subject teachers are now approaching ranks of achievement  I don't see yes it's .
It's not a process wi , that's not a valid comparison in the sense that in 
No?
fifth, in fifth year and year eleven it's a different ball game altogether.
But why shouldn't staff  put the same process into operation lower down the school?
I think beca I think because some don't actually transfer the skill, if I might, say that.
Yes but I mean, in some cases I've gotta say in some cases it is inappropriate to make a lot of comments with 
Mhm.
a lot of pupils  you are giving a lot of information
Mm.
here and here on the pupil
Mm.
in some cases it may be appropriate  but if you're forcing people to make comments just  because there's a space to do it
Mm.
then it loses a lot of it's  values, yes.
Right.
But can't we think about re-phrasing that  so we get this idea of this joint statement, some sort of dialogue on 
Okay.
on there.
Co , more comments then?
Right.
I think that's a point to pick up on actually.
Mm, I
Andrew?
On this?
I'm never never one for for making work  but  on an a on  although this isn't going to be called an annual report  for most children it will be an annual event  and  I do feel  quite strongly that  for the child to be able to  have the opportunity
Mhm.
of doing this  and the opportunity is one where they are told to do  and they will not miss the opportunity.
Well they're gonna 
Is 
be told to do that when they're doing this bit aren't they?
Mm.
When they're going to look 
Mm.
at this bit and tick these boxes
Yes, but ticky boxes, and expressing themselves in other 
Yeah but 
ways  the ways perhaps that  are not
Sticky!
erm  you know the, what they wish to express is not available on the 
Mm.
ticky boxes  erm 
That  sho sho should be there.
I know that  our children by enlarge  er  their vocabulary doesn't extend to  erm  what er, polysyllabic words which which might really sum up  for an adult what they've been going through, how they've enjoyed it  but  what is the terrible form we  had last year in seventh year, was it seven G ?
Yeah.
Erm, George and I had that class shared between us, he took them for an hour a week and I did  and i if there is a class that any of us had ever taken that would be unlikely to be able to write something meaningful of this kind
Mhm.
that would be the class and yet they all did  cos George and I insisted!
But we helped them by suggesting 
Mm.
words  and er, they didn't lose it  they, they they they went along with it  and they, they actually, some came 
Yeah.
up with some quite good descriptive language with some aesthetic terminology  which we guided them with, but we didn't put the words in their mouths
Mm.
each one  came out as a very personalised and individualistic comment which reflected that child.
Mm.
Some of them very negative, and how much they hated doing what they'd been made to do  er, and others  very surprisingly  made it known that they had thoroughly enjoyed it.
Erm, but the , they were totally honest they didn't feel 
Mm.
made to do anything else.
But 
I would not have known that children who said they enjoyed it, were enjoying it 
 
Mm.
cos they behaved so badly!
Mm.
And I hadn't enjoyed it !
Maybe that's why they enjoyed it Andrew?
Mm.
 
Perhaps it was , in fact, one or two of them said, you know  we like ripping the 
 
piss out of Mr !
I think you've also gotta look at it from the kid's point of view and perhaps I'm wrong here but, you know when you think, I mean,the these are going to be done very, you know er i i we got a sort of time limit, and kids are going to be told during perhaps a two week period
Mm.
right, science, right come on then let's get down to this!
Then they'll now go into a maths lesson  let's go into this, they're gonna perhaps do that eight times, then they're gonna get a breather, then a few days time after that the form teacher's saying right, let's do it again and summarise it, I think it's too much!
Right, well I I  part of me says,the the there are two aspects, the other side of the coin a little bit, if we talk about recording achievement and not recording failure, we here have an opportunity to point out to youngsters, encourage youngsters in that they are all capable of achieving in some way and to get them to write down  that they have achieved, that's the other side of the coin.
I know it happens in individual subjects and there's the element of repetition but, you are at the same time making them reflect over a certain period and say I have not entirely wasted my time, there maybe some youngsters for whom it will be extremely difficult, and I except that but my thinking is  that is you look hard enough you can find something that everybody has done at whatever level  that they can take some pride in.
Aha, and they can do that in the summary!
I agree with you but they can achieve that in a different form, if that's your purpose it doesn't need to be achieved like this.
Yes.
There is no reason why, why the teacher and the pupil shouldn't be discussing this bit of it!
You're going to give them more of a ri , a more of a resource bank, if you like, right to pu pluck these, er these comments from 
How will we class
if they take an 
if 
over view.
Right, if we don't do it that way how will we pass that information, which a a as I understand it you want passed to the form tutor?
Well it's go , it's all going to be there in the reports and surely the kids are going to able to form everything .
No it won't be on if if we use this as the document 
reports.
for science
No I don't  mm, yeah.
we're immediately saying now, well we need another sheet of paper because the information 
No!
that we're talking about
No  do that, right?
That's the only thing that's gonna be off, okay?
And then we as the form teacher sits  why can't the kids look at the reports as well?
But will the form teacher be able to do as you would do in English and say, but look when you did  that written piece on so and so it was goo, the form teacher will not have that detailed knowledge that you will have 
We'll give the kids some prompts  you know, what have you enjoyed?
What have  bla bla bla 
Angela I would have thought
er and involve that in part of the programme, you know, where they're, where they're involved in the whole report and assessment.
For for si for the six subjects?
Angela 
Form teacher wouldn't have time to do that!
No, no you do I'm not making myself clear!
That's why it should be done  in the 
No.
No, what I'm suggesting is 
lesson.
that the kids erm  as an alternative, the kids could get some help on how to, look at all the reports and extract a couple of positive statements that's what the emphasis should be, not that he's a git!
Right?
No nothing on that, that sort of line but you  
I think you're taking one example there actually Angela!
I think you're interrupting 
A 
me!
A , take a couple 
Yes, I am.
positive statements right and they need a little bit of help on how to do that and then make some sort of generalised positive comment about themselves, that's what I mean.
Mm.
So 
Or , or if that, if you disagree with that well, put pupil comment there, hyphen or whatever  upon  but lead that on, give them a bit of a leader into it.
Mhm.
Can I summarise?
Go on then.
We're getting nowhere fast
Well I ca 
I mean can we 
I think we are!
could I, could I make a suggestion?
No, that's important.
Could I make a suggestion?
Taking into account everything everybody said  the formats as it is, course outline  after course outline goes  your individual bit, right?
Subject, but national curriculum levels on this one
Yeah.
sta sta staff comment comes out of there  and that bit goes up  then you have general skills and abilities  and then below that you have a wider box  which just says comments  which will include  a staff comment  and may include a pupil comment as well cos because it's signed by both at the bottom.
Can I just check what you were saying there?
So, take the staff comment from there and instead of putting staff down put a generalised comment on this?
Just put instead of having staff comment and pupil comment, you got one box, comment.
Double the size of the box 
Comments.
down there.
Comments.
So that 
That would
that comes out 
instead of being  there 
Can I have a word please?
Mm mm.
It's down there.
Paul?
I'd like, I think as it is at the moment is erm  is superb!
And I think, instead of pupil comment it should be some sort of joint say.
But I think that's perfectly adequate.
And I think kids should be encouraged  to erm  think about themselves rather than just tick boxes  and I think er, er er a group of sentences down here written by the form teacher, by the  subject teacher and the pupil  erm, as it's been done for about, for a few years, a good  habit to get the kids into, erm  especially as a record of achievement should start from year seven.
Mm.
Can I just ask then, if you're saying to be it should be a joint statement, but you 
Mm.
think that format's alright, is that not a contradiction because  if it's a joint statement and this format's alright you've got staff comment  divorced from pupil comment?
I want the staff comment and I want the, a joint statement at the  at the bottom.
But I want your opinion, I mean the sa , the the staff comment is going to be 
Well you do exactly 
repetition!
you do exactly the same on the erm  on the record of achievement don't you?
You've got a a staff comment and then you have er  a pupil comment which is really 
Well 
written in as a 
No.
joint sort of 
No  no  you have a pupil statement  personal 
in the 
statement.
in the sa in the form, in the form  when the form teacher does it.
You have a personal statement then the joint statement.
You don't have a staff comment and a joint statement.
But the staff comment is in the statement
I , in the subject specific.
Mm.
Right.
So you wo you would like to have it in a format  similar to the  the very final
Yes.
thing that they're aiming at so
Yeah.
they get used to  the format?
Mm.
That's sounds very reasonable but I  I er I I ha not having been at the level, form  tutor
Mm.
but er  you know 
Yeah, I think 
for some years, I've never done one of those.
I take what Paul's saying, I think 
I'm not really with it.
I think there's a scale element  cos we're talking one sheet here and it's a  it's a much bigger exercise.
Okay right.
But I I I agree what you're saying, it's very valid.
Guidance then Paul?
Can , yeah, can we  can we vote on whether we're going to improve pupil comment?
And then when that's decided let's decide 
Well let's 
upon the format.
get dead clear about what it is we're go actually gonna vote on
Right.
because it's  we've gone a bi 
On the  
a bit round the houses.
Either in principle 
Am I right in saying then  i i is the first thing we need to agree on whether we're gonna have a staff comment, and a pupil comment  on there  is tha , is that the first decision?
I think everybody's in agreement about staff aren't they?
There's no question about staff comment on there?
No.
Right, fine!
Right.
Er , what do you mean there's no question?
Everybody accepts there should be a staff comment on.
Er, okay 
and it's sold!
Fair enough, well, that's the point I was making.
 
The  the the  in order to get by  pupils writing these er  rather immature things that they write on the 
Mm.
bottom of these reports why can't you make it into a  a pu er er  a a joint  teacher pupil comment, it isn't just a, it isn't in the same form it's just the same that the pupil writes that with guidance
with teacher guidance, sitting next to the teacher.
I think we're losing track  of what this actually is Paul, there are, you're trying to do two things at once what you're trying to do, I think  is use it as a learning process for children but  this is an annual report for parents  and I think that part of it a at least surely must be a report  by the sa member of staff, by the department on how the child has done, by the member staff.
By all means give the, give the kid a chance to, to put his side of the story if you like, but there must be  er 
Well we've got all that there haven't we?
Right.
Yep.
Yeah?
I know.
The the form that we have currently  the er  sta statements are they called at the moment?
Yeah.
Erm, I know that the way that I do it every time
it looks rather like a  is what we use?
Is that the one you want as a form tutor?
Er, it's subject 
Oh.
Then I haven't got a front have I?
That 
Er 
one?
Yes, it is there.
Yeah.
Er, the comment here  the way that I have been used to doing these  I found  that I I like it and the kids can
You write yours 
 
and they write theirs?
I I invariably do write something
Mm.
So do I.
and the kid invariably writes something down.
Well that's what I suggested ten minutes ago!
And I like that form.
Yes.
Whilst you've suggested everybody else has a right to their opinion and doesn't make yours  the solution!
And I think having, as a separate issue, the staff comment as a 
!
a separate box  er, you know, er is is is not necessarily appropriate.
Sometimes, if the child writes in there first  I say, I concur with what so and so has said, Well done or something like that.
Would
Sometimes the child isn't really very good at writing and I will write something encouraging  and the kid says I have liked my art  well, yeah
Can I, can I 
that's all they can do 
can I then  put to you 
in fairness.
I think, what Don's saying is 
It's got differentiation though.
that we have a comment area
Testing, testing, testing !
that we have a, differentiation he said,differenti 
Differentiation.
we have a 
Differentiation.
comment area  when we, these go out there would be guidance which would say their staff must make their comment  in that space
Yeah.
how  the other part of space is used could be left to individual departments on the basis that
Of discretion.
discretion or  it is hoped that pupils would be afforded the opportunity to make their own, if 
Involved in the process.
you wish so, they must certainly be involved in the process
Yes.
or it could be an agreed  joint statement and written by the member of staff.
Whichever way you are.
Oh  yeah.
So it allows
So what does that mean?
What you're saying is
basic comment 
yo you're gonna put comment?
We will put 
No then 
comment
call that statement then.
It's gotta have something before it though.
It's qui , comments!
Well 
Comments by who?
Well
Comments and statement?
Well, if you put comments  and 
Mm.
a me a member of staff writes the comment and signs it it's obvious who 
 
has written the comment, i.e. the member of staff has written it, you could then have something underneath if you wish to, that is the pupil's, that will be obviously the pupil's from the different writing, or the style of the writing  er  or you could open it up with we have agreed, if you wish to one  make it a joint 
Aha.
statement.
Aha.
And we would put that down  as basic guidance to staff when 
 
completing reports.
Yes.
Yes, yeah.
In other words it leaves  the  format open to the department concerned?
Let the cat in Alan 
But 
would you and I'll get the food, I'm a bloody expert  cats 
and that's, sorry, and they acted immediately there.
!
Terry, thoughts?
I mean, we've not sort of included you 
No I've  I mean, I know that in the primary schools nowadays they do allow, or do let the ki the children actually write their own reports as well.
Mm.
Cos they're actually coming up from  
 
this year
Mm.
I mean, they 
It's the  records of achievement.
so they're doing it from the age of possibly eight or nine some people, certainly down right the way through 
Mm.
the bottom of the school.
I've 
But I , I I still agree with 
It's young to be doing it.
what somebody said that the, sometimes the pupil's comments are kind of as Andrew pointed out earlier that er
Yes.
 
It's not the sort of things that 
but 
you wanna see on a  on a 
Yeah.
on a report, on a  
But I mean 
but with guidance
Yeah, yeah  
You see I 
That's right!
I agree with what you're saying but when I've done it before and involved the pupil in such a report I put it on a separate sheet, so that 
Yes 
there's been 
Yeah well that's what the primary school's done.
ma , this is prior to all this you see 
Yes.
Yes.
and we had all this we've got  
Ha I have to go along here some, to some of you with a bossy statement of you know, this inclusive as opposed 
Yeah.
to exclusive bit 
Mm.
Mm.
and it allows  the opportuni it affords the opportunity to be inclusive and I think that's important.
 
Well a po what about the reverse?
Sorry?
Put it on the reverse of the sheet.
We then get into all sorts of photocopying 
 
production problems, I mean this is why I was asking did you want another piece of paper?
I know it's a bit penny-pinching
Mm.
Oh!
but erm, because
Mm.
that's very 
But Rod, I I sti I think it is also is good preparation for year eleven.
Mm.
Oh yes!
that's a 
 
they should be thinking about it right from the word go.
Oh absolutely!
Yeah.
Absolutely!
As long it is joint, I mean there's no way that yo that you could  have something sent home to parents
Right,
with a kid's comment, maths is crap!
You know , yeah 
You know you would tear it up wouldn't you?
Ye well I would, yes.
Yes!
But so and lo , on the other hand though I'd 
But I I  go on sorry Paul  
a lot of the the statements these kids make are quite reasonable, well written comments
Yes!
Mm.
so wha what Andy's done, and what other people have done have pitted, picked out a few great examples, but I would say that erm  the majority are quite reasonable comments, if, if perhaps a little bit simple at times, I don't know.
Does seem .
Andrew?
I would , I would tend to say the majority aren't, aren't interested in their, in their own comments.
Erm, well 
But 
that depe , a lot of, sorry Rod!
A lot of that depends on on the, on the staff input
Mhm.
Mhm.
and how they  motivate 
In school 
the kids, as Andrew has pointed out that, as as he and George operate.
Last comment from Andrew and then we move on cos we've got a a an agreement in in what we're gonna put in, we haven't got an agreement as to where we're gonna put it but  Andrew comment?
Well I'm prepared to say th th that I that I think that we do do good practice  in that we do sit down with the children and help them, each individual along with the  with our joint statements.
Never the less, it is the child speaking we don't  put the words into their mouths  and as such when they speak and when they write it down, it's one of the, possibly one of the few chances of having primary evidence of how the child is at  er, writing  er, on an official document
Mm.
er, progressing through the years  I doubt whether samples of the child's work  are kept officially in any other form or anywhere else
They are.
their handwriting and so on.
They are.
Maybe they are in English but 
Mm.
but not an official document as opposed to a subject, I mean, I keep all their pictures, you know that 
Mm.
they do.
But it's a central 
 
a central
Mm.
easily accessible
Yeah, that's fair enough.
by anybody  form  so, here we have each year, six examples of the child's  writing and thought processes and opinions  at least, well I, I said six because I ca don't really know how many subjects a child will be  taking or writing for 
Mm.
but it is primary evidence and I think as primary evidence it has an extra value to the child's records, and to the school's records, over and beyond what
Mm.
we have ever had or thought about, practically.
On the other hand  each time they get a report they're going to have  ten pieces or their work  on each report
Right!
which I'd never have thought.
Tha , that is what,i isn't that what I just said?
Yeah.
Mm.
And then they're gonna have an eleventh one when they, when they do it with the form tutor.
The form tutor and .
Are they going to do with the form teacher 
Yes, once a year.
tutor as well?
Mm.
Well once a year but they never 
Yeah.
have to be a little parcel won't it?
Because we need to go through that 
An example   
summation joint statement process.
Can we run through 
 
this again then so we 
Right.
can decide?
Let's come back to it then, so we've agreed a basic heading, although we need to play with that a bit, name, year  tick indicates end of end of key stage
Ooh mm!
No, I'm not too sure about that!
We well 
Yeah ,tha that that's just  
Let's just leave it for the moment , let's just leave it for the moment.
Course outline  I think we're all agreed, should be at the top  er, that is important  we've now agreed a heading and comment  we've got a  e enough agreement that says that, it will be just called comment, but guidelines will need to be produced to go to staff  erm
Rod, is that national curriculum levels or  is that staff comment after course outline just there?
Well that's what I want to get from you now if I can.
Oh sorry!
Carry on.
We've agreed comment, where would the comment be placed, given that, I think we all agree we want national curriculum area in, we need a general skills and abilities in, where would the comment be situated, at the bottom underneath everything, between the two  or what?
A at the end of the main staff input.
Yes.
So that should go  there.
So are you saying 
with the suggestion
 
so as it sits now between national curriculum 
No, I'm asking you there but I'm asking you when's the me , end of the main staff input?
That's there isn't it because that's 
Mm.
supposed to be a joint activity there?
Mhm.
So I would suggest that it would go there.
So I would 
Between national curriculum levels and general skills and abilities as it sits at the moment?
Yes.
Mhm.
Course outline  national curriculum levels, staff comment.
Erm  I would differ er, with that opinion because I would say that the comment  as a joint comment  would erm  have to deal with the general skills and abilities 
Mm , oh yeah.
which the child er  erm, generally speaking does with, they're getting teacher guidance.
So, the comment, joint statement
Which refers to what?
Will be about everything, not just the top bit but would include comment of the whole 
for that.
Right, I  I'm sorry I didn't understand I thought that you 
That's okay.
that was gonna be a se separate 
No.
staff
No.
if it's a joint comment, yes it should go at the end.
So com wi th but we've agreed, I'm sorry if I'm being repetitive and boring and the rest of it but  comment, there would be a staff comment, how you use the rest of the space, assume there's a double space  is now left with you given the guidelines are issued.
Well we're gonna say staff comment are we?
Are we?
No, it would just be comments.
 
yes
Yeah.
And the first part of it that would be staff comments.
The first part of it must be a staff comment.
Right.
And 
And 
it will be double the size
Well it won't be double the 
it'll be 
size it'll be 
it'll be staff 
Yes.
comment plus, pupil comment 
Will it ?
so it'll be like 
Yeah.
that.
we will just put it as a space.
one big block.
So it'll be left up to the 
A space with 
individual
That's right.
It'll be as a space.
Okay.
So 
And is this, are are the I know this again 
 
just minor, but if the staff produces a comment  are they going to sign that and also sign the bottom or are we just gonna leave it that the parent will be able say 
I think it's pretty obvious who's written what.
That's what I'm saying!
Well is it?
I say,Ro Ro Rod, there's gonna be 
Yeah.
sorry, there's gonna be some people who don't even ha have no pupil comment on at all then?
They have no pupil input?
Course they will!
It will have 
Well no 
pupil input on that bit.
There's gotta be a pupil input, there's no way you can do this 
Why, why do you say that?
I'm just er interested, that's all.
So the 
No,the they'll be a pupil input, it might well be that as a department there's a decision that the pupil would not write 
Yeah.
on the report.
Right, okay.
But it does, you are not precluded from allowing a youngster to write on a report.
I'm I'm er er being a little naughty and trying to steer a middle road, if you like
In other words it could be  correct me if I'm wrong
I, what I don't, if  Andrew obviously feels he's got a strong process that suits him and I don't want to knock that on the head.
Alan, I'm sorry if I'm sort of trying to put you at the end and continue and I I don't intend it like that.
I don't mind, I just know 
Alan 
exactly where I stand on this!
Well Alan sort of has a feeling that he doesn't want that to happen  and I want to fi , I, what I don't like, I I mean I go , personally I go with Andrew's feeling but I don't want, so I don't want to exclude that again
Mm.
I want, I want if 
I want to do both.
to afford the opportunity
I
at the same time, there are people who sit in the middle ground
Mm.
and I think it's perhaps important to start with that we go with something that's a little bit open-ended that we can review in a years time er, perhaps a little bit later and say well look  we have shown that we can do it valuably er  the proof is in the pudding, it now beholds everybody to do it this way.
Yes.
Is is that, is that reasonable?
Yeah?
Agreed.
Yeah.
Right?
Grand!
Er, well I I don't want you to feel that that er maths department
No, I'm not saying 
don't want 
no.
pupils involved  because every piece of work that a kid does is discussed with the pupil  the only thing that I was  a little wary about was a pupil actually putting down  Mr  is 
Right.
a so and so, er maths is crap and so on and  you know, that's that's going to make  this into something that we wouldn't want
Right, I I I'm I'm 
anyone to go, you know to see.
I do apo I wasn't trying to put you as the bad boy  on that end of the continual, I wasn't Alan, I'm 
No.
We could be here for about
He's a bad boy !
So, so we're saying that there will be a staff comment, then there maybe nothing else  or there maybe a pupil comment  or there maybe a joint statement?
Mm.
That's right.
That's right.
So that's every system incorporated.
Staff comment followed by one
It's very vague though innit?
No.
Well it's not!
So we'll leave it and down three formats  possible.
mm.
And that's going at the bottom we're saying there right?
Mhm.
Right at the bottom?
Yep.
Yeah.
So that bit that goes there and that bit goes rou , put that back in again that's right 
Yeah.
bottom, it's gonna be called comment?
Mhm.
Mhm.
Are you gonna issue guidelines or just leave it?
Yep.
No, there will be guidelines  and you're in the know anyway so you'd be telling at your curriculum area meetings, you'd be saying 
Cascade 
as opposed to 
Cascade
Ca , oh!
But you're not going to 
Ca cascading!
Cascade!
Cascade!
But you're not going
You're no , not the sweat pouring off my brow!
No, but you're not going to  you're just gonna leave it open?
Yeah, for the reasons that I've said to 
You're going to
we can evaluate it later on a 
Okay.
without  you know, having to 
Well it's not that open because we're saying there must be some  staff  something written by staff
Yeah.
or are we not?
Oh yes we are aren't we?
Yes.
Staff have to write their comments
Ah
Something
there is then an option after that 
and involve the child.
as to whether it's a joint 
and involve them  they must be involved mustn't they?
I  I'm sorry I just take that as automatic, I don't even think about it any more.
I think you should write that down okay, that means pupils 
Well 
must be involved in in some form 
I I do and I don't that's your job is, can I be naughty, it's your job as cacs to insist that that's happening.
So you would advise, Rod that, you would
I I, no it's go er er  youngsters are involved in it, I mean that's just my assumption, it's our rationale, well it 
at the moment.
I don't know where the rationale is but it's written 
I'm 
that's it's everybody's responsibility.
Point the finger Paul, come on!
Yes.
I'm not into that Angela, I couldn't do that!
 
I can't honestly
Why?
They they are meant to do it and don't do it, they should be told to do it.
Mm.
By?
Exactly!
Mm.
Yes, but there is still the the the thought that   a me , I'm sorry !
A a a member of staff may feel that they want to say something about a kid, and it does not necessarily have to agree with what the kid
Here here!
That's right.
You know, I mean, I might be saying Jimmy  has wasted his time this year 
Oh yeah!
then he will have  under me have to say, Jimmy does not agree with this 
Yes.
he feels, and so on, but there has got to be something that is obvious staff comment.
Er
Yes, absolutely!
Well yes I, I put down comments like that 
and that is, that would be exactly the right way to do it!
that the kids don't agree with 
You say Jimmy 
I think it's this 
the I sa I put my reasons forward 
 
because Jimmy could then sign that  
and they're, they're they're still involved aren't they?
Aye?
 
 

Disagreement's involvement 
Mhm.
isn't it?
Yeah, I'm 
I mean the number of times, Alan, I've read quite a few 
Got your facts right!
I've come across  we agree  er, or Jimmy feels  now once somebody writes Jimmy feels it's, it's almost intrinsic that, is that the word I want?
That, there is da , yeah it's a word, there is disagreement.
I might be to you but it's this is going to a parent!
Yes.
I I I'd agree with Alan, I'd
Yeah, that's right.
I don't see that that pu that the the staff comment, which is gonna be the first thing  need have anything to do with the child at all there is ample place 
Oh 
if you think
within
Shoot that man!
Jesus Christ!
Well in the sense that  they've been involved in it.
No
No but the 
I don't they need to be involved in it whatsoever!
They've read what you've said  and then say well I don't agree with that and you can write down that.
Absolutely!
A staff comment is 
But surely that is involvement, I'm not understanding what you're putting forward!
No I think 
No.
it's the way the words have been used that we're interpreting wrong.
If I've got to write a comment for a start 
What sort of weasel word then?
then I want to write a comment, I will not necessarily involve the child with 
No.
what I'm writing  he will 
Er 
then see that, or he will have 
Mm.
already seen it because he will be involved in that bit.
Aha.
Yep.
Mm.
Well
But if she does see it
Well if she does see it, yes.
Yes, yes, she!
subtle ah?
Alright.
If she does see it and disagrees with it 
 
that's involvement isn't it?
Mm.
Yes.
Mhm.
We're agreed then.
Okay 
Might not agree with this  
I I I think we've  I think we've covered that.
Right.
I think  we've flushed that one haven't we?
Well I think so 
Well there you are!
I mean  I don't know how you
It's hard work this isn't it?
I need some tea !
Anyone need a cup of tea 
I I think 
on the  !
It's only half past two!
We've only been here three quarters of an hour !
Well we've got ten pages to do, we're only half way through the first page man !
No, we haven't , no we haven't we we're okay  because  
that have been there for years haven't they?
But it does need cleari , unless we get some sort of consensus, and it behove you to say look this is 
 
it's my belief but there are beliefs, I mean it does behove you to present 
Yes!
what other departments feel to your  to your people, because wha , you do have to be careful about the  indoctrination, this is what I believe so it's right, we've gotta  we do have to strike a balance.
I mean I've got my own thoughts, I have to be careful here that  you know  I've got to try and pull together what you think because at the end of the day it's it's very important that it reflects the way we work in school, not the way I perceive I we work in in school because you're the people at the chalk first.
I think a , that there's another point that we should all remember  and that is that it shouldn't just be our opinion either, we are  sort of told from high  certain things
By who?
that we have to do in a certain way, in a certain format and certain things have got to be included and we've got to take that in hand as well.
But we've done that in the brief that we've we've worked on.
Yeah, Oh no, I know, I know, I know!
We've already got past 
Yeah.
that stage.
Yeah, alright!
Fair enough!
I think haven't we?
But after what she said 
Sorry , I'm being defensive, sorry!
Mm.
Right  so we got staff comment, it will either be a pupil er, statement written by the member of staff  or written by the pupil themselves or a joint statement, they were the three 
Or  no on both.
On all three.
I it will be staff 
Did we alter it?
Yeah.
it could be staff alone, it could be staff and pupil, it could be staff and joint.
Okay 
the only thing it can't be just 
But they're going to be 
no comment.
See.
Right, we will make, move progress.
Thank you for that, er it's not, it's not easy ground and I do appreciate with which it's happening  and the lack of sarcasm that is occurring.
 
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
See this, this bit here  this, the whole  presentation  this this part of it here
Mhm.
which has got to be this 
Is that the next bit?
the national curriculum
which we
cor!
We're going onto to know.
I assume  that's where we're going onto now .
Yeah.
Okay?
Er 
We've then got two areas to look at  national curricular levels and general skills and abilities.
Can I assume that we sort of are happy with the format that there should be a national curriculum level and there should be a general skills and abilities?
I can make that assumption?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
We canno , we cannot disagree about this next little bit can we?
Right , the national curriculum levels  I am nearly o of the opinion to be almost glib and say  there will be a space that is about a third of a sheet of A four, it's down to every department to do their own  I nearly said, I don't care, I often do care 
 
but that's down to the professional expertise of dis departments.
Mm.
Is it or isn't it?
No, it's all 
No, no, no , they're all exactly the same!
 
I mean, there are four attainment targets, there are three attainment targets 
That's right.
Yeah.
they are these and tha 
You're obliged  
it's just the number of boxes that you're gonna change!
Is everybody happy with that layout for that?
Yes.
Yeah!
Ecstatic!
Mm mm mm.
Mm.
Nearly.
Go on Andrew.
God !
We nearly go agreements!
No, it's important!
What time does this 
Erm 
session end by the way?
Half three.
I dunno,i is there no tea there?
Half three.
It's called   
We'll we'll have a 
Cup of tea!
Hang on Angela!
Half past three today.
There's an awful lot of information that I've  put in there which I've photocopied and much reduced from the official documents
Mm.
which gives a great deal more information about the attainment targets than the  er, two or three words 
But ha they have got headings though haven't they?
Yeah they have.
I could have put the headings on as you have
Mhm.
and
to take the whole bloody lot out!
Ha!
Right
Oh!pages.
you you , absolutely, we'd go on forever and ever and ever  and er, therefore, I I, I withdraw all of that stuff  but, in a way I feel that it would be helpful for parents, probably who haven't seen this information  and might like maybe a sample
You mean you would like to present it in a different way?
some somewhere , yeah, maybe not on here
Mm.
not on each subject  but, maybe on the inside cover  of  er, a presented  re , er set of sheets  but wha wha , you know, however it's gonna be sent  or on the back of the summate sheet or something.
You know, for your information the attainment targets have  quite lengthy descriptions  here are one or two examples, here's a maths one, here's an English one, here's a 
Mm.
a  science one, for instance because, I don't suppose many of the parents  will have  seen o all the thickness of the document will 
No.
they?
they they've only had the taster because I sent home the erm  a map of  of D O S, D E S whatever I'm supposed to call it now.
D S E.
D S E. 
D S E. 
D S E.
I sent home the the that document in with the national curriculum's er report.
 
Which 
S 
I've now lost!
So in other words, some suggestion that  these headings
Are indicated more.
have a lot more , yes
Mm.
indicator  of of quite a rich scene  and, that the 
That's a nice image.
Yeah, thank you.
Anyway,
But you're in great danger there because you'll 
 
you will beco , it will come like this
Yeah.
and a parent will say, level four maths?
No, multiplication tables  find and average  and know how to work out an area, that's a doddle!
You know, I mean, there's an example of what they're saying.
I think
Level four, this is what you do in maths 
But that's only one bit of it isn't it?
you know , and that is a little piece of maths and tha , I mean, that is absolute rubbish!
It's only a very small part of level four.
Because they they've condensed it and just put in a few little bits and pieces!
Mm.
So you're against that because you think it trivialises it?
You cannot, you cannot give them the the national curriculum book!
I think there's an element, Paul comment?
I think we could all do what Andrew's  suggesting  quite easily  er  I could do it for Geography, erm, I just think it's making a lot of extra  work.
Garbage.
Yeah.
Mo more than it needs?
Yeah.
Can I just say then we seem to have agreed that that standard  Andrew points been taken on board and dismissed out of hand
No, I'm not cos I think it's quite a valid 
No I'm being 
point he's making 
I'm being mhm.
Erm
Don
It's whether we've  
I know you carry a lot of valuable stuff in your briefcase.
Can I borrow your briefcase?
Mm.
Thank you.
Ca , can I make a point about the tick now?
Mm.
Since we're at that point.
I put that  inversely i i he's put down inversely fro from what we will  we are obliged to do  we're obliged to say that these levels  ha er  have been  erm  have not been checked by  SATS
Mhm.
if they have been
Mm.
but I thought to th this way  it was 
Mhm.
you know,we we're obliged to put that little bit in  you know, there's year seven, year eight, year ten  the there won't be a tick in there and so the the these levels will be whatever you've decided they are  in the way that you  asses  but at the end of the key stage  this report will go out in Au i in September now  following SATS.
Mm.
Or it'll go out in July  God knows how we're gonna do it after SATS  in er a a ye at year fourteen.
So we've got to have that statement in  and we've got to differentiate it some way or from the
But if you had your name and year at the top you could actually put a simple statement along the bottom  because you'll only be issuing it for year nine
And eleven.
well, will you because year eleven is automatically  confirmed by  levels 
G C S E. 
at G C, G C S E?
But it is end of key stage four.
But we will have a record of achievement, this system will not be used for years
Mm.
year eleven, will it?
So we wouldn't need it, so all I'm saying is  you could put in one simple statement at the bottom, year nine de dun de dun de dun  and will  confirmed by SATS external test.
This will not be used at er  end of key stage four or something?
Well you use this reporting system in year ten  but year eleven
We'll have record of achievement.
you'll have a record of achievement and prob this this yo you'll have your own format, your amended format
but aren't we obliged  to to produce this  erm, in
September.
September 
Mm.
of of of the 
Yeah.
Following year, yeah.
end of that key stage four?
 
Yes, but it will be  it will be  this bit of it that  you know, the bit that comes 
Right.
from the from the boards  that we'll get, cos there'll be thousands and thousands of bloody numbers!
Oh!
That, that you're gonna send out to parents, they're gonna look at all these numbers and oh  
The end of key stage form 
 
can be different, different format.
Mm.
That
Mm.
the the bits of that tie into  
Let's wait to, wait till 
Yeah wait.
the thing arrives before we
Mhm.
So what I'm saying is this will  appropriate for year seven, eight, nine and ten
We're obliged to 
and a 
say  sorry!
Go on 
Right.
Don.
We're obliged 
What's that 
to say that if  er, it is not a SAT year, we are obliged to say these levels have not been confirmed by SATs  so the only in year nine  we, we don't need to say that.
But I think i it also  would highlight if you put it as a sentence
Right, fair enough.
that
rather we kept it in.
for year seven, eight parents it is coming, if you like, that at the end of year nine it's the end of the key stage and it's an important time de dun da, they're warned for two successive years.
I know it seems a little bit i idealistic, don't know what the word is I want  but it is for warning 
 
that what's happening that the end of  ninth year is an important time in terms of er er measuring  er their pupils er relative success.
So I'm suggesting that that, we could take that box out  er er and this be re-phrased as a sentence, either at the top 
So,
or underneath I don't mind which.
Okay?
How about this then, these levels have not been confirmed by SATS except  in the year nine report?
Well,
I I don't think you need the first 
No I don't.
part in.
No.
It's  negative.
well indi individual levels will be confirmed by external tests  
For year nine pupils these levels will 
 
be confirmed by 
When do they get the results for SATS?
SATS.
Don?
Mm?
When do they get the results for SATS?
July.
So 
You mark them yourself.
right, okay.
Send a report in don't you?
Cos we've gotta report on  year nine at the en , in  before
Mm.
September or  sorry, in July or 
Mm.
immediately we come back, which  is something else we have to sort out with our heads now.
The end of August I think it is in, which means then in July doesn't it?
Mm.
For year, so the sentence will be Don, for year nine pupils  er, these  levels  er  what did you put?
Have been confirmed by SA 
Will have been  future perfect.
And yo and you wouldn't be indicating that that's end of key stage three?
You didn't put it there!
Well  for, you know,the these levels will have been  confirmed  by  external tests.
What about year nine?
It goes year nine pupil 
I think you've gotta put SATS in, sorry.
The levels of year nine 
Alright, external test bracket SATS!
Right?
You're an awkward bugger you!
That's another technical term!
Yo you didn't put will have been confirmed in there but you want it in there now and then you put SATS bracket external test,extern , I can't even say it, and now you wanna put external test bracket SATS!
He's tired!
He's gorgeous!
There's another technical term.
Right, so we don't want that one, we want this one?
Have been confirmed by SATS.
They've been confirmed !
Been confirmed by SATS !
Okay.
Would you not be  indicating  end of key stage three somehow?
Or  do the does everybody
Alright, for year nine pupils  brackets, end of key stage three.
Yeah.
Okay?
It's important  these categories are set
set out for us.
Mm   
So 
Er
so we don't want this box any more then?
So 
What about this then?
This box 
Yes 
can disappear?
 
That box will go and you'll have name and year 
That's home.
spread out more across
No, I've put report down there.
I've put report down there, cos then you have science, report  math's, report  and I put Ralph Gardener Community High School cos then I need space for community.
I would put Ralph Gardener Community High School report on the heading, I would put name, year and your subject there or, subject whatever  I would tighten that up 
Right.
a bit.
Mm.
I think that that 
The lettering will be thinner 
needs to stand, it's awful!
Mm.
Ralph Gardener High School, Community High School 
It's a  
needs to be, in my opinion, on it's own above the rest.
Report 
Mm.
Andrew's  a a little bit better on layout than me and I'm
What  yo you want Ralph Gardener High Scho , Community High School by itself?
I bi I just thought it was 
Where do you want report then?
Well Ralph 
 
Gardener Community High School hyphen report.
Have I got space you see?
Will that not go on 
Community School.
the top?
Don't see why not.
I'm going back a step but I think it's 
What do you mean?
important.
You're gonna tr er, well no nothing else will fit in that page but  no eno not the package that you use 
Ralph Gardener Community High 
 
School report.
Well we won't necessarily be using your package  for doing this.
Mhm.
Fine!
Right, you use yours cos I'm not there!
who whose gonna do it then?
Well
I vote you!
 

I'm I'm  I was gonna come to, Andrew's made an offer but 
volunteered a long 
Right.
time ago.
that might, might er er erm   it's  we can be your system , what I'm saying is  
Is it yours?
.
Don't even know where it is!
Oh Terry you mean.
Oh no, just
That's alright 
sitting outside the kitchen.
Ah!
Those two  
A yes or a no?
It's It's tonight's supper!
Does  Ralph Gardener Community High School hyphen report is the heading at the top.
Mm.
Yes?
Mhm.
Okay.
Then below it you would have da da, year  and somehow the subject fitted in on a line across, below it?
So you'd have 
What for?
name, year and subject would go in there  in that box
that's been left free.
Do we agree that it should be big like that?
I think it, I I like the 
Yeah!
idea of it
Yeah.
the su the subject 
Yes.
stands out.
Yeah, that's right .
Er, do you want the subject  er, lettering the size as that?
This was Andrew's
No, I I I would like 
I'll sort that out.
Yeah.
I like it like this.
I I think probably we'll be in a situation where Andrew will do a knock up 
Well I think we need it smaller .
there will be several formats  that we can agree on at a later date.
Nice and big.
 
wallpaper Paul?
Yep.
Lovely jubbly!
Thank you very much, we've knocked that on the head.
General skills and abilities we're down to now.
Which is gonna be a  debatable one I would of thought.
Can we agree er the layout?
Ten point scale 
Yeah.
poor, satisfactory and 
 
excellent, scale and ability  what we need to agree on is the skills and abilities that we want in there.
Would you use excellent rather than good.
Well no ten, level ten is bloody good!
Excellent , yeah.
 
Okay  right, bloody good then, okay!
Right, bloody good !
And can we have crap instead of poor?
Yeah.
Crap, crap and bloody good, yes and er  middling!
Why do you always have poor?
Weak?
I want to convey that meaning but I would rather not use that word.
It is poor.
Yes, I know  but we're sensitive  
I've seen some words  we we 
Not me!
I would really call spade 
On on the ten point scale Alan 
a spade!
wha what's written?
Is there not something, not poor something written   ha, not W !
Working towards
!
You can't be working towards there!
No the  I tell you what Andrew's saying about poor
Weak  doesn't fit in.
No.
Doesn't fit in, how do you mean?
Doesn't fit in with satisfactory and excellent.
Mm, no.
No, it's gotta be poor.
Aye.
Now hang on
Pathetic!
Crap!
Shit !
!
The boy is shit !
Altogether, mm.
Un un unsatisfactory instead of poor
Oh !
Oh!
another word instead of satisfactory.
Safe.
Oh!
Aye, we're going back to 
The norm 
making fair progress now aren't we ?
Yes, that's right, yes.
He's making fair progress.
One in two, one in two !
 
!
There's  in somewhere.
I'd like to think of something.
Let's think of something.
Hey, come on let's cause , one, level one and two are national curriculum scales for somebody in our school is poor!
There's no value in it, don't start it off in that position as though there's an integral in it, all the 
Longman's Dictionary of  
all the same!
 
Life's a little bit more complex than that 
Is it Longmans?
 
Is that a Longman's one?
that's merely an over-view.
Yes it's Longmans!
Is that a Longmans dictionary?
It certainly is.
That I see before me?
Could I call for  
Massination , a plan for doing harm.
Can, can we leave that word alone for for a moment cos I think it's a bit of red herring  er, to some degree.
Pretty awful!
It will stand unless er  somebody can come forward with a very positive suggestion the mind's 
!
blank at the moment.
How about pretty awful and pretty  
Can 
!
Can can, can we look at the skills and abilities?
Yes sir.
Cos  you know this list is as good or as bad  you want to make it.
Erm  effort  we have that in probably
Yes.
everybody accept 
Mhm.
effort?
There yeah.
Mhm.
Angela?
Yep, that's fine, mm.
Yeah?
Er  we don't have concentration at the moment  erm, I'm not sure
Question mark.
Does that fit 
Yes I'm not sure about that.
what we mean by concentration  er, myself.
Mm.
Actually 
Ju 
I made them up just in the spur of the moment.
Well that's fine!
Mm.
That's no no sweat.
Sorry I haven't  
Behaviour?
it up.
Yep.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Yes .
Er
I wrote following instructions because I wanted  to somehow or other impart the ability to actually  er, do something other than just  er, to do something on their own, you know  to actually work on their own.
Ability to actually do something  rather than just copy something  to follow instructions means they've got to actually  do a ste step-wise thing.
Right?
Yeah we I must admit, would a, would a parent, I mean I was at a very simple level, following instructions, go and get that ruler Jimmy?
Aha.
In other words  you know i in a sense vidable 
Do doing as doing as 
Vidable.
they're told!
Yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Doing as they're told.
Mm.
Yeah.
I I know what you're saying and it's different to the way I'm interpreting it.
That's it, we need to follow a set of step lies, instructions becoming more difficult as you go on  that what was intended.
But you don't want to give the impression that our children are not .
That's the old one.
Mm.
Yes, active right, okay.
Involvement.
It must be there cos it's 
Involvement.
underneath that Longman's 
Alright.
dictionary look.
Right.
What about, what do you want Paul, sorry?
Sorry, can I  some of the old  can have some  
Oh they're there yeah.
Yeah, I'm .
What about a word like involvement?
The other thing Don is what are the gen , what are the the erm  skills and abilities, you see there is a mathematical theme, what are the, literacy, we're supposed
Yeah, we've got, yeah that 
to be addressing those.
yeah that's got to go in there I think.
Have you got to say mathematical skills?
No.
No.
No.
I can't remember what that one is.
I don't think 
Aye not subject
I think, I think 
a specific  
I think, yes, no I ju 
No  there 
No 
are general skills
Yes.
there are six or seven
Mm.
they're in the bottom of mind 
 
they've gone completely!
But would we not be calling 
Yes, and I can't remember 
it numeracy rather than mathematical 
Yes.
skills?
Alright.
Alright,no no if you say numeracy then they'll know what it means but  erm  I fe I felt that numeracy and mathematical skills would not be applicable to all, I mean, I don't think it might 
No.
be applicable to you, but  
 

Right, right sorry!
?
Okay!
Er, it might not be applicable to  talents or erm  hand spans or things like that but  I certainly would want to include it, it might be very important in, in my subject.
And I would like to be able to include it.
Er, I think we would, oh!
See, I think we're obliged to  to now say something about  erm  these general skills, I think  in light of what's been said in the last couple of weeks
Mm.
there should also be in there something like  grammar and spelling.
No, I totally disagree with that!
And certainly not in the light of what's been said in the last couple of weeks  that's 
Why?
extremely questionable!
What are the hell are they
What
What is that?
The 
I mean if we're gonna discuss that that needs to be, you need to go over that in more detail.
Is is is is there not an element that hinges round  orally  to do with the 
Yes.
ability to 
orally 
speak?
yes  er, and literacy that's something different.
Mm.
Oh come on now!
I mean the government is pushing  er  spelling a as as something which is very important  spelling is going to be part of all course work as well as all examinations now!
I'm not denying that.
Well  therefore, it's important to everybody!
I'm not denying that.
Therefore we better comment on it!
Well, no what I'm, what I'm denying is I'm questioning your assertion on what's been happening in the last couple of weeks  that we should react to that  on a pa on er er report that hasn't been released, right?
That's been partially responded to  some people suspect for political  reasons  and rushing to that on report and I think we need to  consider that in a more  way.
But don't you think that spelling is important for everybody to ?
Of course I do!
I think spelling's 
Well why not ?
important.
Angela I seem to rem 
The wrong one.
remember that just a few weeks ago that you were de , almost denying that we'd have to do this sort of thing!
What?
Do you, a few weeks ago?
Yeah, actually at the end of, end of 
I can't remember saying saying you 
last term yeah.
Oh!
When Don first actually  broached this whole thing.
No,a no 
With all due respect is tha is that re is that relevant?
No, hang on here  misrepresenting what I'm saying there.
No, all I'm saying is that  I'd like to support Don and what Don's just said there  and I think that er, we a that is what we are gonna have to do.
It might not be, be down as black and white 
But, no wait a minute cos they're two issues!
at the moment.
I , no, those are two i issues.
Mm.
First of all you're misrepresenting what I'm saying about those figures
Mm.
right?
And, whether you believe that or not  that is not effecting what I'm saying today and whether it's accurate or not!
That's right!
I I agree with you that those are concerns  but I would not like things like grammar to be isolated out from other language skills
No, not grammar but but basically, maths and English are the tools that the other subjects
Oh yes, I agree with you.
are are are working 
Could 
with.
Could we work under a more general, how would you feel about if we put something down like, I dunno, written work  would, is is that 
I've got written work.
Does that not  writing and neatness.
Writing and neatness , no  spelling is a , to my mind, spelling is important.
Of course it is, I'm not denying that!
Are 
I I to 
you repeating yourself?
No.
If we put, what about orally and literacy?
And that includes all.
We are obliged, I'll say it again
No, we're not 
we 
obliged!
We are obliged now  to write
G C S E?
to to to re to report on, er in all course work  to take five percent of our 
Yeah.
er
That's right.
course work  and base ma ma ma er do do something along the lines of spelling.
Sorry, I'm not putting it very well.
Yes, but that's assessed in English underneath the attainment target of writing.
No, it's a separate !
But we're obliged  every subject!
That  but anyway that doesn't ha hang on that  that doesn't approve what you're saying, what I'm saying as far as English is concerned  that's assessed underneath the attainment target writing
Mhm.
what I'm concerned about is put things down like that, er like that  it encourages erm  an appreciation of language skills that are bitty, partial, they can be pulled apart and it's not the model of language teaching that I would like to promote.
Right.
I'm not saying that spelling 
Mm.
isn't important, obviously as an English 
Mm.
teacher I'm not going to argue that but what I'm saying is that in this report I don't think that's necessarily the appropriate format.
Well how am I going to report  to parents  our spelling ?
Well  reporting them un underneath the writ li literacy  that is, that it's a literacy skill!
But I think it's a bit more specific than that isn't it?
Right.
If they don't, if they can't spell they're not literate!
And if they can't write in sentences they're not literate!
So you would just put in something for literacy?
So
Well what I'm sugge , but as an alternative I'm suggesting that as far as that's concerned you put down   
Well we 
No, I don't think most of parents would have a clue what you're talking about!
I'm sorry!
Don't you?
No.
But we've
Don't apologise!
But but you haven't argued with that mathematical innumeracy and I think it's a comparable situation!
Is it not?
Yes, well I I would object to 
I'm not su 
somebody talking about mathematical skills.
I think we're saying the same thing.
Mhm.
I'm trying to take an overview 
 
Yeah, yeah.
I think Angela's saying exactly the same 
I'm trying to take an over-view.
that Alan's saying and I think we'll have to respect that with all du 
Mhm.
with all due respect.
Ah, but at the same time we don't have to comment on mathematical skills  at G C S E.
No.
No, but the ar , the previous argument was whether there would be an un sa understanding of it, we won't understand literacy.
I think we have to recognise Angela's concern if er  a subject area that she's trying to present, present and she is not precluding you from doing what you've got 
Oh no !
to do, she's just offering a different way of doing it.
If you like, a different heading under which to do it.
Well 
So she would put wha in  you would put in what, sorry?
Just literacy.
I would put literacy.
Because it involves more things.
No no I disagree with that.
Yeah, I disagree, I think I would still like to put 
Yep.
spelling grammar  punctuation 
Yeah but 
whatever.
but these 
Is that not all part of literacy?
Yeah.
If, you see if you put down literacy the the whole show's in there, I mean if you're going to put i , put isolated spelling it i it encourages a very limited view of what English is about and success in using language.
It's nothing to do 
Angela?
with English!
At that  Oh!
Andrew, comment 
That's 
on that?
course it is, it's language is a 
I mean,a you sit outside it I 
medium of learning!
any axe to grind?
, it's not English subject area I'm talking about.
Erm  yeah, the the the axe  to to to grind is is  yes, I pick up the the the political stick here  er, that was  you know, that that, you know from the other the other end to you and yeah, yes I also think we're being beaten with a with a with a stick here  for three R's  er, if we're forced into the corner of having to use an ignorant white hall idiots er
Inadequately educated.
inadequately  educated persons   er, view of what it is to be well educated i.e.  we've got to comment on the spelling  as if it were important
But I think it is.
I think it is, yeah!
