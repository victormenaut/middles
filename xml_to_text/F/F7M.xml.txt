Er Nick  carry on  from the first six months after Oliver Twist  you can read
For the first six months after Oliver Twist  the system was full, was in full operat operation.
It was rather extensive at first and consequence of being  and a necessity of taking in clothes of all the paupers who, with, which  on a, on a waste of  after a week or two  the number of the workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were in, were in   and then in which the boys got back, were, were a large  was a cop was a copper at one end, after which the master dressed in an apron  and assisted by one or two women and they ladled the gruel at meal times.
Of this festive composition each boy had one
 corinder 
 corinder and no more except on occasions with great  the bowl never wanted washing, the boys polished, polished them with their spoons till they shone again and when they, when they had to form this operation, which never took very long,the bowl, they would sit staring at the copper with such eager eyes as if they could of devoured a  of which it was composed.
Employing themselves meanwhile and sucking their fingers most assid 
Assiduously
assiduously
Carefully
with a, with a the view of catching up any, any spare splashes of gruel that might be cast there thereon.
Boys with generally excellent appetite, Oliver Twist and his companions suffered from the tortures of slow starvation, starvation for three months, at least they got so for ferocious , is that right?
Ferocious, greedy and wild
and wild beyond er, that one boy who was  and hadn't been used to that sort of thing, for his father had kept a small cook stock  his companion that unless he has another basin of gruel  he was afraid he might, he might some night happen to eat, eat the boy he slept next to, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender eight  and they, and they impeccably believed him.
A counsel was held lots were  who should walk up to the master after supper that evening and ask for more, it fell Oliver Twist 
What is actually er  the boy is, could eat the boy next to him erm
what was it saying that was
Well erm, it's a bit, he was
he was just trying to scare him, trying to scare him
Were you right when the worst thing that this
he had big pies
it proves how desperate people get and then he treats them like animals and this boy said I think
Er  the evening arrived then  er David
The evening arrived, the boys took their places, the master in a cook's uniform stationed himself at the copper.
His four assistants  behind him.
The gruel was served up and a long grace was said over a short  the gruel disappeared, the boys looked at each other and went over, while his next neighbours nudged him, tired as he was he was desperately hungry and  he rest on the table and  the master with his  hands he said  
Yeah that's 
please sir, I want some more, the master of the  but he turned very pale  and then he  what, said the master at  in a stern voice, please sir, replied Oliver I want some more, the master  glare at Oliver's head with the ladle  
 
in his arms and treat  and Mr Bumble rushed into the room with great excitement and addressed the gentleman in the high chair said  I beg your pardon sir, Oliver Twist has asked for more, there was a  for more said  compose yourself Bumble and  do I understand that he asked for more after he'd eaten supper  he did sir replied Bumble, that boy would be hung  I know that boy will be hung 
this boy is a trouble maker and
and the boy would next morning would pass on the outside of the gate offering a reward of five pounds to anyone who would  in other words five pounds for Oliver Twist  I never in  for this in my life said the  in the white, white coat as he locked the gate and he went to  the next morning.
I never want to  
I had always 
anything in my life and then I am that boy 
by the white waistcoat the gentleman  
So what's he got against the
yeah, erm, he's also, what's his attitude to what he
yes, but is he, is he terribly serious about his job?
No, he's very sarcastic
Yeah, erm
you're right,
as I first show in sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should have
just yet, whether like Oliver Twist
Later Oliver Twist was very near getting a
in other words
Sorry
It could not of been easy
you'll find out actually why in a moment
A week after the  had asking for more, Oliver remained greater prisoner in the darken solitary room which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board, but it appears that at first sight not unreasonable disclose that  for a particular gentleman of white waistcoat.
It was established that  individual pathetic character once and forever by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook on, in the wall and attaching himself to the other to the performance, to, to the performance of this feat however  the pocket handkerchief inside  had been all  he, he only cried bitterly all day and when the longest  nights came on he spread his little hand before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the corner tried to sleep, everyone  drawing himself closer and closer to the wall  
It's most that any prisoner
you could do, but then again
yeah 
 

Let it not be spoke by  of the system that during the period of  as for exercise it was nice cold weather  a public warning had been  and so far this  uses the same apartment every evening at prayer time and there  selfish mind work a general publication for boys contain a special clause  by authority of the board in which they repeatedly made good, virtuous, protected, obedient as regarded to a  the powers of wickedness as an article direct from  
What is his crime?
He asked for more
He just asked for more  erm, one thing that is disturbing, what he does very causally mention is what is going on all the time
  

Well maybe not, but what is going on is
Fear
fear, all the time, if anybody to steps out of line or
as I was going with the fourth year to
what lies have been used?
how can they justify what they do?
yeah, they
they're being fed, they're still kind people taking care of them, they're very lucky people
and what do
and so we presumably, the little children
well I suppose you get
in a gutter or something, this place would be better, as long as you get fed, the stuff you get there is horrible, but at least it's food and er, these kind people are taking care of it.
In the outside world there's people waiting to exploit children and
er Anthony do you want
Erm  with  chimney sweeper was waiting down in the high street  he was waiting there  whoa said Mr  to the donkey, the donkey was  wondering probably whether he was  so without listening to a word of warning he jumped on him  
What makes you a bit disturbed about that?
He's trying to smash
Yes if he keeps the donkey like that
How's he treat children
how he treat children, yeah
The gentleman with the white waistcoat 
The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him after having delivered himself  having witnessed  with the donkey he smiled rejoicedly when that  the door, he saw at once it was Mr  Mr  smiled  as he pursued the  I am said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  
Erm  what is a
erm, you say the young boy was
Erm, where they, where they work as giving five pounds and Oliver Twist
or did they want five pounds for him?
Er I gather they
and er  the workhouse, the gentleman in the white waistcoat, why does he think that this
would feed the child regularly in a
That's it, yeah, he's
that beats the donkey, I mean all the donkey does is
he hits the donkey while he pulls the reins, hits the donkey again and he finds out later that
  

Well  the man in the white waistcoat  followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into  even if he gets stuck in a chimney, worse thing that he  the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared  his only chance he has is
Okay, now  erm now what's he supposed to be assessed by the board have they just said
er, why are
what's he doing?
Yeah, it's all religious, hypocrisy okay, humane, it's humane to slog these boys down the chimney, yeah, it's humane giving them a good beating isn't it, right then.
