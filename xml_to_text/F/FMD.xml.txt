Well now erm what it says here is that you want to sort of talk about possible options for a year out and then relevance of archaeology to career in surveying or land management.
That's 
Yeah.
basically what you want to talk about is it .
 
Okay well what about this year out then.
What what do you know sort of what you want to do at all or
Not not not a great deal I mean I'd like possibly to try and stay in erm the field of archaeology to some 
Mhm.
extent erm but obviously I also want to earn some money.
Cos erm  I w I'd like to erm do some sort of further qualification after  first degree so erm and now whether that is going on to do
Ah.
something with erm surveying or whatever erm through one of these courses which gives you exemption from their sort of passing their exams or whatever, or 
Yes I see.
whether it's to do archaeology heritage graduate which I'm also interested 
Right.
in.
that 
Right.
means I've got earn three and a half thousand pounds f five thousand pounds erm at some point to pay 
Er  
for that and living expenses.
And you hope to do this in one year out do you?
You hope to get somewhere towards there anyway .
So well I don't  hope to get somewhere anyway yes.
Yes I see erm er well I suppose the question is erm  well I mean if the aim is to earn money basically in this year out then d do you have any skills which are in high  demand and people will pay for ?
Well I'm I'm really not sure I mean erm 
Erm er or even  any skills which would make you employable at all 
Yeah.
is is another you know 
 
erm
It's erm I've got I mean I've got a job for the first six weeks already set up with 
Have you yeah.
the department but working as a supervisor 
Yeah yeah.
on one of their sites.
Oh great.
So you know that's about 
That's okay.
seven hundred pounds straight off that I've got .
Right yeah.
So erm I've got a bit of time also in which to apply for a few things and go and see a few people erm 
Yes yes.
so
Yeah.
the other option of course is not to do that and to try and gain some experience erm m maybe voluntary for some of the time so that maybe I can then spend you know in another years time get a job which is a bit more relevant and I'll be able to earn some money.
I see yes to transfer so the other aim would be to try and get some skills which er would improve your chances of doing whatever 
Yes.
it was you wanted to do in 
Yeah.
in the end yes.
Erm well if if we I mean you're you're probably fairly clear about the archaeology area 
Yeah.
and you probably know more about that than I do so I won't you know 
Yeah.
there are other people who could 
Yeah.
tell you more about that.
So erm may maybe we should look at the surveying, land management bit 
Yeah.
which I must admit I'm not an expert on.
But erm my understanding of erm gaining a surveying qualification
Mhm.
is that basically erm you you go and work as a dogsbody and erm graduates are allowed to take the exams within two years and and you'd probably have to go on night school thing or something 
 
to get it you know.
But basically there aren't any real really or there are very few decent schemes where they actually take graduates 
Yeah.
with a view to training them properly.
Yeah.
And more or less you just earn your bread and butter er doing things I mean it might be in the office
Yeah.
doing clerical work or it might be using erm surveying instruments now 
Yeah.
I mean are you
Yes yes 
can you do all that?
I mean that's that's one of the things I want ed to talk about was the relevance of archaeology to that sort of work I mean certainly I've done surveying you know
Right.
fairly elementary surveying but more or less I know how to use 
Well  
a level and er 
Yeah.
a theodolite and that sort 
Right yeah.
of thing so I would have thought that it's the sort they're looking for .
Yes well I'm sure there are that you know there there might be some scope for doing that 
Yeah.
erm er it might be sort of rather like archaeology you know er 
Mm.
when they've got to do the road or something they want somebody to do it for the three weeks or 
Yeah.
three days or whatever it takes 
Yeah.
to do it and then they don't really want them any more.
Yeah.
So but but on the other hand if you've got  somebody I suppose a firm that was doing that sort of work and they 
Yeah.
knew you could do it I I'm just not erm at all sure of er how that actually works.
I mean erm presumably I mean obviously the local authority has its own people
Yeah.
who do that.
Well a a as far as I'm aware anyway from all from reading 
Yeah.
the information there appears that there should be private companies I actually haven't looked in the Yellow Pages yet actually  I should do that and you know and yeah 
No no who do it who do that sort of work yeah.
you know maybe I am the sort of person they're looking for who's already done a little bit of surveying erm to to join as a dogsbody and then over the two years or four years however long it does take erm you know slowly presumably you just get given more responsibilities.
The the 
Erm 
the best training for surveying now interestingly we recently had a a thing about this from gosh.
I can't remember where it was now but it it was certainly you know probably one of the er new er very new universities you know the ex-polys 
Yes yeah.
and they were running a surveying course in conjunction with the er Inland Revenue which now 
Yeah yeah.
Yes I  
Oh have you?
Well that's 
Nearly.
er nearly well that's the best thing I've seen for getting sort of properly qualified erm 
Yeah there there are a number of courses which you do
Mm.
Erm  most of which are only a year which 
Right.
give you exemption from 
Partial do they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some some of them actually give you exemption from all of them although I think they're 
Right.
maybe no only they're more than a year.
Yeah.
Erm I have heard that there's a particularly there's a good correspondence course with Reading University.
Well Reading does the degrees in estate management 
Yeah.
so  I mean they'd 
Yeah so  
know what they were about if 
Yeah.
they were running a correspondence 
Erm yeah 
course.
The think is I have to earn money to do those beforehand.
You know  
Yes well I suppose it's a question of how much a correspondence course actually costs.
Yeah.
And it should be relatively cheap.
Because I 
Well that's what I thought 
mean you know they don't
Yeah.
er I mean it depends I suppose the extent to which there's any tutorial element but I mean erm whether they have you there for a week or something and teach you some of the practical 
Yeah.
stuff.
But but it's obviously very minimal compared 
Yeah.
with with what you get  
Yes I mean I'm wondering if perhaps
Mm.
I mean I may be able to get some money from my parents a little bit
Mm.
erm and with this money that I'm going to earn in the first six weeks and then possibly erm getting a job while I'm doing the correspondence course erm you know even if it's just bar work and  especially 
Yeah yeah.
if I'm living at home which  
It would be cheap yeah yeah.
erm then maybe I would be able to do to 
Mm.
do the correspondence course.
I think the thing about correspondence courses is that erm y you have to be very good at disciplining yourself 
Yeah.
you know because there's no sort of backup really I mean alright 
No.
you've got your assignment and it has to be done by the end of the week or the end of the fortnight or 
Yeah.
whatever it is and you've really got to get it off and then presumably it's marked and 
Yeah.
maybe there are some things you haven't covered or 
Yeah.
whatever and maybe  if it's a good correspondence course they may refer you to the actual you know things you should have er read and so on 
Yeah.
erm and then you've got to do that 
Yeah.
and get on with the next one
Yeah.
and and it's really almost all up to you.
I think erm  I I think I could do that.
Right yeah yeah .
I think if especially if I wasn't if it was one of if it was my main
Yeah so I mean if you were doing bar work but really that wasn't the main job yes yeah yeah yeah .
erm yeah if that was the case then I would be able to do that.
Well well the thing about it I suppose is that erm er then you've got to take the exam haven't you?
Yeah.
Erm but I think I think certainly I would have thought a place like Reading probably half their people set the exams anyway so 
Yeah.
you know they it should be pretty well
Yes.
spot on for 
Yeah.
what you what you actually 
Yeah.
want you know the the key thing is to discover what how much work a week you know how many hours a week they think it's going to take now that's 
Yeah  
actually extremely difficult to estimate really 
Yeah.
because I mean you know some people are pretty quick
Yes.
and some people are actually rather slow.
Yeah.
And erm but I mean I remember when I I was doing er work with the Open University now I was a sort of er tutor with them or counsellor with them and I think we used to say ten to fifteen hours work a week
Yeah.
erm for one of their subjects you know one of their main
Yeah.
er full courses and I think too people tend to say about that level for something like the accountancy
Right.
erm qualification.
So that's probably what you're looking at.
Yeah that's 
Erm 
that's actually not  really .
It isn't that much is it really not if you're doing bar well well 
Yeah.
it can work quite well with bar work cos bar work's a real pain cos it 
Yeah.
splits the day up in such 
Yeah.
an awkward way doesn't it.
Yeah.
But if you get in a couple of hours
Yeah.
and you work really hard at it and then you go back and do your 
Yeah.
you know it's 
I mean  fifteen hours in in a week is not much at all when you consider how much you're expected to do for a degree  
Right  well it may be of course you see on the other hand the accountancy takes three years.
Now er it it could be it yes but I think you need to check that to to see 
Ah yes it could be that you're expected to do thirty hours a week.
yeah yes right yeah 
what they and they if it's a good course they should actually have some sort of estimate of this 
Yeah.
you know.
Erm and I mean you've obviously got to judge a bit your own capacity 
Yeah.
to say well if it's a lot of it's erm maybe there's quite a lot of figure work or something 
Yeah.
then if you're not actually frightfully hot at that 
Yes.
then maybe that's going to take you a bit longer.
So 
Yeah.
you know you maybe err on the safe side a bit but as you say even if it's erm well thirty hours would be getting
Yeah.
er quite probably doable but 
Yeah.
you don't want much more than that do you?
Don't want much more than that no.
Oh as you you know.
Anyway I think that's worth checking.
I think the er the course actually leads to 
Mm.
complete exemption from the the exams .
Does it yes all the exams.
Yeah.
Then you've got to get the experience
Yeah.
presumably to qualify.
Yeah I think I think once you've 
Erm yeah.
done that you're then you then are in a position to join a firm
Mhm mhm .
properly still probably as a bit of a dogsbody and then you have a sort of 
Mhm.
probationary period where
Erm I mean it depends 
 
what you're looking for I mean there were firms like  you know 
Mm.
this huge firm in London erm who used to take graduate trainees on
Yeah.
but they were much more interested in people of course with degrees  but they did take people who hadn't.
Yeah.
Now if you'd passed the exams
Yeah.
They'd er you might it might be worth writing around to see what the or or even ask the people who are running the correspondence course you know what 
Yeah.
the chances are or or whether the pattern is that you get a dogsbody job in an ordinary firm of estate agents you know and you're 
Yeah.
doing that and that's working your time out so that 
Yeah.
then you know I'm not sure either whether of course I mean one would hope that erm the institute would have certain requirements about the erm practical period that you 
Yeah.
actually had to have experience of 
Mm.
X Y and Z you know.
I think there's very strict erm you know  
Erm yeah so so so you might be able to find out from the institute
Yes.
who was offering this .
Yes yes.
Erm and the approach them and try and find out
Yeah.
what the chances were.
Cos I I think you probably need to check it out a bit 
Yeah.
before embarking on you know that.
I mean I mean obviously the it may be that erm there's very little these days I'm afraid which is an absolutely copper bottomed guarantee you know but if if if they were able to say well you know yes we do take people who've got the exams you know we took somebody last year or whatever.
Mm.
And and you could get a feel for the fact that they did do it.
Yeah.
Erm then you know that would be something whereas if they say well the recession's so bad we haven't taken anybody for the last five years and your researches can't unearth anybody who seems to be prepared to er give you even half a chance then I mean 
Yeah.
it's obviously not
Yeah  
probably a very good idea .
Yeah.
I mean I think 
Erm.
Reading and Sheffield and whoever are doing the course 
Yeah.
they should have things about who they've placed where?
Well they should 
Erm.
the thing is you have to be slightly careful about those because 
Right.
erm it may depend on what experience the people had before they did the course.
Yeah and you can't tell  
And and if if if you know they had none at all 
Yes.
and th you know they came from an arts background fine you know 
Yeah.
then they really like you.
Yeah.
Erm but you know if if they've got a couple of years in er something and 
Yeah I mean it is  the Sheffield one
Mm.
it says in the brochure that they're looking 
Ah.
for people who are er who have already maybe ex a bit of experience.
So they've 
Ah yeah yeah.
actually said that so yes  
Yeah so so you've got to be slightly careful but I mean if you already can use theodolites and things then in a sense I mean what do they mean by experience?
Yeah.
Erm and er so you know but you've just got to be slightly careful I think of the figures and erm  i if if you know it's much better if you can talk to the the 
Mm.
admissions tutor or whatever or 
Mm.
or concoct a letter which asks some very direct questions
Yeah.
you know erm er which cover the business of previous experience and  or somebody how many people do they have with your particular background of a little
Yeah.
er actual practical surveying experience in the context of archaeological digs er and so on you know and can they say what those people have gone on to 
Yeah.
Erm
I mean what what ideally I'd like to do is to go is to get those qualifications and then move into back into the field of of archaeology working with 
Oh I see.
someone like English Heritage, Nation Trust people like that who are lo who are you know who work with erm 
Mm.
valuers and er you know surveyors that and you know.
Mm.
you know working out the potential of their land and how they can erm use their land and their properties to the best 
Mm.
effect so erm  whether that means actually working directly for them or working for a company who specializes in erm  the management of historic erm buildings or environments or areas .
Yes I th I think you've 
Yes.
yes it's tricky isn't it I'm afraid we don't know who these companies are.
Yeah.
Now that's what you really need to find out isn't it 
Yeah.
and then to find out what sort of people they've got working for them and what qualifications.
Yeah.
I mean architects use these sort of people don't they 
Yes yes yes.
because I remember erm talking to to to one and there are a number in York who 
Yes.
do this sort of work.
Well I would imagine so and I th I think if I talk to Jane 
Yes she might have some ideas .
she would be the person who would know about 
Mm.
it or Martin maybe.
Erm you know 
Mm.
Yes yes.
and possibly even go down to the trust and talk to them.
Oh that's a good idea cos I gather the department 
 
and the trust don't quite
No.
So they might know some different people .
Be better for doing yes exactly.
yes  Yeah yeah mm yeah yeah.
I think perhaps there are a few more places where I can get some information but 
I think the architects cos I was I was engaged in trying to find a sort of temporary work for er somebody in archaeology and and erm I remember I got to s to an architect and and he did quite a lot of that sort of work you know and they 
Yeah.
would know who do which architects do that sort of work.
And I think he was keen on whether the person could do erm sort of surveying of a of a building and actually you know do the drawings
Yeah.
for it.
So that 
Yeah.
I mean if you could do that
Yeah well certainly the you 
then 
know that we've that's part of our training.
Well they they're very interested in that because 
Yeah.
you know they will have to do that sort of thing as part of a a job and they don't really want to spend time doing it.
Erm well it's cheaper if they can employ 
Yeah.
somebody
Yeah.
I mean I know also one architects firm in Gloucester where I live.
Oh yes.
So that deals with that because when I was originally going to do my er dissertation I was going to look 
Oh yes.
at farm buildings and Jane  said get in touch with 
Oh I see.
this this arch this this architect because this bloke is particularly interested in it and he deals with historic buildings and things like that.
So erm 
Mhm.
you know I can always go back there as well.
Well maybe you could have a go back there too .
Yes I mean it's obviously better to work in both places 
Mm.
Yes cos you need all the contacts you can 
exactly yes .
Yeah mm mm yes.
So I think maybe sort of first priority is find out a bit more information then about erm who employs these sorts people.
I think that's right I'm sure the architects do those and and there are sort of architects' practices who are particularly interested in
Yeah.
doing sort of historic buildings and so on.
Erm and and that of course is the sort of area that you want to get into really isn't it .
Exactly yes yeah.
Erm so they that might be quite a good area .
Yeah I hadn't actually thought of architects so that's 
Mm.
And of course there is the institute of advanced architectural studies in the University 
Yes yes 
I mean I don't know whether they and they run this conservation course you 
Yeah.
see so I mean they should know
They should know who these yeah yeah .
who these architects are .
Er if you can get in to their see their secretary or somebody er I expect 
I see.
she might be able to
Yeah.
you know or or if any of your erm archaeology know anybody in there or something.
I'm sure Jane will
Yes.
know.
Well she may know who are the architects are anyway.
She I'm sure she will working with
Mm.
R C H  
Mm.
I think I think that's a a useful sort of line.
Yeah.
Erm
And also to find out more a bit more about the correspondence course  
Yes exactly you know what it is and
I mean clearly I I don't think at the moment I'm in a position to to apply for a a taught course because I don't have the money.
Right.
So that's out unless erm you know  
Oh oh that's I was going to say do you do you know about career development loans?
No.
Well I mean either borrowing the money I'm afraid 
Yeah yes.
but I mean you know they're what what well there there is a sort file out there on them somewhere.
Erm and basically what it is is it's a government sponsored this er which erm well the rules may have changed cos they're always changing the rules of these things.
Erm er I think they're probably and and they're putting more effort into getting the unemployed off being unemployed off being unemployed into course aren't they so probably the they may have improved things but anyway the basic erm idea of it was that you borrow money er you borrow erm money to finance a course which is going to get you a job.
Yeah.
Now you could claim that this work is it's obviously vocational isn't it.
Yeah.
Erm er and if you had done some researches into the job opportunities and you you could decide that then that that would be good.
Erm and the limit was five thousand pounds for one year but I think they only pay half the fees or something of whatever course it is.
And it only courses one year's duration maximum one year .
Right yeah well most of these are one year anyway so 
Well that's fine then erm and what what what happens is that you do it through a bank but there are banks which I think Barclays and the Cooperative Bank and maybe one or two others do it.
And erm the the the erm scheme is that the government pays the interest while you're on the course
Right yes.
and then you have to start paying it back and paying the interest you know.
Yeah.
So the idea is that you obviously need to get a job pretty quick 
Yeah  
Erm I mean obviously yo 
Yeah I mean I'd I'd like to avoid  really 
Going into debt like that if you could but but you might use it to top up
Yeah.
you see if you can get a certain amount of money yes I mean take out two thousand or something 
take out a small one  thousand pounds short Yeah.
Erm it might make a lot of difference to your sort of er 
Yes  yeah.
ability to survive the year in without serious discomfort you know to have another 
Yeah.
thousand quid or something.
Erm and then of course there would be a I don't know what the rates of interest are or the payback period but the erm of course the longer the payback period the more it costs you in the end so .
Yes  
But erm I I imagine their rate of interest would be kept fairly low.
Yeah well I anyway I shall
Mm.
definitely look into that cos it could you know it it'd be a bit annoying if I was five hundred pounds a thousand pounds short at the end of the day  
Yeah sure sure you could just do it.
And of course I suppose the advantage of that is too that erm if you needed the money to pay the course fees to get on the 
Mm.
course well if you get it from them you just get the money and then 
Yeah.
you could er er 
Yeah.
actually sort of shell it out erm .
Yeah.
Just I mean out of interest the reason why I didn't take Sheffield  
Oh yes.
one was because they er wanted you for four years for definite after that working in evaluation so basically you're committing yourself for five years 
Oh did they oh I see yeah.
including the course time of course.
Yeah.
You felt that was a bit long.
So that's why I didn't take it.
Well it wasn't working in the field that I want to work in.
No no no .
And I thought you know and I think basically it'd be er sort of assessing the value of buildings for council tax and things like that which is  yeah 
Oh it is yes entirely so I'm sure that's what it is basically.
Because it's actually part of the Inland Revenue so I mean  that's what they're about  
Yes  so  they they say you know there's all sorts of things you do farms and you get into the country and you do land as well but I reckon ninety eight percent of of their people are doing houses  so
Well I suppose you see maybe what they're trying to do I mean as far as I know I mean previously the Inland Revenue or  the valuation office part of the Inland Revenue they actually used to run a scheme where 
Right.
worked for them and you qualified while you were working for them.
Yeah.
And as far as I know that that was the erm most erm sort of financially effective
Mm.
way of actually getting qualified because 
Yeah.
they really did have a proper scheme and you were paid a sort of reasonable wage
Yeah.
and you were sort of given the time and and and er er you know I'm sure they paid for the books or whatever you needed 
Yeah.
and and they paid the fees and so on whereas er anywhere else you just work for a firm of estate agents and they pay whether they pay you and the qualifications up to you you go off and do it and you know 
You don't really  I mean I think I don't know maybe working for a char firm of chartered surveyors you have I mean it's the same system isn't working as a dogsbody and then maybe
Yeah.
finally working up and 
Yeah and and 
You have to do it over four years I think if you do it that way  
Oh do you?
If I think you I mean you can go into it if you've erm I mean the minimum qualification they say is only G C S Es
Yeah yeah.
Obviously it takes a lot longer to do.
Right.
Erm so perhaps with a degree it would only take maybe three years
Well I think I think er from memory they the the there is a dispensation in the professional erm
Yeah.
you know qualifications which says that graduates can take it in two years.
Right.
Can sit the exams in two years 
If you're working with a chartered surveyors company 
I think that's probably true 
Yeah.
I don I don you know erm and so there is a it is reduced.
Yeah.
And maybe the correspondence slots into that .
Yeah yeah.
Erm
And saying maybe you know I should look up  see if I can find some.
Well that's another you know route really al although I think your architects
Yes I think that's 
If you could work with 
Yes.
an architect who was using you er to to to survey and draw 
That would be ideal.
historical buildings and you just worked with him and you took the exams on the side as it were.
Yeah.
Erm
Yeah.
and he probably wouldn't mind that you were only going to be there for a year or two you know he's getting 
Yeah.
a good deal out of it so.
So I mean there might even be you know might even you might even  
Might stay on.
his he might be able to get other people from where I've you know from the department here who are also interested in that.
I'm sure there 
Mm.
will be people who would
Yeah.
you know jump at the opportunity to get
Mhm.
to do that so
Yeah yeah well yes.
Right.
Right.
Mm.
I Shall erm
Well does that is that about 
Yes 
about it fine okay 
I mean that's yeah 
that's given you a bit more
Yeah.
food for
Yes.
thought and so on.
Yes and and a sort of a bit of a way forward.
Well you sound pretty organized  compared to some of them.
Erm and you do have a definite sort of track to look at.
Yeah I mean a few months ago I had absolutely no idea at all what 
Yeah.
I was going to do so
Yeah yeah.
erm I was slowly sort of pulling a few ideas out of thin air.
And 
Yeah yeah well it sounds sounds as though it's possible you know you may have to I mean in the end you might have to sort of compromise it and actually do this valuation thing.
Yeah.
You know if that was only way to get qualified .
Yeah.
I mean I think I've already resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to have to do one maybe two years more before I get anything like
Right.
into the field that I want to be in you know I don't think it's possible to just walk straight in unless you're very lucky .
It's no no 
It's erm
Yeah the other thing you might keep an eye on is erm try to develop computing skills.
Yeah.
You know as you go along I mean
Yeah.
if there's any or or doing that in addition to something you know erm 
Yes I mean we do do
You do some.
some and I have done a little bit on AutoCad which is erm making maps and things
Oh right.
and you do bui plans of buildings on it and that sort of thing as well.
Erm so I may sort of look into it a bit more maybe get a bit more experience 
Yes.
and it's erm
I suppose of course in fact the that sort of computing is is is fairly erm specialized isn't it 
Mm.
really in a way.
But I think even if you're familiar with computers generally and have good keyboard skills that's  
and also knowing what's available and you know how things work 
Well that's yeah 
like  or something 
Yeah.
where you take a picture of a building and you 
Right.
can see which 
Right.
er parts are old and  things like that and
Yeah.
all sorts of things which are available which if I just brushed up on so at least if I went to an interview I'd be able to talk about  
And you could talk about it yes I I think that's it.
You've got to be able to put on a bit of an act 
Yeah yeah.
at the interview.
If they subsequently discover that actually your knowledge is pretty sketchy but at least you've got some well 
Yeah.
you probably at least know enough to go off and get started
Yeah yeah.
and then sort it out you know.
Mm great .
 
Okay well good luck with it anyway .
 
Oh oh right I'd better turn this thing off now erm
