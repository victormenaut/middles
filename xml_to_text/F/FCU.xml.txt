May 12
Russell L.J., French and Ebsworth JJ.
Crime — Evidence — Documents, admissibility of — Statements by defendant in bankruptcy proceedings — Subsequent prosecution for theft offences — Whether documents admissible — Theft Act 1968 (c. 60), s. 31 — Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45), s. 433
The defendant, a bankrupt, was charged with obtaining property by deception, contrary to section 15(1) of the Theft Act 1968 by providing false information to a building society in order to obtain a mortgage.
The prosecution sought to adduce in evidence documents which contained statements made by the defendant in the earlier bankruptcy proceedings.
The judge ruled that section 31 of the Theft Act 1968 under which admissions made in ‘proceedings for the recovery or administration of any property’ were inadmissible in evidence in proceedings for an offence under that Act, did not apply to bankruptcy proceedings and that the documents were admissible in evidence under section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 The defendant was convicted.
On appeal against conviction:—
Held , dismissing the appeal, that section 31 of the Theft Act 1968 was limited in its application to civil proceedings and did not extend to bankruptcy proceedings, which were the subject of a statutory scheme set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency Rules 1986; that in bankruptcy proceedings the privilege against self-incrimination was abrogated by the Rules, and section 433 of the Act of 1986 rendered statements made in such proceedings admissible in evidence ‘in any proceedings;’ and that, accordingly, the judge's ruling that the documents were admissible was correct (post, pp. 499C–E, H — 500B).

Appeal against conviction.
On 18 February 1992 at the Crown Court at Snaresbrook, before Judge Rucker and a jury, the appellant, Yash Pal Kansal, was convicted of obtaining property by deception, contrary to section 15(1) of the Theft Act 1968, of being a bankrupt and removing property, contrary to section 354(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986, and of being a bankrupt and failing to account for property, contrary to section 354(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986.
He was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.
He appealed against the conviction on the ground, inter alia, that documents containing statements made by him in bankruptcy proceedings should not have been admitted, by virtue of section 31 of the Theft Act 1968.
The facts are stated in the judgment.

Russell L.J.
read the following judgment of the court.
This appeal raises a point of law that hitherto has not been ruled upon in this court.
There was a second ground of appeal concerned with a point of mixed law and fact but this was abandoned by counsel and we need say no more about it.
On 10 February 1992, at the Snaresbrook Crown Court, the appellant pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing four counts which ultimately were left to the jury.
Count 1 alleged the obtaining of property by deception contrary to section 15(1) of the Theft Act 1968, the particulars being that on or about 16 March 1988 the appellant dishonestly obtained from the Halifax Building Society a cheque for £150,000 by falsely representing (a) that his basic annual income was £90,000,(b) that he had never been bankrupt and did not have any judgment or proceedings for debt outstanding and (c) that he did not have any bank or other loans or charge/credit card debts.
Count 2 was in identical terms in that it alleged the same offence but it involved a cheque for £116,250 obtained on or about 23 March 1988.
Count 4 charged the offence of a bankrupt removing property contrary to section 354(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986, and alleged that on or about 23 March 1988 the appellant removed property, namely his interest in funds held jointly by himself and his wife amounting to £104,356.55, possession of which he would have been required to deliver up to the official receiver or the trustee in bankruptcy.
Count 5 alleged another bankruptcy offence with which this appeal is not concerned.
After a trial lasting seven days and presided over by Judge Rucker, the jury convicted the appellant of the four counts.
The appellant's wife was acquitted of aiding and abetting the appellant on count 4 and discharged.
It is necessary in his judgment to relate the facts only in the barest outline.
The appellant came to this country from India in 1967 and in 1973 he qualified as a pharmacist.
In about May 1977 he formed a company called Yash Pal Kansal & Co., which flourished until by 1983 it operated some 20 chemist shops.
At about this time the appellant purchased a house, 7, Ernest Road, Hornchurch, in joint names with his wife and with the assistance of a mortgage in the sum of £60,000.
Later in 1986, again in joint names, the house was remortgaged.
The original mortgage was paid off and the balance invested in the business.
By this time, however, the appellant was encountering financial problems, and the company likewise, to the extent that in February 1986 a finance company obtained judgment against the appellant in respect of a loan of £4,000 and the company went into liquidation in February 1987.
On 20 May 1987 the finance company presented a bankruptcy petition against the appellant and a bankruptcy order was made on 11 March 1988.
Five days later, on 16 March 1988, the Halifax Building Society advanced £150,000 upon the security of 7, Ernest Road, Hornchurch, and a further £116,250 a week later on 23 March 1988.
These advances formed the subject matter of counts 1 and 2, the Crown alleging that the building society had been misled by the appellant, through his agent or representative, in the respects alleged in the two counts.
All we need to say about count 4 is that on 23 March 1988 the appellant's wife collected £104,356.55 in cash, part of the building society advance, from the bank, and took it in a bin liner to India.
The Crown alleged that this was done at the instigation of the appellant with knowledge that the money should have been delivered up to the official receiver or the trustee in bankruptcy.
On 20 May 1988 the appellant made a statement of affairs pursuant to the Insolvency Rules 1986 (S.I.
1986 No. 1925), and a narrative statement to an examiner of the official receiver's office.
On 29 July 1988, at the Romford County Court, the public examination of the appellant took place.
We have a transcript of the examination.
For the purposes of this judgment it is sufficient to record that the official receiver asked the appellant a number of questions bearing upon the events giving rise to counts 1, 2 and 4, most particularly counts 1 and 2, and elicited from the appellant, albeit reluctantly, answers which were incriminating.
At the trial of the appellant the Crown intended to lead evidence from the official shorthand writer at the Romford County Court, producing a transcript of the appellant's public examination, and from an officer of the court, the appellant's bankruptcy file.
In the absence of the jury, counsel for the appellant submitted that the documents were inadmissible in the criminal proceedings.
The judge ruled that the documents were admissible, and this appeal is basically against that ruling.
We have heard extensive submissions in this court from Miss Mary Arden (who did not appear in the court below) on behalf of the appellant.
We are grateful to her and to Mr. Michael Crystal (who likewise did not appear in the court below) on behalf of the Crown, for their assistance.
It is common ground that the appeal turns upon the proper construction of section 31 of the Theft Act 1968, and the impact of section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Section 31 of the Act of 1968 provides:
‘(1) A person shall not be excused, by reason that to do so may incriminate that person or the wife or husband of that person of an offence under this Act —(a ) from answering any question put to that person in proceedings for the recovery or administration of any property, for the execution of any trust or for an account of any property or dealings with property; or (b ) from complying with any order made in any such proceedings; but no statement or admission made by a person in answering a question put or complying with an order made as aforesaid shall, in proceedings for an offence under this Act, be admissible in evidence against that person or (unless they married after the making of the statement or admission) against the wife or husband of that person.
(2) Notwithstanding any enactment to the contrary, where property has been stolen or obtained by fraud or other wrongful means, the title to that or any other property shall not be affected by reason only of the conviction of the offender.
It is contended by Miss Arden that bankruptcy proceedings are ‘proceedings for the recovery or administration of any property’ or ‘for the execution of [a]trust.’
Accordingly, whilst a person such as the appellant is not excused from answering any question in those bankruptcy proceedings because of self incrimination, he is protected in ‘proceedings for an offence under this Act’(i.e. the Theft Act 1968), his answers not being admissible in evidence against him in those proceedings.
In support of this fundamental submission Miss Arden developed a number of propositions.
(1) Bankruptcy proceedings are ‘proceedings.’
She cited In re Wallace (1885) 14 Q.B.D. 22. (2) The bankruptcy process is very much concerned with getting in and distributing the assets of the bankrupt.
This is an important part of the duties of the official receiver or the trustee in bankruptcy, and the words ‘for the recovery or administration of any property’ are apt to cover their duties.
They also execute a statutory trust in the course of their duties within the meaning of ‘the execution of any trust’ to be found in section 31. (3) Upon a fair reading of the whole of Part IX of the Insolvency Act 1986 (sections 264 to 371), to many sections of which Miss Arden directed our attention, there is nothing in the wording of section 31 that excludes bankruptcy proceedings from the ambit of the section.
(4) The privilege from self incrimination has been enshrined in our system of law for centuries.
If it is abrogated there should be a counter balance such as is to be found in section 31 rendering inadmissible in criminal proceedings self incriminating statements.
(5) It is not part of the bankruptcy process, nor should it be a part of the bankruptcy scheme, to ensure that bankrupts are prosecuted and the court should shrink from a construction of the statute that lends support to any such result.
We must now look at section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986:
‘In any proceedings (whether or not under this Act)—(a ) a statement of affairs prepared for the purposes of any provision of this Act which is derived from the Insolvency Act 1985, and (b ) any other statement made in pursuance of a requirement imposed by or under any such provision or by or under rules made under this Act, may be used in evidence against any person making or concurring in making the statement.
Miss Arden submits that this provision must be read subject to section 31 of the Theft Act 1968, and that if there is conflict between the two sections, section 31 should prevail.
It is a specific provision giving protection in a limited field, as opposed to the generality of the terms of section 433 of the Act of 1986.
Reliance was placed upon the words of the Earl of Selbourne L.C. in Seward v. Vera Cruz (Owners)(1884) 10 App.Cas. 59, 68:
‘Now if anything be certain it is this, that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specifically dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special legislation indirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any indication of a particular intention to do so.
Miss Arden also cited Blackpool Corporation v. Starr Estate Co.
Ltd. [1922]1 A.C. 27, 34, where Viscount Haldane said:
‘a rule of construction…is firmly established.
It is that wherever Parliament in an earlier statute has directed its attention to an individual case and has made provision for it unambiguously, there arises a presumption that if in a subsequent statute the legislature lays down a general principle, that general principle is not to be taken as meant to rip up what the legislature had before provided for individually, unless an intention to do so is specially declared.
For the Crown, Mr. Crystal submits that the issue involved in this appeal is a short point of construction and that there is simply no warrant for the suggestion that section 31 of the Act of 1968 embraces or was ever intended to embrace bankruptcy proceedings.
Section 31 relates to civil proceedings, inter partes, where a claim is made in relation to property which has been acquired in circumstances of an incriminating nature.
The normal privilege against self-incrimination is abrogated by the terms of section 31 in such proceedings.
Thus, for example, a defendant may be required to answer an interrogatory disclosing the whereabouts of property which has been surreptitiously acquired.
Bankruptcy proceedings, on the other hand, have no lis, they are not adversarial and the whole statutory scheme of bankruptcy has a different purpose and objective when compared with ‘civil proceedings’ properly so called.
The statutory scheme for bankruptcy is to be found in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency Rules 1986 and has the following main objectives:(1) to enable the bankrupt's affairs and dealings to be investigated under the control of the court;(2) to provide the statutory machinery for the collection and rateable distribution of the bankrupt's available assets (or those assets which ought to form part of his estate) with a view to satisfying his debts so far as may be practicable;(3) to rehabilitate the bankrupt through the process of discharge.
The privilege from self-incrimination is abrogated in bankruptcy proceedings not by the opening words of section 31 of the Theft Act 1968, but by rule 6.175 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 made pursuant to section 412 of the Act of 1986:
‘(1) The bankrupt shall at the hearing be examined on oath; and he shall answer all such questions as the court may put, or allow to be put, to him.
…(5) The written record may, in any proceedings (whether under the Act or otherwise) be used as evidence against the bankrupt of any statement made by him in the course of his public examination.
Thereafter section 433 of the Act of 1986 renders the evidence admissible.
In our judgment the submissions of Mr. Crystal are plainly right.
We do not regard section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 as a provision of general application subject to a special exemption created by section 31 of the Theft Act 1968.
Section 433 is concerned with the admissibility in evidence of a special class of document derived from insolvency in, as the section provides ‘any proceedings’(whether or not under the Insolvency Act 1986 or the Theft Act 1968).
This section is not concerned with privilege but with the admissibility of evidence, and in our judgment its terms are clear, unambiguous, unequivocal and not subject to any exceptions.
In the appellant's case his privilege against self incrimination was abrogated by the terms of the insolvency legislation to which we have referred.
Once that situation arose, then section 433 came into play.
Despite all Miss Arden's submissions, we are satisfied that section 31 of the Theft Act 1968 was not capable of providing this appellant with any protection.
We take the view that the judge was right to admit the evidence.
Accordingly, the appeal against conviction must be dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
Certificate under section 1(2) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 that point of law of general public importance involved in decision namely, ‘In criminal proceedings under the Theft Act 1968, is a statement or admission made by a defendant in bankruptcy proceedings admissible against the defendant?’
Leave to appeal refused.
