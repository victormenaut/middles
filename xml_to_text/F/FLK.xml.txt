Scottish women have spent a great deal of time discussing the pros and cons of being an older women, but what's it like being young in Scotland in nineteen ninety two?
Everyone here was born after nineteen sixty eight, the year of revolution according to someone.
The sixties were in full swing and we all lived, whether we like it or not, in a permissive society.
So here we are, the children of the revolution, what do they think of the world, of the Scotland that they live in?
That's what we'll discover tonight, and let's start with a question, a pretty straightforward one.
Are you enjoying life at the moment?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And, the majority, eighty three say yes!
Why?
Who said yes, and what are enjoying about it?
Yes?
That fact that in,a two years time I can go on to do the subjects that I want to do at the University in Scotland of my choice.
I will be able to do what and, law which is what I want, and I'll be able to practice it in Scotland  erm, which is something that I think's really, really good!
Okay.
Any more yes's?
Why?
Why are you enjoying life?
Or are they all private reasons?
Yes?


No, I've got another couple of years and then I'll be able to do what I like, when I like, with no parents on my back!
 
Do you know, what about the no's?
Who said no?
Why aren't you enjoying life?
Yep?
I still don't think there's enough sexual equality because erm, a couple of years ago I studied mechanics, and when I left college I found it very, very difficult to get on a mechanics course so I'm back again doing computing to try and get a job.
Would you prefer to be a mechanic?
Yeah, I would have in the first place, but it was just  impossible!
You know, nobody wants to take on a girl!
Seriously?
Yeah, honestly!
What about the computing?
I mean, is that gonna be easier?
Oh I like ,yeah, I like ma , you know computing but I would, I preferred mechanics.
Yeah.
What about th er, gender equality?
I mean, er er has anybody else had a similar experience?
I think it's actually got better.
I'm a second year  civil engineering student
Mhm.
at the moment, and I think I would be  some people would  not have let me do that, I think, in the past
Mhm.
but at the moment most of the people I know are saying, go for it!
Mm.
But do you think you'll get a job as a civil engineer at the end of it?
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yes?
I was doing veterinary for two years  and  I wrote away to companies but they just weren't all that keen to ge give girls a chance.
Is that a common experience?
Yes?
I'm actually a journalist, erm 
Mm.
I work in a newspaper that used to be male dominated and now  I would say three quarters of the wo , three quarters of the people on the news desk are now women.
Erm, doors are opening, slowly ,
Mm.
but they are opening for women now.
What difference do you think it makes that three quarters of the news desk are women?
Well it makes, it makes a difference in the content, it makes a difference in the topics that we cover, that we're interested in.
Erm, women don't just want to write about knitting, erm


baking  which 
Yeah.
one journalist, one famous Scottish journalist told me  when I wo , when I, when I had ambitions to be a journalists, oh don't go into journalism because you're a women and all you'll get to write about is fashion!
Mm.
But that is not the case, it's not the case.
Do you think readers notice the difference?
Yes.
Aha, I do.
We 
Why?
I mean we get enough letters about the, the, the pieces that our women write.
Yeah.
Up there.
Well I'm doing a one year course for drama and media performance and 
Yeah.
like  years gone past it's always been  male dominated but  this year, there's actually more girls taking it up.
None of these males  and, I found like, the tutor, he's a male, and he is really bad about  females being actors!
He, he picks on us to say how determined we are to actually go into the profession because he knows  that er, although there are more parts for females there it's harder for  somebody to stand out.
Mm.
Mm.
So although th th the equality of opportunity may be there the attitudes maybe haven't changed that much, or have they?
What do you think?
Yes?
Well I think  if you look at the main jobs in Britain, all the managers are  male, and I think it's, it's gonna change when we do have females and males in all these  erm, these jobs that are managing the main N H S, social work 
Mm.
all things like that.
Yes?
Erm sorry, just to come back, er I work for an amateur theatre company
Yep.
and really, I mean  you know, you can talk about male, female bias as much as you like but there's an awful of actresses, and not, you know, a lot fewer actors and a lot better parts for men.
And it's something which is difficult to cope with, but I work in a kind of environment where  it just is sexually biased, that's the way it goes!
It's not  something that can be changed, like maybe management  but erm  it's it's just that, you know, to be careful, that if you're doing these things, there's some things which, I think women can do, and a lot of things that women should be doing, maybe there's other things which just aren't there for them just now.
The thing we've all got to concentrate on, is the opportunity should be there, and they should be there for us 
Mm.
to do it, and it starts a lot earlier, it starts when you're at school and the fact that  that women are told that you can do, like home economics an , and sewing and all that, and then they're not encouraged to go into engineering courses.
And if that's gonna happen then how are women gonna be able to get on into higher education
Mm.
and how are they gonna be able to get the jobs?
The equality of opportunity and equal pay for work of equal value and all those things are  are are are issues which er  have been fought over for the last twenty years.
Now can I ask a self-indulgent question, I mean, how well do you think the women, ten, and twenty, and thirty years older than you have done  in, in achieving a better deal for women your age?
Up there?
Well I was given a really big chance  a while ago, it was by a single parent who was an editor of the community newspaper, I'm now the business and production manager, I'm a single parent, my wee boy's three.
She lets me take time off, I mean she's really understanding.
Yeah.
I think that's what we need is more understanding bosses.
But it was a women helping you?
Mhm.
That's a now I've had that experience.
May I ask you a, a voting question actually on that?
I wonder what you think?
Do you think at the moment women have equal opportunities in Scotland?
Do women have equal opportunities in Scotland?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And you'd be interested to know that eighty one of you say no!
The nineteen who said yes, where are you and why did you vote yes, there?
Who said yes?
Yes?
I don't think I've ever come up against sexism, except from in the classroom when the teacher to, the economics teacher tries to wind us up by saying women would should be chained to the kitchen sink!
But otherwise 
 
I've had all the opportunities I would want.
Okay.
Any other yes's?
Or do you think she's got something to  to find out later on?
Yes?
I think there's always exceptions, but I think  you've got to believe in yourself and go and do what you want to do  and if you're saying there's  opposition, there's gonna be more opposition, if 
Mm.
you've seen it there.
Mhm.
I know there is exceptions.
So it's not that you couldn't fe it's, it was it was actually you who weren't able to find the thing, rather than the thing wasn't available for you, that's the suggestion?
No because , I applied for a lot of jobs
Yep.
and I was better qualified than a lot of  guys in my class and yet they left college and got a job right away!
And, I applied for loads of jobs and  nothing ever came back.
Okay.
Let me ask you another question, or looking, looking towards the future.
Do you know what you're going to be doing in five years time?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And  thirty five of you say yes, sixty five no.
The sixty five who said no does it worry you that you don't know or is that quite exciting that you don't know what you're going to be doing?
Yes?
I think, as a student I don't know what I'm gonna do and with the present  erm grant system and bursary system it's it's even more frightening because es especially towards women, it does discriminate against women and that's why less women are going into higher education 
Mm.
or further education.
And with the whole child care  side of things as well, it is frightening!
As a, as a student are you managing to cope with er, very limited finances or
Well, I'm the women's officer in my college and I 
Right.
this is what I'm fighting for, I'm fighting for equal rights, and I'm fighting to get more women into  further education cos I think it's  it's a very basic that we all need to go into  and it's hard, and the openings aren't there women to go into, you've got to fight for it, yeah!
Yeah.
Erm, my mother calls me the eternal student because I tell her that there's absolutely no way I'm gonna look for full time employment!
But, now that, I mean I'm in the second year of being a student, and  I took on the position of women's officer for the we , for the west of Scotland area
Mhm.
and  I just don't want to move out of being a student because I find that, that more and more problems are, you know I'm coming up with because, like Melanie saying there  is problems with child care, there is erm positive discrimination against women, and we are  always discriminated on  the sexual harassment in the college is unbelievable and  we have to campaign against this and that's what's gonna keep me being a student.
Might be useful to find out how many here actually do have children.
Do you have children?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And, of this hundred fourteen of you have children.
Now, you may vote in fo on this question as well, do you have or want children?
Button one for yes, er and button two for no.
So if you've got children vote yes on that one, if you want children.
And, of this hundred  three don't knows, that seems reasonable.
Seventy six say yes!
That's something to be sure of, I don't think I was sure.
Twenty one say no and that's something to be sure of as well.
How do you know that you don't you twenty one who said no?
Yes?
I don't like children!
I don't get on with them!


I just don't get on with them.
I can't  talk to them or anything so 
You.
I don't want to be tied, I want to leave my options free so that I can do whatever I want, I don't need the extra responsibility, I mean  I'd like them but I just, I want my career first.
Mhm.
Of the yes's, and that's majority, the seventy six  when?
When do you fancy doing it?
Yes?


Er, the next seven years or after that  probably .
Not, so not till you're what?
Thirty odd?
Well, I'm only  nineteen just now !


Ah but
About twenty five, twenty six I think I'll 
Yeah.
sort of think about it then.
Yep?
Na , I mean answered a yes to that question, but I don't think it's a matter of do you want or do you no , cos I don't think the choice is there.
I think we have to be freed up to have the choice to bring children into a society where  that we can go to work, that we can do , you know fulfilling 
Mhm.
experiences and daycare and  you know, even in  er child care and so on.
I think, while I say that I want children, and do I have a child, that i , it's not made particularly easy.
Mm.
You have a job and  you do the things that kin a er, inspire you to go on, you know, you know with er any other opportunity.
Up there.
I have got two children and I'm hoping to go to college when my youngest daughter is three cos I can't get her, can't go until she is three cos the creche won't take them  until they're out of nappies and three year old.
Yeah.
But I'm desperate to go to college, I mean I love my kids and my kids get everything  they need, but I can't go, it's holding me back, I can't get  my two into the creche.
Do you think young men think at all about looking after children or or or child care?
I mean i in your experience is it something that you talk about at all with with with men?
Yes?
When I  done a Y T S course
Yep.
like  most of the  the child care was done by the girls, but there was actually a few  of the boys that decided they wanted to work in the nurseries and  o eh  the five that done, there's actually two that we know of a are actually doing child care as a career.
Really?
Yes.
Now, that is a change!
And I 
Yeah.
no man of my age who er, who who are doing child care or anything similar.
Any other er  any other views on this?
Yes?
My boyfriend said he would  stay at home and be the househusband and look after the children and do co co , the cleaning and cooking if I  stayed at work.
Does that appeal to you?
No.
I'd be quite happy to go to work if erm  if I had a good job and my boyfriend  stayed at home, that'd suit me fine!
If I could go out to work  and leave the child and  and do what I wanted to do, I'd be quite happy with that.
Is anybody living in that situation at the moment?
Are there are any er, there any, yes?
No, I just started a part-time job and my boyfriend's , come and watch them and he's helping me cleaning the house and everything's clean when I come home.
We just started last week on this  like that.
What one week in?
Well, it's every night but it's just a couple of hours a night.
Yeah, but I mean you're one week into the regime?
Yeah.
Yeah.
How's he doing?
Good !
Good, which  Yep?
Yep?
Er, I'm a  first year primary school stu 
Mm.
student and I've actually come across books now, that erm  don't say the mother cleans the house, it's always a father.
There is lots of books that I've got, either the father or the brother cleaning, and it's not just the mother and the daughter.
Yeah I I  what I'm a bit worried about is whether it's come to the stage where girls are now scared to put their name down to take home economics at school.
Because?
Because there's like th , the male dominated, like a male dominated in the class


it might never come to that stage.
Up there.
The thing is er, you can end up feeling like a bit of a, a failure, almost like a traitor to womankind if you do take courses that are traditionally female.
Mm.
Well I can remember whe when I was at school, physics and maths were clever subjects, they were male subjects.
When er, the headmaster when he was reading out the the subjects that people were taking for highers, and one girl was doing physics, maths and further maths, he said oh, one of our cleverer girls!
So the rest of us who were doing arts or humanities or whatever, weren't as clever because she was doing 
Mm.
the male subject.
Mm.
And I just think that that's the real danger.
Can I sa , I'll ask another question tha , since we're talking about erm  er, advances er  which at one time came under the general heading, feminism, would you call yourself a feminist?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And  four aren't sure  forty of you say yes, but the majority, fifty six say no!
Now, that's interesting!
Of the forty who said yes, what do you mean by that when you say you're a feminist?
Yes?
I think there's still a need for feminism today, there we 
How?
there were moves made in the sixties but I'm sure that the process is ongoing and we still 
Mm.
need  we still need feminists today.
Mm.
Yes?
Now some , somebody famous once said  erm, I'm called a feminist because I say things that is, to distinguish myself from a doormat.
And I think


and  the a the idea of of erm  the butch woman in dungarees, as being the feminist, erm  and the women that burnt her bra or whatever was a feminist of the seventies, but it doesn't mean to say that the ideas aren't still there, and I still want to be treated as an equal, but I do , I don't see  that I should change the way that I dress or the way that  that I want to act
Mhm.
because of that it's my ideals.
Mm.
Audrey?
I think it's possible that  a lot of the women here are saying no because of the stigma that's attached to the word  feminist  feminism.
The words the , I mean it has always been stigmatized by men, lesbians,and, you know everything 
Mhm.
else, and I think that people have to got sort of clarify what feminism is, and what  sort of what aspects of it they want to take on.
There.
Erm, I'd like to say Sheena that I, I think it was a difficult question that you asked, are you a feminist?
Cos it's  it's puts it do , I know you were saying about it's difficult to answer yes or no to a question but i in this case it's really true because  I answered no but I've I've got erm  I mean I've I've got a degree in politics and I studied er, I did a a course women in politics
Mm.
and I've re I have quite a high awareness about women's position in society, but  because of that I feel that I've  now come to reject the term feminism because  erm  I think it's also harming the people who, you know, it's harming the women that are holding on to that er, label because it is label  and that is erm  because it's, because it's a label it then  it's blocking er forms progress for women.
And er  I think, I I agree, I agree with a lot of the demands that feminist women have made  but, to kind of congregate it in that way, it's bu , I mean a lot of wha er, white feminists have been attacked for  excluding black women, and that's one of the examples where  you know, to be, to say that you're a feminist, it's not just men that you're alienating, you're also alienating other way.
How interesting!
Yes?
I think feminism was something that was very necessary from, from the last generation and we're now standing on the 
Mm.
shoulders of the last generation 
Mhm.
but we need to make a lot of changes with this concept of feminism.
And, and really erm, develop something new, something that's going to be more equal, something that won't discriminate against men  and something that er, that isn't associated with  with  some more ridiculous aspects of
Mhm.
of the things that have been associated with feminism.
So is it, is it as much the word as the philosophy?
I mean, you suggested the philosophy, you suggested that the term has become devalued because of unfortunate associations which may have been imposed by, by men.
I think it is as much that the word is a philosophy, but I don't think we should throw it out of the window altogether, like I say, it's a foundation, it's our  our foundation stone.
History.
Yes?
I have a certain degree of sympathy for men because I think you have to take into consideration that men aren't given enough opportunity to feel se , er sympathetic, maybe again is the wrong word
Mhm.
but to feel sorry for women and put their view forward because, I mean, you still the situation of a Friday when men go down to the pub and you know they're all Jack the Lad!
Men are frightened to put forward their opinion.
I mean, if a man cries he's considered a wimp!
It's erm, even back to school, I mean boys wear blue, girls wear pink, if you see a boy with pink i , you know he's classed as cissy, er, cissy or wimp things like that.
I don't think men are given enough room to express their emotions and feelings about things.
Up there.
I think it's men that use feminism, or feminist in a derogatory term
Mm.
and it shouldn't be.
It's something I'm very proud to say that I am, cos I believe in equal rights and that's what feminism is, is believing in equal rights for women.
I mean, I think every women sho , here should be proud to say they're a feminist if they believe in equal rights for  theirself , and it's only men that use in the derogatory way.
Mhm.
Yes?
Erm what I wanted to say is, erm, in response to the lady in the red, was that a lot of feminists have a lot to answer for because, in the sense, men erm can be discriminat , well not discriminated but we can say things about men which are generalizations, whereas if a, one man says one generalized thing about a woman, then he's just, you know chauvinists is everything, and he's got a really bad name to him, so I think it's got to be looked at from both sides.
I mean, I'm definitely a feminist, but I'm not a man hater, but I mean I think everyone's looking for the new term and
Mm.
exactly as Alice  said, the new term is womenist, not feminist.
And,a a I mean I think we have, you know, to be feminists because we don't want to be better than men, we just want to be equal.
Mhm.
Wanna be a person then!
I I think erm 
 
this is a good word because it  well it's not because of the associations but it stresses the femininity and that's what a lot of  the sixties feminists lost, I think was their  own femininity because they saw it as man's  imposition 
Mm.
of femininity onto them.
I think it's far too early to give up the term feminist.
I think, we've still got so much to do, to to get to equality  it's too early to give it up.
And I know it's important to be equal in careers and  to have equal opportunities and I'm not arguing against that, but I also think that perhaps, in doing so some women  also lose the pride in  being a woman, and  e equality isn't being a man, which I think some feminists take that view, that they're not equal to a man unless they're earning money.
But that staying at home and looking after the children, or whatever and bringing up a family is  just as  valuable as a job, or a career.
Mhm.
Erm, I don't think equality is being a man, I have no desire to be a man.
Erm, but we've talked a lot about erm labels being
Mm.
negative and excluding people, but I also think that labels  can be very, very positive and very, very important and that's, I think that's why  erm, people thought up the word feminism and yeah, okay we have to think about the word and we have to think about what it means for us so  yeah, a lot of pe , er people don't want to call themselves feminists because the label has such negative connotations, but it does also mean very positive things, it's a way of bringing people together, it's a way of  supporting each other, it's, you know it's, brings solidarity to the movement  and people need labels.
I thi , because the society does want to categorise people so easily and so quickly  erm, it's  it's a very, erm  easy, quick way of erm, knowing where stand.
Yeah, I think it's important like in the nineties  that we're facing, not like the the legal inequalities that we're, the, faced, the generation, the sixties  but we're facing attitudes that are  not 
Mm.
changing.
We've now got sexual equality in theory, and  pay, and jobs and status and stuff, but we're facing attitudes which are much more harder to change.
We've talked quite a bit about the, I suppose th th th the women's side of er, of this programme's title, what about the Scottish side?
Right at the beginning someone said they were enjoying life at the moment because they were able to do what they wanted to do in Scotland.
Now, I wonder how many of you, er  are expecting to stay in Scotland?
Let me ask you that question.
Do you hope to stay in Scotland?
I mean, with forays abroad, I dare say, but would you expect the rest of life to be spent in Scotland, or based in Scotland?
And   those same three people keep abstaining, it's amazing!


Sixty two say yes, thirty five no.
Of the no's, would you like to say why you voted no?
Yes?
Basically because the weather's terrible here and I'd  like to move abroad !
 
So you're gonna be heading for the sun?
Yeah.
Spain !
Yeah.
Okay, any other?
Er, yes?
I have a strong interest in languages, and although now we are trying to teach more languages in school, even in primary schooling, I don't feel that within er  my, I'm only eighteen at the moment, by the time I'm twenty five things still won't have came far enough along for me to utilize this skill.
I would probably end working in Europe as well 
Mhm.
because there's no job opportunities over here, it's  a lovely country but  it's simply because of the work factor.
So you'll be a civil engineer abroad?
Yeah !
Right.
Well of course there's a great tradition of Scots leaving Scotland and and maybe there's nothing wrong with that, I mean, there's there's no shame in leaving is there?
I mean, of those of you who want to stay, the sixty fi , the sixty two  er wha , why do you want to stay?
I love Scotland and I wouldn't leave.
Par partly because I'd get homesick, and I just love the whole of Scotland!
I mean, I could go from anywhere, Lowerick down to the borders and I'd  I'd be, I'd feel at home, but I wouldn't feel  I mean, I went down to  England for something like four days, and like from Berwick,ma , about it must be about ten miles from Berwick to the Scottish, the Scotland thing and I was a  craning my head out the bus window to see it!




I was, I just love Scotland so much!
Yes?
I feel a sense of loyalty, that after erm  the  education department has paid four years for me to
Mhm.
learn my trade that I ought to stay here and put something back into the industry again.
What's your trade?
Erm, I'm in  government manufacturing.
Right.
And, I'd like to stay up here and  sort of keep the industry going.
Yes?
That's a very important point!
It's sad to see that so many people feel that they have to move away.
And job situation maybe is that, but I think we should stay here and fight, and demand that we have the industries up here so that people from Scotland can stay and better, better  theirselves here  rather than move away.
Mhm.
So far I've really enjoyed my life  well no major complaints anyway, and so I'd like to bring my children up here enjoying their life as well.
Mhm.
Stu , I mean I live in Glasgow, the chances of me leaving Glasgow are pro ,pre pretty slim but  yeah, I certainly don't want to stay in Scotland because of any loyalty, that I don't think it's given me very much other than a lot of experience, a lot of struggle, a lot of opportunities  to stand alongside  working class people and fight against, you know, the injustices.
But I think I'll stay here  but I see myself as a internationalist as well.
I think that the money that is actually getting put into Scotland in tourism, I mean I come from Sterling and 
Aha.
it's, Sterling is gonna be quite, really good  in the future for jobs and for everything.
Erm, I just love Sco Scotland, I think it's got a lot to offer, it's beautiful place!
I don't think I would leave Scotland within the the near future because I love Iron Bru too much, and I  wouldn't get in some other places or  
 
Yes?
Well, I know there are like, problems for women, they're discriminated against, but I think if you've got the drive and the motivation I think you can overcome these problems.
Mm.
Ah, hands always go up when I'm about to finish the programme and you've been so 
 
I'll give you a er, just a couple.
Yes?
It's actually women of our age group that has gotta take the responsibility for to make changes, so that women in the next generation have got that opportunity that we did nah have till now  and that's the whole point of it.
Aha.
I was just gonna say, we've been talking about equality a lot tonight
Mm.
and although things may not be brilliant for, in the workplace at the moment, but we're we're making a move, we're getting a, a foot in there.
In years to come they're gonna be the managers  so hopefully we can make it better for someone else.
A great positive note on which to end, and so we must I'm afraid.
Thank you very much indeed!
Thank you for joining us.
Goodbye.
