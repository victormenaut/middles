These are questions that I'd like to ask you from what you've told me so far, erm, I'd like to ask you Mr  about erm, from your point of view, from your erm experience with the electrical 
Yeah 
business about light fittings.
I like to ask you both about your experience of moving into Harlow and of living in this house, which is a totally separate set of questions 
Mm, mm 
erm, why I suppose that's two completely different questions and I'd like to ask you from your point of view, from your point of view 
I don't think there's a very great deal in the way of er lighting fittings one can talk about erm in houses in Harlow, it's er, there's a, a distinct difference between the light, a lot, lot of architects in, in Harlow have lived in Harlow you see and they will go in for all the very latest type of lighting fittings erm and because they have er access to the books for the various er designers of lighting fittings er, generally though, they, the majority of the people in the town er have come from er London boroughs and erm they view the same kind of lighting fittings they've always been used to.
I mean when I started with a shop in Harlow what, erm, nearly twenty five
Thirty
nearly thirty years ago, erm, we used to sell the old glass bowl fitting on er three chains, hanging from the ceiling and that, and I used to buy those in a crate of about fifty at a time, and er most of the houses had two lighting points in the lounge anyway so, and they'd always wanted a pair and we used to have them in the shop on a display so that about eight of them could all be lit up at once and people could see them and if they didn't like those then the, we could always put another one under the set if we'd got one in a certain colour, we could hang one of those up and er they could look at that and see what it looked like.
Can I go back and ask you two questions.
One, what were the differences when you say that they chose them, so even though the basic shape was the same there were obviously some, there were some variations?
Oh yes, erm I think it was generally, er, they had to match the colouring of the rooms that they'd got, the furniture they'd got really because as far as the room was concerned er when, when the, new houses came onto the erm, ready for occupation, er they were all cream coloured inside and anyway and pale cream  so  they, they'd got er any choice they wanted there it, really it was just to match their curtains, match their carpets, all their furnishings and erm, of course I suppose they, the rose coloured ones er went better than say the lemon coloured one and that because er people just er liked the idea of moving into a place that's got a nice cosy glow in it, place sort of thing, but we never sell any at all, there's, none of that type of fitting in, sold now.
When do you think that that erm stopped being popular?
Oh I, I should think that about fifteen years ago er when erm the lighting manufacturers had decided that er there was a great deal more available in lighting than just the erm, type of glass bowls and shades that had been used, well in between the wars er, I mean after the war was over in nineteen forty six er they were still using the same things that they did before the war and this just carried on er and er it, it only within the last what I suppose fifty years that's over  
In the late sixties 
Yes
people were still using these sort of light fittings?
oh yes, yes, erm it's very difficult to say I think when it actually exactly fades out, it would be, it would be fifteen years ago anyway, er when one used to find that there, there were no more of these being bought at all 
Yes and apart from you, you mention lemon and rose, what other colours were there, can you remember?
Oh yeah, you'd, some people would go for some very awkward colours, er green, which is a terrible colour, blue which is another awkward colour, I mean I even get people today asking for blue lamps for their bedrooms, erm I'm sure they can't read in bed at that rate er, erm, it's an awful colour to use erm and er  I suppose
Orange
yes, any colour you can think of, I mean erm, blue I think is one of the worse, but thinking of lampshades we used to sell a lot of er lampshades for putting on table lamps er and erm, we'd have just about every colour and somebody would come along and say well erm haven't you got one in purple  and of course I'd refrain from saying thank god no I haven't
erm, and er, sometimes even pleased to say well I'll try to get you in purple, but er, nowadays erm, we, we don't go in for that because there's, there's so many er shops now that selling lighting fittings erm and selling nothing else, there isn't one actually in Harlow, but there's one in Epping and there's one in Stortford, erm that er, it's, it's riding a new car people want to see er a good variety of them, have a look at a lot or a washing machine or anything like that, you want to see many before you buy one.
But, but in the fifties you were probably one of the only shops in Harlow that sold 
Oh yes at one time erm after the New Town got well started, after The Stow was built got to the, goes up to The Stow and be beyond er, well it's just, going on into erm, er, towards the swimming bath, it wasn't up there, swimming bath, erm and we used to call it the Shady Shop in, in adverts and er we used to have a lot of people used to come down because there was only The Stow then and er
And you had your shop 
we 
in The Stow?
Oh no, no way, my shop's in Old Harlow always has been
It's always been
Oh yes, yes, erm the er, no I, I suppose when The Stow first started we
When you saying, you saying that people had two points in their lounge
Yes, it was, yes, yes 
was this an open plan
Er
sitting and dining area?
yes, well I don't know, I suppose that nearly all er the houses in Harlow you could say are open planned now, you know had a, had er, a, kitchen dining area that we have, erm or erm lounge, diner, erm they haven't gone in, in this, the ordinary houses, they haven't gone in for building
Can I go back to, I know I keep on harping back, but this about the actual designs of the light fittings, erm you've told me that erm invariably the ceiling er lighting position was fixed by, being in the centre unless it was an open plan
Yeah
with the dining room at one end and a sitting room at the other in which case you had two light, ceiling light 
Yes, that's right , yes
erm and that the number of sockets changed
Yes it started off at er twelve sockets in these house and that er, it must of gone down to about er eight sockets in some houses.
And when you say these houses, the, the number of rooms and that in those sort of houses would be how many?
Well again er, er a three bedroomed house, I would, you see and they were putting one plug in, in, in each, each bedroom and, and two plugs in the main bedroom so they dropped one down altogether and erm, erm in a lounge like this to put two plugs in, sort of one in that corner and one in that corner it's no good to anybody, it's, as much as anything else was er, er about placing plugs as well er, if one's only going to have two plugs well then least one should be able to place them in, in the right positions, er putting them behind doors is, is, is no good at all, a lot of them have been done that way because the it always means flex is going to be draped across the, the door if people are walking in gonna trip over it and erm, they probably got down to now, something er just less than the  standard I would think in the, in the last houses they built.
Did they put double ones in or just single sockets?
Well only in the last er two years I would think, perhaps two and a half years er had they really started putting double plugs in everywhere instead of single plugs
How many of, erm, did you ever come across a house with only one socket in a living room?
In a living room, no, no
Always at least two?
Two yes, at Potter Street there was erm, er houses built with two plugs in and that really wasn't any good at all and that was in erm a living room where there would be er, a dining living room as well
Yes
because the kitchen wasn't large enough and er, and the two plugs in the kitchen as well and that's just not good enough
Yes
for me
Can we go back to the, very quickly to, er to the review of the design of the light fittings in the fifties and sixties, you mentioned the pleated paper ones which were close to the ceiling
Yes
plastic ones which were close to the ceiling, can you, could you give me a bit more of a description of that or perhaps a manufacturer's name?
Well, I, I think that probably erm, when we started out, er, it
again after the war, in this country, they erm, the lighting manufacturers never got round to it, there are too many er, there's, there was too much call for er lighting in offices, shops, schools and that sort of thing and er, so a lot of the idea did come from abroad at first, the er Fin 
shades they were made in Finland they were the paper pleated ones, er, most of them, no, no not most of them, a lot of them fitted er close up onto the ceiling where they're intended for centre lights and were held up onto the ceiling with a little spring, erm, they also did some quite nice pleated paper shades, er at a time when you find that most electrical shops were, would have er the old type of erm what is it, imitation silk shades with fringes round them, er fringe at the top and fringe at the bottom and so on sort of thing, when the, when those was sort of old of age everywhere, it was just the same as it'd been before the war, er it was, you know, quite right really to see these all in different colours, completely plain, but pleated shades but in just one particular colour each shade.
Was the inside of the shade white or did it, did the light glow through and  
The glow through, er yes the paper was erm, was the same colour all the way through and er, and erm they had quite an impact, but of course they, would only last a year or two er and er  they started a small factory in London and, erm call it Hula-Hoops I think er, I don't know whether Hula-Hoops came from the lighting shades or the lighting shades from the Hula-Hoops, but it was the same process that made them both and er this was erm thin plastic tubing brightly coloured, er which was er cemented together into er 
Sponge 
er beehive shapes and er
Yeah
Round
and erm circular shapes, that sort of thing.
Like hanging lanterns?
Yes
Yes, yes
they were very attractive actually
They were very attractive and they did have the advantage that you could take them down and plunge the whole thing in water and wash it and er
And they were popular a lot of people bought them 
Oh yes, yeah 
Oh yes, yes 
sold an awful lot of them
there must of been a thousand thousands sold of this, done I should think
Mm
and erm then some of the people like er  er in London started out erm making shades or er fittings which were erm quite at home in the house er or in the office and erm these were, well that is one design of them the wall back is to match you see, er but you could equally er, put those into erm hotel bedroom or something or er hotel lounge somewhere there, erm or you can get them large with more lamps in them I think and all sorts of new designs were coming out mainly in, in plastic er and erm
That
er they also brought out some a good range of lighting fittings er, which you still see about again used well I, I remember putting one, you saying about putting lights at different levels, erm a staircase which was in a new house which was architect design and built and erm, the staircase was er more or less centrally in the house rather than be stuck against one wall and so it had a well and down the centre of the well we strung one of these lights with er five different glasses suspended on black flex five black flexes and erm these were shades made of heavy glass er the glass wasn't painted it was coloured all the way through, er and erm they were called er Chelsea, Chelsea glasswork and erm these each had a lamp inside them well  er about three inch diameter cylinders actually about eight inches long and they were hung at different heights er so that the lip behind the staircase and also of course there's a staircase being where it was, it was in the centre of er, a, quite a large hallway for modern stand for modern standards and erm it of course was a feature of the hall as well.
So it became not only erm practical thing but the light fitting became a decorative
Oh yeah, yeah 
Oh very much so 
Do you think that there was a changeover from being practical, I mean can you remember seeing that transition from the very practical shade to the, to, to the light fitting becoming something decorative?
Oh I think that occurred about erm, I mean now the, the trend is for long erm chromium stems you know with lights coming out of all different angles and they are very decorative in a very modern house and that will be 
But do you think that in the fifties already this sort of trend was something 
I don't think so , I think this is 
I think this is more in the sixties really
this is in the sixties 
erm 
seventies, sixties, seventies 
fifties , all I can remember there was an all very stolid erm, people didn't know where they were yet, and erm, it er 
I, I I was so 
it was still in the sixties, they call it the swinging sixties, I mean I didn't see anything swinging in the sixties at all, I didn't think it was swinging, but er and they don't like now the swinging sixties and I think really it was then that er people did er branch out to new ideas.
These Rotaflex ones that you spoke of, were they in the fifties or the early sixties?
Early sixties
Yes
I see 
Oh no in the, in the fifties we were on the erm, the glass bowl fittings, yes 
On the glass bowl fittings 
Yes , yes, do you think that one of the reasons that they, that they became less popular apart from fashion was that, that they, erm wo that, that you had, the way that you cleaned them, that they caught the dust or
Oh no 
Well that , that could be an idea but I think people would put up with that I, I think it was just because they were, then old fashioned.
When you say glass bowl, do you mean like the gold fish bowl?
That was
Like, yes, the gold fish bowl on chains, they're hanging down on chains 
No it, it they hang on three chains er and er
s s some of them
yeah, about that shape sort of thing you see, like that 
Yes, yes , did they have a kind of marbled
Yes, yes all sorts of different things, all 
Oh yes, marbled, painted and all sorts of things on them, yeah 
We used to get them by the, twenty at a time all sorts of, because people just absolutely loved 
So when people first moved in they 
these things
Yes, was it because you think that, they, that's what they had for in the house
 
Oh yes that's what they remembered, yes, yes 
They would remember from London you see
er and erm, I, I think that er  most people are erm 
Dougal you have made a smell you are a naughty boy
Er, I think most people now are influenced really by what they know at home er, and erm, today, yet that today they're, they're far more er adventurous and they're far more prepared, prepared to erm try out new ideas and see what they like
Mm
although we did notice, I mean, it and this will be during the er sixties anyway that erm, er the various new types of fittings that came out on er several of the London manufacturers were erm stepped up really weren't they you know 
Oh yes, yes 
the adjustable types of fittings and er, and in, it all really led up to what people are going for now in, in their houses, they want spotlights, erm clipped on, screwed on the ceiling, screwed on the walls er 
Eye ball fittings in the ceilings
all this sort of thing you see 
all that sort of thing 
And that's what we're selling more of now than anything else er and I, I think it's quite a good idea really, light up the things that you like in the house, er and erm, not the things you don't like.
Do you think that the idea of a adjustability er you say that they were snapped up, do you think that people actually once they get an adjustable light fitting, do you think that they actually adjust it?
Do you think that they move it around?
Or do you 
Oh I , I would think so
Some do, er the rise and fall type of fitting over a dining table where when you're er, er having dinner you'd have erm it down to about what not more than twelve inches above the table er so that it lit the table but didn't shine in your eyes, erm some people leave it like that all the time, other people having had a meal lift er it up, erm I think the main thing about the, er adjustable fly and fall is that erm, it's there for, as you want it, if you're trying to find a meal you've lost on the floor well then you pull it down to floor level really.
When in, when you had the erm, you put your ceiling lights on
Yes
in the erm living room, or dining lounge, what other light fittings did people buy apart from that, if they did at all?
Oh, usually er for bedrooms er they, they would have erm 
Bedside lights
decorated type of shades, erm usually nowadays in, in plastic but erm 
But I mean in the actual downstairs, in the living room 
Did have table lamps 
Table lamps
Yes, I mean 
Standard lamps?
Oh aye, in the early days, yes, standard 
Not much in the way of floor standards now, erm I don't think there's many floor standards sold nowadays
But I mean in the fifties, sixties 
but, we, oh we used to sell a lot of floor standard 
Oh in the fifties yes, yes, oh yes 
Yes
wooden ones yes, yes, yes 
With large you know
large shades on them
Traditional or again modern?
Er well both, mainly traditional turned wood 
Oh mainly traditional, turned wood of yes
or and then we used to have some gorgeous lamps that er we used to get in Chelsea that it was fasten on the wall and the lamp would come over on the shade, down and completely change, do you remember that?
Oh yes, yes
That sounds like a modern one
Very modern, yes
And those were bought and
Oh very much so, yes, this was in the sixties, sixties, seventies
Can you remember the make of that, like?
Oh blimey we used to go to Chelsea and buy them 
Those, no, no, no I think the one you're thinking of, the brass tube
It was a brass tube
made by the same people who made that one there actually 
that was  then that's  then 
Yes I think it was  that's right, yes
cos it's just got another shade on it 
It came up on the wall like that and had a big wooden block fastened to the wall that block 
That's right, yeah 
so you could pull it up and down and the effects went out the bottom of the tube, the tube came up like that and it came over, and like that and then the shade would be like that and then you could swing it round 
Swing it round 
Yes
 
Did you , did you get any ideas from the Design Centre about what fittings to buy?
Oh yes we used to go to the Design Centre, yes 
Oh yes we used to go to the Design Centre at Haymarket er and erm, see what they had and see what was going, yes
It sounds as if you were both involved in the shop?
Oh yeah
Yes, yes, yes.
Excuse me I get a Polo Mint
I was going to say shall I make, would you like a cup of coffee?
Now please tell me if I'm keeping you, I know I've been here for a very long time 
No, are you, are you worried about your time because 
That, that they have garages 
Excuse me 
and outside the porches, to light their number up outside their house, erm people don't seem to have erm, really changed their ideas very much, we still sell the same type of fitting to people, er the one that goes over the garage doors, on the corner of the, of the house wall, er lanterns er outside the front door with coloured glass in them er things that have been going for
Come on sweety
forty, fifty years really 
come on 
Do you think that there's a fashion in light fittings, I mean you've noticed the change 
There's a definite fashion of yes, yes, the only thing is, is that people are not erm, er  religious bound by the fashion, they don't, sort of say like well I think we'll have to change our porch light it looks old fashioned compared to the one next door, erm
What about in lounges?
In lounges?
Well again I, I, I think that er, wall lighting is a, is a thing
Now?
er now
Mm
and really always has been, erm, the idea of a centre is, is simply because you consider how much it costs to have a point wired when the house is, is built, er several people nowadays is ha well they buy an old house, they erm, say well we'll take out the centre light and put us in some wall lights instead you see.
But as far as the Harlow Corporation Housing are concerned mostly 
They never put in any wall lights in at all 
Well when you say wall lights do you mean brackets wall brackets?
These, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yes
yes, we, we put those in there you see
Yes
very soon after we got here, but er the Corporation never put any wall light in houses
did you ever have a desire of er a wall bracket where you didn't have to chase in the flex that it actually ran up from er a socket in the wall?
Oh yes, yes, er we've got one upstairs in one of the bedrooms now.
Did, were they popular?
Erm  I, I can't say that we sold a lot of them I, I, and I haven't seen a lot about at all, er it's a very good idea I mean two, there's mainly two different types, one that was held up by pins which was, was quite good er and erm  and there was another one which was held up by erm a pin which ran, which the flex ran through, a stud rather than a, a pin and er two little black legs on it, was very good.
Can you remember the make of that?
Er, oh that particular one was one of  erm I don't know if they've even got a lighting showroom in London now, er
Do you have any of their old catalogues, have you kept any old catalogues?
Er lighting I think I've got some old lighting catalogues, yes
Because I would be very interested to photograph some of them if I may?
Oh yeah, yeah, mm, mm, mm, mm, yeah, erm, yes I've got quite a lot of catalogues really I 
Do you have any
the trouble is not having enough modern catalogues of, of things that you can actually buy today because when they manufacturer them now they don't erm make catalogues as often as they used to do er, it costs so much money in it  I'd er, I, I think that probably the next trend is going to be in lighting fittings er which will take in er you er, low energy lamps er, at the erm, the new fluorescent lamps er where erm, well there's one in the hall which takes eight watts and it's given us as much light out as a hundred watt lamp, er and 
And it uses less power?
Yes, it uses eight watts against a hundred, well I say probably against seventy five, eight watts instead of seventy five and given us the same amount of light out.
Are people concerned about erm saving on the electricity bill?
I think everybody now 
I mean from the lighting point of view as opposed to things like heating and obviously more expensive consumption.
Er, well certainly erm as far as erm er, obviously as industry's concerned they're extremely worried about it 
But what about in houses?
In houses I don't think that people, er worry much about, about that erm 
Do , do you think they used to in the fifties?
I think they didn't like a lot of bright light in the house in the fifties, er and of course before that and er now that people they've got such good lighting in the offices where they work that they feel that, well they can't bear to poor lighting at home  and yet there are still people who will watch a colour television with er no lights on in the room at all 
Really?
Yes, next do , er which I think is terrible I mean er it's enough to make one
Because it's not necessary any more with er modern televisions is it?
Oh no, no, it's not necessary no, no, we have all these lights on just like this and we 
Yes 
when that's on
well it's not necessary
Yeah
Mm
Oh no, there's no need to have it in the dark, you can see alright with it.
When you spoke about the colour shades
Yes
erm, the coloured pleated shades that came from 
Yes
can you remember the, the colours that they were in?
Oh er, usually pale er, pale pink er again the ever  cream colour which seem to, you could of painted the fifties with cream I think, erm and erm  pale blue, powder blue colour er, they were all pale colours, er pale yellow or an amber colour, they had to be pale otherwise they wouldn't let the light through
Mm
erm, it's only in, in things like the Chelsea glassware er of  where you could really get, really strong colours er because of the thickness of the glass that they used
Mm
er and erm the fact that the colour was in the glass not on the glass.
When people came in to choose a light fitting, how often do you think that they considered what they wanted the light for, or whether they liked, or whether they choose it because they liked the style of the design of the light fitting?
I think that generally they came in because they liked the style erm they, they, usually had er, in their minds what they wanted and because they go round and see all these fittings at night, I mean our shop used to be all the fittings were lit up at night so that you could have a look in, erm it's very confusing I think when you, you've got an awful lot of fittings in, in, in a shop and, and all of them lit, decide which one's gonna to be the best for your house, but I think most of them already had ideas what, what sort of fitting they wanted and of course we used to do a great deal of 
Could you put down 
getting fittings especially for people, it 
I'm gonna put this chair for you because I'm sure you
thank you
Do sit on my
Yes this is better
A little high there
Then I, I er seen fittings in er, in a friend's house or they'd seen them in the erm 
Dougy stop it 
glossy magazines, of course 
Did they ever say to you I don't want a diffused light I want a direct light?
Mm, well, yes then I should put them off it, erm
But I mean did they, did they have specific, erm did they, did they have that kind of idea about the type of light they wanted or
Sugar Dougy, come here 
did they, or did they just like, did they just look at the colour and the shape of it, and the style of it?
Oh I, I think one had to consider erm, I, I'd have to ask them the size of the room, what, what sort of a room it was, er, it was no use getting the fitting which erm was either far too big for the room in it's, in it's physical size
Mm, mm
or perhaps which er wouldn't give up, wouldn't give out enough light
Mm
erm otherwise you'll 
Do you take sugar?
I do yes please
They'll be soon back again 
How much?
One please
Just one?
Yes
It's a very small spoon 
Thank you , that's fine
Have a biscuit or not?
I will thank you.
This'll be very hot I expect
It is
Mm
fairly
and
I'm sorry if Dougy's a
but it's one of his great problems  
No don't worry really I'm used to animals
it's okay
Good 
Erm, it interests me very much how people choose er not only in light fitting, but how you choose furniture and they choose designs generally, because I have a theory that er a lot of people don't consider the practical things, maybe as much as you know like you or me when we're conscience of that sort of thing 
Yes quite, yes 
No, cold , er one example of that is for instance erm an Anglepoise lamp
Yes
a standard Anglepoise lamp er which it's been going for a number of years, you can get it in about six different colours to match different designs of, er put colour into your room, now if somebody was spending a lot of time sitting knitting and has to look at the knitting or has to look at the pattern then er a good strong light which won't get in their eyes but goes straight on to what, whatever they're doing, is by far the best thing for them, er but they say oh I don't like it, it's a bit angular isn't it, erm, modern sort of thing, er but because it's angular it doesn't mean to say it's not gonna fit into the room it's the right thing for it, er for the person doing that work.
Do you think it's because it doesn't look domestic enough maybe it looks a bit industrial or
Yes I think if it had a few 
I think so, mm, mm 
if it had a few twists and curls round it and little things like that and bits of gold plate on it I mean that they'd go for it, but er, because it's made for its purpose and don't want it.
Yes, mm
And yet we always do sell them, er we always have Anglepoise lamps in the shop
I've still got this one, thank you 
Do you want 
We're about the only people in, in Harlow that do sell the Anglepoise lamps
Yes
Yeah, now they've become very erm, there's nothing exciting in the lighting shops in Harlow now, at all.
Do you think that designs in the fifties and sixties that there was more variety?
Oh there was a tremendous variety, but then there were all the same in, erm you look at the er the three light fitting er it hangs down from the ceiling and has three branches out from it and it either has three lights hanging down or three hanging upwards, er with four ordinary bulbs in or candle bulbs in and shades, sometimes they have four, erm, there's still an awful lot of those about and any lighting shop you look in you'll still see plenty of those er and yet they've got a tremendous number of disadvantages, one thing, a lot of them got glass shades, if you break one shade three year's time you might as well throw away the fitting because  you can't get another one  er, and erm  it's a design that doesn't, it doesn't lend itself to giving a good lighting in a room at all er, it they, they harsh glassware, the edges of the glass during all round the room and that sort of thing
Mm
doesn't help  I think that 
 
erm plastic erm, er the new plastics erm always give much more scope to lighting fittings, erm than the, the glass in the past but erm 
Well erm from, from my observation of catalogues and I was just looking through  the other day, lighting doesn't alter very much, there's nothing very impressive in any of the catalogues really
No but on the other hand you can look back and you can see all the things that have gone, I mean the  for instance which er 
Oh yeah , mm
somebody bought in large quantities er in Finland and started making up in a factory in Harlow erm, at one time, erm, they're all a bit 
I think that period was nice
Yes a lot of those about er, and, erm also the Rotaflex shades
Mm
er
Mm
and erm, a lot of the  types of fittings and single pendants with heavy coloured glasses on and things like that
Mm, I liked those
they were, they were all, all going, people had them, but er you don't see them nowadays 
No, it's gone quiet do you
Mm
know there doesn't seem to be any er great enthusiasm for new designs at the moment.
Do you think that the spotlights have
Yes I think so 
taken over?
Oh yeah, yeah 
The modern part of the 
yeah people have seen them at the discos and, will do, and er even, even those that gives patterns or designs people are buying, have in the house now instead of watching television, sit and watch the pattern on the wall er, but erm
Oh no
Oh yes they're, they're old, they're going down as well, yes, mm
I couldn't bear it
No, but er, I don't know people, it's, it's where people get their ideas from I think for a start, I know one time we used to sell oh a lot of erm spotlights and spotlamps, but only to people who were running discos, er now erm there are people who erm, well they, they want a, a couple in the lounge or something like that or, and er, and then of course they, there's others who erm have them outside and light up their trees, at night.
Well a lot of people now, a lot, I mean I've known several, they put er lamps underneath plants to make, it's very effective that 
Mm 
I like it
Mm if you have some nice 
if it's got a nice 
autumn weather of course Rosie
it can sit outside and
No, I mean them indoor, indoor plants David
Oh indoor plants, oh
Yeah
mm, mm, yes.
Could you tell me a little bit about when you first moved to Harlow, because it interests me very much the fact, I didn't, I wasn't aware that you lived in a, house that was 
Well I came 
built by the Corporation
Mm, I came to Harlow with my parents, when my husband was in the Air Force
During the war?
Mm and we moved from Sussex, here 
The last one of course 
Pardon?
The last one
The last one, yes 
The last one , not the great one 
and er, it was bad enough the, the last one, erm, and I started with the Corporation when they opened at Turlings in that, that was in nineteen forty eight 
Oh yes well I mean, I, I, I came back from the war 
Aye, so 
of course erm then we were living with your parents weren't we?
my husband and yes, just a minute , my husband arrived home from the war in nineteen forty eight I think it was or was it nineteen forty seven?
Good lord no, it was nineteen forty six ,a er March nineteen forty six
Mm, beg your pardon
the war ended in forty five you know
Yeah forty six 
I thought that was bad enough having to stay another year
Anyway, forty six and then we had no house, at all, because my mother had died and my father, we said to my father you leave if you want to we should be alright we'll find somewhere to go and we didn't and we had to have a Nissan hut for about a year, supplied by the Council 
It was accommodated by the soldiers before wasn't it?
which had been occupied by soldiers, this was our first hut, well by then I was working for the Corporation and of course by virtue of my job with the chief architect I got this house and we were offered this house about two years later for two thousand pounds and we said oh we wouldn't be staying here for more than ten years in any case and we wouldn't be bothered to buy it, but then my husband started in business you see soon after he came back and we eventually got the shop and, of course it's very convenient because we're only a stone's throw from the shop you see, so we stayed here
You say it was 
and eventually we bought it
And this was the first group of houses
This was the first of development of houses 
First of the houses 
first of the houses that the Corporation built 
Yeah there were , there were a hundred here actually, there's now a hundred and fourteen 
What year were they completed?
Er
Forty nine?
well this, no, fifty one, er this was the last house to be completed on this estate because it had been used as a paint store and we were the very last people 
Apart from those on the far side of the road which were built several years later on on another complex 
Oh yes later, yes that's true, yes 
Out of the original hundred houses this was the last one to be occupied and we saw this being built, erm right from the time that it was a plot of land and we knew it was ours 
Brick by brick, we knew it was ours 
er from, from the footings in other words so I was
from that, it was quite interesting really
And hundreds of people, architects, all this development here, this hundred houses were mainly architects or engineers from the Corporation
Who?
Who?
who lived in these house plus I should think about
Million workers
ten per cent of building workers and er about five per cent of British hired mechanic staff.
It was a mixed development?
It was a mixed development with very much the emphasis on Corporation staff at that time er and of course they had to house the, got house 
But they had to house you didn't they?
the staff somewhere and we, we came in here and of course most of the people eventually had families and er they moved out to bigger accommodation as their families grew up, you know, er, we were very pleased to get the house of course because we'd  we'd lived in this Nissan hut for er either one or two years but it did 
Don't know very difficult to tell the time now how er, how long these things were
Not er
but er, I know it was forty six that I er came back 
Came back 
because that was the year that I, I actually started the business because erm
That's right, mm
in er, we had a cutting somewhere Marie, oh I know when we became a limited company, er that's right and er we put in erm formally erm  er  take over the business 
Patent 
run by 
That's right
er since nineteen forty six or something I don't know the date exactly 
That's right, mm quite, mm 
and er that's how I remember it by except for of course the war ended in nineteen forty five but weren't 
But when we 
we weren't the first to come back or anything
You're interested in the furniture side of it?
Yes I am
Well when we came here of course we had certain furniture and we just sort of er, er and we, I don't know what other people did, we just erm furnished a room at a time until we got  
We furnished two rooms when we got in 
We furnished two rooms when we came in here 
that was the one bedroom and er and it was this room some what 
and er, we never have had any hire purchase arrangements 
Yeah 
but I rather gather large people would get everything you see 
Yes exactly 
but we didn't you see, we didn't, we just got things as we went on and of course in those days, it was, what was it called?
Erm tt furniture er
Furniture that what it were called
you know, erm, mm
What the manufacturer?
No, no the erm tt deary me
The hire purchase?
No, erm, that the in the war time the soldiers
Utility
Utility furniture, I couldn't think of the word
Did you have utility furniture?
No we didn't because I had bought various things, I like antiques so does my husband, I'd bought various things while he was away in this erm, the card table and er, I had a new place of stuff, er but since we've been, but we had odd chairs didn't we?
Er
Oh yeah
but all of which are gone and we've replaced them with these since many, you know, quite a few years ago, er we bought one utility suite from an engineer who was going to Rhodesia and that's in our second bedroom still  it's, well the bed is but the 
The bedroom suite?
The bedroom suite, yes, the bed's still there, but er, we changed the erm dressing table and the rest of it 
I think there's only , there's only the bed there left now
there's only the bed there left 
Oh yeah cos we've, we've erm, apart from the antiques we've, we've refurnished everything er at least once since we've had it
Just once, yes
and yes, er our bedroom of course is
Refurnished
completely refurnished, er
and the dining room's refurnished
You have a dining room?
 
yes you can have a look, it'll be interesting for you 
I would be, yes 
in seeing this house, because it's, well we think it's rather nice er, you know it's quite a 
It's got a good long garden with this as well 
It's got a long garden 
more than sixty feet long and erm over the last two or three years er I've made a patio at the bottom, right the whole width of the garden
Mm
and er eighteen feet wide so that you can get a dozen down there seated if necessary, you know, yeah
Really?
looking very pleasant 
Right I think so, I'll check it again in a minute just to make sure.
It's a complicated piece of apparatus
Well  the last time I came you told me
Well we got married in nineteen forty one and I lived first of all in Sussex where erm my mother was living because my husband went into the Air Force and he was erm away for five years, well we had a lot of bombing in the early part of the war in Sussex and my father eventually came here to Harlow thinking we were getting away from it and of course we came right into the V er what was it?
What was it called?
The V bomb, V bombers and the doodlebugs and er when he came home it was nineteen forty six I think or seven er, my fath er my mother had died and my father wanted to get away from the place we were in and we said oh well go ahead you know, we'll easily get somewhere and of course we didn't and they put us in a Nissan hut, which we made absolutely beautiful, we did all sorts of things to it and had a lovely garden all around it and the people from the Council use to come around and say to us oh well you don't need to be rehoused because you've made this so very nice you see, anyway I then started to work for the Corporation and then there was the possibility of course 
of me getting a house.
Could I ask you to go back and ask you to describe what the Nissan hut was like, what kind of a accommodation did you have in it?
What, well, we had a very large sitting dining room where we put er our dining room furniture at one end and as, the sitting room furniture at the other, it was very large actually, a Nissan hut doesn't look very big, but it is quite big  and we had one large bedroom where we got all our furniture in there and then there was er a kitchen, and there was an Elsan lavatory in the garden which er you had to go outside for that, and er, we bought a full length galvanized bath like an ordinary bath upstairs and there was a boiler in the kitchen so we used to light the fire of the boiler, fill the boiler with water from the tap, we had a, oh we had all sorts of er innovations that made life easy as could be in the circumstances, we had er hose pipe from the kitchen sink into the bathroom, we managed to get about three baths a week, cos it, it was a terrible fag, but we did, and then you just emptied the bath out and out in the drain outside you know.
So you had to pick it up and carry it outside?
Well we had to drag it and
Yes
till we got to near the den and do that and we spent er a year and a half there and all the time we were watching this house being built, because I was working at the Corporation and the number of people of the Corporation from the tea boy cadet down came up to see this, this and that, was nobody's business, mm, without, we enjoyed it, it was quite funny really it is 
Were there many Nissan huts in, in the same 
Yes there were , there were about ten I think, but they were all widely separated, we all had a lot of ground around us, so,s so you weren't on top of your next door neighbour, you didn't, you hardly see them, or hear them really, there was plenty of room.
And apart from the garden that you said that you made it lovely while you were there, what other things did you do to make it look like a home?
Well for instance a lot of people didn't even bother to erm make the kitchen floor into anything reasonable, but we did, we, we got some very good, very heavy
and put it down, it, on the kitchen floor of this place, and in the, our sitting room we had a carpet it was er a carpet of David's mother's actually, but it covered the entire sitting room and it looked rather nice you know, because it was a big room and we also had a carpet of sorts in the bedroom.
And did you buy new furniture when you 
Oh no , no I'd, I had a new case of furniture, I had some of this furniture there.
Antique furniture?
Antique furniture, yes, erm, because I'd bought that during the war in various antique places, you know, and erm, what did we buy, no I think my father gave us the bedroom furniture was, which was at the
at the time and we took that with us, which was an old fashioned, a really old Victorian suite which we got rid of when we moved into this house.
So you didn't buy any utility furniture?
So we didn't buy very, little utility furniture, the only utility furniture we've got is, it used to be a bedroom suite up in that second bedroom, we've still got the bed of that, that was utility, but had we been in the market we would of bought utility because it was very good, some of it was really good if you looked around and erm, you know, choose your furniture, it was very good 
Could you tell me a bit more about that, because I don't know anything at all about utility furniture 
About utility furniture , well you know the G Plans that now that there is, well this utility furniture to my mind if you choose really good makes of your utility furniture it was rather, after the style I would say G Plan, that was I've always imagined it were, it was good quality of, of a price that people could afford, if you got the right erm, type of stuff.
So there was a difference in quality between one make 
I would think so, yes I think, I would think so because the bedroom suite, the bed upstairs er of that er suite is quite a good quality bed, you know, it's only a spring mattress of course it's not a, it's not a box thing like we'd have today, I mean, what we have in our other room, I've always intended to change it, but never got round to it, but it er just had a spring mattress, but it was good quality of its time
Mm
er, and I would think, well like any furniture now wherever you go you can buy the most atrocious furniture can't you?
And pay terrific amount of money for it
Mm
and you can buy something, well which would appeal to me, anyway, er for not very much more if you look around.
I rather like a lot of the G Plan stuff I like very much.
But there wasn't very much choice in the styles was there?
Oh no, no there was, erm  it was very utilitarian, very er, were I should think plan would use the I, I don't think er, I can't remember a great deal about utility furniture apart from the fact that we have just this one bedroom suite, but remembering back to the, er we had the bed and the chest, the chest was very plain and very nice, very nice
And you don't still have it?
I don't still have it, no, no it had got knocked about a bit, you know, being moved hither and thither and the other people have had it a bit as well as us, because we bought it from the people who lived next door when they left you see, cos when we started in here, we didn't have any carpets on these floors or under here it's brown Marley tiling  and I can still show you that
Oh yes
brown tiles and it was brown tiles all in that room and of course we couldn't, we had started a business and all the money had gone into the business and we couldn't afford to, to start carpeting, it was impossible, so, but that room really looked superb I think, I had huge rugs, you know, one in front of the fireplace and another one this end and the other end in colour, in colours, and there really, it really looked nice and the floor was polished up to the nines, you know, er right through here all polished all the same colour
And you moved into the house in nineteen fifty
Nineteen fifty one, we moved in, er and, I've had, you're not the first person to come all round here, this house, they used, they used to come round in shows from the Corporation all visitors used to come, they used to say, right Jean can we bring them round  we've had people from Germany  and everywhere and being in the architect's department I fell for all this  you know I had  
This is all very much in the early days 
Yes, right in the early days.
So you worked with the Corporation
From nineteen forty eight
until nineteen fifty two?
Yes, and during that time they used to have a lot of people visiting from overseas
And Chipping Field was rather like a, like a sort of prototype for Harlow New Town.
Well it was the first hundred houses that were built in the New Town and it housed a lot of building trade workers, a lot of engineers and a lot of archi well a lot, a few architects and a few engineers and the rest were building trade workers or of some sort or another, and a few British Hydro
Research Association been put down on this
So mostly people involved with
Most the people who were involved with getting the town together, from the beginning
Mm.
you know, right from the beginning.
And how did you feel about moving from the Nissan hut into a brand new house?
Oh absolutely marvellous we watched the house go up brick by brick, you know, we, we used to come down here and think oh my goodness won't it be marvellous to be able to run some water and have a bath in the  normal way you know  cos we don't, we'd both always had electricity and baths and everything else until this happened and erm, we er, oh it was wonderful, really wonderful  absolutely marvellous
And how did you feel about the New Town being born?
Oh well we had no feelings about it because I really wasn't an Old Harlow person, nor was my husband and all that we could think about it was that it would be very good for the area, it would erm, bring work and employment and everything like that, but of course Old Harlow people were very, you know, a lot of them were very against it and yet, in the end, the Harlow High Street shops was, made a fortune in those first few years, you know, when there was nothing else and the, the Old Harlow High Street wasn't of course paved over in those days, anything like that and it, it was a narrow, narrow high street, it was almost like taking your life in your hands walking down there because there were crowds of people obviously with all this influx of community and they er  the main Chelmsford road used to come up through there, so it was a, a hell, sort of a traffic hazard really.
And how did you feel about the sudden influx of a lot of people and?
Well, I didn't mind it was quite interesting, for one thing erm  we were sort of off the beaten track here and although we're in the town you might say, we're out of it, we're in the country aren't we?
You see 
But don't you think that gen that Harlow generally has that feeling?
Well it does here, I don't know er, I wouldn't say in some of the parts of Harlow I would get that feeling, but then I am really a country person at heart and I don't like towns anyway, so I'm not really the best person to ask, no.
Could we go back and perhaps you tell me, erm what it felt like, for example cooking a meal or doing the washing in a Nissan hut and the difference of when you came in to to Chipping Field 
Well the difference was like moving from purgatory into heaven really, because er  in the Nissan hut I had one tap of cold water, that's all, every bit of water had to be heated on a gas stove, and every bit of water for a bath had to be heated in an old fashioned er boiler in which you lit the fire under  and of course when you came here we had a ni an electric cooker, er straight away 
Was it a new one?
Yes I had a brand new electric cooker, that was one of our buys, I didn't have a washing machine when we got here, but I had a wash boiler, an ordinary wash boiler.
Did you have a refrigerator?
Yes I did have a refriger I had, we bought a refrigerator and er a cooker and it sat in that recess there, that was our big buy when we first came, er we had a bedroom suite when we came here and we had sufficient furniture to, to erm furnish the sitting room and we had er a suite of furniture in here erm
Was it this one?
No, an oak table and an oak sideboard and that was all and just four chairs or six chairs I think it was, yes, er and it was erm that furniture was a utility, er I'd forgotten about that, it's taken me back now, that was a utility dining room suite of really first class quality, it was a tallish sideboard with two doors with big bow legs and a square table, erm, but it was solid oak really good
 
Can you remember the make?
Ooh no I can't, I can remember where we bought it, we bought it in Hillsham and we paid about two hundred pounds for it, I know, erm, what was I saying?
Sorry I interrupted you.
Er, I can't remember what I said, oh  no it's gone
Oh
It was a joy to be able to go and have a bath every night  you know  to just run the water and find it came out hot, it was absolutely marvellous 
How was the water heated, by a boiler?
No, by an immersion heater, yeah
Electric?
Electric immersion heater, er, ah, oh of course we had an Ideal boiler under there and it, that's what heated this kitchen actually an Ideal boiler and it heated the water in the winter and also heated the, and in the summer we let that out and had an immersion heater, well being in the electrical trade we had an immersion heater all the time and if we wanted to top up from the boiler we used to just put the immersion heater on for a erm week or so and get hot water and then let it go off in the winter time, you know, but er  we haven't made a great deal of alteration to this place really, we've put a new front door on fairly recently, that was one of the things that er was very ugly, they, the back of the front of the doors to look at, ooh they were ugly doors
Where they metal
Er
frame?
erm
Were they glazed?
They were glazed with ribbed glass, you could see quite a lot of them on Chipping Field, still, er and nearly everyone who's bought their houses have altered the doors, but a lot of people have put these wooden doors in you know
Yes
filled in and that, and they look completely out of er they don't look part of the house to me
Yes
I don't know whether it's er me or whether it's er
Talking about front doors I've noticed that a lot of the houses have got two doors on the front side
Yes 
one which is the front door and
that's the front door and that's the back door, through there
Yes, do you have one as well?
Yes
Yes, how did you feel about that when you first came to live here?
Er, well having, no did, didn't worry me at all 
Because a lot of people of, were very disturbed about having two doors on the, on the front, they felt that one should be on the back by the side 
By the side you can't with a terrace, can you really, yeah, I think any terrace, surely would have two doors on the front, wouldn't it?
If they have two doors it's not 
If they have two doors, yes
Could, the furniture that's right er was there 
was one 
was there any furniture that you could buy which wasn't rationed?
Well yes you could go to antique shops and buy that sort of furniture 
Yes , but you couldn't buy all new?
secondhand no, no, no new furniture 
No new furniture?
no, it was rationed, and er, talking about erm people's taste having changed, I think the media has a great deal to do with that because when you look at things on television you can see how  people
Yes
do things, can't you?
Mm
You can see furniture, you can see old houses, Arthur Neagus going round all these old houses, you can see a lot of things now, that the normal public never would see in the, the ordinary man in the street probably never saw them at one time, but I think this must of made a difference to people.
What do you think influenced you, I mean if you went to choose a chair did you sit on it to see if it was comfortable or were you more interested in what it looked like?
Oh no I think I'd want it to be comfortable, but I'd also want it to look well what I considered to be nice.
Do you think that the sizes of the rooms that people considered the sizes of the rooms when they choose furniture?
I don't know
It's difficult
I don't know about that, it's difficult
Mm
very difficult
bottom cupboards and the rest of it, therefore I wanted that and I wanted this
Would you call this a dresser?
No it's a desk actually 
Because it's 
because it's got a desk, it's desk and er, we keep it, er this comes down as a desk, you can write on there 
Yes 
and erm the rest is just cupboards for glasses and cutlery and my hu husband's inevitable lots and lots of papers that he has everywhere 
Mm, do you think that it's important to have a sideboard as a piece of furniture, because a dining room isn't a dining room without a sideboard or?
No, no, that wouldn't worry me, I just, I said when we got rid of our other sideboard let's do without one and then I looked round and thought well what the dickens am I going to do with all this stuff that we've got and I just found that we couldn't do without it.
Mm, so
We had to take the door off there, there used to be a door on there, but to get this long sideboard in we had to take the door off
Really?
otherwise the door took up so much room, you see.
A lot of things that I'd still do here if, if I could whip up some enthusiasm  if my husband would, I can't  , he was a bricklayer, sub contractor and they have knocked this kitchen out about three times since they've been there, and the last, this last effort, I think they've put imitation beams in, I haven't seen it, but we think they have and er, oh it's, you wouldn't know it's the same house at all, you wouldn't know it
Mm
He was and because he was getting on in years and er didn't get out as much as usual, my husband said we'd get a television for him and we had a black and white television
Would you remember what year that was?
Oh, dear he's been dead, ten  it must of been the ten, this is eighty two, seventy two, about sixty five I should think about sixty five 
So it was long, long after most people in Harlow
A long, long after most people had televisions here
Especially in Harlow?
in Har oh everybody had television before us
Mm, mm
the same way is, now is everybody is rushing out buying videos
Yes
how on earth they can afford it I just don't know  it's ridiculous 
And when you came to find a place to put the television in your living room
Yes
or do you call this living room?
We call this the sitting room
The sitting room 
Yes , yes
did you have difficulty finding where to place it?
Er, well no, it's always been in the place it's in now
Next to the fireplace
next to the fire place, er a lot of people have put it up in this corner and, but 
Near the window
near the window, but we decided that that's where we wanted it, it suited us and that's where we put it.
It never has moved from there because our two chairs and it's normally only two of us watching it, cos if we've got visitors we never have it on, you know, er they just face that way and it's convenient and that's where we put it.
Do you feel that it competes with the fireplace as a focal point in the room?
No, no
So it's a double focal point
Yes, yes, it doesn't compete with the fireplace, we have a, a, er mock fire in there you know, normally in the winter that, that's on and it looks, it's very realistic, it almost looks as if it is a fire glowing all the time cos there's a rotary spinner in it and it flickers, er, and er the room is very warm because it's central heated anyway and, no I wouldn't say, it never bothers me the television, I don't suppose that er, if I were left on my own I'd hardly have it left on  you know  I think men watch television more than women.
And do you think that the, the room wouldn't be the same without the fireplace, without the glowing red, even though it's very warm with the central heating, you still need 
Oh yes I think , I think you need a focal point, I think, I'd find it rather difficult without a fireplace at all.
So really it, the, the fireplace is more of a focal point than would the 
I would say 
television?
Oh yes, yes I would say that yes, and of course that fireplace is the original fireplace, and it's very nice isn't it don't you think?
It's very nice
Mm lovely
and the erm, when you moved in obviously you had to use it
Oh yes we had coal fires
Yes
yes
What kind of coal, fuel did you use?
Well we used erm, a smokeless fuel of which we found very good, I forget what it was, er
Was it rationed?
It was like Coalite, er when we first came here, oh yes it was, yes, but we have electric fires of course as well to, what we did because we were both out working all the time, we had electric fires and I think my husband, husband had them allied to a timeswitch and they came on before we came in, an hour or so, before we came in this room and in that room
That was a modern, that was an innovation 
Yes, yes, that was an innovation
Yes
I mean we did a lot of things that other people probably didn't do, I always remember next door to us at one time the curate of the St Mary's church, er, who is er, he is now Bishop of  mm, gosh, he's a up in Nottingham way, Bishop of something or other, we met him at a, at a do not so very long ago and he's just the same, he's marvellous and he was the curate and they were as poor as church mice and er in relation to them we were really well off you know, and er they had hardly any fires or anything and we gave them an electric fire to heat their place up and er  when we met him, it was last February at a, a do of one of the research engineers from where I was work working the last job I had and er, he said I've still got the electric fire 
And that would of been what in the fifties?
That would of been in the fifties 
Yes, yeah 
early fifties
Yes
fifty fiveish
Yes
yes, certainly is.
