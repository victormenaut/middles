Brian has agreed to join us as Edinburgh Theatre Manager and David  hopefully will be
but the tape, erm  for Brian's benefit is, is the first feature film that's been  made available on video with an audio description built into it
Mhm
so it is erm something of a step forward, erm  we've had material in the past which you may have seen which was recorded from the telly, a couple of years ago in nineteen ninety
Mhm
erm what was that woman called from America?
Can't remember but people from Boston in, in 
Margaret 
No Lori
Oh yeah
from the Description Video Services in Boston, there's a lot of described telly in America
Mhm
er and we obviously are trying to push S T V and B B C into this as well, but you know and film, we're talking to film people as well erm, but this is the first er feature film that's been done so Marcus  who normally
from R N I B in London, I think it's my opposite number, the answer
erm is quite excited about it.
So
You want to see it
press the button 
you see past me?
Yes I can, thanks
no you can't 
What it is, it's a formula extract which is repeated twice, once with the soundtrack, well once without, once as, as a sort of regular broadcast
Mhm
then with the description on it
With and without
With and without, yes as they say
Before and after
Before and after 
So what happens in the finished article?
Well what it is, it's going to be available as a video cassette with the soundtrack
Mhm
in it
Mhm
as a whole film, which I'm gonna want a copy 
It's going on sale in September I think
it's going on sale in a couple of weeks
Eighteenth of September, yes
erm
I put it on, I've suggested people put it on the Christmas list, I think it would be a good Christmas present 
First video movie on the description, yes released Hear My Song, twenty six pounds
No three for twenty six 
Three for twenty six pounds, and ten pounds is a hell of a subsidized price 
ten pounds or three for twenty six
Mm
at the end of September
Mm
What do you think about it?
I like it
Right  is that actually running Jane?
Oh well no, it doesn't seem to be.
It is running but it's not showing us anything
which is interesting
 

thing's plugged in
Is that channel nine on the telly?
Channel nine on the telly, mhm, there's the right one  that's all in the right places  don't know  We're not going to see it after all
It doesn't look like it
strange isn't it?
There must be nothing on it.
Try spinning it forward a bit, might be
 

It's a very short thing really isn't it?
Mm 
Ah
No, that's not it
No it's not, it's definitely channel nine that's the video channel
Ah
That's not it either
It isn't anything 
Mm
It's not tuning at anything, oh 
Oh well, we'll, we'll tell you about it instead 
Sorry about that 
Miracles of technology
Erm, it's 
I'll give you a selection of songs from it
Erm, is it a new film?
No it must be a year old or something
Right 
Yes , it's
it's comparatively new
Right, because I knew nothing about it, yeah, so
it seems to have been quite a reasonable picture, you know, it's quite well
as a film
Mhm
As you probably know it's presently showing at the cinema, and is a story of an Irish tenor Joseph Locke
You must've got an extra sheet than me because one of the things I was moaning about this morning erm, maybe you've got a different 
Do you want a copy of this?
maybe you've got a different letter than the one I've got
Maybe you have a
that is the letter 
because 
and that is  what is audio description on video, audio description and Hear My Song
Oh it's that song, yes, right, I remember that one coming on
other uses of audio description
Yeah
television, cinema, theatre
Yes I've got the information sheets
You've got that
I got a different letter from this
Right
I've got a letter from 
cos that's the one 
Marcus  rather than, from than this
And you've got all these
Yeah
things, yeah?
Yeah
Roster and things
Yeah.
So I'm not quite sure what the long term connection with er talk
is
Right
and I'm not entirely sure, Marcus did phone me and say, at one point, when he was making up the mailing list, he's had three hundred copies of that made of the extract and he was kind of you know, sniffing around for who to send them to
Right
erm, so you, that's when he said he would send one to me, but he's obviously sent them to, and Cath's, Cath's had one
Has Cath had one?
Maybe she'd pass it on to me
Erm, erm
I would like to think
so there's one at, there is one at and there is also one erm 
Yes because it would of come to from
that's where mine came from
But I'm not sure, I, Doug  has got one, Doug  is my chairman, chairman of the Arts Committee erm
Mhm
I'm not quite sure why he's got one apart from, unless Marcus just decided to send one to him, but he's sent it to home, so I'm not quite sure what Marcus is mailing
It's voluntary organization so your
yeah
Mhm it could be that
but it would've normally come to us here you see at
yes
anyway Duncan
Anyway
Duncan phoned me on Friday about something else and said oh have we had this tape, so I said yes, and he said have you seen it and I said no not yet, and he said, erm but he thought it was quite good  erm
It's Cathy aye just bring
Alright, hello Cath
Hi there
Sorry I've been to disability Scotland
Oh right
There's a nice swivel chair there
Oh it's smashing
feel particularly voluble 
No important
Important
that was lovely I haven't seen
Have you not?
Do you want to take your coat off?
Now, can I introduce you to, I don't think you two have met.
We've, we've met before at
yes
you have met?
Yeah
You have
Do you want to take your coat off then?
Yes I'm fine, I'll just leave it here, that's right.
You sure it's alright there, do you want some coffee?
Oh that would be wonderful if it's not gonna cause, oh yes that's
And I should
Do you get a copy of
yeah
And I should explain, the microphone in the middle of the table and the man over here with the tape recorder is tape recording this meeting
Oh no  no
So everybody in the world knows you were late
 

so I wasn't really late, it was in the wrong place.
So the purpose of the, of the tape recorder is
Yes
is to do with the
Milk and sugar Cath?
development of dictionaries and the use, the use of English so we have been assured in, that, that, anything we say will be divorced from
apparently all proper names and phone numbers will be bleeped out
That's okay, no problem at all 
so we're to ignore it .
What we were just saying Cath was, we was just trying to look at the, the tape that's just come from Marcus, the erm the film and
Have you seen it?
It won't 
We haven't we were just gonna look at it but Jane has a technical knock, not speaking to each other 
It won't show, no
It's awful
Is it?
And now, well I said
what I was just gonna say was that Doug, Doug  had phoned me on Friday and said had I seen it and I said no and he said it's quite good he said
it's four minutes without the description, then four minutes with it and, and I thought that doesn't concur with what Cath  said to me on Thursday afternoon 
The technology 
that's not fair, the technology is good and, and very obviously gets over what it's supposed to get over, that's terrific, but wait till you see this subject matter 
But the actual 
but the actual extract as, as Cath said to me the other day, you know she felt sure and I said to her you know in a full length film they could've actually chosen a better moment
Aha
because
and we were talking mainly, an elderly, a female elderly client group, let's be honest you know, in terms of blind you know, and just wait till you see it, it's lovely
Erm and I think it's to a couple of colleagues 
No it's not working I think it's you know 
this morning when, where we all watched it for the first time together and as, as Richard  said you know, I'm, I'm squeamish about going to the dentist, so, and it cos er, it's basically there's a scene in the bar where they're pulling this guy's tooth out
which is, is not sort of, you know
Richard you know
Could of been a cataract operation, should of been
Could of been, yes
grateful for it.
So you know that, that as you know Richard said you know good idea, could make quite a few people, so I think Marcus, if, if Marcus chose that moment he, he really
Chose the wrong moment
could of chose a better one, erm having said that the second part there's two parts, there's this scene in the pub and then there's this er scene on the cliff top and the second scene one's a bit better
Right
Oh right
The thing, two things that struck me about it, one of which is that we were not talking about a separate soundtrack, the actual existing soundtrack of the film is merged with the audio description
Right
is what we've talked about in films and T V is erm having erm  I suppose the integrity if that's the right word of the existing film or programme standing alone and then on separate soundtrack like in the theatre
Mm
you know, there's a description which you can choose to listen to or not
Mhm
with this film it will be, you know, compulsory, you won't be able to make that choice, erm and the other one, the other thing that struck me just from one of the particular extracts of, of people standing on top of this cliff, erm is, is the way that the importance of, in something like a film where it's, you know, it's done for good, you know the importance of having an actual creative writer
Yes
doing the writing to get over in the description cos they talk about the swirling sea
Mhm
there's one or two moments like that, which is possibly a different, you know, if, if, you cou cou you know, putting it on, on to tape
Mhm
for life, you know,
Mhm
it's that kind of thing, rather than I suppose to the theatre way, you know, you, you react much more spontaneously, so I thought that was an interesting thing that thing 
I just thought 
jumped off
the page, do.
I thought it was interesting as well that the stuff I got from the I and R V with it, was a lot about audio description and the tape and how much it cost and how wonderful this was and it was the first time it had ever been done, but there was nothing, as is always the case, there was nothing actually about what the film was about, it was full of sort of, this is the first time it's done, but nothing about sort of this is the film about, about this, this is what the story's about, you know.
It's, it is very akin to that one sort of you know, well here's the audio description you better like it.
I mean I suppose it is the first time, it's the only film of its type, you, you know what I'm getting at, it's exactly the same thing we, we tried very hard to avoid in the access guide, actually being able to say what instead of just saying you know
Mhm
the Lyceum Theatre is fully wheelchair accessible, we actually describe what the theatre, what kind of plays it shows 
Yes 
erm, you know why it's different from the Travellers which is round the corner
Mhm
you know, erm what the difference in the work that, that, that they do.
I don't, I'm not quite sure of erm that's, I think that's a different thing.
Sometimes say people say to me can you give us
of the play, what's it about, cos we don't know what it's, you know about, before we come, which is fair enough, erm, that's very often sighted people don't know
Mm 
Mm 
Mm quite
so if blind people are trying to be on the same level terms with sighted people, then, you know, why should they get an
Mhm
I'm, I'm not quite sure, I mean I'd give an
if there's one available
Mhm
for instance there's a nice one for
Mhm
so I gave that and there was nothing, this year the citizens have nothing at their
we put people off going, so I'm not saying anything about it, not erm, I don't, I mean, I don't, I could say what the story of Major Barbara is, but then it's not in any of the printed pamphlets for sighted people, therefore, should I, what should I do Cathy I don't know 
No I, I don't I really don't, I think it, in it with
yes
it's the quality of access
Exactly
it's not some sort of different, erm, sort of, it shouldn't be a different scenario for 
Well that's what I feel, yes.
and er, very often if you knew  somewhat, you know, obviously modern it would, it would spoil it because you're there 
You would, that's right 
to see what it's like really and to feel what it's like and to, no I don't think we should do.
Some things are very difficult to actually work out what the
as well 
you can 
I mean
You're right
take Marilyn last year, we didn't know what was gonna happen until it happened
and then it happened different every night as well 
I suppose if there's something in the programme then they should
I think that's what I'm talking about really actually is that, I mean if you're, if you're selling a film like you know if, if 
It's a marketing line 
it is a marketing line 
Yes, it is a marketing line, right 
as saying, you know, this is a story about this and that and you look at that 
But then I would read it, so if I was in the theatre I would read that so I would know that
Yeah
before the play started 
Mhm 
so blind people should be in the same position there shouldn't they?
Should, yeah, yeah 
Yes 
So I mean if there is, if there are two lines saying this is the story of
That's right, yes
Yes
That's
but then we do that at the start
anyway
Yes you do that
but it's beforehand eh, for instance they have little flowers that tells the story of what's, what the plays about and I think it's fair enough to read that, because a sighted person would go in and pick it up 
Would be reading it 
and say what is this?
That's an interesting actually side chart, I mean this is completely off the agenda and things, but erm, I just had some information up from er, from RADA and er
That's the dates for everything, I see, sorry
One of the things the group in Wolverhampton I think at the Theatre Royal there is, is doing both audio descriptions by sign language I think and one of the things they've, they, they do is meet in the bar
Mm
like half an hour before the show
Mm
and someone, I don't know whether it's the director, or someone actually says this play is, is the half hour, quarter of an hour, chat say, this is what the play's about
Mhm
you know and the precis you know and I thought that was interesting that they did that, because it's not something we'd thought of really doing, ever
No, no
erm programme notes yes, but not the actual sort of
this is the story of two people and this happens and that happens and that also comes in
Yes
Mm
so I was, I was interested to see that, I mean that
No I didn't, I think that was right
I wouldn't of thought that were right, and all
Mm, the director always, I mean
After show talks yes, maybe to be able to say well what do you think of that and  
Oh yes that's terrific, in fact it would be fun, aha
but er, no
but no I don't think
That's assuming that blind people wouldn't understand what they're hearing on the stage
I think, well you see, this is the other thing, yes 
that's right 
that's right, yes you have to tell them what to look out for kind of thing 
There's enough examples of that and you read, the most peculiar thing I, I think I was telling, I don't know if I was telling Iris I have a notion I had, had it in my mind to tell you and you turned up with this blind girl to do this M C
with the video team
Mhm
the team you know are very, very important people
they announce in the room we are from video such and such, you know and just looked at me, this black man explained everything to everybody else and then the guy went over and sat down and explained it all again just blind
and m I thought he was gonna start saying something different
Yeah
but I realize the same thing, I said erm,
She can hear
she, she actually has heard all this before
Yeah
and he said oh yes of course, you know, this
you don't, you think we've all moved on in things that all 
Yeah 
were all so much
so it's bad enough if they gather them in the gathering them in the barrel like, the barrel bit, but not the sort of 
Yeah 
gathering you get to explain what's going to happen, first of all you done  
And does she take sugar?
Yes 
Oh  would you like some more?
All I was gonna say that, that if that was you
Oh well if there is
if that was it on the agenda that I miss because of being so early bit in the wrong place
what I wanted to do is say is what about the publicity can we try and make the very best of this
Mhm, mhm
erm you know, because I want to do something more clear that's gonna fit in with everybody else
Yeah
it's an ideal opportunity
Yes I mean, erm
I can't do anything about it erm  yet because we've only just got it, I mean what, what you thinking of?
There's a bar on it until the eighteenth of September isn't there?
Oh is there?
Is there?
Yes 
That's when they're, that's when they're launching the full 
because I mentioned it in Playback because I thought er, trouble is within a
and it's just a take on, so I watched what I said, but erm, we mentioned it, we, we didn't see very much about it we just said it's coming up we'll have, we'll let you in for a full details next month so 
 
Mm
the other thing we might do is erm  is a  at the film council and see if he can help us with, I mean it is a film after all whether he's got er particular contacts
Mm
anything council with media or anything
Mhm
erm
yes that would be
to say you know, this is, you know, this is arrived as it were, and the tape with full things coming in, in the middle of the month and, what, what kind of thing did you have anything in mind?
No, I, really just to see what, what everyone else was doing, I mean I was thinking of is a little 
of which she sort of goes into every door, every door in Strathclyde, what a horrible thought, but in fact you know I thought maybe try and do something there, although I don't always get on greatly well with, with the press and publicity people and the women in press and publicity are, are sort of start phrasing
once, once the
if she says it to me one more time I
No but, I will  
 
but I mean you know, if
you put that piece of dried heather and you light it
Light it, yes it does 
yes it does 
See that it does, yeah 
I think you know, if it's not child abuse or something you know
Aha
you know, straight to the heart erm, you know fifteen million children abandoned in Glasgow Green there, you know, she's really terribly taken with mind 
Not interested 
I think the answer to that is, I don't think you're in the right job
really is, erm quite annoying
 
er, yes 
fire fighting 
but worth trying that, that would certainly help, but I just wondered even if you know sort of local press, I mean presumably they are in their league for doing this
Well what, what I suppose we should do is find out what R N I B is doing first, that's what we should find 
Yes that would be good, aha 
and then we can maybe then think about it, okay well I'll, I'll
You come back to us then and
Well yeah I mean one by one, maybe if we can hit the Herald and erm The Times and
The Times is always good for replying things 
and the News and the Scotsman
Aha
and erm and erm, our friend at erm Radio 
The Daily Record 
Radio Clyde as well 
Mhm
I'm sure the local press will be interested too if you can involve them that would be a great help 
I would be very grateful 
as there will need to be more campaigning before we see the expansionable description in the theatre  and that could be 
Presumably R and R B would of contacted the big papers but, obviously not the small local ones
to help spread the news, I enclose the material
Mm, ah I mean if it was the question I mean I've got that material we've got it, I mean if it was question of sending out, I mean I could do that.
Well I'll check with R and R B's press office first just to check before we sort of do things, but I mean it'll be worth, would, would it be worth approaching erm Reporting Scotland and Scotland to
I think so
and, and Good Morning Scotland yeah all these kind of
Mhm
I would definitely think so
and the, the free papers I mean that's the one that goes through all the doors
Yes that's the one, that's right, mhm.
You know everybody gets it then.
Erm  right  what's the name of that nice man that Good Morning Scotland who Neil 
Neil 
is he still there?
I think so, yes
Oh, cos he did a couple of nice bits for us in the past
Mhm
for I was always keeping up my sleeve for sort of things we might do as opposed to R and M U have done
Mhm
Yeah
this is, that's a sort of reference to sort of 
Yes
get into sort of the voluntary organization
Enter the cut throat staff you know
a wrap through R and R B's not a hit
No
erm, right okay, well I'll look into that, but I think that serves a good point, right moving back to the agenda, erm, note of meeting fifth of August, erm, anything for those of you who were there, that Cath had to run away, that was one of your crises you were having
Oh god
that's right because you came back again
Right at the end 
It was still 
it was still, erm quite good that was worth it that day 
Was it oh good
because that location still on the go
Is it?
Oh good
that in, yes
Mm
lovely location.
Erm, we're, we're using the same agenda which is why conf confusion about venue on the front cos I said to my secretary 
 
she said what, what agenda do you want, so I said just the same and so she put the same venue, we tend to alter at the meeting she said
yeah
Yes I think it says it's Edinburgh in the front and Glasgow on the back or the other way round
Mm
That's why I'm late
Yes, yes
She was still in Glasgow, yeah
Scotland, I didn't know you were having it here
Well we felt like a change
Yes we felt like a change  why not, come to my lovely office 
 
it's lovely isn't it, you can't have it, falls apart when it's moved
So, it's the same agenda, so if everybody's okay with that note, I mean most things I think come up
Mhm
I should say that I, I came away from the last meeting with an enormous list of things to do, and I haven't managed to do them all, but they'll emerge as we go through, erm, developments Perth, Perth if inter interrupt me
Perth haven't 
Perth happened, it has it's pilot, on, on August the twelfth which Iris supervised
Mhm
mm, you seemed to of, I mean you were a bit disappointed there were less, not so many visually impaired people were there, but they, they were sort of casting the net with council  
No I wasn't so much disappointed as that I was disappointed that there was only five would be sponsors and that it was we had to give out 
Oh right 
about sixty headsets and I thought well who are these people we're getting, I think a lot of them were social workers, so that's fair enough
Mm
but erm
I mean certainly the Perth people seem well pleased and
Mm
somewhere I think I managed to remember to bring erm, their erm, their minutes from the meeting I didn't go to last week, but you did
erm, erm, no I haven't got them, erm, and they've agreed to go ahead in conjunction with 
I mean everything is kind of steaming up
It is going that is
erm
the monies
Well they're, they are still waiting for, for confirmation on money, but they've got quite a lot in the kitty already
Mm
because the, the society up in Perth, the Perth belong to a society and had this gigantic legacy and they'd agreed to spend it
a miniature amount of it on audio description, so from that point of view there they, was sort of fairly well down the line with the money anyway they, they had 
 
still giving money into it
erm, they were approaching the District Council weren't they?
Yes
The Common Good Fund and they, they had you know all I mean you know they had all feelers out for all, all the things, so there are a couple of dates which came up in the last meeting erm for further pilots and then the intention is to just go ahead from
Well they, they said at that meeting they'd hoped to have their system for the next one which is the seventeenth October
Oh right
Mm
because I didn't know whether I was going to have to bring ours up or not because I  
That's right, yeah because obviously the radio system was
Yes
used on, on, on the twelfth of August, erm
So they're going to have their er infra red 
so they hoped to have the infra red in by then, yeah 
They hope to have it by then 
Yeah, I mean what was nice in, in a way was that er I couldn't go to the last meeting I wasn't well, I had a cold er, what was nice in a way was that David  who's the general manager and the general manager from Pitlochry had come in, I mean in a way it was a classic case 
It was good 
of having sort of help set something off and then tiptoe away which has been one of my functions, that, that, that it can happen
Yes
Yes
It sounds good
and I felt quite happy especially with a bow tie on, you know, it had been, it had gone you know and in a way we sort of could almost sort of 
Can let go of it 
let go of it
Mhm
now, so it's, I was well pleased with that
In saying that go over, erm obviously I'm all for that, but in terms of sort of holding on to what they're doing I just had written down to mention that you know, we didn't have some sort of mechanism to, to share you know
Yes
either up to information on what's happening all this, you know and I'll I know we'll come on to 
Yes absolutely 
that point later
Mhm
but we must sort of all pull in together as a situation in Scotland now that which really concerns me and I'd
away because it's wonderful to have another theatre, but, erm it's just a bit maybe trying to draw up some method to do that.
Is there sort of a team leader of volunteers emerged up there?
Or is that, is that still theatre that's doing that?
Not yet I think at the moment they're organizing it, yes
Yeah, or is it the Society for the Blind or is it sort of between the two?
No it's the theatre 
It's the theatre is it?
I think Diane's organizing it all
right
Good, that's good it's a theatre  
Very good it's a theatre 
She can keep doing it 
Mm
erm
No
it all depends whether they want to do it or not
Yes
sometimes it's easier if you find to pass it on to someone else
Oh yes, I mean I just wouldn't of got anywhere with it 
Oh aye, no, no 
but I'm hoping to pass Glasgow onto someone else 
It's quite interesting that it's the theatre that's doing it, I was on a course last week in Sussex, a management course and there was Bradford theatre companies were there erm, from all the different theatres and they, they organize it and they organize the volunteers
Oh really?
That is the, that is the 
they do the training now 
How, do they do that through a friends group or?
Yes, friends of the theatre
Right
it's quite interesting that they do it
Yes
Well it's a perfect opportunity for friends to 
That's difficult in the setting up stages 
Mm
you know, it's whoever takes it on really
I think that's we all, we all visualize it 
Ours is always 
I mean the closer it is to the theatre the better
Yeah
the contacts are and everything and I think that's much better if it can be got down to that eventually
And you're getting people who are interested in the theatre
Mhm
Yeah
Oh, right from the beginning when we talk to citizens about using their friends of the theatre I nearly fell about you know
And yet I have three, I have three good friends of the theatre involved 
Do you, ah, mm now
one of them's the chairman  
Yes, yes 
We have friends of the Lyceum involved
There is historically, I mean it maybe the same at the
as it is at the Lyceum that there is kind of historically a certain amount of, not exactly friction, but I mean something that has 
That is 
sort of got kind of an odd relationship between the friends 
Yes 
and the management literally
Mm
I suppose they see themselves as 
I suspect it's the same in the 
Yeah 
The sort of suffering chart
Yeah
Aye, aye
But I think it's an ideal thing cos people who remember the friends are always interested in the theatre
Yes
and that's such a good start
And be able to pass on the enthusiasm 
Yes, Mhm , yeah
And we also, I mean it was also felt that you know the friends mechanism of the newsletters and get together 
Mhm 
yes 
you know
Mhm
is a way of getting
erm
Mhm, spread the word
I don't know maybe it may just be come down to sort of the individual theatres I suppose
Mhm
that's the thing 
 
It was quite interesting that all of the theatres and all the theatre staff who were there knew all about audio description
Yeah
Really?
because I spoke to them all about it
Yes, mhm
and it was happening in all of their theatres
Mm
it's just good
it's interesting isn't it?
that's good , mhm
Yeah
Mhm
so, mm  so anyway it's apparently it's kind a way in
one of the things that Dough  who was there, er with Iris on, on, on the twelfth er spotted was that one of his ex students who now works in educational technology or something equally grand in the Northern College in Dundee is one of the volunteers who have come forward
Oh
Mm
and with her kind of background in, in writing up training package, packages and things
Mm
That's good
he has, he's not asked her, he's nobbled her to actually get involved in helping with the compilation of the training package 
Training package, mm 
once she's sort of you know 
 
I mean obviously once she's been through the learning process herself, so Doug came away feeling quite pleased that he'd made that contact and he also sort of made one or two, he, he had one or two wise observations I think about the evening, he made one or two new contacts himself and the suggestion and things, he spoke very well about it, at our committee on our last meeting last week
Oh good
so eliminate er, it raves about how successful
Good
the system is.
So that was 
 
the sort of a contact for training now.
Good, manage to get the equipment back that the sighted people ran off with?
No, erm, well it's, it's not just, they didn't have, it wasn't too much, there's one ear piece which has come off, but I discovered at, my last, I sent myself last week at the assembly hall to how that could happen
Ah
because it happened to me, you know the little soft bit?
Yes
Oh right
I was wearing I had the, the stethoscope behind my neck and I took it off for something, I was holding it up to try and get a better
and I discovered that one was missing
Was missing
and I thought ooh where is it 
Oh, all 
I started to look around and I put my hand up and it was lying at the back of my collar
Mhm
so it must come off very easily
must come off very easily somehow 
so it, so I'm tempted , not to hand, you know, to take them all off before handing them out
Yes
if I'm giving a single ear piece, cos they won't be quiet, otherwise they will get lost that way
Mhm
very, very simple 
Are they terribly expensive?
Shouldn't think so, I don't know, I haven't managed to contact,
to find out
I was just wondering whether it's something, you know, you buy a
Yes
Mhm
probably aren't that expensive 
What happens about hygiene with those as well?
Well in, you could clean them with stuff is 
You can clean them?
There's, the thing is they're terribly expensive if you, if you don't exactly have any money
Yeah
which is what the position at the moment 
Aha, I see 
mm 
aha, and we will have to think about some sort of contingency fund around to, for replacements whatever
that's part of the bigger discussion
Mm
Well, anyway, yes, sorry, that was
Well 
Well not for me, no
Oh no
repairs and renewals are typical are a lot
Mm 
What's the latest from Glasgow then?
The latest from Glasgow is the system is starting up again, we're doing the first one on the twenty fourth of September erm, the Theatre Royal had, we're doing three
Are these, these dates, erm sixth November, fourteenth November?
Yes, sixth November, fourteenth November, what's that?
And the fifth of December, that's the Theatre Royal for Witches
It's sixteenth, I didn't think afterwards, I didn't bring it, wait a minute, sixth, yes, sixth is the Witches cos that's a matinee and ten thirty in the morning 
Ten A M 
Well done 
schools which we hope erm they all come
well done
that's the
that's right
Yes, mm
Then the fifth of December is on
That's all, that's
oh yes the fourteen of November
that's again a Saturday night, er four P M
I, I should think we'd probably have good people going,
Mhm
Right, I haven't done anything about the
at all 
They're trying, encouraging to Cathy to show some interest
Oh yes I have
which is more than I have
and I laid back so that the fashion might
I was coming to do all again sort of thing, you know, I mean they suddenly announced who
I really I was seeing her, because I wasn't happy about the publicity, the way it had described audio description I didn't think it was good and Alex  was unhappy about the way they were describing some language things, which cos they're not doing erm, and we just went in and he just said right just, erm  well I've kept you some seats for a performance on the sixteenth of September, this was about the
Oh aye, twenty fourth of August or something
Aha, you know, since a week goes on and erm and that's it, aha, not ring me up and say hi there we're thinking of 
So if you hadn't happened to of gone you know
Aha, so if I hadn't haven't, goodness knows, aha, so I mean we, I had a chat with Iris obviously, but it just wasn't on, with other commitments and different things, it was in the afternoon 
Apart from anything else, we, we don't just go to the theatre we have, we really tend to wait to be invited
Mhm
erm, now, and erm, anyway I refused to say anything about the
until I could see physically they have rebuilt it, I mean I won't even say yes we'll do it if you do it, I'm going to say you do it and we'll give you a 
 

description, because there's no way I'm going to go into that position again, no
Yeah, just to, to fill Brian in with that.
They had a great deal of trouble 
Mm 
we hadn't done anything since they rebuilt the St Paul's Theatre
Mm
and they assured us there would be a bit incorporated for audio description, so what it was, was half of us entrance into the lighted sound box, cut off, it was a, sort of triangular, but erm, to see out the window 
This is good, yeah
I, standing on my tiptoes I couldn't see out the window to, to look out to the stage erm, and there was a huge step up, it was about that, which was great for people's bad backs and if you got up on that, erm then you sat on top of a very high cocktail chair, in fact one of our people had to kneel on top of the high cocktail chair, to look, to see down, over the window, down to the stage and they didn't give us a sound feed which would sound familiar
Yes it does 
because there's no sound feed and altogether, oh yes, for the second, we, we did two plays and for the second one, they didn't produce a script
No
so I described them how to do it, perched on our knees, looking down, no sound without a script, it was just absolutely ludicrous
Yeah, it's exactly that kind of experience that I think has got me thinking about what I was saying before you came, well before we were just doing the coffee, about the idea of actually starting to draw, well I was calling contracts, but probably it's more better called agreements, about you know, the theatre will do this, we will do that and
Mhm
you know, maybe even have cut-off dates so that if there isn't, you know, a script by such and such a date then we will need to figure out what these dates were, but this is why got more on board 
Over the 
to give the theatre side more of 
The sort of he's doing more than me
Yes
the sort of contracts you would, you know, I mean, you, you have with producers anyway managements 
Mm 
and, and artists and things that you know, we could maybe, I don't want to make it, you know a twenty five page
Mhm
you know a legal document, but I mean maybe we can reach some sort of middle ground that would be a kind of guidelines and
Mhm
I mean once
The only thing I can see there is the different venues will obviously will have different, differences to cope with that 
Of course, of course , yeah 
Well that's something we would obviously have to sort of, I mean maybe it's something where  you know I mean with the
there's a regularity about it now
Mhm 
Mm, yes 
which I suppose it might be difficult to see what had to be arranged for that with you there's a regularity, but you know the Trone is obviously a
one-offish basis, I mean we are talking a certain one of 
There are certain basics , there are certain basics
Yeah
that if they're not there we can't do 
You can't do it 
That's right 
Yeah
and the theatre must know when you're actually going to see the, the show 
Yeah 
because you've got to arrange seats
Mm, yes
That's right
So if the, a script  there, at least when you're there
Mhm
erm
You see the message had obviously got through because that 
At the latest 
day he just handed me script
Yeah
handed me it but even then 
that's all you need when you turn up and forget the 
I said 
script that's enough
Well I don't I said, I said I'll take it, but I said that I really don't, I mean I said it's really, I said I've explained very carefully it's Iris who had all that yes, ah, but here's a script, so you see, that had at least got through
That got through
but I think what we need to do is go down, well Iris and I will go down there, make arrangements will go down, go down the office
And talk it through
and will have, have, a look
Yes
have, Iris can have another look, but erm, but it's incredible because I mean that's, that really was
 
It really was it was 
worse than what I thought 
Sorry what I was gonna suggest on that in a way this is kind of preempting something else, you know, the, the bit on the agenda for it, I always put them in its back, back together when I write, erm
yes, yes maybe you and I can sit down
Mhm
and, and kind of erm some time one afternoon or something and kind of go through these things
Mhm
erm or maybe I'll consider you two down, you know as the describing side
Yes
the theatre side and just say 
Yes that might in fact be practical in 
Yes 
and then sort of come up 
Mhm 
with, with a draft if you like and then we can talk it round, you know
Yes
just so that we can try and work it out, so that you know if we are going to, to go to new theatres like, you know, I think the New Travellers is going to be interested
Yes
but obviously it's pretty busy now but you know we can go to them and say this is what we found, you know
Mhm
as you say 
it's all 
every theatre is going to be different, but I think there is a basics
Mhm
there are basics
We've already been along there 
Have you?
Oh 
Have they?
Right, well you're already ahead of me in that case 
the Friday night as to look at different things 
I mean I knew they wouldn't be
The only thing is I would hope it would be, it would be very simple and basic and nice 
Well that's what worries me is
because I don't want to put them off either, I mean if we've got to the
 
Oh no 
and said this is what you do, they would of heaved us straight out the door
 
Yes I think that's something we would have to kind of balance up is, is that kind of making 
Can I no, not, not telling them what to do 
No this is, this is what we need and this is what
you need
you need and 
Yes, yes this is what we're giving even though 
yeah, yeah, coming up round to
Yeah and I suppose it's always going to be up for sort of negotiation, I mean I
Oh
have this sort of vision 
Yes 
you know of, of maybe you know a three or four page thing with maybe different, you know different sheets and, and you know sort of say well now we need to do this, can you do that or shall we bring ours you know 
Oh yes, that's right 
yes 
and, and sort of when can we have a script you know and you write it down and take thirty per cent of it, or whatever you know, erm, I mean the other thing that Alex has drawn er
has drawn up for sign language is this sort of flow chart er, with dates and things working backwards from the event, saying you know we need this by two weeks beforehand we need it back 
You've got to book in 
yes, yes you have
and, and I was wondering if that might kind of 
Mhm
Mhm
the thing, I mean again it's, it's different, but
I don't think so I think 
If it's any consolation they totally ignore that 
Yeah 
I don't really, I don't really think it's that that's pinning people down and I think this theatre will be slightly different.
Yeah
Mhm
Because when some plays run for two weeks 
But until there's erm, that's right, I 
and some for three weeks
Yeah
and you wouldn't have the opportunity to go along
No
and I think, I think the difficulty with that is until you know it, as one person said to Alex in front of me ah well, we, we did exactly what you required and you never brought any audience, there was no audience, do you remember that?
That was really embarrassing
Did he really?
Now I mean that, that can happen to us, you know that can happen to us 
Oh yes 
yes 
ag again that's why I don't want you to be heavy cos I don't want say to say oh you know you've brought us you know, fifteen pages and we worked our way through it and then you know at the end of the day we do all of it, yeah 
Where's your audiences?
Yes, yeah 
I think we'll really have to be cautious and that one  
That happened on Saturday 
Mhm
I agree that there are certain things like the sound coming into the
might be able to actually see that real smart 
Yes 
but I mean other than that, I, I, I'd like to be dead cautious about that, I, I still think it's early days, I know we've made a great success, but it's early days.
And we can't guarantee an, an audience, we can never guarantee an audience 
No and there's still some theatre peo no we can't and there's still some theatre people don't want us 
 
of people
That's right  can you tell me, see, there, this list, are any of these please go touring to other theatres?
That's helpful for us to know because maybe even  would want to take one of them for instance, that's already been described
Mhm 
Yes, that's us moving onto Edinburgh now mate
Now, oh sorry aye
we did get on together 
I thought we might 
Inverness
Yes 
Yes it might, you know 
I've got a potential describing Inverness I met her on the train the other day, a friend of my, he says
Aye
asks that 
And Aberdeen still very gracious
Yes, he would be very good in there 
Aberdeen still there 
  

Oh
That's January, right
There's Tooting
well February I suppose, by the time it goes to long
Well the theory was it was even cur His Majesty's
Aberdeen and er Theatre Royal, but I don't have any of them confront
Mhm
and we also booked Tour of the Price, Arthur Miller
Right
Mhm
So there might be some touring in the new year?
And they're touring after they've 
After the new year, yeah 
been here?
after, after the shows, yeah
That'll be, that'll be
 
That's good 
We're gonna start to send something 
 
because we're gonna have to know that in advance because the describers have to be asked if they will be will they be able to travel?
Prepared to travel 
Them to do it 
yes and that, that in a way leads me on to the next party, if we're gonna have an agreement between this group or, you know, the other group
Mhm
bit of this group and, and the theatre, the, the next bit is, is an agreement with the describers about who's doing what 
Yes, yes 
and you know, okay, you're gonna do this show or act three of this show on the twenty third of January and it's going to, that particularly, what not, yeah, erm
Still find a describer who are prepared 
Or if it was 
to travel
if we were going through to Glasgow describers to
Said to do it in reverse
get
You could perhaps get in Edinburgh if they were all busy
 
what's it here or er whatever or even pick up notes from Edinburgh people
Yes
Yeah, I mean it's that kind of co-ordination, yeah, to get that, to get that, right
Today a co-ordination job that is  
Can I tag a wee bit onto that?
how about putting smaller theatre companies like communicado  targeting certain  
Yes 
on the tour
well we're sort of trying an experiment
Iris is trying an experiment
Communicado, erm
seven, eighty four, one
Seven, eighty four, one
Yes, yes, I mean we've, we've sort of talked about it but not done very much about it, Communicado of course is based on the Lyceum which is something which is worth knowing, erm
Because at the moment I mean they're going into some venues out like the Traverse, who were thinking of doing it anyway, but
Yeah, yes, I mean the situation is yes we have kind of thought about it, we haven't actually done it
Right
that's what it comes down to
Yes
I mean the experiment that's coming up is, is the one week only
Mhm
emergence of the Oxford stage company at the moment
I personally think with these smaller of the theat of the theatre companies who spend their life touring more or less
Mm
it would be handy for them to get 
Yes 
their own audio describer
Yes, remember
who would travel with them
With a portable, with a radio systems plug in
Yeah
That would make sense
That really would because I mean they, they 
for the preparation 
it's much easier if they have somebody attached to them
Yeah
Of course they would
they know the play, they know the er act they know the whole thing 
I mean this, this 
get mentioned somewhere along the line of, of you know maybe  you know, I mean God knows how you would fund a
I know
but you know, whether it would be something like, you know 
Yes 
the A, one of the A S Ns would of additional responsibility, it wouldn't be absolutely every performance
You can give the back up team though, you can get people to hand out leaflets and that sort of thing 
You can get 
It may well be a volunteer who's willing to be 
within the group
within, within the group, you know, or volunteer not attached to the 
who's not a part, yeah 
the company who's willing to come
Mhm, yes, yes just to go along
I mean you'd need to look at the touring schedules and things
Yes
Maybe what we should do actually is before too long because of the planning involved is actually approach Communicado 
Pull, pull 
yeah 
to just say you know, what are you doing sort of 
Mhm
yeah
doing next year for a tour, what touring plans have you got
Mhm
and see if there's any, anything in that, cos you wouldn't be looking at doing every single village hall
No
No
but you, you could sort of 
Mm
try them.
You see there's a difference as well 
Mm, if they had someone with them, it wouldn't be a problem
Yeah
I'm sure it's like joining the circus I wouldn't of thought you'd have a problem getting involved in it 
That's right, I wouldn't 
you'd be delighted to go for
mm, well it depends on the touring pattern as well because I mean something like Communicado can sort of kind of do a week here, or a fortnight somewhere
Mhm
another group shown can literally doing one night stands
Yes
around the country, then you know, did sort of think about that, I suppose Communicado can 
 
as well 
is there is there a pulling o off people's schedules just now, people sort of central sort of information point 
There isn't 
No 
That's something that we're needing
That's the problem
that's one of the things we're, we're trying to identify of 
That's what we do need, yes 
a way of doing that
Right
but I mean certainly I think it'll be worth erm
Yeah
looking at the Communicado the touring idea
Erm, I, I did the same thing the tag
as I said earlier erm I suggested to them that perhaps as they went out so much perhaps one the company would do it, they sounded quite enthusiastic
Right 
Yes 
and one of the girls who I was speaking to, oh I'd like to do that, she couldn't for the, the one that we're doing
No
but erm I, I mean I, they obviously didn't say oh no that'll be a rotten idea, so
Oh no
Mm
I think they might look kindly on it
Yeah, oh we should explore that as, you know, erm  I mean how far have do people like Communicado and
erm, yes so if we went to them sort of fairly soon we'd 
Yes 
have a good idea of what they were doing next, next summer or whatever, yeah  right  right, otherwise Edinburgh, erm everything is in place for the festival descriptions, well everything's in place  like curtain up for the Lyceum description, last weekend
Yes, yes
Iris and I standing in the  
 
where were you
and I thought he's not, he 
so what's the position in the future, is it, are we going to have to go through that every time or?
No, no, no, no
Or that
Is that in though?
Now that we know 
I must admit I was 
now that we know what the problem is, we get, we're on top of it .
I was seething at your sign person because I thought we have no way of doing this for about at least two months
Mm
why the night before, did, was I told oh you'll need an amplifier and she's going to bring in one from her home, her own one in tomorrow morning, I thought I didn't spring it in last week, anything and then that day when I discovered it still wasn't working I just couldn't believe it
Oh it's 
 
I mean I said to Shaun on a Friday night we'd better decide this, otherwise there's no point in us coming through tomorrow mate, we might as well stay at home and go to the football or something 
Mhm
so
That's it now is it?
That's it
Yeah, put it on top of that one there 
Good, great 
Erm
Have a bit of trust 
I have, that was my job
You're alright on the night, I'm sure you've heard that expression 
Quite 
Oh yes, as they were filming at the Lyceum last week they were, it were a good programme I can tell you
 
 
Anyway that, that the last thing, the only thing is of course we've missed the, the publication date for your
For the season
for the season
Yeah
which is a pity
yeah, yeah
Well that's of a, one of those things.
The erm, we did invite Ingy to come to this meeting just to report about the festival things, but er she, when I saw her, down at the Lyceum, she was sort of doubtful, erm just because you know
Yeah
it's still the first one, she's got a billion things to do, we'll obviously speak to her in the autumn, erm
Mm, that's good yeah
there wasn't anybody at the assembly hall for the National Theatre, well
I really was disappointed in that, yeah 
No, no blind consumers as it were so that was a disappointment 
that was too bad 
I mean and, and I mean I turned up about half an hour before the end and, and Iris really was looking a, I, I can confirm a picture of dejection
Yeah
That's very sad
I, I, I thought it was a great pity because I mean it's er a major thing upsetting 
Mm 
One reason I was disappointed is because what it says in these minutes, Robert's people reported they'd been speaking to the R and Abbey Leisure Service in London that had been considerable interest in the Edinburgh Festival Programme and in everything
Mm, yes
ranging from when I went to Leeds to that seminar and there were people excited about the Festival and you know, two weeks before the Festival speaking to Jane  in London, said oh we've had a lot of you know and I said well I'll get back to you in September and tell you
Yes
and she said well I'll be able to tell you how many enquiries we've had and so you know, you were expecting something you know 
Nobody's there, mm 
Well at the Lyceum, there was one lady from the South
Mhm
about
Yes I remember you saying about
that they, just the others are all local, so at least there was one Festival visitor proper 
That's good yes 
erm and I know they sold about five or six tickets at least next week 
Next week 
for this the Church Hill, but I don't know where they're from, I don't know if they're local people or from the Festival
Aha, I wonder how
One thing that, that we did spend, I mean, I don't know the Festival seems to come in an awful rush this time I suppose cos, cos 
Oh it does 
my holiday was later as usual and longer so, you know and there was a couple of other things not related to this which I'd thought of doing and it's sort of they evaporated, but erm, we did spend time talking to Ingy earlier in the year, you know, about publicity and I gave her lists of well such as things obvious things like Playback and Newsbeat
Yes
and Newsbeat dinner piece and I expect you did as well, erm but you know, she was, she was talking about contacts and things like Good Morning Scotland and all of the rest of it and I don't think any of that kind of happened
Mm
Mm
er I mean I'm not sort of trying to point the finger at her, but
No, because it may well be that they said oh we've covered audio description before, nothing new 
Yeah 
Yeah, that's right 
we were covering some
this morning or something
Yes
Yes exactly and events overtakes things and, and, and whatnot.
I tell you what I was quite disappointed as that, there was no, didn't seem to be a couple of stair up in the box office either the Lyceum I could see or there's not that there's 
On the day 
assembly hall has a, has a thing, but
Yeah
erm no I mean it's, it's good to see them on they were, they, the programme on, on the fourth of November will be audio described
Yeah
Yes
Mhm
for the visually impaired, you know that kind of thing somebody booking their seat will say oh Aunty Mary might be interested.
Aha
That was the other thing I think about the Festival programme which I think was a bit embarrassed about is the fact that all that information is in such teeny tiny writing
That's right
Yes, yes
which is difficult for me with my
Yes
Difficult for anybody 
okay sight to read you know, my, my recently tested sight, and erm
Mhm
oh, er let alone anybody  
Most 
Yes he went and got glasses, yeah 
As a result of your training er
Yeah
Really,
session
But that's, that, that, that is the bigger thing 
So you know, the sight's something else, I don't I don't know, what I'm wondering is what, you know, what, you know 
Can do it 
what Ingy is gonna come back you know 
Yes, er 
in a month's time and whenever she comes
Yes
Mhm
to, to, to a meeting for the group for next year, you know, she's gonna say well you know we tried it and nobody came
That's right
we're not doing it again, I don't think she will, but I mean I think we need to be sort of positive about how we are going to sort of 
Well I, I erm
build it on
put a, put a very strong piece in Playback this month about audio description and seeing that, it, you know, how disappointed it is for how, I've, I've explained how much work we've put into er, er 
Yeah, mm 
description and that if people er don't take it up
Yes
then it's likely to fall apart, because the volunteers are going to give up
Mm
That's right
they'll, they'll see us, a play four times and then go along and no one comes to hear the description
That's right
Mm
so, erm I hope that, that might make few people visit, but then as I said also in it, you can't force people to go to the theatre if they don't want to 
Oh you can't you, you, that's what we we're saying this morning
That's right
Mm
you can take you know horses to water, but 
Horses to water, mm 
you can't get them to drink it
Is that
Yeah, but I think some works
one is transport and I said this before to you 
Oh yes, very much, yes 
and this is the difficulty, I'll, I'll take this away and see what I can do with it, I mean there's that East End thing, you know, that arts erm you know 
Yes, one 
and the shop mobilities well you know
Mhm
and I'm just wondering if maybe, maybe we will just have to do a wee bit of work and try and get something on the go to see if somebody will 
Yes 
accompany, I don't know that I can offer transport because it's not a very easy thing you know, and we need to try and do, but 
Well we now have started this concert and theatre goers group in Glasgow and, and the 
Yes, well this is what I was going to 
Yes, that's the other side of the 
that's right
They've actually started now, they've got a committee, of course I don't know how long it will take them to get going for them, but 
Yes, oh God 
you see they likely can get a grant from the Society now that they're 
Exactly 
a proper group and er I don't know how they can arrange transport, but I think that's what they're planning to do.
Well it's, do you still have that
It'll be worth
Mm
transport subsidy schemes, is that still work?
Mhm 
Oh, oh, oh 
This is some well 
That's right, yes
Mhm
how does it work?
Does it still
Erm, you've got to go over a certain size to get  a portion of the fee of paid
Mm
Mm
Mm
this is from the Arts Council?
I see, that, that, it's very complicated for blind people
It's complicated for anybody
Anybody 
Absolutely 
 
ludicrous, impossible to try and organize
Ah
but then
We've got groups of volunteers who take people to theatre as well as art
Ah, ha
I think the other side of the Festival as well, you mustn't lose track of, is that the Festival 
Yes, it's, I could of brought people through, I should of been able to
the Festival also chooses its own plays, I mean the Festival choose those three plays and whether they were the best three plays to choose 
Mm, yes, aha 
you know, but you would of thought the National Theatre, but I mean it's, you know
I know
the Spanish play in England 
Yeah 
but you know
Mhm
I don't know, it's difficult to know
Well I don't know, I feel quite guilty because I think maybe I could of done a bit more, but I'll certainly take it away now and I'll have a chat with some of the
Mhm
maybe meet Alan together rather than separately 
Yes 
cos he doesn't, you know, original Council but, but I think we should of, could look inside and I 
I think then 
could of brought a group of people
Yes, I think the other side of Iris's point about the theatre and concert goers club, is quite an interesting idea
Yes
to, to run alongside audio description groups, you could be
Mhm
and this is something I could change my hands slightly about and come back and speak to you 
Mhm
for example about, because you know one of the things that I've thought about for quite a long time is the idea of encouraging voluntary organizations, concerned with the disability to get more interested in the arts and that's obviously what Mecca is
Mhm
I thought of Hugh  being up in Perth
Mhm
Yeah
er with the Spastics is
Mhm
taking people to arts events and getting things that way
Mhm
so it's not a way of reaching people with a disability and, you know, that might be that kind of
Mhm
you're talking about, might be one way of getting
I feel sure if you offer to pick people up and take them home again, you'll be, you'll be swamped you won't know what to do with them 
Absolutely it makes such a lot of difference that's right, yes
It really does and can you blame people
No
I mean I've just come through there and I had a car today and a girl was telling me her father erm opened his door last week er cataract and the, the wife, the granny blind too and there, the man from the water board was just going to switch off your water, just okay if I check your taps, three hundred pounds out the house
Mhm
Mm
now, you know, they've been watching them, they know they're a blind couple, I mean blind people feel that vulnerable that you're asking them to go 
Mm 
Yes 
out so you just, so maybe just, maybe, I've taken a slight hard line to say no, people have got to make a wee bit effort too, but maybe in fact
Maybe they do need the encouragement 
to go back, because to do this to get to this stage and find we're not getting our audiences then, if that's the answer we'll just have to find the solution.
Mm
Is there not two separate problems that we have to find them first and then the, then worrying about getting people to the theatre
Well I think we can find them through Playback in cases like that 
Yes, yes 
I mean if places like that, I mean if you set, I mean she knows this 
If you were to press this thing 
if you say in Playback there is an added night performance 
there will be a bus 
you might get a phone call, if you say there's an
performance
Mm
you know if you're in this area or that area we'll pick you up and take you home and the phone just doesn't stop ringing 
Yeah, there's a bus going 
You got, yeah 
Yes
so I think there's a way of getting the blind people
Yeah
Yes I think there is
but it's, it's just this all for a transport
Yes
Right
and what you've got to be very careful, cos you can't offer them and not come up with the goods
Mhm
so it's a bit trying to set up a system 
It's got to be consistent as well 
Yes
Yeah
Mm, but I'm, I'm sure, I'm sure we can do more there, you know,
Oh yes
I, I did briefly manage from
I think so, of
mention this 
of transport you'll get people
to, to
from art link, erm
to do the escort service and they, they, they do it, I mean 
Oh yes 
what he, he's moving, he's moving actually a bit more towards the East End model in Glasgow
Is he?
Aha
er towards actually, you know, for example he is targeting West
and so on, but he's moving away from being a completely response lead
Mhm
so that, you know they sit in the office
Right
and people phone up to ask being a bit more kind of pro active about it
Yes
Oh I see, right 
and his response when, you're doing the audio description as well, you know if the Society for the Blind wants to organize, I mean
I mean you can organize every kind of thing why does it have to involve us?
But I mean I'm sure there's a sort of, there could be a meeting of, of the sort of ways there somewhere
Mhm
erm
If we or organize the transport will you supply the volunteers?
Yeah, I mean there could be a way of sort of coming together
Mm
so maybe that's another area, and that's a meeting we could set up quite easily with, well with Clare  who runs it, and erm
Mhm
with er
in Glasgow and that's 
Mhm 
whose name I can't remember
neither can I
er  can't remember Debbie
I can't remember the guy's name either 
It doesn't matter
and brought these, the bloke, so.
So
Right, okay
Brampton is happening is it?
Mhm
Jane the last one 
we're talking of Brampton
the Lyceum
Yeah
Is it, what is it definite, I mean as a regular or just the one off or what?
As a regular monthly thing
Mhm, good, that's going to happen
when, when, oh sorry
I was going to, one of the, the many things that I went to away last meeting with was, was the idea of, that I've missed it this time for Playback is a list, a listings kind of mechanism, so obviously this is the first one
Yeah
erm, I was also going to use, erm, the erm R I B kind of format that they use for their listings you know for their leisure lists
Mhm
just because it's the style
Yeah
just go and swipe that
Mm
Mhm
erm, so it'll be useful to have the Brampton dates
Dates
erm
I haven't got them
and this, is something I would need to
The, the thing is that I've been concerned for some time when it's finally helped,f f found for next month, because
because we've got three things happening on one night 
the twenty fourth, yes, of September 
Yes 
three, three separate, I mean, if people from
sometimes come through to Edinburgh
Yeah
people
sometimes come to Glasgow and either of them could go up to Stirling
Yeah
That's right
Three in the one night I think is just
Yeah I feel guilty, I feel guilty about the Stirling one, but when I arranged 
It's very silly 
the Stirling date with the woman from the Oxford Stage Companies in time
with Robert, it was the beginning of the summer in June or something like that
Yes
and I suppose I should of gone off the Thursday night
it's difficult, cos yeah, the Thursday night was a bad night, any other night might of been better 
but erm
I'm worried about that because we had a very bad experience in Stirling before so 
Yeah 
we really don't need it
I tried to see Liz about that last week, but that's anyway, but, but
Yes
to get back to the scheduling I mean that's something we obviously need to think about
Mhm
I've got Brampton theatre dates, I'll copy that, you can have that if you want 
Oh great 
Erm
what is it a Thursday as well?
No Saturday matinee
Oh that's terrific
That is good
Mhm so that's definitely on, yes 
That's ideal, yes 
So I think that's something
Just a quick
to think about
You see I think that's, what, what is like the
They don't tie up with you 
No, there okay , no not at all 
they don't tie up with you so you're alright.
Yes, so we need to sort of keep on top of that one and I'm not really sure until we do get our
co-ordinator how we cope 
Well, well we see that's, that's why and, and I did seem to go about, I don't
Iris's job, but I really wanted to raise that this time, we really have to have someone very, very quickly to protest, call it what you like
Yeah
but we're gonna have to have somebody 
Just to programme it 
because already it's going on, you can see that.
Well
Do we want somebody who will just do, cos I've got, I mean I can get somebody just to do that if that's all you want done, that could be done easily
Mm
in braille or print or braille and print or anything you like, put all the lists together
Mm
Can I say I think that's like the, the door closing and the horse gone, you know
Mm
Before that 
it's the bit before that
Yeah I thought 
unfortunately and I know and that's how much complicated bit 
Yes it is 
and that's can I phoning round everybody keeping tabs, what are you planning over the next three months, aha
That's right
Would it be worth having I mean 
I could certainly get all those lists
You know what I mean, I mean that would and that, and that still necessary that's, that's as well as that 
Would it be worth actually having a, having a sort of a planning meeting, say you know for the first half hour of one of these meetings, the next one say that we have, you know, a wall planner, you know, a chart and 
Yeah 
you know sort of say this is
But is not, I mean it's too late at the moment because both the Citizen and 
It's too late 
and the Lyceum have organized it
Yeah
their dates erm  so happens as far as I can see only the twenty fourth of September
Is appropriate
Is the one
I don't know about the, the after the New Year, but that's very lucky that one 
Cos the other problem is Christmas is one that which is coming off
Christmas yeah, aha
Yeah
well I don't think it matters so much in with the 
People 
on same date because people are like, more likely to go to their own local pantomime aren't they?
They all go 
don't they, yeah 
Mm
Oh children 
So there is a problem about
you need to watch about children this year because, erm, because of the children at the Royal Blind School
Oh yes
and maybe you know from Glasgow whatever
the
absolutely nothing they've got it, none of the audience paid things.
I remember when I first went to see Mrs  
came over 
I don't think, is Mrs  still there?
Yes, aha
She wasn't very keen
No she's not very keen
this was like three years ago
Yeah
Ah, it's not terribly blind is it?
She is not 
This is
the children will be out of school, they might even be sighted people.
Romeo and Juliet I mean it couldn't of been a better thing for school children
Wonderful that
Yeah, that was planned that we 
Yes exactly
Exactly and we went to the school, we told them all about it, we phoned the school, we kept saying 
Not even the older children?
it's going to be on, nobody, nobody, not one person.
Oh no, no, but I'm sure the children didn't even get 
Because at least all schools have wonderful 
to hear about it
Mm
That's a shame you know, because that's the ideal isn't it, remember those wee titchy things at four 
That's right 
all my staff were crying which didn't help 
had to keep dragging them off to the toilet, they'd never seen blind children you see they'd all seen adults
it's fine to be blind to be an adult, but these wee titchy things and there's a little boy saying, you know I was really looking forward to this, this is really exciting, totally blind ooh
but I mean it was so good, because remember the letter we got from the wee boy with the drawing?
That's right
Is this great big painting, a mass of colours, you know, but a wonderful time, cos it's the children you need
Mm
the children are tomorrow's audience
That's right, yes
That's right, yes
I'm very disappointed with that 
if you get the children, yes, not one thing 
Can you not bypass Mrs ?
No you're joking
No
Surely you can bypass if you think 
Seems to be our fault if it's anything to do with the Society she doesn't want to know 
Of course, try Jim  who'd do it
He's fine, he thinks it's a good idea 
Oh yes 
he'll certainly put the information
he'll maybe do a job by, by putting
Wouldn't bypass 
by woman who went to work 
he wouldn't bypass her
He wouldn't?
No
I wonder if I approached her 
May be a way round is the parent protected teachers 
Very possessive 
Parent, yeah
Yes I might approach her
Maybe that's a way round 
direct from 
I'll have a go, yes, yes
Yeah
cos she's all
Mhm
Yeah, oh yes Newspeak's rubbish, but Playback's wonderful, but I think that could be true  
 

I think I might approach her direct and see how anguished we are to get younger people interested in  
That's a shame because children are really the key to this 
It's a shame 
They are they are the key
if you can get them going while they're at school
You know, I mean, this is an organization we are quite keen to get these people as well, I mean their publicity 
Of course 
Yeah 
Yeah
machine isn't reaching them because we don't have any contacts to send
That's right
so perhaps I should
Ring Lucy
try and get a list of contacts or something to, I mean Lucy's quite happy to do it and
The information we can print 
Yeah, the whole lot 
for schools, you know
We can get your lists into the braille press and the workshops, I mean
Mhm
that would help wouldn't it, send that 
Maybe, maybe maybe I could do it from the theatre, would, would help
Mhm
A different, a different 
 
a different approach
Yeah
Yes, because it's not 
it could be 
a society it's not
Yeah
We are, we are offering this for our fund 
And these were the dates 
That's right, yeah 
Yeah 
that'll be super
And get the letter all brailled and everything so it goes down to the  
Absolutely 
That's right 
can braille that for you no problem
Yeah
and, and er she would sort of say oh and here's a theatre make a wee bit effort yes that might be the answer 
That's right, that might be the answer for the braille press, for the school and 
Yes 
for the workshop
And it's directly from the theatre
What about, what, erm
and that's your braille customer
Mm
would it be any help for
Cos I mean that's what their publicity machine is there for 
That's right 
That's right, that's
that can be 
what about 
brailled easily
what about the pantomime, I mean I don't like to say this but there's a society in Glasgow buying tickets for the children for pantomime
Yes
is there a society here like to do that?
