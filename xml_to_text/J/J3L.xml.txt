Atlantic fisheries in crisis
Over-exploitation has led to a collapse in numbers of bluefish tuna, swordfish and cod in the Atlantic.
The Atlantic swordfish is at half 1978 levels, while breeding populations of bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic are down by 90 per cent since 1975, from an estimated 250,000 to 22,000.
A mature bluefin tuna can fetch US$30,000 on the Japanese market.
A conference was held by the UN to discuss the problem this summer, following on from last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, but was mainly devoted to national issues such as data collection and dispute settlement.
Environmental groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature had argued that it should focus on issues such as the development and use of selective fishing gear, reduction of waste, the protection and restoration of endangered species and the preservation of marine habitats.

Risk to children from pesticides "underestimated" 
A new report by the US National Research Council, commissioned by the US Congress, has warned that children face disproportionate risks from pesticide residues in food.
The report reinforces the conclusions of an earlier study by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1989.
The 1989 report concluded that children receive greater exposure to pesticide residues than adults.
This is in part because, relative to their weight, they consume both more food and larger quantities of fruit, which is more likely to contain significant levels of pesticides.
Tests conducted on animals suggested that children are also more likely to retain a greater dose of certain toxins because of increased absorption and decreased elimination.
Detoxifying enzymes and mechanisms are also less well developed in children and adults.
The new report confirmed these concerns, questioning whether existing toxicity tests were sufficient to take account of these issues.
It called for changes in US regulatory practice to reflect this, and demanded that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) take more account of health concerns when setting safe levels.
It suggested that the conventional "safety factor" which allows for uncertainty in extrapolating the results of animal tests, and for variations in sensitivity among humans, should be increased by a factor of 10 when there is evidence of post-natal toxicity, or where data relative to children is lacking.
A further report by the Environment Working Group questions the effectiveness of test routines in US Food and Drug Administration laboratories.
It claims that from 80 to 100 per cent of residue analysis tests at 12 FDA laboratories failed to find 80 per cent of the pesticides used in agriculture.
It suggested that millions of US children were receiving up to 35 per cent of their entire lifetime dose of carcinogens by the age of five, and calls for cuts in pesticide use, including the phasing out of all those classed by the EPA as carcinogens.
The EPA and FDA, together with the Department of Agriculture, promised that they would use both reports "as a basis for formulating the legislative and regulatory policies needed to put the Administration's principles [for cutting pesticide use]into effect" .

OECD launches Pesticide Forum
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD â€” grouping the major industrialized nations) is to launch a three-year "Pesticides Activity" .
It will have three major goals: i) promoting sound, consistent national pesticides registration procedures; ii) sharing the work of re-registration of old pesticides; iii) reducing risks to human health and the environment associated with pesticide use.
The Activity is to be co-ordinated by a Pesticides Forum comprising government regulators and representatives from NGOs including farming and environmental groups, and international bodies such as the UN Environment Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Health Organization.
One of its prime thrusts will be achieving harmonization of data requirements, testing methods and review processes used in pesticide registration.

Protests over plant patents
Protests are being staged by farmers and environmentalists in India and the UK to highlight the threat to native plants by Western companies seeking patents over traditional plant extracts.
The specific case generating anger in India involved W.R. Grace, a US company.
Grace is claiming patents for products derived from the natural oils of neem, an evergreen tree, which are used locally for insecticides, contraceptives and soap.
Under the proposals for the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), genetically-engineered plant varieties are to be protected by patents or similar legislation.
Many opponents of the measures fear that small farmers and others in developing countries will be restricted from using traditional seed varieties and placed at a disadvantage as a result.
W R Grace gained a patent on neem extract, which it called Margosan-O, in 1988, claiming that it had developed a means of stabilizing the extracts.
Grace has set up a plant in India to process neem.
Critics claim that the company will corner the market for neem-based pesticides, drive up the price of neem seed and price local producers out of the market.

UK response to EC habitat directive
The UK government has issued a consultation paper on the further protection of wildlife and habitats designed to conform with an European Community (EC) directive on habitats which is due to come into force in June 1993.
This would involve the creation of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).
The directive requires member states to designate sites with rare and important habitats and species, with priority given to the most threatened sites.
All sites should be protected from damage or development, managed so as to conserve or increase their wildlife value, and monitored.
The government has proposed changing planning laws to ensure that nature conservation agencies and planning authorities abide by the directive.
All sites are to be notified by 2004.
The proposals were attacked as being too weak and vague, with only the minimum legal protection given to sites.
The paper, presented by the Minister of State for the Environment, Tim Yeo, was criticized by the shadow environment secretary, Chris Smith, as being a betrayal of Conservative election manifesto promises.
He said that the existing system of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) had proved ineffectual, with over 500 SSSIs destroyed in the past two years, and that the legal protection to be given to SACs was still unclear.
Conservationists expect the government to rely on the existing network of 5,800 sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), which are given only limited protection under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act.
Friends of the Earth commissioned Dr Derek Ratcliffe, former chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy Council, to draw up a skeleton list of 112 sites which the government should designate under the directive, including internationally rare habitats such as the lowland heaths of Dorset and the Flow Country of Caithness.

Delay on US sanctions on Norway for whaling
The possibility of US trade sanctions being imposed on Norway for defying the international ban on commercial whaling have receded, after President Clinton stated that a delay would allow further time for negotiation.
Norway resumed limited commercial hunting of minke whales earlier this year, breaking the International Whaling Commission ban imposed originally in 1985, and upheld this year.
The Norwegian government argues that the increased numbers of minke whales world-wide justifies resumed hunting.
A quota of 160 whales for the year was set, of which 156 have been caught.

Between 1975-85, 82 sea eagles were imported from Norway to be reintroduced into Scotland.
Of these, 12 have been found dead and fewer than 10 territorial pairs have been established.
A further 10 chicks were brought from Norway this year and released in mid-August.

Modern farming blamed for bird loss
A significant decline in the numbers of some traditional bird species in the UK is due to modern farming methods, according to research published by the British Trust for Ornithology.
The research was based on observation and recording by volunteers of 200 plots of farmland in lowland England and Wales.
Most concern was expressed over the position of seed-eaters.
Nine species of seed-eaters were studied.
Of these, only two, the chaffinch and the greenfinch, registered a slight increase in population over the period.
The others all showed a decline, with four species â€” goldfinch, reed bunting, skylark and linnet â€” accounting for the worst results.
Modern farming methods, particularly in arable crop fields, were thought to be responsible for the declines.
More efficient weed control and the autumn sowing of crops were depriving birds of resources, particularly during the winter months, making the fields highly unattractive habitats.

World Bank doubles environmental lending
The World Bank almost doubled lending for environmental protection in its financial year ending in June.
Out of total environmental lending of US$2,000 million for 23 projects approved last year, the Bank lent US$1,300 million for pollution control and the protection of the urban environment, US$521 million for natural resources management and US$173 million to help build up environmental protection institutions in developing countries.
In its report, The World Bank and the Environment 1993, the Bank acknowledges that despite the increase in lending, a number of weaknesses remain in its environmental policies, particularly on public consultation.
"In many of the projects surveyed, consultation with affected populations and local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had been limited at best.
Where it did occur, it helped improve project design and correct local misconceptions of investments and their impact,"the report says.
The Bank pulled out of India's Narmada project after widespread criticism of the large-scale involuntary resettlement involved [see Energy section, below].
A recent Bank project in north-west Brazil, Planaforo, which aims to help correct some of the damage caused to indigenous peoples by the Bank-funded road through Rondonia state, has itself come under attack.

Brazil boosts sugar power
One-fifth of the electricity in Brazil's Sao Paulo state could soon be generated from sugar cane, following an agreement between the state government and alcohol distilleries.
The cane is used to produce ethanol, used as fuel by one-third of the country's cars.
The pulp, or bagasses, left over from this process is then burnt to produce electricity which at present fuels only the distilleries themselves.
The owners of 150 distilleries have now agreed to sell power to the state electricity companies, and estimate that by replacing the present steam turbines with gas turbines they can increase their output from 200 MW to 3,000 MW in 15 years.
The state will pay the same price for the electricity as it pays to hydroelectric power stations, while the capital cost of the generators will be born by the distilleries, saving the state the US$8,000 million cost of a new 3,000-MW hydroelectric power station.

WEC reports on renewable energy
Coal and nuclear power will be the most "readily available" energy sources when oil reserves start to run out in the middle of the 21st century, according to the latest projections by the World Energy Council (WEC).
The report, the product of four years' work by a special WEC committee, attempts to bring renewable energy sources into the council's calculations for the first time.
The committee's conclusion is that the proportion of world energy consumption supplied by renewables, now 2 per cent, could rise to 4 per cent by 2020: a trebling of the amount of energy supplied by renewables.
This projection is based on current policies, and the assumption that the price of fossil fuels will rise while the cost of renewables will fall.
The report argues, however, that with special help from governments and international initiatives, the renewable energy proportion could rise to 12 per cent.
To achieve this target, cumulative investment of US$2,400,000 million would be required between now and 2020.
Capital investment of US$930,000 million in fossil fuel-based systems would be required to produce the same amount of energy.
The report makes few comparisons, however, between the cost of renewables and that of nuclear power.
The report's definition of renewables covers power generated from wind, solar, geothermal, wave, small-scale water and biomass sources, but excludes large-scale hydroelectric power and "traditional biomass" (wood burning), two of the largest current sources of renewable energy.
If these sources were included, renewable energy would contribute about 18 per cent of current world energy use.

FSC's brief also extends to safeguarding the interests of indigenous peoples and forest dwellers and to promoting timber produced by local communities.

Uncertainty on ice melt
Glaciologists meeting to discuss the impact of global warming on the Antarctic ice sheet have concluded that they are not sure whether rising temperatures could cause a catastrophic rise in sea levels.
Sea levels worldwide would rise by 60 metres if the entire Antarctic ice sheet, which contains 90 per cent of the planet's fresh water, were to melt.
But a much smaller rise could be devastating for many coastal areas and islands.
Recent ice core studies from Antarctica show temperature changes in the past few years far greater than any in the past 400 years.
The evidence indicates that the polar regions are among the first to detect changes arising from greenhouse warming.
Studies are also showing that the edges of the ice shelves are breaking up, to form icebergs, far faster than would be expected.
However, none of the studies have gone on long enough to make reliable predictions.

Grapes and sunflowers flourished in southern England but the real winners were suppliers of insecticides: sales to agriculture and horticulture rose by more than a third in 1989.

Finnish MPs reject nuclear plan
Members of the Finnish parliament voted by 107 to 90 to reject a proposal to build a fifth nuclear power station.
The project to build a 1,000-MW station, was first considered in the mid-1970s, but frozen after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.
The plant, which would have cost between Â£1,100 million and Â£1,700 million, had already been backed by the cabinet, but was rejected by MPs on environmental grounds, despite the boost it would have given to recession-hit Finnish industry.
Finland has four nuclear power stations, generating 2,300 MW of about one-third of its total electricity needs.
Greenpeace described the result of the vote as "of worldwide significance" .

Nuclear Electric promises to go green
In its first environmental report, Nuclear Electric has pledged to stay within self-imposed radiation limits for workers three times more stringent than legal requirements and to foster openness and dialogue with local communities.
It also promised to cut energy and water consumption by 5 per cent this year.
The company said its power stations last year effectively saved the emission of 55 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide emission levels from the generation of electricity by nuclear means were 4 per cent of those produced by coal-fired stations and 8 per cent of gas-fired ones, even when the mining of raw materials and construction running of the plants was included, the company argued.

Greenpeace fails to stop THORP tests but wins locus standi
Greenpeace's High Court legal challenge to the commissioning of British Nuclear Fuels' (BNFL) thermal oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) at Sellafield has failed.
Mr Justice Otton ruled that the government's regulatory authorities had acted rationally and lawfully in allowing the commissioning to go ahead [see ED 74].
However, the judge also rejected BNFL's arguments that Greenpeace did not have sufficient direct interest in the matter to give it the locus standi (or recognised legal status) to appeal to the court for a judicial review.
Mr Justice Otton said: "I reject the argument that Greenpeace is a" mere "or" meddlesome"busybody, or even an officious bystander.
I regard the applicants as eminently respectable and responsible and their interest in the issues raised is sufficient for them to be granted locus standi."
This view was widely seen as having implications for future legal actions by pressure groups.
Greenpeace had argued that the commissioning tests, which involve the use of radioactive materials, should not have been allowed before a final decision on the plant's go-ahead.
The government is expected to take a decision on whether the plant will be allowed to open within a month or two of the ending of the latest round of public consultations on 4 October.
Greenpeace executive director Lord Melchett said that if the government gave the go-ahead without calling a public inquiry, Greenpeace would return to the courts to seek a second judicial review "with our right to do so already established" .
Greenpeace has meanwhile challenged BNFL's claim, in letters to members of parliament, that 5,450 jobs will be lost if THORP is not allowed to go ahead.
It said the figure was four times greater than the estimate made recently by the independent Henley Centre, and that the company was "ruthlessly exploiting the jobs issue" .
* A report submitted as part of the public consultations on THORP says that an extra 200 fatal cancers and 10,000 skin cancers will be caused by the first 10 years of discharges from the plant.
The report by Terramares, a group of Oxford scientists, says many of the deaths would be preventable if discharges were reduced using available technology.
** In the US, legislation proposed by 25 members of the House of Representatives called on President Bill Clinton to initiate "high-level discussions" with the British government with a view to halting the THORP project.
The House has already passed an amendment to the 1994 Defence Bill calling for talks with the UK on cancelling the project and for halting all civilian as well as military plutonium production.
The legislation stated that the plant posed serious environmental hazards and increased the risk of nuclear proliferation.
The call to stop the plant also has the backing of the Pentagon, which points to the proliferation risks of plutonium reprocessing and separation.

Antarctic ozone hole increases
British scientists have revealed that the hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic this year is the largest yet measured.
The regular surveys carried out by the British Antarctic Survey at its Halley Bay and Faraday stations show that two-thirds of the layer had been destroyed before the end of September.
Further loss was expected during October â€” traditionally the time of the deepest holes.

Ozone layer
Cold triggers ozone loss
Low temperatures may be the key to ozone loss in the atmosphere, according to recent studies.
The studies, carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, show that the reactions which convert chlorine into the active form that destroys ozone take place as the temperature drops below 200 degrees Kelvin.
The presence of cold icy particles in polar stratospheric clouds acts as the catalyst unlocking the harmful chlorine, rather than the composition of the particles themselves.
Active chlorine is released during the cold winter months and reacts with ozone in spring, triggered by the arrival of more sunlight.
One implication of the research is that particles entering the stratosphere may trigger ozone depletion, even though they may have quite different chemical compositions to other particles in the stratosphere.

Northern ozone levels at record lows
The northern hemisphere is experiencing record lows in ozone levels, according to data from the World Meteorological Organisation.
The winter and spring months of 1992 and 1993 saw the lowest ever concentrations of total atmospheric ozone over North America, Europe and Siberia between 45 and 65 degrees North.
Winter-to-spring ozone levels in the northern hemisphere declined by about 3 per cent a decade between 1969 and 1989, but the acceleration in recent years means the total decline since 1969 is now 14 per cent.

UK government claims on acid rain
The UK is meeting its international commitments to reduce acid rain, according to the government.
It has published figures claiming that emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide last year were below the quotas given to Britain under the European Community's large combustion plants directive.
The directive covers emissions from power stations, refineries and other heavy industrial plants.
Recorded emissions of sulphur dioxide were 2.67 million tonnes in 1992, while nitrous oxides totalled 701,645 tonnes.
This compares with quotas for the year of 3.25 million tonnes and 925,000 tonnes respectively.
Much of the fall was attributed to the reduced use of coal-fired power stations.
The reductions have been criticized by environmentalists as not going far enough.

Labour policy on asthma week
The UK Labour Party has issued a five-point plan for tackling the growth of cases of asthma.
Labour's environment spokesman, Chris Smith, highlighted the cost of air pollution to the country in health and other terms.
Emissions of nitrogen oxides from vehicles are blamed for much of the dramatic increase in asthma, particularly among children where one in seven suffers from the disease.
The Labour plan calls for an increased effort to meet the EC nitrogen dioxide directive; better monitoring and the regular broadcasting of air quality information on the media; the retrospective fitting of catalytic converters to vehicles; and a halt to the government's road-building programme.

Sweden criticises UK on acid rain
The UK's failure to do its fair share in cutting European air pollution is threatening Sweden's economy, according to Swedish Environment Minister Olof Johansson.
He told a London conference on acid rain that nearly half of southern Sweden's forest soils are seriously damaged now, or at risk of serious damage over the next 15 years.
 "We fear that several Swedish forests are close to their tolerance limits," he said.
 "Apart from alarming effects on biological diversityâ€¦this will have harmful effects on the Swedish economy." 
Britain contributes 11 per cent of the acidity falling on Sweden, secodn only to Germany's 15 per cent, according to Johansson.
The Minister said that most nations were willing to spend between 0.2 and 0.7 per cent of their GDP on reducing acid rain.
The UK's ambitions, he said, involved a cost of 0.1 per cent of GDP.
In negotiations, Britain has offered to cut its emissions of sulphur dioxide to 71 per cent of 1980 levels by 2005, whereas it is widely accepted that a total cut of 80 per cent by 2000 is necessary.
A leading British civil servant, John Murlis of the Department of the Environment, admitted at the conference that British government policy on acid rain had been "tardy" and "highly equivocal" during the 1970s and 1980s.
He said that the British advocacy of the "critical loads" approach "the scientific method used to determine what quantities of acid rain damage ecosystems and hence what reductions in emissions need to be made"  "has often reflected considerations other than critical loads" .
This advocacy, he said, "has been seen by many countries as tainted with a political desire for delay in agreeing further emission reductions" .

Since the programme was proposed at a previous meeting in 1991, only Denmark had actually contributed any funds.
After the Nuuk meeting Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken declared himself disappointed at the "lack of political will" to tackle the problem.
The conference agreed that Russia was the principal source of Arctic pollution, an accusation largely accepted by Russian Environment Minister Viktor Danilian, who called for foreign assistance with pollution abatement and modernization of key industries, notably nickel, copper and cobalt processing in northern Siberia and on the Kola Peninsula.

Pollution threat from abandoned mines
Recent mine closures and the proposed privatisation of British Coal is focusing attention on what is to happen to costly pumping activities.
Water rising through abandoned mines could pollute rivers, kill wildlife and contaminate drinking water.
In County Durham, for example, British Coal is spending Â£6 million a year keeping its remaining coastal pits dry but now has no operational interest in the network of 11 pumping stations.
After centuries of intensive mining, Durham now has no deep pits left in operation.
The National Rivers Authority is in negotiations with British Coal on the issue, and is considering legal action, although it is not clear if this would succeed.
A recent study showed that polluted mine water would start to flow into the River Wear within three months of pumping coming to a stop.

Windsurfer sues water company
Southern Water is being sued for Â£20,000 by a windsurfer who claims he contracted Hepatitis-A from the sea off Eastbourne, Sussex.
James Andrews, a former Lloyds insurance broker, now unemployed, was ill for 18 months.
He claims Southern Water failed in its duty to prevent health problems caused by piping sewage into the sea.
He has been granted legal aid for the case, which if successful could lead to hundreds of other claims.
Researchers at Leicester University are monitoring 400 water sports enthusiasts, who they believe are up to three times more likely to suffer viral disorders than the rest of the population.
EC regulations require water authorities to test sea water for bacteria, but not for viral content.
Research in the USA, however, has shown that the HIV virus can survive, in insufficiently treated sewage which has been pumped out to sea, for up to 12 hours.
Welsh Water is the only British water authority committed to ending the widespread practice of pumping sewage out to sea.

US plans 80 mpg car
Car makers General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are co-operating with the US government on a programme to develop vehicles with three times the fuel economy of today's models.
The target is around 80 miles per gallon (mpg), compared with the current requirement for car makers to produce a fleet whose fuel consumption averages 27.5 mpg.
On average cars sold in the US consume around 28.1 mpg, according to Environmental Protection Agency statistics, twice as efficient as cars sold in the 1970s but with little change in the past seven years.
Government defence and space laboratories will be involved in the research, on development of new lightweight and recyclable materials, three types of new engines (electronic, fuel cell and more efficient petrol engines) and advanced manufacturing techniques.
Environmentalists fear that the programme is designed to conceal a retreat from a campaign pledge made by President Clinton to increase average fuel efficiency required by law to 40 mpg by 2000 and 45 mpg by 2015, which has been fiercely resisted by car companies.
It is also argued that the problem is not the availability of fuel efficient cars but the lack of incentive to buy them, given low US fuel prices.
Clinton's proposals for higher energy taxes have been rejected by Congress.

European airlines are resisting EC moves to improve their environmental standards.
The airlines, facing their fourth successive year in the red, are urging the EC to drop plans to lower maximum noise levels and nitrogen oxide emissions, arguing that they could increase operating costs, reduce the resale value of operators' fleets and put them at a competitive disadvantage to international rivals.
The draft directives still have to be adopted by the European Commission, approved by EC governments and the European Parliament.
New noise standards would then take effect in April 1995, with emissions rules coming into operation in 1996 and being tightened further in 2003.
The airlines believe environmental standards should be agreed through an international framework, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Australians "dying of lead poisoning" 
Over 2,600 Australians are dying needlessly every year of heart attacks linked to high levels of lead in the bloodstream, according to a report commissioned by the National Health and Medical Research Council.
The report found that there was "reasonably consistent evidence" of an association between blood pressure levels and levels of lead in blood.
If elimination of lead in petrol could reduce blood levels by half â€” as the study assumed â€” it would reduce average blood pressure levels by 1 to 2 points, thereby meaning that 12,000 fewer people would need treatment for hypertension annually, there would be 6,000 to 12,000 fewer heart attacks, and up to 2,655 lives would be saved â€” more than the total number of fatalities on the nation's roads each year.
The report added that the study had only considered 35-64 year-olds, and that "the estimated effect would increase dramatically if older age groups were included in the analysis" .
Opposition politicians accused the government of complacency in delaying action to remove lead from petrol.

Road pricing experiment launched in Cambridge
The first experiment in road pricing in the UK has started in the city of Cambridge.
The project is backed by the Department of Transport and is part of a Europe-wide initiative to test and develop road pricing equipment.
The system involves a network of roadside beacons, with "smart cards" , complete with a reader and meter fitted inside the vehicle.
If a car fitted with the reader enters the system area, the roadside beacon will start the meter.
If the speed of the car drops below a certain level because the driver is driving in peak hour congested traffic, the smart card will start deducting units.
Mike Sharpe, Cambridgeshire's director of transport, stated that it was unlikely that any full-scale scheme would be operating before the end of the century.

German recycling scheme close to collapse
Germany's ambitious recycling programme is on the brink of collapse.
Waste management companies which collect used packaging are threatening to stop work unless they are paid the DM200 million they say they are owed by Duales System Deutschland (DSD), the recycling company set up by German industry to manage its responsibilities under the 1991 recycling law.
The government is expected to intervene.
DSD manages the green dot scheme; use of the green dot on packaging allows it to be dumped in special collection bins for recycling.
However, more than half of DSD's members have not paid them the fees that enable them to use the green dot and the company, with a deficit expected to reach DM800 million by the end of the year, is on the verge of bankruptcy.
The scheme's finances have also been hit by low prices for recycled waste, partly caused by the vast quantities now being collected.

EC waste recycling directive watered down
EC environment ministers have moved closer to agreeing targets for recovering and recycling waste.
In doing so they favoured a more flexible approach than that contained in the proposals put forward by the European Commission.
The aim of the original Commission directive was to reduce the vast amounts of waste currently being buried in landfill sites.
It suggested that countries should recover 60 per cent and recycle 40 per cent of each form of packaging material within five years of the directive becoming law, increasing to 90 per cent and 60 per cent respectively after ten years.
Many member states regarded these aims as too ambitious and the targets as too high.
Critics of the directive, including the UK, France, Italy and Spain, pointed to the problems caused in Germany by its failure to cope with its packaging laws.
These states also complained that Germany was dumping waste in other EC states because of its own inability to deal with the high targets it has set itself under its own laws.
The imports were said to be stifling local recycling industries.
The Belgian presidency of the Community suggested a compromise which would allow recovery of waste through incineration, and the setting of an overall target of 40 per cent for the recovery of all forms of waste.

Supermarkets back recycling scheme
British supermarkets, under government pressure to reduce the volume of waste packaging, are backing a door-to-door recycling scheme pioneered in Worthing, West Sussex.
Under the scheme, specially converted dustcarts collect household rubbish, with paper, plastics and aluminium already separated out by householders in plastic crates provided by the local authority.
During the Worthing trial, three-quarters of the 5,000 households involved used the crates to collect recyclable materials.
Now Worthing hopes to convert four of its eight dustcarts with sponsorship from the Institute of Grocery Distribution, the supermarkets' think-tank, to extend the service to half the town.
The Institute plans eventually to extend the service to the whole of West Sussex and Hampshire, about 1 million homes.
Using a single vehicle, to collect normal household rubbish as well as recyclables, is far cheaper than using separate vehicles, as in some other schemes.
The estimated extra cost of the Worthing scheme is Â£2.80 per household per year, against Â£17 for schemes using two vehicles.
