Good god
and from there er Mr  was the er housing manager then from Epping, we came under Epping didn't we?
There wasn't any new town or anything and er they'd built those er Council houses in the front in  and he also erm, he said would I like a nice new house, to have plenty of hot water for the boys for bathing and everything, so I moved into a four bedroom  and er I was there, er brought my family up there for, till er, unfortunately my mother came to live with me and unfortunately erm I had to go away erm because I wasn't very well on a holiday and I was called back cos she was found dead on the toilet my poor mother and er after that erm I came back and erm, in the middle of the week from holiday, oh bother it  will it be okay?
Hello, yeah, Betty's number  , I'm just having a recording done of me while I've been in Harlow  I'm having it done now , yeah, er so I can't stop alright? alright, bye, bye .
It's always the way innit?
Will that come on it?
Will that
No
No that's alright then  and er I, I got into, I came, came back sort of when mother died, had to come back suddenly in the middle of the week and then erm I brought me family up as I say and, and my hubby  he took, he took us Christmas shopping which is twenty one years ago this, this month the sixteenth my daughter-in-law and I and the little boy and that's the little boy over there that's now married, the one with the photograph, he took us shopping at Bishop's Stortford cos we hadn't any shops nothing here then, there was nothing when I first came here it was terrible and we went to Bishop's Stortford and we came home in the, dinner time and I got erm, had our dinner and everything, had our meal, well we had soup and that was gonna cook at night, er you know, dinner at night so we had soup and that and erm he said I go down to the garage to put a tyre on my car, he came struggling back and within half an hour he was dead at fifty six years old that's all he was, so I was left to bring up those that wasn't married, I was left to bring up er the others you know, er I had the twins with me and Roy one of the boys and erm, er Brian the youngest one and I had to bring them up and I, after I, they, they all got married and I moved, before they got married I just got Brian with me the two twins got married, and I moved into my daughter-in-law's house next door which was  no two, seven, five the other side, I'm sorry, two, seven, five and er I was in my house though three years that four bedroom and I couldn't afford to keep you know big house like that going with just three, my, me and my son so we moved into her house and she had the end one which is still in now, we'd done a swap and then cos er, er in the later years I was in there oh a long, long while and I loved it and I didn't wanna move but then I found, I was handicapped, I wouldn't get up the stairs to the toilet so I was moved into this bungalow you see and I had a friend living with me and he erm, he come here to live with me, came to lodge with me because he didn't want to go into Stevenage you see and er, after that erm, after that we, I had this bungalow and er I moved into this bungalow and er he moved in here with me and er everything happened when I got in this bungalow.
The first May I fell out my garden and put my elbow out, this, this, this one right out which makes it awkward for me to use now, you know, I, I put that right out and therefore erm I had to go at, up to hospital and put that right  and the follow the following, the following May my bed caught alight  with electric blanket and that blazed all up, had my, had my bed all alight my double bed, the electric blanket and I'd only just had it serviced and that went, that was the second May and the third May we were going on an outing me and erm Arthur that was lodging with me and he, we got out of the taxi at Parndon and it, he just collapsed and died at me feet so that's the, that was the end of that and I've been living here you know, since he went, and erm I used to be able to get anywhere with one stick cos I had arthritis in this right hip you see, I could get anywhere with one stick in the taxi, or anywhere and I went to my son's, er which is now coming, I've been here about twelve years in this bungalow, er eight years erm, eight years ago in No this November gone, I went down to my son's, it was rather slippery and he took me down in the car and I, as I got out erm the car I said to him mind it's very slippery, he said I won't let you fall mother he said, so I went in, but as I came out with one stick he still hadn't got anything down, you know, if it had been a, a sort of erm sand or something down I wouldn't of slipped and I got half way in his car and out I fell and caught this left hip on the step, on the step and I dislocated my hip and it's right out of the socket like that, it should be, and I can't have it put back because I've had several coronaries in my life time and I cannot have it put back you see
Oh
but er, er as I say while I was round there the new town was, was all built and er I found, we found such a difference cos I used to have to go into Old Harlow shopping, I used to cycle before I was handicapped like this, I used to cycle everywhere, and er I went, you used to have to queue up in Old Harlow for the shops, we hadn't got anything here at all, no Stow or anything when I first, I mean when I came here nothing, it was just terrible  terrible lane up here it was and all these were all ploughed fields and it was really terrible and I had erm, I used to have to cycle into the doctors Old Harlow, queue up, queue up at the butchers, queue up everywhere you had to queue and er, till they built this er the new, The Stow then we used to go to The Stow shopping you know which made such a difference, but er, during my say during my lifetime I've so, so pleased when the new town came because I wanted to move back to Nazeing where I came from when I first got here because it was such a terrible place  there was nothing doing whatever, you know and then I moved erm, as I say after I got round the front there it was more, better really, you know, with all the er traffic and that you could see people going by and that as otherwise it, it was monotonous really in Common Fields, you didn't see much at all there, but you know it was, I quite enjoyed it really, now what else have I got to tell you?
Oh, erm, do you think your life's been changed by the New Town?
Oh yes it's, it's been changed a lot and a, and er, it's made such a difference and I've met er, I've got a er fr a very good friend who's, who's a Red Cross young man who I met at Leah Manning and he takes me out in the car which I wouldn't, never get out otherwise because my boys are all working you see they can't, they're busy working and erm do shift work and security work, one's got his own security business and the other one's got a factory in Bishop's Stortford so that they don't get much chance, they work away, some of them do that they cannot get to take me out see, so he takes me out, which he's very, very good you know, he's, yesterday he took me to erm, yesterday we, he took me to Ongar to see his sister in the bungalow and then he took me for a meal at erm The Chariot at er, at Brentwood, Brentwood, yes Brentwood The Chariot, it was quite nice I had rather, a good time, erm cos usually I can't get out unless I go out in the wheelchair you see I'm confined to a wheelchair, though I struggle out into the kitchen with me two sticks and I've got a stool in there that I do all my own cooking and I make cakes and that and I'm doing a cake gonna make a cake for Christmas for me brother and make a cake, er another one for myself like, but, and then I go to my erm daughter-in-law's to spend Christmas Day and then I, I'm going to my son's and spend Boxing Day which is my birthday, I'll be seventy four on Boxing Day  I'm dreaded to say, yeah, but erm, this young man that takes me lives in Northbrooks, he's er a widower, but he's very, very good, he helps all us old people, you know, he's ever so good he is to me, he comes up and brings my shopping today, does my shopping for me as well, so, well he's, yes, he's most kind, for, nearly two years I've know him, that's a photo over there , it was taken at a wedding look, of my, that's it, over there , taken at a wedding dear, very good
Yeah
No I've made, it's made an awful lot of difference to me the New Town I mean we've got and the Council are very, very good to us, I mean we can't say they're not, they've had a, I've had the gas central heating put in, I've had a shower put in since I've been here and I mean they do they look after us well, the only thing I'm upset about that I've put off the ambulance to go to Leah Manning on a Wednesday because they want me to go on a Tuesday and I cannot go on a Tuesday because I have my friend come down which does all odd jobs for me you know, on a Tuesday dear and I just cannot so I had to see Mr  is it?
The other day

Yeah 
to be with my friends although they let me sit with me friends so they're good really so I'm hoping that I should be able to get back on a Wednesday because er, that's the only day really I can go, I go to Barn Mead on a Thursday as a rule you see, but yesterday I had to have a day off to go out, I had an invite out
Oh
