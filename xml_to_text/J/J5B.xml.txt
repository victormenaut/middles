ECOVER
BIO-DEGRADABLE HOUSEHOLD CLEANING PRODUCTS
FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
ECOVER products provide a unique range of highly effective cleaning agents for use about the home which have a minimum impact on the environment.
They are fully bio-degradable in a maximum of three days*, by which time all the active ingredients are broken down into natural harmless substances.
By using ECOVER products you can contribute to a safer world.
With over 10 years experience of developing and manufacturing ecologically safe products, ECOVER maintains a research laboratory which constantly monitors the composition and quality of the products in accordance with a strict set of standards.
THE ECOVER CODE
These generally break down very slowly and often incompletely, prolonging the polluting effect on our water systems, and endangering the plants, animals and micro-organisms which live in them.
They often contain toxic impurities and may be an irritant to the skin.
Ecover, however, uses only natural vegetable oil based cleaners, derived from renewable resources, which break down rapidly, completely and safely.
NO PETROLEUM BASED INGREDIENTS
These act as an unnatural fertilizer for algae which then use up the oxygen in the water during their rapid growth.
This lack of oxygen decreases the activity of micro-organisms which break down detergents.
Fish and water plants suffer too, and in extreme cases an area of water can be literally suffocated as in the infamous case of Lake Eyrie in North America.
NO PHOSPHATES
N.T.A. was considered the alternative to phosphates in washing powders at the start of the 80's, but it is now banned in the USA because it combines with heavy metals, as does E.D.T.A. In this way carcinogenic substances such as lead, mercury etc., which normally remain at the bottom of lakes and rivers, are reintroduced to the water supply.
These complexed substances are then very difficult to remove in the drinking water production process.
NO N.T.A. OR E.D.T.A.
These are added to washing powders only to give an illusion of whiteness.
They can be extremely irritant to the skin and have a very low degree of bio-degradability in purification plants.
Tests have shown them to restrict growth and cause mutations in micro-organisms.
NO OPTICAL BLEACHES
During the breakdown of these types of bleach, many different kinds of organo-chlorine substances can be produced, some of which are known to be highly toxic and carcinogenic.
NO CHLORINE BLEACHES
These are known to be extremely irritant to the skin and can cause asthmatic reactions in some people.
Cases of pulmonary  haemorrhage have  occurred in workers in factories producing these substances.
NO ENZYMES
Usually petroleum derived, they can be toxic, dangerous to water organisms, often irritant to the skin and very slow to breakdown.
Instead, ECOVER uses only natural plant extracts for perfumes and no colourings at all.
NO SYNTHETIC PERFUMES OR COLOURS
*Washing Powder â€” maximum 5 days.
