Drug abuse wrecks lives and families!
So is it here to stay  or could we, all of us, do without drugs?
We all take drugs in some form or another, some are legal, you can buy them over the counter or your G P may prescribe, those are illegal, but still widely available and used at a price.
What we're looking at in this half hour is why and how we use drugs and what we might change.
And let's start with a question, do you take prescribed, or illegal drugs?
Or have you ever taken?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And if there's anything surprising about that results, it's that nineteen people say they've never taken any kind of drug!
Eighty one have said yes.
What have you taken, or what do you take?
Yes?
Erm,inhaler for asthmatic attack, well to prevent asthmatic attacks.
And have you been taking that for quite a while?
Erm,sin , well  I think, er  about seven years.
And you would go on taking it because it's a
I don't need it very often, erm  I'm not a bad asthmat , it's an allergy to animals 
Right.
so it's  a rare occasion have to use it, but I probably have  to have one with me all, for the rest of my life.
Okay.
Up there.
I take Thyroxin for an under-active thyroid gland.
Mhm.
And these are prescribed drugs then?
Yes.
You get that from your doctor?
Yes?
 Maccresin for a, arthritis.
For arthritis, right.
Yes?
I take  Tamazapam to sleep.
Erm, and I have no side effects to it, I've been on it for quite a long while.
Every night?
Every night.
One every night.
It induces four hours of sleep, and if you sleep after that it's a normal sleep.
I waken up fine
Yeah.
no problems.
And how long have you been doing that?
Erm  nine years.
And why did you start?
I had a bereavement, a very close bereavement in the 
Yeah.
family and they put me onto valium, but having worked in psychiatric I knew the results of valium, so I I gradually broke them down and got off them  but for six full months I couldn't sleep
Mm.
so they did put me onto some.
But, I I kno , I do use them as they're prescribed, one 
Mm.
per night.
And they do help.
So you've got a drug that you can live with?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes?
Steroids.
My mother takes these.
Okay.
Any others?
Yes?
I used illegal drugs  erm 
Yep.
for seven year.
Yo yo you did do?
I did, aye.
Now, now you're the first person who's said you used ill ill illegal drugs, I  yes?
I've took illegal drugs and prescribed drugs.
You did or you do?
Or yo you 
I take prescribed drugs now.
Yes.
But, did you used to take illegal drugs?
Yeah.
Well let's, since we've got onto that  why?
Just to get a hit.
Just to feel good, forget or whatever!
And how old were you when you started doing that?
Started at fourteen or so.
Yeah.
And how did,an how did you begin?
I mean was it  through your  friends or  family or 
You just take one, I just  my pal had a bad  or something and  she was prescribed er  a se , a certain kind of sleeping tablet, Tamazapam and just I started  in to say  amounts up to twenty five at the end of the, do you know what I mean?
It's quite expensive isn't it?
Ah but  you need it.
So, how did you change?
Did you see 
Er  I went er  er sa C D P S
Mhm.
Do you wanna say what that is?
Well it was er  it's Community Drugs Project 
Yep.
Scheme.
And erm  to get pro a nurse, like you get a  along with the nurse.
She's here  er, and she  put me in a hospital and then going off for something.
And that was that?
Mm.
Well 
And you
I'm still on  some stuff.
Yeah.
But she got me so , over the worse part, yeah.
Yeah.
And what would you say to a fourteen year old girl  who might be watching this  who might think of doing the same thing?
Just none of you ever tra da er, it ruins your life, ruins your family and everything!
Don't try it once?
No.
Waste of time!
Would you say the same thing?
Aye, I would gi that.
I would advise 
 
erm, any young person never to try it.
It ruins and wrecks your own life and family's life as well!
Well we've got onto illegal drugs, and of course le or, do you think illegal drugs are attractive almost because they are illegal?
I mean,th there are other things that can give you a hit.
There are, there are legal drugs in our society, and you may not think they should be legal, I don't know, there's  there's er, alcohol, I suppose is the most commonly used one but
It would start probably because they are illegal, erm  but basically because everybody else running about me  er, was trying it, my friends so  it basically boiled down to peer pressure  at the start.
So what were you taking?
Heroin.
From the start?
Mhm.
And did it give you a high?
At the start, aye.
And then what happened?
And then it just became a drug that I had to take for every day use.
Erm, had to take it to feel normal.
And how difficult is it to stop doing that?
Oh it's very difficult.
But now I've been drug-free for over a year  erm  but I'd been trying for a few year before that and had nay managed to  succeed.
But through the help er, the group that I'm well involved in, which is Carlton Athletic Recovery Group
Mhm.
I've managed  to stay straight to day.
And what was the point at which you thought  I want to stop doing this?
I want to get off drugs?
Well the point that I wanted to get off drugs was, my family  not wanting any more to do with me, erm, they'd shut the door on me.
I've got two young sons as well, erm  they two got took off me into foster care, and that was when I really had to decide it was the either the drugs or the children.
So it was one day you made the decision and you stuck with it?
No, not just one day, as I said, I'd been trying for a few 
Yeah.
year but  the end result came  when the two children did get took into foster care  erm, that's when  I realized that it was a problem and I had to do something about it.
What what what do you think of those two experiences?
Yes?
I admire them for being able to sit there in front of everybody and say they actually, what they've been through because it must have been sheer hell  er, trying to come off and withdrawal symptoms, I mean, I don't know much about it cos I've never taken  well I smoke 
 
and I take a drink, but hard drugs  misused drugs  it just must be shu he sheer hell!
And if  they're coming out stating that your families turned their back, they've had enough
Mhm.
who do you turn to?
These, these seem to be extreme stories.
Mhm?
Er, I do believe that er, if the question was asked have people taken less, you know no not heroin
Mm.
but dabbled in it in a a younger age?
And what the response was to it because, well I I did try it merely  sort of to experience it, and I don't think that it was an addictive experience and 
Aha.
I really don't think there was any ill effects at the time.
What, what are we talking about here?
Well erm  just er dope re , you 
Dope.
know, marijuana.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are they bo 
And having smoked the odd joint I don't really feel 
Mm.
that  it was  it was that detrimental.
Okay.
Well le let 
No.
well le , let's ask that tha that question then.
Have you ever used  illegal drugs?
And I'm not going to pick on you so you can feel free to answer the question.
 
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
I mean, nobody has to speak who doesn't want to.
Can I answer that question?
Yes.
Marijuana is nothing like taking  heroin, smack, whatever, it's nothing like it!
I think we should maybe ask the question why youngsters take drugs  and, maybe we would get to the root of the problem.
And what do you think the answer to that is?
Erm, sometimes they'll say they're bored.
Maybe 
Aha.
we have to  try and divert their attention.
Probably the only way to try and prevent it is to go into the schools  and get people that have been through the proble , the problem  theirselves to go into the schools and try and educate the kids to stay off drugs.
Because, you're getting it, I know in the east end of Glasgow where I come from 
Mm.
you're getting them as young as  eleven and twelve  and, they're trying these drugs.
You wonder how they're getting them.
They're getting them because  you've got  old drug addicts going to the doctors getting prescribed drugs that is nay there.
Th the one do they really want them?
But 
Yeah.
it does to get them money  because they can sell that  and then go and get the, the drug they re , they require  theirself .
So they can enter the secondary schools and they're selling it to these young kids that just don't know any better.
Yeah.
So I think if  what we're doing just now, cos I'm part of Carlton Athletic as well, and what we're doing just now is trying to get into the secondary schools in the east end, and getting this message across to the kids not ee  to buy these drugs.
Yep.
Over there.
There actually is a drug-wise  project
Aha.
that is run in the secondary schools in the first year  where the children are talked to by the police and they see videos and they are a act 
They must have terrible programmes!
they are act to 
 
they are, asked to respond to 
Aha.
various situations and they 
Aha.
do role play
Mhm.
and all sorts of things to try and discourage them from this.
You don't think that's a good  thing?
I've , I've used  well I've decided not to use the drug- wise project.
I worked in the east end for a year with young people, I think it's very, very moralistic, I don't like the idea of the police coming in and  and teaching 
What 
the the  group work  sessions.
I to , I think it's a very 
What what what would you pu 
bad package!
What would you prefer?
I think what we should be looking at is pu , campaigning for de-criminalization of soft drugs, like cannabis
Mm.
because  the use of recreational drugs like that is not necessarily problematic.
And I also think that we should looking at harm reduction methods, in schools definitely  not drug- wise.
Yes.
If you carry what 
Mm.
you're saying to it's logical conclusion, then why don't we just  erm, open up Hampden up  sell the stuff there, you know  people, you know, if children want it or  adults 
I don't 
or anyone, why not have 
Well 
it there?
why not?
I mean tha I I I 
 
I don't think that's 
A lot of that isn't harmful.
Is is that what you want for children?
Well we sell alcoho 
Or young people?
we sell alcohol  quite freely.
Well maybe you should just 
Quite socially acceptable.
Wha what do you mean de 
But it 
criminalize?
I mean, do you mean that you would mean that you would get it on 
Yep.
or that it should be a 
 
think it should just be available in  in shops?
With, with certain regulations.
Er 
Yep.
with er, there would be a certain amount of state control.
Er, behind you.
Mhm.
Erm  we talk about cannabis being made 
Mhm.
legal  now, if some of the people here could see the damage  that cannabis does, it's the first step  towards hard drugs!
And I don't know anybody  that addicts, I deal with a lot of addicts, and a lot of families  and it all started on cannabis  so, you should nah talk about legalizing  any drug!
One thing that I think we have to be very careful about, if we did legalize cannabis  there would be a proportion of adolescents  who would get a great kick out of it, but there would those who don't get the kick because it's not illegal.
There are people who feel that it's great to break the law, and  a word of caution, that I feel is important, is that the same group of kids will react against drug programmes in the schools.
I don't know that the school's is the right vehicle for this  because in many ways, the children who are getting into these things pay more attention to the peer group, and it's more important to have community groups, community cafes, things which are not seen as authority getting at them.
So why do
Yeah?
Up, up there.
Up there.
Yes?
I think we really have to look at the Dutch experience and 
Yep.
see  that the fact that in Amsterdam  theyde-criminalized cannabis and they do not have the same kind of problems.
It means that the drug squad there can concentrate on harder drugs, and certainly I I pu , a recent interview with a  a police inspector from Amsterdam said he would rather  deal with, you know, he would rather have cannabis users than certainly alcohol, problems with alcohol.
Mhm.
Yes?
Erm, I just think that over the generations er ma a er perhaps we're forgetting that in the seventies, for instance, er well, cannabis was a  at that time a popular, a popular thing, but you also had ecstasy isn't either the main thing in the in the papers
Mm.
but er, even then if you, if you could go to your doctor, if you wanted slimming tablets, they gave you  Dexadrin or
Mhm.
a derivative of it, which gave you the same high that ecstasy does and er, and if you didn't it from the doctor you could buy it on the street.
So that's twenty two years go, and ecstasy, I think's only the same thing reoccurring.
Mhm.
It's like er a fashion and because it's on the black market, it's infinitely more attractive.
The papers have taken it up, and as such, there's an awful lot of hype about it, and I think makes it more attractive.
Yes?
Well I just wonder you, there has got to be some kind of  relationship between the fact that most people who take drugs live in really run down deprived areas.
I mean, I think tha that you have to look at that.
Because people have got nothing to do!
Er, I mean lots of people have got nothing to do and are unlikely to be employed during that time.
So you think, you think people who live in in well off areas, there's lots to do don't take drugs?
No!


You don't think that?
Oh well, you know  No, I don't think that, but I think that you have to  I mean there has to some kind of relationship between  I'm not saying it's anything to do with the personalities or anything like that but
Yes.
it's got something to do with the fact that  people have got nothing to do in those areas, and no cha , no prospects, no chance of getting a job and it's actually quite a purposeful way of spending your time.
I think that's really patronizing!
You're saying that  
No, but I don't mean to be patronizing.
if I help with addict that they need to compensate for for  er, things missing in their lives, perhaps they just like it.
Yes.
Yeah!
Well maybe.
I mean there's nothing wrong with  I mean people do just like.
I think 


I think if you talk to drug users themselves, we've already heard about some of them talking about coming off drugs
Mhm.
if you talk to drug users who will tell you coming off drugs or withdrawal symptoms are not as hard as many people believe that they are.
What they do find difficult is filling their day once they have actually come off drugs because they have built up a kind of lifestyle that has already been said
Mm.
around their use of drugs
Mhm.
and in areas where there isn't any chance of them 
Mhm.
getting jobs, they find this  really the most difficult part of staying off drugs.
Mhm.
I think there's, there's quite a difference, erm, in between physical dependency and psychological dependency 
Mhm.
when you're talking about taking drugs  and it's been shown that the effects erm  the biological dependency isn't that great and it's no sort of worse than coming off  erm, having a bad cold
Mhm.
whereas a psychological dependency is what's really  you know, difficult and what makes it hard for people to come off drugs.
And studies have shown that if people are injected, even with not a drug  that sort of, satisfies their need for a while, and what does work is a change of environment for people and that does come down to people not, you know, being able to work, people being unemployed, and also peer group pressure like th , the woman said over there .
Erm, if all your friends take drugs then you're more likely to erm, take them and it's harder 
Mm.
to break that habit.
Mhm.
In front, yes?
You.
Like the woman said there, there seems to be a lot of help for people who are on drugs, and who then want to come off them, but the after-care service seems to be  you know, a lot  erm, there's not a lot help for the people, they get the help to come off the drugs and then they're put back into the society that they are from  and they seem to still have that pressure to go back to where they were previously.
Is tha is that, is that true?
Are the support services inadequate?
I mean there are a number of professionals here.
Yes?
Erm, I work in a project at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, and one of the things, there's young who experiment with drugs whether we like it or not, and I think it depends what drug i is available at that time, so we could sit here and go through the different periods of time.
But I think, we've not been good attracting women into services, I think, the responsibility that a woman drug user has over child care and a whole range of other things that male drug users don't have.
Erm, yes 
Mhm.
then I think, we haven't, I think we're getting better at attracting women into services and and  providing what they're looking for but we need to hear from them what they're looking for, erm er with, from those services.
And certainly, if you look residential centres, which is one part of, of a treatment erm of what we have in Scotland or or nationally
Mm.
erm, isn't very good, for women with children in particular.
Mhm.
Isn't it also about the hypocris , hypocrisy of a society that's saying that one kind of a drug is okay, and another sort of a drug isn't okay?
Erm, I mean one 
Which one is wi which ones are you thinking 
Oh.
of?
Well, alcohol's okay.
Yes.
I mean it's okay to come to this studio and, in Edinburgh and walk up a busy street and see people going into pubs and being drunk!
But it's not okay to walk up the same street and see somebody using something else, obviously.
And, surely it's about erm  helping  , I don't know how you go about it but the illegality of it prevents people admitting it and asking for help, and taking erm any advice that people can give about using it safely.
Yeah.
And it's about safe drug use, you know what I 
Mm mm.
mean?
Mm.
Well , safe drug use is quite a challenging concept.
I mean I  may maybe decriminalization is part of that but I, as someone said why sho , why shouldn't people take  er, drugs if they want to, they're allowed to take other drugs?
What do you think about that?
I mean i i 
Well that's what I'm saying, you know drugs  erm, well you're looking at society where we're given drugs to make us feel better.
Mm.
I mean there's a lady down there talking about taking
 Tamazapam to help her sleep and has no problems with that, fair enough!
But there was another lady there talking about taking  Tamazapam as a drug of abuse  and tha , that's the difficulty.
I wonder how many of you have experience of taking tranquillizers?
Do you?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And I'm sure that medical people here will correct me if I'm misusing 
Mm mm.
the term tranquillizers.
Well thirty nine people say yes, sixty one no.
Of those, of those thirty nine has a, has it been a good experience  or not?
Yes?
No!
I had a very 
No?
bad experience with tranquillizers!
My father died erm  sixteen years ago  and I was put on to tranquillizers, up until that point I had never needed a drug in my life, and I was put onto tranquillizers and I had a terrible experience!
Did you ask to be put onto tranquillizers?
No.
Th we th , I think at that time it was just the done thing, you hand out tranquillizers, erm  but I found it a, a really bad experience 
Yeah.
and ended up having to take anti-depressants to  reduce the effects of the tranquillizers.
So you actually became dependant on  the tranquillizers did you or or or you simply had 
Mm.
such bad experience on them?
Ah, yes I, and I've never 
Yeah.
taken one since.
And I refuse under any circumstances to take them!
I'm just going to comment on  the lady over there.
I never went to the extremes with heroin, but I was addicted to valium for seven years  erm  and I've been clean from valium for four months  erm  through a drug programme in  Brenda House 
Right.
Erm
I went to the doctor at seventeen, just about to be married and he put me on Librium to calm me down.
My parents were absolutely shocked when I went home from the doctor, seventeen year old and  living on  drugs, so so to speak, just because I was a bit excited about  getting married !
You know it was   
And di , did you take the Librium?
I was entitled to!
See, extraordinary!
Yes?
I take  Attavan on on a nightly basis
Yep.
simply to  shut off my brain to enable me to sleep, much the same as the 
Mm.
lady over there I've no bad experience with it, I am not muddled-headed during the day
Mhm.
erm, it just allows me  to switch off.
Mhm.
I didn't know specifically asking for a sleeping tablet.
And during the time where  Attavan was getting a very bad press, I went back to the doctor and said, would it be advisable for me to change?
Mm.
I still want something  to turn me off at night, er and is   Attavan that bad?
If so, can you give me an alternative?
And he said, in the  with the, the drug,th , with the amount that I was taking,the , there was no need to co , er concern myself with it.
Don't you think that a lot of doctors are too willing to hand out these tranquillizers?
They see these weak
Yeah.
women coming into their surgeries, highly strung and th the answer to their problems is, give them a tranquillizer and be done with them!
Ye , I feel actually women go, or people in general, go to the doctors expecting a tablet, a prescription, and are very disappointed if they don't get one.
Erm, but I personally think there's a lot of other things that the doctors could be  offering, er, pointing us in the direction of er  relaxation techniques and, all sorts of things.
Erm, I think they're quite good at saying stop smoking, or stop taking it but  we don't offer anything in it's place.
Mm.
And I think that  drug taking has always been here, it will probably always be here, but in most people's life it's a transient thing, it's a phase  perhaps erm  as animals we like to change our mental state?
I don't know, there's ha pu , I think there's a lot of reasons why.
Mhm.
Rec , erm the lady behind was stating that recent a , I mean recently I had about, er went through a bereavement, lost 
Yep.
my brother who I was very close to  went to the doctor  and, instantly he,pres , er prescribed  Tamazapam tablets for me, knowing that I myself am a single parent so I have  a responsibility.
Mm.
I've my daughter to look after.
Didn't ask me anything!
Just looked at me  saw how I was, prescribed the  Tamazapam tablets, and I had a terrible experience with those  and that's only in the last year!
And so, how's that affe , I mean, what do you think about that?
Because at the end of the day are we not responsible for ourselves?
I mean you don't have to take drugs!
But you're taking a, a, a G P's word  for it, that these tablets that he's given you are gonna help you through the emotional pain 
Mm.
that you are going through.
They done nothing for me  at all!
Mhm.
I had a phobia about going to the dentist, and the doctor wanted to give me tranquillizers  but I didn't want to take them, so I actually went for hypnotherapy which helped.
Yeah.
In the past we had a lot more  family structure and friends, a good neighbourhood network, but if you had problems  er, you could go, you could talk about it 
Yeah.
you could  get it out of your system.
But now women are meant to go along  on an even keel  and when something upsets them  they think tha e , I shouldn't be able to express this any more, so I'll go to the G P and he'll give me something and then the emotions will go away, but unfortunately they don't go away, they just go wandering, they'll come back again at another point.
I think there's something that we haven't discussed, and that's that, doctors don't seem to prescribe tranquillizers to men, it's women, and they do wrongly prescribe them to women.
Is that true?
No.
No.
In my experience it is.
Maybe men talk about it even less than women do.
I mean do do yo , do you think women take more drugs than men do, whether recreationally or or or fo for their health or  now th , is th is there a particular problem that women have with drugs whether it's illegal drugs or tranquillizers?
Yes?
Do men, not perhaps drink alcohol more than women?
Aha.
And women use the tranquillizers as the alternative?
I don't know!
Well I , no one 's saying much about alcohol!
Yes?


In a study which I did, er erm I find that 
Aha.
erm  women were being prescribed tranquillizers about three times as often as men  and in fact, women go to see the G P three times as often as men.
Mhm.
So, I think the two things go together that way.
Well let me ask you this question, would you say that using drugs has improved your life?
Eighty one people here say they've taken drugs, and probably more than that, has using drugs, any kind of drug improved your life?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And who knows what they're talking about, those fifty two people who said yes.
What about the contraceptive pill, that brings a lot of joy?
 
Di we In ,in , indirectly there!
 
A final question, do think society could do without drugs?
Do you think, do you think we could ever do without drugs?
Button one for yes, and button two for no.
And I think you're probably quite right you eighty three!
Seventeen people have said yes, we could do, where are you you idealists?
What are all the asthma sufferers, and arthritis sufferers, and various people going to do?
Yes?
I don't think we could be completely drug-free, I mean obviously medical conditions dictate that you have to take medi , medicines 
Mm.
but, when it comes to taking other drugs, for a thrill, yes you could do without them, and one of the ways you can do that is by taking time out for yourself, whether you're a single parent or if you're a  you know, if you're a family, the important thing is finding time for yourself and not for your family or your dependants.
I think that deserves a whole programme.
How do women find time for themselves?
 
We'll talk about it another day.
Thank you all very much indeed!
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Goodbye.
