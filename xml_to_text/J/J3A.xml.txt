Dynamite fishing threatens Mekong ecosystem
Increased use of "dynamite fishing" methods in Cambodia have led to drastic reductions in fish catches for communities downstream, particularly in Laos, where catches have fallen by 50 per cent.
According to a spokesman from the Thai section of the Earth Island Institute, the growing use of such unsustainable fishing practices in Cambodia is disrupting the main spawning grounds of numerous fish species, and thus threatening the ecosystem of the Mekong Basin as a whole.
Dynamite fishing is illegal in Cambodia, but the lack of strong centralized authority in the country means that the law is impossible to enforce.

Gummer urges financial penalties for polluters
John Gummer, the UK Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has suggested that the European Community (EC) should have the power to suspend subsidy payments to farmers who pollute the environment.
Speaking after a meeting of EC agriculture ministers, he made clear, however, that not all his colleagues agreed on the need for stricter environmental regulations at a time when farmers were trying to adapt to reforms in the EC's common agriculture policy (CAP).
Under existing arrangements, individual governments can withhold subsidy payments under national support schemes but they do not have the power to do so under CAP schemes.
Environmental organizations have been calling for some time for the incorporation of environmental criteria into the various CAP support mechanisms.

First Northern forest conference
The first conference to discuss the destruction of Boreal (temperate zone) forests, held in Sweden, agreed to a statement condemning the consumer countries of Europe and North America for driving the devastation.
Over 100 environmental groups, representing interests as diverse as the World Wide Fund for Nature, Earth First, the Women's Environment Network and the (N. American) Algonquin Nation, agreed that present logging practises were wholly unsustainable, and that only a significant reduction in the consumption of pulp, paper and timber products would create conditions for a shift to sustainable forestry.

US may open parks to strip mining
The Bush Administration has announced plans which could result in large areas of protected lands being opened up to strip mining for coal.
At present, under a federal law passed in 1977, mining is prohibited in national parks and forests and on other protected lands.
Coal reserves estimated at 16 per cent of the nation's total are known to lie below such lands in 24 states.
The law does, however, exempt those who had a "valid, existing right" to the coal, although this was not clearly defined by Congress.
The Administration decided that it applied to any coal owner who had actively sought to mine the coal up to the day the law was passed.
In a subsequent series of court cases, however, federal judges ruled that this definition was inadequate.
Even if no mining had been carried out, the courts decided, the owners of the mineral rights still had a valid claim to the coal, and in seeking to deny them this, the government was violating the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits it from taking property without just compensation.
A proposed Interior Department regulation, to go into effect shortly after the presidential election, effectively takes on board the recent court rulings, and provides for compensation payments to all coal owners affected.
According to both the coal industry and the National Wildlife Federation, the government will as a result be forced to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars if it is to prevent strip-mining on protected lands.
If it fails to do so, mining is likely to proceed.

Coastal protection plan launched
England's 10,000 km coastline is threatened by a combination of over-exploitation, erosion and inadequate management, according to English Nature, the government's nature conservation adviser.
It has published the reports of three task groups aimed at addressing the problem.
The coastal group warned that "the combination of rigid sea walls now hemming in most of our low-lying or erodible coast, and land reclamation, is causing severe" coastal squeeze "" , which had resulted in the loss of some of the country's most valuable coastal features, notably salt-marshes.
It argued for a policy of "managed retreat" , using natural rather than man-made defences, with nature conservation brought into the heart of shoreline defence policy.
The estuary group reported that the country's 80 coastal estuaries and the wildlife which depends on them, particularly wading birds, had suffered from a lack of overall management.
English Nature is planning to draw up management plans for 80 per cent of the country's estuary areas by the end of the decade, starting with the Mersey, Humber and Exe.
The marine group called for the creation of a national network of protected marine sites, in response to a present lack of adequate statutory protection for habitats and species below the low water mark.
It identified 500,000 hectares of costal habitat which it said were in need of active conservation measures.
The EC's Habitat Directive specifically calls for internationally-important sites below sea level to be protected.
The seas around the British Isles are the most ecologically-valuable of any European Atlantic country, including cup corals, sea fans and a range of species-rich sediments and rocky areas, all of which are inadequately protected.
Sediments providing essential food for fish are vulnerable to damage by heavy trawling gear.
The group calls for a system of zoning to be drawn up in collaboration with the fishing industry.

Bush supports loosening of Endangered Species Act
President Bush has warned that he will not sign an extension of the Endangered Species Act unless it is amended to take local employment priorities into account, "because people and their jobs deserve protection too" .
The Act is due to be "re-authorised" later this year, although it will remain in force in any case until 1993.
Bush made the statement while campaigning in the Pacific North-West USA, where the Act has become the focus for resentment among logging workers, who fear it will cost them their jobs.
It has been used to halt logging activity in the country's few remaining old-growth forests, on the grounds that they constitute an essential habitat for species listed in the Act, notably the northern spotted owl [see EDs 52; 57; 59/60].
In his speech, Bush asserted that "it is time to make people more important than owls" .
Environmentalists, supported to some extent by Bush's Democrat opponent, Bill Clinton, countered that the logging industry had no long-term future due to the rapid depletion of the forests.
They blamed the job losses on automation of the timber industry and increasing exports of raw, unprocessed logs.

Anthrax attacks Namibian elephants
Namibia's rare desert-adapted elephants are under threat from anthrax.
In an effort to protect them from the disease, Namibian nature conservation officials have resorted to vaccinating the animals with darts fired from helicopters.
The operation appears to have been successful, and none of the vaccinated elephants has shown any symptoms of the disease.
A spokesman for the World Wide Fund for Nature, which supported the operation, said: "Saving the desert-dwelling elephants of Namibia is a high priority because they are so uniqueâ€¦
They have adapted their behaviour to survive in the arid and semi-arid conditions of northwest Namibia."

Laos fishermen to help dolphins
A group of Irrawaddy dolphins, which appeared for the first time in Laos last year, are in danger of dying out as a result of the increasing use of gill nets by local fishermen.
The animals suffocate after being trapped in the nets, and the fishermen are reluctant to cut them free due to the high cost (US$20) of replacing the nets.
In response, the Laotian government, with the support of a number of environmental organizations, has set up a fund by which fishermen will be able to claim compensation for nets destroyed to free dolphins.
Many Laotians hold dolphins in high regard, believing them to be reincarnated people.
There are many accounts of dolphins rescuing people in danger of drowning or being attacked by crocodiles.

Flamingos go wild in Germany
A colony of wild flamingos has become established in northwest Germany, but the origin of the birds is a mystery.
Six Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) appeared at the Zwillbrocker Venn nature reserve in 1982, and the birds have since reappeared, in growing numbers, each year.
This summer, a flock of 31 birds (including some European flamingos â€” Phoenicopterus ruber rosus) successfully raised four chicks at the site, thereby allowing it to be designated as the world's most northerly wild flamingo colony.
The original birds are believed to be escapees from captivity, probably from a private collector who omitted to clip their feathers to prevent them flying away.
As yet, no owner has claimed them.

Pollarding to be reintroduced to save beeches
Medieval techniques of pollarding and woodland grazing are to be reintroduced in an effort to combat the decline of a group of 400 year-old beeches at Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire.
Many of the trees have died in recent decades, apparently as a result of the abandonment of traditional pollarding and grazing practices.
According to Burnham Beeches superintendent Ian Turney: "Since grazing was stopped, young trees have grown up between the pollards, competing for light, water and nutrients.
And because pollarding has not been carried out, tall, heavy shoots are growing up from the ancient trunks, which are usually rotten and hollow inside, and these too often either split or simply collapse".
Pollarding, which involves repeated cutting of branches at head height, and was originally practised mainly for firewood, is to be reintroduced, along with experimental grazing of ponies, pigs and cattle.
Both practises were once essential parts of the medieval commons economy.

World Bank report promises environmental awareness
In its latest annual report, the World Bank promises that environmental considerations will feature strongly in new projects.
The report follows a period of growing self-criticism of the environmental consequences of previous Bank decisions, notably in the recent World Development Report [see ED 59/60].
In the annual report, the Bank states that: "Without adequate environmental protection, development will be undermined; without development, environmental protection will fail." 
The aim is to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account at every stage of a project.
The Bank is also considering introducing environmental safeguards into its controversial structural adjustment programmes (blamed by environmentalists for forcing third world countries to despoil their environmental heritage in the quest for Northern-style economic prosperity).
A Bank spokesman claims that "not much is known about the relationship between macroeconomic measures and environmental impact." 
* An internal document prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department lists 35 per cent of Bank projects as "unsuccessful" .
The document, which was leaked to The Ecologist magazine, also states that the proportion of failures has multiplied by two and a half times over the last 10 years.
Ecologist editor Nicholas Hildyard commented: "We have long known that World Bank projects bring environmental catastrophe and suffering on a grand scale.
Now we know the projects are economic failures as well.
This removes the last shred of justification for the World Bank's very existence."

Companies named for attacking American tribal lands
Survival International, in co-operation with Minewatch, has published details of activities by some of the world's major industrial companies which it claims are responsible for causing serious damage to the traditional lands of tribal people in the Americas.
Its report focuses on 10 organizations whose activities have drawn opposition from native American groups: Rio Tinto Zinc's Kennecott subsidiary is accused of infringing land rights of the Chippewa Indians in constructing the Flambeau Copper Mine in Wisconsin.
RTZ's Tinto Holdings Canada Ltd subsidiary has a controlling interest in a company which mines uranium at Elliot Lake, Ontario, which has been blamed for destroying the fishing-based economy of the local Anishnabe Indians.
RTZ are also criticized over tentative plans to open a huge copper mine in the heartland of the Guaymi people in Panama.
RTZ has denied the accusations.
Hanson's Peabody subsidiary is criticized for the effects of its coal mining activities on Navajo land in Arizona.
Despite an agreement between Peabody and the Navajo Tribal Council, pollution from the mines has been blamed for contaminating local water supplies, and forcing Indians to leave their homes.
Newmont Gold has been accused of "invading" the land of the Western Shoshone Indians in Nevada to carry out gold mining.
The tribe's National Council has expressed strong opposition to the activity, and in particular to the cyanide heap-leaching process used at the mine.
Newmont has denied the allegations.
Maxus of the USA is building a road and oil pipeline into Waorani Indian land in Ecuador [see ED 61].
Settlement activity is likely to follow.
Daishowa of Japan has a logging concession on the land of Lubicon Cree Indians in northern Alberta.
It has refused the Cree's request for an undertaking not to commence logging until their outstanding land claim has been settled.
The Air Forces of the UK, Netherlands and Germany are criticized for continuing low-level flying exercises over the lands of the Innu people on the Labrador-Quebec peninsula.
The flights have been blamed for disturbing the game on which the Innu depend, and there are reports that pregnant women have miscarried as a result of the noise.
Energy Fuels Nuclear of the USA is mining uranium on the pre-eminent sacred site of the Havasupai tribe: Red Butte near the Grand Canyon in Arizona.
The tribe fear that tailings from the mine may contaminate local waterways.
Shell is developing natural gas fields in the Camisea River area of south-eastern Peru, on the lands of the Machguenga Indians, who are negotiating with the company in an effort to ensure that their rights and environment are respected.
The development is adjacent to the lands of the Kugapakori Indians, most of whom are uncontacted and therefore vulnerable to disease brought in by project workers.
Through its 50 per cent stake in the El Cerrejon open cast coal mine in northern Colombia, Exxon has been accused of acquiescing in the pollution of the Wayuu people's lands, resulting in some communities being uprooted.
In addition, its oil exploration activities in the Ecuadorian Amazon has been blamed for damaging the hunting economy of the Waorani, Quichua, Siona, Secoya and Cofan Indians, by driving away wildlife and polluting soil and water.
Its operations in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, have allegedly had a devastating effect on the caribou herds hunted by indigenous peoples in the area.
The German mining company Uranerz operates the Key Lake uranium mine in Saskatchewan, believed to be the world's largest, which has provoked expressions of concern from local Dene and Cree people, who fear possible radioactive contamination of their land.

Market mechanisms at heart of UK's environment strategy
The British government has made market mechanisms a central theme of its strategy to improve environmental performance.
This emerged as the main point of its second annual progress report on environmental policy, following the publication of the 1990 White Paper, This Common Inheritance.
Environment Secretary, Michael Howard, laid out a broad range of economic options, including tradeable pollution emissions, carbon taxes, road pricing and higher fuel prices.
An in-depth study on the implications of road pricing is expected to be published in 1994.
Any progress on carbon taxes, however, would depend on EC-wide agreement, and its eventual structure would in any case be strongly influenced by the Treasury.
On pollution permits, Howard favoured imposing limits on total emissions of gases by power generating companies, while fees would also be levied on discharges of waste into watercourses, and on abstraction from rivers and groundwater sources.
In both cases, the charges would be on a sliding scale, with environmentally-damaging practises attracting penal rates.
On waste, the government intends to introduce a system of credits designed to ensure that local authorities get on target to meet the goal of 25 per cent recycling of household waste by 2000.
Under one proposal, householders may be charged for the removal of non-recyclable rubbish, while separated consignments of glass, paper, and cans would be collected free.
The government is also considering increasing the cost of landfill disposal as a further means of encouraging recycling.
In other areas, the report committed the government to introduce tighter air quality standards for low-level ozone, benzene and carbon monoxide by 1993, and for other exhaust gases, together with sulphur dioxide, the following year.
Water quality standards for rivers and estuaries are to be tightened gradually from 1993 onwards.
The report also outlined areas in which implementation of the White Paper had been delayed, including the publication of strategic reviews of nuclear and renewable energy, both of which had been postponed, and the failure of many local authorities to publish plans for achieving the 25 per cent recycling target.
The report drew little enthusiasm from environmental groups.
Greenpeace's Executive Director, Michael Melchett, described it as "deeply depressing" , adding that "the only hope for the environment in this country rests with action by the European Community and other international regulators" .
Fiona Reynolds, Director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, warned that unless the government changed its economic priorities, "the effectiveness of economic instruments can only be marginal â€” like fiddling while Rome burns" .
* In a separate development, the government has announced plans to launch a three-year programme to help small- and medium-sized businesses improve their environmental performance.

World Energy Congress endorses green view
It is possible for the world to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions and still enjoy considerable economic growth, according to the fifteenth World Energy Congress, the gathering of the world's energy-generating industry.
In a dramatic departure from its previous orthodox stance on environmental matters, the congress endorsed a report by energy experts from more than 50 countries.
The report projects what it calls the "ecologically driven" case, under which worldwide economic growth would rise by 3.3 per cent per year while carbon dioxide emissions remained virtually stable.
The current trend towards ever higher emissions would be curbed by energy conservation (accounting for around 43 per cent of the required reduction) and a shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy (accounting for the remaining 57 per cent).
The report admits that "there has probably been a persistent tendency within the world's energy industry to understate the technical potential for improvement and substitution" .
It stresses that "it is often cheaper to invest in energy conservation than in additional energy supply" .
It concludes that the reorientation will require strong public support for energy efficiency, appropriate action, a willingness and ability to introduce new technology on a wide scale, and a widening empathy with environmental concerns.

Thailand launches conservation campaign
In an effort to prevent widespread electricity blackouts, the Thai government has set up an ambitious energy conservation programme.
Largely because of the high economic growth rate in Southeast Asian countries, electricity demand is far outstripping demand throughout the region.
This has led to blackouts in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines, for instance.
The Thai plan is based on calculations which show that it is cheaper to improve the electricity efficiency than to build new power stations.
The measures include an energy conservation fund encouraging consumers to buy household goods (ranging from refrigerators to light bulbs) which are energy-efficient.
The fund will be financed by a tax on oil and oil products, which is expected to raise US$55 million per year.
Another set of measures aims to encourage generating companies to produce electricity at the lowest economic and environmental cost (for instance by revising tariff systems and campaigning for energy saving).
The latter are partly funded by the World Bank's Global Environment Fund.
Specialists from the International Institute for Energy Conservation working with the government claim that the Thai programme provides a blueprint for similar measures in other developing countries.

UK Green Party conference
The recent decline in the fortunes of the UK Green Party was epitomized in the eyes of many observers by the deep divisions which emerged at its annual conference, held in Wolverhampton in mid-September, where organizational reforms approved last year were overturned.
After gaining 15.8 per cent of the national vote in the 1989 European elections, and achieving a membership high of approximately 18,500 the following year, the party has declined to around 6,500 members.
In the 1992 general election, it gained just 1.3 per cent of the vote.
The key issue of debate at the conference were the "Green 2000" reforms, designed to give the party a more organized and professional structure.
They were approved at the party's 1991 conference [see ED 51].
One of the leading advocates of Green 2000, Sara Parkin, subsequently became chair of the party's executive.
The reforms were, however, strongly opposed by a section of the Green Party, which in broad terms viewed them as a betrayal of the movement's roots and as a "sell-out" to mainstream political methods.
In the face of this opposition, Parkin resigned as chair of the party's executive, together with four of its seven remaining members.
At the 1992 conference, motions reversing the "Green 2000" reforms were passed.
An attempt to have Parkin suspended from the party was unsuccessful.
Parkin criticized her opponents as "anarchists" , and said that "the Green Party has become a handicap for Green politics" .
Unless it changed radically, she warned, "it was finished as a political force" .

The number of children contracting thyroid cancer in Belorussia has increased considerably since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 in neighbouring Ukraine.

In the most contaminated region (in the southeast near the Ukrainian border) the incidence in 1991 and early 1992 was 80 cases per million children per year.
The world average is one case per million.
The study linked the increase directly to the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl.
According to Vasily Kazakov, who led the study, the youngest children affected were contaminated in 1986 even before they were born, when their thyroid glands were already sufficiently developed to absorb radioactive iodine.
The results of the study have been verified by experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and independent doctors.

But during the winter, when temperatures in Ukraine regularly drop to -25C, the two reactors of the complex currently under repair would be the only source of heat on the site, he said.
There are plans to commission three new nuclear plants elsewhere in Ukraine to replace Chernobyl.
They would be the pressurized water reactors (PWRs).
At present there is a moratorium on the construction of nuclear plants, and the plans would need parliamentary approval.

Russia and Ukraine repeat call for Western help
Speaking on the eve of an international conference in London, the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian nuclear-power companies expressed their exasperation with the lack of financial help from Western countries to improve the safety of their nuclear facilities.
"If Western governments will stop just talking and will give real assistance, then we will not reject that help, because it will enable us to solve the safety matters more quickly.
But if the help is always delayed, we have the capacity to provide the necessary level of safety for our nuclear stations ourselves", noted Erik Pozdyshev, head of Rosatomenergo, the Russian nuclear-power company.
Pozdyshev also reaffirmed that Russia plans to keep its Chernobyl-type reactors in operation until well into the next century "after making the necessary safety changes" .
There are also plans in both countries to commission new, more modern pressurized water reactors (PWRs).

Row over Japanese plutonium ship escalates
Despite growing international criticism, the Japanese government is pressing ahead with its plans to ship highly radioactive plutonium from France and Britain to Japan to supply its nuclear-power industry.
It was reported in August that a ship had left for France to collect a first consignment [see ED 62].
At the time the Indonesian and South African governments banned the plutonium shipments from their territorial waters on safety grounds, and other countries in Latin America and the Pacific have made similar announcements or expressed serious concern.
The route of the first shipment--expected sometime this later year--is being kept secret for security reasons, but the government has said that it will try to avoid territorial waters.
The development of a domestic nuclear industry is highly controversial in Japan, and the international outcry has strengthened public opposition as well as, according to press reports, doubts within the government.

Sellafield nuclear dump delay
An application for the construction of Britain's first underground waste repository for low-level and intermediate nuclear waste is unlikely to be made before 1998, Nirex, the nuclear waste disposal company, has announced.
The delay stems from Nirex's decision to build an underground research laboratory to test geological conditions at the proposed site, Sellafield in Cumbria.
In June the company admitted that initial results from boreholes drilled in the area showed that its knowledge of conditions was "not sufficiently firm" .
If permission is granted for the laboratory, then it would take another two to three years to construct, gather data and analyse the results.
Nirex had originally planned to apply for planning permission for the repository--strongly opposed by environmental organizations--this year, with 2005 as the target date for its opening.
This timetable has now slipped by six to seven years.

Reactor shutdowns in Britain, Sweden, Lithuania, Bulgaria
The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in northwest England has been shut down after a leak of six gallons of plutonium inside a sealed unit where liquid plutonium is evaporated to form a solid oxide for storage.
According to British Nuclear Fuels, the leak was caused by an "engineering fault" and no radioactive material escaped into other working areas or the environment.
The clean-up operation is likely to take around five weeks.
The Swedish nuclear safety board has closed down five elderly boiling-water nuclear reactors on safety grounds [see also ED 59-60].
In all five, inspections had uncovered fissures in the cooling systems, requiring emergency repairs which were expected to take about three weeks.
Four of the reactors are part of the BarsebÃ¤ck and Oskarshamn complexes, owned by Sydkraft, and the fifth is at the Ringhals plant.
The Lithuanian authorities have closed down the nuclear reactor at Ignalina because of a unspecified fault.
They stressed, however, that there had been no radiation leak at the plant, which is of the Chernobyl type.
There have been two fires in the troubled Kozloduy reactor in Bulgaria.
Both were caused by short circuits during testing prior to restarting the reactor, which was shut down in February [see ED 56 and 59-60].
The fires caused only minor damage, and according to an engineer at the plant there were no effects on the environment.
* Radioactivity up to 30,000 times above normal levels has been found in Bogdanovka, a health resort in central Russia.

Antarctic depletion worse than ever
Depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic has started earlier and is spreading faster than last year, according to US scientists.
Scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that ozone readings over the South Pole in mid September were 15 per cent lower than those taken a year earlier.
If this trend continues, the ozone hole this year will be the deepest ever.
The scientists attributed the deterioration in ozone levels to particles boosted into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions in 1991 and to the continued increase in worldwide emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting gases.

Ozone depletion reduces crop yields
Experiments conducted by a British scientist suggest that the increase in ultraviolet radiation caused by ozone depletion will have immediate and serious effects on the yields of some key food crops as well as on other plants.
In his experiments Nigel Paul of the Institute of Environmental and Biological Science at Lancaster University observed a wide variation between species.
Some, such as wheat, were resistant to increased ultraviolet radiation, but others, such as peas, barley and oil-seed rape suffered significant reductions in yields.
In the most sensitive cases yields were reduced by 1 per cent for every 1 per cent cut in the ozone layer.
Among other vegetation, coniferous and beech trees appeared most seriously affected by increased radiation.
Ultraviolet radiation damages DNA in plants.
Plants may come into leaf earlier (leading to frost damage), grow more slowly, have more branches and smaller leaves, produce fewer flowers, or have lower oil and protein contents.
The ozone layer over Europe has already been reduced by 10 per cent in the last ten years, and is expected to decline at an accelerating rate.
Concern about ozone depletion has until now centred on its effects on humans, for instance through increased skin cancers.
The economic consequences for food crops and other plants of the resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation have received less attention.

Mystery ozone cloud perplexes scientists
Huge clouds of low-level ozone have formed over central Brazil and the Atlantic, apparently as a result of burning forest and savannah grasslands.
The burning releases nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, which react with sunlight to form ozone.
High levels of the gas at low-level have been shown to threaten the health of plants, animals and humans.
Researchers from NASA and the Brazilian space agency, INPE, are attempting to measure the density and drift of the clouds.
An INPE spokesman blamed annual forest burnings in the centre-west of Brazil.
"As the ozone has formed over a largely uninhabited region, it seems there is no immediate danger.
But it is the first time that we have seen such a phenomenon on a large scale.
It is such a strong signal that it is necessary for us to know more about it."

New treaty on sea dumping
Thirteen European countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean have signed a new Convention on Marine Pollution, known in short as the Paris Convention.
It replaces a more general treaty adopted in 1974.
The convention establishes the principle that nothing that is harmful to human health and marine life can be dumped at sea.
It commits all signatory states to (i) use the best available techniques for controlling pollution,(ii) reduce discharges of toxic waste to harmless levels by the year 2000, and (iii) refrain from all dumping of radioactive waste for a period of 15 years.
The issue of dumping radioactive waste overshadowed the final phase of the negotiations and nearly caused them to break down.
Eventually a compromise was adopted between the call championed by Scandinavian and other countries for a permanent ban, and France and Britain's insistence on their right to dump larger items such as nuclear components of submarines and power stations.
The two countries now have the right to dump such material after 2007, but they have undertaken to give serious consideration to finding land-based alternatives in the meantime and will only be able to dump after consultation with the other signatory states and in accordance with the "no-harm" principle.
Environmental groups deplored the failure of the convention to impose an absolute ban on the dumping of radioactive waste.
But Greenpeace noted that the British government's willingness to sign the convention as it stood was a fundamental shift in policy in that it had agreed for the first time to the elimination in principle of dangerous chemicals.

Water pollution figures for UK
The number of "major" incidents of water pollution declined by 41 per cent in 1991, from 658 to 386, according to figures contained in the second annual report by the National Rivers Authority (NRA).
The decline is due primarily to a fall in the incidence of farming-related pollution.
Sewage- and water-related sources accounted for a quarter of major incidents, followed by industry- and oil-related sources.
The total number of incidents increased to 22,469, a rise of 8 per cent on the previous year.
This was due to a higher number of reported sewage leakages.
Most of the incidents "caused little or no environmental harm" .
Some 356 prosecutions were brought in 1991 and convictions were secured in 347 cases.
The levels of fines showed a sharp rise, with the Â£200,000 the largest fine imposed.
The NRA attributed the downward trend in major incidents mainly to its tough and rigorous pollution prevention and control measures and the strong signals being sent by the courts through massive increases in the size of fines imposed on convicted offenders.

NRA proposals on water supply
The National Rivers Authority (NRA) has recommended a new scheme to the government for setting future targets for a cleaner water environment.
The scheme, if adopted, would allow the government to set "statutory water quality objectives" for all inland and coastal waters in England and Wales for the first time.
The scheme is in two parts.
The first would be used to set targets for improved river quality based on six "use" classes; fisheries ecosystem, abstraction for drinking supply, abstracting for agricultural and industrial use, water sports, commercial farming of fish and shellfish, and special ecosystem (i.e. specific areas for the purposes of nature conservation).
The second part of the scheme would provide a means of assessing the general state of the water environment at regular intervals.
This would be achieved by looking at the chemical, biological, nutrient and aesthetic states of water.
Recommending the scheme, the NRA's chief scientist, Jan Pentreath, said: "After much consultation, I believe that the right balance has now been achieved.
It is right that water should be improved locally on the basis of what it is to be used forâ€¦
At the same time, it is essential to have a national picture in order to assess that overall priorities and accountabilities are being addressed.
This requires looking at the environment through different "windows" , each of which gives a slightly different picture."

According to Ofwat, the water industry regulatory body, the "trials do not appear to have caused difficulties, with 91 per cent of householders saying they had no difficulty in affording metered water" .
But the National Consumer Council said the survey showed that"if people can afford to pay the bills generally then they are not going to save water.
The hardship of saving water will fall most on the poorest people.
It is much fairer to charge the same rate for water to everybody".

The British government has applied for a one-year exemption from European Community environmental legislation requiring all new cars to be fitted with catalytic converters from 1 January 1993.

For similar reasons other EC countries, including Belgium, France and Italy, have also requested a temporary exemption or are expected to do so.
The move has been criticized by environmental organizations, which argue that the cars could be fitted with a converter because the cost, around Â£300 per car, is not prohibitive and that in any case manufacturers have known for some time when the law would come into effect.
Several manufacturers who have equipped all their new cars with converters for some time also disapprove of the relaxation.

Deforestation leads to increases in disease
Parasitic insects carrying dangerous diseases thrive in the wake of deforestation, resulting in increased incidence of potentially-fatal illnesses such as malaria and river blindness.
Research carried out by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine suggests that various species of malarial mosquito thrive in the wake of forests being opened up.
In Brazil, for example, the Anopheles darlingi is able to exploit conditions such as pools of water created by the construction of settlements and road construction, opencast mining and eroded land, to breed in far greater numbers than normal, resulting in a population explosion.
In West Africa, the savannah-dwelling blackfly which transmits the worm causing river blindness has expanded southwards as forests are cleared in Liberia, Ghana and the CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
Opening up forest land to new migrants also has a double effect: the newcomers lack immunity to local strains of disease and suffer accordingly, while also importing diseases from outside to which the indigenous forest peoples are similarly vulnerable â€” as happened with malaria in the Brazilian Amazon.

Somali toxic waste dumping scandal
The head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Mostafa Tolba, claimed in early September that a Swiss and an Italian company were seeking to take advantage of the civil war in Somalia by dumping toxic waste in that country.
He said that the companies, subsequently identified from other sources as Acher Partners and Progresso, had signed an agreement to this effect with a representative of one of the warring factions.
Since the overthrow of Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991, Somalia has been riven by clan fighting and famine.
Central authority has collapsed, and 100,000 people have already died from the combined effects of the fighting and famine.
Under the contract, a copy of which was leaked to the media, Nur Elmy Osman, describing himself as "minister of state for health, Republic of Somalia" , granted Acher a 20-year concession to treat up to 550,000 tons a year of industrial and hospital waste, including "solid and liquid waste of the toxic type" , at a disposal facility in Somalia and to store the treated waste in a landfill.
The disclosure caused a furore in Italy, Switzerland and among Somalia's neighbours.
Both the Italian and Swiss authorities launched investigations into the allegations.
Acher claimed that it had merely arranged the contract on behalf of Progresso, but representatives of the latter denied involvement in illegal activities.
A Geneva-based consultancy hired by the United Nations to investigate the allegations subsequently reported that it had found no evidence that any hazardous waste had been exported to Somalia.
UN officials announced on Oct. 6 that the two companies had aborted their plan.
Commenting on the affair, Tolba said that it "should remind us that wherever there is human suffering there is someone ready to make a profit" .

The Environment Minister, SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal, has banned the importation of certain types of industrial waste from Australia.
After an authorized shipment of electric transformers arrived in France and was transported to a specialist factory in Saint-Vulbas for decontamination, the minister announced that no such shipments would be allowed in the future.
The decision was taken in response to a campaign by Greenpeace against the international trade in waste products and in the wake of a scandal involving the illegal importation of hospital waste from Germany [see ED 62].

France to mirror German recycling scheme
France is planning to set up a national system for recovering and recycling packaging waste similar to that being implemented in Germany [see ED 49/50; 56].
The government has adopted a decree laying down the legal framework for licensing companies to carry out recovery and treatment of packaging waste.
The first company to have received a licence is due to begin operations by the end of this year.
Initially around ten waste-sorting and treatment centres will be commissioned.

UK dumps "pollute SSSIs" 
Waste dumps are causing pollution in more than 30 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Britain, according to a survey published by Friends of the Earth.
The main problems highlighted by the survey are toxic waste seeping into watercourses and inadequate controls on refuse dumps.
Although some damage is caused by illegal flytipping, most of the pollution arises from licensed sites.

Computer recycling
Most computer companies are working on setting up a computer recycling scheme, according to IBM environmental operations director John Gillett.
Referring to IBM's own plans, Gillett said that details had not yet been worked out, but it was clear that additional plant capacity would be needed to reprocess computer parts.
In about 18 months IBM would be able to market a computer with a high content of recycled material, he said.
