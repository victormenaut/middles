Introduction
This Training Guide is a practical introduction to the basic features of Microsoft Word (‘Word’).
It has been written for use on microcomputers with the IBM PC or PS/2 style keyboards, including the RM Nimbus and the Amstrad PC .
Working the tasks
The same structure of instruction and exercise is maintained throughout the Guide .
The instructions for performing a task are enclosed in a large box in the upper of the two pages.
Words you are required to TYPE (eg Your Own Name ) or keys to be tapped (eg Enter ) are enclosed in boxes.
It is assumed that you are using version 5.0 of the program and that the original settings on the program disk are in force.
Getting Started
If the following method of getting into Word does not apply exactly to the way your machine is set up, use your manual.
If you are working on a network, check with your teacher/supervisor.
Starting Word
At step 2 below, choose the option that applies to your system:
1
Check the system prompt is onscreen (usually A> for a standalone machine or C> for a hard disk)
2
360K floppy disks : insert the Program disk 1 into drive A and a formatted document disk into drive B Larger capacity disks : insert the Word program disk created by Setup into drive A, and a formatted disk for documents into drive B Hard disk system : TYPE cd directoryname , ie the name of the directory containing the Word program; and then tap Enter 
3
TYPE word 
4
Tap Enter .
360K system : remove Program disk 1 and replace it with Program disk 2 when prompted
Setting up Word
After you have started Word and if you want to save files to a floppy disk in drive B:
1
Tap Esc ape,T ransfer,O ptions.
At the setup:prompt
2
TYPE drivename eg b:, for drive B
3
Tap Enter 
Quitting Word
1
SAVE your work (see Task 4)
2
Tap Esc for Escape
3
Tap Q for Quit.
If you have edited your work since last saving it the whole text becomes highlighted, and you will be prompted to Enter Y to save changes to document, N to lose changes, or Esc to cancel (the Quit command).
Choose the one you want.
The Screen
When Word is first loaded the screen looks like this.
The screen is divided into two areas: a large WINDOW, covering most of the screen (it has been shortened above), with a smaller COMMAND AREA beneath it.
The Line counter (Li) in the Status Line is optional.
To set it up see the appendix (page 75).
WINDOW
This is where text is typed in and edited.
The instructions in this Training Guide assume that the active cursor starts here.
The keystroke in the Command Area which selects the text editing window is Esc for Escape.
The text editing window is different from the Window command (not taught in this book).
The cursor is the point where text appears on the screen.
It moves to the right as text is typed and may increase in size in the selection (highlighting) of text for editing or for executing commands.
The diamond-shaped end mark (), initially contained within the cursor, marks the end of the document.
COMMAND AREA
When Word is first loaded, the cursor is located in the window.
To execute most commands it is necessary to move it into the Command Area as the first step in selecting a command.
While all the selection of text upon which commands may operate is done from within the window, only character and paragraph formatting commands, and ‘toggle’ commands (page 5), operate within it.
All other text editing and file commands are made with an active cursor in the Command Area.
The Command Menu shows the main branches of the command tree available.
The Message Line attempts to tell you what to do next, or what has gone wrong, or requests responses, at every stage of editing or using a command.
The Status Line gives additional information.
The cursor position indicators show the numbers of the page (Pg ), the line (Li ) and the column (Co ) the cursor is in.
It may also show the division number (D ) eg P1 D1 L1 C1 .
The Scrap is a temporary store for deleted text, eg before being moved.
The toggle keys status area shows when the various keyboard locks are switched on (see page 5).
The name of document area shows the name of the document onscreen only after it has been saved, and the unbroken border until then.
Accessing the Command Area
Tap Esc for Escape.
This highlights Copy , the first listed branch of the command tree.
It is selected when Escape is tapped when the cursor is in the window.
Moving around the Command Area
Tap the first letter of the command (eg Tap T for Transfer).
The active cursor enters that branch of the command tree.
You will be faced with one or more prompts , words followed by a colon, eg TRANSFER:which may not have responses already filled in.
Some prompts have two or more options, one of which is always chosen, as indicated by the round brackets which enclose it, eg in formatted:(Yes) No ,Yes is preselected.
Preselected options, or values which are already filled in, are called defaults.
They apply unless you deliberately choose a competing option or enter a different value.
(The preset margin, top: 1″, is an example of a default value.)
To move between prompts and branches of the Command Tree:use a combination of the arrowed direction keys() OR tap the Tab key to move left to right and back to the beginning again
To select options within a prompt:
Tap the Spacebar to move left to right and back to the beginning again
Prompts and options are on a ‘loop’: eg tapping the (Right ) direction key at the last prompt takes the cursor back to the first.
Cancelling commands and returning to the window
When a command has been executed, the cursor is automatically returned to the text editing window.
A command may also be cancelled at nearly every stage:
Tap Esc for Escape to return the cursor to the window.
(Exceptions: tap E for Exit to leave, HELP, GALLERY, PRINT PREVIEW and DOCUMENT-RETRIEVAL.)
To start another command tap Esc again.
Undoing commands and editing
Even if a command has already been executed it can often be undone.
Tap Esc for Escape, Tap U for Undo.
This also applies to editing changes made in the window.
See Task 11 for details.
Keyboard
The keyboard has the standard typewriter layout, but includes extra keys and symbols.
Some standard symbols are in different places.
If you are a touch-typist you will soon find out where.
There are extra Shift keys and a number of keys with arrows on them (but there are no Shift-Lock keys to produce upper case letters and symbols).
To avoid confusion between the different arrows the keys' names are used in the Guide instead of their symbols, except in the case of the four arrowed direction keys, where both are given.
If you have an older keyboard, keys illustrated below with initial capitals may be all in capitals.
The keys themselves may be different sizes.
Toggle keys
Tapping a toggle key once turns a feature on.
Tapping it again turns it off, rather like a light switch.
Indeed, the Number Lock ,Caps Lock and Scroll Lock keys will each have an indicator light if your keyboard is a recent one.
There are nearly a dozen keystrokes which operate toggles.
Some involve tapping one key, and the rest require one key to be held down while another is tapped.
When the toggle keys are switched on a two-letter code appears in the Status Line (see the screen on page 2).
EX
Extend highlight key,F6 , is on.
See Task 10.
Executing a command switches it off
NL
Number Lock is on
SL
Scroll Lock is on.
See Task 19
CL
Caps Lock is on.
Typing in letters gives capitals; but typing in numbers from the number row still gives figures, not symbols.
If Caps Lock is on and you hold down the shift key, lower case letters are typed
OT
Overtype key,F5 , is on
CS
Shift+F6 ,Column Select is on,see Task 23.
Deleting a column also switches it off
LD
Ctrl+F5 ,Line Draw is on.
You will be unable to type, except for drawing lines with the arrowed direction keys
If both NL and LD , or if both EX and CS , are switched on; only NL and EX respectively will show on the screen: both pairs of codes appear in the same places and NL and EX take priority if both are on.
In ordinary use the toggle keys should be kept switched off.
The Overtype ,Number Lock , and Line Draw functions are not needed for the whole book.
It is very easy to switch on toggles by accident, causing unexpected problems when typing in text.
The main culprits are the Overtype (F5),Caps Lock and Alt keys (ie Alt plus another key,see Task 13).
Should other two-letter codes appear, you will find it possible to continue typing.
To clear the codes see the list in the Appendix on page 75.
Cancelling toggle keys
Repeat the keystroke.
Function keys
The function keys, or ‘F’ keys, are found in the pad of 10 keys at the left of the keyboard or the row of 12 keys at the top of the keyboard.
Word is a powerful word processor and when the ‘F’ keys are used alone, or in combination with any of the shift keys (Ctrl ,Shift , or Alt ) extra commands are the result.
Some of these are basic commands taught later; some are short cuts; others are advanced commands.
All of them are potential sources of trouble for a beginner in Word.
Therefore:
DO try not to tap the function keys by themselves, or in combination with the Control, Shift or Alt keys, until you know what they will do
DO watch the screen while you type or give commands so that if something goes wrong you can correct it as soon as possible (eg using Esc ape,U ndo)
Presentation of keyboard commands
Many commands require the Ctrl ,Shift , or Alt keys to be held down while another key is tapped.
The command is usually stated in full, eg ‘hold down Alt and tap U for underlining.
Abbreviated it might appear as Alt+U .
A sequence of keystrokes is occasionally shown, for example, as Esc ape,T ransfer,S ave.
Tap the keys as indicated by the boxes rather than typing the letters: eg do not type the letters or the plus sign in Alt+U 
Help
Hold down Alt and tap H for Help, to get help information on screen.
For specific information about a command or a prompt or an option anywhere within that command:
1
Tap Esc for Escape (to select Copy)
2
Select the command or subcommand you want help with (see relevant Tasks and ‘Moving around the Command Area ’ on page 3 above)
3
Hold down Alt and tap H for Help
Cancelling help
Tap E for Exit.
The active cursor is returned to the text editing window.
Task 1
Objective
To type in text, watch wordwrap and make running corrections
Entering text
Type in text as you would on a typewriter, but at the ends of lines do not tap Enter .
Only tap Enter to start a new paragraph, after a heading, or to execute a command.
Running corrections
If you made an error with your last keystroke, tap the Backspace key once to delete it.
Type in the correct letter.
Other ways of correcting errors are shown in later tasks.
The Backspace key will not delete text if Overtype (F5) is switched on.
Memory jogger
Check that the Status Line is clear of two-letter codes, which indicate that toggle keys are switched on.
For example, if CL appears, the Caps Lock is on.
Tap Caps Lock once to switch it off.
If Overtype is on, tap F5 once to switch it off.
(See ‘Keyboard’ on page 5 for a list of codes.)
Text creation
1
TYPE Your Own Name to identify your printout
2
Tap Enter 3 times to leave 2 clear lines after your name
3
TYPE in the text of Task 1.
To start a new paragraph tap Enter twice.
This leaves one clear line space
4
Correct any errors you notice at once, but, for this task only, leave any others you may make
Amendments
Read through your work carefully.
Note any errors you have made but do not correct them.
SAVE your work under the filename:YourInitials1 (see Task 4) leaving no spaces or full stops between them; eg Jane Brown would type JB1 .
PRINT it (see Task 8).
Circle any typing errors you made on the printout.
Task 1
You are now entering text onto the screen using a word processor.
Watch how the cursor moves across the screen as you type.
Notice that when you get to the end of each line, Word starts a new line for you automatically.
It moves the word you are typing to a new line when it enters an invisible margin running down the right-hand side of the screen.
This feature is called wordwrap (or wraparound).
As well as saving you from having to break the flow of your typing by tapping ‘Enter’ it also leaves the text on the screen in a flexible or ‘unformatted’form.
This means you can change its layout in many different ways with great ease.
For example, you could double the width of the margins or reformat the text into several columns.
You may find it hard, at first, to remember not to tap the ‘Enter’ key so frequently, but it is an important habit to get into for later on when you will want to change the format of your documents.
Task 2
Objective
To insert text and delete characters
Inserting text
Move the cursor to the character space where the text is to be inserted.
Type in the missing character(s); or space(s) using the Spacebar .
Deleting characters
Move the cursor onto the character to be removed.
Tap the Del for Delete key once.
The character disappears from the window and reappears in the Scrap.
(Tasks 10 and 11 look at the selection and deletion of blocks of text.)
Memory joggers
Overtype:Word is set to insert text.
Check that OT (for Overtype) does not appear in the Status Line.
If it does appear there, tap the Overtype, F5 , key once to switch it off.
If you delete a character by mistake, move the cursor to where it was lost and type it in again.
Text creation
1
TYPE Your Own Name 
2
Tap Enter 3 times
3
TYPE in the text of Task 2
Amendments
1
First paragraph, third sentence: change ‘a character’ to ‘characters’(delete ‘a’and the space after it and type in an ‘s’at the end of ‘character’)
2
First paragraph, third sentence: change ‘typing it in’ to ‘typing them in’(delete ‘it’and insert ‘them’).
Leave one character space between ‘them’ and ‘in’
3
Second paragraph, first sentence: change ‘a key’ to ‘the keys’(delete ‘a’and insert ‘the’; add an ‘s’at the end of ‘key’)
4
Second paragraph, first sentence: change ‘hold it down’ to ‘hold them down’(delete ‘it and insert ‘them’)
5
Third paragraph, first sentence: change ‘The best keyboard has’ to ‘Some keyboards have’(delete ‘The best’and insert ‘Some’, add an ‘s’at the end of ‘keyboard’, delete the ‘s’at the end of ‘has’and insert ‘ve’in its place)
Read through your work carefully and correct any errors you find.
SAVE it under the filename YourInitials2 (see Task 4) and PRINT it (see Task 8).
Task 2
When you delete using Word, no gap is left where the wrong character(s) had been.
The text ‘closes up’ as if the error had never been made.
When you insert a character you don't have to make a space before typing it in.
If inserting pushes a word into the invisible right-hand margin, the wordwrap feature automatically moves it to the next line.
As well as getting used to tapping ‘Enter’ less often, you should try to get a feel for how hard to tap a key and how long to hold it down.
Unless you have to hold down one key (ie Shift, Ctrl or Alt) while you tap another, the general rule is to tap the keys lightly, as you would on an electronic typewriter.
The best keyboard has a ‘click-touch’.
You feel a soft click through your fingers before you have pressed a key as far as it will go.
The click means the word processor has typed that character onto the screen.
It helps you to build up speed and keeps your fingers from getting so tired, as well as prolonging the life of the keyboard.
Most of the keys on a word processor's keyboard are ‘repeater’ keys.
If you press a key and hold it down rather than just tapping it, you will type the same character again and again; or, if you are deleting text, you may delete more than you meant to — so keep your touch light.
Task 3
Objective
To join and split paragraphs
Joining paragraphs
Move the cursor onto the very first letter of the paragraph which is to be joined to the end of the paragraph above it.
Tap Backspace until they join (ie twice, if one line separates the paragraphs).
Insert spaces as necessary.
Splitting paragraphs
Move the cursor onto the first letter of the word which is to become the first letter of the new paragraph.
Tap Enter twice.
This leaves one clear line space between the paragraphs.
Inserting blank line spaces
1
Move the cursor to a blank line or on to the first character of the text to follow the blank lines
2
Tap Enter once for each additional line space required (there are 6 per inch)
Memory jogger
Check that the Status Line contains no two-letter codes (see page 5) so that eg Caps Lock (CL) and Overtype (OT) are both switched off.
Text creation
1
TYPE Your Own Name 
2
Tap Enter 3 times
3
TYPE in the text of Task 3.
Use the Caps Lock key to type ‘PROOFREADING’.
Immediately afterwards, tap Caps Lock again to switch it off
Amendments
1
Make ‘PROOFREADING’ a heading by starting a new paragraph at the ‘T’of ‘Throw away’
2
Start a new paragraph at ‘Proofreading means reading’
3
Start a new paragraph at ‘As a double-check’
4
Join the last 3 paragraphs together.
Make sure there are 2 character spaces between the sentences
5
In the newly created last paragraph start a new paragraph at the ‘M’ of ‘Mistakes do not’
Read through your work carefully and correct any errors you find.
SAVE it under the filename YourInitials3 (see Task 4) and PRINT it (see Task 8).
Task 3
PROOFREADING
Throw away your correcting fluid!
Using a word processor, all corrections are carried out on the screen before a document is printed.
Proofreading means reading each word of your work carefully and also making sure the layout is right.
When you have typed in your work, move the cursor back to the very beginning and use it to guide your eyes by moving it down the screen at the left-hand margin as you check each line.
As a double-check you should read through a document after it has been printed, especially if it is going to be sent to an important customer.
Make sure your paragraphs have at least one clear line space between them and that there are consistently 1, 2 or 3 character spaces after a full stop, a question mark and an exclamation mark.
There should be one space after a comma, a semi-colon and a colon within the body of your work and one space between each word.
There should also be at least one clear line space above and below a shoulder heading.
Mistakes do not disappear of their own accord, and the text on the screen will be saved and printed exactly as it appears.
Make sure it is error-free by always proofreading your work.
Task 4
Objective
To save work, clear the screen and abandon work
Saving work
1
Tap Esc for Escape
2
Tap T for Transfer
3
Tap S for Save.
The cursor now lies next to the prompt TRANSFER SAVE filename:and the Message Line requests you to Enter filename 
4
TYPE in a filename using the rules of Task 4 below.
Check the format prompt selects (Word)
5
If it doesn't, tap the Down , key once and then tap the Spacebar until it does
6
Tap Enter .
In the Message Line:Saving …
JB4 tells you that Word is saving your file
7
When saving a file for the first time a SUMMARY INFORMATION menu may be displayed.
Ignore it
8
Tap Esc for Escape to finish saving.
(Tapping Enter will not always work.)
If the message:File already exists.
Enter Y to replace or Esc to cancel appears, the filename you have chosen belongs to another file, which you risk overwriting.
Tap N for No and use a different filename.
A file you overwrite is lost.
If the message Not a valid filename appears, your filename does not obey the rules.
Change it until it does.
The filename is displayed in the lower border of the window.
Clearing the screen
When a document has been saved it should be cleared from the screen before typing in a new document and not merely deleted (which introduces the danger of unknowingly overwriting the file just saved).
1
Tap Esc for Escape
2
Tap T for Transfer
3
Tap C for Clear
4
Tap W for Window.
If you have just saved the document, the screen will clear.
If you have edited the document since last saving it, the prompt:Enter Y to save changes to document, N to lose changes, or Esc to cancel appears in the Message Line

Amendments
1
Proofread and correct your work.
SAVE it under the filename YourInitials4 .
PRINT it (see Task 8)
2
Clear the screen.
Task 4
RULES FOR FILENAMES
Text saved by a word processor is put into a file which is kept separate from other documents.
A filename is the name given to such text to identify it to you and to Word.
When you save a document, Word asks you to enter a filename.
This filename should obey the following rules.
If it doesn't obey the first two rules, Word will not save it until it does:
1 A filename can be up to 8 characters long; 2 A filename may not contain spaces and most punctuation marks, except hyphens, round brackets and a few others; 3 A filename may be typed in using either lower or upper case letters; 4 Every file on the same disk must have a different filename; 5 Every file, wherever it is stored, should have a different filename.
If you know you will want to keep a document while you are typing it, save it when you pause for thought, and always when you leave your workstation.
Until your work is saved it could be lost by accident.
Task 5
Objective
To load (retrieve) files and rename them
Loading files
1
If there is a document onscreen you want to keep, SAVE it (see Task 4)
2
Tap Esc for Escape
3
Tap T for Transfer
4
Tap L for Load.
The prompt TRANSFER LOAD filename:appears in the Command Area
5
TYPE in the filename of the text to be loaded.
It is not necessary to type ‘.
doc’ to load a file which uses this extension.
The filename extension must be typed to load a file with any other extension
6
Tap Enter 
If the message:Enter Y to save changes to document, N to lose changes, or Esc to cancel appears, you have edited a file and not yet saved it again.
Tap Y for Yes to save it again.
If the message File does not exist.
Enter Y to create or Esc to cancel appears, the filename has not been used.
Renaming files
1
Load the file to be renamed
2
Tap Esc for Escape
3
Tap T for Transfer
4
Tap R for Rename.
The prompt TRANSFER RENAME filename:appears in the Command Area with the old filename which will be preceded by other ‘technical’ details, eg C: \ WORD \ or B: \ 
5
TYPE in the new filename on top of the old one regardless of any other details displayed
6
Tap Enter .
If the message Cannot rename file appears, you have chosen a filename which is already in use.
Follow steps 2 to 5 again, but using a different filename
Copying files
To copy a file, save it using a new filename.
Renaming it merely renames the original version.
Memory jogger
Caps Lock will only type letters in upper case.
For punctuation and symbols, use the Shift key.
Text creation
1
TYPE Your Own Name 
2
Tap Enter 3 times
3
TYPE in the text of Task 5
Amendments
1
Proofread your work and correct it if necessary
2
SAVE it under the filename Task5YourInitials (see Task 4).
The full filename:Task5YourInitials.doc , appears in the lower border of the window
3
Rename it YourInitials5 and clear the screen (see Task 4)
4
Load the file YourInitials5 and PRINT a copy (see Task 8).
Task 5
FILENAME EXTENSIONS
The full stop and the three letters which Word has added to your document filenames are called a filename extension.
When you name a document of your own, you can add your own filename extension to help you distinguish it from other types of files.
For example, you could use:.
ltr, for standard letters;.
dat, for datafiles of names and addresses and.
doc for general documents only.
You should work out what your needs are and compile a list of suitable filename extensions.
It helps if a filename extension reminds you of the type of file it represents; as ‘.
dat’ could do because it is very nearly ‘data’.
BACK-UP FILES
A back-up is a spare copy of a file.
When you type in a document, saving it from time to time, Word does not destroy the very last version that you saved but renames it as a back-up copy.
This has the same filename as the current version but with a different filename extension;.
BAK for back-up copy.
For example, the back-up of the file HOLIDAYS.DOC would have the filename HOLIDAYS.BAK.
This means that if you decide you don't like the changes in the new version (HOLIDAYS.DOC) you can load the old version (HOLIDAYS.BAK) and work from that instead.
However, only the last version is saved; any earlier versions are lost.
In other words, even if you have saved your document more than once, you will have two versions altogether, but no more; unless you save them under different filenames.
Task 6
Objective

Keep your manual log for use with the tasks which follow
5
View any.
BAK files you have created.
Write a ‘B’ beside the appropriate entries in your manual log if those files have a back-up copy.
Task 6
FILE MANAGEMENT
It is very easy to get into a muddle with your files, especially when you are busy or need to use several disks to store them.
If you have to use files created by someone else, finding out which file you want to retrieve can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, particularly if that person is out of the office.
One way to overcome this problem is to keep a neat manual log of all the files you have access to in a separate notebook which lists the following information:
date file created, author, filename, disk number, date and time revised, brief description.
You should make an entry in the manual log at the time a file is created or updated, because you will forget to do it later.
Some word processors have a detailed directory attached to the files created.
In this case the details can be entered here whenever a file is amended and a printout obtained at will.
Task 7
Objective
To delete files
Before deleting a file make sure that it is no longer required.
If there is any doubt do not delete it.
The file could be copied to another disk if space is a problem on the current working disk.
File deletion (using TRANSFER DELETE)cannot be undone.
You cannot delete the file which is on the screen.

2
SAVE it using the filename Task7YourInitials (see Task 4) and record its details in your manual log
3
PRINT a copy (see Task 8)
4
SAVE it again using the filename YourInitials7 .
View the directory to verify that the file has been saved under both filenames (see Task 6)
5
Try to delete the file YourInitials7.doc ; which should be onscreen.
The attempt will fail.
Note the message:Cannot delete file .
This shows you cannot delete the task onscreen
6
Delete the file Task7YourInitials.doc .
If you do not type in the full filename , then after tapping Y for Yes the message:File or directory does not exist will be displayed
7
Check the directory again to verify that the file Task7YourInitials.doc has now been deleted.
Task 7
If your system uses a hard disk it is reasonably safe from damage in its casing.
Floppy disks, however, are loose and need to be numbered and kept in good order.
They should be kept in a rigid container made for the purpose and stored in a secure place.
The only disks you should need to use regularly are working copies of master disks.
Back-up copies of working disks should be made frequently so that if a disk is accidentally damaged, not too much work is lost.
From time to time, you should delete unwanted entries from your manual log of files and the unwanted files themselves from working disks.
In a business, copies of letters printed and sent might be the first to go: you would have taken ‘hard’ copies of them already if needed for records.
In a hospital or a bank, where records have to be kept for a long time, the files would not be deleted routinely, but stored in archives until the expiry of the prescribed storage period.
Task 8
Objective
To print work
Printing active document
Ensure your printer is switched on and ready to print.
(We assume the correct printer driver has been loaded.)

Task 8
PRINTERS
The end product of your work as a word processor operator is the printout of the letter or document you have typed.
This is called ‘hard’ copy as opposed to the intangible ‘soft’copy on your screen.
The quality of the printout required by you or your company dictates the type of printer to use.
A letter-quality printer uses a ‘daisy-wheel’ printing element to produce documents which look as though they have been typed on an electronic typewriter.
It takes about a minute to print a full A4 page.
For draft work the dot matrix printer is popular.
It is cheaper and faster than a daisy-wheel printer.
The characters are formed from tiny dots of ink poked on to the paper.
Some printers combine both daisy-wheel and dot matrix printing elements in one machine.
The future of high-quality printing in businesses belongs to laser printers.
They print several times faster than dot matrix printers.
They are quiet and clean, fit on a desk top and will soon match the quality of print produced by typesetting.
As well as typed text, they can produce large headings and graphics.
Task 9
Objective
To operate fast cursor movements
Cursor movement
Cursor movement (or direction) keys are located in the number pad at the right of the keyboard (or in a cluster of direction keys to the left of the number pad) and in the function key pad (see page 6).
Memory joggers
The arrowed direction keys (respectively Left ,Right ,Up and Down ) move the cursor respectively left or right one character space, up or down one line.
In the Command Area they move the cursor between prompts and between branches of the Command tree.
Number Lock:must be switched off if cursor movement keys on the number pad are to be used (page 5).

Task 9
MOVING AROUND DOCUMENTS
There is quite a lot of skill in moving quickly around the documents you create.
Some people tend to use the arrowed direction keys too much and neglect the more powerful methods available, especially if they have not been trained to use a word processor.
Working in a busy office, people have little time to learn the best way and may just ‘get by’, using the first cursor movements they learned.
Sometimes it is difficult to do more because of an instruction manual which is hard to understand.
Just as it was important to get used to pressing ‘Enter’ less frequently, so it is also important to get into the habit of moving around a document quickly and accurately.
The simple idea to follow is that the quickest way is the best way.
The ‘quickest way’ is the way which takes the fewest keystrokes.
So think about how you are moving around your documents and try to put the wide range of cursor movements to their best use.
While the exercises in this book are quite small and it is possible to get around using the simple cursor movements alone, you should practise using the faster ones because in longer documents you will need to be able to use all the short cuts you can.
Task 10
Objective
To select text for reformatting
Selection of text
Text to be moved, copied, deleted or otherwise reformatted must usually be selected (or highlighted) using the cursor.
The same keys are used to highlight text as to move around it, and the two functions should be used in combination.
Extending the selection
1
Move the cursor to one end of the block of text to be selected
2
Tap F6 (the Extend selection key) to anchor the cursor (' EX ' appears in the Status Line)
3
To extend the highlighting of text use the keystrokes listed above, listed in Task 9 and the arrowed direction keys (Note.
Shift+direction key(s) has a similar effect.)
Cancelling selection
Tap a cursor movement (direction) key.
The cursor will be returned to its original size and moved to a point just outside where the highlight had been depending on the key tapped.
To cancel the anchoring of the cursor by the Extend key tap F6 once.
' EX ‘disappears from the Status Line.
Memory jogger
The F7 ,F8 ,Shift+F7 ,Shift+F8 ,F9 and F10 keystrokes can also be used to move the cursor quickly (see Task 9).

Task 10
FIT FOR WORK?
Good health is a preoccupation of our age and much has been written the subject.
For those who work within the confines of an office, reducing the fatigue of a desk job is vital for one's general wellbeing.
Your brain needs oxygen and that means you should breathe plenty of fresh air.
Can you open the windows in your office?
Do you go out at lunch-time?
If you spend most of your working day sitting down, then you are urged to take up some form of exercise.
Evening classes for badminton or keep-fit are good fun and can lead to further social events.
Walking and swimming are activities which can be as gentle or as vigorous as you care to make them.
Many people have recently discovered the health club or gymnasium where machines are used to work and tone different parts of the body.
Do you always take the lift to the next floor or to the one above?
Try using the stairs for a change.
If you make it a habit, you'll soon find you are breathing evenly when you arrive and you won't feel the need to lie down in a darkened room to recover from your exertions!
Task 11
Objective
To delete blocks of text and undo editing changes
Text deletion
1
Select the text to be deleted (see Task 10)
2
Tap the Del for Delete key once only.
The text selected disappears from the window into the Scrap.
If you realise your deletion was a mistake before moving the cursor elsewhere, tap Ins for Insert to replace the text deleted.
If you realise it later you will have to undo the edit
Undoing
If an editing change or the execution of a command was a mistake, you can frequently ‘undo’ the error if you notice it in time; ie (generally) before you do any more editing, or give any more commands.
1
Tap Esc for Escape
2
Tap U for Undo.
If your edit was a deletion, this command inserts the text deleted from the Scrap into its original place in the document before deletion.
If undoing is unsuccessful, or if you preferred your document the way it was before undoing, Undo a second time.
This restores the document to the way it was before the first Undo command
Commands you cannot undo
Print, Options, Quit, and Transfer commands, except Transfer Merge (Task 31) cannot be undone.
They can only be cancelled before execution.
Special deletion
Select the text to be deleted, then hold down Shift and tap Del for Delete.
The Shift+Del command bypasses the Scrap.
Only use it to protect the contents of the Scrap while erasing.
It can be undone.

Task 11
A computer has several different kinds of memory.
One of these is the memory into which programs are read when you first load the system disk or a program disk.
It is called RAM and is the amount of memory people talk about when they say ‘it's a 640K computer’.
The computer ‘forgets’ whatever is stored in RAM when it is switched off; which is why it is so important to save to disk any files you have created beforehand.
A word processing program also has different types of memory.
Their purpose is to let you delete text safely or to move it around one document or between several.
In Word the simplest memory is the ‘scrap’— so called because it usually contains scraps of text.
It is the pair of braces (curly brackets) in the Status Line.
Whenever you delete highlighted text using the Del for Delete key, it disappears from the text editing window into the scrap.
It is on its way out, but it has not gone for good— yet.
The Undo command gives you a second chance when you delete a block of text in error by allowing you to replace it in the document exactly where it came from.
But do not wait before putting it back.
The scrap can only hold one item, the last block deleted, so put it back where it belongs before you delete anything else.

Task 12
HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE OFFICE
You might be fit for work, but is your office?
Offices can be refreshing, stimulating places to work, or they can add greatly to the tiredness you will feel at the end of a working day.
Colleagues apart, the surroundings are very important.
Here are a few items for a checklist.
Try scoring ‘2’ for good, ‘1’for average and ‘O’for poor and see how well your office does.
LIGHTING:
is there much glare on the screen of the machine you will be working at due to the room lighting or the light from the windows?
SCREEN:
are the characters crisp and easy to read, or are they too small, or blurred?
Does the screen flicker?
SEATING:
are there proper operators' chairs?
Can they be adjusted for height; do they have firm back supports?
TABLES:
is your terminal on a typist's table or a clerk's?
Does it give you enough leg room?
CABLING:
do the many cables from the computers and printers trail all over the place, or are they safely hidden inside trunking?
NOISE:
how quiet is the printer?
Are daisy-wheel printers shielded under acoustic hoods, or left to clatter away on desks every time someone prints a document?

Task 13
The professional presentation of a document depends on consistency of style throughout its length.
At work you are quite likely to have to follow a house style.
At home you are free to choose your own.
Whatever style you choose it should be followed consistently.
If you are unsure which style to use you may find the following conventions helpful.
The simplest style is to block all headings and text at the left-hand margin.
Any text inset from the margin should also be blocked.
If you block paragraphs at the left-hand margin, then headings may be either blocked or centred.
The same applies to hanging paragraphs.
If centring is to be used for main headings, then sub-headings may be either centred or blocked.
The complimentary close (Yours sincerely, etc) should always be blocked in a letter with blocked paragraphs.
It is unusual to use hanging paragraphs in letters.
If you indent paragraphs, all headings should be centred.
In a letter, the complimentary close starts at the centre of the page.
Task 14
Objective

Task 15
Objective
To combine character and paragraph reformatting
Combining formats
Character reformatting can be combined with paragraph reformatting to give more elaborate effects.
It is easier to combine formats after typing in text than before.
…
After typing
1
Highlight the text to be reformatted (see Task 10)

2
Hold down Alt and tap P to cancel the paragraph reformatting
If you have included two types of character reformatting, clearing one type will also clear the other.
For example, if you have boldface letters in italics, attempting to clear the emboldening (Alt+Spacebar ) will also clear the italics.
Similarly, clearing one type of paragraph reformatting (Alt+P ) will clear any other type of paragraph reformatting you have used.
For example, a centred heading above justified text would become blocked at the left-hand margin if Alt+P was applied to it as well as to the text below.

Task 15
THE DATA PROTECTION ACT 1984
This Act aims to make public and thereby to control the use of personal data held on all types of computerised equipment.
It also covers data held manually which can be identified using a code held on a computer.
Firms or individuals holding such personal data on living people are required to register with the Data Protection Registrar unless the information they hold is only involved in preparing the text of documents.
This will tend to exempt users of word processors from registration, but not users of databases containing more than names and addresses.
The Act gives people the chance to view files held on them and to correct any false information they may contain; excluding files held for a wide class of reasons under the heading of ‘security’.
Free booklets on the Act are available from the Office of the Data Protection Registrar, Springfield House, Water Lane, WILMSLOW, Cheshire, SK9 5AX.
Task 16
Objective
To display the ruler line
Ruler line
The ruler line shows the length of the typing line, and also the positions of tabs, indents and the break mark (eg see Task 26); but only for the paragraph the cursor is in.
It is similar to the scale bar on a typewriter, except that it does not indicate the widths of the margins on each side of the typing line.

 5 
Tap Enter .
The ruler line will now be visible at the top of the window whenever Word is loaded.
You should keep it switched on.
It looks like this:
The square brackets ‘[’ and ‘]’, show the ends of the typing line.
The ruler line counts characters in 10s however many characters per inch your printer can produce.
In other words, the 1, 2, 3…points on the screen only correspond with 1″, 2″, 3″…on the printed page when 10 pitch (pica) characters are to be printed.
Default margin settings
The left and right margins are preset at 1.25″ each for a page 8.5″ wide.
This gives a typing line of 6″ in 10 pitch,(or 60 characters).
The length and position of the typing line is stated indirectly: by subtracting the sizes of the margins from the width of the page.
Because the position the typing line will have on the printed page does not appear onscreen, it is vital to check the sizes of your margins to make sure you get the placing you require; for instance, to line up with a letterhead (see Task 18).

Task 16
FAX (FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION)
Fax is a well-established form of electronic mail whereby any document, whether it contains handwriting, graphics or photographs, can be transmitted over the telephone lines to any compatible receiver.
To transmit, the sender dials the number of the receiver, to make sure it is ready to receive the document, and simply feeds the original into the machine.
The copy, or facsimile, emerges on the receiver's fax machine, anywhere in the world.
The speed of transmission varies from 6 minutes down to a matter of seconds per A4 page, depending on the type of fax machine used.
There are over a million fax users in the UK, and British Telecom has published a directory of UK users.
Anyone who does not possess a fax machine of their own can use their local printer or British Telecom's Bureaufax service which is run from offices up and down the country.
Task 17
Objective
To format the page to A4
‘Default’ defined
A ‘default’ is the setting or choice you get unless you deliberately choose something else.
The default page measurements for a new copy of Word are:page length: 11″; page width:8.5n .
Your machine may already have been set up for the size of paper you are using.
To set up an A4 page, or to check whether a set up has been made:
Setting page measurements for A4

Task 17
JARGON
There are some unusual words used in word processing and computing.
Here are a few you may not have encountered.
USER-FRIENDLY:
computers or programs which are easy to use.
WIMPs:
windows, icons, menus and pointers — are different ways of making programs more user-friendly.
ICONS
are pictures representing computer functions.
A dustbin, for instance, might mean delete.
There is typically a row of icons onscreen instead of a menu of named functions.
POINTERS:
the arrow which appears on the screen when a mouse is used is called a pointer.
WYSIWYG (‘wisiwig’):
what you see is what you get — what you see on the screen should be printed looking exactly the same.
Task 18
Objective
To alter margins
Altering margins
It is generally easier to alter margins before you have typed in a document, especially if you will be setting tabs.

Task 18
ELECTRONIC MAIL
Sending documents by post can be slow.
Telephone lines are often engaged and call charges can be high.
Courier services are very expensive.
With computerisation, communicating with another office in the same building, or on the other side of the globe, has become much easier.
Telexes can be prepared during the day and sent out of office hours to benefit from cheaper call rates.
Desktop computers can be used as electronic mailboxes into which messages can be posted at a moment's notice for a correspondent to return to.
Security is maintained by passwords.
Automatic re-dialling facilities, which try again and again until clear line is available, have simplified many services, including transmission of facsimiles.
Some companies give such a high priority to the rapid and secure transmission of voice, data and documents that they have built private telecommunications networks in preference to using public systems.
Task 19
Objective
To type wide documents
Wide text
A wide document has a typing line broader than the window's width of nearly 80 characters.
Check that your printer can cope with wide text or condensed characters.
Type your document directly into the window, where you can see its full width all the time.
Reformat it to a typing line wider than the screen afterwards, unless it will include a complicated layout such as tab stops across its full width, when the page width and margins should be set beforehand.
1
Display the ruler line (see Task 16)
2
Tap Esc for Escape
3
Tap F for Format
4
Tap D for Division
5
Tap M for Margins
6
Tap the Down , key twice and the Right , key once each to select (page)width: 8.27 ″, assuming you have already set the page size to A4 (see Task 17)
7
TYPE the new page width, say 12.5 for 12.5″ in 10 pitch.
This gives a typing line of 10″ (page width 12.5″ minus left and right margins of 1.25″ each)
8
Tap Enter 
Horizontal scrolling
When sideways movement or typing in a wide document reaches the edge of the window the text scrolls horizontally in steps to reveal parts of the typing line which had been offscreen.
To view quickly:
Tap Right with the Scroll Lock ON to scroll right 1/3 Of a window at a time
Tap Left with the Scroll Lock ON to scroll left 1/3 Of a window at a time
The above keystrokes should be used to view a document's width generally.
They are better for this purpose than the Home and End keys because they work even when the typing line containing the cursor is very short.
The Home and End keys should be saved for the examination of single lines.

Task 19
In continental Europe it is quite common for people to speak not merely one foreign language, but two.
An English person who can speak even one other language fluently is rare.
Foreign companies complain about dealing with British companies whose sales literature is all in English and whose representatives speak only English.
Whilst the attention paid to foreign languages in this country is increasing, it is nothing like the importance of English abroad.
Half the world's scientific literature is printed in English.
English is the main language in computer technology, aviation, shipping and sport.
For an office worker in the UK this is not a reason for complacency, but a source of opportunity.
With English as one's own tongue, the addition of another language offers scope for more interesting and enjoyable work.
Task 20
Objective
To display and use the paragraph and new line formatting marks
Formatting marks
The invisible formatting marks contain instructions for the formatting of text, as does the division mark.
When visible, they make it easier to control the typing of text with complicated layouts, such as tables.
Displaying formatting marks

Tap Esc for Escape
2
Tap O for Options
3
Tap the Right key once and the Down key once to select:show non-printing symbols:(None) Partial All .
Tap P to select (Partial)
4
Tap Enter This command displays the paragraph mark and the new line mark.
They are never printed.
They will be displayed until a different option is chosen
Paragraph mark ()
The paragraph mark is typed at the end of a paragraph whenever you tap Enter It contains paragraph (not character) formatting instructions for the paragraph that precedes it, eg tab stops or justification.
New line mark ()
The new line mark is typed at the end of a line when you hold down Shift and tap Enter This keystroke is called tapping New line .
It starts a new line without ending one paragraph and starting a new one.
It is vital to tap New line at the ends of lines in tables.
(See Memory jogger also.)
Accidental deletion of a paragraph mark
Beware accidentally deleting the paragraph mark, especially when typing a table.
You will lose your tab stops and your table may collapse into a jumble of words!
If this happens tap Esc ape,U ndo at once.
The solution is always to tap New line and not Enter at the end of each line within the table.
Only tap Enter to end the table.
Memory jogger
It is useful to tap New line after sub-headings (eg after shoulder headings,see Task 20 below) and after short lines to be selected as a single block of text, eg a list (see Task 4), or the inside address of a letter.

Task 20
If you are thinking about buying a microcomputer have you really worked out what you want it for, or if you really need it?
If you have, it is wise to consider the following points before spending any money on computer equipment.
SOFTWARE
There should be a range of good software for the machine you are interested in.
In fact, since you buy a computer to solve problems, and not just to look good on a desk, the software available might be more important to you than the particular machine bought.
HARDWARE
The computer should have a large enough memory (RAM) for the programs you want to run on it, and operate fast enough for your needs and temperament.
EXPANDABILITY
Can you easily and comparatively cheaply upgrade the system as your needs grow?
For example, can you add on a hard disk, a high-resolution screen or a telex unit?
EASE OF USE
Is the computer and are the programs user-friendly?
If not, you will have to spend a lot more time and effort using them than is necessary.

Task 23
Amendments
Objective
To move columns
Column discipline
1
When you type columns of text you may wish to move, tap the Tab key once between each column and at the end of each line of the table.
It will then be possible to move any column as a block of text.
(If you tried to swap the last column of a table without doing so you would jumble up your text)

Task 24
Objective
To use fully blocked and inset paragraphs
Blocked and inset paragraphs
Blocked paragraphs are the default paragraph style.
Every line starts at the left-hand margin.
Inset paragraphs start some distance in from either or both margins.
They may be blocked, indented or hanging.
It is easier to inset after typing than before.
The instructions below describe insetting in steps of the default tab width of 0.5″.
To inset from the left margin or from both margins:
…
After typing
1
Select the paragraph(s) to be inset:
2
Left margin only:hold down Alt and tap N once for each step of 0.5″ (the default tab width)
Both margins:hold down Alt and tap Q once for each step of 0.5″ (the default tab width)
The degree of insetting of a paragraph is shown in the ruler line by the left square bracket ‘[’ being inset to the same extent
…
Before typing
1
Tap Enter at the end of the text which will precede the inset text.
Repeat step 2 above
2
TYPE in the text to be inset, tapping Enter at the end of each paragraph
Reducing and cancelling insetting
1
Select the appropriate paragraph(s)
2
Hold down Alt and tap M once for each 0.5″ reduction in insetting from the left margin
Other paragraph formats which may apply to the paragraph(s) will be unaffected.
If you hold down Alt and tap P for Plain paragraph format, then all paragraph formats will be cancelled (see Task 14).
To check how much a paragraph is inset move the cursor into that paragraph and look at the ruler line.
Memory joggers
The cursor must be within a paragraph for the ruler line to reveal its formatting (as far as it can).
New line , ie Shift+Enter starts a new line without starting a new paragraph.
Text creation
1
TYPE Your Own Name 
2
Tap Enter 3 times
3
TYPE in the text of Task 24, insetting the quotations 0.5″ from the left-hand margin and typing them line for line as shown below.
Tap New line at the ends of the first lines of the two-line quotes
Amendments
Proofread your work and correct any errors you find.
SAVE your work using the filename:YourInitials24 (see Task 4) and record its details in your manual log of files.
PRINT it (see Task 8).
Task 24
Some plays just ‘run and run’: Shakespeare's works for instance.
And they were written nearly 400 years ago!
Although frequently the butt of the jokes of modern comedians, his works are as powerful today to move and command respect as they were then.
Some fragments are known to nearly everyone, but not always who said them and in which play.
Can you identify these quotes?
‘O Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?’
‘But soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.’
Two easy ones to start with.
Now try:
‘To be, or not to be — that is the question;’
and:
‘Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.’
Finally:
‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.’
Task 25
Objective
To inset text (continued)
Insetting other distances
To inset text distances other than in steps of the default tab stops a more lengthy procedure is needed than shown in Task 24.
It is generally easier to inset text after you have typed in a document.
…
After typing
1
Highlight (select) the text to be inset from either one or from both margins (see Task 10)
2
Tap Esc for Escape
3
Tap F for Format
4
Tap P for Paragraph
5
Tap the Down key once to select left indent:
6
TYPE the size of the indent; eg. 75 for 0.75″ in 10 pitch.
To indent from:
7
The left margin only:tap Enter ; then tap a cursor (direction) key to cancel the highlight Both margins:tap the Right key twice to select right indent:
8
TYPE the right indent required; eg. 75 for 0.75″ (to give an even indent from both sides in this case)
9
Tap Enter — The highlighted text will be inset 0.75″ from both the left and right margins.
Square brackets in the ruler line indicate the new length of the typing line in the reformatted paragraph(s)
10
Tap a cursor (direction) key to cancel the highlight
…
Before typing
1
Follow steps 2–7 above to indent from the left margin; and steps 2–10 to indent from both margins
2
When you have finished typing the inset part of your document tap Enter to finish the paragraph
3
Hold down Alt and tap P for Plain paragraph format (see Task 14).
TYPE the rest of the document
Memory jogger
If you are typing in text with short lines, eg an address, use New line (Shift+Enter ) at the end of each line except the last, when you should tap Enter .
This text is now a complete paragraph and when using F9 or F10, all the short lines will become highlighted with one keystroke (see Task 10).
Text creation

Amendments
1
Give the task a heading ‘NETWORKS’
2
Highlight the second and third paragraphs and inset them 0.75″ from both margins
Proofread, correct, SAVE and log your work (filename:YourInitials25 ,see Task 4).
PRINT it (see Task 8).
Task 25
A network is a number of computers and/or other electronic devices connected by cable or by telecommunications via a telephone line.
Most networks are local area networks (or LANs).
They may cover a classroom or a whole building.
Individual workstations in the network can be used on different tasks at the same time and users benefit from sharing centrally held programs, datafiles and storage (memory) facilities.
A network is likely to include at least one printer and may be able to communicate with other networks or electronic devices located far away.
To avoid the chaos that would arise if, for example, several users wanted to print at the same time, the resources of a network may be controlled by ‘servers’.
Thus printing would be controlled by a print server; a file server would control loading and saving files.
Servers may be combined in one microcomputer dedicated to controlling these tasks alone.
If you are working in a classroom with a network, is there one workstation which the teacher uses at the start and end of the lesson, but which is otherwise unused?
This is probably the server.
Networks can be set up to send and receive text by electronic mail and telex (Task 18) or by facsimile transmission (Task 16).
More exotically, they can be used for voice conferencing or to gain access to mainframe computers.
This means you could sit at your workstation and ‘talk’ to a computer on the other side of the world.
For computers to ‘talk’ to each other when miles apart what they have to ‘say’has to be sent along a telephone line.
Unfortunately computers don't ‘talk’ in a way which the telephone system can understand.
Therefore translators, or ‘modems’, are connected to both of the computers to translate the signals at each end of the telephone line.
Task 26
Objective
To use indented and hanging paragraphs
…
Before typing
Since documents prepared with either indented or hanging paragraphs tend to be consistently of the one style, it is as easy to set up the format before typing as it is to do it afterwards.
Indented paragraphs
Hold down Alt and tap F for First line indent and TYPE in the text.
The first line only is indented 0.5″, ie the default tab width, from the left-hand margin (in 10 pitch).
The ruler line indicates the first line indent by a break mark,'I ‘, at the 0.5″ point.
Hanging paragraphs
Hold down Alt and tap T once only and TYPE in the text.
The first line only starts at the left-hand margin.
Subsequent lines are indented 0.5″ (the default tab width).
(Word calls hanging paragraphs ‘hanging indents’).
The ruler line shows a break mark ' I ‘at the left-hand margin and a r at the 0.5″ point.
Press Alt+T again to indent a further 0.5″.
Reduce the indent by Alt+M (see Task 24).
…
After typing
Highlight the paragraph(s) to be reformatted and make the appropriate keystrokes as shown above.
Cancelling paragraph styles
1
Select (highlight) the paragraph(s) to be returned to the default style (ie the fully blocked style)
2
Hold down Alt and tap P for Plain paragraph format
Memory jogger
You can give many commands before or after typing in text.
Try to become flexible in your approach.
Text creation
1
TYPE Your Own Name 
2
Tap Enter 3 times
3
TYPE in the text of Task 26.
Tap Enter twice after the first paragraph
4
TYPE the rest of the task in the hanging paragraph style, tapping Enter twice after each paragraph
Amendments
1
Proofread, correct, SAVE and log your work (filename:YourInitials26 , see Task 4).
PRINT it (Task 8)
2
Reformat all the paragraphs, but not the heading, in the indented style.
Remember to cancel the hanging paragraph format first.
Centre the heading and underline it (see Tasks 14 and 13 respectively)
3
PRINT a copy (see Task 8)
4
Clear the screen (see Task 4).
Task 26
PROGRAMS
The world's computer market is awash with software programs for every kind of application.
(Notice that ‘programs’ is spelt differently from the ‘programmes’you may watch on TV).
On personal computers some of the most common application programs are:
(1) WORD PROCESSORS
From basic letter-writers to sophisticated desktop publishing systems, WP programs specialise in the manipulation of text and graphics.
(2) SPREADSHEETS
These are grids on which calculations may be performed with great ease: after the spreadsheet has been set up!
Setting up may involve a range of difficulty, from adding columns of figures to give simple totals, to a mind-boggling series of linked formulas.
A spreadsheet can be recalculated immediately even if only one figure changes, or if many change at the same time.
This means that a business can easily work out what would happen if its sales, purchases, wages etc were all to change at different rates, with some going up and some going down.
(3) DATABASES (or database management systems — DBMS)
Imagine a record card with boxes for different kinds of information: name, address, telephone number, age, sex, estimated income, creditworthiness.
A DBMS can store, retrieve, update and compare this information on millions of ‘record cards’ so that it can be used for business purposes.
Direct mail selling frequently uses database information to try and sell only to those people whom the seller thinks are the most likely to give him a sale.
Task 27
Objective
Formatting line endings: hyphens and the hard space
Long words wrapped around to a new line can spoil a document's right-hand side.
Hyphenating them may overcome this problem.
There are 3 types of hyphen: ordinary, soft and hard (or ‘non-breaking’).
Ordinary hyphen
Tap the Hyphen key (—) once.
The ordinary hyphen is used between words that are hyphenated wherever they appear in a line and when those words would be split by a line-ending at the hyphen-point: eg well-known, time-consuming, up-to-date.
Soft hyphen
Hold down Ctrl and tap the Hyphen key (—) once.
Use the soft hyphen in words which would not be hyphenated if they fell in the middle of a line.
The hyphen is ‘soft’ because it disappears when reformatting moves the ‘hyphenated’word to the middle of a line.
More than one soft hyphen can be inserted into a word, as in ‘communications’ in Task 27 below.
Hard hyphen
Hold down Ctrl and Shift together and tap the Hyphen key (—) once.
The hard hyphen is used in words or figures which should not be separated by a line-ending even though they contain hyphens: a name like Templeton-Brown, for instance; or 1939–45 or -5 degrees C.
Hard space
Hold down Ctrl and tap the Spacebar once.
Use it to prevent words splitting at line-endings.
Eg between ‘10’ on one line and ‘pm’on the next, a hard space would put'10 pm' on one line.
Text creation
1
Set the typing line to 6″ (60 characters).
(Left margin 1.
25″; right margin 1″ on an A4 page: Task 18)

Only type in the ordinary hyphens shown
Amendments
1
Hyphenate ‘communications’ using soft hyphens in 3 places successively: ‘com-muni-ca-tions’.
Watch how the word wraps back to the previous line.
(If your soft hyphens are visible tap:Esc ape,O ptions,→ ;,(RightDown).
At the prompt show non-printing symbols:tap N (for None)
2
Notice that the name ‘Templeton-Brown’ has now split at the end of a line
3
Delete the ordinary hyphen in ‘Templeton-Brown’ and insert a hard hyphen
4
Justify the whole document.
(Tap a direction key to clear the highlight) Proofread, correct, SAVE and log your work (filename:YourInitials27 ,see Task 4).
PRINT it (see Task 8).
Task 27
At last week's meeting of the Computer Buffs Club, the vice-chairman, Mr Braithwaite, introduced the visiting speaker as usual.
On this occasion it was the well-known communications specialist from New Zealand, Mr William Templeton-Brown.
He lectured on the subject of microcomputers and electronic mail, using film clips and slides to good effect.
He suggested several ways in which a group such as the Club could reduce the time members have to spend trying to keep up-to-date with the latest developments.
Task 28
Objective

5
Tap Enter 
The cursor now selects (highlights) the first instance of the search text in the document below its starting position which meets the requirements of the two default conditions,case:(No)and whole word:(No).
It will highlight instances which are both whole words themselves and parts of other words, and in both upper and lower case letters.
(Eg if ‘Painting’ existed in the document and the search text: was ‘paint’, the ‘Paint’in ‘Painting’would be selected even though it has an initial capital and is part of another word.)
To search for text: above the cursor (omit step 1 above and) select:direction:(Up)of the same case (or mix of cases) as the search text select:case:(Yes)including whole words only select:whole word:(Yes)
Repeat search
Hold down Shift and tap the F4 key once.

The mouse is a hand-held device connected to a computer which can be used in conjunction with a keyboard.
Its shape resembles a mouse with a cable for a tail and buttons for eyes.
The operator's hand rests on top of the mouse with the first and second fingers over its ‘eyes’.
Sliding the mouse over the desk top beside the computer rotates a direction-sensitive ball inside it which in turn moves a pointer over the screen.
Commands are chosen from an onscreen menu by touching them with the tip of the pointer and executed by pressing one or both of the buttons.
On colour monitors, the pointer can be used as a paintbrush.
Paint is represented by red, blue, green and other squares of colour at the side of the screen.
Pictures are created by dipping the pointer into the colours and painting-in the screen as desired.
Thick or thin lines of paint or a sprayed effect can be obtained.
Painting is also possible on some screens using a light-pen.

Task 29
THE FUTURE OF WORK
The cheapness and power of the latest computer and communications systems provide opportunities for new ways of organising work.
One view of the future of work is that large firms will not employ the enormous numbers of people they employ today.
Instead they will be made up of a small professional core supplemented by part-timers plus a number of small firms to which they will contract out work.
The ability to communicate cheaply over long distances will reduce the need for workers to commute to offices.
They will be able to work from home using the firm's computer equipment.
This may involve self-employment with a measure of backing from the firm.
Companies dispersed in this way will tend to use local firms more than they do today, reinforcing a trend towards small-scale enterprises.
In fact, it is expected that most of the growth in work will come, not from big firms, still less from manufacturing, but from new small firms.
These firms will offer personal services: services that are less likely to be subject to automation.
It is unlikely that people training for work today will be prepared for a job for life.
Instead they will have to retrain in future, perhaps to do jobs they cannot even imagine today.
Experiments and trends in these directions are visible now.
Some say they are the ‘shape of things to come’.

BYTE:
the amount of memory a computer needs to describe one character of text, data or a program.
Because a byte is very small, memory size is usually spoken of in terms of thousands or millions of bytes (kilobytes or megabytes respectively).
NLQ:
near letter-quality.
High quality dot matrix printing which looks nearly as good as material which has been typed.
WIDOWS & ORPHANS:
a widow is the first line of a paragraph left alone at the foot of a page and an orphan is the last line of a paragraph carried over to the top of a new page.

Task 32
Many companies around the world are developing machines which can respond to, store and replay, synthesise and recognise speech.
Builtin computers are the brains behind them.
There are machines which will act on a spoken command.
Spoken messages can be stored in electronic mailboxes and retrieved by telephone, and by several people at the same time — because the messages are not recorded as on a tape recorder, but on electronic pulses in the computer's memory.
Voice operation has spread furthest where the problems encountered by developers are least difficult to solve.
It is comparatively easy to make a machine respond to a simple sound; such as is needed to enter numbers on a spreadsheet.
The same is true of storing and playing back voices.
The greatest barrier to full voice operation is the difficulty of achieving voice recognition.
The difference between a machine which responds to mere sound and one which responds to the spoken language is like the difference between the speaking clock and the operator in the telephone system.
The former reads a prepared script whenever the number is dialled and can do no more.
The latter makes up what she says on the spot depending on the enquiry.
She can do this because she understands what the enquirer is saying.
It takes a lot of computing power to achieve even a semblance of human understanding.
This has held back the development of voice operation.
However, computers which process information much faster than before, and programming techniques which emulate the way language works are developing rapidly.
They are jointly overcoming the key problem in voice recognition: the great complexity of the spoken language.

Task 33
DESKTOP PUBLISHING
The need for expensive typesetting machinery or in-house printing departments has been greatly reduced by the advent of desktop publishing systems.
A typical desktop publishing system consists of a personal computer connected to a laser printer, using powerful word processing and page layout software.
The page layout software and the laser printer make the big difference compared with traditional methods.
Pages can be typeset onscreen and different versions tried out without the need for referral back to typesetters.
The laser printer can be linked to a large number of terminals working independently, which maximises its usefulness.
