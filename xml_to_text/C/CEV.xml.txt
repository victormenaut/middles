CHRISTMAS
Carpeted pavements,
And veiled hung breath.
Spangled iced fingers,
High domed Heavens.
Steaming warm kitchens,
Collars turned high,
Crackling tanned chestnuts,
Sparkling child's eyes.
Firelight reflecting,
Red wax candles,
Treble voiced choirboys,
 Spicy hot pies.
Peach-faced innocents,
With peeking eyes,
Through dark fringed lashes,
Watch, expecting.
Bulging full stockings,
The magic works!
And children's laughter,
As morning breaks.
So — Christmas is here,
And once again,
Rejoice — give thanks that —
The Christ Child comes.
JUNE 27th 1962
Oxford stood to honour him,
The man who so bewitched us.
City shields — sun bedazzled,
City Fathers —stern faced pride.
Surging crowds, a full twelve deep,
United in their loving.
Rippled excitement — he comes!
Swaying mass lurch to see him.
I went to pay my homage,
To this man of the century.
He bestowed a precious gift,
Touching Mankind's soul world-wide.
Breaking down creed and colour,
With broadside shots of laughter.
He levelled with me yards away,
And then someone called his name.
He turned — came to where I stood,
I felt I had met a friend.
So I had — everyone's friend,
This man fair Oxford honoured.
Now he's gone — we're left grieving,
A light dimmed at his passing.
I have a lasting picture,
Broad tanned face, sweeping forehead.
Eyes — deep blue — glowing kindness,
The eyes of Charlie Chaplin.
THE DYING MAN
‘Can anyone out there hear me?
Will anyone come to my call?
Does anyone, anywhere see,
When my courage stumbles and falls?’
The man who stands here before you,
So powerful and tall and strong,
Make them see.
If only they knew —
How he hungers, and needs and longs —
For them to look into his eyes,
And see that he's very afraid,
That, no matter how he may try,
He just cannot always be brave.
He's always alone with his feelings,
'though he strives very hard to be strong,
He cannot be rid of the yearnings,
But surely they cannot be wrong!
To need love, somebody caring,
Who will comfort, take hold of his hand,
By giving their time and, by sharing —
Will show that they understand —
How he feels in his isolation,
That the pain imprisons him in,
That they know of his desolation,
And how hard it has all been.
I beg you, remember he's dying,
And that he's relying on you.
Listen — can you hear death sighing?
Yes — she's stalking your shadow too!
A glance back over your shoulder,
Will confirm that I do not lie,
'though you're not a day older,
She is there, and you are to die.
Fear fills your heart — you are learning —
That what I am saying is true.
You feel that same frantic yearning —
His pleas flood back now to you…
‘Can anyone out there hear me?
Will anyone come to my call?
Does anyone, anywhere see,
When my courage stumbles and falls?’…
LIFE'S SPAN
A day for growing,
A day for loving,
A day for giving,
A day for sowing,
A day for reaping,
A day for fading,
And on the seventh there is our dying.
CRIMSON POPPIES
Memorial shaft — November sky,
Thud of leather — dull on pave,
Sharp-snapped command — young heads held high,
Crimson poppies — each a grave.
Dull drums beat time — each measured stride
Proud banners flutter and wave,
Shoulder to shoulder and side by side,
Crimson poppies — each a grave.
Soft prayers are murmured — heads bent low,
The ‘Last Post’ for souls so brave,
Remembered men of long ago,
Crimson poppies — each a grave.
A woman scans the eager lines,
A single young face she seeks,
There you are!
Oh son of mine —
God in loving mercy save —
My boy from a crimson grave.
WHAT'S AFOOT
Something's on!
Something's strange!
Something's in the air!
They are sweeping the roads!
Pegging the rates!
Behaving as though they really DO care…
About babies living in high-rise flats,
That we're paying too much income tax.
That the National Health is slowly dying,
That three million men have given up trying.
That children aren't getting the right education,
That rivers and lakes are clogged with pollution.
That the nuclear race is out of hand,
That corruption spreads throughout the land.
That our old are conned into sheltered housing,
While developers move in and make a killing.
What can it all mean?
What's the expectation?
Could there be planned a General Election!
AFRICA
Listen, you hear it on the wind,
See it written in the dust.
Smell it hanging in the air,
Feel it on everything you touch.
Listen to shrilling night fall sounds,
See it in the haze shroud heat.
Smell it rising from baking earth,
Feel it pounding beneath your feet.
It's the cry for us all to hear,
See the message writ afar.
Smell the warning to all Mankind,
Feel the heart of Africa.
JUSTICE (with apologies to John Betjeman)
‘I'm guilty sir — the law I flout,
A Company Exec. am I,
Over a ton, and they caught me out,
My souped-up Jag.
just flies!’
Two men, one woman, magistrates,
In a neat solemn row they sit,
‘I only sped,’ the plaintiff states,
‘Not a man or a beast was hit.’
‘I lunched well that day 'tis very true,
Well, that's a perk that one expects,
I'd drunk a bit— a tot or two —
Befitting a Company Exec.
‘Pushed the revs. — Lord how she can fly!
A full throttle — gave her her head.’
He gave no thought that someone could die,
That blood could have been shed.
‘Now sir — I need the car you see,
So that I may wheel and deal.
My first million has to come to me,
Before I am over the hill.’
‘Oh well good sir,’ the chairman said,
‘That's a notion that I hold sway.
To money you were born and bred,
The law mustn't stand in your way!
‘After all when it is said and done,
You're out from the very top drawer.
A public school, field honours won —
How can any of us say more?
‘We rule you pay one hundred pounds,
Plus twenty-five more for our costs.
Keep your licence to get around,
For your million must not be lost!’
‘Next,’ calls the usher.
‘Face the Bench,’
The clerk stands and reads the charge.
‘Your van did 80!
Where's your sense!
A curse to the public at large!’
The chairman glared toward the dock,
‘Defendant — what have you to say?
I think you need a short sharp shock,
Before you're allowed home today.’
‘Sir.
me wife took sick.
she's alone;
I'd been working since early morn,
I sped me van to get me 'ome
I'd not seen 'er since 'fore dawn.
‘I didn't mean no arm me Lord,
And I was sure to take good care.
I need me van for food and board.
And to keep four children dear.’
‘Come come good man, you broke the law.’
‘But gov'ner I didn't mean to
'TIS 'ard for me to come before —
This court and to speak to you.
‘I'm an ordinary working man,
Not used to all this flutter.
But sir, I'll tell you man to man,
The truth, the whole truth I utter.
‘I 'ad to get 'ome to me love,
I knew she was ill and in pain.
As e's me witness — God above,
I will not go speedin' again.’
‘I've heard enough, my patience is through,
Your licence we'll have for a year.
I've seen a lot of the likes of you,
One-fifty, and costs, is that clear?’
‘What about me job?
What shall I do?
No van, then no work will be found.’
‘My man — I have my problems too —
I'm late for my golfing round!’
LOVING YOU
I lie and watch your sleeping face,
See you stretch upon the bed.
With my finger I gently trace —
Strong hands flung above your head.
I listen to your deepening sigh,
And marvel at your beauty.
Then closer to your heart I lie —
And long for you to come to me.
LAVENHAM
Like something out of a picture book,
That precious corner of Suffolk,
It draws me back and I stand and look,
Drink in our past, our history.
Leaning houses, cork-twist chimneys,
Ribbon thin smoke tracing the sky,
Golden lit windows beckoning me,
Beacons in cold snow-scape.
That mediaeval square around stark column,
With timbers blackened dark with age,
And foot-smoothed stone, gnarled gargoyle solemn,
Wrought iron railings spiral curling.
Bow-front shops, along winding street,
Snaking away up cobbled hill.
Where our time and the past suddenly meet,
Entwined, bewitching history.
I walk away and down to ‘The Swan’,
To plates of scones with jam and cream,
A blazing hearth welcomes me alone,
Deep chair enfolds close around me.
Staring at the fire's deepening glow.
The distant past remembering,
And again a lonely trek I'll go —
To seek anew fair Lavenham.
THE HUNT
There is no more an awful sound,
Than the nearing bay of huntsman's hound,
Or the piercing call of the horn,
As pounding hooves churn fields of corn.
There is no more an awful fear,
As men and dogs and steeds draw near,
Or the crashing, hammering beat,
Of a frantic heart in wild retreat.
Tawny fox, wild-eyed, breaks cover,
Across the heath, then up and over,
Hedge and ditch 'long banks she slithers,
And plunges headlong to the river.
A desperate bid to screen her scent,
Before her ebbing will is spent,
Before her very urge to fight,
Fades 'fore the onset of the night.
She is seen.
She'll not get away,
To see the dawn of another day,
She will be doomed to stand at bay,
When men and hounds will have their way.
A chilling shriek will mark her end,
A sound so dreadful that it will send —
An icy path along the spine,
Of any with half a heart or mind.
GOODBYE
One kiss — a seed is sown,
One pain — a child is born,
One glance — and she is grown,
One sigh — and she is gone.
THE ZEEBRUGGE FERRY
Come, hold my hand my darling,
Lest we're parted by the crowd,
That sweeps up on to the deck,
To glimpse sea and low slung cloud.
Come, stand by me my darling,
That I ever keep you near,
I'm moved to see your loveliness,
Your voice I need to hear.
Come, lean on me my darling,
As the ship slides smooth away,
So that we may be together,
And think over this perfect day.
Come close to me my darling,
To protect you from the chill,
That springs from off the harbour,
And then lifts upon the swell.
Come, watch with me my darling,
As the coast begins to fade,
Watch the sun caress the water,
Why — you're suddenly afraid!
Come, turn to me my darling,
There's nothing for you to fear,
‘Tis the crash of wave 'gainst the stem,
Don't tremble — for I am near.
Come into my arms my darling,
Let my lips caress your face,
The sea has come to claim us —
We lie in eternal embrace.
LONGING
This is the time my darling,
To be held close against your heart.
A precious time for loving,
When nothing can tear us apart.
I love your strength and tenderness,
Your eyes catching hold of mine,
The thread of togetherness,
Binding us forever in time.
I listen for your step on stair,
And I long for your gentle touch,
Strong arms that enfold me near,
I know that you love me so much.
You crush men in single blows,
And yet gently you lifted me,
Tenderly you let me know,
Of your deepest love eternally.
I wait now for you to come,
Listen for the sound of your voice
Long for us to be alone,
And know that if I had a choice…
I would choose one day with you,
Rather than win an added year,
Helpless in my love for you,
I am yours forever my dear.
SHATTERED DREAMS
A single shot to shatter a dream,
But the boy, almost grown to a man,
Not able to think of things unseen,
Cannot expect to understand.
At full nineteen he stood at life's door,
Untouched by shots over the sea,
Or death of a symbol of the poor,
Man of peace — the Mahatma Gandhi.
The boy went on to be fully grown,
Man's inhumanity — clearly seen,.
And in his mind there was firmly sown,
A lovely and a wondrous dream.
That all are one, no matter their creed,
Or that people may differ in colour,
That white men should loosen hold their greed,
To love and respect their black brother.
Across the world they heard this man,
And as they marched they'd joyously sing,
In their thousands, then millions they came,
One shot brought down Martin Luther King…
THE PARTING
You are part of me now my dear,
This feeling is bigger than me,
It has all become so very clear,
Without your love I cannot be.
Can you guess what is in my heart?
See in the windows of my soul?
That now you and I are forced apart,
I'm longing to have you to hold.
A part of me my darling has died,
There's an ache which is almost pain,
And no matter how much I have tried,
I'll not rest 'til I see you again.
DO YOU REMEMBER…
Do you remember syrup of figs?
Ration books and dry powdered milk?
Blacked out windows along pitch dark streets?
Suspenders, and stockings of silk?
Do you remember lessons on slates?
The sound of a doodle-bug's drone?
And arriving home one afternoon —
To a roofless pile which was home?
‘You're showing a light!’
The wardens cried
‘Blimey, put it bloody well out!
The 'ome Guard'll 'ave yere guts for garters
If yere give our whereabouts!’
Do you remember thunderous black trains
Roaring alive 'long silver tracks?
Polished waiting-rooms with crackling fires?
Lady porters in daring slacks?
Do you remember barrage balloons
Bobbing around like airborne swine?
The search lights criss-crossing London skies?
And the sound of the sirens’ whine?
Remember the Andersen shelter?
And tins of American beer?
 Hoards of GIs — all tan and crew cuts
Listening for the shrill ‘all-clear’?
V2s came over night and morning,
And we children were always there,
Waiting and watching down by the shops —
For a hit!
Then off with Cape pears!
I could not remember my Father,
He'd gone when no more than a lad,
Each night I would kiss an old photo,
Of the man I was told was my Dad.
News-sellers cried ‘Star, News and Standard ‘
And muffins with jam up at Lyons,
All part of my childhood memories,
When a dinner cost one and nine!
Digging to win on the allotment,
With the dog and my old Grandad,
Then home for thick dripping on ‘doorsteps’,
The hearth piled with bright nutty-slag.
FORGIVE ME LORD
Spirit and God and Holy Son,
I strive to understand,
That the Trinity is one,
That I am in His hand.
Forgive me Lord — my eyes are dim,
I strive to see your face,
I know that you are here within,
That you may grant me grace.
If only I'd lived 'longside you,
If only I'd touched your hand,
If I'd been of your chosen few,
Then I would understand.
Then, just as I began to fall,
I heard your voice so clear,
I distinctly heard you call,
And felt your presence near.
Just then I understood full well,
The meaning of it all.
All of my doubts you gently quelled,
I responded to your call.
But why oh Lord do you want me?
You know how bad I am.
Call someone else to answer Thee,
Please leave me if you can.
But no, you have fast your hold,
There's nothing for me to do.
Except to do as I am told,
And rise to follow You.
I stand before the pure white Host,
And calm my inner fears,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Thou kiss away my tears.
CAMBRIDGE
Flat bottomed punts with straw boatered dandies
Anxious to please their trilling young ladies.
Bow-backed bridges and canopied willows,
Which curtsy before still-watered mirrors.
Blue-winged dragons o'er dappled Cam skimming,
Forked tailed martins, dipping and winging.
Crystal iced spires in twinkling reflection,
Sharp intake of breath at such perfection.
Kings own fair chapel, moving the soul,
River-side Queens, tiny Trinity Hall.
History steeped walls and high ribbed oak,
Peterhouse, Girton, Jesus and Pembroke.
Names handed on from one to another,
Where all men were scholars, all men were brothers.
They came from lands across the sea,
Fair Cambridge they came to honour thee.
Raven gowned dons having tea together,
It seemed that time might stand still forever.
Who would have thought that the pattern would break?
That today's Cambridge scene could be such a fake?
Now the City is swamped with brutish louts,
Shattering old charm with their foul-mouthed shouts
There's nothing fair about today's fair sex,
As they pass round the Polos and packs of Durex.
Both boys and girls are a strange looking bunch,
They roll up their joints, smoke pot with their lunch.
Each sporting earrings, blue hair and green,
And screaming abuse and all that's obscene.
Benches upended, sprayed on  graffiti ,
Passed on to the next by the country's elite.
Bins overflowing with last night's garbage,
What a stunning, numbing, shocking wastage.
A TREE
When you were born I planted a tree,
A sprig no thicker than my thumb.
It was a gift to you from me,
In grateful thanks that you had come.
You had golden hair and wide blue eyes,
And a laugh which could melt the snow,
A baby who would seldom cry,
It all seems a long time ago.
You grew up straight and you grew up tall,
And the sun rose with your smile,
You were so much loved by us all,
A delightful and precious child.
I watched you grow with love and concern
And showed you the right path to take,
I watched you understand and learn,
I suffered your every mistake.
And I gently put you on your feet,
I held you firmly by the hand,
I took you through old London's streets,
And showed you this lovely land.
I took you over many a sea,
Travelled countries far and near,
You were there alongside me,
I gave you all I had my dear.
You've seen pure iced wastes and deserts glare,
Tipped mountains and caverns yawning,
The birth of islands from the air,
A rose-pink Everest dawning.
You've watched steam bubbling from the earth,
You've felt a glacier tremble,
You've seen a mother giving birth,
Migrating thousands assemble.
You have strode the moors and climbed high dales,
Seen Niagara's curtains foaming,
Watched eagles soar and spouting whales,
And listened to old Etna groaning.
Now you've flowered into a beauty,
You've blossomed and away you have flown,
To let you go is my final duty,
I knew that you were only on loan.
Your life's before you and I am left,
And when sadness takes hold of me,
When I'm down and feeling bereft,
I look at your lovely cherry tree.
MITZIE
The dogs down our road look over their shoulder,
And give our house a wide berth,
They would need to be a whole lot bolder —
And daring, to show their worth.
You see —word's got around our neighbourhood,
That Mitzie's arrived to stay,
She has made it quite plain and understood —
That all dogs have had their day!
She's not very big, all eyes and pert ears,
A tail with expressive curl.
She sits on the roof and smirks at our fears,
Our Mitzie is quite a girl.
Dad's best jacket makes a super snug bed,
The moment his back is turned.
She snoozes until it's time to be fed,
And best double cream is churned.
It goes without saying — the fireside chair
Is naturally hers by right,
My claim is met by her unblinking glare,
As she stalks off into the night.
She's queen of the rose beds and tended lawn,
The terror of every mouse,
Out on the tiles until well after dawn,
Comes home — and takes over the house.
But you know, she has her sweet way with me,
When her nose prods under my chin,
And when she's curled on my honoured knee,
It's as if it's always been.
Mitzie — there is not the slightest doubt that —
You are the cutest and funniest cat!
ENGLAND IN THE EIGHTIES
Their turn to face pounding fear,
Hear the screams above roaring guns,
To feel chill death creeping near,
And to know that their time had come.
Peace at last— then probes in space,
Computers to rule over man,
Then began a headlong race,
To start armies marching again.
Old men of Flanders out-run,
By robotic men of steel,
Programmed never to overcome,
An inborn urge to kill.
Old men of Flanders turned around,
And saw a world losing its style,
Carrying men faster than sound,
And inventing Cruise missiles.
Old ladies — blanket swaddled,
Waiting for our love and care, while —
Old men on benches huddled,
And fortunes are spent on Cruise missiles.
THE CHRISTENING
My little one, I look at you,
And my heart overflows with love.
Sweet baby girl, what can I do —
But give thanks to God above?
For a child given here to me,
For placing her hand in mine.
Now for all of the world to see,
We're joined 'til the end of time.
Couched warm and safe and with me here,
Surrounded by so much love,
Your misty eyes hold mine my dear,
You're sent from Heaven above.
Such peace upon this mountain side,
With the house way up the hill,
Such love, such trust, such brimming pride,
Greatest joy — we have our fill.
The priest returns you safe to me,
And your father's eyes meet mine.
Feelings are clear for all to see,
A moment is captured in time.
The august crowd around warm stone,
United — one heart — one mind,
Pray God holds you and makes you one —
With all that is good and kind.
Little girl, I hope and pray,
That you're never alone with pain,
That there will never come a day,
When you cry for help in vain.
That when you reach out for a friend,
Find a heart that's turned to stone —
When you need help, but in the end —
You're left to struggle alone.
I hold you near, close to my heart,
There's so much for me to give,
Where to begin?
Where do I start?
To show you my dear how to live?
I wish I could give you all that's best,
But all that I can do,
Is to pray — leave God to do the rest,
For I know that He cares for you.
TWO SHADOWS
Two shadows crossed — I looked up at you,
And met a pair of laughing eyes,
A slow, warm smile — perhaps I knew —
Somehow, sometime, we'd share our lives.
That day of days shines for me in time,
The mountains were ours at our feet.
Our minds, our hearts joining, yours and mine,
Was it decreed that we should meet?
How we laughed and rode throughout that day,
It all appeared somehow to me,
That in some inexplicable way,
It was always meant so to be.
When your hand took mine to steady me,
With your eyes firmly holding mine,
I turned away so you might not see,
My senses pounding out of time.
Was it fancy?
Was I full awake?
That when you came and said goodbye
Your eyes, your smile told me —‘just you wait’…
‘We will meet yet again — you and I.’
Now you are gone, now we are apart,
And I try to push you away,
But I'm looking deep into my heart,
And I know that I count the days —
When I shall catch sight of you again,
When you come striding up to me,
When I see you feeling just the same,
Knowing our love just has to be.
TILLINGHAM HALL
They want to take our Green Belt away,
Well — it's only a mile or two,
Not a treasured site with any sway,
Or one with a famous view.
In truth this land could be seen as drear,
Flat marsh spread down to the Thames,
Far horizons seem to loom up near,
A wild and mysterious fen.
Stark black fingers reach up to the sky,
Tongues of mist roll over in waves,
Air filled with plaintive curlew cry,
Soft light filters through a haze.
But this land has a strong hold on me,
It's part of my inner soul,
I thought that it would always be,
And left wild, wondrous and whole.
But it's caught the eye of the business man,
Developers swarm from the west,
They wheel and they deal and plot and plan,
And decide how they might best —
Lie to us boldly, straight down the line,
Say the Belt has had its day,
That we really all should move with time,
Let developers have their way.
‘Think,’ they say, ‘of rows of new homes,
And streets laid straight as a die,’
Forget that it's land where wild life roams,
Forget shrill heron's stark cry.
But you don't fool me, you greedy men,
You attempt to blind us all,
It's money you want, and you'll make when —
You build on Tillingham Hall.
Yes you go through all of the motions,
The Ministry men are on hand,
But they don't believe in the notion,
That we are in love with the land.
Already there in the business man's eye,
Machines and men have moved in.
Towers of brick reach up to the sky,
As though the land had never been.
It's money that's the name of the game,
Developers have heard the call.
To hell with heritage, and the land,
There's money in Tillingham Hall.
