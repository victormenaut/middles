No peace for ‘hyped’ Don-E
DON-E, British soul hopeful, is at the centre of the latest investigation into chart hyping following irregular sales patterns surrounding the singer's recent ‘Peace In The World’ 45.
The BPI clampdown following suspicious activities surrounding Don-E's August single once again calls into question the credibility of the singles chart, after a spate of hyping controversies last year involving London Records, Rhythm King and Virgin Records and artists like S-Express and The High.
Don-E's Island release ‘Peace In The World’ was disqualified from the charts after the hi-tech security system used by chart compilers Gallup picked up an unusually high concentration of sales in the south London area.
Gallup's concern over the unusual sales pattern was heightened when several record shops in the area phoned in with details of the registration number of a car used in the alleged hyping.
Following the submission of a Gallup report on the matter the BPI have decided to instigate a full investigation with hearings set for early September.
A BPI spokesperson told trade magazine Music Week : ‘It was felt that suspicions were sufficiently strong to justify a full enquiry.’
Island Records have consistently denied knowledge of any questionable sales tactics, claiming they are ‘blameless’.
However, it is widely recognised within the music industry that the use of ‘target teams’ and pressure selling is common in the singles market.
CONSOLIDATED have announced details of their keenly anticipated third album.
The 27-track LP, ‘Play More Music’, is released on the Nettwerk Europe label on September 28.
‘Play More music’, which follows last year's highly acclaimed ‘Friendly Fascism’ LP, was self-produced by the San Francisco-based three-piece and mixed by Meat Beat Manifesto's Jack Dangers.
HAPPY MONDAYS have been forced to delay the release of their long-awaited single ‘Stinkin' Thinkin'’ until September 7.
The band's first single from the forthcoming album ‘…
Yes Please’ has been held back due to production problems surrounding their promotional video.
Details of their biggest UK tour in three years are expected next week.
Madstock mess rumbles on
MORRISSEY and organisers of the ill-fated Madstock Finsbury Park concerts are embroiled in a legal battle, with both parties threatening to sue each other over Morrissey's non-appearance on the Sunday bill.
A spokesperson for Morrissey confirmed that ‘legal discussions are underway’ and it's believed he is consulting his advisers over non-payment of his performance fee.
Promoters, The Mean Fiddler Group, are said to be seeking compensation for  non-fulfilment of his contract as well as a separate settlement for bringing their organisation into disrepute.
In a bizarre twist to the story,NME has learned that the robbery of a Mean Fiddler employee nearly led to the cancellation of the second day of the festival.
Nearly £35,000 in cash and £450,000 in cheques is believed to have been stolen from the administrator's home following the first show on Saturday.
Only a last-minute collection of Mean Fiddler reserve funds, driven to the Finsbury Park site in a Securicor van, allegedly prevented the bands pulling on the Sunday.
The Mean Fiddler declined to comment on the legal battle and the theft.
•Meanwhile, LEVITATION have been forced to move their warm-up show for this weekend's Reading Festival from London Clapham Grand tonight to the New Cross Venue.
According to one insider, the Mean Fiddler organisation has refused to host any Reading warm-ups after losing the franchise to the festival earlier this year.

BA announces departures
THE BLUE AEROPLANES had another two members bale out from the band last week, with the departure of bassist Andy McCreeth and guitarist Hazel Winter.
The line-up is now down to a five-piece, guitarist Angelo Bruschini having quit the group less than a month ago.
No official reason was given for McCreath and Winter leaving, but rumours suggest that they had tired of their peripheral roles within the band set-up.
Despite the upheaval, the band will continue work on their forthcoming LP and also intend to play NME 's Viva Eight show with Green On Red and A House at London's Town & Country Club on September 3.
Mighty Lemon Drops bassist Marcus Williams, Katydids vocalist Susie Hugg and 18-year-old former roadie Bob will fill in on the day.
Singer Gerard Langley told NME : ‘I don't recall having any arguments with Hazel or Andy, but there was definitely an absence of enthusiasm from them.
I want to work with people who want to have a good time.
‘Andy wrote one song in four years and Hazel was halfway through her first of the year.
We're three-quarters of the way through our new LP, but it probably won't surface until next February.’
As previously reported, the band's second volume of B-sides and out-takes ‘Friendloverplane 2’ is released through Chrysalis on September 21.

Mute miffed at new chart
THE INDIE debate took a new turn last week, with the news that MUTE RECORDS may lead a boycott of the planned ‘alternative ’chart along with several other prominent independently distributed labels.
Mute's stance follows the news that music industry magazine Music Week is taking the first step to redefining the term ‘independent’ by running ‘a genre chart open to all-comers’, next to‘an old-style distribution chart’, from September 19.
The new chart has been given the thumbs up by Food Records Andy Ross, whose acts (including Blur and Jesus Jones) are exempt from the current chart.
He told NME : ‘This is not a question of a lobby trying to dismantle the independent chart, it's a matter of an established clique actively obstructing the creation of a chart.’
However, Mute General Manager Osman Eralp told NME : ‘The pathetic part of this whole situation is that the American industry is increasing its interest in independent distribution, because it realises that big is not necessarily better.
If there is no adequate coverage for independently distributed records, there is no doubt that the labels will suffer.’
POWER OF DREAMS, Dublin's fiery guitar quartet, have been dropped by Polydor after three years on the label.
The band, who were snapped up on the strength of their ‘Little Pieces Of God’ EP released on the indie Setanta label, issued six singles and two albums with Polydor.
Rumours of other major changes surround the label.
There have been several redundancies in the press and promotions department and former Undertones vocalist Feargal Sharkey has also been recruited to the company's A&R section.
A spokesperson for Polydor, however, denied that Power Of Dreams' exit was the cue for a major clear-out at the label.
HUNDREDS OF heavy metal fans were left stranded at Derby Station last Saturday when British Rail failed to run the usual special train to London after the massive Donington Monsters of Rock festival.
Advertised in the national press and mentioned on Radio 1, the service was to run at 12.15am, but on arrival at the station fans were told that BR had decided not to schedule the train this year and denied advertising the service.
Several hundred fans, already cold from intermittent rain, slept in the station overnight.
An unofficial BR source told NME that ‘The train is usually so full that it was considered too dangerous to run it this year.’

Madonna's Maverick menu
MADONNA is set to issue a new single, album and book, featuring some of her most controversial work to date.
The LP, titled ‘Erotica’, includes nine tracks written and produced in collaboration with Shep Pettibone, and three songs written and produced entirely independently.
Sources claim that material on the new LP, due in October through Madonna's own Maverick label, is a progression on the ‘Justify My Love’ theme.
The first single from the new LP is scheduled for release in late September, and follows Madonna's recent hit 45 ‘This Used To Be My Playground’, which will not feature on the LP.
‘Playground’ was written specifically for the movie In A League Of Their Own starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna which premieres in the UK in September, and is said to be unrepresentative of the material featured on the ‘Erotica’LP.
Meanwhile, a new book compiled by Madonna, and titled Sex is published by Maverick in September.

Sugar: coming to your Lo-Cal-ity
SUGAR, whose debut 45 ‘Changes’ is currently topping the NME Indie singles chart, release their LP ‘Copper Blue’in two weeks — and have already finished writing a follow-up!
A spokesperson for the band confirmed that the new material is more extreme than ‘Copper Blue’, signalling a return to Bob Mould's musical roots with Hüsker Dü.
‘Copper Blue’, meanwhile, is released on September 7 and features nine tracks including ‘Changes’, live favourite ‘Helpless’ and a new version of ‘If I Can't Change Your Mind’.
Following the power trio's acclaimed brace of London shows last month, they embark on their first national tour which calls in at .
Illinois outfit The Poster Children are rumoured to be supporting the band on all dates, although there was no official confirmation as NME went to press.

‘Upset’ Kurt pulls Seattle concert
NIRVANA made a shock 11th hour decision to cancel a major home-coming show in Seattle last Sunday.
The sold-out concert was scheduled to take place at Seattle's 15,000 capacity Coliseum, however, Nirvana are believed to have pulled out because Kurt Cobain was furious over an interview which appeared in Vanity Fair magazine which revealed that he and his wife Courtney Love had indulged in a drug ‘binge’ while Courtney was pregnant (see last week's NME ).
Inside sources claim that Cobain is devastated by the revelations, and the possibility that Nirvana may cancel their appearance at Reading Festival is very real, given that the band were prepared to scrap their jubilant homecoming show at just a few days' notice.
Rumours circulating in the UK last week, suggesting that Nirvana had planned to play with an extra guitarist at Reading, were hotly denied by a spokesman for the band.
Meanwhile, Nirvana's highly acclaimed debut LP ‘Bleach’ is reissued through Geffen on September 1.
Cassette formats feature one extra track ‘Big Cheese’, originally featured on the B-side of the band's debut single ‘Love Buzz’.
CDs also carry ‘Downer’, an extra track on the original Sub Pop American CD format of ‘Bleach’.
Nirvana are also believed to be working on cover versions of several seminal punk tracks for possible future release.

Orb lead Hawkwind revival!
THE ORB are planning to re-record a cover of the progressive rock classic ‘Silver Machine’ with original artists Hawkwind!

Their previous collaborations include work with prog-rock idol Steve Hillage on various Orb projects and with the offshoot-band System 7.
Meanwhile, The Orb have announced a 16-date tour for the autumn, including a marathon all-nighter at London's Brixton Academy.

The single will be issued through Southern in late September or early October.
All material derived from the ‘Fontanelle’ sessions will be released in the UK by Southern, as a condition of the major deal agreed between the Babes and Warner/Reprise.
The accompanying promo video for ‘Bruise Violet’ was shot live at the legendary CBGB's club in New York City.
Meanwhile, the Babes' 11 major UK shows kick off at London Kentish Town & Country Club, and continue throughout September and early October at .

‘Violet’ femmes, the Babes
SUEDE, who are on the verge of signing a major recording deal with Sony, have announced details of their second single and three September dates.
The single, ‘Metal Mickey’, follows the band's independent Number One debut ‘The Drowners’ and is issued through Nude on September 14, in addition to the title track, a lynchpin in the band's current live set, the single carries two exclusive tracks, ‘Where The Pigs Don't Fly’and ‘He's Dead’.
The band follow their appearance at the NME 's Gimme Shelter gig last month with gigs at .
The Sony deal is part of a link-up between the major and Suede's current home, Nude, but will exclude the UK where the label is to remain independent.

Come on indie rock!
Welcome the next generation of honest electric white boy blues in the form of SEBADOH!
Emotive grunge-pop ahoy — meet lyrically pained Newcastle foursome RAZORBLADE SMILE!
GILLETTE 'EM HAVE IT!
RAZORBLADE SMILE are masters of juxtaposition — both angelic and sinister — they're the kind of band who would baptise a newborn child in pig's blood.
‘We're aiming for that contradiction,’ explains Jim James, one of the band's two singing guitarists.
‘We don't want to be a painfully clichéd screaming and shouting band, we want tension but we want it to be a duel thing, two complete opposites fighting against each other wish us cutting through the middle.
You get an element of pain in our lyrics and I don't believe we have to scream to get that across.’
The Newcastle foursome formed in mid-1990, a product of college tedium.
Jim, along with singing partner Pete Lofty, drummer Chris Scott and bassist Dave Chary, grew tired of the make-it-big-quick policy adopted by the majority of British indie labels.
Earlier this year they released their awesome debut single ‘This Accurate Pain’ through Chocolate Narcotic (a friend's label) and distributed it, largely, themselves.
Vowing never to cut corners, they've mastered their spliced-up, emotive grunge-pop without haggling with The Man.
‘They seem to have a better idea of the indie ethic in America,’ muses Jim.
‘They do things for the fell of it and not for some kind of career motive.
Most of the smaller bands put out seven-inch singles themselves, whereas here everyone wants to be the next big thing and I hate all that.’
By rights, Razorblade Smile could easily be the Next Big Thing.
With American Hardcore tightening the grip on current musical trends — and the Brits struggling to withstand the pace — the Smile race in from behind like sprinters at a Strollathon.
Sounding like a variation of Buffalo Tom, the Pixies and Sebadoh (with hints of The Cure, Teenage Fanclub and Can), they've fused agonised tunes with fey and angst-riddled melodies.
‘We do go for a certain amount of fragility.
We like the vocals to be both timid and cutting,’ whimpers Peter.
‘But we also like to get the dynamics right…and I can't really sing any other way.’
One of the Smile's best tracks is ‘Elbow’, in which Pete sings powerfully evocative lyrics over hushed sections of a deceptively furious song.
‘I'm very self-conscious of my lyrics,’ he reflects.
‘I feel really nervous when I sing that one because it's a risk.
It's supposed to sound powerfully effective and menacing, as you said in the live review, like the theme tune to a serial killer.’
‘I like the idea of surprising people,’ snaps Jim.
‘We want to intimidate the audience but also make them feel with us.
Basically,’ he states in a conclusive tone ,‘we don't want to be obvious.’
Merely obviously wonderful.

‘Gimmie Indie Rock’ neatly traces the lineage of the American alternative, from the VU and The Stooges to hardcore and then Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, Dinosaur and Hüsker Dü.
‘It's the next generation of electric white boy blues/Come on indie rock!’ yells Seb's Lou Barlow over a hilariously generic sludge-out.
Lou ought to know.
For four years he pummelled bass with the Dino dudes before splitting in the summer of '89, thoroughly alienated by J Mascis’ autocratic tendencies and the band's impending major status.
He retreated into Sebadoh, releasing two albums of lo-fi acoustic introspection with help from drummer Eric Gaffney, a fellow veteran of the Massachusetts hardcore scene.
Then, joined by Jason Lowenstein, another drummer who also played bass and guitar, Sebadoh released ‘Gimmie Indie Rock’ as a single of Homestead last year.
Atypical of their material thus far, it also hinted at Barlow's imminent return from the backwoods.
‘It was totally laying out the future of Sebadoh,’ Lou confirms.
‘They got what they wanted, maybe Ii can get what I want too’’— let's go electric.
All that stuff on our first two records I think is really cool and in some ways I prefer it to what we're doing now, and I knew that once we took any of those songs and put them in an electric context people would go, ‘Duh, it's a good song!’.
I knew once we started playing electrically we wouldn't be confusing the journalists and they wouldn't think it was just some guy from Dinosaur masturbating in his room.
In a way I wish we hadn't re-released that song because it's not that strong.
I think it's kinda funny, it's good for about two listens.’
Despite the fact that both Eric and Jason contribute songs — on the sprawling 23-track ‘Sebadoh III’ album they share roughly half the groove space between them — this current electric Sebadoh set-up looks organised primarily to suit Barlow's brutally poignant, heart-snaring laments, of which he has an apparently endless supply.
Songs like ‘Brand New Love’ and ‘Its So Hard To Fall In Love’— covered much to Lou's flattered bewilderment by Superchunk — and newer material that will appear on the next full-length Sebadoh LP, to be released in the new year by Sub Pop and Roughneck, are typical of his style: eschewing traditional songwriting imagery and devices in favour of pure, honest expression.
‘When I was in Dinosaur I never though I had any real talent.
I was writing the same songs with the same approach but I thought they were all shit so I never brought them to J or I never tried to play them.
When I realised there was nothing else to do in the world but write my own songs and play, that's when I brought them out and did them.
And all of a sudden everyone's saying, ‘Oh my God, they're so honest!
Aren't you embarrassed?’
No!
I thought this is how everybody writes songs!’

ICE T'S COUNTRY COTTAGE AND TEA SHOP, LOS ANGELES
FOR SOMEONE whose music is as aggressive and uncompromising as Ice-T's, it comes as some surprise to discover that the rap superstar lives in a charming country cottage about ten miles from Los Angeles.
When he greets me at the door, he is still wearing an apron, after ‘helping out’ in the attached tea shop which he runs ‘as a bit of a hobby’.
How long has he owned the tea shop?
‘I bought it about two years ago.
It helps me relax after a hard day's rapping about controversial political and social issues.
Of course, I'm very committed to social change, but I leave all that behind me when I get back here.
Once I put the apron on (which sports a large portrait of Malcolm X) I'm just an ordinary tea man.’
Did the much talked about LA riots affect business?
‘Yes.
Actually the tea shop benefited slightly, because we'd introduced a new line of rock cakes that week, and some rioters came round to buy them to throw at middle class people.’
Outside the house, there's a large pond full of water lilies and tropical fish.
The sound of bird song drifts down from the trees, and butterflies flutter through the still early evening air.
‘This is where I wrote ‘Cop Killer’,’ says my genial host.
‘I wanted to write a thoughtful song about recent events, and it was important that I just didn't leap right in with an immediate gut reaction.’
In the music room, which has its walls lined with framed gold records and death threats from fundamentalist religious groups, Ice-T tells me about his future plans.
‘I heard Enya recently, and I'd like to work with her.
Although certainly not in a musical field.
Maybe she could come and help out in my tea shop.’
Speaking of which, the controversial rapper offers me another drink.
What'll I have?
Iced tea, of course!

‘BASTARDS!’
IT TAKES A URINATION OF MILLIONS…
•1971…
Van Der Graaf Generator, Rory Gallagher, Genesis, Ralph McTell, Osibisa and, erm, Country Jug.
1992…
The wonder Stuff, Public Enemy, Disposable Heroes Of Hiphoprisy, Nick Cave, Manic Street Preachers, Ride, Mudhoney, Teenage Fanclub and, erm, Nirvana…
In the 20 years since the National Jazz, Blues And Rock Festival relocated itself from sleepy London toff suburb, Richmond, to its present Thames Valley site, the Reading Festival has become the premier rock gig.
Glastonbury is the unmissable event , the grooviest vibe of the music year, but Reading is the heaviest bill, the most densely packed agglomeration of rawk bands and fans to be found anywhere.
It wasn't always so; in its time, Reading has also been a hippy haven, a pub rock paddock, a new wave Jamboree and the worst heavy metal headbangers' ball imaginable.
This all reached a peak in 1988 when piss-filled cider bottles rained down the hapless likes of Meatloaf (who ran away) and Bonnie Tyler (who didn't!).
Since then, it has enjoyed a much-needed facelift to become the hip and swinging indie (generic overlay) festival of the year.
Over the next four pages, our own walking, talking Reading Festival, KEITH CAMERON, raids the archives to present an affectionate look at two decades of open air guitar.
On page 13, however, STUART ‘I'm still taking Valium’ MACONIE recounts the full horror of 1988, the pivotal Reading that lead to the wonderment that awaits us this weekend.
The famous bottles-of-piss barrage at Reading '88
A field on the edge of the bland Thames Valley hub town of Reading.
It is mid-way through the afternoon of Friday August 23 and a band called Nirvana have just completed their allotted 40 minutes at the annual rock festival by throwing their equipment at each other.
The sun is burning, the crowd is going noisily mental and the security guards are looking anxious.
You want rock 'n' roll?
Hey, this is what it's all about.
A year later, and Nirvana will headline the 1992 Reading Festival, their staggering rise, post-Reading '91, making them obvious contenders for the prestigious Sunday night slot.
Like many before them, the Seattle trio had used a lowly billing at the traditional August Bank Holiday beano from which to launch an assault on the cloth-ears and closed minds that run the pop establishment.
It's been a popular strategy ever since The Rolling Stones played the small marquee at the 1963 National Jazz Festival in Richmond — the event that subsequently mutated into Reading — and provoked scenes of hysteria as hundreds of excited youths abandoned the main arena and jostled to catch a whiff of this liberating new air, leaving a bewildered Acker Bilk tootling his way into the footnotes of history.
But despite Mick 'n' Keef 'n' more besides, and playing an important role in shaping Britain's nascent youth culture, it is but recently that Reading has once again become the only place for any self-respecting hep cat to pitch a tent during late August.
For much of the past two decades it was Square City, the quaint, eccentric and often decidedly sick man of rock.
BY THE time it actually became based in Reading in 1971, the National Jazz, Blues & Rock Festival — as it would soon be known — had begun to epitomise all that was ominous about sitting on an ex-council rubbish tip amidst capricious weather and listening to the sound of the beat boom go bum.
Oh what joy, as the swing of the '60s gave way to the pong of the '70s, as flares creaked muddily in time to a trenchant progfolk-jazz-R&B soundtrack and the likes of Genesis, Rory Gallagher, Van Der Graaf Generator, Brewer's Droop and Greenslade became the staple Reading fare.
In 1974, for instance, that mid-Friday afternoon slot was grabbed by workaday pub rockers Chilli Willi And The Red Hot Peppers, an outfit notable only for featuring future Attraction Pete Thomas on drums and a manager in Jake Riviera who would eventually found Stiff Records.
This tiny detail in Reading's long history somehow epitomises its allegiance with a seamy, downbeat, quintessentially British rock tradition and would logically result in its gradual submission to the horrors of wall-to-wall heavy metal, bottle-battles and snapshots of birds-wiv-their-jugs-aht in the programme.
‘The Reading Festivals are well-organised, efficiently run, and good value for money.
These facts are indisputable.
The trouble is they are not events, they are not occasions, they are not exciting.
And, until (the organisers) can show a little more initiative in their booking policy, it will remain so.’
So ran the verdict of the NME way back in 1973.
To explain precisely why it took until 1989 for the Reading Festival to haul itself back into something resembling the land of the living requires a closer look at the origins of this venerable institution.
Reading '92 will be the 30th open-air musical bash organised by Barbara and Harold Pendleton, and the 20th to be held in Reading.
Proprietors of the Marquee Club from its original late '50s berth beneath the Academy Cinema on Oxford Street until 19887, apart from anything else the Pendletons thought it would be nice to gather their musician friends together for a weekend garden party, and so they staged the National Jazz Festival at Richmond Athletic Ground on August 26/27, 1961.
The star attractions included Chris Barber, Johnny Dankworth and the Clyde Valley Stompers, the St John's Ambulance dealt with 22 cases of wasp stings, there were no reported rucks between rival gangs of trad and modern jazz-heads, and the sun actually shone.
Like cool, daddio!
‘We did it just to book all the bands we knew,’ recalls Barbara Pendleton at her office in the Festival's West London HQ.
‘Turned out we knew everybody in the audience as well!
Anyway, it was good fun, so we did it again the next year.
Eventually, it became established.
So far as we're concerned we started an event for music that was an alternative — I didn't want to listen to Vera Lynn.
It's changed over the years, but it's still for what I'd like to think of as the intelligent, discerning young music fan.’
1963: the Stones play through some amplification borrowed from the back of a TV
1988: Glastonbury has a pyramid stage…
That the Pendletons' party ended up at Reading was down to a fair measure of fluke.
Throughout the '60s, the National festivals grew rapidly and were forced to become movable feasts due to constant licensing hassles — Windsor in '66 and '67, Kempton Park '68, Plumpton '69 and '70.
A regular pitch was sorely needed.
Meanwhile, Reading Council were lashing together a  municipal PR exercise, using as a dodgy pretext the 400th anniversary of the destruction of the local abbey by Henry VIII.
With a month to put together a programme of events for this ‘Reading Festival’, things weren't going well and the organisers approached London club owner Dave Bilk — yep, Acker's bro — who put them on to B & H.
‘I remember there were ducks, swimming on the site!’ says Barbara.
‘People said we were mad, it would never happen.
But of course it did, and in the end our event was the only one to make money for their thingy, and we stayed there.
We'd got a good relationship with the council.’
Not everyone in Reading was as grateful for this unlikely last minute salvation.
The drug squad launched a massive operation costing £17,000 and resulting in 112 arrests — some made by ‘rozzers’ disguised as hippies!— while the manager of the nearby Caversham Bridge Hotel barricaded his premises with 12-foot-high chain fencing.
‘The hotel will be open for meals,’ said Mr Paul Dogliani, ‘but pop fans who look like pop fans will not be served.’
But the festival returned the next year and gradually Reading grew to tolerate the pop fans.
Indeed, as administrator Myra Hickey points out, when the Labour council was elected in 1986 one of its manifesto commitments had been to bring back the festival which had been absent for the previous two years owing to the council reclaiming its original site.
‘I'm not saying they won because of that, but…people are used to it, it's been there for 20 years.’
Election-winner or not, for much of the '80s, punters were voting with their feet and staying well away from Reading.
The early part of the decade had seen the festival succumb entirely to the boys' own heavy metal hackery that at that point ruled the roost in certain quarters, most significantly the mind of Jack Barrie, Marquee General Manager and responsible for booking the bands.
1982 was the definitive Reading ROCK festival: Budgie, Iron Maiden and Michael Schenker headlined with a supporting cast of such acned arseholes as Terraplane and Praying Mantis, and old stagers Blackfoot and Tygers Of Pan Tang.
The spirit of Chilli Willi was dutifully upheld by Wilko Johnson and Dave Edmunds, but these were lone voices of dissent.
The following year was billed as the last ever and saw Steel Pulse canned off after 15 minutes by a typically broad-minded Stranglers crowd and Black Sabbath playing in front of an unfinished replica of Stonehenge.
‘It was too big for the stage,’ remembers Myra.
‘They were sawing it in half and heaving all these rocks around on the Saturday morning trying to make it look like anything other than a total abortion.
In the end we just let the audience in or we'd have been there all day.’
It gave Spinal Tap the inspiration for ‘Stonehenge’, but otherwise the Reading Festival must have barely registered beyond ‘laughing stock’ status in the minds of Barbara's ‘intelligent, discerning’young music fans.
After farmer Desmond Drayton granted use of his fields adjoining the original site, it returned in '86 with a hurriedly assembled bill featuring The Mission, Killing Joke, FM, Saxon, New Model Army, It Bites and Hawkwind, only to confirm that Reading was suffering from a massive non-identity crisis.
That 1971 Genesis contract in full.

The press tent, 1971!
Babes in boyland
Above: what a load of rubbish!
The Reading punters and their resultant detritus.
Inset, right: oh, how the design of those programme flyers improved over the years!
The next year was worse: The Mission, Icicle Works, Fields Of The Nephilim and The Fall on Friday, Status Quo, Quireboys and Magnum on Saturday, and Zodiac Mindwarp, Alice Cooper, FM (again?!) and The Stranglers (again!!!) to close.
Who the hell needed Reading?
Metalheads had Donington, goths had the Electric Ballroom, Stranglers fans had each other and as for the rest, well, too bad.
Something had to give.
IT DIDN'T. 1988 is widely perceived as Reading's nadir, poorly attended and with a woefully average line-up, even by Reading's by now hopeless standards.
Iggy Pop and the lippily ascendant Wonder Stuff aside, the only high point was seeing the pathetic Meat Loaf take umbrage at the traditional hail of plastic bottles.
‘Hey!’ frothed Fatso.
‘Do you wanna rock 'n' roll or do ya wanna throw shit?!’
‘Throw shit!’ came the gleeful response.
After taking a direct hit on the right temple, Mr Loaf walked off and has not graced a British stage since.
He wasn't even headlining.
Starship were headlining.
The following week's press was hard but fair: Reading Festival — A Joke!
Official!
Something gave.
Jake Barrie was relieved of his booking duties and the Mean Fiddler's Dave Phillips was offered the chance to revive the Pendletons' flagging garden party.
He succeeded by dint of the radical policy of booking bands that were vaguely contemporary, at least moderately interesting and which common sense along suggested would pull a respectable crowd.
The House Of Love, The Sugarcubes, New Order, The Pogues, Jesus Jones, Butthole Surfers…
Suddenly Reading was the Glastonbury you could go to and still be able to catch the last train home.
‘We knew we should change but we were too slow,’ admits Barbara.
‘What was disappointing about '88 was the audience.
I couldn't believe people could be so intolerant.’
Reading's renaissance was underpinned by the even greater success of '90 and '91.
Indeed, after years of benign neglect, the job of booking acts for Reading became every promoter's dream.
Earlier this year the Mean Fiddler's Vince Power and the Pendleton organisation failed to reach agreement on negotiating a new three-year contract and Paul McAvoy, booking manager at the Marquee, got the nod instead.
‘The Mean Fiddler’ did a brilliant job,’says McAvoy.
‘They turned Reading round after that debacle in '88, and at the time I was very surprised that Vince didn't accept the new contract because it's become such a prestigious event.
But he's had his own little campaign to rubbish it now, just because he hasn't got it any more.
I was at the Madness gig at Finsbury Park the other week and Vince had me removed from the premises!
It's so childish of him — any argument he's got is with the organisers, not me.’
Five years ago the prospect of music biz power-brokers scraping over the rights to the Reading Festival would have been laughable, but then five years ago Reading was laughable, light years removed from the vital, fun, rather homely popstravaganza it is today.
Future promoters should think well on that before choosing any dramatic alterations to its current make-up.
‘The audiences are so young now,’ says Myra, ‘lots of 16-year-olds.
The metal crowd were really quite ancient but now we've got a mum monitor who answers the phone and reassures all the mums that their little ones are going to be OK.’
‘You'll find the only people who complain are usually gentlemen with very little hair,’ adds Barbara, herself a young-at-heart 57, ‘and they're complaining about these young people with lots of hair!
That's always been the case, it's only in recent years that young people have been allowed to go out and enjoy themselves.
In my day, you went to school, then you went to work.
And we rebelled against that, I suppose.’
I'll see you down the front.
THIS ISN'T A JOKE EITHER!

1988 again: The cool sophistication of John Hiatt is always a festival favourite
PISSED…
OFF!
I had every reason to look forward to the August Bank Holiday weekend of 1988.
Still virginal in my dealings with the music press, I was to be despatched to the Reading Festival to cover this bastion of the British rock calendar for NME .
Strong drink and vibrant tunes in the open air, I stupidly thought.
How wrong I was.
The Reading Festival of 1988 was the worst music-related experience I have ever had, or ever expect to have.
It was a celebration of all that is ugly and pointless about pop culture; flaccid, unimaginative, shallow, a lifestyle celebration for people without a lifestyle, a mundane parade of talentless cretins performing their laughable music for the amusement of the most appalling heap of detritus I've ever seen assembled in one place.
It was a nightmare from the word go.
That kind of damp, chill August day only Blighty can produce, a large, scrubby field, a bill that could make you weep it was so poor.
Contrary to popular belief, rock journalists aren't only interested in backstage hospitality.
But, for reasons that will become clear, the backstage facilities at Reading '88 attained a special importance.
It was somewhere to hide and sob into your plastic glass of flat lager while all around, pondlife ran riot.
Backstage was misery.
Ageing HM clowns with bottle tans and painted on black jeans held court at the wretched bar surrounded by sagging, middle-aged groupies who'd made themselves up whilst drunk, it appeared.
‘Comedian’ Keith Allen was much in evidence in this company, he was a star of Kylie-esque proportions.
A handful of poxy tents sold greasy lentil pilaf to the worst kind of industry lackey.
Out front, it was even worse.
From the word go the crowd (badly dressed, smelly, blank-faced and radiating tragedy) greeted the bands with abuse and bottles of cider which they had feverishly pissed in.
There were some moments of grim humour.
Both The Quireboys and Bonnie Tyler (See!
 F—ing top quality entertainment, eh kids) took direct hits to the head and upper body which they tried to laugh off with some misplaced jokes.
Runrig played for 12 hours.
I got into a fight with a man whose IQ was so low, it took him ten minutes to say ‘press wanker’.
Modern parents encouraged their runtish children to start small fires and shit in the burger van queue.
Uriah Heep didn't play any of their good songs.
Meat Loaf came on to a volley of missiles and for one, beautiful moment, it seemed he was going to get down from the stage and beat some arsehole to death.
Sadly, he didn't.
He sloped off whining instead.
Finally, the local chapter of Hell's Angels invaded the site and the security fled.
I pleaded with Gripper and Skull to be allowed to join the chapter on a one-off basis but they refused.
Enraged, drunk, freezing and unutterably miserable I left to make the 200 mile trip home.
My subsequent review was severely edited by the then Live Ed Helen Mead.
With hindsight, she was right.
The stuff about ‘wretched human tampons’ was a tad strong.
But the tone of hatred remained.
And the piece was all the better for it.
I'm told that Reading is a different place now.
But, frankly, I don't have the stomach to find out.
Basically I had the wrong equipment at Reading '88.
I took a notebook.
It should have been a flamethrower.

As ‘Nevermind’ zoomed past Bono and Jacko, so the rumours started: Kurt Is Dead…
Kurt and Courtney and heroin…
As the bulldozers continue to gather up the money, will NIRVANA survive the madness of mega-success?
But more to the point, will they survive Courtney Love?

15 minutes of frame: STEVE DOUBLE
Imagine a wedding without a bride and groom.
Or a banquet without the food, a candle without a flame, a film without a star.
A mother without a child.
It's not right — it's not ready.
It can't happen.
They aren't here yet.
So, somewhere deep in the pristine recesses of Madrid's Velodrome, we have to wait.
And wait.
Hey, don't worry, we've got really good at waiting over the last couple of days.
Have a coffee, eat some food, do a little pacing up and down.
Oh yes — waiting, we know how to do it.
There's a slight commotion in the distance and all eyes turn at once.
Here they come!
She leads him by the hand, and from a distance they resemble those drawings of Christopher Robin dragging Winnie The Pooh along the ground.
As they get nearer, though, the vision fades.
Christopher Robin was never this female, never this pregnant, and Pooh never wore such a sappy grin or had a blood red lipstick welt on his right cheek.
She looks angry.
He looks cute.
Everyone else looks relieved.
Ladeeez an' gennullmen …
I give you King Kurt and Queen Courtney, newly crowned monarchs of the former Republic of Nirvana.
Pray silence for Her Majesty!
‘Here he is!’ she shrieks.
‘Here's everyone's little investment!’
God, don't you just hate royalty and their bad jokes?
I HADN'T seen Nirvana since December '91, when they'd played the Transmusicales Festival in Rennes, France.
It was the band's last date before cancelling the rest of their European tour due to Kurt Cobain's ravaged voice and, although messy in places, their performance still heaved with a sometimes dangerous, sometimes carefree sense of abandon, enough to be a vivid reminder of just why this band had meant more than any other for years.
In the dressing-room afterwards, all were exhausted.
Chris Novoselic rolled a cigarette with the deliberate, weary motions of a man three times his age, while Dave Grohl sat motionless for ten minutes with a towel over his head, every now and again moaning, ‘I think I'm about to die’.
Kurt, however, was remarkably animate, clearly happy it was all over, and talked enthusiastically about how much he'd enjoyed touring with Shonen Knife and was now just looking forward to going home for a rest.
Considering his band had clocked up four months on a promotional treadmill that had become steeper and faster the more ‘Nevermind’ sold, he looked in pretty good shape.
See you next year, Kurt.
He smiled.
‘Sure.’
Next year turned this year, ‘Nevermind’ zoomed past Jacko, Bono and Axl.
Nirvana did Saturday Night Live , the Rolling Stone front cover, landed the Reading Festival headline slot, the whole shebang, and suddenly ghoulish rumours concerning the health — physical and otherwise — of the frail genius at the centre of what was now the Nirvana Phenomenon started to become commonplace.
It got harder to laugh at the weekly brace of ‘Kurt Is Dead’ stories when various credible sources were whispering about Cobain and partner Courtney Love doing heroin together, about them being completely out of it all at their wedding in Hawaii, about them going into detox and then quitting.
About how the band were on the verge of splitting up.
About Courtney doing junk while pregnant…
As far as the tabloid music press were concerned, Nirvana were just too good to be true.
Rarely had the rollercoaster dynamic of rock 'n' roll been so extreme — unknowns shoot from nowhere to top of charts with incendiary musical formula.
The all-important twist?
They didn't even try!
They don't want to be successful!
Brilliant.
And now, with the accountants still hiring bulldozers to gather up the money, they've begun to blow it all via smack, the biggest sucker punch of the lot.
From nobodies to superstars to  f—ups in the space of six months?!
That had to be a record.
Nirvana Inc battened down the hatches and made to ride out the storm.
It was business as usual.
The band were taking a break from each other, but they'd be working on some new material soon with a view to releasing a new song as a single to coincide with Reading.
Everything was fine, really it was.
During this rest period I interviewed Chris by telephone and asked him how the wedding of the year had gone.
‘Oh, quiet.’
Masterful diplomacy.
Chris in fact hadn't been at the wedding, since Courtney had refused to let his wife Shelli attend.
Meanwhile, Kurt repeatedly and vehemently denied taking heroin.
As stonewalls go, this was all highly impressive.
Sure, the rumours continued, but while Nirvana weren't actually doing anything it wasn't hard to dismiss this as nothing more than the idle tittle-tattle that was the inevitable lot of a multi-million selling rock band.
Then came the time to really pick up the slack once more.
A two week tour of Europe was organised for late-June/July in order to make up for the shows cancelled at the end of last year.
After the gig at Belfast King's Hall, Kurt was rushed to hospital suffering from acute stomach pains.
‘Ulcers,’ sez Nirvana.
‘Oh yeah,’ yawns everyone else.
Could so much have changed in six months?
Moving round the archways of Valencia's bull-ring where, that night, Nirvana would give Spain its first in-the-flesh taste of what this nonsense was all about, it was almost a relief to greet Kurt Cobain once again, a paler, bleached-haired, bespectacled Kurt Cobain, but recognisably the same lovable scruff who late last year turned rock 'n' roll upside down with a song named after a deodorant.
Chris Novoselic ambled up to say ‘hi’ and bemoan a chronic hangover — the inevitable punishment for a late-night sesh with support band Teenage Fanclub — and Dave Grohl soon emerged from down the rampway that led to the sun-baked arena, all smiles as ever.
Hmmm, I thought.
This doesn't seem so bad.
OK, so I've never seen Kurt look quite that pale before, and I'm not sure it's such a good idea for Courtney to be zipping about with Kurt on that hired motorbike while seven months pregnant but, hell, it's not as if anyone's dead.
No-one is dead.
That much we can take away from this latest close encounter with planet Nirvana without fear of contradiction.
But death — specifically heroin-induced — has been a talking point amidst US underground circles recently.
During the New Music Seminar, NYC noise harbingers Unsane lost their drummer Charlie Ondras to an overdose, then the following week Stefanie Sargent from Seattle band Seven Year Bitch died in similar circumstances.
What year did you say it was?
WE ARE SITTING in one of Nirvana's dressing rooms after the taming of the bullring.
By Nirvana's standards, it's been pretty lacklustre stuff, but the crowd didn't seem to mind.
Kurt is showing me his glasses which, along with his new hairstyle, are supposed to enable him to walk down the street unrecognised.
I suggest that people will most likely stare at him anyway.
‘You're probably right.’
Chris and Steve Double are talking cameras, the bassman's current pet hobby, while Dave dispenses beers and chats to Anton, Nirvana's UK press guy.
Courtney Love, meanwhile, is sounding off to anyone within earshot about Stefanie Sargent.
For the record, Courtney's current reading material is 12 Days On The Road , the recently published account of the Sex Pistols' fatal American tour.
‘People say she was a junkie but how do they know that?
I mean, I don't think if you do it once or twice it means you're hooked, that's not a junkie.
And if you have someone with you, too, that's good.
She was alone, though, you know that?
Still, it's sooo rock.’
Spend two days in tour fatigues with this new, arena-compatible Nirvana production machine —‘I don't know the names of most of the crew,’ admits Dave — and it dawns on you that the overriding issue here is not that Kurt Cobain is on heroin (or isn't, or was, or is and is trying to get off) but that his wife is a Grade A pain in the arse.
She seems to be almost universally disliked.
‘The Wicked Witch Of The West,’ is one crew member's assessment, while someone else refers to Kurt being a nice guy BC —‘Before Courtney’.
Any impression of calm and harmony is down to the fact that everyone close to the band has obviously passed the Krypton Factor -sponsored How To Tolerate Courtney test.
Chris and Shelli simply ignore her.
The irrepressible Dave alternates that approach with some impressive mimic routines.
During the Valencia show, Courtney is sitting on the stage, near Grohl's kit.
‘Courtney!’ he screams in mock petulance, ‘Get the  f— off my stage!’
It's just the sort of thing Courtney would say.
A recent addition to the Nirvana entourage is Janet Billig, who looked after Hole's affairs in her previous employ at Caroline Records.
Her role on this tour is like a cross between wet nurse and human sponge, indulging whims and soaking up all of Courtney's excess bullshit.
One of the reasons for her unpopularity could be because right now she — and only she — has the full confidence of Kurt Cobain, the man without whom Nirvana can't function.
As demonstrated by their regal entrance prior to the Madrid show, Courtney is only too well aware of this.
For much of that day, everything is put on hold — Nirvana's soundcheck, interviews, the NME picture session, Teenage Fanclub's soundcheck, everything — because Kurt isn't around, still holed up with the missus back at the hotel.
Anton repeatedly tries to speak to him but, on the one occasion when the phone gets picked up, Courtney yells ‘He's asleep!’ and slams it down again.
Eventually she lets Anton talk to Kurt, who seems unaware of all the fuss.
After four hours of waiting, Steve gets a 15 minute photo-shoot.
There is no Nirvana soundcheck.
The Fanclub's Gerry Love casts Nirvana's hassled tour manager Alex a sympathetic look.
‘There is no way,’ he states firmly, ‘we're ever gonna let it end up like this.’
WHETHER HEROIN is at the root of this unreliability I don't know for sure, nor am I about to proscribe the freedom — or is that stupidity — of anyone to take whatever substance they choose to take, be it alcohol, tobacco, heroin or carpet cleaner.
But the fact is that Courtney's dealing the hand of an unborn baby as well as her own.
The health of little Frances Bean Cobain is the X factor that elevates all this second-hand scandal into something a whole lot scarier, something much more important.
She doesn't have a choice.
The most recent scare story concerning Nirvana involves Courtney being admitted to hospital in Bilbao — Nirvana's final port of call before heading back to the US — having damaged her womb.
She is advised to stay there for five days but insists on going back with the band.
Then Kurt has to shell out a considerable amount of money, maybe $25,000, for the first class plane seats so that Courtney can fly home lying down and a specially appointed ambulance to pick her up at LA airport.
OK, another story, another rumour, but who'd take the trouble to make this stuff up?
This is serious shit, and it's no wonder some people are freaking out and saying reading will be it.
Game Over.
The End.
And all because this cool band sells a supertanker load of records!
That's the disconcertingly prosaic truth of the matter.
In Spain, about the only times when things got put in this much perspective were when Nirvana were actually playing — Madrid was still below-par, frenzy-wise, but a thrilling experience purely because the audience was so enthused by it all — and when I finally interviewed Dave, Chris and Kurt.
Away from the panic, the waiting, the torn-up schedules, hell, it seemed almost like old times, almost normal.
‘Petty tour drama can be an ordeal,’ considers Dave.
‘People have tantrums, people's tempers flare.
But I can block everything out.
I'm not really an emotional person at all, just because I'd rather ignore emotion than confront it, so when it comes down to really heavy shit it kinda just breezes right by me.
I don't really want to get involved in anyone else's problems and I don't want to be the cause of anyone else's, so I just lay low.
I think maybe that's what'll keep me sane through this whole trip.’
What causes the madness?
A Spanish fan reaches Nirvana…
Nirvana reach a (S) pain in the ass
‘Cute’ Kurt onstage at the Madrid Velodrome: a man ‘unmoved by the experience of playing rock 'n' roll’
‘Just constant gratification is unhealthy for anybody, y'know?
This is why you've got people like Michael Jackson and Axl Rose, Insane Rock Star A or B, because they're constantly being pampered.
I've tried to keep some level of consideration for everybody through this whole  thing.
I don't like to have people do stuff for me.
I don't like to have runners to out and get me meals, I don't like to call down to room service and ask them to bring me up some cigarettes — it's just not normal.
That's the kind of thing that will get to you and make a difference in eight months of being in a popular band with a lot of money.
It's gross.’
Dave's closest brush with a total gratification zone came when he met Bono on U2's recent American tour.
‘ F—in' asshole!
It was such a bummer 'cos when I was 13 I thought ‘War’ was a great album!
He reeks of rock-star-ness, he was not a human being.
He wanted us to open up for them on tour, and I said, ‘No, that's not what we're into’.
And he was saying, ‘You owe it to the audience, you've got to take that next step.’
And I said ‘I don't wanna take that next step!’
He was desperately trying to make a connection.
‘Do you like the blues?’
‘No.’
‘Do you like gospel?’
‘Er, no, not really.’
‘So what kind of music do you listen to?’
‘Punk  f—in' rock, man!’
And then of course he tells me about punk rock and he was there and he was the meaning of punk rock.
After meeting that guy it made me wanna give up being in a rock 'n' roll band.’
Chris Novoselic reckons he's got his priorities sorted.
After this tour's finished, he's off to Croatia to see his family, who live in Zadar, about 250 miles up the coast from Dubrovnik.
‘I try to have humility about things, just be for real.
'Cos all of this is fabricated.
People, they build these institutions like governments or rock bands or anything, and reality is distorted.
Some people are worried about eating and here we are off on this whole rock 'n' roll circus.
I have to take it with a grain of salt.’
Has it changed the way you feel about Dave and Kurt?
‘No, it's pretty much the same as it always was, just pretty laid-back.
We spent some time away from each other just to do our own things, but now we're looking forward to getting back to how things were, lock ourselves away and work.
Our new record's just gotta sound different.
I've been on this big rant lately of how transition is natural, continental drift, the seasons, the weather's different every day, people grow older and change…
When I think of ‘Nevermind’ now I think of interviews and being famous.
Now I'm focusing on this new record and not even considering anything that's happened, and maybe we can come out absolved.’
He laughs.
‘I see this as such a rite of passage — you get signed to a major, you get money, you go into the studio, a big 24-track hubbub, either it sells or it doesn't.
And ours sold, but that's all behind us now.
All the records we've sold have given us the power to do whatever we want.’
Is he worried about Kurt?
‘You hear all the rumours.
Just media bullshit.
You gotta have a good story.’
But there's usually no smoke without fire.
‘Yeah.’
Silence.
‘Yessirree.’
A sigh.
‘And after the fire, the fire still burns…
But there's freedom of speech.
What if you walked into a crowded theatre and yelled ‘Fire!’
Is that freedom of speech?’
I should hope so.
Sometimes there's an excess of freedom.
‘Yeah, there is, isn't there?
People lose perspective on things.
Which is really easy to do in artificial environments.
You just accept it.
Today I'm here in Madrid and that's just what's goin' on.
There's a light at the end of the tunnel.
This is my reality, it's what I have to do.’
BY THE time I get to see Kurt, it's over an hour after the show's finished.
I'm watching Chris and Dave fool around at a disc presentation ceremony, a routine they're well versed in by now, and talking kilt tartans to Matt Cameron from Soundgarden, who were due to play here with Guns N' Roses the following night but the gig's been cancelled.
Anton tells me I can have 20 minutes and then he's sending the other two on to finish things off.
He doesn't make it clear whether these are the only terms to which Kurt would agree to do an interview.
It's pretty obvious that Kurt Cobain has been running on reserve tanks for most of this Euro-jaunt.
Never have I seen him so static onstage, so apparently unmoved by the whole experience of playing rock 'n' roll.
The contrast is made all the more poignant by the ‘Lithium’ promo vid and its scenes of psyched-up mayhem from last year's Reading.
‘Yeah, last year's shows were way better,’ he nods.
‘I don't think we've had a along enough break.
I'm still not enjoying it as much as I should.
According to our manager and most of the people we work with, the break that we had was too long.
Everyone wants us to work and work all the time and not stop.
It was only four months of relaxation and I really needed that.
I've come to a lot of conclusions about myself within the last four months.
I've learned to accept the fact of being a rock star and how big the band's become.
I can at least deal with it, I'm not as pissed off as I was.
It's still…
I dunno.
I'm such a picky person that everything has to be perfect.’
Does it feel like you created something that's got to be broken down now?
‘Well, it's a bit embarrassing to play in front of kids who wear Skid Row T-shirts, y'know?’ he chuckles.
‘It's really hard to overcome that, to just shake it off and say, ‘Oh well, they're just dumb kids, maybe they'll throw away their Skid Row records and listen to Mudhoney because of us…’ but that story's old.
I'm tired of talking about ‘the underground’!
‘I've never claimed to be a punk rocker, I've just claimed to have liked punk rock music.
I'd like to be a rhythm guitar player in a band!
No-one realises how  f—in' hard it is to scream at the top of your lungs and concentrate on playing guitar solos.
We're actually thinking of getting Buzz from The Melvins in to play guitar with us live.
It's still not gonna relive me of my vocal duties, though.’
Oh, yes Kurt, but the band wouldn't be the same if you didn't sing.
‘No, I know that.’
He laughs.
‘Well maybe I could start another band.
I'm thinking of doing that, actually, with Mark Arm and Eric from Hole.
But then, I'm so lazy with this band I couldn't imagine being in two bands at once.
Jesus!’
It sounds like you'd like to escape from the limelight.
Does it get you down to read every week that you're a heroin addict?
‘Yeah, it does get to me, it pisses me off.
I had no idea that being in a commercial rock band would be like this, because I've never paid attention to other commercial rock bands.
I've never read a U2 interview so I don't know if there are rumours about them doing insane things.
I'm not really aware of any other rock band that have had so many rumours written about them.
Guns N’ Roses went into it admitting stuff, trying to create something, same with Jane's Addiction.
who totally flaunted it, totally glamorised heroin use.
I think that's ridiculous.’
There then follows the weirdest episode of a pretty weird two days.
I've just asked Kurt whether the heroin rumours are true — to which he's laughed, said ‘No!’ and made me feel his arms for any tell-tale scars or holes, though obviously shooting up isn't the only way to take smack and to be honest I'm not sure I knew what I was meant to be looking for, but still, it's an impressive gesture at the very least — when Anton walks in with a woman I recognise as Susan Silver, manager of Soundgarden.
She waves at Kurt, says, ‘I just wanna say goodnight,’ then sits down next to him.
Anton tells me to turn the tape machine off.
Why?
‘Just turn it off!’
As well as being a sweet guy, Anton's a useful Thai boxer and he's got these dogs, see…
So off it goes.
Susan talks intently to Kurt, looking directly into his eyes, the gist of it being just call me if there's anything you want, then she and Anton leave.
Erm, Kurt, about what you were saying…
‘See!
She thinks I'm on heroin!’ he whispers excitedly.
‘She does!
Didn't you see it in her eyes?
And I've heard it from a whole bunch of people, she says stuff, she actually tells people I'm on heroin all the time.
That's Soundgarden's manager, it goes from the  f—in' highest level of people in the music industry down to the street punk kids.’
MAKE OF all this what you will.
Perhaps I was naive enough to suppose that, when you've sold as many records as Nirvana have, it would convey power, a means by which the band could control their own destiny.
And maybe it has but it also seems to have raised the stakes unhelpfully, even dangerously high.
Maybe I'm reading too much into little things, maybe it's all as petty as Dave says and maybe I'm just fearing the worst.
Frankly, having spent two days looking at how different it is for Nirvana right now — or rather, how it was six weeks ago — I found it difficult not to.
No, look, Reading'll be great, just the boost they need.
They can still do it, you know.
Put Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl and Chris Novoselic on a stage or in a rehearsal space or in a studio and they can still wreak magic, the three losers who took on the world and won.
And once the baby's born everyone's bound to calm down and take stock of things, realise what's important in life.
Because that's all it is, after all, it's only life.
Dave: ‘Did you know if you take the ‘N’ and the ‘D’and the first ‘E’out of‘Nevermind’it spells ‘vermin’?
Chris: ‘Mmm.’
Kurt.
‘Wow.’
It seems like one million years BC (Before Courtney)
No future?
Nirvana away from the petty tour drama (and drama queens): Chris Novoselic, Kurt ‘Mr Disguise’ Cobain and Dave Grohl
DIE FLAYED ALIVE!
Many reckon the swinging '60s ended the night followers of deranged hippy guru CHARLES MANSON broke into the house of Roman Polanski and brutally murdered its occupants — including Polanski's pregnant young wife Sharon Tate.
Since then a huge influence on sicko rockers everywhere, the whole gory story has been re-cast as a full-blown opera — The Manson Family.
EDWIN POUNCEY, naturally, had to investigate…
Now is the time…for ‘Helter Skelter’, hippy cult leader Charles Manson ordered four of his Family on the fateful and fear-filled night of August 8, 1969.
It was a command that would result in the slaying of actress of Sharon Tate (who was pregnant with film director Roman Polanski's child at the time of her fatal stabbing), coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her lover Wojiciech Frykowski, delivery boy Steven Earl Parent and Hollywood hair stylist to the stars, Jay Sebring.
Manson's hand-picked ‘death squad’ for this murderous mission was made up of Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkiel, Linda Kasabian (who would later turn witness for the prosecution at the controversial trial that followed) and Tex Watson who, when asked by a terrified Frykowski who he was, calmly replied, ‘I am the devil, and I am here on the devil's business.’
When all five victims were stabbed or shot to death, Susan Atkins dipped a towel in Sharon Tate's blood and daubed the single word ‘Pig’ on the living-room door.
Manson was so pleased with the ensuing panic that rippled through Hollywood after the murders were discovered that he organised another raid, this time with himself as the leader.
As well as the four responsible for the Tate slayings, Manson also invited Family members Clem Gorgan and Leslie Van Houten to join in the fun.
Sky high on hallucinogenics, they descended upon the home of 47-year-old supermarket boss Leno LaBianca, who was at home with his wife Rosemary.
Both received multiple fatal stab wounds and, as in the Tate case, the walls of the LaBianca apartment were daubed, this time with the words ‘Death To Pigs’, ‘Rise’ and ‘ Healter Skelter’(sic ) in the victims' blood.
THE TATE/LaBIANCA killings shocked America and the world.
It was felt that Manson and his Family had not only been responsible for the death of seven people, but also for the death of innocence, and suddenly hippies weren't cute or funny any more.
As the media went rabid with outrage, a for and against Manson/Family industry began to boom.
Suddenly, sleazy accounts of the murders appeared in book form, Manson's image was plastered on the covers of such respected magazines as Life and Rolling Stone , Manson T-shirts, bumper stickers and recordings of his songs were available everywhere, and it seemed that the bizarre element of the Family's life and crimes had captured the imagination of both freaks and straight society.
Manson was, and remains to this day, America's number one bogeyman and is regularly pilloried and looked on in fascination by a world that still can't believe such things happened.
Before the Tate/LaBianca murders happened, however, Charles Manson was attempting to make it as a rock star.
He had already convinced Beach Boy Dennis Wilson of his musical powers and had plans to make an LP, which he hoped to release on a major record label.
Then there was Manson's fascination with the music of The Beatles which, he was convinced, somewhat derangedly, was peppered with secret personal messages for his ears only.
It is this element of Charlie that has perhaps made him popular with other (albeit less twisted) musicians.
Amongst the many who have paid tribute to Charlie are Sonic Youth, Anthrax, Neil Young, Throbbing Gristle and a host of guitarcore grungemeisters who have incorporated the Manson look into their image or current product.
The latest musical Manson statement, however, is not a three-minute thrash song or a badly recorded ‘smuggled’ prison tape from the man himself, currently locked up in San Quentin, but a full-blown opera entitled The Manson Family by New York composer John Moran.
Moran's opera concentrates on the Family's life together at the remote Spahn Ranch, the Tate murders and Manson's subsequent trial, all of which is delivered in an impressionistic style with no real narrative structure to hold the separate elements of the tale together.
The result is a wild, and sometimes very scary, portrait of Manson, his teachings and his bad craziness; a look from behind those piercing cold eyes as the listener to Moran's opera is suddenly given an expressway journey to the back of Charlie's skull.
INTRIGUED BY John Moran's project, we discussed it in more depth.
I was half expecting some serious, mumbling classical music type, but instead I found an intelligent and lively personality whose last opera was a portrait of American comedian Jack Benny.
Is there a connection between Jack Benny and Charles Manson, by any chance?
Is  The Manson Family a sequel perhaps?
‘Well, they didn't live far apart,’ laughs John.
‘Actually, that was the first thing that made somebody show me something about Manson, when I was wondering who Jack Benny's neighbours might have been.
Somebody said, well a few years later it was Charles Manson and I said, who?
When I was a kid (Moran was born in 1965 ) I knew the name, I knew it was someone scary, but I didn't really know anything about the story or how  exactly wild things really were.’
Did you have to do a lot of research?
‘I did a lot of research into what the characters were like, I wasn't so much interested in the facts of the case of the dates and specifics, but, I actually got to know Susan Atkins pretty well, one of the Family members who is now in prison.
She's actually a really nice woman and she took a lot of time to really explain to me what was going on with her at that time.
I was really surprised at how down to earth she was, I didn't really know what to expect, but she granted me interviews and I don't think she has ever granted an interview from prison before.’
How about Charlie, does he know about The Manson Family ?
‘I'm sure he does, yeah.
The Wall Street Journal gave the opera a bad review when it was performed at Lincoln Centre.
I didn't see that review but evidently they called Charlie a creep.
Manson saw that somehow and decided to write them a letter because he didn't like being called a creep.
That became a famous story, where they almost cancelled the record because they thought the Manson Family were after them or something!
It didn't make a lot of sense.’
SUCH CREEPY-crawly paranoia, however, is at the heart of Moran's vision of the Family at work and slay.
In his youth, I discover, he too was sucked into a hippy cult that was dominated by a leader with suggestive powers.
‘It was a really strange group who were devoted to (famous psychologist ) Carl Jung.
It was very different from the Manson Family in that no drugs were allowed, and no orgies or anything were going on.
It was called the Psychological Club, but basically it was all centred around this one very strange guy who had interpreted Jung's teachings in a very strange way.
It was about how the unconscious was taking over and the Revelations were coming down…
It's probably kind of true!’
Were you controlled in any way?
‘Oh completely, absolutely.
Me and all my friends ended up in this cult and the first thing this guy said we had to do was turn all of our friendships against each other so that we couldn't trust anybody.
Isolation is basic cult tactics, especially isolation from any of your old friends.
We all worked and lived at the same place and it seemed pretty cool to me at the time, but it started to become more and more negative until it got to the point where I wanted to leave…and I realised that they wouldn't let me!
I was 19, that's about the same age as most of the Manson group were.’
For the recording of his The Manson Family , Moran decided to take on the role of Charlie himself, his unsettling experience with the Psychological Club being, perhaps, influential to his chilling performance.
‘I don't really look like Manson at all,’ he admits, ‘but I just felt that I could do it best!
I wanted to have that control in the studio, being able to step in at any moment.’
Did you have to psych yourself up for the part?
‘I did, but at the same time I felt like I understood Manson because, maybe in a superficial way, I felt like I naturally spoke like him.
I'm from Nebraska and he's from Kentucky and the accent is fairly similar, we both have very nasal accents and I just pushed this as a musical thing.’
The other main performance to listen out for on The Manson Family is Iggy Pop's characterisation of prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi who, for artistic reasons, Moran has chosen to re-christen Jack Lord, the name of the actor who played suave and sophisticated TV detective Steve McGarrett on Hawaii Five-O .
What gives, John?
‘Hawaii Five-O was a hit show while the Manson Family was on trial, and before that it was a really drab, boring FBI kind of show.
Then suddenly, when Manson was in the headlines, as popular shows do, they said, we've gotta keep up with the times and Hawaii Five-O went super psychedelic.
They started chasing after all these hippy cult groups and all the criminals were on drugs.
I thought it was a good analogy to how Manson had affected the country, how he had really wedged himself into the American family to the extent that he's now on the country's most popular TV show.
I also thought that there was a certain similarity in the way Steve McGarrett and Vincent Bugliosi tried to present themselves.’
And how did you get on working with Iggy Pop?
‘He's a very, very nice guy,’ enthuses John.
‘We actually wrote some pop songs together at that time, it was fun.’
THE OTHER reason for tuning into Moran's Manson opera is to hear how he has deformed the music of The Beatles to fit inside the mad brain of Charlie.
‘I thought that one of the most interesting things about the Manson case was how they thought that The Beatles were talking to them, and that they thought The Beatles were the four horsemen of the apocalypse mentioned in the Bible.
I really thought that was funny because, once you start listening to their music with that in mind, suddenly almost everything they say starts to become very cryptic.
And of course, being a composer, I think it would be very hard not to have been influenced by The Beatles.’
What about the music of Charles Manson himself, did that have any influence on your opera?
‘I wouldn't say that Charlie's music was a huge influence, he plays guitar in one scene of the opera but never really gets past tuning it.
I didn't figure his playing was very good, it kinda reminded me of Tom Jones (at one point the Family actually targeted Jones —Apocryphal Ed ) a little bit.
Which is funny, because all the Manson girls that I've seen on film and stuff, when they talk about Charlie's music they always say, he was great, he was as good as Tom Jones!
Isn't that weird?’
Weird for sure but, erm…not unusual.
Manson Family composer John Moran: ‘I understood Manson…
I felt like I spoke like him.’
MANSON ON RECORD
CHARLES MANSON AND THE FAMILY: Lie
MANSON'S SOLO LP, featuring songs that he originally presented to Byrds producer Terry Melcher in the hope of landing a major record deal.
Melcher refused and was subsequently put on the Family's death list.
‘Lie’ was finally released by Awareness, a subsidiary of Bernard Stollman's eccentric ESP-Disk.
The sleeve artwork was directly ripped from the infamous Manson/ Life magazine front cover, altered slightly to tell the Family's side of the story.
‘Lie’ has since been bootlegged and reissued on various labels and is still available.
The latest reissue bears a sticker that claims all sales will go to the victims' families.
THE MANSON FAMILY: Sings The Songs Of Charles Manson
PREVIOUSLY UNISSUED creepy-crawly recordings of Charlie's angels crooning the master's songbook.
THE BEACH BOYS: Never Learn Not To Love aka Cease To Exist
WHILE HANGING ten with the Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson (who described Charlie as ‘the magician’), Manson managed to charm him into accepting one of his songs for the band's '20/20’ LP.
Originally titled ‘Cease To Exist’, it appeared on the record (and the B-side of the follow-up 45) as ‘Never Learn Not To Love’.
Manson was, however, not credited on either release.
THE BEATLES: Helter Skelter
THE WEIRD and wild ride off The Beatles' ‘White Album’ was adopted by Manson and the Family as the main battle cry for his crazed cause.
Other artists who have covered the song include Siouxsie And The Banshees and U2…
‘Charles Manson stole this song from The Beatles,’ announces Bono portentously on ‘Rattle & Hum’.
‘We're stealing it back again!’
THE BEATLES: Piggies
AGAIN FROM the Fab Four's ‘White Album’, ‘Piggies’ is a George Harrison song about how useless the human race is.
Manson was suitably impressed and strongly identified with Hari-George's sentiments of disgust.
NEIL YOUNG: Mansion On The Hill
OR ‘MANSON On The Hill’, as some Young aficionados would prefer to interpret it.
This well strange song from Young's great ‘Ragged Glory’ LP is reckoned by many to be an oblique nod in the direction of Charlie.
SONIC YOUTH & LYDIA LUNCH: Death Valley '69
NEW YORK artpunk sonically salutes Charlie with this trippy tribute to the Family's slaughter of the hippy '60s.
RIP!
SUED'S CORNER
They used to be Captain America, until Mr Marvel got the hump and Mr C&A took exception to their logo, now they're called EUGENIUS, Kurt Cobain still likes them a lot and they may well be the new Nirvana of Vaselined Fannies.
IAN McCANN heralds the arrival of the next pop star called Gordon
Lunchtime, Glasgow.
In a city-centre bar, the four members of Eugenius are convening for what they might call work.
Others might call it drinking, smoking, eating, and taking the piss out of each other, but to these lads, these activities are a vital part of the job.
The first to arrive is Gordon Keen.
Gordon is, potentially, the first pop star called Gordon since Sting, and you may have noticed that even Sting doesn't call himself Gordon.
From Gordon's insistence on calling himself Gordon, you can take the inference that he's an easy-going, natural kind of guy, garrulous and unafraid to tell stories that the rest of the band openly mock.
Gordon and I sit at a table as the old  snowys sup their milk stouts and get ready to cross the road to the theatre, where several stars of television are about to perform the fabulous musical My Fair Lady .
We look at the pub clock and wonder where the rest of the band are.
The Gordon looks at the door, and they're outside, stuffing pies and sandwiches down their faces.
It's cheaper than eating here, and when you're the next Nirvana, rather than the current one, every penny counts.
Several mouthfuls later we're all at the same table.
Raymond Boyle, Eugenius’ bassplayer looks like a harder version of Martin Gilks from The Wonder Stuff.
The lanky Ray frittered away last night in a video-game marathon with Roy Lawrence.
Roy is the epitome of the young indie drummer: a mop of faintly dirty-looking hair topping a pale, almost juvenile face.
His Edinburgh roots are freely attacked by the other members, who call the city's fabulous medieval showpiece Spam Castle, claiming that the building cost Edinburgh so much that it couldn't afford anything worth having.
Eugene Kelly, their leader, singer and guitarist, was apparently named after the band.
It's lucky they didn't choose to call themselves Captain America or something silly like that, because it might have proved embarrassing.
The straight-haired, elegant Eugene appears to be the most cerebral member, which is odd since his previous incarnation was as leader of the decidedly bodily Vaselines, a group for whom the term ‘Kings Of Perv-Rock’ might have been invented.
Fortunately, it wasn't.
Eugene isn't drinking today and appears a shade queasy.
Whether you're a fan or not — and God knows other bands have tried to make damn sure you are — you'll know them soon enough.
They've been hyped by Kurt Cobain, who seems to be wearing their logo in almost every picture.
‘We gave Nirvana three dress shirts,’ says Gordon, quizzically.
‘I've never seen the other two wearing them, but Kurt always has one on…wonder if he ever changes it?’
Unfortunately, those shirts are no longer relevant, but more about that later.
Suffice to say that with the patronage of the Teen Spiriters and help from local heroes Teenage Fanclub in the shape of Brendan O'Hare's drumming in the pre-Roy era, Eugenius aren't short of influential friends.
The Nirvana connection was cemented by covers of two Vaselines songs, ‘Molly's Lips’ and ‘Son Of A Gun’, on a Peel session, and Eugene was called onstage by Kurt at Reading last year to sing ‘Molly's Lips’.
Says Eugene modestly, ‘Kurt asked me did I want to go on, and I said ‘Great’, but I shat myself.
Then I got on and saw all those people and thought ‘Hold on, they're just folk’, and I had a really good sing-song.’
‘And a pose,’ says Gordon.
‘And a pose, and an Elvis impression,’ confirms Eugene.
‘When I came off, I said ‘I ran onstage and there was this resounding sound of 30,000 people going ‘Who the  f—'s that?’ to each other!’
THEIR DEBUT album, ‘Oomalamaa’, is a bit of an oddity.
According to Eugene, the band signed to Paperhouse (also the Fannies' first home, surely no coincidence) to make one single, which expanded to a mini-album and wound up being ‘Oomalama’.
It was cut on the run with a small budget and only half the band: Ray arrived about halfway through and Roy joined later.
Hence the fiery, fluid guitars churning sound and sometimes decidedly personal moments (the painful ‘Hot Dog’ is an example) are probably only part of the story.
If this lot really are the new Nirvana, as some would have it, then ‘Oomalama’ is not even their ‘Bleach’.
That's not to say that it's not worth listening to: it clearly is, and it grows larger the more you hear it.
But it is probably not an exact representation of what today's Eugenius are about.
Think of it as an introduction; a statement of intent.
‘We were writing songs under pressure,’ explains Eugene.
‘We had time booked, songs were arranged in the studio and I was writing lyrics on the day they sang them.
When you look back you can see what's wrong with it.
But there's no way you can get round it with the way it was recorded.’
Gordon eats a pub lunch, meticulously coating everything in brown sauce, salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon juice to the amusement of all.
When he's eaten, we amble out into a grey Glasgow afternoon and head for the Kelvingrove gallery and museum, a £2 taxi ride.
Eventually we drift out into the leafy park behind the museum.
Eugene remembers playing football here with various Pastels (Eugene's first ‘name’ band), Norman from the Fannies, and Bobby Gillespie, who he recalls as a good, surprisingly hard player.
We sit on a bench beneath a tree as the sky begins to spit cool rain.
People wander by with dogs of both varieties: devil and angelic.
Pigeons pester for food, and a squirrel comes up, drawn by the rustle of Rizlas.
We talk about how the band seemed to arrive from nowhere, and Eugene says: ‘I think we got too much attention too early on.
I wish we'd had time to work on things.
We seemed to get press really easily…‘
Don't go blaming us.
‘You buggers done it!
No, it started at our first show in Glasgow, and then we got support slots with Mudhoney before we were a developed band.
We were just guys going at it, playing some of my songs.’
‘We got offered a lot of European dates after Reading,’ says Gordon, ‘but we backed off to rehearse and then went to America.
Now the rhythm section's so strong and permanent, we can almost deconstruct the songs and create more space in what we're doing.’
That trip to America was a minor fiasco.
The two headlining dates sold out on the strength of Kurt Cobain's influential praise, and the ‘Flame On’ single sold heavily on the college campuses.
Unfortunately, it all happened so fast that they cancelled the sold-out dates because they simply couldn't get their work permits in time.
The tour was a shock to the system, particularly Gordon's: back home afterwards, his doctor told him he had a damaged liver.
Gordon would have failed the audition that Roy passed; introduced to Eugenius by the ‘Oomalama’ engineer, the drummer proved his mettle not by thumping tubs but sinking pints.
‘He didn't know,’ smirks Gordon, ‘but we knew he'd got the job when he didn't throw up.’
And I got a round in,’ protests the multi-talented Roy.
EUGENIUS WERE then called Captain America, which is why Kurt's shirts are an anachronism.
Named after a famous comic superhero, the band were threatened with legal action by Marvel Comics, who owned the copyright.
‘We chose the worst  f—in' year to do that,’ laments Gordon.
‘It's Captain America's big birthday in 1992, 50 years or something, so we were the last thing Marvel wanted around.
The thing came right from the top of the company.
when we played CBGB's this guy who's some sort of junior manager for Marvel came up afterwards and said he really liked the band and that it was a shit thing they sued us.’
‘For half an hour it was scary and now it seems funny,’ says Gordon.
Likewise, Captain America were also threatened by C&A, of all people, who felt that the band's logo was an infringement of copyright.
Hence ‘Flame On’ came as both a picture and plain-sleeved single.
‘We've gotta be the only band in history to be sued by a comics company and a clothing company,’ says Eugene, wryly.
They're now determined never to buy their clothes at C&A.
I suggest that Converse might be interested in their star logo, a kind of Captain America hangover, but it might be worse…they do know that there was a '50s band called Eugenius, who cut two LPs for RCA?
‘You're jokin'!’ splutters Gordon, and they crack up.
Well, there was Euphoria, who made an album before one of them had a sex-change.
Ask them what they think about being called the new Nirvana of Vaselined Fannies and they shrug, offering the usual lines about comparisons being inevitable.
‘I think we're moving more left-field while the Fanclub are going more right-field, more melodic and Countryish,’ says Gordon.
 ‘They're like The Eagles while we're like Eddie & The Hot Rods…‘
Oomalama!
And, with one B flat chord, Eugenius save rock'n'roll!
I can see the NME cover now.
Or maybe not.
They're just too sincere and clever to be ruined like the ‘Rods.
Besides which, they don't sound anything like them.
The Nirvana comparisons are equally askew, and they're not as retro as the Fannies.
Already they've got people willing to fly from LA to New York to see them, and people going to every date of their domestic tours.
I suppose there's always nutters about, but there is something special about the band, and I don't just mean their liability to lawsuits.
We walk back through the park and disperse: tonight they're going to a party, it's Paul from The Soup Dragons’ birthday.
Doubtless several Fannies will be there, mebbe a Primal, a Mary Chain.
Mebbe one day Eugenius will be the biggest of the lot.
It's about time we had a pop star called Gordon again.

REVIEWED BY STEVEN WELLS
PURE: Greedy — The Morphine Mix
I thought I'd hate this.
PURE: one word, four letters — almost a guarantee a band are going to be SHIT.
WRONG.
This has a shuffling joss-sticky booga-booga spook beat and a strange haircut;this is the record that Pop Will Eat Itself have been trying to make for the past 24 months, the grinning idiot love-child of Mr Desmond Drugmusic and Mrs Winnie Indiewhine brought up in a radical lesbian commune in Vancouver, Canada and fed on a diet of black pudding and Ecstasy.
If I were to tell you that this record puts a dayglo platform DM so far up the mule's rectum that its entrails squish through its clenched teeth, I don't think that I could be justly accused of exaggeration.
SINEAD O'CONNOR: Success Has Made A Failure Of Our Home
Every year an Irish festival is held in the park opposite our house.
In front of the stage, featuring dead serious folkie types in Arran sweaters and barnacle-encrusted fisherman's boots, mingles a paltry handful of die-hards.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the park, a huge crowd of all ages has a right old laugh in front of the stage on which stomp a Teddy Boy-outfitted showband blasting out Showaddywaddy's greatest hits liberally mixed with C&W classics.
Does this tell us something about Irish pop stars?
Probably not, but one can't help but speculate that the popularity of the showband in the Republic might go some way to explain the somewhat over-earnest search for ‘authenticity’ exhibited by U2.
Does Bono dream of electric sheep?
So Sinead O'Connor — probably our last remaining real rock star, a maverick, a 1000 per cent attack merchant constantly taking convention by the neck and shaking it the way a terrier shakes a rat, the woman who stormed into the Irish PM's office over the abortion issue, who refused to sing the US national anthem, who correctly pointed out that George Bush leaves Saddam Hussein standing in the mass-murder stakes, who has exposed her own sad past in vivid, gory detail, whose every record has fully stretched and excited the expectations of her audience — has released a version of Loretta Lynn's maudlin Country classic.
The strings and horns are both lush and delicate, gone completely are the swooping whoops and hollers — Sinead sings , gently,sweetly , taking the material totally on its own terms.
She follows this with a beautifully breathy version of Cole Porter's ‘You Do Something To Me’(from ‘Red, Hot & Blue’) and the Marilyn Monroe classic ‘I Want To Be Loved By You’(boo boo be doo!) and (next week, fan mugs!) you get the chance to buy the second half of this two CD set including the title track (again) plus ‘Someone To Watch Over Me’ and — wait for it —‘My Heart Belongs To Daddy’.
Alright, so the Monroe song is perhaps subverted by Sinead's sharp, orgasmic ‘Ow Ow’ at the end, but otherwise what we have here is straight-down-the-line, brilliantly performed grandparent-friendly pre-rock 'n' roll pop.
Why?
You dare to ask why?
You do not question the motives of a pop genius, little fanboy.
MINDLESS DISCO MUSIC FOR SCOUSER DRUG ADDICTS AND STINKING HIPPIES SINGLE OF THE WEEK
WHERE'S THE BEACH: Sex Slave Zombie
In the last episode of Star Trek —The Next Generation shown in this country, Captain Jean Luc Picard is kidnapped by the beastly automaton alien hive-race — the Borg.
Like the rest of the Borg, Jean Luc is stripped of all individual personality and forced to walk around with wires poking out from all his most intimate parts.
‘Aha!’ quipped my musician flatmate, ‘What an apt metaphor for techno!’
The sad fool.
‘Sex Stare Zombie’ is, quite simply, the best pop record of the week.
The fact that it is made by men with no faces and only two fingers each merely makes it all the more remarkable.
Doubtless the NME discopolice will now sneer and tell me this is a rubbish record and the version put out by Monty Palago & Wonka Vibe Jambo and remixed by AKU Faction Z in 1969 was much better — they always do.
But to hell with them, this is monstrous and beautiful.
If I was of a mind to stop washing and shaving and go live in a bus and drive around the country shitting in farmers' fields and killing their sheep and being hassled by the pigs and pilloried by the Daily Star and generally being ‘free’, this is the record I would choose to do it to.
The Beach-heads hear they've been cursed by a Swells SOTW
ABBA: Dancing Queen
BLUEBOY: Popkiss
BANANARAMA: Movin' On
THEE HEADCOATEES: My Boyfriend's Learning Karate
THE DARLING BUDS: Sure Thing
DIESEL PARK WEST: God Only Knows
SNUFF: Cubical
Let's take the Abs' third finest three minutes as our standard measure of a lovely pop record, a gloriously lush piece of silly bollocks to which all else must be compared.
Here are Blueboy (dreadful name, sniff suspiciously).
It says ‘Sarah 65’ on the sleeve, a sleeve which depicts two out of focus young men in nice jumpers and carefully ironed Levi 501's throwing stones on some pebbly south coast beach (lip curls).
Are they trying to brain a charging riot policeman or a pack of snarling, Union Jack-waving skinhead Morrissey fans?
It is doubtful.
Here it comes (tense up, growl).
Acoustic strumming, feeble, breathless posho whining about being sad (ATTACK!
ATTACK!
RENDER LIMB FROM LIMB!).
If you were in a wine bar with ferns, mellowed out on red wine and having a really sloppy kissy kissy lovey dovey ooghy woogy dinner with your lover and Blueboy came on as the cabaret, you would go berserk and slash open their gizzards with the cake fork.
The world's Number One Abba fan, Henry Rollins, has been informed of their home address.
NEXT!
Thee Headcoatees wear deer stalkers and plastic macs and play semi-acoustics on a distinctly hammy, Mersey-beaty cod-Japanese novelty record.
Just stupid and irritating enough to be a minor hit — but I doubt it.
Shuvorn has gorn off picking daisies in Katie Jane Garside doolally-land and the new one who used to pose in leather mags is no longer, but the two ‘Nanas that remain are fitter and leaner than ever.
This is not prime SAW, but at least it's good pop music.
Mad little Andrea of The Darling Buds is pictured on the sleeve of ‘Sure Thing’ with various things dangling from her prehensile lips.
This will not, however, suffice to disguise the fact that this format — bok-bok drums, half-hearted grungy guitars, submerged breathy vocals and a lilting semi-melody — is so lame and tired it should be taken down the vets for a lethal injection.
And there is an A&R man at EMI who is still utterly stunned that Diesel Park West aren't huger than The Rolling Stones.
This is the carbohydrate stodge  we were warned about in the Kylie article.
Snuff are what the Manics sneeringly refer to as ‘a T-shirt band’— meaning a group of young southern Englishmen forever willing to amble about in Transit van land and getting the occasional play on rubbish indie radio shows that nobody with any taste listens to.
On the strength of this piss-poor piddle of cockernee shouty dribble, they're absolutely right.
PSYCHO SEXUAL SEX TERRESTRIALS: Personal War
Great name.
Welsh.
Have written endless letters to Angst challenging the Manic Street Preachers to physical combat.
How could they be anything other than wonderful?
Sadly, they manage to combine all the worst qualities of the bedroom-band with none of the saving graces.
A total lack of musical skill combined with a total lack of imagination is a terrible thing to have to sit and listen to.
Pack it in, you lot should be music journalists.
NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS: I Had A Dream, Joe
What exactly is the appeal of this Cave cow?
His lyrics are abysmal tosh, his singing voice so stunted, adenoidal and gumby that it takes a real effort of will to remember that this isn't a joke, that this man is actually worshipped as a rock god by literally millions of depressed, terminally adolescent would-be heroin addicts worldwide.
He has got great bone structure and a really cool Addams Family wardrobe and he has written a novel, let's be fair.
But his music , come on, Emperor's New Clothes time or what?
The bloke's records are all rubbish and it's high time you all admitted it.
Or am I missing something?
Is he, perhaps, a greater poet and a great operatic tenor who merely sings pretentious bollocks in a voice that sounds as if he's drowning in his own snot as a sort of joke?
Hmmmm…
SEAWEED: Bill
AFGHAN WINGS: My World Is Empty Without You
TOM WAITS: Goin' Out West
‘Little brown sausages living in the sand!’
Grrrr!
In my dreams, Tom Waits, sick of life in the CD racks of the brain-dead baby boomer scum, moves to Seattle and picks up three thrash-lobotomised longhairies with whom to party.
The title track is so gruffly aggressive, tub-thumping mock-macho Jack-swigging radio-unfriendly urghygurghy rockadilly mad that it could be Tad in a good mood, dude.
At the end of the track the drummer throws down his sticks in disgust and stomps off — pretty punk rock or what?
After that, Waits retreats into his usual ho humdrum bummed-out bluesywoozy alkie drone mode mood muzak, the sort of mozzery gushy mush your dog would make if it had vocal chords and could handle its drink.
After predictably brash, bright and breezy powerpop run-throughs of ‘Bill’ and ‘Pumpkin’, Seaweed deliver a stupid, sexy and slyly squiggly head-screwing dubversh of ‘Squint’, which goes on far, far too long unless one is savagely drugged.
The Whigs mangle the ‘Paint It Black’ riff and insert it vigorously and repeatedly into the dry, dusty shell of a sad song about masturbation as a lifestyle priority rather than an optional extra.
Breaking down the walls of knobache is, of course,the most clichéd subject possible for a pop song but this is both swirly and burly and rarfer tasty .
SKID ROW: Youth Gone Wild
Blond pop sextoy Sebastian Bach once bowled me over with his combination of genital-stirring good looks and demented spiel.
Thus was I blinded to the fact that he is, in fact, the quintessential heavy metal arsehole.
Skid Row are ninth row division Guns N'Roses wannabes, and this turgid slab of rotting, flyblown rock ratmeat is about as sexy, young and wild as the corpse of David Mellor in a bulging G-string.
It is a tragedy of enormous proportions that their remains a vast audience for this achingly fake corporate ‘rebellion’.
POP WILL EAT ITSELF: Bullet Proof
The Poppies have, on occasion, made pop music so wonderful that the gods themselves have wept with delight.
They have also, it must be admitted, sometimes floundered and fumbled like ten-thumbed, hammer-footed, constipated, sexless oafs.
This is dumb stodge, an unsightly glob of yellowing lard studded with fag ends and bluebottle eggs, festering in the corner of some little frequented Midlands transport café.
SMASHING PUMPKINS: I Am One
An Angster recently asked why the music press devotes so much attention to US bands.
Because, sucker, taken en masse , they piss on their British peers.
This ‘Gish’ out-take is no earth-shattering pop classic, just a steely example of sweaty-fingered, control-freak intelligent-metal, and it still sounds eight to ten times superior to the Brit stuff that surrounds it in this week's pile of singles.
RANCID HELL SPAWN: Gastro Boy
ANTIHEROS: Election Day
SUPERCONDUCTOR: Heave With Puppy
EMPIRE FALLS: No Minute Warning
Every single time I do this job I find a new record by Rancid Hell Spawn on top of the pile.
Every time I rave about how sexy Rancid Hell Spawn's distorted, chaotic pop-stupidity is and every time you take not a blind bit of notice.
It is your loss.
Rancid Hell Spawn, you are the real Kings Of Rock and I salute you.
American slapheads Antiheros produce some fine leftish skinheady shouty music backed by a track entitled ‘Oi!’ in which we learn that Oi! is ‘the sound of the street for rebels’.
Actually Oi! was a mock-working class derivation of punk rock invented by a pig-faced scab which, thanks to the cowardice and stupidity of its main advocates, had rather a lot of Nazi scum amongst its rather dim cockernee fan base.
Morrissey, it should be pointed out, had absolutely nothing to do with it at the time.
Superconductor are wonderfully stupid and noisy, everybody playing a different tune and having a whale of a time whilst the singer gargles disinfectant.
Empire Falls embryonic agit-pop EP is musically uninspiring but lyrically superb.
Sample these few lines from ‘Destroy Protect And Survive’: ‘We train young men to drop fire from above/Yet their commanding officers won't let them write ‘ f— ’ on the side of their aircraft/Because it's obscene.’
THE GALLEY SLAVES: I've Come To Kill The President
BLAGGERS ITA: God Save The Cockroach
The Galley Slaves have the misfortune of hailing from Kew in Surrey.
The rather provocative title of their single having failed to garner them an interview with CNN , they have threatened to kill my family if the record isn't reviewed here.
Nice words, plaintive vocals, dreadful guitar playing.
The Blaggers ITA have put out a limited edition one-sided EP of which by far the best track is ‘It's Up To You’, which features the sampled words of Thomas Mensford (ex-singer with The Angelic Upstarts and alleged Morrissey mucker) in which Mensi accurately dissects the filth that is fascism.
It's a track that I'd love Morrissey to listen to, stupid wanker.
SINGLE (YOU WON'T BE HEARING ON THE RADIO) OF THE WEEK
MARXMAN: Sad Affair
One of the most disgusting traits exhibited by the liberal is his inability to smell shit when it's under his nose.
Thus Brit pop bands have righteously railed again and again against South African or Central American fascism and yet managed to ignore the mess on their own doorstep.
Agit-pop records about the north of Ireland are few and far between, most radical acts seemingly all too willing to swallow the ‘official’ British government line — that both sides are as bad as each other(they're mad, these Irish) and that if a few, crazed ‘terrorists’would just stop murdering people everything would be OK.
‘Sad Affair’ heroically attempts to put the record straight, putting the blame firmly where it belongs, on the real terrorists — on Britain.
Marxman join the ranks of the likes of Hiphoprisy and Consolidated, bands who are bangingly right-on to the hip-ho beat at a time (as we are constantly being reminded — YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN!) when to be anything other than either defeatist or mindless is utterly unfashionable.
Quite how Phonogram are going to market the band remains to be seen.
Suffice to say that the brilliant video (co-produced by ex- NME er Sean O'Hagan) has already been banned.

SHERMAN AT THE CONTROLS
Blinded by the lights and freaked out by the fractals?
Then let Vibes soothe your frazzled retinas in glorious monochrome!
So welcome WHYTE and barking mad THE BLACK DOG.
RAISING THE WOOF
When it comes to pure techno — the real deal interplanetary Detroit descendant, that is — Britain could easily come out with a resounding ‘nil points’ in any metaphysical Eurovision Song contest.
Or could it?
Sad-Core may have reduced our status to the sick man of Europe amidst the flourishing electronic dance scenes in Germany, Belgium and Holland, but some excavation reveals an underground whose shockwaves get bigger every day.
The Black Dog are at the forefront of a pack which often seems to have no desire to come out of the woodwork.
Irdial Records, B12-Musicology and the new Rephlex operation are already major forces but so far remain very much — to coin Underground Resistance's slogan —‘Music for those who know’.
There is a definite air of mystery around The Black Dog — helped along by the fact that their records have often been near-impossible to find.
But now signed to UK techno-pioneer Wayne Archbold's General Production Recordings, EPs like the transcendental ‘Virtual’ are at last starting to intoxicate an increasing number of central nervous systems with their glacial, jazz-tinged tone-explorations.
The Black Dog — Ken Downie, Ed Handley and Andy Turner — record all their sonic expeditions at the gothic-sounding Black Dog Towers, which turns out to be a terraced house in East London.
The three formed around 18 months ago and released a trio of EPs in a thousand pressings each.
Apart from the GPR records, The Dog appeared on the much acclaimed ART EP with Kirk DeGiorgio and — ultimate accolade!— released one on Detroit legend Carl Craig's Planet E Label (‘He just came round and had a chilli with us and we sorted it out’).
Of course, the slothful major labels are now starting to sniff around their hindquarters like the old German shepherd who just woke up.
‘We just couldn't find a lot of music we liked when we started so we just thought ‘let's try and make something we like,’’ says Ed.
The group are also computer buffs on a mission to not only push out musical frontiers but combine the whole thing into a total multi-media package.
The hard reality of limited fun is definitely holding them back, reckons Andy.
‘But it's got to be done because it's something we really believe in.
It's worth the pain,’ adds Ken.
The Black Dog make music for ‘chilling out to at home’.
They obviously despise hardcore but are not averse to mutating breakbeats.
‘It's another machine to be used,’ says Ed.
‘You want to reclaim it from the people that have been misused it.
That's what we've been doing.
There's going to be a lot more ambient-style tracks coming out soon.
There's going to be a changing period this year, the end of the hardcore thing to a more responsible techno with a bit more thought.
‘Just the whole mood at the party.
The breakbeats are so aggressive and stupid you feel like a dickhead trying to dance.
At least with some kind of trance it's subtle and there's a whole different atmosphere.
There isn't the aggressive stance.’

VIBES SINGLE OF THE WEEK
NEW ELEMENT: The Undertaker
YOU CAN usually spot a UK rap production a mile off — strapped for cash in an inadequate studio, British talent is too often stifled before it can start to grow.
But, along with the other twelves in this column, New Element's single spits from the speakers with the sort of beefy sound the UK has always dreamed of achieving.
Over a fat bassline and ruff scratching, TSD-1 drawls his lyric in a frighteningly laid-back manner reminiscent of Gang Starr's The Guru.
As befits a killer debut, it's a shit-kicking brag that warns competitors not to step to The Undertaker, or face the lyrical consequences.
Currently working on new tracks with ace mixer Cutmaster Swift, TSD-1 had better start stocking up on coffins for the sucker MCs — he's gonna need ‘em.
DADDY FREDDY: Haul And Pull
HE'S BACK!
The former holder of the world land speed rapping record ('til Curve's mate JC001 half-inched it) Freddy's spent the last couple of years in the US working on his next LP.
‘Haul And Pull’, the first single, is a fine piece of ragga in its LP version but becomes a rabid hip-hop monster in the Bobby Konders remix, complete with new words and a sneering woodwind sample.
Out September 7.
PARTY A LA MAIZON (PLZ): If It Ain't PLZ/Bad Person
PLZ ARE Londoner DJ Pogo and ex-pat US rappers Regi and Fredi, and is a debut for both them and the GFTJ label.
Pogo's production is expansive and clear, especially on the slower, more serious ‘Bad Person’, and the rappers have devised their own slang, too, so repeated listening is encouraged.
FGTJ are distributed by Rio, which means this 12″ should be available in your local Our Price but won't make it into the independent charts.
FORWARD INTENSE: Stated/Imply The Calm
H LYRICAL Son (the Spokesman) and DJ Arm hail from North London, managing to distribute their debut 12″ themselves after a year on the shelf in search of a label.
FI take their cure from Hijack's vocal stylings but don't succumb to the temptation to use lightning-fast beats at every available opportunity.
So ‘Stated’ has time to ooze menace from behind a barbed wire fence of a beat and the naggingly familiar sample that punctuates ‘Imply The Calm’is allowed to weave its hypnotic spell.
Intelligent and articulate, FI demand attention.
PD3: Noisy Music Pt II/Funky Rhymes Funky Style
THIS CURIOUS 12″ is predominantly the work of Pogo's sparring partner DJ Biznizz, and on ‘Funky Rhymes…’ the now label-less London Posse drop their only cut so far this year.
‘Noisy Music’ isn't the exercise in sirens and backfiring juggernauts the title suggests, but instead is an excellent slice of rare-groove instrumental dance music at a fast rap/slow house tempo.
If you have difficulties getting hold of the record, contact .
3:6 PHILLY: Those Flags Offend Me
KNOCKING AROUND for a while now.
‘Those Flags…’ is a wordy and articulate attack on patriotism and mindless devotion to abstract ideals.
Turning the British fascist's ‘there ain't no black in the union jack’ bullshit on its head, 3:6 Philly argue their case over a snappy jazz groove for the original, and rip up Run DMC's ‘Back From Hell’beats for the ‘Docta D version’.
another strong release.
CASH CREW: My In Sense Is Burning/The Provider
BETTER KNOWN to most readers of this paper as the label responsible for Headbutt, Mega City Four, Bizarre Inc and J Saul Kane's various aliases, Vinyl Solution are the UK's forgotten rap indie.
Following three ace Gunshot singles, the Portobello Road posse bring you two razor-sharp cuts from a Black British Muslim perspective.
‘Provider’ provides the hardcore noise over some old school samples.
HUE ROMANTICS
Who wants to be the disco king?
‘At the moment there is no icon, there are no pop stars because most people who are involved in dance music are doing it in their back room, we're out to change all that.’
Whyte motormouth mainman, Robert Gillama, is in full flow and waxing lyrical about world domination plans for his disco assassins.
In an arena where most bands are denied even their 15 minutes of fame, Whyte wants to live forever.
In an arena where music is married to a mixing desk, committed to computer and performed through basic PAs, Whyte still toil with bass and drums.
‘We're very much old school as far as playing's concerned,’ reckons Robert.
‘Technology is there to assist the musician, not take over and dominate.
Groups such as N-Joi and Altern 8 use dancers to give their performances a human feel, but what's the point?
Why don't they have a drummer up there and a bass player instead of programming everything?’
Whyte have paid their dues and done their YTS with countless disasters, eventually coming together three years ago with an inventive house interpretation of Jimi Hendrix's ‘Purple Haze’.
The track sank without a trace when their label went under, but undeterred Whyte are back with a new deal on Dieter Meier of Yello's Solid Pleasure Label.
Their first offering is ‘Promises’, a balearic bounder replete with flamenco-fuelled guitars and fey indie vocals.
Hispanic house with a sunshine vibe and a Fabi Paras facelift to boot.
And Whyte can't wait to get out there and show the masses just who is behind the latest mover.
To hell with anonymity and mystery.
Whyte wanna be adored.
‘I'll tell you something,’ gabbles Robert enthusiastically, ‘There's no-one out there now whose doorstep I'd be willing to kip on just to get their autograph.
Ten years ago there was Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, OK they looked daft and camped it up, but people wanted to talk to them, wanted to see them.
There was something both tacky and glamorous about them.
Nowadays what have you got?
Who the hell wants to go and see that Trumpton lot or The Prodigy, when you can see them out in clubs off their nut — it takes all the mystery out of pop culture.’
Who wants to be the disco kings?
Whyte do of course.
Looking for a cosy doorstep to crash in: Whyte
FILM
EDITED BY GAVIN MARTIN
THE FULL DELMONTE
Juice is the directorial debut of ERNEST DICKERSON, Spike Lee's cinematographer and a man with a long-standing desire to portray black urban street life just as it is, as IAN McCANN discovers
OUCH!
I retrieve my right hand, or what's left of it, from Ernest R Dickerson's mighty grip.
I pride myself on being the hardest man on the planet but Dickerson has just reduced my bones to powder.
Is it enthusiasm, a warning, or just uncontrollable strength?
Whatever, it puts you on your guard.
With your left hand.
Ernest Dickerson is a big, stocky man with a soft, warm voice.
If he has been known at all to movie-goers thus far, it's been as Spike Lee's cinematographer: even when Lee's brashness caused you to squirm in your seat, you still have something pretty marvellous to look at, and that's Ernest Dickerson's work.
Now he's stepped into the director's shoes himself for Juice , yet another shock story from young black America.
You know the drill: ghetto kids, gangs, rap music, crime, with the title drawn from street-slang for authority and male outlaw power.
The irony is,Juice could have been the first from the starting blocks, as he explains from an unstreet sofa in a chintz sitting room in Soho's exclusive Hazlitt's Hotel.
‘My co-writer Gerard Brown and I actually got the idea for Juice about ten years ago.
It came out of what we saw going on, the increasing pressure on kids today compared with how it was when we were growing up.
We were seeing how it was becoming more dangerous, violent, with the growing presence of guns amongst kids.
I mean, when we were growing up, you didn't settle anything with a gun, you did it with your fists.’
Dickerson and Brown began interviewing kids to find out how they felt about life, pressure and violence, and took the resulting screenplay, ‘an adult story for kids’, he explains, to several studios and a host of big-name producers.
No-one wanted to know, unless they could get rewrites where everyone lived happily ever after and stars of The Cosby Show had the lead roles.
‘That's why I cast so many unknowns when I came to make the movie,’ Dickerson reasons.
‘They had to be believable as the kind of kids you'd see on the streets, but not on TV.
It had to be raw, and anyone well-known would bring luggage to the film.’
It's not hard to understand the moneymen's indifference to Dickerson's proposal.
This was, after all, a time when black youth movies were Beat Street or Krush Groove , ie about as street as West Side Story .
Then came Spike Lee, who shoved through the door left ajar by the commercial success of Eddie Murphy, and suddenly Dickerson was too busy to push Juice ahead of cinematography projects like She's Gotta Have It ,School Daze and Do The Right Thing .
Surely he felt a modicum of frustration watching the black youth movie take shape until it looked like Juice was an afterthought to Boyz N The Hood .
Has he been stung by comparisons between Juice and New Jack City/Boyz ?
‘New Jack City came out about a week before we started shooting, and I didn't even know what it would look like.
I don't think there's a comparison between them.
Boyz N The Hood has more of a connection because it is dealing with kids of the same age group, although Juice deals with an entirely different set of issues.’
There are easy comparisons: both have kids growing up in the same neighbourhood.
Both movies look at the pressures on young black urban males.
Both have rappers in lead roles:Juice is like a rap toll-call, with a major part for Tupac Shakur of Digital Underground, and EPMD, Latifah, and members of En Vogue and Naughty By Nature in small parts.
Another thing they have in common, sadly, is violence at screenings; one kid was shot dead outside the cinema on Juice 's opening night and it caused distributors Paramount to withdraw advertising for the movie.
Hence Juice was probably not as big a box-office success as it might have been, although it did make money.
‘The press made a lot of people afraid of the movie,’ says Dickerson, ‘and Paramount might have tried to counteract that.’
He views the violence as ‘a Friday night thing’, ie the sort of random trouble that happens all over America.
It does sadden him, but he believes that Juice will maybe explain a few of the pressures kids are under.
He cites a Brooklyn playground shooting as an example.
Two lads were the best of friends, grew up together, and yet one shot the other.
In a discussion group at the school concerned, a teacher asked the kids why this should have happened between two friends.
Go see Juice , said the kids.
Then you'll know.
Since finishing Juice , Dickerson has again worked on a Spike Lee movie, this time the Malcolm X biopic.
An epic three hours in the director's cut, Dickerson says he's ‘very proud of the movie.
I've wanted to make that film since college’.
Dickerson and Lee seem to have been saving Malcolm X up for years; they were buddies at film school.
While Lee's claims on Dickerson are evidently still large, perhaps he'd better look for a new cinematographer now that his old pal has a director's credit.
However, when Dickerson says shooting Malcolm X was ‘like a holiday’, it becomes clear that there's maybe a good reason for keeping his hand in when it comes to his old discipline.
That hand is  proffered for a farewell handshake, and this time I ask him not to squeeze so hard.
Some guys have got too much juice…
JUICE
FOUR HARLEM kids get out of bed: the fat one; the hard one; the cute one; the aspiring hip-hop DJ.
School beckons but they don't go, preferring instead to hustle girls, steal records and have run-ins with the local Puerto Rican gang.
There are pressures to Be Someone, and Q, the DJ (Epps), sees his break at a mixing contest overseen by a decidedly sassy Queen Latifah.
But not everyone in the gang has Q's options and inclinations, and the hard one, Bishop (Shakur), decides that the best way he and the guys can prove they've got ‘the juice’ is by robbing the corner store.
Deliberately confrontational, Bishop sets up the heist on the same night as the DJ contest.
What's more, Bishop isn't in it just for the money, he wants to see some blood spilt — even that of his friends…
Juice is yet another black youth thriller from America.
Credible in that the peaceable Q is clearly the character you're supposed to identify with, it becomes, ultimately, very simple.
Can Q get to Bishop before Bishop kills everyone?
As a thriller it's reasonably effective, but not as gripping as New Jack City simply because it deals with a more believable situation.
All the same, what tips Bishop over the top?
One minute he's an ordinary guy, the next an articled headcase out to kill everyone.
Paranoia?
The Government?
Machismo fantasies?
We never really find out.
However, the casting excellent, the rap cameos an amusingly mild distraction, and the photography conveys the atmosphere of the locale effectively.
It's a shame that it's now become part of a genre rather than the opening salvo it might have been, since Juice now has an air of predictability about it.
Three years ago there was hardly a young black cinema at all, now critics are drawing comparisons as if bored with the idea.
However, now we're spoilt for choice, it has become clear  that Juice is neither the best nor the worst of the genre: less sentimental and powerful  than Boyz N The Hood , and far superior to Straight Outta Brooklyn ,Juice is still a fair way to spend an hour or two.
In deadly Ernest: Juice director Dickerson
Young guns: Bishop and Q fight for the right to party
NEW DIRECTORS
EVERY YEAR the British Film Institute issues a package of British short films by up-and-coming movie-makers, giving you a chance to read for the first time the credits you'll be seeing on Channel 4 in the next couple of years.
As usual, this batch has its ups and downs.
Notably free of movies on white heterosexual themes, the programme includes Danny Thompson's Public Enemy/Private Friends , a good-natured if thin Brixton-set comedy about three ranting rap-type youths desperately trying to find their lost ticket to a Public Enemy concert; Cheryl Farthing's Rosebud , an effective but slightly posey awakening-of-lesbian-desires item with an appealing cast and silly fantasy touches, and Mark Nash's Between Two Worlds , about a gay florist in psychoanalysis.
Gillian Lacy and Roberto Mader's Capoeira Quickstep is the most ambitious and also most disappointing of the collection, a ‘fictional documentary’ about the Afro — Brazilian dance-cum-martial art which sort of spins off from a relationship between a British girl and a Brazilian but meanders somewhat in sub-Terence Davies style without even coming up with much in the way of dance.
Ludmila Andrews' Mad ,Bad Mortal Beings is about the emotional turmoil of a black woman recovering from a relationship, and Sonali Fernando's Shakti is a brief fable about a trash-collecting Asian woman who sees off a white yob with sort-of magic powers and struts around in funky transformed shoes.
None of the films are too long to outstay their welcome, but there aren't any real home runs in the batch, which range from the slickly professional (Rosebud ) to the endearingly rough-and-ready (Public Enemy/Private Friends ).
Probably recommendable chiefly to Britflick completists and producers shopping around for cheap talent.
THE CUTTING EDGE
ICE DANCE queen Moira Kelly would be spinning her way to gold on the padding of daddy's millions if only she could find that elusive partner good enough.
Enter ex-hockey star D B Sweeney, rough-edged, cynical, not one to take anything sliding across the rink on his backside.
And not exactly the picture of tolerance.
Sparks fly as quick as the pirouettes.
Straining, successfully, to eradicate any trace of intelligence, Glaser pulls out every stop to rack up his movie to cloying extremes.
Yet despite predictability beyond the nth degree and an overload of musical montages,The Cutting Edge is insanely entertaining.
Why?
Could it be the dazzling obviousness that these two petulant skaters are, below all that ice, besotted with other, because don't opposites always attract?
Could it be the hysterical over-the-top camerawork, proving any amount of slow-motion and soft-focus still do not actually score as style.
Or perhaps it could be the heart-stopping finale where they finally, sorry, break the ice, and after a quick peckeroo execute the near impossible Pamchenko manoeuvre (basically he grabs her by the feet and spins her in increasing circles, and she prays he doesn't let go).
Who knows?
But we do know love will out, and despite a script with the credibility of a Jewish pigfarm, everyone's going to have a brainless Friday-evening time of it getting there.
Crap for the whole family to enjoy.
NIGHT AND DAY (NUIT ET JOUR)
BLISSFULLY HAPPY young couple Jack and Julie share a Paris love nest wallowing in minimalist luxury on his earnings from nocturnal cab driving.
Daytime shifts on the same taxi are handled by lonely Joseph, who meets Julie one evening and — this being a French movie — takes her to bed.
Cue oodles of tastefully-lit shag scenes and much sour meditation on the nature of love.
Elegant economy would seem to be writer/director Akerman's forté, framing her fragile menage a trois in the barest surroundings before letting it quietly disintegrate.
Yet given the steamy circumstances, this whole shebang seems oddly passionless.
Inane adolescent power games are numbly played out, with all the usual navel-gazing and self-justification supplanting any insight or honesty between our irritating trio of protagonists.
Minor niggles like how these apparently penniless youngsters can afford hotel rooms every night , or their blatant film-set apartment, are never explained.
Akerman's throwaway pseudo-feminist conclusion strains for a progression missing from the drama — Julie attaining adulthood — although it might be an interesting bid to reverse the casual sexism of Truffaut's Jules Et Jim , similar in theme, 30 years ago.
Even so, in all senses, a very ordinary affair.
TV—RADIO
PAUL THE OTHER ONE
He may not be a rock 'n' roll comedian, but TV's Mr Sardonic PAUL MERTON is more than just an ubiquitous face, and ANDREW COLLINS salutes him
NICE TO see him, to see him, nice.
Paul Merton has the first post-modern catchphrase.
‘Innit marvellous!’
He's said it about three times, on last year's Channel 4 series Paul Merton The Series , and he grafted it, unnaturally, onto his screen persona very much as an anti-catchphrase, as a joke joke .
It's crap.
It's far from alternative.
It's shallow.
But it is forced and that's the point.
Hope you're all playing this one at home.
Here's a good one.
The people who commission comedy for TV and radio need lining up and shooting.
BOOM!
BOOM!
So clueless and misguided are these sorry types — so lacking in insight, intent and, bloody hell, a sense of humour — that if a great comedy show ever makes it to TV List magazine it can only be DESPITE the pony-tails whose job it is to shepherd these things to a laff-hungry public.
Laugh?
I nearly laughed.
Paul Merton slipped through the net.
Fat, funny, and unfashionably 36, he is the seasoned London cabaret circuit stand-up it's OK to like.
A full 12 years after ditching his civil service day job, TV's Mr Sardonic is a ubiquitous face — having served his time on springboard improv workshop Whose Line Is It Anyway ? as The Other One (or John Sessions' bit of rough) and co-written Julian Clary's Sticky Moments , Merton soon reached the dizzy but inevitable heights of his own Channel 4 series.
Post-modern title, recycled stand-up material cleverly ‘disguised’ as the bit in the tobacconist's kiosk, and the usual wacky sketch format lent a healthy continuity by the fact that Merton eschewed the 15-scriptwriters fall-back and wrote the entire series with long-time collaborator John Irwin.
Although we conduct our interview in an air-conditioned hole at Paul Merton's spiritual home, Channel 4, drinking tea from unwieldy tureens, it is the ever-dependable Beeb who have thus far harnessed his slippery talents most deftly.
Cult-turned-flagship Have I Got News For You garnered six million viewers this year, a BBC2 chart-topper, and, as Merton observes, ‘You don't hear a bad thing said about it!’
Played against the fist-faced public school bile of Ian Hislop and genius swagger of Angus Deayton, Merton's deadpan asides, regular flights of insanity and crap T-shirts have earned him a place in our hearts forever.
That it is by far the funniest and most essential comedy show on television (fourth series imminent in October, kids!) is a sad indictment, I mean, all that money Roy Clarke earns…
‘EEEEEEAAARRH’ SAYS Paul.
This is the affirmative in the style of a laconic drawl.
In daft Magic Roundabout T-shirt and with enough of that stubborn hair to necessitate a hand pushed through it every two seconds, Paul Merton is far from the detached misery he portrays on the box.
Since much of Have I Got News For You 's allure lies in its overnight topicality, we ponder the speed and efficiency of ‘sick’ jokes in the school playground.
From Lesley Wittle to Zeebrugge, it has always been a matter of hours before the first risqué punchline filters in.
‘Somebody once told me that the network was long-distance lorry drivers…’ ponders Paul.
‘The joke evolves down the pub in Newcastle, and the lorry driver tells it at a truck-stop and within 24 hours it's all over the country.’
In sixth form days, he and John Irwin actually invented a joke in a free period (‘I can't remember how it went now, something involving a foreskin, no doubt’).
Eight years later, Paul was sitting in a bloke's house in Wrexham who told him the very same joke!
Merton's written an entirely new set for the Edinburgh Festival, but the last time he did any substantial stand-up was in Australia in '89.
In the interim, has TV taught him anything about comedy?
‘Not really.
Doing television only teaches you about doing television really.
There are traps you can fall into if you do too much television — although I've been on a lot since '89, I do tend to turn most things down.
The people who are taking over from TVS — Meridian Television — are bringing The Dating Game from the States (a sort of pointless adult Blind Date), and they wanted me to host it.
But they wanted to do 65 programmes!
Hur hur!
A) I wouldn't do it anyway, even if they were doing four, and B) it would be difficult to keep up the quality over 65 programmes!
You'd think ‘Oh, the 38th one wasn't quite as good as the 19th…’
Although he's co-presenting BBC's TV Hell (a dazzlingly obvious three-and-a-half hour antidote to Channel 4's TV Heaven whereby kitsch rubbish is dredged from the archives), Paul Merton does not watch much television.
His video's broken — but it doesn't unduly worry him.
‘If I saw a comedy show that was very good, I'd get depressed, and if I saw something that was very bad, I'd get depressed.
I don't see myself in competition with other comedians, although I am .’
Oh yes, there'll be young bucks out there who see you as old and in the way.
You may be NEW on telly, but anyone who's followed ‘the circuit’ in London will see your name very much as an old slipper.
‘Eeeeeeaaahh.
Maybe I should go out and abuse some kids, get rid of that ‘safe’ tag.’
You're not a rock 'n' roll comedian are you?
‘What's a rock 'n' roll comedian?’
Well, Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, Gerry Sadowitz, Rob Newman and Dave Baddiel…
Teenage girls actually scream at Newman.
‘Screaming at comedy gigs, that's a new one,’ he mutters, disapprovingly, ‘It all sounds a bit like Gary Glitter to me.’
DESPITE THE sneer in his Jonathan Ross-like Cockney voice, Merton is clearly a warm and generous human being — not actually above all this, just sort of beyond it.
To one side.
When he first started out, he used to wear a pair of very baggy, red striped pyjamas!
They lasted six months.
‘I had them on one night at the South Bank Poly and I just thought to myself, ‘I can't be bothered with this, I really can't’.
If I'd become known as the Man In The Pyjamas, I'd have to wear those pyjamas for the rest of my life!
If I went out at the age of 68 at Drury Lane to celebrate Rory Bremner's 50 years in showbusiness and I hadn't got my pyjamas on, somebody would shout ‘Where's your pyjamas’?’
Paul Merton, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
Didn't he do well?
Paul Merton presents TV Hell on Bank Holiday Monday at 7.30pm.
A repeat of Paul Merton The Series and a new series of Julian Clary's Sticky Moments begins on Channel 4 on September 11.
‘Would you like a cup of tea, dear?’

FISHBONE: The Reality Of My Surroundings
MISLEADINGLY TAKING its title from their latest long-player,The Reality Of My Surroundings is a dazzling history of Fishbone's seven-year career.
To its credit, it bypasses biographical thoroughness in favour of a succession of interviews, monologues, home movie clips and promo videos that chart the progress of their eclectic agit-pop in a beautifully quirky fashion.
Guitarist Kendall Jones plays the straight man, articulating Fishbone's mix-and-match musical philosophy in earnest, common-sense terms while his colleagues lark about with frantic abandon — particularly livewire vocalist Angelo Moore.
Punctuating the chat is a chronological sequence of the band's vids, which neatly illustrate Fishbone's steady move from scratchy skaa-funk to more MTV-friendly fare.
The early efforts are low-budget romps, akin to the kind of shambling college-project material that's usually the preserve of British indie outfits, but things become slicker as the band mature, as evidenced by ‘Sunless Saturday’— a cinematic masterstroke that finds Spike Lee adding claustrophobic visuals to a song that embodies the oppressive squalor of Fishbone's native Los Angeles.
It's a fast-paced, illuminating and frequently hilarious show, but the portrait is left incomplete by the short shrift given to film of Fishbone onstage — surely the one place where their controlled chaos makes perfect sense — and a surprising lack of emphasis on the political apoplexy that makes them so fascinating.
Fishbone's Angelo Moore: get ‘Real’ -ity
There are 20 spanking new copies of this definitive Fishbone compilation going to the winners of this week's competition.
And how much more easy could it be.
Just write the name of Fishbone's singer on a postcard and send it to:

Cheers' NORM joins Madness…
Malcolm X — SPIKE LEE's time-bomb ready to blow…
MADONNA's multi-media money-spinning deal
GEORGE WENDT, better known as Norm, barfly supreme in Cheers , joined together with the reformed MADNESS for the pilot of new music programme Spunk recently.
Wendt, a noted hardcore fan way back in the days when Nirvana were still a mod band, has been presenting the acts on Saturday Night Live for some years.
But Spunk , produced by Initial in conjunction with Go!
Discs, may never actually see the light of day.
It's just one of six programmes commissioned by Channel 4 to fill a slot for ‘an original new music programme’.
Censor-taunting MADONNA has got into bed with the censor besieged Time-Warner.
Madonna's long awaited multi media entertainment company Maverick, embracing film, books, TV and music publishing, signed a $60 million deal with Warner under a seven year arrangement which, should everyone be happy, can be extended to 11 years.
Projects under consideration include James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room and a movie biography of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.
But on the latter, Madonna has been beaten to the punch.
ANNABEL SCIORRA will play the Mexican activist artist Frida Kahlo in The Brush Of Anguish , set in the turbulent 1930s and directed by Latino Luis Valdez.
Time-Warner are already facing pre-release criticism of SPIKE LEE's Malcolm X and observers reckon the DENZIL WASHINGTON-starring movie may prove to be as incendiary an issue as Bodycount's ‘Cop Killer’.
Lee's proposed opening for the movie, based on a script written by James Baldwin, is an American flag being licked with flames behind a credit sequence until it forms the title X .
This is followed by recent contemporary footage such as the Rodney King beating.
Rumours abound that Warners will try to persuade Lee, pressured to change the original opening of Jungle Fever , to alter the introduction.
Already exhibitors are demanding that Warner Brothers supply extra security for when the three-hour 22-minute, $33 million epic hits US screens in November.
Also making a mark with the censors is The Naked Lunch .
The David Cronenberg adaptation of William S Burroughs' novel was seized after opening on four screens in the Greek capital of Athens.
Authorities claimed it was ‘inciting young people to engage in homosexuality and the use of narcotics’.
Fans of the Rome episode in Jim Jarmusch's Tom Waits-soundtracked Night On Earth will be pleased to know that cab driver ROBERTO BENIGNI, for years a boffo box office certainty in his homeland, will soon be making a revival of Blake Edwards' Pink Panther series.
Edwards has signed Benigni to play the illegitimate offspring of Inspector Clouseau in the forthcoming Son Of Pink Panther .
IMAX, the large screen format used by THE ROLLING STONES for their At the Max live concert film will open a 500 seater venue on London's South Bank in two years' time.

TO SOME, Rollins is a cartoon character, Captain Testosterone — the abused child who has over-compensated his way to semi-stardom.
To his peers among the hardcore diaspora he is punk rock personified, the noble savage — poet, performer and publisher, a Nietzschian superman in baggy black shorts and ‘Search And Destroy’ tattoos.
But is even the most ardent Rollins wannabe capable of consuming six spoken word CDs?
This curious art-form relies heavily on the performer's strength of personality and Rollins, like fellow spoken-worder Biafra, bulges with chutzpah, charisma and balls.
Rollins' forte is the anecdote and the near-hysterical rant and, when he veers too far into the territory of the poet, the philosopher or the stand-up comedian, the results can be a wee bit naff.
But Rollins tells a mean story and, godammit, the man can be funny .
His penchant for punching people out, his notoriously foul temper, his painful honesty and his excruciatingly rigorous self-criticism combine to make riveting listening.
The tale that tickled me most concerns a trip to England — a country which Rollins caricatures as a pissing-with-rain hell hole populated entirely by spotty Morrissey-worshipping wimps who eat nothing but fish and potatoes smeared with grease.
Rollins, the ultimate ugly American, is late for a plane, all the tube trains have stopped running and the only way he can get the London Underground employees to pay him any attention is to scream ‘THE SMITHS HAVE REFORMED!’
Like many of his anecdotes, the pay-off line is self-deprecating and almost profound and here, I think, lies the secret of Rollins' popularity.
He is a scared and frightened child in the body of a beetle-browed body-builder — a cross between the Incredible Hulk and the hero of Home Alone — at once both intimidating and endearingly vulnerable.
He is able to be painfully honest (and funny) about a childhood encounter with a baby raper and the misogyny that resulted from his disastrous teenage sex life — I mean, this guy would be a superb candidate for Radio 4's In The Psychiatrist's Chair .
He makes cutting observations about racism and sexism and then, unfortunately, veers into lame sneer-along homophobia.
I don't think I've ever experienced a recording which has so intensely provoked so many of my emotions.
Deep Throat is a package not unlike Rollins himself.
As large as life and death, both funny and sad — and not a little dangerous.
CRAWLSPACE
Sphereality
TRASH CAN SCHOOL
Sick Jokes And Wet Dreams
LONG GONE John, the self-styled ‘Anti-Mogul/President/Swell Guy’ behind Long Beach independent Sympathy For the Record Industry, once used to toss his cookie into the lap of any damn intellectual foolish enough to sling the term ‘free jazz’his way.
But perhaps the old goat's loosening up a bit, if Crawlspace's latest slice of free spirit improvisation is any indicator of where LGJ's personal musical taste is heading these days.
‘Sphereality’ was recorded live in concert and finds Crawlspace hanging on to the shreds of their psychedelic shape-shifting strum (last featured on the 45 they made with Mooseheart Faith), only this time they are even more adventurous and what unravels goes far beyond any trip/trance acid groove.
Their rock roots are showing, naturally, but there is also a strong element of free-form experimentation present in their performance.
A grinding of creative gears that mushes the marrow from the bones of such legendary leviathans as 13th Floor Elevators, Amon Duul II, Crawlspace have provided Sympathy with its most adventurous release so far.
Trash Can School's name suggests that here is a most predictable Sympathy band with lotsa grease 'n' grunge 'n' rock'n'roll.
Well…
Although Trash Can School certainly provide several excellent examples of the genre (‘President Junkie’ and ‘I Want Out’being particularly notable) that's not all they deliver.
Trash Can School have, like Crawlspace, an urge to experiment and tinker with new toys.
So while they are happy to hammer out their version of Blue Oyster Cult's ‘Godzilla’, they are also keen to let rip with ‘Incinerator’, which boils with improvised noise and twisted, tortured threat.
Trash Can School are an astonishing accomplishment.
‘Sick Jokes And Wet Dreams’ belongs next to the Babes' ‘Fontanelle’and Sonic Youth's ‘Dirty’in the best rock record of '92 stakes.
MONKS OF DOOM
The Insect God
THE DEMISE of much-missed American loonies Camper Van Beethoven produced, in amoeba-like fashion, two outfits continuing their tradition of semi-psychedelic weird-pop.
Frontman David Lowery went on to develop Camper's spiky, satirical side with Cracker, while his colleagues formed the Monks Of Doom, a prolific bunch who've pursued a less-than-earth-shaking career on a series of garden-shed US indie labels.
‘The Insect God’ is a five-track affair that finds the Monks placing predictable emphasis on their fascination with the stranger side of the 1960s: Syd Barrett's ‘Let's Split’gets a splenetic shot in the arm, there's a hefty dose of home grown acidic madness in the shape of an eight-minute ‘mini rock-opera’, and proceedings clatter to a close with the chaotic run through The Mothers Of Intervention's ‘Who Are The Brain Police?’.
It's all good fun, for sure, but without Lowery's unique wit, the Monks sound like a kooky bar band: entertaining, in an inconsequential, drinking-soundtrack kind of way, but hardly worth a second listen.
COPPER KILLER
SUGAR
Copper Blue
THE PLAIN facts first: this is the return to centre stage that everyone hoped Bob Mould would make.
After the bleak, tortured inconsistency of his last LP, ‘Black Sheets Of Rain’— which marked the end of his solo deal with Virgin America and brought the final curtain down on his immediate life, post-Hüsker-Dü —‘Copper Blue’ is, without doubt, the dawning of a new era.
This is why it's hardly worth going into the ins-and-outs of his previous (albeit ground-breaking and influential) outfit here.
The days of the Hüskers are gone.
Both Mould and Grant Hart have put the whole drama behind them.
all that needs saying is that Mould is back in a big way…
With a razor-sharp cleaver, a new band, a revitalised, retuned outlook on the unevenness of life.
This is Mould, for the first time since his epic ‘Workbook’ album, recapturing his sense of The Definitive: the last word in love songs and the full stop after heartbreak.
What's more, ‘Copper Blue’ hammers home the realisation that Bob Mould could be around for years to come.
Whereas before his longevity — in keeping with his apparent state of mind — was always uncertain and open to question, these days his songs suggest a comparatively stable figure.
(I can imagine people in the future treating Mould like Dylan or Springsteen, except without the references to highways, God or encroaching senility.)
Obviously, his past-history is back in fashion, after the success of Nirvana and the consequent re-investigation of the last ten years of American punk rock.
There's an appetite for Mould, which helped sell out his two recent London shows with ease.
But rather than simply treading water, the big man has put his stock in the new material — which is more relevant than nostalgic.
Also, this album's on Creation which — at least until last week — conjured up an aura of freedom around him.
In essence Bob Mould has made a fresh start, even if it's a wary one.
You wonder at times if anything is straightforward in Bob's world: does he find popping down the shops for a loaf of bread an emotionally distressing experience?
Can he pick up a tin of beans without feeling that it hates him?
‘Copper Blue’ is a great jumble of questions and realisations.
The now well-honed Mould character traits are everywhere: his underlying cynicism, the ongoing mistrust of people and the bits where his head sounds like it's about to explode.
But this time round, Mould is also back on the offensive, following his past, demoralised-sounding work.
Virtually every track is a winner, though it's the optimistic ones which shine through initially, like the recent (prophetic) single ‘Changes’ with its sinewy lead guitar line, and Side Two's poppy ‘If I Can't Change Your Mind’.
The latter has a lyric set round an argument which Bob not so much gives in to, but agrees to differ on…
THE SHOCK OF IT ALL!
Bob Mould in a near-forgiving state of mind!
How different is that to his previous passionate vendettas?
Elsewhere, ‘Copper Blue’ is ferocious.
Sugar have provided the right vehicle for Mould to tether his current world-view to, providing (with Mould's guitar and the tightness of the rhythm section) a set of beautifully hard-knuckled rock arrangements that give him the clout he needs to reinforce the feeling inherent in his vocals.
Following the intense intro of ‘The Act We Act’, the sceptical ‘A Good Idea’ lunges in with a gripping bassline and a teasing stab of guitar.
You can imagine Mould in a video for it, taking a flame-thrower to the Garden Of Eden and sitting triumphantly amidst the ashes.
There are still glimpses of Mould's feeling of uselessness — if not with himself, then with his relationship with other people, borne out by the aforementioned ‘If I Can't Change Your Mind’ and the earlier ‘Helpless’.
He sounds like he's still going through a learning process, coming to terms with the fear of losing friends, and at the same time is worried that he's being misunderstood himself.
Check his scorched-earth vocals for the sound of self-doubt.
The overall atmosphere is one of unrelenting power, mixed with a critical commentary.
Side Two's opener, ‘The Slim’, typifies Sugar's ability to slow things down, with a grinding, winding melody that backs Mould as he tumbles through a drawn-out flashback nightmare, which makes temporary amnesia seem like a healthy option.
Mould, though, goes out with a sly nod towards the future.
You can even hear him laugh, before the start of the finale ‘Man On The Moon’, a grunge-like lullaby that acts as a reassuringly warm, parting gesture.
For a man who sounds like he's been to hell and back and been burned along the way, Mould has returned to heal old wounds.
With Sugar and ‘Copper Blue’ he's made a great start.
POPINJAYS
Flying Down to Mono
LIKE CARTER, the Popinjays are one of those UK indie turns that have got a liberating blast from the arrival of cheapo, user-friendly technology, turning their intensive sweet-shop dramas into enormo stomping noise-storms.
Where there was a danger in the past of them getting tagged as the Talulah Gosh it's OK to laugh with, the Popinjays have packed away their school recorders and become grander, more articulate and sexy than you'd have ever guessed before.
When I hear songs like ‘Sun’ and ‘Snowblind’I get to thinking of Blondie's ‘Union City Blue’— the sonic glory and writing confidence, the way a cool verse flips into a tasty bridge and then choruswards, the way that sad words are dropped into an uplifting tune, leaving you moved and confused.
The cheery desperation in there.
Fair play to Ian Broudie for putting his trademark sparkle on the music and for letting the loony parts lie, the way that ‘Monster Mouth’ is Jim Bob after getting his throat sorted by Tona De Brett, and how the chorus of ‘Too Jung’is a saucy steal from The Smiths' ‘London’.
Meanwhile, in coversville you have The Mamas And The Papas' ‘Getting Better’ complete with frazzled Brit signature — now it sounds like it was written with The Bull And Gate in mind!
Down in Mono Valley, you can be sure there are abused kids, sad sweet dreamers, the misunderstood and the distracted — all huddled under its hazy horizons, but the Popinjays have their own style of empathy and a philosophical get-out line that says ‘nothing ever goes away, it just becomes before and you'll find it all once more.’
Which is sort of comforting.
I think.
IF THE CAPPUCCINO FITS…
PAUL WELLER
Paul Weller
HAVING BECOME the Julian Copes of jazz café soul, The Style Council parted company because their records had become so deranged that no-one could comprehend even the tiniest part of them.
Then Paul Weller formed a group with the extraordinarily hopeless name of The Paul Weller Movement (for someone so fascinated by Englishness, you'd think he'd have noticed the national Jokes About Bowels obsession), started performing Jam songs and left Polydor.
Now Weller is on Go!
Discs (aka Fred Perry Records) and, having dispensed with group names (never his strongest point) he has released his debut album, ‘Paul Weller’.
One's first hearing of this album is not a happy event.
Those expecting a veering away from the aforesaid jazz café soul direction will be disappointed; Weller plays more guitar than before, but it is a sparkly, jazzbo sort of guitar and not feedback mod or anything like that.
His voice is still soft and R & B crooning, he still works with Steve White and DC Lee and Mick Talbot gets a writing credit.
Galliano are mentioned.
Neither are subsequent hearings of this album likely to cause the listener to shout ‘Christ almighty!
This is the best record ever made!’— the songs lack the bursting invention and variation of great pop/soul/jazz/harmonica gumbo or whatever to lift them into that category.
But the cynical should be advised; this is the best thing Weller has done since he binned those awful black-and-white golf shoes and invented frothy coffee.
Sure, the references are obvious.
‘Clues’ is Van Morrisonesque, ‘The Strange Museum’owes a bit to ‘Ain't No Sunshine’, ‘Uh Huh Oh Yes’is very like ‘Are ‘Friends’Electric?’by Soul Brother Number One Gary Numan.
Some of the tunes are noodling, familiar and limp rather than languid.
Lyrics like ‘Who am I?
What am I?
Where am I to go?’ and song-titles like ‘Kosmos’and ‘Into Tomorrow’are meaningless to all but the author.
Everything else, whoever, is fine.
‘Bullrush’ and ‘Remember How We Started’are swirling, finely balanced mixtures of the delicate and the insistent (and ‘Bullrush’has this great stupid bit nicked off ‘I Am The Walrus’).
Most things are played with conviction, most things have neat tunes and, although nothing ever leaps out and changes your life ‘Paul Weller’ is a decent record for a bastard hot sticky day.
Bring on the Pimm's and let's have a sing-song around the old Hammond because Paul Weller is back.
Nearly, anyway.
His Perryness Saint Paul of Woking
EUGENIUS
Oomalama
GIVEN THEIR previous, borrowed moniker, it's hardly surprising that Captain America's chosen brand of guitar fury bows to bands both ancient and new.
If you're looking for ground-breaking mayhem, you got off at the wrong Greyhound stop.
It's ironic that fuzzified guitars have — somehow — become a symbol of comfort in these ‘alternative’ times, but that's the way the digestive dissolves, and that's why ‘Oomalama’is as instantly familiar as last night's curry.
As immediate as a kick in the shins.
With the likes of Ministry marching over the hairy horizon, Eugenius and their casual like are virtually being pushed towards the mainstream.
So ‘Oomalama’ is slightly sloppy, moderately poppy and, on the ‘thank you’rollcall, credits ‘peanut butter and honey sandwiches’.
Sweet?
Hell, you haven't heard ‘Down On Me’…
It also rolls along with a breezy swagger which belies The Vaselines' (Eugenius' previous incarnation) shambling status while suggesting that, actually, this guitar-pop malarkey is a piece of piss.
What it lacks is diversity, drama and pained desperation.
Fundamentally, comparisons crucify Eugenius in the sense that Pavement, Mercury Rev, Unrest et al are pushing out the boat, the train and any passing planes, while Eugenius, erm, aren't.
‘Breakfast’ and ‘Here I Go’are just two examples of the quartet's regimental inspiration, and Eugene Kelly's vocals are rarely elevated above the pathologically dour.
Excepting the sleazy schmooze that is ‘Hot Dog’, ‘Oomalama’ lacks light and shade and the sense of abandonment that transforms a collection of good songs into a great album.
But to disqualify Eugenius from the running is to ignore the twanging power inherent in ‘Flame On’; to pass over Kelly's weary woefulness; to turn a blind ear to the plethora of lovely guitar flicks and calmly-slashed chords which litter ‘Breakfast’ and ‘Buttermilk’like mouldy cabbages down Walthamstow High Street on market day.
You'll also be overlooking some nonchalantly sly snippets of humour: the sleeve of ‘Oomalama’ features half a dozen plastic animals.
Why?
As Eugenius would probably say themselves, does there have to be a  f—ing reason?
Run-of-the-mill, but still running…
Nothing compares…
Eugene
STARLINGS
Valid
CHRIS SHEEHAN used to be a heroin  addict .
I know this from an absurdly melodramatic press release.
You'll know it from lyrics that dwell on ‘the final kill, the final thrill’, titles like ‘Shoot Up Hill’(a real place, in Kilburn, irony fans) and a cute little skull-and-crossbones on the packaging of ‘Valid’.
Now Chris Sheehan, pivotal Starling, is an ex-user, and he's clearly become psychologically dependent on using music as a cathartic way of coming to terms with his past.
That means grimy super-realist lyrics rendered on the wild side in a predictably debauched drawl; sparse, uneasy music pricked by the ghosts of previous drug mythologists Lou Reed, Nick Cave, Nico and The Jesus And Mary Chain; and the mix of self-pity and ‘you don't know how hard it was’ self-righteousness peculiar to cleaned-up addicts.
Isn't it time ex-junkies found new forms and a new vocabulary to celebrate their survival?
Evidently not.
That said, about half of ‘Valid’ is as broodingly successful as most examples of this low-life love/hate genre go.
‘Now Take That’ is a clanking, menacing collection of threats that stalks in the footsteps of Nick Cave, while ‘Unhealthy’is a thumping and insistent piece of blues-spooked vitriol.
And though previous Starlings singles were pretty much pallid takes on the Mary Chain's one wonderful trick, the screwed-up-sex prowl of ‘Sick Puppy’ radically twists — and improves — on old attempts by pushing the ominous bass and sliding beat upfront and not really bothering with guitars at all.
Nasty, but neat.
There are, of course, moments like ‘Shoot Up Hill’ that make you wish the NHS paid for and hygienically destroyed ‘Been there — done that — got it out of my system in the studio’bouts of maudlin croaking.
But then again, I guess a half-successful ‘Valid’ is better than a  f—ed-up invalid.
‘Drugs?
Me?’
Starling Chris Sheehan
THE COAL PORTERS
Rebels Without Applause
RICKENBACKER REBEL and ex-Long Ryders leader Sid Griffin rides back into town with his latest wild bunch The Coal Porters right behind him.
Sid's the kinda hombre who doesn't climb down from his saddle just to pander to the latest flight of fancy that the LA music scene has retched up, far preferring to follow his own happy trail.
He sticks to his guns and, for that reason alone, deserves a tip of the ten-gallon hat.
His Coal Porters band (a terrible pun of a name, but one that will be remembered because of it) are unashamedly traditional in a rock 'n' roll clubland sense.
Expect much slick guitar, expressive backbeat and…the occasional big surprise.
‘Stealin' Horses’ pops out of nowhere and hangs in the air, a skeletal ballad from Griffin with the accompaniment of a ghostly piano which can be heard weeping softy to itself in the basement.
It's another side to The Coal Porters' sound and Griffin's songwriting that shows they have more than one ace hidden up their sleeves.
‘Stealin' Horses’ hints at Sam Peckinpah heroics, of McGuinn's ‘Chestnut Mare’after the buzzards have got at it, and the powerful western writings of Cormac McCarthy.
The rest of ‘Rebels’ can be described as being honestly enjoyable, perhaps more fun to experience live in suitable company rather than tracking through it alone at home.
BACK TO THE PLANET
Earzone Friendly
Live Vol 1
YOU WANT indie?
You got it.
Independently distributed — by the post office — these mail-order cassettes are currently your only way of investing in the counterculture's Next Big Thing.
SE13's feisty and fabulous Back To The Planet are the Radical Dance Faction it's OK to like, a likeably ramshackle collective whose penchant for ska rhythms and reggae upholstery ought to merit them little more than outlaw status.
That their only recorded material is in rattly old tape format will no doubt unsettle the media-literate, fast-lane ‘indie’ kid of today.
Plus, their lifestyle decisions are defiantly made under the army surplus banner we cleverly call Crusty.
How much more wrong could Back To The Planet be?
And yet…
Back To The Planet are right.
Already old pals to a legion of live fans, it won't be long before they're as big as The Levellers, except they'll be excellent as well— catchy, bright, funny, infectious, everything The Levs are not, really.
And who knows, perhaps a record company will sign them!
Meantime, the sadly two-year old recordings on ‘Earzone Friendly’ will be your cassette pet.
This cut-price item contains BTTP's one confirmed classic, ‘Daydream’, the inspired job over the top of Eric Satie's ‘Trois Gymnopedies’, and a perfect introduction to vocalist Fil's charming, untutored tones.
She switches between spoken word, shouting through a megaphone with a sock in it and chirruping like a sweet but overexcitable nightingale, tracing a lineage back to Delta 5, The Raincoats and The Slits (marvellous days I can assure you).
Fil sounds a lot like you'd expect the bulimic nutcase daughter in Mike Leigh's Life Is Sweet to sing, she's got an echo box and she's gonna use it, and her slightly amateurish technique is BTTP's trump card.
Let's leave the ‘great voice’ of Anita Baker and her ilk to dorks like Nicky Cambell while we celebrate the cracked and the imperfect.
Elsewhere, on less poppy and more overtly naive-political tracks like ‘Rubb In The Cream’ and ‘Let Our Roots Breathe’, the order of the day is a kind of diet dub, which only gets overbearingly Brockwell Park on the rather trad ‘Sunshine’.
As an ‘album’, this small-scale, big-hearted seven-song companion is a lot less weird and grimy than last year's ‘Warning The Public’, but an essential thing nonetheless.
The threateningly titled ‘Live Vol 1’ is easier to live without unless you're a small convert already.
Recorded last year in Nancy, France and London, England, its nine tracks are invigorated by their environment — especially such worn-in faves as the fierce, questioning ‘London City’ and the commandingly swirly ‘You're The Judge’— but the crowd noises are infuriatingly badly mixed in, making for an imperfect peep into BTTP's spiritual home.
It's got ‘Daydream’ on it, though.
Every Back To The Planet product will have ‘Daydream’ on it if I'm in charge.
Send off for it anyway!
I'm backing Back To The Planet because when you play their tapes on your Walkman it makes you give money to tramps.
Absolutely true.

SHORT CIRCUIT
KD Lang in the charts!
Billy Ray goes Top Five!
Is C&W as weird and as rubbish and as world-threatening as all this?
STU BAILIE checks out the record shelves for oddball varieties of cowboy junkies, Tex Mex, hat acts, Canuck contenders and pony-tailed gits, and finds a couple of decent records
FLACO JIMENEZ: Partners
FLACO HAS been involved in some fun collaborations over the last couple of decades — his trembling accordion signature on Ry Cooder's ‘He'll Have To Go’ and the peppy bits on Dwight Yoakam's ‘Streets Of Bakersfield’are two good examples.
This record is a kind of respect-is-due gesture — a splurge of celeb guests , a handful of Jimenez relatives and a smattering of loopy polkas to show Flaco off as more than just another name on the studio credits.
Consequently, there's a chummy atmosphere on the record that may not always result int he most demanding,creative working mood, but there's a fond, happy ambience in the grooves which ain't bad.
THE PAINE BROTHERS: Honky Tonk Hall
LAST TIME I meet Bobby Paine was in a hotel room in Milwaukee at 3am, when myself and Brian Setzer were playing indoor golf, drinking a bit and listening to Bobby tell his mad stories about Jerry Lee, Billy Idol and sundry LA psychos — barmy late-night company!
Now that Brian is back with The Stray Cats, bassman Bobby has teamed up with his producer brother Larson and has recorded a collection of rockin' tunes that's fairly decent in a Dwight Yoakam sort of a way.
A few of the songs here appeared on Setzer's ‘The Knife Feels Like Justice’ records, but this new LP is still probably worth checking out for the rumbling ‘(Don't Sell My Daddy) No More Whiskey’.
BLUE RODEO: Lost Together
DULLARD COUNTRY Joes from Canada who've got nothing fresh to add to the runnings — just a stinky, laboured, rock-heavy thing.
‘Western Skies’, they say, is about taking acid and climbing the local mountains.
All I can say about that is that it must have been awfully feeble acid to make your visions come out so pedestrian as this.
CLINT BLACK: The Hard Way
THE DIFFERENCE between regular country acts and their rock 'n' roll equivalents is that your NME -friendly guitar-basher enjoys and is expected to try out new riffs, to be playful and weird.
The country industry, though, likes its stars to be constant and orthodox.
Like Clint Black.
With ‘Killing Time’ in '89 Clint was a thrill, a new voice, a more grainy version of that rich young smiler, Randy Travis.
But ‘The Hard Way’ is the third version of that record, and you feel a little frustrated.
A dead good singer, but, alas, no different from the way he was before.
IRIS DE MENT: Infamous Angel
YES!
PASSIONATE songs and groovy diversions and a voice that cracks and soars and makes you aware of the rich possibilities of your lot, instead of burying your feelings in a horrible, orthodox genre.
Iris has a raw style that ancestral artists The Carter Family would recognise instantly, and a facility for a great story song that never makes you feel insulted or nauseous.
Expect to hear lots more about Iris in the next year, 'cause she's better than a million of those smug Nashville fat-cats.
MARY-CHAPIN CARPENTER: Come On Come On
JIM LAUDERDALE: Planet Of Love
STACY DEAN CAMPBELL: Lonesome Wins Again
THE SORT of things that puts The Late Show set into raptures; politely rocking, coffee table country with ‘searching’ lyrics and nice tunes.
However, here at icon-torching, father-I-want-to-kill-you NME Towers, much of that received wisdom and fussy boogie won't wash.
Mary Chapin does a version of Lucinda Williams' ‘Passionate Kisses’ that's a certified snore.
Jim Lauderdale is like a neutered Dwight Yoakam, though his tribute to George Jones and Gram, ‘The King Of Broken Hearts’ suggests he could be exciting if he loosened up a taste.
Stacy Dean Campbell has the most pluck of all, a nice tonsil-trembling way that's a bit like baby Elvis.
Dull songs all round, though.
CALVIN RUSSEL: This Is Your World
A TEXAN dude that's big in France and Germany, apparently, but this record ain't gonna light up the rest of the west with its plodding, straight-forward observations and predictably worn voicebox.
Also, a wimpy, terror-free version of ‘All Along The Watchtower’ is the most superfluous thing you'll come across.
RODNEY CROWELL: Life Is Messy
SOMETIMES HIS songs are great, elsewhere he's a bit dull.
This time Rodney, a vet from the early Emmylou Harris days, teams up with Steve Winwood, Marc Cohn, Don Henley and Barry Beckett to make a record that tends towards a generic West Coast feel in bits, but also has that Springsteen-goes-broody vibe, which is sort of rewarding.
LOS LOBOS: Kiko
A REALLY fine record that shows Los Lobos in a versatile, soulful mood — miles clear of the workaday bar-room vibe that sometimes muddies up their live shows.
The mix of keening voices, dreamy storylines and unusual, far-off sounds brings to mind The Band when they were on a roll, and David Hidalgo in particular sounds like he's done his best ever work — conjuring up old ghosts and loser friends and working up a deal of sadness and unique moods from familiar instruments.
This is the kind of record that people will talk about in five years' time.
‘Remember that brill Los Lobos record from '92 that nobody bought?’ they'll say.
Don't be left out of the conversation, duende!
GRAM PARSONS: Warm Evenings, Pale Mornings, Bottled Blues
GRAM WAS a good-looking wastrel rich boy, reared in Georgia, who hung out with the Stones, played with The Byrds, discovered Emmylou Harris and released some glorious records — pioneering, sad-woozy tunes that have left their influence on ‘Let It Bleed’, ‘Dixie Narco’, ‘The Rockingbirds’ and with soon-to-be-popular Def American band The Jayhawks.
Some of Gram's classic tear-in-my-beer stuff was clearly inspired by crooner George Jones, but the best of his songs are delivered with a shiver in the throat — as with Hank Williams and Jimmie Rogers, you could practically hear the hell-hounds on his tail as he addressed old girlfriends, southern vistas, and rotten townships and morbidly looked forward to his own druggy demise.
This Australian CD is a class introduction to Parsons and his time, from his homespun days with The Shilos, through to the genesis of country rock and closing on some hard-to-get live takes, plus a few epics from ‘Grievous Angel’— his final, whacked-out testimony.
It's a great introduction and, combined with the two-on-one US import of ‘GP/Grievous Angel’ CD, it lets you hear how profoundly moving country music managed to get 20 years back.
VARIOUS: Tombstone After Dark
OUT FOR a while now, but still worth your attention due to the diversity of ace music on this sampler.
Jimmy Dale Gilmore is wild and wiggly, Nanci Griffith is captured in her old folksy form and Percy Sledge sings a Hank Williams tune — just to remind us that country music isn't simply a WASP-y preserve.
David Halley's ‘Further’ is lovely and introspective and Junior Brown is a gas; surreal honky tonk with the boomiest voice you'll hear these days.
Altogether it's a feast of credible, left-field acts.
UNCLE TUPELO: March 16–29, 1992
PRODUCED BY Peter Buck, which ain't such a recommendation in itself, since an REM by-line has as much rarity these days as a Steve Albini credit or the legend ‘from Seattle’, but Uncle Tupelo are pretty magnificent, as it happens.
The shaggy, grungy side of the band has lessened under Buck's custodianship, replaced by the bluegrass axis of banjo and fiddle on a burning version of The Lovin' Brothers' ‘Atomic Power’.
Elsewhere, like on ‘Criminals’ or ‘Shaky Ground’, you get all the weird, unresolved chording that Michael Stipe favours, and a suitably battered vocal that reaches back to the old mountain music and forward to Dinosaur Jr, Lemonheads and Nick Cave.
Uncle Tupelo seem to have left their obsession with liquor abuse to the side (‘Moonshine’ is an exception, perhaps!), but the result is a strong, indie-friendly creation that can sit proudly with all those rowdy long-hair platters.
Enjoy!
BILLY RAY CYRUS: Some Gave All
ON YER way Billy, and take yer stinky-winky record with ya!
There he is, old dog-face Cyrus on the cover, with his pony-tail and his stars 'n' stripes patch on his jeans — every inch the puko, ambitious newboy gunning for the hearts and wallets of Codger County and toting a cheesy, materialistic brand of self-belief.
The voice is a stinker and the sincerity meter rarely twitches over the course of this, then there's a cover of ‘These Boots Are Made For Walkin'’ that hums to the heavens.
Billy Ray is the culmination of the Garth Brooks trend, the triumph of marketing and conservative panty-waist over the music.

BABE ALONE'S BURNING
From the Blake Babies to ‘Hey Babe’, JULIANA HATFIELD has been crafting a deceptively sweet, unnervingly direct antidote to foxcore screaming.
DELE FADELE gets some long-distance information
Juliana Hatfield might not be a gender warrior or fight city hall, but distances herself from the herd of two-bit supposedly alternative US bar-bands by being outwardly conservative and inwardly maverick.
While most of her peers wear their hearts on their sleeves and parade their differences by churning out variations on the boss sound of the day, this Boston-based denizen sculpts seemingly light and sweet guitar-pop tunes that have spikes of anger and disenchantment buried deep inside them.
The break-up of her former group, the medium-profile Blake Babies, has left her free and unshackled on her first solo LP (the riveting ‘Hey Babe’) to create music that shares subject matter with ‘soul’— love viewed from every possible angle — but blossoms with a fiery individuality born from experience.
The biggest mistake you could make about Juliana would be to label her ‘Babe’ and only take her seriously on a superficial level.
Sure, she doesn't scream with anguish and caterwaul and present a screwed-up persona like some ‘foxcore’ groups we could name, but she's quite comfortable being a woman and there should be as many ways for women to express themselves as there are grains of sand on a non-radioactive beach.
‘Hey Babe’ 's strength is in the unnerving directness of the songs, the range of the guitar figures and the simplicity of the everyday language.
ON THE transatlantic phone from a Dallas hotel room where she's having a rest from touring America as support to the Lemonheads, Juliana is often forthright and sometimes evasive, giving short, sharp answers to my silly questions.
Even though she's not here in person, her personality comes across in terms of someone who knows exactly what she's doing and is strong in her views.
The light, fragile voice which isn't that dissimilar to the one showcased on more acoustic numbers might suggest shyness, but you can never predict what she's going to say next.
I certainly didn't expect her to actually complain about the LP she's supposedly promoting.
‘I just know that next time I can do a lot better,’ she confesses.
‘Hey Babe’ was very rushed, there wasn't much time.
I didn't have much confidence, so it's kinda weak, but I like it.
What I do isn't singing about myself, I kinda make up these little stories, I don't know where they come from…
I'm not as pathetic as the protagonist in those songs.’
Juliana Hatfield, in an ideal world, would be one of the candidates for courtship by the major labels in America who think nothing of offering the noise-for-noise sake Helmet half a million dollars to ditch an indie label for the big-time.
At least she'll do something positive and enrich the lives of thousands, not just torture people with guitars.
Is she aware of the state of play?
‘It makes me feel good to know that people want to hear my kind of music, the type of music I think is good.
But then, I feel bad for those people who want to stay independent, 'cos it's harder and harder to stay that when all the labels are being bought up.
I want to reach a larger audience: I've already made five records on indies, so maybe it's time to move on, but some younger bands are gonna find themselves pushed into the limelight when they're not ready.
They might just blow it, and make the whole scene look bad.’
The pronouncement of big statements is anathema to Juliana because she feels her point of view changes from time to time and she's afraid of saying too much in case she alienates people, but she does admit to finding life in America ‘scary’ at the moment.
‘I'm definitely getting sick of writing silly love songs.
There's only so many love songs you can write.
I'm starting to write about other things, but I'm being careful about writing political things 'cos it's really easy to sound preachy or too self-righteous in a song.
I don't want to  f— up my music by being too political.
I don't feel I have a responsibility to do that with my music.
If I wanna be political, I'll do that in my personal life, I don't see why I have to do that with music.’
When I wrote ‘Nirvana’, it was just supposed to be this positive thing about a song that made me wanna go and live , not really a political thing, like you say someone might hear that and go out and try to change things.
That could be dangerous, like people are saying heavy metal music might make people wanna go out and kill others…‘
The killer would have to be  unbalanced mentally prior to hearing the music.
‘Yeah, I suppose music can't make you go pick up an axe.
Music is good.
I like music.’
SOME PEOPLE don't.
And they don't know what they're missing.
Juliana played bass on the recent Lemonheads LP and Evan Dando has returned the favour by guesting on some ‘Hey Babe’ tracks; she says they like making music together but she couldn't be a Lemonhead, she wants to be herself.
Let's hope she continues to stun us by doing just that.
‘And hey, don't call me babe!’
Juliana Hatfield lays  down the line down the line .
NOT FAD AWAY
Are the NEW FAST AUTOMATIC DAFFODILS the last living band in Manchester?
Isn't it time they gave up the game and settled into cosy, post-stude domesticity?
Or is new single ‘It's Not What You Know’ their finest, most focused outburst of angular funk yet?
Our man in court STEPHEN DALTON puts the case for and against to FAD-head ANDY SPEARPOINT.
Knuckling under: STEVE DOUBLE
Wagnerian storm clouds gather doomily as millions of curious souls cram themselves into the multi-tiered arena of the High Court in downtown Afterlife City.
It is Pop Judgement Day, with every group in history dragged into the dock to justify their past existence.
Rapidly shaping up as today's main event are the Madchester show trials.
Cowering before a stone-faced jury is Andy Spearpoint, lyricist and singer with the New Fast Automatic Daffodils, attempting to explain why his gang of rhythmic misfits really needed to foist their multi-tentacled percussion patchworks onto a world already over-run with pop music in all its myriad hybrid strains.
Well, young man?
‘Erm…we were uncompromising .
It depends who's make the judgement, really.
Does God like The Smiths?’
He or she would be a narrow-minded twat not to, but such evasiveness does not help your case.
How would you answer charges that the New FADS were awkward, slate-grey, repetitive, charmless, self-indulgent, unfocused and dour pedlars of overly cerebral geography-student wank-noise with all the personality of a high-rise car park?
‘I probably wouldn't bother.’
Objection , your honour?
IN FACT, Pop Judgement Day hit Manchester years ago, but its effects can still be felt here today.
Spanking new trams may circumnavigate the bizarre architectural eyesore of Piccadilly — half Bulgarian showpiece plaza and half Gerry Anderson-style spaceport — but musically the city is in disarray.
Several of its most famous names decamped to London, as did half of Factory.
Many small labels have sunk without trace.
Big record companies no longer send massed talent scouts here and — judging by Terry Christian's depressingly banal pop column in the Manchester Evening News — they are not exactly missing out on buried treasure.
Even Factory's semi-legendary Dry 201 bar looks pretty ordinary this Friday afternoon, a solitary 808 Statesman huddled glumly amidst the sparse clientele.
New FAD Andy puts down his Guardian crossword, sinks his whiskey and suggests relocating to a Real Ale put he knows on the city centre's crumbling outskirts.
Formed at college, where Andy studied drama, the FADs are not local lads.
The singer was brought up in London, but two years in Leeds and five in the North West have given him an oddball Midlands-tinged accent.
Regional roots aside, the band always wisely distanced themselves from the now-dead scene — but, as Andy candidly remarks, ‘everybody said that, didn't they?
That was the great thing.
The whole stereotype was a media creation anyway, so nobody in their right mind could claim to represent the Manchester scene.’
The evil media didn't exactly rape poor innocent Manchester and its defenceless young pop stars — the whole shebang was a two-way transaction of mutual favours.
As Andy admits: ‘It certainly didn't do us any harm.
We got attention straight away, we got some kind of profile very easily.
But we don't particularly regret that the media hype has gone.’
No, because maybe even now we can credibly describe the latest New FADS single, ‘It's Not What You Know’— their first in almost a year — as their finest and biggest yet, with Andy yelping sourly across a cavernous chamber of whirling percussive dislocation.
Perhaps even comparisons with Joy Division's bruising basslines and the dry crunchiness of early, burly Happy Mondays might be permissible?
‘That's what we always were anyway, loud guitars and plenty of rhythm.
So, on that extremely simplistic level, we were the Happy Mondays,ha ha !’
Ha ha ha ha ha pardon?
‘…
Except with louder guitars.’
THOSE GUITARS have been pretty quiet since October last year, when the lackluster ‘All Over My Face’ sank with scarcely a ripple.
Since then the group have changed management, written loads of chunky new tunes and recorded their mighty second LP, ‘Body Exit Mind’, in Brussels.
Producer for both the new single and October-scheduled album was Craig Leon — he of numerous Fall credits — who has finally managed to capture the beefy FADS live sound on tape.
‘With ‘All Over My Face’ we went for a rather professional production,’sighs Andy.
‘It wasn't a particularly good song and it just sounded really ordinary.
It was bollocks , basically.
We knew we could do better than that, so we just decided to take the time and not put anything out we weren't happy with.’
However, anyone attempted to interpret Andy's vitriolic sneering in ‘It's Not What You Know’ as his reaction to a year of bitter wrangling and stifled potential should think again.
Such stroppiness would have amounted to commercial suicide after ten months of silence.
‘It's not as literal as that, it's actually quite an old song.
It wasn't supposed to be saying ‘we've been really hard done by and you're all bastards’, or anything like that.
If it was, that would probably be the last nail in our coffin.
A lot of the motivation for the lyrics is the nastier side of my mental make-up anyway.
Because the music is fairly hard, it lends itself to expressions of anger and bitterness and violent feelings rather than blissed-out loveydovey stuff.’
Nevertheless, the single is a departure in its directness and coherence.
Whilst the FADS of old went in for five-man random obscurity and ‘playing bizarre rhythms as fast as possible’, their forthcoming album boasts structure, recurring themes and even the odd polished pop song.
But when one track came dangerously close to being ‘rompalong, knees-up, power-pop anthem’ the band quickly sabotaged it by sticking ‘a cheesy drum machine behind it and turning the last two minutes into a total sonic attack’— much to the tearful bewilderment of their paymasters, left-field Belgians Play It Again Sam.
For these lads, alas, are archetypal male stude-rockers who hate bubblegum pop and worship Captain Beefheart.
What if they accidentally gave birth to something as gorgeous and life-affirming as Betty Boo's ‘Where Are You Baby?’ would they let this deformed abomination live?
‘If we thought it had something genuinely good about it, yes, but a lot of stuff is catchy and commercial because it sounds enough like everything else to be unchallenging and throwaway.
You don't have to like it in ten years’ time.
The aim is to make something people can instantly get excited about but which also stands up to close analysis in terms of being musically interesting and having some kind of content and meaning…’
Yawn yawn.
Say something outrageous or shut up.
‘Most music today is bollocks.’
Snore snore snore.
Why are you even in a band?
‘Erm…
I'm just going to the bog.’
GEORGE ORWELL claimed writing was a curse and nobody should take it up unless driven by inner demons.
Clive James suggested awarding government grants to people for not writing novels in a world already saturated with books.
Andy is healthy, happily married and admits being in his band means simply ‘running a small business’.
So are the New FADS really motivated enough to justify their valuable shelf space in rock's great library when Pop Judgement Day comes around?
‘Definitely.
The fact that it doesn't cause you immense emotional pain doesn't mean you're not committed to it.
And in the context of what's around, I think we are doing something worthwhile.
We have an uncompromising attitude sadly lacking in a lot of what's coming out at the moment, which is partly to do with not being 18 or 19-year-olds who were really into something that happened fairly recently, whose major motivation is to try and copy that somehow.
Being married, of course, Andy is presumably not in a group to pull birds?
‘No, and just as well really because we have a marked lack of success in that area!
Ha ha ha !
It's really nice being spared that motivation.’
But surely Andy is just too sensible and balanced to belong in rock 'n' roll?
‘Not really, I get too excited about it.
You can't beat playing a gig, you get such a buzz off it.
I don't feel balanced when we play live.’
Hmmmmm .
Taking into account the thundering magnificence of your new single, the jury must grudgingly return a verdict of not guilty.
Case dismissed.
Andy Spearpoint and those FAD bastards break out of the Manchester doldrums to storm the Palace
LIVE
EDITED BY STEVE LAMACQ
THE CHERRYS
‘THIS ONE's for all the people in the audience who are gonna talk to me after the show,’ beams singing Roger Daltrey lookalike Jonti.
‘It's called Foxy Lady.’
Ha ha ha!
Who says the age of irony is dead?
Not the cheery Cherrys: they are frothing pop in full, rampant effect.
With a smile that could melt a nun's heart!
So the dungaree'd bassist should be in EMF: so the woolly-hatted guitarist belongs in the Washington DC scene; so the stand-up drummer recalls King Bloody Kirt at their prime.
So The Cherrys are a colour-crazed collision between dozens of cultural juggernauts on the freeway of pop.
With stars 'n' stripes boxer shorts worn on the outside.
Who do you love?
The Cherrys kneel at the altar of the Chili Peppers and bare their bellies for a spot of sacrificing.
The bass is more funky than a fridge full of Earth Wind And Fire remixes.
Jonti jumps about, a mass of raps and vocal slaps.
No shame, no gain is the subliminal motto, and The Cherrys chase the drongo-rock dragon down to the wire.
The only problem I have with all this hectic activity is that the concept of funk-metal should have been buried under 20 feet of hyper dangerous asbestos padding before it was permitted to draw its first breath.
To their credit, The Cherrys are more to do with cartoon frenzies than the slick professionalism which seemingly warrants a Spin front cover at the drop of a bobble hat, but it's as hollow a victory as Linford Christie's Olympic Gold in the absence of Carl Lewis.
Easy come, easy go.
The Cherrys: the fruit of the loon .
THE WISHPLANTS
THE FIRST thing you notice about The Wishplants is how they make performing on stage look so good and so damn easy.
Most bands at this early stage would have trouble performing in front of their bedroom mirror.
Above the usual Fraggle style, the leaping around and smiling a lot stage presence, the Northampton four-piece have a frontman with a larger than life aura akin to Perry Farrell and Miles Hunt.
They're precisely the kinda group to resurrect your faith in new and exciting music, and this is only their tenth gig after just six months together.
By blending all the right components (PWEI, MEF, Jane's Addiction, Megas) and looking fashionably dreadlocked and cute, it's apparent why every A&R type in London is in the building tonight.
Nevertheless, the over-riding impression is that The Wishplants aren't about to be manipulated.
Mainman Saul Denton rams his indie pendence up every snubbed nose in the venue.
To say they've captured the essence of pop is an understatement.
Funky guitars copulate with abrasive melodies on songs like ‘Lucky Me’, but it's not all based on jumped-up jollification.
There's the woeful ‘Move Around’ and the surging ‘Misery’, adding dimension to their one way ticket to success.
The Wishplants have shoved themselves into a tight market gap and have found plenty of room to develop.
If practise breeds professionalism and The Wishplants are this adept now, in six months time they'll have the gap all sewn up.
And we don't even have to wait ‘til then to see them.
…
THESE PEOPLE TIE-DYED FOR YOU!
12 HOURS OF PSYCHEDELIC MADNESS
IT'S A chemically inspired match of young versus old: 12 House Of Psychedelic Madness, running (if that's the appropriate word) from six in the evening to the crack of dawn, wherein the eager, blissed-out upstarts come face to face with crinkly creatures of rock mythology.
The two main ‘attractions’, Hawkwind and Planet Gong, have seemingly been around since the dawn of music in one form or another.
Hawkwind rely extensively on a canon of work virtually unchanged since their mid-'70s ‘Space Ritual’ album.
Despite a series of lineup changes, they're still legends of the live circuit, monsters of epic rock work-outs and nightmarish electric psychedelia.
If this event is about affirming their status amongst the youthful pretenders to the acid crown, then Hawkwind and Planet Gong have loaded the dice in their favour by monopolising the prime-time slots.
This leaves their challengers with the uphill task of performing early to a half empty venue, or, in the case of SENSER, consigned to the early morning graveyard shift, by which time most of the audience has (literally) crashed out.
Still, WONKY ALICE bravely kick off with suitably weird and psychedelic poppy guitars, playing the ominous ‘Caterpillars’ with the desperation of dying men to a barren Academy.
SPITFIRE — last minute replacements for the ironically ailing Dr Phibes — dig deep as well, living up to their name by frazzling the dreadheads with some painfully raw guitar trash.
In a scene straight out of This Is Spinal Tap , wigwams stand onstage draped in white gauze.
It's hard to work out what is going on as strobes explode and the shadowy, interchangeable members of HAWKWIND (for it is they) hide inside their ethereal pyramids.
The post-psychedelic light show ensures that the daytrippers are rooted to the floor as they sit through two and a quarter hours of swirling baby images, coloured cogs and kaleidoscope wheels.
Oh, not forgetting a stack of self-indulgent musical wanderings.
Inspiring pyrotechnics may trick the trippies, but it can't hide the essentially old hat rock opera theatrics permeating every synth-splattered extravaganza.
It's like trying to turn beef steak rawk into a New Age lentilburger, not by changing the ingredients but simply enveloping it all in a laser-fried wholemeal bun and hoping that nobody will notice the difference.
‘Masters Of The Universe’, ‘Brainstorm’ and the ‘classic’‘Silver Machine’are trundled out amidst the reworkings of other old excesses.
Hawkwind used to outrage the establishment by having a hippychick stripper onstage; today they have a more wimmin-friendly dayglo dancer who couldn't outrage a paper bag, let alone dance his way out of one.
How apt.
Next up, and light years away from the real world, PLANET GONG have survived on an even more meagre diet of dodgy rock ideology and space cadet wizardry, commanded by the absurd Ronald McDonald persona of Daevid Allen — long time centrifugal force in the Land Of Gong.
So implausible, so achingly out of touch are they, no amount of Toytown trickery can disguise their ancient irrelevance.
Is that a miniature Stonehenge hovering symbolically over the stage?
Going, going…
Gong.
Verily, the Academy is a raging inferno of inertia and glazed expressions.
Is it the effects of the drugs or terminal boredom?
I can't tell.
Certainly, Senser are the only thing working overtime come four o'clock in the bloody morning.
Except upstairs, that is: climbing past mountain ranges of slumped bodies, SONIC POLLUTION and the SPIRAL TRIBE sound system are spinning real hot and happening techno trip music.
This packed, pulsating sideshow proves that to get ‘far out’ needn't lead to deathly lethargy.
Downstairs in the entrance hall the temporary tattoo stand is busily adorning undercover bank clerks with rough-and-crusty-but-it'll-wash-off-by-Monday-morning suns.
Oddly enough, the sitars have completely sold out.
Oh yes it's Hades night!
The, erm, legendary Daevid Allen gets 'em smoochin' to the softly  soulful sounds of Planet Gong.
Inset: They danced all night ( N—!)
Hawkwind opt for the lone nutter theory…
SWELL
CALM, CALM, calm.
It's dark enough onstage to hide myriad gloomy sins; dark enough even to hide the receding hairlines and sweaty T-shirts of ageing college boy rock.
Somewhere in the shadows.
Swell — all Lou Reed murmurs and blurred edges — are surfacing out of the American new wave as Pavement's sneaky, awesomely controlled alter egos, the late night loiterers left behind after the circus is over.
When the grunge gets too much, at least 1992's relentless targeting of the American underground has flushed out a few dissonant rumbles.
 It's dragged a few graceful oddities away from comparing navel fluff in their garages and shoved them on to the European circuit.
Like San Francisco's Swell — two albums old on their own Psycho-Specific label, one album new on the Mean Fiddler's Mean label — who shimmer with the kind of impossibly cool, nonchalant precision most tight-arsed British bands would die for.
Nothing particularly radical or upsetting is happening here.
It's just that Swell can generate real power, real languid grace, through stealth and self-absorption instead of strain or accident.
Sometimes — on ‘Love’— they're like the Pixies on a dump-truck full of downers.
All of the time they're introverted without ever alienating, able to craft an  elegiac atmosphere that's pretty all-enveloping, subtly freaked rather than self-consciously freaked out.
A victory on the quiet, in other words.
STEREOLAB
YOU COULD say without fear of litigation or a severe kicking behind the pub that Stereolab's greatest strengths is their ability to rip off six other bands within five minutes and still end up with an identifiable sound which is rarely overshadowed by any of its mentors.
Suicide, Velvets, MBV, Cocteaus, Spacemen and even The Monkees spring to mind at some point during Stereolab's swimming excursions into your subconscious.
Not least during their horizontally laid-back, JJ Cale-esque blues bliss outs do they sound like Spiritualized, only you'll stay awake and may even feel like shaking your fringe/rump/boots (delete according to drugs taken).
But they're at their best during songs like ‘Stomach Worm’, where a cute, simplistic beat pop tune ascends slowly into noisy chaos, thrashing around in an acid bath and trying to keep from being submerged.
It always fails, but that's half the fun.
Seaya's impenetrable, breathy French accent saves our blushes by rendering inaudible some of the worst sub-Nietzschian toss passing for lyrics you'll encounter this side of a Slayer LP, but she could sing a Happy Mondays lyric like commands from heaven.
Stereolab always look tonight as if they've got a few more tricks up their sleeve than anyone else around at the moment, and in an age where recycling the past to create a spurious version of the future is the order of the day, they may well prove to be a benchmark of quality for their times.
BREED
FOLLOWING THE theory that everyone — at some point — wants to be in a band; Breed's possessed frontman is grabbing his opportunity by its ungainly bollocks.
There's a crowd of about 30 people but, as far as Mr Breed is concerned, he is playing Wembley Stadium.
Breed are the kind of band who will begin to write a tormented love song and watch it develop into a bloody massacre.
So it's not too ridiculous to compare them to a cross between Marc Almond, Nick Cave and The Chameleons.
Occasionally mainman Simon Breed will become so preoccupied with his crazed exhibition, he neglects the art of singing into the mic, grappling with his guitar as if it were a rabid pitbull while savagely screaming and throwing himself around the stage like an out-take from Nightmare On Elm Street .
The Liverpudlian trio have sold their souls to post-punk mayhem (with an injection of screeching rockabilly) and the operation is almost a success.
Songs like the shuddering ‘Hard Cash’ and ‘Shaking The Bone’, their current single, are turbulent and torrid affairs of the heart.
Harsh and angry with undercurrents of lovelorn bitterness, but you can't imagine them amounting to more than a mere outlet for crowd frustration.
CHICKS ARE HEAVY
L7
THE STRANGEST thing, tonight, is that L7 — the new Runaways/Girlschool/Rock Follies, depending on where you stand — wriggle out of the preconceptions surrounding their rock escapades and play like demons.
Like Queen Bees under attack,they sting .
To date, it's been reasonably simple to pick holes in their Heads-Down-Take-No-Nonsense-Mindless-Boogie, but here in New York they overcome both comparisons and critics, sending a tangible buzz round a capacity crowd, already reeling after each being given a free condom by a security man on the way in.
You get the feeling you've just walked into an alternative universe where L7, free of the Women In Rock tag, reign supreme.
After a slot-it-out 18 months, which has seen them circuiting Europe and America like Nigel Mansell switched to turbo-boost, they turn up here — excuse the expression — absolutely knackered.
Yet, in heavy rock terms, they still retain an erudite edge and play with an urgency onstage that outstrips the uncharacteristically sluggish Babes In Toyland, when they played on the other side of town, two nights earlier.
They start like ‘Too Tough To Die’ -era Ramones, with ‘Deadhead’and the tell-tale ‘Ein, zwei, drei, vier’countdown to ‘Slide’— and then pummel through three or four numbers with a brightness and lethal-pop-edge that brings new life to their bludgeoned ‘Bricks Are Heavy’album (particularly the lurching ‘Everglade’, which as a 45 was as devoid of pizzazz as Catchphrase is of wit and wisdom).
‘Bricks’, their first LP for Slash with its surprise hit ‘Pretend We're Dead’, acts as a foundation stone for tonight's set, with older, dirtier material fitting nicely around it.
The Marquee crowd — a muddle of college indie kids and rock fans in assorted Gunners chic — react with an equal mix of abandon and pose, the kids at the front looking like they've got heads on springs as they crowd round the monitors.
AMIDST THE wild-ish scenes, L7 are delightfully down to earth.
After one outbreak of shoving and stage-diving they even say, with tongues steadfastly in their cheeks: ‘Be cool, the British press are here tonight’(no doubt having spotted the slowly melting figure of Sirrs, trickling away into a corner).
There is a breath of punk in what they aspire to: the Do Anything You Wanna Do line of thought that infiltrates everything from their offstage character through to their dealings with the record company.
And at the same time there's an exasperated, frayed at the edges side to this performance.
Bassist Jennifer — 12 hours' sleep in three days, we reckon — adding: ‘I'm having a really bad night tonight and I don't know what it is, but the next person who smacks the mic or stands on our gear…
I'm going to have to kill them.
It's not your fault, but unfortunately it'll be your  f—ing problem.’
This doesn't stop them lightening up later, as she sprawls offstage in a celebratory show of crowd-surfing.
Meanwhile, the structure that gave ‘Bricks Are Heavy’ its tightly cemented sound builds into a sweat-sodden climax.
And takes on a surprising amount of colour: RED, naturally.
Brick red lights, red hair, red eyes.
The inflamed four-piece come over all fiery and explosive, fuelled by belligerent tracks like next single ‘Monster’ and encore-opener ‘Shitlist’(a universally appealing piece of spite).
They may lean towards simple solid-riffing more than the likes of the Babes or the dark Hole, but here, this alternative heavy steel sound has some ecstatic, if not inventive moments.
Both guitarists Suzi and Donita revel in the chugging momentum, epitomised by the guttural grind of ‘Wargasm’ and ‘Mr Integrity’.
Compared to their last visit to the UK and the big Astoria show — which was OK, but felt overlong — this turns out to be a near-perfect delivery of their contrasting semi-dumb music and ultra-sharp attitude.
Even in the volcanic heat, they were dead cool.
Marquee cha-cha: Jennifer and Donita (inset) keep cool in the volcanic New York heat…
…
Then flip out.
Jennifer gets really carried away
STRANGELOVE
WITH MILLIONS of spotty young upstarts being so alarmingly eager to please at the moment, I guess that the slightly askew likes of Strangelove should be welcomed with open charms .
Eschewing the numbing Neds-by-numbers norm (have half an idea, will tour), Strangelove are the miserable bleeders in the sunny side-up house of fun.
Given that neither The Blue Aeroplanes nor Levitation have exactly torched the charts with tunes of fire, the chances of a group formed by ex-pats from both of said bands formulating an instant pop nirvana appears about as likely as Spurs winning the Premier League.
Fittingly, Strangelove are to three-minute melodies what Gary Lineker is to goalkeeping.
They're a broody looking fivesome, all dark clothes and darker expressions.
The atmosphere is hardly lightened when guitarist Alex Lee takes a pissed stagediver to task, but one suspects that this is precisely the kind of turmoil Strangelove get their kicks from.
Unfortunately, the gloom remains resolutely unlifted by the music.
Non-specific janglings?
Impenetrable ponderings?
They've got the lot, dragged along by singer Patrick, a John Lydon sneer-a-like in an Oxfam suit.
It's all sturdy and dense and impressively intense, but it amounts to little more than a grumpy grumble from the arty side of town.
Strangelove are more ‘interesting’ than invigorating, without ever really explaining the need for their nerve-wracked noise.
Which is a bit like building a hydrogen-powered engine and hiding the designs under your bed.
Strangelove?
Very strange, love.
FADCHESTER BRAVES ON!
NEW FAST AUTOMATIC DAFFODILS
REMEMBER WAH-wah pedals?
Remember ill-focused jiggle-rock with pretend funk basslines and some git grunting over the top?
Well, hey!
There's none of it here tonight.
At the turn of the decade, however, there was a huge sulphurous swamp full of that sort of anaemic disco for people with beanbags for legs, and the New FADs nearly fell into it.
By rights they should now be quietly decomposing in Manchester, having tried out their experimental rhythm rock surrealism only to discover that self-analytical dance with guitars could not really compete with belching ego-Mancs who wanted to be adored or abhorred.
The New FADS missed the boat, but, well look here, they've built themselves a new one.
And this one is solid steel and beautifully streamlined.
The new New FADS (how much newer could you get?) have re-upholstered their sound.
Shiny-eyed bassist Justin now manipulates Joy Division-funk basslines of a magnitude normally reserved for space-mission documentaries.
Guitarist Dolan is no longer afraid-to-rock, hammering Iron-girder metal riffs on to the FAD groove.
Neo-suedehead singer Andy appears to have gone through a second puberty, his former growling style of delivery having fallen down an octave well and climbed out deeper and darker.
It's all a lot less frail now.
A lot more imposing.
Where before, half the amusement of seeing the New FADS play was seeing whether the five unlikely groovers could carry off their groove thing without sounding like A Certain Ratio after one too many spliffs, now there is a confidence, and with it comes a hint of threat.
Dance it may be, but it's the surliest dance imaginable.
‘This is what this song is all about/This is what this song is all about’ rants Andy in the voice of a grizzly bear with PMT.
Nobody has any idea what he's on about in the mangled trance opening song ‘Bong’, but at least there's some conviction and fire.
The new songs, which follow the brief rewind through absurdo oldster ‘Fishes Eyes’, are big, bold rough-house dance things which actually cohere rather than drift into percussive jam no-man's-land.
The single ‘It's Not What You Know’, a remarkable welding together of headband aesthetics and hypnotic syncopation, is a curmudgeonly diamond of a song.
‘American Money’, ‘Kyphos’ and ‘Patchwork Lives’are tunes of distinction too, super imposing, thanks to a phrase here and a lugubrious melodic twist there, a veil of real-life grime over the swaying dance beats.
This time round, as a packed, stomping and sweating Camden Palace demonstrates, the New FADS have got the balance right between body and mind.
As a smouldering, glowering, gritty dance-rock sound-system, they are a mini-triumph.
There is a backwash to all this, however: as a stage-show they are less than shadow-puppets on the wall.
Being only marginally better looking than The Farm doesn't excuse instant capitulation when it comes to performing, and tonight, apart from Andy's caged pussycat prowling, mostly lost in dry ice, they might as well have pulled the curtains.
When the New FADS get some go-go dancers, some Elton John glasses for Andy and a cod-piece for Dolan, they will be a glorious live event indeed.

EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
LIFE AFTER A-LEVELS
If you have just gained the exam results you need for a place at university or college, or for a job, than congratulations!
But if your exam results weren't what you expected, or if you are not sure what to do next, here is some useful information and advice.
so you didn't make the grade
For years everyone around you — family, parents, even magazines and newspapers, have been telling you: ‘Work hard, Pass your exams, Your whole future depends on this’.
So you worked hard.
You passed GCSE, and perhaps other exams as well.
You went into the 6th form or to college and you worked hard.
You passed their exams.
You went on working hard.
Now there's a piece of paper saying your grades aren't good enough.
It's not surprising if you feel like a failure.
But you are not alone and you are not a failure.
Not getting the exam results you expected is a lot more common than you might think.
Around 60% of actual A-level results are different from those predicted — the majority lower grades.
Of course, conditional offers from universities and colleges are generally made on predicted results.
That's why, every year, thousands of people have to change their plans.
This year, there has been another problem affecting some people who applied through UCCA or PCAS ;it seems there was a fault with the new UCCA equipment which is used to process all applications through the central systems.
An apparently large number of applications were either delayed or temporarily lost.
If your original application was rejected by some or all of the institutions you listed, this might have been because it was delayed and did not reach the admissions tutor until after the course was full.
If you think you are one of the applicants affected by this problem, it might be worth while contacting institutions again to ask if they would consider your application now.
On the other hand, there might be a different reason altogether why you didn't get any offers, or why you didn't get the exam grades you hoped for.
Perhaps you have been unwell or under stress.
Or maybe you didn't work hard enough, or had chosen subjects you really didn't enjoy, or you just weren't up to it.
Be honest with yourself.
Get advice.
Then you can work out what to do next.
what to do next
The first thing to remember is that you have not necessarily lost your place even if you haven't quite made the grades required.
It all depends on what the exam results are like nationally, how popular the course is, and whether the admissions tutor was particularly impressed by your application.
Ring up and ask, though  it's best to wait a few days until tutors have worked out exactly what position their courses are in.
If you have lost your place, UCCA or PCAS will write and tell you so promptly.
You now have several options, so take a bit of time to think through what you really want to do — and get the best advice you can.
You could re-sit one or more exams.
Or you could stay another year at school or college and re-take the subjects you failed.
Talk this over with your parents, teachers and careers officer.
How would you feel staying on at school when all your friends had left?
How important is the particular course you chose?
Might the university expect better grades than they asked for previously?
Find out before you decide.
You could look for an alternative course at a different university or college.
This is probably what most people do and is usually successful.
But don't make decisions in a panic.
People who do sometimes find out they are very unhappy, either because the course is not what they expected, or because they just don't like the institution.
clearing
The Clearing System is designed to help people looking for an alternative place.
The idea is to match suitably qualified applicants with institutions which have vacancies.
Clearing starts on 26 August this year.
It is not until then that official information on course vacancies will be published.
But many universities and colleges are already advertising their courses in NME and the national press.
Most give telephone numbers you can ring for more information, and many will tell you over the phone if they are likely to offer you a place.
Do look at different courses from those you applied for originally.
You might well find something that is exactly right for you that you didn't even know about earlier.
But if you are interested in a very popular subject, such as psychology or graphic design or law, do apply as soon as possible.
These are the course which will fill their vacancies rapidly.
From 26 August, the official UCCA and PCAS vacancy listings will be published in the Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers.
They will also be available on several databases.
Your local Careers Office almost certainly has access to these and can help you.
These listings contain up-to-date details of all vacancies in all institutions in the UK.
results better than expected?
Although it is less common than getting lower grades than predicted, some people get much better results and want to consider changing their plans accordingly.
If you are in this position, and want to change your plans for higher education, do get advice from the Careers Service.
There is a quite complicated procedure for people who have accepted offers from universities or colleges, but want to re-apply elsewhere after receiving their results.
what if you've been treated unfairly?
If you are convinced that the grades you have been given are not correct, you can ask for a re-mark or for a re-assessment.
Both take time and cost money.
Your school or college are the best people to advise you.
getting help and advice
All the Careers Services will be running an On Course help and advice service from 21 August to the time when higher education courses actually start.
Specially trained careers  advisers can help you think through your choices, give you impartial advice about your suitability for different opportunities, and help you find the right course.
They also have access to up-to-date information through a computer database.
What's more, this service is entirely free.
If you aren't sure where to find your nearest Careers Office, look in the Phone Book under ‘Careers’.
Of course, your school or college know you and know what you are capable of, they are an excellent source of advice.
BBC and ITV both run excellent free helpline services staffed by trained careers advisers, and will be broadcasting special programmes to help A-level and BTEC students.
Whatever you decide to do next, good luck.

BR YOU EXPERIENCED?
In the wake of your SHOCK HEADED PETERS piece, I think you should know that Karl Blake hasn't worked for British Rail for the past year and a half and is currently an art student in Sheffield.
Not only that, but he is still hugely involved in music and has a new Shock Headed Peters album coming out in September.
Titled ‘Several Headed Enemy’ it's on his own label through World Serpent Distribution.
Additionally, he's been working with Left Hand Right Hand, who've just toured the States, while his other musical activities have seen him involved with British Racing Green and Danielle Dax, with whom he plays bass from time to time.
•It seems that Danielle Dax's ‘Pop Eyes’, once a contender in the NME indie charts, could also be up for re-release through WSD.
And could be that other Blake-Dax goodies are on the way — though this one hasn't made it out of rumoursville at present.
HUGHES YOUR ILLUSION
A few months ago NME cover stars SEAN HUGHES and CATHAL COUGHLAN announced that they were bringing out an LP together.
Have you any details?
Also, am I right in saying that the aforementioned album features none other than NME man Sherman?
Oh — and just one more thing.
Do you have any details about Sean Hughes doing any UK live dates, or, perhaps, another TV series?
•Sherman emerged from his sonic Orbitarium but looked flustered when I mentioned the album, denying any participatory interest in the Hughes-Coughlan partnership.
‘I only know that they are working together’ he announced mysteriously before disappearing into the galaxy as the sound of an old Kraftwerk record filled the air.
The Kitchenware Records spokesperson, brought up on Newcastle Brown, was more down to earth.
‘Sean and Cathal did record a demo,’ he claimed, ‘but it was a bit of a mess and the latest news is that they might try again, maybe in September.’
As for Hughes' own career, everything seems to be on course for world domination.
Around January-February next year, there'll be a series nattily titled Up Yours With Sean Hughes, while further Sean's Shows are in the pipeline.
A tour has been pencilled in for November but, if you can't wait, Sean's management would like to remind you that there's a video around called Sean Hughes — Live And Seriously Funny.
Then they would, wouldn't they?
DIFFERENT KIND OF BLUE
The BLUE AEROPLANES discography was much appreciated.
But guess what?
I have some information to add to it!
I possess an album by The Art Objects titled ‘Bagpipe Music’, released on Heartbeat Records in 1981.
The band line-up includes Gerard and Wojtek and is clearly the Aeroplanes in prototype form.
The album is remarkably well-packaged, complete with a gatefold lyric sheet which you can convert into a poetry pamphlet, while the music is diverse and includes a radical re-working of the ‘Batman’ theme, some beat poetry and Aeroplanesque R&B.
It's incredible to think this is a debut album for it far outstrips the Aeroplanes' first ‘proper’ album, which seems badly-produced and shabby in comparison.
•According to Nick, the track listing for the album is .
And, checking back, the Sounds review of the time (in which journalist Rab claims that he's had a tape since November 1980) provided the release with a five star rating, while NME was mildly less enthusiastic, observing that ‘it's an odd LP, naturally flawed and imperfect and rather stilted in places but nonetheless a worthy attempt at  indisciplinary entertainment.’
BYSSHE STREET KIDS
Could you find out what has become of SHELLEYAN ORPHAN?
Do they still exist or are ‘Helleborine’ and ‘Century Flower’to be the only albums to mark their existence?
•The message is brief — Shelleyan Orphan are alive and well and still signed to Rough Trade, who, in mid-October, will be releasing an album that answers to the name of ‘Humroot’.
Happy endings — you can't beat ‘em!
LIFE IS SWEET
What's happened to RACHEL SWEET, once pride of Akron and a Stiff princess?
•These days she's pretty much engaged in an acting career, although she did turn up in John Waters' Hairspray in 1988 to render Barbara Lynn Ozen's title song, which duly appeared on the soundtrack album.
More recently the US Rhino label released ‘Fool Around’, a retrospective that includes ‘Be Stiff’ and her cover of Elvis Costello's ‘Stranger In The House’.
MANGE TWO
I read in the studio magazine that NEIL ARTHUR, once of Blancmange, was recording one more.
Have you any details?
•Arthur, after six years in the wilderness, has signed to Chrysalis and recently began recording a series of tracks with producer Phil Bodger, all of which the label regards as potential singles.
Asked where he's been since he and Stephen Luscombe went their separate ways, the man who once lived on the ceiling claims: ‘Apart from trying to find the best dog in the world, I've worked on film scores, including one for an animated film, several pieces for Channel 4 documentaries as well as the incidental music for a Radio 4 play.
At first I thought I'd been commissioned to rewrite The Archers theme.
Alas not.’
News is that the first single, ‘One Day, One Time’, will emerge some time during September, while an album now seems a certainty for 1993.

IT WAS getting embarrassing.
All those interviews, with every journalist involved asking Moore, Ranaldo, Gordon and Shelley about their reactions to Nirvana's success.
One mag even ran the headline Has Success Passed Sonic Youth By ? during recent weeks.
Thankfully, ‘Dirty’, the Sonics' recent Geffen album, entered the UK Top Ten during the first week of release and, even if it has a long way to go to equal the sales of ‘Nevermind’, things could be taking a turn for the better.
For NME 's part we offer a celebratory discography, though the many US and Euro Sonic offerings have been omitted in order to keep the listing within the bounds of reason.
We love you, you big dummies

FRED FACT
‘MIA HAS a talent for mothering, the way some people have green fingers for gardening or an ear for music,’Woody Allen commented during recent child custody battle proceedings.
He certainly had a point, for Mia Farrow has raised 11 kids in all.
Little wonder, then, that the top of the US Hot 100 currently reflects a nationwide interest in babies.
For, at the time of writing, at Number Two is TLC 's ‘Baby, Baby, Baby’, co-produced by Kenny ‘Babyface’ Edmonds, the same producer sharing the credits of Boyz II Men 's chart-topping ‘End Of The Road’.
Additionally, the same Top Ten houses Sir-Mix-A-Lot 's ‘Baby Got Back’.
No Babes In Toyland perhaps, but all-in-all, more like a crèche than a tally of hits.
Perhaps the whole trend really got underway in 1953 when both Teresa Brewer and ill-fated R&B singer Tommy Edwards logged separate hits with ‘Baby, Baby, Baby’, while the even more short-lived Frankie Lymon charted with ‘Baby, Baby’ four years later, and yet another R&B star, one Billy Williams , notched a ‘Baby, Baby’hit during 1958.
For a while it seemed that the whole black music scene had a fixation about penning songs with titles formed entirely around the same noun,Sam Cooke adding to his bank balance via ‘Baby, Baby, Baby’(1963) while James Brown band singer Anna King and Bobby Byrd provides a classic of the same title during '64.
Since then there's been such winners as ‘B-A-B-Y’(Carla Thomas , 1966 and Rachel Sweet , 1978), ‘Baby, Baby’(Eighth Wonder , 1988) and ‘Baby’(Halo James , 1990), the Mechanical Copyright people announcing a year ago that their database, at that point, contained 81 songs called ‘Baby, Baby’, 22 titled ‘Baby, Baby, Baby’ and even one called ‘Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby’!
The first hit record to ever mention a baby though?
Well, there was certainly a best-seller titled ‘Baby Shoes’ by The American Quartet , a vocal group, back in 1911.
However, the earliest worthwhile baby-linked recording was arguably Bessie Smith 's 1923 recording of Clarence Williams ’‘Baby Won't You Please Come Home’.
Not that Williams and Smith were the ideal partnership.
For the songwriter-pianist-producer led the blues queen to believe that she was signed to Columbia Records, when, in fact, she was actually signed to Williams and he was pocketing half of every recording fee.
The Baby parade has continued ever since, encompassing such ditties as ‘I Found A Million Dollar Baby In A Five And Ten Cent Store’, ‘You Better Keep Babying Baby (Or Your Baby's Gonna Bye-Bye You)’, and ‘Baby Let Your Drawers Hang Down’, the latter being performed at Babe Connors' Club in St Louis, where the girls did bumps and grinds on a mirror floor.
As for producer/singer songwriter Babyface himself, he shares his professional name (given him by Bootsy Collins ) with a song that was a US Top Ten hit for four different artists during 1926.
In 1948 history repeated itself when the song was revived and proved a US Top 20 for four more acts.
Even then, that wasn't the end of things.
With the emergence of rock,Little Richard took the song and wop-bama-lammed it into the charts (1958) to be followed in turn by Bobby Darin (1962).
And when disco became dominant, ‘Baby Face’ became a favourite all over again, as New York's Wing And A Prayer Fife And Drums Corps turned the by-now  dog-eared ditty into an international hit during 1976.
Little wonder that Bobby Troup , of ‘Route 66’ fame, was once moved to pen ‘Baby, Baby, All The Time’!
Young Patsy ‘Eighth Wonder’ Kensit displays the style and poise that has made her a Hollywood superstar.
Sort of.

An open letter to the NME and Morrissey from Johnny Rogan
THE MOMENT Morrissey unfurled that Union Jack I knew he was in trouble, I assumed that the ‘Is Morrissey A Racist?’ debate was a discredited old chestnut, but now it's back, bigger than ever.
The allegation is dangerous and insulting to Morrissey, especially when you consider that he has never publicly espoused racist views.
In the aftermath of the unfortunate furore over ‘Panic’, the Smiths played an Anti-Apartheid gig, a fact which deserved a passing mention in your round-up.
However, the NME is right to stress the alarming cumulative effects of Morrissey's flirtation with right-wing imagery.
It is extremely disconcerting, and the Madness debate provided a salutary lesson for Morrissey, as well as ourselves.
What the NME 's five-page article really underlines is the contradictory and capricious nature of Morrissey himself.
Yes, he was fascinated by Suedehead and its lurid tale of violence against blacks and homosexuals, but don't forget that as a kid he had a strong affection for gore and horror in general.
He clearly enjoyed the vicarious thrill of reading about grisly murders and thoroughly enjoyed The Murderers' Who's Who .
One might have expected a sadistic Nightmare On Elm Street lyric to emerge from such interests, but instead he wrote the wonderfully moving ‘Suffer Little Children’ and later made a point of condemning Myra Hindley.
Such surprise twists and seeming contradictions are typical of the man.
By contrast, his most romantic song (‘There Is A Light That Never Goes Out’) eulogised violent death as the perfect goal.
His work, image and public pronouncements still veer wildly from pacifism to violence, from obsessive love to profound hatred, from commendable sensitivity to unrestrained cruelty.
He wants me dead, of course, but there have been other targets in the past, like Thatcher and high-street butchers.
Conversely, he retains a gallery of obsolete idols, whom I'm sure he will love for ever.
The fan and the fanatic are almost interchangeable.
It's hardly surprising then, that we get confused by the signals he gives out — now more than ever.
My gut reaction is that Morrissey is NOT a racist.
Despite the catalogue of comments, there is precious little in his past or present to support such a contention.
He moved quickly from the pulp of Suedehead to more healthy tomes such as Sex And Racism and Diary Of A Harlem Schoolteacher .
Enlightened stuff — and fully supported by Morrissey.
I've seen evidence of his denouncing racial prejudice in others, and it greatly impressed me.
We would all do well to remember that, and not transform a debate about right-wing imagery into a witch hunt.
That said I've also been taken aback by Morrissey's oddly derogatory remarks about Pakistanis as an 18-year-old and, without dwelling on them, I must say I found such flippant adolescent observations infuriatingly inconsistent with his general world view.
Even now, it seems a strange contradiction, but not a sinister one.
But that was all a long time ago, wasn't it?
Perhaps, in retrospect, I was over-kind in interpreting the offensive ‘Bengali In Platforms’ as a belated working through of petty teenage bigotry.
A harsher critic would have gone for the jugular and claimed that this was a blunt reiteration of those dormant adolescent prejudices.
I still give Morrissey the benefit of the doubt on this, even through his backward looking ‘patriotism’ makes me stop and rethink.
The NME stresses Morrissey's comments about the vileness of reggae and black music in general.
It would have been prudent to add his long-standing love of Tamla Motown to qualify that viewpoint.
He certainly doesn't hate all black music.
In any case, the correlation between musical tastes and racial prejudice is a complex argument — the ska-loving skinhead brigade prove that.
I find Morrissey's latest ‘racially inspired’ songs to be uncontroversial compared to ‘Bengali In Platforms’.
‘The National Front Disco’ is such a self-evidently silly title and the sentiments and tone so obviously satirical that you'd have to be pretty blinkered to be offended by it.
‘England for the English’?
If Morrissey can't be allowed to write in the third person using a character, without people automatically assuming the views expressed are his own, then we've got problems too.
It's the other trappings that I find irksome — particularly the Union Jack.
Perhaps he regards the flag as a suitable prop to emphasise the sentiments of ‘Glamorous Glue’, but he well knows its other connotations.
Morrissey's irony loses its appeal when he messes with such a powerful symbol.
I'm sure Morrissey is arrogant enough to believe that he can reclaim the Union Jack and even the entire skinhead movement for his own ‘little England’ fantasies and subtly satiric purposes.
If so, this is a sad delusion.
Last year, Morrissey told the NME : ‘I am incapable of racism’ which, in turn, prompted me to exonerate him from any underlying racist intent in his work and to conclude, ‘the liberal cycle appears to have been completed’.
Perhaps we both spoke too soon.
I hope not.
If Morrissey is making comments based upon a private mythology, then he ought to realise that a hell of a lot is lost in translation.
The fabled golden age of England that he apparently yearns for is merely his lost youth in disguise.
Like Michael Jackson, he seems intent on recreating something he never had.
In his songs he appears to realise that the dear old Blighty that he glorified has been reduced to a sorry Union Jack T-shirt on a frustrated football supporter.
His attitude to England seems terribly confused, as one might expect from a person who despises royalty but brandishes the cross of St George.
Morrissey's ‘Englishness’ is somewhat ironic when you consider that his parents and his entire extended family only arrived here during the '50s.
As the son of new immigrants, he has experienced his own share of cultural adjustment, a point that's easily forgotten.
And what are we to make of his comments while in Dublin: ‘It's good to be back home’.
I trust that if he tours Eire or Northern Ireland during the summer he won't be insensitive enough to parade the Union Jack there.
Morrissey deserves to be quizzed relentlessly on his attitude towards the Asian community, Asian culture, the NF, Britain's generation and the myth of ‘Englishness’.
It would be useful to learn how he reconciles his vision on these matters with his work as a songwriter and performer.
Having said that, I think we should be wary of falling into the trap of dictating to Morrissey what he should write about, or in what tone.
I, for one, would still prefer the mocking irony of ‘The National Front Disco’ and ‘We'll Let You Know’to the finger-pointing sloganeering of a ‘Margaret On A Guillotine’or ‘Meat Is Murder’.
That's just personal taste.
I realise Morrissey's ambiguity on such subjects as race and sexuality will frustrate those who feel that a firm stance is necessary in the current political climate.
Morrissey, of course, prefers arch playfulness and that is his prerogative as a person and a songwriter.
Those who play with fire, however archly, must expect to get their fingers burnt once in a while, and when ironic lyrics are allied to questionable public utterances and clearly provocative imagery, then it is reasonable to question the man's motives and intentions.
So, Morrissey — where does fashion end and fascism begin?
Do tell?
Johnny Rogan, author of Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance 
HEAVEN KNOWS ETC
Yesterday (August 9) was supposed to be one of the greatest nights of my life.
I was supposed to see Morrissey again.
I had waited 385 days to see him, the one I love.
I was so excited, I was actually going to see him, he was going to be there and so was I.
I suspect that people are laughing by now, but I don't care.
Morrissey means everything to me and I'm not bothered by people who laugh at me, I really don't care, I love Morrissey, end of story.
I knew before I went that I would cry that day, but I thought it would be because he was standing in front of me, not because he wasn't standing in front of me.
When I arrived and was told he wasn't appearing I was so devastated.
It felt as if my whole world had come crashing down on me.
I couldn't believe it, I just cried and cried.
People laughed at me but I don't care.
I wasn't going to see Morrissey and at that point the whole of Finsbury Park could have been laughing and it would not have mattered.
I assume a lot of people will laugh at Morrissey for this and the Glastonbury thing will be dragged up again.
I don't care, Morrissey is still wonderful and I still love him as much, if not more than I used to.
When I was told why he couldn't play I just cried even more.
How could anyone be so cruel?
I never imagined Morrissey fans as being cold and brutal people.
How could they do it to him?
How could anyone ‘boo’ a person as wonderful as he?
I imagine all these Madness fans have never felt an emotion in their life.
Do they not understand how much people like myself love Morrissey?
Whoever threw that orange and that 50p deserve to die in the same M3 pile-up as Johnny Rogan: they wouldn't be missed.
I love Morrissey, but who could ever love them?
I don't know if I will ever forgive Madness' fans: they took away my beloved Morrissey.
I can't think of a worse crime.
I can.
Concentration camps in Serbia.
Starving millions in Africa.
War in Northern Ireland.
Babies being stolen.
Innocent people spending 15 years in prison.
An Indian woman being torched at a bus-stop.
Is that enough for the time being?— IM
THE MOZ PIT
It's only a thought, but is it possible that the person who threw the carton of orange juice and 50p piece at Morrissey at the Madness (Madness , not Morrissey ) gig was not some National Front yob but someone who felt that draping oneself in a Union Jack — still, like it or not, a symbol of racism — is itself racist?
Morrissey should not be so arrogant as to think that he can, expecting no recrimination or criticism, use racist imagery without anything but the most ambiguous of reasons.
‘The last truly British people you will ever know,’— some hope, or some despair?
No-one knows any longer when Morrissey is being sarcastic and when he is trying to awaken us to something.
Possibly, as someone new to The Smiths and their legacy, I simply am not used to Moz's sense of humour but, really, that joke's not funny anymore.
Let's examine why Morrissey might have cuddled the Union flag.
One, he might have wanted to show his national pride.
Possible, but if I was a BNP yob I'd think he was taking the piss and would throw something, and if I wasn't, I might throw something anyway because nationalism stinks — keep those ‘Ethnic Cleansing’ concentration camps in your mind.
Two, he might have been reclaiming the flag for non-racists.
Great, but cue missiles.
Three, he might have been taking the piss, provoking the crowd.
Here come those coins.
Maybe he just likes the pattern on the flag.
I dunno.
But don't kid yourself.
Morrissey is no idiot.
He must have suspected that a Madness gig would attract a football crowd.
Even is he wasn't, he must have been aware that there were some yobs there.
To go onstage in the flag is to be a 50p magnet, no matter what it might mean in an ideal world.
Don't go feeling sorry for him: he has more power than you'll ever have.
He probably relishes this controversy.
You'll have your own battle to fight: let Morrissey fight his.
He's hardly a bloody martyr for being hit by a carton of juice, is he?
He's a pop singer, not Jesus — IM
LAST NIGHT I DREAMT SOMEBODY LOVED ME
In the second week of June 1974 this page (who are you, Marvo the Memory Woman?— IM) hosted the opinions of a passionate young lad from the North.
Ardent and sound.
The author of this commentary?
Our very own Steven Morrissey.
Doubtless enamoured as he was to see his name in print, I hope that now, by use of the same medium, he will understand my thoughts which I sent with equally heartfelt intensity: so where the  f— was Morrissey at Finsbury Park on Sunday?
Like thousands of other fans I was truly disappointed at his unannounced withdrawal from the Madness gig.
Although I managed to flog my tickets to a couple of touts, this month's expenditure still leaves 40 quid unaccounted for.
If Morrissey mocks the hand that feeds him, let he himself be mocked by the words that serenade him: ‘This is the last song that I'll ever sing — well I've changed my mind again.
Goodnight and thankyou’—‘Truly Disappointed’, Morrissey.
LAST OF THE FAMOUS INTER-CITY PLAYBOYS
Mozza: you're the one for me, gitty.
When will you realise that your fans are the ones who keep your career alive?
We're not going to stop buying your records (always, always the cop-out — IM) but we're not going to put up with your childish behaviour forever.
To pull out of the Sunday Madness gig when you did was lower than low.
‘Everyday Is Like Sunday’— I just hope they're not all as crap as this one turned out to be.
I just wasted a whole day to see someone who couldn't be bothered to turn up.
SWAYED HEAD: THE BOY WITH THE COIN IN HIS SIDE
Gosh, I was so surprised to see skinheads at a Madness gig.
That bunch of skins in the moshpit sure showed their true colours with Nazi rallying cries of ‘Morrissey's a wanker’ and their brown-shirt favourite ‘OO the  f—in' 'ell are you?’
But their best move of the day was throwing that Union Jack over his shoulders.
Bet the poor lad didn't even know it was there.
BONEHEAD DRAG
I wish to congratulate all those people who hurled bottles of piss (It's getting wilder with every letter.
I must say I never go out without my handy bottle of piss — IM) at Morrissey — the useless shit deserves it.
He certainly shot himself in the foot, pulling out of Glastonbury and playing Finsbury Park.
I believe at Glastonbury he would have blended well with the bill: at Finsbury Park he stood out like a sore thumb.
People around me stated ‘Oh hell, it's that poncy twat from The Smiths that loves flowers.’
This response was to be expected.
Morrissey stood out from the bill in that he's not yobbish.
But otherwise, he fitted perfectly: this was a day of eccentric pop, the last of England.
He was a fool to expect anything other than he got, however: surely only vanity could have made him think he could seduce a mob of Madness fans?
And he's certainly big enough to draw his own crowd, just as large as Madness.
How about a free concert, Morrissey?
Whatever the reasons for your action, you know it would earn goodwill — IM 
SHEILAS TAKE A BOW
Due to the pre-UK release — ha ha — of ‘Your Arsenal’, much is forgiven concerning that dreaded disappearance from Australia last year (He doesn't just do it here then — IM), but a snappy return trip would not go astray in the hearts of the young distraught fans, please please please…
I know it's gonna happen someday.
We are waiting and trying not to lose faith, but you see we're suffocating…oh my shiftless body.

Hey kids!
You want filth about big names, huh?
How about STAVROPOPALOPULADIS, a Greek man who never washes?
Failing that, what about MADONNA, ever so slightly lapsed Catholic of pop's parish?
The Mad one turned up at a recent New York gig of fabulous, trendy, baggy-type band with organ, THE CHARLATANS (UK).
She got backstage too, climbing over CHER, FRANK SINATRA, LIZ TAYLOR and the other top stars queueing to kiss the hand of the majestic TIM BURGESS.
Unfortunately THE CHARWALLAS (UK) were either too drunk or too gobsmacked to say anything to the pointy-chested one, only managing a mumbled ‘Hi’.
Unfortunately, Madonna took this to be an indication of the lads' state, and took her leave.
Would you let your daughter sleep with these lads, namely SUEDE?
Yes, probably.
Perhaps Madonna should have a chat about the pop ethics with these young hopefuls.
At the photo shoot for Suede's forthcoming NME feature, photographer KEVIN CUMMINS was snapping the band through a cardboard crucifix-shape.
First to the lens was BRETT ANDERSON, and with his unfeasibly long arms he took to the shape perfectly.
However, BERNARD, the guitarist, refused to do the shot.
Why?
Because he didn't want to offend his mum and dad, devout Catholics.
So much for rock rebellion, eh?
Now here's what we here at Public NME call smart.
Shy, retiring MINISTRY frontman AL JOURGENSEN, currently terrifying America as part of that annual disaster called Lollapalooza, has taken to walking into nightclubs with a megaphone, and yelling ‘I am Satan, take this  f—ing dance music off.’
What's more, he's got a Bones Tec, a roadie devoted solely to the placement and safe keeping of the animal bones hanging  off the Jourgensen-stand.
Unfortunately, Mr Bones takes his work home with him, and he's been making members of the LUSH sick by bringing the skulls of baby birds to dinner.
However, Lush have recently hardened-up, and MIKI and CHRIS have partaken in the Lollapalooza Bile Ritual, in which a member of the crew feeds (those of a nervous disposition skip this bit — Green-faced Ed) a seven-foot-long plastic tube into his gut via a nostril, into which a quart of lager, a squirt of tomato ketchup and a portion of chocolate sauce are pumped.
The whole lot is then regurgitated and given to mugs to drink.
Miki & Chris eagerly gulped the resulting mess down, but it was all too much for WILLIAM REID of the MARY CHAIN, who bottled out altogether.
No-one has yet managed to get ICE CUBE to sup on the drink, but hopefully Paraquat can be added to the mixture.
Too late department: leading wearers of dust-masks ALTERN 8 took the stage at Stafford's Bingley Hall last weekend with a special guest star, an African witch-doctor flown in specially for the occasion.
Amid much ritual and farting about, the doc and the daft ravers pronounced rock dead.
Next week, in recognition of this magnificent feat,Public NME will be devoting the entire page to care of your dust mask.
Leading European and member of the committee for Anglo-Bengali relations, MORRISSEY shocked the publishing world recently.
Following his massive success with Johnny Rogan —The Severed Head , Morrissey intends to write his own tome comprising a load of pictures and the great one's own captions.
‘Great idea’ said Britain's publishers, unfurling their collection of fine antique banknotes.
Unfortunately, they rolled them up again quick when they found out that Moz was after 40 grand for the privilege.
Rumours that the great man has employed MARK THATCHER as his literary agent remain unconfirmed…
Hang on.
Who are these smart types in suits from Next and nice shiny shoes from Freeman Hardy Willis?
And why do they look entirely unfamiliar with the musical instruments they lovingly pluck at every night?
Surely it couldn't be BALLOON, Dedicated's answer to The Two Ronnies ?
Yes it could.
The hapless pair parked their hired van outside the LA offices of BMG, their US distributors, went upstairs for two minutes, came back down and found their gear, money, their original '60s clothing and instruments had been nicked.
Since they're only at the start of their two-month US tour, BMG sent them down to Next for some smart fashions.
On a similar subject, THAT PETROL EMOTION were held up in Derry (the place, not the EMF sex-god) last week.
Three youths armed with Armalite pen-knives waited for the band to unload their gear before threatening them and attempting to drive away with their van.
Fortunately for the Petrols, the van wouldn't start and the kids ran off, embarrassed.
Unfortunately for the Petrols, they were still stuck with the van and the gear…
More armed and extremely dangerous Irishmen in true tabloid style: THE FRAMES, Island Records' folk knees-up answer to ANDREW STRONG, were arrested at Dublin Airport last week for being in possession of high-velocity water guns.
Impounded by airline staff, the squirters were returned to the band when they arrived in London.
Shame they didn't just lock the band up and throw away the key…
A big Public NME -type congratulations to BEN of the SENSELESS THINGS who found an equally senseless thing to marry him on August 14.
Women around the world were heard to heave a huge sigh of relief.
The blushing (with reason) bride that drew the short straw was one Jo; formerly of a record store in Chicago, who sold Ben a rare MBV bootleg, causing him to drop immediately to one knee.
Stars in attendance included several members of SWERVEDRIVER and the remainder of the Senseless Thingys, ie no stars at all…
Another unlucky woman is Debbie Gillard, who got married last Saturday to RUSS HUNT, top crew geezer for the STUFFIES and brother of MILO O'HUNT.
In dutiful alcoholic attendance for Russ' stag night at the Camden Palace were the entire memberships of EMP, the Stuffies, PWEI and the FABULOUS.
The pop star's revenge, FEARGAL SHARKEY, formerly wobbly-voiced member of THE UNDERTONES who sought the kicks of teenagers, and wobbly-voiced failed solo star who advised listening to dad (wonder why his career went down the toilet), has swapped allegiances and is now A&R man at Polydor.
God knows, he couldn't be any worse at that than he was at his last job…
TRENT REZNOR, guv'nor of almost top electronic grungers NINE INCH NAILS, has moved into the house in LA where SHARON TATE, leading dead actress, was murdered by CHARLES MANSON.
Reznor was not aware of it, however, and was somewhat surprised to find nasty things going bump in the night.
Unlike everybody else, however, the hard man did not look up the neighbourhood exorcist in Thompson's Local Directory .
Instead he called his band and the whole lot are now cutting their next album round there with help from the ghost of La Tate.
If Nine Inch Nails' dreadful racket doesn't scare her off, nothing will.
At Smashed! last week, new sensitive rock types MOOSE and KINGMAKER were among the revellers.
LOZ was revelling more than most, and after the club closed he dragged sexy woolly hat-wearing NME hack SIMON WILLIAMS around the streets of Islington looking for a pot-bellied old man clutching a bottle of champagne as it was ‘the only way we'll get a drink at this time in the morning’.
Unfortunately, the only pot-bellied old man they ran into was clutching a plastic container of meths, and our heroes couldn't quite sink to such a Lollapalooza level of debauchery…
BLEACH FOR THE GUYS
YEAH, NIRVANA, I always liked them.
I knew all about them when they were called the Savage Sausages and they used to play the Powerhaus singing ‘Louie Louie’ through a 20 watt PA…
Now's your chance to impress your friends when they come over to your cardboard box.
Play them the Nirvana album they've never heard.
Yes, thanks to your incredibly generous friends at Public NME and our willingness to sleep with anyone for the sake of our readers, we've got 20 copies of ‘Bleach’, the classic debut set from Nirvana, to give away.
All you've got to do is answer one incredibly simple Nirvana-related question:
Rod Hull is famous for appearing with which feathered creature from Australia?
Send the answer on a postcard to: Don't forget to include your name and address, and state whether you'd prefer vinyl/cassette/CD, you picky gits.
Nirvana when they were Savage Sausages BC
BAT TRICK!
It could all have been so different, so glorious.
Whatever happened to LESLIE CARTER, selected alongside Clive Allen on the subs' bench at an England Schoolboys International against Wales at Wembley on March 20, 1976?
According to the programme,(see left) Leslie was ‘A regular member of the Blackheath District XI’, and ‘after taking his O levels he hopes to become a professional footballer’.
Les never made it, but he's no stranger to the wearing of shorts: the sub is better known as the FRUITBAT, third from the left in the front row of the pic.
Doubtless Fruitbat's future choice of career was influenced by the ‘Singalong with Ed ‘Stewpot’ Stewart’that opened the afternoon's entertainment.
Among the songs on offer were ‘Remember You're A Womble’, ‘Y Viva Espana’, ‘John Brown's Body’ and ‘Sheriff Fatman’.
CARTER, Leslie  Crown Woods School.
Regular member of the Blackheath District S.F.A.
XI and has also represented Inner London County S.F.A.
and London S.F.A.
An Associated Schoolboy with Crystal Palace F.C., he is actively interested in Athletics and after taking his ‘O’ levels he hopes to become a professional footballer.
