It's run on solid fuel, it's a cooker
Oh

Well I went not last Friday but the Friday before, they were doing it
Mm
they'd got it in right, cos she was showing my how it worked and that, all
control, but it's run on coke
Mm
anyway she says oh she says it's gonna be a feature here, it's a beauty, I mean I don't like old line, I don't, you know for the money what they costs,cooker 
Yeah, no, I think it's too much int it?
Yeah
Yeah
and, but she says like it, you know what I mean like 
What about her heating?
Has she got radiators?
Er that's run off her fire now, that's not run off it, that's just for a cooker that
I see
Yeah 
 
just for that?
Well no it for the, the heating's swapped over cos 
Oh 
they're gonna do
I was gonna say cos I think Jackie said hers was five hundred, but of course maybe it isn't 
But might of been might of been more because erm, tt she's had a, a grant for so much
Cos she only paid two thousand for house 
and she had a grant for so much off the council 
She did , oh is she?
Yeah
They're brick houses you know  that's why she had a grant?
Yeah
You see er she can have one because 
she had under a grant 
her, her fire won't burn coke, but ours will because ours is an Atlas
Mm
which will burn coke
Yeah
er well saying that 
 
burner
 
she says she says to me just take thirty pound, the, there were, I think there's about seven quid that belongs to their bed, well their bed was bloody horrible to pay
I wished that, is she still on?
I thought she paid up
She has, but it's in Annie's name
Oh I see
cos she's, she's got no
for Christmas
Oh what she spends every year
and anyway she rang David up and she said, she didn't say it were for Bet but she said she wanted another two hundred pounds
Mm
in vouchers, so he said yes, and then she tell me she said our dad will give me money, she said the, the to help out with that, she'll have about three holidays next year
Yeah and
and then, then he said to me 
she will won't she?
he'd been round last Friday, on Thursday she rang 
Mm 
up and she wanted five hundred pounds
Ooh God
for erm, what were it?
She says
hairdresser an er she'll, it would of cost so much to get car and she needed car doing, this, that and the other, and David refused her and when he went on Friday
Mm
key were in lock, but it were locked door
Mm
he said I know she'll in
Yeah 
cos bike were outside
Yeah
so
Yeah 
of course since Christmas she's not paid full money
No
and yet she's saying I'm gonna make this a feature, I'm having erm an archway over my Aga and erm, I mean she's got a new carpet you know
She's had hope that 
she er think should be eleven quid a week on carpet, she had an old carpet 
She paying eleven pound a week for that house in
yeah, she pays eleven, eleven pound a week then?
cos she wanted it on sixty weeks
Ooh  oh
 
cos she's had er patio doors put in her big room
Mm
it's not very nice shape
are they?
It seems ever 
Not very 
kitchen's every so queer though innit?
Well that well that's not a kitch well I don't, you know where she got her table?
Mm
That used to be the kitchen and then the wall, you know where that stove was 
Mm 
and they moved the sink from there into that side place, you know, made that like a kitchen, but it's, it's rightly weird house well now 
You know 
you know you go in front door and she had stairs knocked in, she's had all spindles done up the stairs 
Oh has she?
Yeah
She's had that done an'all?
Yeah, she's had all spindles put in
I mean that's not necessary is it?
No, but she had hers done cheap because er 
Oh has she?
I says to her that's what I want, you know I want mine doing like that
Mm
a bit, I mean I've got a hall, you know
Mm
whereas as you open front door
Yeah
anyway she says I've set my mind on it, and she said I kept going round and going round she says it was such a price
Mm
anyway their Bev's husband he'd been doing some work plus some money they dropped on these spindles, so she was telling me
Mm 
cheap and that
Mm
and then she got a joiner in to do it, but you know that 
He's a welder int he Bev's husband?
Well he's
to work
Is he?
Mm  and er 
Gone contract to somebody I think
she did, oh she was sending money and dad's been down there and the money ain't been paid into bank though 
She's a lovely girl Bev int she?
Yeah but she 
You can't you can't really get, be mad with her cos she's so nice, she never er, never nasty with you, is she?
No, it's 
Ever so nice it's just 
Yeah 
that she just gets a
I mean she 
she does 
she got electric bill two hundred and odd pounds
Oh God
she were crying and doing, you know what I mean?
Yeah
And er, but I mean you've got to watch your bills if you haven't got much money coming in Joyce ain't you?
Well you watch your bills if you have don't you really 
Yeah 
I mean you don't go mad at it do you?
I mean look at what's 
No 
costing us lately, we're having to get these, I mean we have that on two in the morning to get this room warmed up don't we have to put it down to one 
Yeah, Joyce has turned it down to one 
Yeah
and er, then it's costing er three bags of coal every week
Yeah
while this cold weather's on
Yeah
fourteen pound twenty five a week 
Yeah it's a lot of money
Yeah 
and then that every
I know
two or three weeks
it's a lot of money 
It's a lot of battle 
keep using much stuff we've got now, hmm you know we do well with that stuff too 
Well, just oh what we had stuff
yeah
I know Pauline was saying she's had to buy some coal
that's it
They do on the day fourteen bags for four ninety eight, cos I were in
Mm
and she's had to go and buy some that had gone, and I says well I, she says it's just burning it up that fire
Yeah
I said it's a great big grate
Yeah
I says well I actually put a couple of bricks at side
We've got a couple of bricks in ours
I says it'll throw same heat out
Yeah
and you'll not need all that
But we have a couple of bricks in
Couple of half bricks
Half bricks
Mm
so the fire can still get me warm
Yeah
get up, you'll still get your
Yeah
erm, there's holes or summat at side for er central heating
Oh, oh  cold
Mm
oh that's, that must be for burning coke then
What's that love?
Holes are yours, holes the same
Yes she's got holes the same she, burning
I agree
yet it'll be suitable for coke they said 
Yeah knowing she, she'll probably be put in for planning then  for coke
Oh, she's got central heating like, you know what I mean  erm she's not really into them now  I think
how she's got a cheek, she just gets what she wants don't she?
She just takes charge 
And then 
I've never heard anybody like her
No
and she gets away with it don't she?
cos he says er her husband is 
She's always  
she took it on six year, he says seven to eighty so she looks like working for next six year
then you know when I go she's pleading poverty, she'll say
Bet she'll go and buy it
Yeah 
Mm 
but er they've still had a, a lot of money put to it theirselves
I see
because you see  all this bloody expensive Aga, they won't be
towards that council, I mean like she's gonna have it tough again you know what I mean?
She always does, doesn't matter what she gets it's got to be different to anybody else's and 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
she'll get what she wants
and I thought oh fancy paying all that bloody money, I thought why it's only a cooker 
Mind you I like Annie I like Annie as well do you?
I don't I can't say I don't like her, but er 
Yeah she's, she's alright, she's alright, but she's 
you just feel like er, saying look Annie go steady, don't you, you know what I mean?
Well er I mean
Er I think well it, it's not on, she's got all this stuff and then she just thinks she can pay what she wants
Yeah
and it's, it's I mean shouldn't let her have that Joyce?
She could  shouldn't let her have all that
No, we could do that
Yes
couldn't we?
Of course we could yeah anybody could 
Anybody could go and get all this stuff and then not pay 
Not pay for it yeah that's right
er, I mean it's irresponsible
Yeah
and she'll say our Bev's, our Bev's been, you know, and the money ain't run in or his pit pension ain't gone in
you know and then
Mm
she's here telling me how they sent over and she said oh don't call for the next two week because we're going to Italy
and, like I say I mean 
She will do 
Yeah

Yeah we haven't we haven't got much to go away and 
Yeah

What is a senior citizen?
Two fifty or three pound
A senior citizen is one who was here before the pill, before television, frozen food, credit card and ballpoint pens, for us timesharing meant togetherness, not computers and a chip meant a piece of wood, hardware meant hardware and software wasn't even a word, teenagers never wore slacks, we were before pantyhose, drip-dry clothes, dishwashers, clothes driers and electric blankets, we got married first and then lived together
How quaint can one be?
They all wore Peter Pan collars and thought cleavage was something butchers did, we were before vitamin, vitamin pills, disposal diapers, Q E one, jeeps, pizzas, instant coffee and Kentucky Fried wasn't even thought of, in our day cigarette smoking was fashionable, grass was for mowing, pot was something you cooked in.
A gay par person was the life of the party and nothing more
while
meant beauty lotions or help for someone in trouble, we are today senior citizens, a hardy bunch when you think of how the world has changed and of the adjustments we have had to make and that is  
 
That was good that was weren't it?
And don't forget any of you who would like to go to Goldthorpe I'm taking the names
