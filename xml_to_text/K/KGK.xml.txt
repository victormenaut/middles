Right I put this together ah very quickly just before you came in, I thought it would be useful to get some feedback on the education the two educational events that have taken place so far, now unfortunately I couldn't go to Topping Printing but you were there Ann
Were you there as an 
I wasn't, I wasn't there I'm afraid
I thought you were, right none of us were there, the feedback that I got was that
this was the at 
that it was extremely good but in actual fact it went on until twenty to nine at night
goodness me
but fifty per cent of the people who said they were coming didn't turn up and most of them didn't phone in or anything like that which was a little bit of an upset for the host erm and consequently there was a bit put in
that's right because he discussed it with me
yes
erum was he upset?
A little bit I think that he was just concerned that perhaps there might've been other people who might've wanted to come and if people had rung up and you had had a waiting list something could've been done about it
There was no waiting list er
but I think the other thing is that  it's just a question of the people in our business supposed to be being professional communicators
yes
and you're not commissioned communicating professionally or particularly politely if you don't ring up that day or the next day anybody understands if you have a puncture a road accident a client crashes but there's nothing to actually stop you ringing up the next day and saying so sorry you couldn't make it
that's right 
and there'd a much worse instance similarly with the I P R at  when forty two people had signed up for something and only five appeared
ah ha
and I think my concern is that I P R and B A I E might being to get a bad name with hosts if that got known 
mhm 
yes that's a bit embarrassing
well talking headlines we have fifteen people wanted to come.
In the event eight did, but, everybody who couldn't come phoned up or got somebody to phone 
right 
up on their behalf so the message got through it would have been nice if we'd got ten at Talking Headlines this room takes ten comfortably um but Jack had done his homework he did a super presentation had everybody rolling around in 
aha 
laughter so that by the time we came to do the five practical ev exercises you know everybody was in a very relaxed and jolly mood but I think that's was it's about but from the results that we were getting from the practical exercises clearly what he said had taken root you know roll key words, roll them around in your mind er try running through letters of the alphabet to match up with your key word chains and you know if if if the word is ball try roll see if you can get it to rhyme and ultimately the creme de la creme is if you can actually get the title of a song or
yes
a well-known phrase or the name of a television game and then, so that had obviously 
his his delivery I found very solid, I mean I didn't find it particularly humorous but I mean people weren't laughing that much were they?
I mean smiling smiling
standing up at this end was a lot were you here when he went through all the old headlines of er 
yes yes , yes I was surprised people I suppose most people have seen those before actually
oh I mean these are classics 
classics 
Oh I mean many of them were taken out of a book which had in the front price five and sixpence so a so I think that went very well and er I mean Jack was much encouraged by it so much so that he's going to actually offer to do it for another organisation that he's connected with
aha
he was was so pleased with the way the way it worked out he had never every done anything like that before
oh right that's nice.
Is he retired now?
he's retired now, yeah and sometimes well he used to go in and help Carl out at the Scottish Office when you were away producing your sprogs he edited
he did the issues he did very well
yeah
better headlines than we did
he sometimes comes in and helps me out as well so very first class chap if you know anybody that needs a good  headline writer Jack's your man
yep
Upcoming events.
Talking audio visual that's an event that is taking place with S S K in Glasgow on the second of February I'm disappointed by the number of people who have said that they want to go largely because we've gone out of our way to do something in Glasgow
It's always the same
and the Glasgow people aren't biting
yeah how many people have you got?
I can probably tell you I have phoned 
  
and said could you please put the word around your people um well there's yourself Ann Packard erm
What time is it George?
It's six o'clock at S S K  so that's  erm
Mind you I've had an S S K presentation before so
is three  of Mercer's is four  I would probably go through would be five  would go through that would be six
I'm going to try to get to that one George I'll let you know 
Aye, if we could get ten it would be nice
it would be nice
but I mean they were sort of saying anything over twenty four and were toiling a bit.
One of the interesting things about S S K is that they clearly see us as an organisation they want to court.
They put up a prize at the awards ceremony they're prepared to do all the art work for nothing or at cost price for the awards ceremony they laid on this evening for us now if three people turn up at their evening they gonna say as we putting our money in the right organisation
yeah that's right
so it's more than just an education visit here it's actually  
its a real P R visit isn't it 
is it worth actually circulating any of the P R firms in Glasgow like   
what's happening is that the membership handbook should have been out last week but I think it's actually going out physically today and I've done a reminder which'll be mailed out with it erm making one or two little pointed remarks about blah blah blah this is a very important event and please note it is not in Edinburgh you know erm S S K are very supportive of us we should you know take advantage of this very important  
but were they really hoping for twenty four people?
They didn't know what they were hoping for quite honestly
yes yes
but I said that you know eighteen might be a push but I wouldn't be surprised if we got twelve or fourteen at that time of course we hadn't actually had any education events cos the one that we scheduled has been cancelled so I was perhaps a bit naive about how many people actually turn out to these things
Yeah Glasgow you would really be pushed to get though mind you the attendance at the Black Museum was quite good
ah ha, was that an I P R thing?
No no that was ours
right, okay so anyway that erm one's causing a little bit of concern, I've got another one scheduled for March which I was going to centre on here where  will come along and talk to us about the Editor and the Royal Visit and you know ee ach dear me how glad I am to be away from the Scottish Office
ha ha
everybody's like a giggly virgin on their first date when you phone them up and ha ha ha I'll need to get permission  and have you spoken to and you know and we may need to talk and all I want you to do is come along for 
I know 
our mutual it helps them if we know how it works it helps us if we know what problems they encounter
yeah he's talked to me actually as well about dealing with people who from the inside have dealt working with him doing royal visits because obviously that's quite useful a lesson for them to get over to people
I mean we could probably both do a royal visit ourselves, I've done several 
 
and I mean I have done several since I left the Scottish Office as well which is quite good and I thought that I might put Sandy at his ease by telling a couple of amusing incidents that have happened post the Scottish Office days
yes
er where I was asked by  remember 
yes oh
who was the Navy P R O.
He wandered into my office  is a chubby Falstaffian figure who smokes a curved pipe
whilst you're twiggy like me
mm


gotta gotta royal visit coming up he said you've worked at the Scottish Office do you know anything about them and I said yes tell the Scottish Office they'll do all the  a Royal navy one I've got to do it  I said fine when is it?
Tomorrow ah have you had a dress rehearsal?
There's one happening today  in ten minutes I've got a car waiting outside
so I said right I'll come down and give you a you a hand with it and it was the re-dedication or re-commissioning of a ship
right
a very small ship, a frigate, and er the captain was at most Lieutenant Commander and the Princess Royal was doing the re-dedication and because it was the winter it was being done inside a big shed, that's the background.
We got there and the Lieutenant Commander Captain who looked about thirty two or thirty three ah was about six foot two with a great shock of blond hair and of course I immediately nicknamed him Admiral  because he looked Germanic
yes,
and a he had the same unyielding attitude to life that Germans would have and a very bad temper.
So we got there and he said right okay you're the press chappy he's right I've put your press people over there so while  respect Lieutenant Commander that really won't do because everything including the Band of the Royal Marines is between them and the Princess Royal so we argued about this and the compromise eventually was that that everybody would have to stay there until the ceremony started and then we could bring the stills photographers round to the end and up to one side where it was all happening mainly to get a picture of his wife cutting the cake.
This is a tradition in the Royal Navy when a ship's being re-commissioned the youngest rate and the Captain's wife cut a ceremonial cake cake using the Captain's sword
right
right the royal personage stands to one side and smiles so you know we could could come in for this.
So I told the press the next morning who were mega grumpy at all of this and I don't blame them, so when the ceremony started Pat took the stills photographer round to the front and the television guys as the Princess began to inspect er the crew pulled all their gear through the Band of the Royal Marines over their toe caps under the tubas and pressed their cameras under the nose of the Princess Royal which wouldn't have happened had the Lieutenant Commander been prepared to listen to us and of course you could see him getting angrier and angrier 
oh dear 
then when his great moment came and his wife came to cut the cake all the photographers suddenly decided they needed to clean the lenses of their camera and his wife's picture was never taken .
 
So the message I think got through 
 
so that I thought was a nice tale 
yes , good one yes
I'll tell you a lovely story when we had the Queen at  the day before when we had had the dress rehearsal I'd been out to erm London  to pick erm up an old lady who's now dead, who very seldom got out and was pretty well house-bound to come and see the rehearsal as a little Sunday treat
yes
On the way down on that stretch of road from death one to death two I call them, the  roundabouts I suddenly realised if we were going to have a rehearsal we needed to have a bouquet of flowers didn't we so I leapt out of the car picked some weeds tied them up with a piece of strong so that the chap of our staff who was going to be in front of me was going to hold them during the rehearsal whilst I dashed up to play first of all the Lord Provost and then the Queen or the Lady Provost as she then was.
Anyway the next day Brocklesby is berthing and I can see the captain pointing at me, my hem was showing my petticoat was showing my hat off and afterwards I said to him erm what was so funny oh he said I was telling the Queen about you having those weeds for the rehearsal yesterday and she thought it was terribly funny


so it took me a long time to live down my weeds the lady with the weeds 
that's right
Brocklebury's a minesweeper
minesweeper yeah
but mind you we had much worse a problem that day because we had two sets of sniffer dogs who didn't like something  and the first lot that were in and didn't like something that we'd 


and though they went away and the bomb squad came they went away they they had a problem with their vehicles and the second lot of dogs didn't like the area either
Oh right
in the meantime Brocklesby was approaching and this one horrendous photograph of me looking very harassed  you can well imagine and my father ever pompous when he saw this photograph said huh where were your directors, wasn't one of them in charge, and I said no they were away having lunch, they were just going to arrive when they you know, anyway?
It's all good fun royal visits I mean the last 
that's right 
one I did was with Caledonian Paper at Irvine and the Finns or the Swedes whoever own
Finns they are
were absolutely paranoid


we rehearsed it and we rehearsed it and  I mean I didn't mind they were paying the bill for  and I literally with a college took up residence for several days before it in a local hotel and we went through it in every fine detail
yes
and we knew exactly what photographs were going to be taken who was shaking who's hand and you know.
Right come the morning  arrived and  and somebody else I can't remember who though, and there we were all ready to go and were walking with the press into the massive great shed where they roll the paper and make it a massive place the size of a couple of football pitches, we were just going in the door and somebody said to me they're no gonna be using their flash guns are they?
I said yes why, they cannae do that mister he said it'll affect all the sensors on the machines oh ah


the whole place was gonna come to a halt if anybody fired a flash gun and furiously Fred grabbed the royal people and I grabbed the Finns and we started reorganising the present so they could take place under the enormous great windows that there are in  and nobody had said at any time a flash gun will stop the machines.
These are the sort of things that are
oh no
where's that going to be?
Well do here I think
and when?
It's March sometime erm
do you have a rough date?
aye
you've got a firm date haven't you?
let's find it, you see the trouble with efficiency is that I find er so much paper 
if you give me my basket I think you'll find it in there actually 
The fifteenth rings a bell 
fifteenth of Feb 
er no fifteenth of March 
no March 
rings a bell er because I  a circular out about it
right
fifteenth of March in here
ya I thought that that sounded right okay 
right what day of the week is the fifteenth?
It's a
Tuesday
a Tuesday yeah okay good right
I wonder if that  I'm now being serious is this room big enough if a lot of people want to come?
A lot of people won't come, I mean I erm erm fairly confident now that if it's B A I E only we even out at about eight, I mean twenty can put their names down eight will turn up
yes
yes, I suppose actually really you see it's like the network evenings that there used to be in that ghastly little pub at the West End
ah ha, maybe we should get a licence for this
definitely
all I'm allowed to retail in here is Morrisons  whisky
well that's right,


you can provide the whisky and we'll hire the glasses


that's the way round the licensing regulations
erm, right
what time will it be?
aye is it not in there?
no, only
then Sandy hasn't given me a time but I think I'd suggested to him between six and seven I think people like that they don't have to go home and 
but talking estimating the next one is that the one that we'd originally called Talking Print Buying that I'd got  
yes so let's dwell on that because you've got some information Carolyn, you've got some information Ann
yes, well I mean about two lots of minutes ago
ah ha
I put in a square bracket on the minutes
right
in October I think it was 
yes you're right
which I couldn't find today  did I not in the actual end approved version does it not say that I've got the tape and people fixed 
it's blue paper that it came off the fax machine I'm sure er 
no, no, no this is the minute which was posted to you before I went to the States
right, then it won't be on blue paper if it was posted but you did put down that two  
that's right 
indicated that they're willing to come along
right and you've got 
I've got the  by Manager for H M S O willing
tremendous
to take part which should be quite interesting I haven't really discussed it in detail with him because I wasn't sure who else was taking part and what sort of format we're thinking of having 
right , let's kick that about then Scottish Homes have offered us their facilities, they would act as host
and would you think that was six o'clock again or would you like to make
six o'clock seems to be a nice time, Scottish Homes said they would lay on coffee and
and what number of people can they take?
Again, er they were talking at the higher reach of our number
twenty wasn't it?
Aye
They said something like that, they seemed fairly relaxed erm now what numbering is is this one that there would be any value opening up to others for the whole thing
I think that if you've only got twenty spaces then that's difficult because we've got a hundred and something members most of whom are in the central belt
but only eight of whom will come
when you mean others who else do you mean?
well I was thinking not so much  the Edinburgh  Communications Group 
but that's now got forty six members some of whom are mutual
yeah
but that means you've got potentially mm a hundred and thirty people perhaps
of whom
why don't you wait and see what the numbers are like and then you can always ring up a few people and say we've got a space if you'd like to come
right,okay, when should we try and go for that maybe at the end of April beginning of May?
End of April's fine I think
right, erm 
what  we're gonna have three people taking part are we, three sort of speakers or?
Well , do we need three speakers? erm
We've got somebody from  haven't we the printer
yes we have
so we've got one or two  people because they thought they'd do a duo on design and print buying from them
How long


I mean could they do that in about quarter of an hour
Why don't you say to them that they each organisation I mean H M S O  and  have ten minutes each for a presentation
yes
ah ha
and then the rest is questions and answers
yes
we could happily give them fifteen minutes that would take up forty five minutes
yes, and then
H M S O
print buyer
print buyer
and  design and print buying   then you have a slight break in the attention span if each person's fifteen minutes
ah ha, yes
and then question and answers 
yes , that seems reasonable  what's the kind of remit of their presentation going to be are they going to look at problems which arise or
I think what what we want to know is er the estimator at .
Now we all know because we're print buyers to a larger or greater degree but they're clients they over-estimate they add about twenty five per cent more on than they need and you have to send them back to sharpen their pencils several times before you've seen the estimate, they of course know that all print buyers are idiots who keep forgetting all the important things and don't give them half the information they need like the weight of paper or the fact that there's to be a pocket at the back so, I think if we got the man  I think if we maybe started off with H M S O the print buyer which is more akin to what we are and say well you know these are the problems I've got I'm sitting with a six million pound budget buying for the whole of the government of Scotland and I have problems and these are the problems that I have, then we get to the wee man from  who says now wait a minute boys I get the rubbish that you send out, that was the message and let's make it funny but slightly aggressive let's highlight the real problems because that's what it's about, we're not here for a nice night we're here to learn
yes, right
and then finally we could finish off with Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men or whatever they want to call themselves from  and they could say well we're the guys in between we've got clients out there but we have to deal with printers and estimators and this is what life is like for us.
I don't know if I'm unique, I suspect I'm not but I go to my two design people and I say right blah blah blah this is what we want to do but you organise the printer I want you as the designer to find a printer that you can work with but here's my timescale and it's up to them
erm, yes and some of the design houses will mark up what then handle some of them won't in terms of after the design stage and that I think is something that some people don't always realise
ah ha
yes
but some parts of the job if you do it yourself you're gonna save some money
mhm
whereas certain parts of their handling are going to be about fifteen twenty per cent 
yes
okay, right let's define this task up a little bit
then, right
I will unless anybody else wants to do it I'll write to Len and say this is what we want the estimator to do
yes, I'll contact  
could you firm it up a little bit with him you firm it up with  I'll talk to Scottish Homes
yes
and tell them what's the nice girlie at Scottish Homes


she's married to an Advocate isn't she?
Is she?
Think so 
right
she doesn't spell her name like that  and I'll speak to  within the next couple of working days 
can we have a date end of April
fix up a date, end of April or the beginning of May and
do you want a little bit of  done about each person
it would be helpful but I'll  introduction  
H M S O have x million clients blah blah blah blah 
yeah, yeah
so that gives them a little bit of introduction for each one
so that we know and also it puts the guy in context for I mean these if I remember I mean H M S O are mega bucks buyers
and even bigger now
aye, aye
they have this sort of automatic estimating system with key information just goes shooting out to the  amazing so, yeah a wee bit about each one would be helpful
ah ha a little potted bit
and then a discussion afterwards
ah ha, erm yeah, well I mean okay if we say take fifteen minutes each and we start five or six minutes late each one will overrun by three  
so they will have finished their speaking by seven and
by seven and then it's up to the members  
yes is the proposal for the is it coffee and sandwiches beforehand or at the end?
I'll ask  
do you happen to know 
but um I'm a great believer that it's rather nice to have that going on while the event is going on you know you sit and munch a corned beef butty as you dribble your coffee down the front of your shirt 
 
you can tell  
 
right, okay,
okay, how're we doin how we doin 
good
right, so
I was going to speak in terms of numbers George it was just a wee thought that if there's going to be three or four of them we want at least eight of us if not it's gonna be a bit 
that's right
that's right
unbalanced
I'm very happy if I could see fifteen or sixteen coming to this 
me too fifteen or six I think we need to think about you know the timing
absolute 
got fifteen
again, I mean I maybe shouldn't do this but I tend to take a very relaxed attitude to these things and if somebody wants to bring a pal or if somebody that would be interested I see it as P R for the B A I E you know 
Yes , I mean my view is that we put it out for members we see what the uptake is and then we can always look at the list and ring certain other people
You might get some of Sandy's might want to come along, Sandy's people 
Sure , great, ah ha
or if we're stuck get our heads together and drag in a few extra bodies
that would be great but it would be nice to get about sixteen people 
Yes , I think so if it were just three or four of them you've got to have 
well that would make your twenty wouldn't it because if you have four speakers and you're aiming for sixteen punters 
twenty people 
I mean let's be honest if we all turned out that's five and if the rest of the Executive Committee turned out that would virtually take it up to ten we wouldn't be looking for many more after that
well the Committee is fourteen people anyway  isn't it or ten people
aye but I mean some of them are on this Committee as well I mean Wendy and I for a start erm  so that would be good right let's try and give that one a  
right , okay
let's now say that a joint event with the I P R and the E I C G I'm having a lot of difficulty making contact with the I P R
Why?
And I don't what I get 
I never have 
for my my hundred and ninety pounds a year
do you mean with the I P R in London
No with the I P R in Scotland
well what's the problem?
Right, the problem is that I can't seem to get through on the telephone, I phoned  and her secretary came back and said you've to phone and she gave me a guy's name like  and I got a number for him so I phoned it, ah he works in our Edinburgh office I phoned the Edinburgh office.
I'm sorry he's not in today I said that's okay I'll call tomorrow.
I don't like leaving messages
yes
on B A I E things cos I don't know how other people's offices react
so I phoned him back the next day, ah he's in our Glasgow office today so I phoned the Glasgow, he's on the phone, I said that's okay I'll call back.
So I called back again and the number was engaged, so I called back again and got through and he'd left for the day
Ah ha, I tell you
I phoned the Edinburgh office again the nex and I thought I'm giving this up I'm gonna write
George funnily enough the time that we did a course with I P R before
mhm
we actually ended up with a lot more I P R people and we'd done all the work and they got most of the money now that's fine that's the way life goes sometimes, but I must admit I think that depending on how big an event you want to make it you're maybe as well to keep it an B A I E event and open it up quietly at the end
yep
I mean what about the E I C G, again this seems one that I thought might interest them?
Who are by and large Edinburgh based as well 
Yes, I mean I don't think there's a problem about opening it up to them except their meetings traditionally are in the early morning
ah ha
erm
Anyway I've spoken to  and  is tied up until February which is fine because
right
basically so am I, I've got to write a  news in the next few days so I'll see  in early February tell him about the ideas, I've also been in touch with another lobbying firm, I say been in touch but it's quite easy because
not the Westminster whatever they're called
No um Michael Fraser Associates have now started a lobbying operation which is run for them by the former Chief Executive of the Tory Party in Scotland whose name I've forgotten but he lives down at Tiningham in East Lothian ah, now if I could get him in if Fred doesn't object and again if Fred didn't object and the other guy didn't object it might be worth getting a member of Parliament in 
That would I mean that would determine which day of the week you'd try and do it probably wouldn't it?
erm well I mean there are some MPs any day of the week will do you know there anybody's for a good meal but erm
I mean ah I know I know  but then he's pretty tied up and I know  very well but even trying to get lunch with  is difficult but there may be there may be I mean  I know  quite well but would want .
He is  
What about somebody like  
I was gonna say he'd be very good
yep yep
No I find him quite helpful
aha
when I've taken things to him I must admit
right well that's a possibility I mean
So when are you thinking about that in the summer 
Well I don't know it would probably have to be May or June I think erm 
May or June right 
if we if we get it off the ground at all it may be we'd want to carry it over till the Autumn and start the new season with it.
So that's really just to let you know
right
what's going on at the moment and where I am with it
I'll quickly rattle through the next one effectively nothing more has happened at Napier, they went off for their Christmas holidays about the fourth of November and came back about the nineteenth of January er, not quite as bad as that but nearly as I mean they've even longer holidays than we've got and we get a fortnight at Christmas and New Year
I think you meant the fourth of December and not fourth of November
Well November, I meant the fourth of November it seems to be for ever anyway I spoke to  the Head of the Department when they came back and he said I must admit we've done nothing from the point of view of putting things on paper but a lot of thinking has gone into it I must really sit down now and commit things to paper.
But he reckoned we would be on course for a start in April for the er certificate er which would be twelve  half day day release courses
I was interested in the thing in B A I E news which you had been talking about getting grants for people to do it
Yes, that was a bit that's been a bit hyped up erm 
that intrigued me because it didn't seem to me that it was to be eligible
well the the  have a training roll and it may well be that the  will be able to I mean I haven't spoken  for example but they have taken over the functions of the old Manpower Services Commission training agency.
Also organisations like ours are members of the Construction Industry Training Board so for instance if  was going along we might get a  from the C I T B so I mean grants might be available if people rout around for them.
So that basically is it how would we see the course's structure I don't think we've got time to do that today I wanted really to just to throw some ideas with you good folks and get the benefit of your thoughts and experience so that I could go back to Napier and say this is what my committee says 
Yes, I haven't brought the modular things I mentioned to you on the phone the other day but I think it would be very useful to sit down and look at structuring that
yeah
which is what I've done for something else and what we simply did was to take an A 4 landscape sheet erm and carve a syllabus over I think that was sixteen or eighteen weeks or something up, and divide it into you know units of competence, elements of competence and the assignments and the homework
to my mind probably the most hardest part of teaching somebody something at Napier will be actually how to write ah, everything else is a mechanical function that they can learn layout, scaling photographs like that.
How do how do you teach somebody to  
well there's an interesting chap who lives in South Queensferry who does writing courses for the public library
ah ha
and my Japanese  when I was in the States found the leaflet and when I cam back she said wouldn't this be of interest to you for my own  and then she said and what about your project because there will be people there who write and dead dead true.
You know I've got quite a lot of material from the corpus from it.
Nice chap and he teaches creative writing in  Glasgow, used to be a teacher then a teacher trainer and then I think took early retirement and he does this but made the point that he simply uses it for extra income for pleasure and interest as opposed I suppose to a way of writing you know so
But he's never been a journalist
No, but again in terms of creative writing and feature writing, that's maybe you could get two people to do a duo, one from the journalist side and one from more general side
okay I think what we might think about doing is maybe just having a meeting for an hour one evening on that one subject 
yes brainstorming , I think so
I mean Wendy's ill and Gordon's got stuck in Manchester
right
both of whom phoned in this afternoon.
I think it would be nice if we all got together so will we aim to do that sometime in the next month or so and I'll tell Napier that that we're doing that
let's do that
Would you like to see a sample page of this other thing
aye, why not, why not the final thing was
Is it going to be based really on what's in the
Editor's Handbook 
Editor's Handbook in part 
yeah, that's the core but it needs fleshing out more and a  has agreed that you know it's if you just stuck to the Editor's Handbook it's too narrow and it does need, I mean B A I E in London thus far are being extremely helpful if slightly cautious and I've to go down and talk to the revamped education committee when the revamped education committee gets around to having a meeting
Well it's due to have one very soon
I mean there are all sorts of little peculiarities for example you do not have to be a member of B A I E at any level to sit B A I E exams.
That's daft
I thought you did because to do 
exactly 
I know, hang on I'm not sure whether that's right 
well I have it I have it from the words of  himself er
because I thought you had to be in post this is what we had a problem with with Napier's request for recognition
You can take a B A I E examination without being a member of the association at any level because I've said that what we should do is we should insist because Napier want to bring a lot of students in on this
mm
and they want to make it an elected module for people doing other things
Ah yes, but now that's very interesting because that's not the same as was the old regulation with the H N D recognition with Napier, and it used to be as I understood it that you had to actually be in membership and leave a period of time between doing the certificate and the diploma.
Anyway, there we are, erm so I mean there are things like that also er we need to work out how we divvy up the exam fee, I mean I've said to B A I E but they haven't so far  
the exam fee 
yeah, they haven't so far  
what do you mean by the exam fee?
the forty pound fee to sit the exam
ah you mean divvy it up with who?
With Napier, B A I E charge  
but Napier are going to be teaching the course Napier 
sure 
aren't going to be conducting the examination
Ah well you see that's what I'm talking about as well, Napier are saying if your guys want to set the exams fine but we did in fact in the last exam paper find a fundamental flaw.
There was a question that could not be answered by students outside London because
who sat that 
a London colloquialism has been used, Napier were saying that we're doing the tutoring we would be happy to set the exam paper but with say  
but the exam paper was common for the United Kingdom
sure, well er
so you're saying you want to make a different exam paper for Scotland
no, what I'm saying is I think that's something that the B A I E education committee nationally should sit down and have a look at, I mean it may well be that at the end of the day Napier would set a better exam paper than they would er, also I've suggested to them and again they haven't  that Napier validate the course do the marking but with perhaps two B A I E fellows
yes
as part of the team
yes, that's right
and if we divvied up the exam fee on a fifty per cent basis it would mean that B A I E were getting twenty quid for doing nothing but probably more twenty quids than they would get normally because students who would be attracted in through Napier would be paying their forty quid as well
mm
right
so all of these things are put so finally
Can I just go back  
 
you've got children to collect
 
what I don't understand though is if Napier students get a certificate or a diploma are they going to be able to call themselves D I P M A I E without being a member of the organisation.
That seems to me a complete and utter nonsense
that's right 
well if yes if you can sit the exam already without being a B A I E member presumably you can do that already   it seems daft  Carol please  
George I'm not being  but is he sure he's right
yes
do you want to set a date for another meeting just now or do you want to get in touch later George?
I think it'd be better  it's just than I'm under a wee bit of pressure at the moment to be in thirty five different locations  
okay give me a shout then
I will do, I will do I mean it's actually easier  
Carol give me your number


and your address




I've got a phone and a fax
How's  by the way?
slim,I'm still involved with the prison service thing but I need something else
ah ha
bits and pieces but I need something else of the same size, you know
right, right
so I'm looking for one other thing which is not too big and not too small
How
does the prison service come out?
Quarterly
is looking for a job if you need an assistant
I'm sure he is  
i was talking to him yesterday
he's con how's his convalescence going?
I haven't heard David sounding so lively
yes
and chirpy for many many years 
yes much more relaxed
but did somebody else say to me that he's taking action against the Scottish Office
yes
according to a daily letter he and 
a quarter of a million, I'm not sure of the figures
post traumatic stress, I have my own views about what will happen there
yeah.
the lawyer, the Admiralty lawyer seems to think they've got a good case
who's doing it?
the fellow who did the  
 
ah the people who do the the 
 
what erm what was the name of the disaster
Piper Alpha
that's the one so they seem to think we've got a good case so
when I mean
the interesting thing about that is why didn't somebody of his maturity and experience ask for it
well, that's a good point you see somebody who has slogged their way for a decade through messy complicated family litigation or have even represented myself in court in front of a judge in the court of session and one, and I'm very proud of this I did this last May um I know how tough the going is
yes, yes
er, when you know you go home and lying on the doormat on the Friday night is a great tome of paper that came second post which made me out to be the biggest idiot philanderer, thief, cheat and liar in the world
of course 
and after a time you know you say ha and you just  because the lawyer for the other side always goes for the very worst scenario
yes, yes
and I can't see the two people involved being able to stomach that very easily because questions like why did you not ask for counselling at the time or you were in charge  and  why did you not ensure he had any adequate 
yes
I could see this getting very nasty very quickly
I think I'd probably settle out of court 
aye
aye
very happy
aye
shut them up
aye
quarterly  
 
right
it's just about to come out in three weeks time
oh really because it would have been nice if you could have put something in the corpus about the prisoners who help with the corpus actually
or a bit in the B A I E Communicators Newsletter in Scotland you know here's a member that's launched a new publication for the Scottish prison service
yes we could do
but it won't be read by the cons it'll be read by the screws
that's right
who are in some cases worse than we thought


Carol thanks very much for coming in okay
thanks a lot be in touch give me a buzz, any time okay bye
goodbye  home right the structure of the course
aye, let's have a separate meeting on that I mean I've largely left it up to and  and one or two others that I've met up there
who else have you met up there because I was so surprised  
hellish on names I can't remember
because I'm so surprised that  and  said they didn't know anything about it
there were four people at the last meeting er   and two others from the department a male and a female who looked after the bits of the department but I cannot now remember what their names were let me just see if I've got my notes which were written on the inside of a British Airways flight ticket   come in, hi ya
hello
you're being recorded
the ill one enters the room
what's her name again?
Bella
just one message for you
oh 
aye, he's off now
I'll call him tomorrow
finished transcribing those notes
but you must be fairly near the end
aye hope so
aye
they seem to be going on and on and on
right okay
I'll do that first thing tomorrow morning
bless you
come in which will be about what lunchtime
I would reckon I'll be finished with Norman about ten o'clock it takes me an hour and a half to drive down half past eleven say I'm in here about twelve o'clock right, cheers
okay thanks a lot goodbye
we have I mean this company
you've got N V Q stuff there, which is that?
this company moves at such a rapid rate of knots that I have a meeting tomorrow morning with the Managing Director Building and Property Development at his house in Pitlochrie which is the only time he's literally coming back to change his shirt before he goes wandering round the world again so the only way I can get him is to go up and stay with the in-laws over night and see him at breakfast time tomorrow.
I haven't in fact got  
right don't worry 
so, erm I mean think we're in their hands and that's why I was a bit apprehensive about doing publicity for it at such an early stage because I like to see i's dotted and t's crossed er but however I'll chase them up again in the next few days
but are the point about how it's structured is if for example it's going to be open to students at Napier
Napier
what about the students in the Communications Department at Queen Margaret College?
if they wanted to come along to it they could
But why don't you allow them to run a similar course there because it would mean more student members
two things
and more students doing the exam
right, two things first of all I mean I think this is the first one and once Napier get it up and running I think it's exportable
yes but I think when you look at how it's structured and whether it's modular structure and its content it's got to be written that it will be United Kingdom exportable not merely
sure I mean yes Napier have
Well I think it's been open to any higher education institution to grab this idea because it's been around for a long time, the great beauty of Napier is to some degree it's a centre of excellence it's got its B A course so has Queen Margaret but at the bottom end but why should I say the bottom end at the bottom end it's got the B A communications course at the top end it's got apprentice training for printers.
So everything's there, printing presses repro separation houses, sheet film, computer set up and Apple Macs and everything is there, it's actually a very impressive set up erm, the Queen Margaret's course, I'm slightly dubious about I once had a colleague I'm going back a decade who had been employed on the basis of doing the communications course at Queen Margaret I think, and it turned out that it wasn't communications as we understood it, it wasn't our sort of communications P R newspapers and things like that, it was communications on a much broader, broader front so  it didn't actually fit in to the world of P R and what happened was I then had to sit down and train this woman from scratch and get rid of a lot of the preconceived notions that she had come in with she had brought from Queen Margaret's College.
I mean I've had Fife College on the phone as well saying you know why can't we do it and Alec  we're really now we can do no more until Napier come up if for some reason Napier fell down on the job then I think I've got enough knowledge about what we're doing now but I would start running it round the other colleges including Telford who are doing a distance learning course
Oh yes but they've been doing distance learning course they've got the biggest distance learning course in Europe
Yeah but they're doing the distance learning course at the moment on publicity and P R I think erm I had some papers about that somewhere 
well this is the open learning opportunities here they've got erm various things including the  communications and so on 
right they're doing an H N C in communications for business and there are modules in that that would actually suit some of our
who have you met down there
I haven't met anybody they mail shot us um I thought I'd brought it with me
cos I've met I've met with them before
aha
on some of their things and in fact two of their people came to the intellectual property thing 
right
so I think in a way it would be quite nice to sit down with somebody from each of the colleges to hammer out the syllabus because Napier will see it from Napier's point of view about what's easiest for them to teach and what this and what the other whereas I suspect if you also sat down with   and  and people you might get a broader discussion base
I have a built in um caution of those who wander in the groves of academe I always feel they're a bit divorced from the real world
I don't think you would I certainly don't think you would find  divorced from the real world because he's involved in consultancy work and research work with the national companies out with the organisation
I'd like to see what hard nosed er B A I E people would make of it you know people who are making a living from doing the same well you know when I employ somebody coming into the business this is what I want them to be able to do um this has always been of course an  a criticism
yes could we sit down and write the two of us some pages to put to this next meeting so that we have actually got some meat in front of us?
Well we could try and do that my I've got a workload that would choke a camel at the moment because I'm also the admin officer at the moment for the Public Relations flight of the R A F E R.
Because of a lecture I gave last weekend I've to write a paper on how P R audits can be applied to the military which is great fun and an acknowledgement that people of a senior level were listening to my lecture but, um it's put quite a bit of work on me.
But by all means if you've got something bring it along and that would give us a starter for five  I'm keen to see us also trying to once we've got this going going down the S P Q road ah  had lunch with  the other day at  I mean it was I mean she wasn't meeting him necessarily wearing a B A I E hat  of  not  um and I think she I think she touched on that though while while while they were lunching. erm I put down  progress because I was thinking of the Pilgrims Progress at the time
erm  Yes it's quite interesting I mean the if you go and look at the computerised facility that I'd found about communications training, there are something like three hundred and ninety two sources of training in Scotland.
Those obviously include all the further education colleges that do the basic um  and the basic  things and then the H N C H N D it gives you the open learning things which includes then the private sector people  communicate and all sorts of other agencies, erm it depends really what you see as a beginner, do you mean a beginner in the communications field in its entirety, or do you mean a beginner as an in-house industrial editor or a freelancer by definition a beginner is not likely to be a freelancer?
Aha That's right, it would be somebody of  one rung down perhaps from  and half a rung down from  if you can put that in context I mean  is an absolute beginner she knew nothing about this business two and a half years ago
What had she done before she came to you?
She was the office junior
right
And she had one or two hires including higher art and then somebody said oh that would be good for the P R department  is looking for staff so she now is doing a superb job running a marketing operation, editing an internal newspaper  it all herself and erm  all of that I taught her, now I want to move her on to the stage where she can get professional recognition for this, now that is what I call an absolute beginner 
yeah so do the certificate
to do the certificate
yes
and then with great rapidity after that the diploma so that she could be erm
do you know I'm still foxed about  saying  to do it 
well but the important thing is she's engaged to be married I would reckon by the time she's about twenty-six she'll be looking for time out to have a family but by that time hopefully she's  and when she's thirty-two or thirty-three can come back into the business and say I've got a  and the door opens that much more easily
Of course, I mean the government view is that people will come back with S V Q's and that is what's going to do it.
Being  certainly lost an opportunity by not being it's only body there is an editing element in the book publishing section from the P G B and there are elements relating to us in the S P G  of the Periodical Training Council and there will be bits of them in the public relations in the marketing one of which I've got a copy of the draft, but  you know there is nothing all embracing B T E C do graphics and journalism but there is no single forum, I mean that's what so astonishing and interestingly somebody at B T E C told me the other day there's been a bit of a problem about the the book editing part of the editing level three element um, and that's partly political as to editing versus production because production's level four and editing is level three, and that has made some problems apparently
right, right what I see as an interesting possibility the papers that we got in this week from Telford College that came to me
About open learning
About open learning and they've got an H N C in Business Communications, now they also say that you could do this as a student at the college.
There are three elements of that that fall within the scope of B A I E type learning one is an interviewing technique, one is an introduction to public relations
yeah interviewing in terms of staff interviewing 
I don't know it was a two liner, um an intro an introduction to marketing and P R and an introduction to internal communications  were talking about you know the house newspaper, now that's the 
and this is distance learning?
yeah
yes
This is three elements out of about nine or ten, now if they could be persuaded that if people phoned us up  and said blah blah blah I want to learn this we could say well Telford will let you do this one unit of the course, they learn the one unit of the course, they say right I'd now like to learn about let's say photography and we find out that Queen Margaret's College in their course have an element on photography so we point the student in that direction and then they do this  hold on a second 
but you can't you can't dip into modules of that can you don't you have to do the whole thing?
Why can't they dip into modules because once they've learned that they then come to us and we say right you're at the stage where you can do the certificate in Industrial Editing sit our exam
But I think the difficulties buying into sections of an H N C course
Well that would be up to the colleges, if they're commercially astute they'll say right yeah twenty-five quid for that, in fact it would be a lot less because it's only for three months  
but I don't think, I don't think  I think you have to pay a candidate fee as well as the course fees so you 
right, well that's the sort of things that I think we want to find out and in slower time I was actually going to ring the  yeah at Telford and say speak to me about this and maybe pop in one morning on my way into town and just say this is the idea how does it grab you and if they say you're not on fine, but it's things like that that I think we want to explore.
Napier have said that once they get this course up and running there's absolutely no reason why experienced people like us can't dip in and out for a one off
ya the other people who I think would be quite interested at looking at something like that would be the new Business Development Centre at Queen Margaret I think that's much more up their line
is this erm is this Ann Packard enterprises this?
No, no no this is them wanting to get off a course off the ground
right
in fact the girl who did the mailing for them didn't do it properly so in fact it's unlikely to happen erm  they asked me because I know that since she's now leaving the Vice-Principal through network erm  and  and they were thinking of getting something together like that, I didn't write this that's not my writing but just let me tell you I don't write a twenty- four clock, twenty-four hour clock with full stops in it
aha right it's a bit odd isn't it?
erm  so no certainly they asked me about it and so on but I think that rather like their food forum they might like to get a communications forum going erm because they've been thinking about having a Business Club and various other things because they're involved with the  Management Programme and all sorts of things and they maybe going to do some training for heads and people like that
I mean  this is something that we could maybe be of help to in fact maybe something that I could be of help to them on because I actually do lectures on public relations how to assess what I mean at a very basic level you want to communicate with press how do you do it but before you do it why do you want to do it.
Have you made up your mind what your message what've you got to tell the press this is how you go about targeting 
I know I had to explain to somebody in Chambers the other day something to do with the Corpus that it wasn't where was the story there wasn't a story
right
erm
people get great ideas we want to give this a big show at the press to which I say well ho ho ho step back
but they are going to be running short courses there about
well, if they were interested in speaking to me I could probably put them on to not just myself but members of my flight, it isn't my flight it's  flight erm and there are several of us in Scotland who could come in and do things like that for a modest remuneration erm
ya, they're feeling their way it's only been open
I mean you know  well  is probably just about to become a member of our flight I mean he's going through he's just about to go to the R A F College in Cranwell 
yes to do what?
There is a specialist Public Relations Flight in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserves
yes and  in the Air Force Reserves
he's just about to come into it
Oh really
Yes
He's the young lad who was at S T D he's now working for himself
that's right, that's right and  now that he's shaken off the Scottish Office I invited him to come along to it as well so we may find 
but how do you I mean do you have to be taken on as officers of the R A F
You have to go through a short course at the R A F College Cranwell and then once that that teaches you the R A F side of it makes you into an officer because at the end of the day you maybe there to do public relations but if the spaghetti hits the fan you're an officer and you're a combatant and you know you carry a gun around when you're in a war zone and you know you're expected to use it and if the senior officer of the unit next to you gets shot and you're the most senior officer then you take over
you're then commanding the unit 
it's always a bit a it came home to me  with great a vigour and enthusiasm when I was walking round the kitting station at R A F Innsworth with a supermarket trolley getting it filled with kit and when I got to the end they handed me my dog tags and my gun, I thought what have I let myself in for  because I'd never worn dog tags before and I'd never had a gun with live ammunition in it that got strapped to my hip and you suddenly realise, I'm going into a real war it was quite a nerve racking experience for a few days
But had you had presumably training in all these things
oh I trained in all of these things yes
where did you do your training here or down 
Catterick usually
Oh really, yes
with the R A F regiment yes um I mean that's where we do the military side of things in fact I'm just organising that now for the flight for February but we have the probably the most famous member of the flight for it was founded in nineteen forty was H E Bates
Oh really
erm
now I was reading about him a few days ago
that's right because they've just released papers after thirty years of work that he was doing for the M O D he was actually doing it in his role as a member of the P R flight, Beaver Brooke sold the government this idea
just so can we get back to research about beginners because I'm worried about how much there is on the tape and you're about to drive to Pitlochrie erm  basically you have to define a beginner to see what they want to do
sure that's right but I mean I think the beginners are the people coming in new to the bis 
when you say new to the business do you mean new in terms of employment as opposed to say graduates from Queen Margaret or Napier or anywhere else?
I would say in employment yes, or people that want to get employment example would be  yeah at  M D secretary suddenly shot into the job of producing the company newspaper now I mean somebody like  very quickly has to get to grips with this obviously cannot give up six months to go and do it so you do it on a half day release basis.
but she's had quite a lot of training in other things actually and with the man marketing department that they've got there they might not need that the  thing coming up I've just had what's interesting about that and what I don't like about it is not to  because I have a lot of respect for her.
But they don't tell you who is actually doing the delivering so you're buying blind
There is nothing here either that I see that is immediately um relating to the B A I E type of business
effective writing skills, presentation skills and working with the media I've got here Thursday twenty second nineteen ninety four
Now I've got here ah learning outcomes erm some topics preparation and agenda type management issues  the meaning control skills that doesn't 
well time management could be for a lot of people
yeah
that was something people had asked for working for the media here 
but it wouldn't  er now you've got a different programme to me, I've got Learning Outcomes again is that the same one?
No this
I've got the  I've got
this is 
right I've probably  that one 
no that's just the 
I really just wanted to see er just wanted to see the sort of range of things they did now this is more like it you see Effective Writing, Report Writing, Technical Report Writing, Business Sales Corres , Editing House Journals  Writing for Publication, Desk Top Publishing, things like working with the media these are more the sort of things that I would see people 
Oh that's for in-house training for actual customers in their own organisations isn't it?
sure but again I mean if there was a market for this I am sure that to take that and splinter it off into a unit it costs money to get people that want to come into this business  
but the interesting is I was talking to one of the training people at one of the big finance houses recently about whether or not one could piggy back on some of their courses or whether in fact some of the in-house stuff they do they would like to deliver to external B A I E people
right
so that's something else to look at, but it takes time
but I've got this C I T B N V Q stuff really to sort of to see what went into an N V Q's package
well if you'd like to come to Dunderth Street one day you can see twelve inches of it
I see  erm it also misheard me here because I'm involved in designing a television series as well on the construction industry also gives me some interesting data about the industry  was it ten per cent of the nation's workforce works for the construction industry which in an average year will turn over thirty five billion pounds
well the industry  C I T B industry training board premises are just near one of my sister's houses erm in Norfolk isn't it in Norfolk somewhere? yes 
Kings Lynn  Kings Lynn
well you drive through it on the main road and it goes both sides of the road
I've never been to Kings Lynn
Can I ask you em  age 
R A F  me
please to complete the form thank you 
fifty two 
thank you sex, we think you're male, accent, do you have an accent?
Yes, Scottish
erm  do you happen to know
about thirty two  and female
um  right I think I need you to sign it actually so if you could just sign here
