Now we've got about seven books out .
We've got another one we haven't used yet and that what you gonna .
So  Pickwick Papers and .
Got a new one?
No.
No.
Give us any one then.
Christmas Carol.
Christmas Carol.
Okay shh.
Now do stop murmuring.
You could've used you could've used Little Doris
Who wrote Scrooge?
Barnaby Rudge Martin 
Christmas Carol.
Yeah I know I know I've read the  one but there's a Christmas Carol called Scrooge in it?
Yeah.
Oh alright.
Christmas Carol has a certain old miser in it.
Scrooge.
Scrooge.
Okay good.
Now looking round I prefer you to be in twos and threes for the job you're going to do.
Erm I'm not saying you can't well what do I say.
Erm can you is it possible to get twos rather threes.
Can you sit 
We'll be in threes.
Mm?
We'll be in threes.
Yeah alright.
Shh.
Okay now  Neil we need your attention cos you you got a list of what you're going to do.
Now.
So what you're going to do is erm sounds complicated but once you start you'll see how it works.
Now if you remember if you find in your book er you started just doing er a hundred er mini saga fifty words mini saga of David Copperfield  okay?
Most of you did roughed it out on the back and some very quick workers who got it back in the front.
Yeah?
Now if you leave can I suggest leave erm leave half a page empty if you haven't got it in the front yet.
Don't go don't do any  If you haven't copied it up yet leave half a page.
If you want leave a page for some homework.
Jenny what have you got to tell me?
Okay well I'll give I'll give one back I've got them here.
Now erm no if you so leave a say leave a page would be the easiest way to fill in your mini saga account of David Copperfield meeting his new father.
If you haven't got it in already.
Er some of you have got it in.
I can see  they've got it in.
Erm put a heading er, The test of David Copperfield, but you're not doing the test you're making up the test.
you know in the er first year with Miss  I genuinely wrote this thing right.
And they  this paragraph okay.
Once you'd done a new paragraph like they did like this  blah blah blah  in here.
They she did a new paragraph like that and then she carried on like that.
All the way.
Yeah  all the way down the page.
So funny .
what the paragraph was?
No.
Listen please.
Erm each pair  each pair no I haven't just listen.
Can you listen er each pair of you now will get a job of doing this.
Now listen cos I don't want to explain it more than once.
I'm going to ask you to make up make up and write down four questions on the passage.
Right?
Now then er find the correct answers.
You what you're going to do I'll explain briefly.
You're going to make up a a test sheet each pair er you're going to cop you're going to rough it out in your book.
Work out the answers for the  test.
Then you can put the test on a piece of paper just the questions and I'm going to give the piece of paper to somebody else to answer.
So each you're going to test each other on this.
Now how's it work.
Finding correct answers.
Now we start off I'll ask you I give you about ten minutes that's all it doesn't take long.
First one an easy question.
Now what I mean by an easy question something like
What he  where did he go 
Yes hang hang on .
Somebody suggested an easy question was anybody would get right.
Who was say  where go on.
Right which where did where did he spend his holiday.
And the answer would be
Yarmouth.
Great Yarmouth or Yarmouth whatever it's called.
Is it Great Yarmouth or Yarmouth.
Yarmouth.
Great Yarmouth.
Yarmouth.
And you'd get a mark.
Okay that would be worth one mark .
Yarmouth.
You just  
Now and after this question 
and Sabrina you did and Andrea's .
which means a sentence answer.
Sentence answer two marks.
A more difficult question or a difficult question sentence answer sentence question sentence length three marks three marks.
Lastly lastly a longer question where the answer would have to be two and three sentences  erm yes but don't tell everybody.
Erm  shh.
Right I'm not giving you long to do this don't waste time.
Now you've gotta make up four questions.
The first one's easy.
You some of you are already thinking of easy things to ask.
Could be a one word answer.
Question two the answer must be in a sentence.
So if if you ask the question erm or if you ask the question who something something the answer would be a name the person who did this was so and so.
The you've gotta you mark it you give full marks for a sentence answer.
So when you mark somebody's test paper you don't just put the name and not the sentence you've gotta work out one mark out of two whatever.
You work out a marking .
Now the difficult the last one is a hard one in the sense that it'll ask the person to write a paragraph, several sentences.
So it could you could ask a question like erm, What was the relationship like between David and his mother?
Or you could ask a question like, What was the  father?
Or or some vague question like that er for which you must work out the answers.
Now so what you're going to do you work together but I would prefer you in twos and threes  I think third person's redundant.
Why why don't erm why don't you two work together?
Why not?
Best friends.
But I'm but I'm working with
Yeah but if I I'll only get one test paper from all three of you won't I?
Erm
Yeah what's he on about?
Okay well see how it goes.
Right erm well actually you could work on your own if you want to.
I'm getting short of test papers.
So right here we go.
Right will you you may work together to work out.
Work out your questions and give the answers with a mark scheme.
You can mark these in your book yeah.
No you can do them at the front.
Oh oh if it's gonna be rough put them at.
Oh how rough is it gonna be.
Rough notes at the back.
Cos when you've worked out the questions you can put them at the front.
Thank you.
I just  from here.
D'ya want some more?
No.
I am.
On you go ten minutes work out your four questions as per .
Sir where shall I write the answers?
Erm you put the answers under your question.
Because the person won't see those.
Er Jenny were you away on Monday?
Have you got that on tape?
That song by Silk?
I do.
Mind you all of them .
Have you noticed that?
You know how Ham is.
D'ya know how Ham is?
No.
Sir who's Ham?
Sir who's Ham?
Is that a dog.
No it's not.
Ham is er
Cos at the end it goes the dog.
I know.
Ham.
There's a new dog a strange new dog in the kennel.
Ham is the brother of Emily the older brother like a man.
Er sorry what am I talking about.
Ham is the brother of somebody like .
Older man who's who's living with them in Emily's house.
Okay?
Yeah do write down the answers.
That's going to add up to seven eight nine ten marks.
Come quickly think of a decent question.
If you work it out.
But you must know  
How long was he there for?
answer cos you're gonna mark 
No fortnight.
Write in your book.
my book isn't he.
Who who's got it?
I left it at home.

Sir Caroline hasn't got her book.
So she can she write it in that one.
What book?
Her exercise book.
Oh well hang on.
I've got one of your's here.
Oh it's finished.
Well where's the new one?
You've got it.
The new one?
Yeah.
You marked it.
I haven't got your new one I've got your old one.
I can give you your old one back.
Er you must you must be clear of what the right answer is.
Because you're gonna mark some of these answers.
Do we write the answers in the book sir.
Yeah you can put your answer in the book.
I'll give you a sheet of paper to copy 
I gave you my new one you know the yellow one.
No I haven't oh is that your's?
Yeah.
That's Zoe's.
That's not mine.
There's another one.
That's the only yellow one I've got.
Seriously it's the only yellow one I've got .
You know you know the one with the erm thingie work inside it?
Yeah I know I know which yeah but I haven't got it.
The only one I've got is Zoe's.
It's only yellow book I've got.
I know that because it wouldn't fit in the box.
Oh have I got any books?
But I don't have it either.
No I certainly haven't got your yellow one.
Er why haven't you got the other one?
Eh?
Well what are you doing, working out questions?
Yeah.
I'll give you some paper just to jot them down in cos you can cos you  
He's gone and lost my book.

Right about five more minutes.
You must have the answers written down.

Put number four  and why was David worried.
Mm.
paragraph .
Mm.
Right when when   I know but the se I'm gonna give you a piece of paper for the set.
So everyone every everyone everyone should have a copy of the questions in their book just to tell what they've worked on.
Yep.
You can put it that's okay.
Yes leave a page.
Right we're also going to give a mark for spelling and presentation.
Up to five marks.
Have you past the middle page?
Okay?
So spelling and presentation
Sir what's she gonna write in?
Right I'll give her some paper in a minute.
Er now I would suggest that if somebody does not make a single spelling mistake and it or or grammatically error and it's perfectly well presented give them full five marks okay.
That's what I would suggest.
Work out work out a scheme for spelling and presentation.
So you might say one mistake perfectly presented four marks.
Okay work out an allowance of up to five marks for spelling and punctuation.
Write it in your mark scheme.
Now what are you here for?
Yes I I've tell her I've only got these now.
Er what you asking me sorry?
You're asking me a question?
Hold on I'll give you some paper to make a note of them.
What  that's where he lives.
That's his house that's his house.
doesn't sound like a house does it?
But that's the name that .
Yeah.
Here you are er make a copy  Er when you're ready when you've worked out all the answers one person in the group should copy out the questions on like an exam sheet.
Just the questions which you're gonna give to somebody else to mark.
Now he's gonna blame me for the loss of my book.
You know you know the one  
Don't don't pay for it.
the poems inside there.
I'm not gonna pay for it.
hell.
I I 
I thought you said you left it at home.
No this one I left at home but the other one the yellow one he's got that one.
Yeah.
You hadn't written that one  had you?
Written what?
What did you write in it?
I wrote that this
The mini saga.
Yeah no not the mini saga .
 
Yeah.
No no no the one on the you know the first poem we did?
Yeah yeah.
If you're ready to copy your questions onto the sheet.
Here you are put it on there.
Have you got your questions read?
Right could you make sure you've worked out what gets five marks and what's get what gets nought marks for spelling and presentations.
Yes first question's easy.
Do it this order yeah.
marking scheme has to be like that?
Yeah that's the marking scheme yeah.
It's gonna add to fifteen marks altogether.
marking scheme.
Erm
Fifteen.
Fifteen yeah.
Cos you've got a bonus of five marks for spelling and presentation.
So if somebody writes brilliantly very neatly with no mistakes they might get five extra marks.
And then you've gotta work out what gets nought.
Are you mark knocking off one mark for each mistake?
I'll leave it to you.
But you must know a scheme.
You can't mark without a scheme.
You must make a scheme yeah.
Otherwise it's not fair on the  markist Are you ready to copy the questions out?
You two ready to copy?
You make up the scheme yeah.
But it's on spelling and presentation.
You were guessing .
Yeah er how how much  have you got room to do the  oh right I'll your book now then.
Erm it's .
Right paper coming round for people who are ready to copy the questions out.
Er you should give an instruction at the top of the sheet like an exam paper and I write it neatly and you put  yeah five bonus marks goes five four three two one.
You've gotta work out what you said .
Well the questions  one two three four.
Oh you get one mark for the first one
Yes that's right.
You going to copy no you've got .
Put the instructions at the top.
Put test instructions.
Read these questions carefully and write 
Well obviously 
You've gotta write down why.
easy easier.
Put the instruction at the top.
Put your questions .
Anyone else ready to copy the questions on their sheet before I 
ready to copy it out.
Good here you are.
Have you got one .
Yes okay then I suggest 
Pardon what?
Yeah.
That was Sabrina by the way.
She smells.
Anyone else ready to copy the questions on the exam sheet?
You're ready?
His  what?
You know what me and  are doing in maths.
Right you know when sir comes up with his marking book right you know.
Sometimes he walking round with his marking book and he holds it at an angle you know so you can see all the answers.
Me and  just sit there copying them.
So funny.
And he just sat I swear  and then he's just sitting there   
Er are you going to anyone still not able to er  think you're ready?
Are you going to put write out the question .
What's the what's the problem?
So nice of you to tell me what you're writing.
Right well just hang just hang on er oh 
Testing testing one two three testing.
Cos I'm talking that's why.
I am.
You got a new book 
Yeah the yellow one.
Eh?
No.
Yeah.
He spat on my face once in the first year.
He's disgusting.
Oh yeah .
Someone fancies him.
Can't remember who it is.
What are you doing?
Five minutes  finished the question sheets.
So can you get on with it please?
Sir?
Just say that again please.
What what d'ya think  what does that tell you about the man .
You know Sarah  you know Sara  she fancies .
Really?
How d'ya know?
I have my contacts.
I think it was Lynne that told me.
Is it alright if I say something to her?
No.
Or is no one supposed to know?
I don't know but you know.
No just goes to her erm, Who d'ya fancy Sarah.
Like that.
Now how are we doing you've got the  let's see oh you've all got this is one question sheet among the lot of you?
Mhm.
So you you will accept for number two just the two words you don't want a sentence?
Okay so long as you know.
You must know what you want.
So if somebody just writes those two words they get two marks.
You see.
Cos if you said erm answer in complete sentences they obviously wouldn't get two marks you see?
Are they supposed to get four marks for that  
Oh yes yes that's right.
One two three four.
Now er in the last sentence you've got five marks to give for spelling and punctuation.
Right up to five marks.
So work out roughly erm obviously something that's absolutely perfect and very very neat is probably worth five.
What happens if it's perfect no mistakes but it's untidy knock one off or two off.
Work out a rough way of what you're going to give for for
Can we write the question for that one 
punctuation .
Yeah I'm giving you a sheet to do it on now.
Write the questions on the sheet and I'll give the sheet to 
write it out.
Well it would be nice to have two copies on yours if that's alright.
Because there's three of you.
No you just do the questions.
You just put test question one question two you just put question on here.
Yeah.
Okay?
But could you do two copies between the four er three of you.

When we've finished it are you gonna give

Yes right okay.
Er five minutes or so everyone should've written out their questions .
Are you ready Freda?
Can you have you copied the question paper?
Oh you need a sheet of paper right.
Er tell you what  what we're going to do.
You're going to write out the questions and I'm going to give your questions to another person and then you're going to get it back to mark it.

And what happens to the little oxygens once they're discarded is that they don't go back and join an oxygen molecule.
What they actually do is the two independent ones join together and instead of have separate Os you get O two again.

If you put down the example I  I actually marked the  example but then I realized going back through the book that obviously the example was given for you there anyway.

That, that boy was  's brother.
Yeah, I know.
Sir, do you wanna say something?
The wind was a  of darkness, among the gusty trees.
The moon was a ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas.
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor.
And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding.
The highwayman came riding up to the old inn door.
He'd a french cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of  at his chin, a coat of claret velvet and breeches of brown doe skin.
They fitted with ne'er a wrinkle.
His boots were up to the thigh, and he rode with a jewelled twinkle, his pistols but a twinkle, his rapier hilt a twinkle under the jewelled sky.
Over the cobbles he clattered, and clashed in the darkened yard, and he tapped with his  on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.
He whistled a tune to the window, but who should be waiting there?
But the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess.
The landlord's daughter, plaiting a dark red love knot, into her long black hair.
And in the dark old inn yard, a stable  creaked.
Where Tom the ostler listened, his face was white and peaked.
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay.
But he loved the landlord's daughter, the landlord's red-lipped daughter.
Dumb as a dog he listened, and heard the robber say, One kiss my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize tonight, but I shall be back with the yellow gold, before the morning light.
Though didst they pass me sharply, and hang through the day.
Then look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell shall bar the way.
He rose up light in the stirrups, He scarce could reach her hand, but she loosened her  casement, his face burnt like a brand.
As the black  perfume came tumbling over his breast, and he kissed it sweet  in the moonlight, a sweet  in the moonlight, and he tugged at his reigns in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.
He did not come in the dawning.
He did not come at noon.
But out oh tawny sunset, before the rise on moon, when the road was a gypsy ribbon, looping the purple moor, a red coat troop came marching, marching, marching, King George's men came marching, up to the old inn door.
They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead, but they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of a narrow bed.
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets their side.
There was death at every window, and hell on one dark window.
That Bess could see through her casement, the road that he would ride.
They tied her up to a tension, with many si sniggering jest.
They bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast.
Now come good watch they listened, she heard the robber moan, she heard the dead man say, look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell shall bar the way.
she twisted her hands behind her, but all the knots held good.
She  her hands to her fingers, all wet with sweat or blood.
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years.
Till now on the stroke of midnight, cold on the stroke of midnight, the tip of one finger touched it, the trigger at last was hers.
The tip of one finger touched it, she strove no more for the rest, up sh up she stood to attention with the barrel beneath her breast.
She would not risk their hearing, she would not strive again, for the road lay bare in the moonlight, blank and bare in the moonlight, and the blood of her veins in the moonlight, throbbed to her lovers refrain.
Had they heard it?
The horse's hooves ringing clear?
In the distance, were they deaf that they could not hear?
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding, riding, riding, the highwayman came riding.
The redcoat looked at the .
She stood up straight and still.
In the frosty silence  In the echoing night.
Nearer and nearer he came, her face was like a light.
Her eyes grew wide for one moment, she drew one last deep breath.
Then her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight, and warned him with her death.
He turned and sped westward, he did not know who stood, bowed with her head o'er a musket, drenched with her own  blood.
Not till the dawn he heard it, and slowly blanched to hear, how Bess the landlord's daughter, the landlord's black eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.
Back he sped like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky.
With the white road smoking behind him, and his rapier brandished high.
Blood, blood red were his spurs,moon, rhymed red with his velvet coat, when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.
And still of a winter's night they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas.
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight, over the purple moor, a highwayman comes riding, riding, riding, a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn door.
Over the cobbles he clatters, and clangs in the darkened yard, and he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.
He whistles a tune to the window, and who shall be waiting there?
But the landlord's black eyed daughter.
Bess, the landlord's daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair .
Lisa Stansfield?
Yeah.
No.
I think, I think that song's rubbish.
What do you hate the charity it's for?
Is it for a charity?
Yeah.
What is it for?
Aids.
Oh.
Well, that's their problem.
Why do you hate it so much?
Because it's their own fault for going to, nobody told them to go and do it, did they?
So what, are you telling me you're gonna be a nun, and never have sex.
I'm not saying that, but if you're gonna do it, you might as well, you know do it properly.
It's their fault, I don't have any sympathy for them.
What, what's going on?
The aids people.
Who's got aids.
You.
Caroline .
If it was from a blood transplant.
Who?
You.
Didn't you?
Mmm
No, but say you did get one though 
No, no if it was from a blood transplant then I'd feel sorry for them, but if it was from you know, then I don't.
What if you just  got raped by a man with aids.
Yeah, well I'd feel sorry for them again, but you know, if they went and did it willingly, it's their, that's their problem.
Who's got aids?
Nobody.
What's this about Lisa Stansfield, George Michael, whatever?
She did this thing for the aids people.
So?
Yeah, and we were just talking about it.

All of you.
Number four stands  complete each one so that C is a two fold centre of rotation.
Now that is half the diagram.
You have to finish the diagram, and when it's finished, C will be the centre of the two-fold rotation.
So you simply do that, and when it pivots about C, halfway will look like that, then it'll come back what it started off at.
So use the other half of the diagram, and then when you've done the other half, the whole thing is a two-fold rotation about the centre of C.
Oh, right.
Have you got a rubber?
You've got my rubber.
