I can't tell you everybody, two more to do.
So those people, when we go for assembly they stay behind  and I'll do the work with them first.
And I want somebody to help the little ones  later on.
It's much easier that way.
Okay?
Right.
How do you spell  box?
Anybody know?
What?
Now this is a hard one.
So think about it, don't just throw your hands in the air.
Can anybody spell  er  between?

Now, a lot of people have trouble when they spell words that have shh  or ba in them.
So, Kimberley, could you spell the word  shoe.

A  sa 
capital S.

That's the whole  thing.
Excellent!
Well done.
Really looking forward to this.

But what happens?
Or you could just write about  how you  enjoyed the story or you didn't enjoy the story, or you think it's a great story, or what actually happened in the story.
Was it another story entirely?
I don't know what we have to put.

I never have  it's mine actually I told them they have to be very careful, I'm wondering if they put the right size in, excuse me can you go right out the way
they're not the right size, because the, the
it's just the second one that's got jammed
no, it's just that people are borrowing it and ripping it apart, it is a ve it is an extremely expensive stapler
Miss my mum's got a bigger one at home and
nothing I can do about that 
Shall we try the other one?
Miss 
Jean's got it 
oh dear
now, not now, somebody's knocked it, there's all these droppings on the floor
slightly to one side
Yes, mm  mm does  right  right I'm sorry about that, yes
I've done the envelope
let's staple the card, for mums, are you gonna put anything inside?
What are you gonna put on the front?
All of it
Yes I know, but who's it to?
Mummy
Go and test your jigsaw yes, go and test your jigsaw
good
Need staples
Oh you need staples well Mrs  has the stapler, if you go and borrow it, how you going to cut that up?
Think about it 
Now if she's passed that level, then she's er, it's ten points
reading
I see.
the chronological age is eight, but her reading ability is ten point six plus
Yeah.
depending on which one she used
Yeah.
but when we come to testing them for reading erm on the national curriculum to say level one, level two, level three
Yeah and the, I know from 
and you're going up
you know she said she was sort of level three plus when she did that
Right.
I understand.
Well when she's level Clare means she's well ahead of herself and now she's got, you could give her books that were appropriate for a ten year old and she could read them
Yeah.
because she, she had that ability
Yeah.
she's very good, whatever
 
but you, I don't know which we, you just have to say next time you see her oh which reading test do you use and you can work out, how, what, you know, I've got a reading test somewhere I'll see if I can find it for you, just show you
well you don't
just pop it next to it with your name on, good Jean
I wanna take it home
I'm gonna let you take it home
we, we, we stick it together?
No, I'm gonna let you take it home
okay people if you've finished tidy up, you two go and tidy up please, thank you
Can I sit next to you?
And I promise I won't fall on you, no
I know, I keep, well I'd, you get worried because if it came on gently, you know, smoothly you know what, to come on so quickly I'm
 

Right we'll just have a
 

Who's sitting there, anybody there?
No I've just brought one over
Oh okay
Are you cold Dolores?
Not at all 
we actually had a very cold Christmas
Oh
we've had the coldest year
I thought you were over for that
seventy five degrees I mean, and it was really cold and when we got back it was cold as well, it's only the last four weeks that we've been able to use the outdoor pools again
it's a good life, yes
Is it?
You'd recommend it then 
the standard of living is  
would ya?
Definitely yes, we wish we'd done it sooner
How you getting on with the erm, you know, being a second class citizen?
Erm


you can watch for them, oh gosh well, in a while respect their religious beliefs and they're at terms to
Yes, but they don't respect yours.
They don't actually 
No 
no, erm, I mean when, you're not allowed to practise any religion out there, so any
Really?
religious services we go to have to be done in secret and
Really?
Oh yes it's ver I mean the priest, it says it has the British Embassy, he has, he is an American serviceman and he actually has 
 
his own bodyguard, a driver who's been trained.
Good God
Yeah, so, and, the
who were the religious police who were actually watching, so we haven't gone back for a while
erm, so that the
well the thing is you go to somewhere like Dubai which is in the same peninsular and within half a mile of the, of the college there, there's an Anglian church
yeah
and every one just gets on with it.
Well I just thought as a woman not, you know as a person
oh yes, honestly some shops you're not allowed to go into, you have a window
yeah that's right
Is it because you're a woman or because you're a foreigner or?
Because you're a woman
like an ice cream shop, no women allowed inside
women aren't allowed into video stores or erm
Oh you can't imagine it 
tape stores that sort of thing
You can't drive your car
You can't drive the car
that's one of the worse I think
I mean if, if you go shopping
all on my own
but you, they, they are, they're very sweet, the second class citizens of all, I mean they say they're cherished and looked after and
but they're not allowed to drive, they're not allowed to work
oh they're not allowed to work?
No.
Oh it's not that bad


No they're not allowed to work
You've changed your mind now
Are they allowed to have the babies?
That's all they're there for.
Oh
That's all they're there for is to breed basically


I mean it's a lovely way of life for them I suppose, but
I mean within a fifty kilometre er outline of the Riyadh city there are police check points and the people are checked going in and out, none of them allowed 
 
yeah, they're not even allowed free travel in their own country, but they are, it's a police state, they are checked and double-checked, and I mean the things we hear now about, they have a lot of Philippine workers there
Mm
a lot of Indian workers, all the construction workers are Indians and all sort of shop people are all Filipinos, all the supermarkets are Filipinos in checkouts and the shelves, and that's the, a lot of the Filipino women that go out, go out as servants and of course the husband
 
Oh they have a hell of a life haven't they?
Mm
The minute she becomes pregnant and can't hide it any more she's actually put into prison
yeah, they're just, they're just disposed of, they're sent into prison, they're, the, the prisons er
any food, they have their babies in prison
Hell
a Victorian prison and after services have been done and collection for the prisoners, erm, you know that was the international they were getting
Yeah
they would, I mean we've heard stories one of the, John one of the school drivers who's an Indian, he couldn't bel they bring them out in big large groups.
erm, he said one of the friends he'd come out with he became a house boy in a house, and the lady took a fancy to him, took him to bed, the husband found him and he was later found 
Oh my 
God 
That's the way that they deal with men
ooh
So really nothing's moved since Moses' time 
No 
has it, in that respect?
 

Definitely not, there's nothing you can do, no there is nothing you can do, and the restrictions on the
I mean the  Matawa who are the religious police
they have a lot of clout, a lot of clout, erm, we were in the gold souk
down the old markets before we came away and there was two  Matawa and they have big sort of straggly beards and they
are shorter than everybody else's and, but this one had a, a cape on with a gold braid which meant he was a big high up one, and he was just absolutely paranoid, I mean they reckon that the  Matawa are such fanatics that they are just Greeks, you know they just, you know these ones that just
Yeah
themselves and cut themselves and for, for Allah and whatnot hit and he had two policemen, now if they had, they're, they're not allowed to stop you and ask for your identification unless they have policeman with them, but they can arrest you and take you to their police station and they can be quite intimidating and, but they were going round, there was American service in there who have little cards written on it, they said they don't have to cover their heads they, they're allowed to do just as well as they please
Oh, are they allowed to drive?
because they said I believe they're not, erm and he stopped these two American servicemen
Mm
and he shouted at them
to cover their heads and, cos of Ramadan and erm  you know they, they really took the Mick out of them you know, and then, when
was getting really cross and was beginning to call the police over she just produced a card and they just throw it and said this means nothing to me, this means nothing to me, cover your head and she just laughed at them and walked away, but he, he pounced on a Filipino girl who was actually wearing jeans, and socks and said her jeans were too short
they're just crazy people and very hypocritical, very hypocritical, there's no respect for them whatsoever
Mm apart from that you had a great time


Definitely
in the compound?
Yes it's very nice
It's very nice with friends if you could of gone out there
Yeah made a lot of nice friends yeah, there's a lot of friends teaching the school, there's a lot of, there's sixteen Irish erm a lot of Australians, er two Americans, there's a lady from Sweden
and, you just meet so many people in some, different countries.
Is there a lot of social life
do they organize that?
There is a lot of social life there, people do tend to, to entertain more in their homes
Yeah 
Yeah 
and the people worked in the big hotels
but I mean would any, is there anywhere, where they could come
can you drink on campus?
Oh yes you can drink
Is that alright?
you, you be very careful about driving drinking your parts 
Pick it up now, go on 
Yeah
cos if you were stopped or you had an accident 
I say pick it up now 
erm, but everybody home brews, I mean there's some people who've been out there who make beautiful
Cointreau
Oh
er
That religion?
yeah on
estate, er the big, big compound they have stills and there's a lady who actually does it as a living
Oh right
she, gets
pure alcohol that's called
and then you buy it all first to make your Cointreau and all the
wine is ever so easy, this, the big bottles of grape juice you buy there, go in the sugar, plenty of yeast, there you go, you have thirty six litres
I dread to have grape juice over there, they must think when they go to shop
Well


you buy one case in one supermarket and then
And then another there
but you don't go in and buy five cases of


and you don't know what you're gonna do with it


Thirsty work, eh?
Yeah
But everybody home brews
 

Homemade gin
There's another one called Jeddah gin, which is gin made with potatoes and oranges, grapefruits, lemons
is that powerful?
I haven't had Jeddah gin yet, I've had
but I haven't had the Jeddah gin yet
Just leave the recipe with us
write it on the blackboard
It's the new technological thing
horizontal
do you wanna change anything in your site  I don't know


So how long you back for?
Till twenty fifth
Oh are ya?
Have you made any plans?
No just having
no it's fine, I had a lovely drink over there, I've just left it
 

Fine 
And what about the actual teaching there?
It's very good
Is it?
Yeah
 

It's not important
The maximum number of children you can have in a class is twenty
and I have a maid for one day a week and she does all my backing up, wet the walls and
and she does all that sort of work for me
What nationality is she?
Er, she's English, they're all, their husbands are all out in British Aerospace contracts and, and  I get
which is quite nice
What you do the national curriculum then?
Oh yeah we do the national curriculum yeah
What year did you end up with?
Er first year juniors
Have ya?
which is quite nice because I've never taught that
so I want to stay there next year
Do you have a lot of changes with staff?
Are there some people who don't kind of like it?
Er, it's not so much that, there is a, a nucleus  of contract staff which are there permanently, but erm, most of the staff are local contract, people, teachers who are out with their husbands.
Mm, so they might be
 
There's, we have a lot of Australians teaching over there, a lot of Canadian and a lot of British as well 
but they can come and go, I mean the year four they lost two teachers in the last two weeks cos their husbands got other jobs and the contracts were just terminated and, so it's quite a, a moveable circle of people, er, but just, they have actually sacked one of the lads that came out with us, they won't be renewing his contract next year, he only had a two year contract
Why?
He didn't really live up to expectations, he wasn't  he didn't work hard enough I feel, he was lazy and he was too used to teaching abroad
class room, give the children an exercise to do and that was it, they did it, and no questions were asked and that's how they want and the other guy was  he just did it himself he, he wasn't abusive but he, he wasn't good with the kids and
An attitude problem
he had, he had a definite attitude problem so they said they would relieve him of his contract  oh that's fair enough, they're paying you good money and they expect you to work hard and that's it  but we finish at one o'clock next term
why?
Because of the heat
So what time do you start?
Ten to eight
 

What time do you finish?
Normally it's half term
You work straight through without
No we have forty minutes lunch
Mm
and twenty minutes in the morning, but we work right through, skip lunch, finish at one o'clock then
ah that'll be much nicer way, good attitude isn't it?
Mrs  wouldn't like that would she?


She'd say now you're really pushing it trying to get home early aren't you Mrs ?
  

no the English news only comes on at half past ten at night and then you'll get what they wanted to hear, so you don't have to listen to the World Service
so they vet it do they?
Mm
Do they vet it?
Oh very much so, yeah 
 
very much so, yeah, you only hear what they want you to hear
But how do they vet it?
Do they just say bad things, or do they just say good things?
No they show only what they want to show, so if there's something they don't like they won't show it
Mm
so you don't actually get a true version of what happened 
So, no you won't know that we're trying to get the two pilots out of er
Libya
Libya and
the only thing they would, they would tell us about is what's happening in Iraq, there 
Did you know that erm, who was missing  Arrorat Arafat
they actually sacrificed their lives didn't they?
They died didn't they?
They dived into the sand didn't they, so he would survive at the back of the
well when the, the UN people, was it the UN people, were trapped in the raft
Oh yeah
he wasn't going to let them go, I mean we weren't told any of that on the news, there wasn't a word of that, it only be that from the papers that we'd got
there's no problem there, erm, but because we don't actually have a radio that gets us the World Service, the people didn't know what was going on, the only thing that we knew was that the air, because Riyadh is a military city
Mm
and there's a big air base there, where the big spy, the A W A C spy planes come in and out all the time and they worked constantly and the  were going in like and there was a lot of military aircraft to be
stocking up again because they thought they'd have to go in
Did you get
you don't actually it's just all 
 
goes up and it goes down, no one actually tells you
but you can tell from the amount of aircraft
and they train all pilots there as well so
yeah I think so
if I put those on there would you like to pass them out and then I could refill
that's right
Dolores a little more red?
No thanks I'm fine
John a little more red?
Just a drop, lovely
it's a nice blouse Penny
Thank you
is it Marks and Spencers'?
No it's erm
What do you do?
So that it's like erm, a dough
Yeah
what you break off pieces don't you?
It's not
it's sort of 
Oh you cook and then you break them off the rest of them
Well no, you, you sort of mix it all up and it's like a, a piece of dough, it's like, it's like a pastry
Yeah
inside it rather than 
and you just break
really, oh no I'd never thought that would work cos I thought that would 
You don't believe 
have to be a very low heat you know for microwaves
Yes yeah 
I mean tt meringues
it's amazing
not that I'm a meringue fan of course, but erm
I like the pastry, shortcrust
no, I'm not a bundle on
I tell ya, I just, I just had this sort of yearning for chocolate, ooh
no I'm not  no when I am I can't eat anything, if I was like that I just couldn't bear to be even in the same room as anybody who's eating, so no the urge of chocolate is possibly to do with fat 
we did the technology this morning anyway
Oh were you alright?
Well, the end results
you can't get blood out of a stone can you?
No
I could hardly believe that there's nobody on level three  mm and you see we done the Easter eggs and they can't join in, I have to say no, it's a shame you know the
and I can't even help them with that
It's very hard for
one or two of my small ones
but it's alright if you're not doing the
yeah that's right
I just give them a little 
you know er some of them they did a five piece jigsaw easter egg things that when they take them and an envelope to send them off to put it in, so when they take it home and fit it together it says happy easter.
Katie cut hers up into five hundred pieces 
More detail
and I said you'll have to fit it together again and she said I can't  they were all identical squares with squiggles on oh what a 
Put together 
yeah don't worry John I feel fine  famous last words 
I think it was just a bug and I think it was caused by
 

There seems to be an awful lot of people in this staff room today
how much wine did you have?
Julie 
but she's
It's still gotta be the
yeah it's so diffi I mean, alright we're, we're gonna be okay because we're
and we've, we've a steady occupation etcetera etcetera, but we just turn er, er, you know we're just blind to these people who've got nothing and there's more and more people have got nothing
Yeah
and we don't see it and it's disgraceful that for another five years they're going to get even less and less
I know, but we don't see 
 
that do we?
No, I don't know how some of them
and you know, I mean I know I'm a Geordie, Geordies are hard workers, I mean they're noted for their hard work and it's, it's horrible because they've always, they always suffer
Yeah
when there's any recession they're the first ones to lose 
Yeah 
out.
the North East they've always, they've always 
They've always been a precarious, yeah, I mean me dad used to work down the shipyard and you know you'd live in fear for when they would close the yards down 
Oh yeah 
and it happened so regularly all the yards being closed and you'd just be laid off and no
keep going back to
mm
You'd have one sense
but when William the Conqueror came I think it was
What windows?
when he became the gaffer
Yeah, do you want the windows closed?
but most people 
Do you want a window open?
Anyone
because erm the North East was so far away I think they was
oh no I've never heard that, no
Yeah, er and was certainly he, cos he was a
and er, you know
I always thought that you see when the, er Normans came and you had the
yeah
they could
and enter Scotland and a lot and then a lot came back from Scotland down to North and there was 
That's right 
relatively lush compared to London and Scottish
Oh yes, aye
the Normans and I think you've gotta 
I think there's lush  
and they've always had this complete divide, personalities apart from anything else
you know
Yeah
mm, oh think that's got something to do with it 
mm, yes, maybe exactly like
well you can be on another planet you know
Yeah
maybe North of Watford and you've had it couldn't you?
Yeah 
It must be worse for the Scots who
thank you
Nationalist, they blame Labour for that for taking their votes away, mm
they did very well in Scotland from what I've heard well 
 
did better than they thought they would
Yeah 
I think I despair of the society if voted come I'm gonna emigrate now
Hmm
it's just, this lot have voted for them again, I'm going  what are the red ones?
erm, do you think it would, the company provide a photocopier at their school, they have an
stuff on it and they have to have a pin number, so you put your pin number in and then it tells you exactly how many copies your pin number has copied
That's what I was trying to tell you about
It only costs a thousand pounds to get me 
it would be a lot easier
Yeah
if it was a machine and you can only use your own pin number you see to do everything
I have enough trouble trying to remember my Nat West one do ya mind?
You'd be putting in your Nat West one do, do, do, do, do 
 
sorry no money left Mrs  
or you might be tempted to put if it's just one, one to ten or something, you might be tempted to put the wrong number in 
Pass them round again so I can try one of the other ones this time 
The little ones this time
that was nice
this one falls out of your mouth
you just need a couple of days to
Dave and Julie have got this incredible new kitchen
Yeah
which, Julie still cooks everything straight from Marks and Spencers on it, I mean you only dirty the bowl, I mean you don't even dirty the microwave
Oh that's a good idea, fine by me
Mm 
Who's making your kitchen?
I've got my kitchen, it's in my drawing room


it's a Martin  kitchen
Martin 


goodness me he's a
They've expanded


If you, if you can visualize it's a long, as you're going in towards me, you pass
the hotel then you come to the shops, on the left hand side about the third shop along
Oh is that
it's in there
Mm, scrubbed pine?
It's, it's maple
Oh
it's solid maple, it's got no chipboard inside
oh the cupboards are brilliant it's just the fronts are so dated and the man in these reports in the house said erm, kitchen is satisfactory but it needs updating and it was only about seven years ago it was brand new, no, not seven, have we been in then, no eight, so nine or something, I know the fronts need sorting out.
Get new doors for that
I know, that's right, there's nothing wrong with the casings nothing
People who live diagonally up the hill when we moved into
and we could because the backs come together we could see the kitchen which was
it was quite a nice one
Mm
and everyone
has changed kitchen 
Has changed kitchen 
has taken it out
what a waste of money,sa sa this guy was saying who did, who did the kitchens said he said all the actual boxes are identical
and they're really good quality made and
you can tell it's, it's a
that was the fronts, I never liked them when I moved in
   

Elaine how many erm film, how many film slots are on this film?
Is it thirty six?
Cos we're onto number thirty one now
It's alright
so have you got another film or shall I
Yeah I've got another film
I was going to try and take a photograph of er lot of 'em so I'm gonna try and
yeah


maybe I could get two on a film, oh, eh, I don't need to use every single one do I?
I just need er, some that I think are on level five and some of them I think are there
all the children went there, I said it was kind of insulting wasn't it?
 
Oh yeah I felt insulted actually she's going
Oh it's a nice school
 

Self control
A couple of weeks ago
The day we were going out
Oh the day of the trip
going out to erm Derbyshire
oh is she still going on about it?
She, she really feels very vehement about it
about it, I think it's because Steven  lives across the road, do you not
  

you know the boy in her class er in  class that used to come here 
Yeah
er Mr  said to me
he said if you don't behave yourself lad you'll go straight back to the


it's funny erm
oh what a classic child, yeah  I've never, ever
My, my little room, my box 
Well erm, what do ya realize when you actually get your own badges and have a look at it, it's something like eighty five percent of it is taken up with
and there's nothing we can do about that.
Which was really what Len said originally wasn't it?
There wasn't enough money that's actually worth arguing about 
There's a little tiny bit to tinker with, but it's not  if we were to, we, we're canvassing at pressed about altering the length of the lunchtime break to break it down from an hour and a half and an hour and a quarter to an hour and a quarter to an hour which is being  we would save some money on not paying our  
Mm, well the government might get in our way now, that they've all elected back in
Mm
to er have an after club er school activities where
