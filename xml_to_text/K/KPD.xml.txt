Well  Mark  held er a meeting based on that document that was sent down  so, they had to cancel it because it was around er  thing they were voting on you see?
Mhm.
So, I phoned up Joe, and Joe says all the results weren't in because that's the kind of ordeal next week  er  er next Friday, tomorrow.
So  er er  for eight weeks.
The drivers definitely, well they're voting today, you see, well  have already accepted that, right?
So the drivers they vote today.
And then we'll need to wait and see how they go, but   Joe says, he says, well we've done this.
He said if we er, knock this back he said, and I don't know what we're gonna, they said they're gonna we do it in a month.
You see, but then  strike action.
He says, so what they do they do?
Are they just gonna strike, er strike?
He said everybody else is gonna accept that.
I said, Joe, I don't know.
And gotta, do  do you think that they were gonna accept it?
Well the factory's already voted against that.
with the fact that they've accepted it, possibly accepted, so we're only  with it.
I mean they've got the least  amount of people that are there are so we'll  either that or the end of the day see if it doesn't get banned, right?
Well, also, we'll need to have  meeting during the week.
And as Joe was saying, he said, all we do is  just go back to them and just try and say well look  you know  when you come to see us again do you  want to accept this  or regret it on the basis that you're going to strike, but all the other section in the company's accepted that.
Yeah.
You know, I mean, that's the realization of the whole thing.
And what do you think?
D'ya think
Well I mean, I told them at the time I was against the  of a sixteen month deal.
Mhm.
You know, that does nay impress me a lot.
Mm mm.
Quite happy about the seven percent.
I know.
But the deal

It's still sixteen, Joe  Joe said he did nay reckon he's going to get the management to shift  back to October
Aha.

You know?
So, maybe in the light of that they'll  have to attempt put it back to them again.
They'll accept that, I dunno.
Th they're voting today.
Right.
That one there.
Karen, you haven't eaten all of them.
Okay!
