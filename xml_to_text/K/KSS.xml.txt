We were laughing about it.
Cos I was telling them that we were sick of seeing the rain and that.
Yes.
You know cos the rain won't stop all day.
And I said to them I said I watched a film last night called Savage Sea.
And I said all the way through the film practically they were praying for rain.
Mm.
Right?
And there's us saying that we were sick of the rain.
So I says erm someone turned round and said, Oh should come here you can have some of ours.
And they were laughing.
They were laughing at it.
Oh.
Cos I turned round and said that.
Oh never seen that before.

Your daughter wants you.
She's in bathroom.
What's this?
She wants to know what that is.
It it's a test from now till next Friday all the conversations we have.
Why?
And you know when you have ordinary conversation when we're talking or anything
Why?
on a conversation.
It's for Oxford University to use.
If it's anything that's really personal and you don't want it taping you can erase it and you get a twenty five pound voucher next Friday.
You do it for Marks and Spencers for doing it.
Oh?
So is that yours?
No it belongs to the people Oxford University use the English language.
It's what English language be using now in nineteen ninety.
In the libraries and everything.
Oh.
So has that just been recording all that I've just all I've just said?
Yeah.
But it doesn't matter does it?
I mean you'd have a conversation anyway.
We talk in the house don't we?
Or we had 
Are you bothered?
Am I bothered?
Yes.
She's not saying
Depends what I'm talking about.
Well you've just talked about 
talking about.
the rain.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Well nothing but d'ya know what I mean it's sort of.
It's like at work erm Mark put two speakers one for listening and one for hearing
Yeah.
right?
You know in case one of the residence needs help or anything
Yeah.
during the night.
So he put one in the living room and he put one in the kitchen.
Yeah.
Now the the girls didn't know it was there and it's a good job that they weren't talking about him or talking about anybody.
Why?
Otherwise we'd have heard what they were saying.
Oh would they?
Now me I think that's sneaky.
D'ya know what I mean?
Well that isn't because 
Because 
if there's anything personal you can erase it.
But the more tapes I do and when I've she's coming for it eleven o'clock next Friday.
Oh when I do it for the week I'm gonna get a twenty five pound voucher for Marks and Spencers.
Well can we can we rewind that back and listen to it?
Yeah if you want yes.
Through headphones but you can't the tape's not full yet.
But it doesn't matter.
I think you'd better switch it off anyway hadn't you?
Cos nobody's gonna be having a conversation.
You're going in the garage now.
We're having a conversation now aren't you?
I'm going to the bedroom.
You're talking now.

We had a lady at Dixon  Mrs Brigadier .

What are we having for our tea?
I thought about it.
I've got no airs and graces.
No neither would I.

It's Newcastle not Newcastle.
But if they say Newcastle well alright but I wouldn't say anything .
Newcas Newcastle.

She'd just get a bash across the mouth if you kept picking me up.

I should say I've just as much  
When I was down there for the weekend I was speaking their accent.
Dad said.
Oh well your dad used to got to Scotland for the day and when he come back he was Scotch.
I know.
I mean he didn't need to go anywhere .
Erm when dad 
 
When he'd been home for a month.
Mm.
He was talking an American.
When dad phoned us when I was down there he says, When you come back you can get rid of that acce you can get back to your own accent .
You can drop your acc you can drop that accent.
Yeah but Arthur she only takes after you for that.
I can't help it though.
Wherever I 
Because you used to to that.
go I pick up the accent.
It was like when I went down to Liverpool.
I started speaking  
Oh but  Geordie.
Does she?
Yeah.
Don't she?
Oh aye.
But er  you don't need to say, Oh aye.
You say, Oh yes .
And they kept on saying I know I know I know I know.
And I kept
You was brought up to say, Oh yes.
Not, Oh aye.
Oh aye 
I don't pass myself to  tape recorder 
No.
I know you don't pass yourself out.
I think you're you're you're not passing yourself you're not speaking as you ought.
Because you would never dream of saying, Oh aye.
Oh aye.
I would.
Because Geordies say that don't they ?
Now June's father would say, Oh aye.
But it he'd he'd take it and forget it .
Oh aye the  
No.
And he could he would 
And he would say he would say waiter for water or water .
He would bet it.

Yeah well I say, Int he.
But it or if I were to be thinking I'd say, Isn't he.
Or  I might say, Isn't he.
talking to your dad some things if if er I don't agree on something I'll say, Nay Arthur  that's Aunty Emma isn't it ?

Yeah but they do.
They did did it with Michael.
They did did did it with Michael.
Did it with Michael.
The rent went up to thirty pounds a week.
You see  family.
You see we were on income support you see .
But she's family as well you see, so she becomes an independent, once she's married, she becomes an independent then they're e they expect you to when you're on income support.
I mean we're not being nasty 
 
But we can until we get a house, we can we can live with you can't we?
Oh yes.
Because I mean
Although they might ask where you're living mightn't they.
Yes but  
It's alright  
No.
It won't make any difference.
Yeah but I mean, even then they're not going to live with you  be nothing 
 
You can't help that.
Naturally it goes up.
If the  changing forms and
It's like Angela, by time they sort it out  being on income support,the Poll Tax  
married .
 
Cos I mean to say, even if it is  your father  
No  been a lot easier last time.
.
I know.
Well you don't
already agreed and there were two beds there.
Oh you've knocked me off now.
and when they're married they're married 
I'm going.
.
Well they  you won't be paying it.
So it doesn't make any difference.
Naturally they're not gonna come and .
When we got married we didn't go in another house.
But I used to pay a half to every bill.
Because there was there was dad and me and there was my mother and dad.
So we used to pay half to everything.
And now  er you're  like getting more than me so I so I want er I want so much more  rent and we used to pay half.
And I used to pay half of the gas bills, half of the electric bill.
And half to everything.
And .
Just half to all the bills.
I paid.
Then when Arthur came along, I said to me mother now there's a baby now, what now.
Then .
And even when me mother died, me dad still paid his half.
So that you have your  they're not so daft as to know that two people who are going to come and live even if Richard's away half the time.
You you you still .
And then listen .
When you've the the night you're mar the night You're gonna  you're gonna be married, you can stay here.
Because  about going to that place wherever you've decided to have it.
. If Richard's here he can go with you.
we're gonna be getting all his marbles  getting ready for going to the church.
.
. Wherever he is wherever he is.
Well who's gonna take it then Angela, your grandad can't take it.
You've got to go.
There'll be plenty of people here who can get it..
You can't  you can't rely on anybody.
There'd be a blooming puncture.
We're gonna have a we're gonna have a a thing that takes us to wherever you're having  
call a taxi.
On our  we'll ring our own taxi up if there's a problem with the  and we'll get that there.
So that it's done.
Cos grandad'll be all worked up and and  
 
and he's gonna be the best man anyway.
Well there you are, you can't go on like and have folk coming might not decide they're not coming.
it doesn't matter who's there and who isn't there.
As long as you and Angela's there and her dad's there and grandad's there.
And it doesn't matter about anybody else, because the wedding'll take place and  grandad has to sign the register, dad has to sign the register and the mother can sign and that's all that matters .
you can't even re re rely on anybody.
you'd have been relying on  to come and and collect you  Newcastle yesterday, and he ain't got a car.
No you can't rely on anybody
Well he hasn't got one then.
He's using it.
Well he hasn't  
No.
And if the lad said he couldn't borrow it.
I wouldn't want to  
No and I wouldn't wa I wouldn't depend on it.
If you depend on erm people or taxis, if they had a breakdown, well they'd send another one.
.
Don't they.
I know .
the Metro's running.
Well they was they were running this morning weren't they.
Aye they were.

Well it'll take 'em to the station.
replacement service.
Ere, which one goes to Newcastle ?
 
Erm .
But you don't know what time the 
 
Metro replacement is?
What time is the Metro.
It'll run the same time as the Metro.
You see that thing  on business to
Cos it goes direct from station 
Newcastle one time 
Ten past six.
Ten past six.

cake 
So if I was you Richard I wouldn't leave it till last minute, I  a bit sooner in case the buses are not running .
We're taking the cake.
We'll ring our own taxi firm and we'll ask for a .
she  well then you'll have to carry the mattress downstairs.
You've slept on a mattress before today, you've slept on a couch before today.

ridiculous for her to come and bring all that on a train when .
Yes it's absolutely ridiculous for you to bring, but you're not running the car.
And they might not want to do it.
They might not want to do it .
 
You can't rely on people.
I can't see Auntie saying no, but I don't think .
So  .
I mean it's alright
I mean she'd have to  
we've gone through it, we've had a car and we know.
And if you take every chance of 
Right.
putting somebody else out, you don't like to .
It'll take all the  for them to come from where they're coming from .

And I said, Why what have I done.
She said, well, she said, I asked you to take four people home and you said, No I'm sorry.
She said, and I didn't expect you to say that.
So I said, well  did you stop to kn know we are fourteen miles.
We've to go back fourteen miles, we've come fourteen and we've to go back fourteen miles.
And it took  all this time to get here.
And we got here safe and we was thankful for that.
And then we wer found out instead of sitting and listening we had to do the service.
So I said, we done all that, and then we'd to go back fourteen miles.

I said, I was thankful that he got here safe and I can't drive.
 
And I was thankful that he was coming back alright.
See.
Wait a minute while I finish.
And I said er but I'm not unkind at all.
I said, it hurt the captain because we've been used to you know, ferrying everybody about, and I said, don't d say that people are unkind because they they're not taking you and carrying you about.
Oh she says, well I'm sorry Mr , I never thought about it like that, you see.
It's the easiest thing in the world you see as she says 
 
Well I just to well he'd done it before  And I said to them, Oh captain'll take you.
And then she said, when you said, well you wo they won't, I said, everyone knows because she said, by the time we has taken those people home, it would have been dark.
I said and and captain can't drive in the dark.
So what we would have been  I mean it weren't just at the bottom of the street.
And she said, oh well I am sorry Mrs , she said, I never thought about that.
She said, it is the easiest thing in the world, she said, to just say, Oh well they'll take you.
And when you think about it, it is.
Because you're using Well your dad wouldn't mind.
Bertie might, he might say, Well  
Yeah I mean I I did say I'm not sure.

yeah it's not an actual cash transaction
oh
all they do is diddle some keys and it goes off to T S B and then it goes into your account, that's the way it's supposed to work 
they have been excited for a bit of money and end up with nowt, sending you letters
that's it 
look's like that an all, I want to know if it's going in weekly or monthly

it wants washing that pan anyway
it doesn't  it's washed 
I tell you what you'll give 'em till next Tuesday and if it don't come by then you still, you can just cancel it save up 
is that all the  is that all they do?
mm
save up and buy it, it won't cost
I know, I mean when you think about it, what is it you'll have, a tape deck, amplifier, oh you have to 
mm
tape deck, amplifier and your  you're not bothered about the tuner
no 
no 
I never use that one, so
so three amp, amplifier I can get for about
there it is 
a hundred and fifty 
how much?
what 
amplifier, Pioneer
 
yeah a hundred and fifty 
this is a hundred and fifty pounds 
equalizer you can get one for a hundred and thirty, that's two seventy
eighty nine was the equalizer 
 
yeah, but you're talking Pioneer here 
yeah 
tape deck, well it varies, you can get one, a double one for a hundred and fifty
more, or a hundred and twenty nine
so your total was  about four thir about four fifty roughly 
what we've got in here is Goodmans, Crown, Akai and Sharp
but only one Sharp
Sharp is a midi compact disc player  them's are
aye 
said they'll call me
mm
granddad's doing it  Angela said you're using your mum and dads address so we can put the banns in here with it
yeah I know
only your mother wasn't sure  she asked me on the phone
oh
said yeah, Richard is using your address to put the banns in here with Angela
a month now, used 
aye 
to be three weeks, gotta putta your banns in for a month 
you can put them in two days before but you need a special licence, which is seventy eight pounds, it's a bit of useless information really 
what are them like? banns  banns
multiplication
who to?
the registrar office
they go in a glass case at the registrar office in a you know a display, a notice board 
fella, fella's don't have to do it 
aye
and that's put on and if, we say for argument sake that er she was married, we know she's not, but she could be and her banns are in and her husband gets wind that she's getting married again, you know, so he goes into the registrar office has a look, and  she's already married to me and this is what it's for
this is what it's  
oh I didn't know about that.
I'm surprised dad you hadn't bought the pioneer system
It's too expensive
I dunno you're paying that much out, four hundred quid near or something aren't ya?
three hundred and summat
three hundred and seventy 
three hundred and seventy two I think it is
three hundred and seventy nine
it's that, I don't want the full system anyway, I only want 
are them separate?
er mini hifi's
 
I don't know whether they're separate or er 
 

you like your separates don't ya?
your talking seven hundred and odd quid
four, nine, nine
no, with a C D I think it's seven hundred and odd quid in it?
dunno, I'm just trying to find out what you want here 
was it the  you rang up?
yeah
God it's ridiculous in it?
nine fifty a head
four, nine, nine, nine, nine 
nine pound fifty a head
I mean you can get a dearer one a multiple 
yeah 
compact seven, seven or
nine pound fifty a head 
twin compact disc seven, two, eight and there's a twin compact disc as well 
that's all inclusive
that's everything
that is your,play semi automatic record deck
which I don't want
well it's part of it really
yeah
I mean that comes off it, I can see that much, I just thought it was good anyway 
yeah 
sell it to Richard couldn't you?
huh
twins er set decks, tape to tape record, high speed dubbing and up two hours continuous playing
that's high speed dubbing, twin auto tape  cassette decks, got one and  to play back
she says
long medium, F M stereo waveband, digital tuner,thi , thirty six pre stations
yeah, which I don't want anyway
five band stereo graphic deviser with spectrum analyzer
it's a lovely little lady
also a multi synchrony editing system from recording from compact disc, twin compact disc player with twenty four tracks from random memory, three way speaker system, headphones and auxil , auxiliary  full functional remote control
mm
except turn table
he said oh don't want speakers cos I've got them there
no I know, but I mean  
 
I don't want a turntable, I'm not bothered about it
yeah, but five hundred quid, a couple of hundred more 
yeah I know 
one seventy more and you get a twin play compact disc player from it 
oh aye I know what you're saying
you get the tuner, you get the equaliser and you get the, okay you don't want the record deck, but you could always sell the record deck to buy new speakers
oh yeah, I suppose, I suppose
so Richard he couldn't, he'll probably buy the Pioneer speakers
mm
and the deck, so you make what say, a hundred quid there, cos brand new speakers and a brand new record deck  so you'd only be paying four hundred quid for it
mm
which is only about, how much?
dad Karen say, she's still got her
she's asked Karen to be a bridesmaid 
a bridesmaid she said she's still got her bridesmaid, bridesmaid dress 
at least she'll come smart 
has she?, oh well, there you are then 
that she wore for her mum's, it's peach 
you don't want it peach anyway 
it doesn't matter you can have peach can't she?
everyone has peach
so
one sixty, one sixty  two fifty say
she's only a little doll
aye
three eighty possibly for them
mm
you might as well say three eighty, it's a hundred and twenty quid more and you could sell the speakers and the deck
mm
I'd rather have that then I tell you
is Richard's sister wearing a bridesmaid dress?
yeah, of course she
I thought you said they can't
Yeah, travel line, and I says to her I said I'm looking at this V F M bus timetable I says the five two, one I said it goes down ?
Street, I said is that, is that alright, you know sort of thing I said would I, she said yes she said it does, she said it, it runs the same route as the five, two, seven, but it runs early then it becomes five, two, seven, the five, two, ones still on, like a two seven and a two one, two seven, two one and there were 
 
yeah
That's side B now and then it'll be full 
yes that's side B, it's not going any where
on three I pressed it in
aye it is, yes 
oh dear  I suppose really if you want to eat something I'll get it in
Oh yeah
don't have any question about that
yeah
but erm
I'm the same with Arthur 
Sunday night we listen to the er Messiah, I was going to tape it and I thought no I don't, I doubt if this tape would  this machine
what on this?
on this
aye
so I erm, we watched it, anyhow Monday I went into er Smiths and asked them if it was on tape
mm
she said no it's not, not, I doubt it, by now she said I don't know whether it will take it, whether the, the, you know the  or not
what's that?
Messiah
Handels Messiah?
yeah
it's on record in't it?
oh aye
oh it's on ta it's on video, yeah it's on video
is he?
but not that, because that's 
no 
it's on the 
oh
er, now she said the only one we had, in fact she said the only one that's listing is the one that was done in the Abbey, Westminster Abbey, with the Westminster choir and the London Philharmonic in nineteen eighty two
oh
she said and that's the only one that listed
our Angela's after that song in the South in't she?
aye
is that on video?
yeah
it was good,
when were that?
er  two
B B C two
B B C two
aye  I thought we watched on Sunday, what did we watch on Sunday?
dunno
oh me wrestle mania was on
me and Angela watched films
I watch me wrestler mania from ten o'clock till one 
how many more different strokes have you to do for your map?
oh there's only two on there
no, but where's the other one?,
I thought there was one on last night
they're on every night Friday, er, erm, er Monday to Friday five o'clock 
how come you forgot?
I forgot to set it, I forget, did forget about 'em
you see sometimes before that, a  today and they were perfect
oh aye
not a flaw on them
lend you the tapes
well I'm wondering whether it's one or two of the tapes, I just can't sort out which they are somehow 
what tapes are they?, what's that one?what make?, it's gotta name on it
what the machine?
no the tape 
no the tape 
er, I tell you what we seem to be having difficulties with
yes, those are the ones that seems to be the
I bought some new tapes four hours off the market, two fifty each, and one of them's dead faulty in't it?
oh aye yeah
well I says I'm 
 
not getting no more
well that's true
it'll go so far and then it just switches off
mm
I can't really see that being the tape itself
mm, makes you wonder that if you shouldn't pay the dearer price and get the proper decent tapes 
get decent tapes, yeah 
don't even, get the cheaper ones, like we had no trouble with the Memorex did we?
no
they were dearer, but we had no trouble with them
but then again we've not  
with that them four with have with them four hour
oh them four hour yeah, well they're lousy quality with them 
well they were two fifty each
two fifty each
yeah, I wouldn't call that cheap  oh there was summat on t'other day, Sunday, and I told him and he forgot about it didn't he?,
The Bluebird
oh yes
forget didn't he?
got satellite haven't ya?
yeah, anyway I think it's on again on the fifteenth, so I've written it down so I don't forget because he'll forget
oh
I says to him you could of taped that for your mum, I says she'll like that, he says I forgot, ee I says you tell me I'm going senile 
but it always seems to be something we want special, either a silly little comedy and things like that they were perfect, but anything we really want, it always seems to stop
 

as I've taped something
mm
as I've taped something, cos it's spat out ain't it?
yes I well er 
I tell you what it was, it was Samsung, if you've a little bit of tape and you end at beginning and you want it, well say you wanted to tape to test a little bit say off telly or  
 
right, you did that much and then you re-wound it back to the beginning then, it's stubborn that  it won't do it, it will not re-wind
yeah
at what?
at the beginning I mean
at the beginning?
yeah
well that's the same
now if I tape for about an hour and a half or an hour and then rewind it, it'll go
mm
but it will not do a little bit
no, er
ooh it's annoying
now that tape that's in now, tt, there's a little bit at the front of that and it's been on, oh it must of been on a fortnight and it doesn't matter what you record
it's still there
it's still there 
it's same with a Samsung, I end up sometimes putting it in the Toshiba one, to re-wind it back, but I've had some funny tapes I have just lately, it's the tape that won't re-wind, because how I've noticed been the tape like, cos I've put it in the Toshiba and re-wound, but it wouldn't even re-wind in the Toshiba, so Arthur says well he says that's the tapes
yeah
I think I'm gonna go back to Memorex tapes again that I had, had er, never 
oh, we've had no trouble with the Hitachi
no, no we haven't had much, no, no we haven't had trouble with the Hitachi, just the machine itself actually 
yeah 
and er, then we had a bit, but er everything in the bottom drawer there, those are all playing alright
yes
we're just, we're just running on five tapes I think, well only four because one of them are   oh well, let's go upstairs again
oh that's where I'm going  shall I nip up before you?
er be quick
can you manage to get up?
oh yes I think I can pull myself up  
Well fetch it in here, that's it
What, just there?
pardon?
your man said 
aye
we've got nothing to hide have we mum?
what
about that other business
put it down there
and it, and it doesn't go anywhere anyway cos they'd of
no, but that stops anybody else 
it's alright there 
who won't be getting
it's sliding
what they're getting 
no, no 
they don't tell you what they're getting do they?
oh no
what I'm saying to you now is, I was saying to Arthur, the, the petrol money that we used to put in for petrol, it cost us five pound a week in the winter, but in the summer it cost us eight pound a week sometimes ten
yeah
but five pound on putting that away definitely, every week, as it's all paid petrol money, so now I've got eighty pound, eighty pound is in me, me, one of me purses and that is, it has on, there again, I mean everything, not a lot,if you'd to go in you'd see, it'd have a, it'd have erm petrol money, it's eighty pound, now I'm saving that so by the time aunty Mary comes I shall have probably a hundred pounds in that 
so she is coming
well she said she, she wants to come and she'd like to come, but it'll be end of June, because she's going to some er Methodist day out somewhere, I don't 
mm, mm 
know where they've planned owt to go, and er, so she said it'll get end of June or even July 
is she , is she coming by train?, cos she told us it was better by train 
well I suppose she will, I don't 
oh 
know nothing after that, but anyway I said it will, I'm putting this away so I'll have a hundred pound then and if she doesn't come I says I'll have a hundred pound for  
yeah, yeah 
now if I want to go down to the sea front well I'll shall get a taxi and, and shan't be worrying where me next meals coming from because I've saved it, so, so that's, that's no worry, I was saying to Arthur if we went to Butlins well it would take all we had, because it, we couldn't go to Butlins under three hundred pounds for two of us, we couldn't go anywhere else, if we go to Blackpool, our, our  said to, to, to dad, I, I would like to pop to, er I don't think we will do because, er, the hassle for your dad, but er, I'd like to go and see aunty Annie, but I don't want to go to Nelson to do it
no
because it'd mean I'd have to go to bank of   and, and this borough and  
well I said I wouldn't mind spending a week at aunty Mary's me for a week 
and we couldn't do that well you're alright because she gi 
but we're not we can't go, Angela can't get herself up, if she come here, who's gonna look after Sparkie? see what I mean 
that's no excuse I mean Sparkie I'd come here, all the time, well Iris has a  I mean 
well don't you think your mum I'd have it?
why do you think that?
I don't know him 
oh don't be so daft, I had him er over a year 
he's a little, aye I know but he's , yeah I know but it wasn't for a week was it?
he's, it wasn't a minute struggle, you, you kept harping on all week he's in, in the  
he jumps in the window mum and 
well you get Shane he's a badden 
he jumps in the window  
is he
he's on his best behaviour  
he's, he's awful but, er never made  more bother with, some kids down there by the  erm 
so honestly mum if we I mean if we 
but  
wanted a week somewhere would you have him for us with Angela?
of course we would wouldn't we  ?
who?
we'd give you the money for his food and that little Sparkie 
Angela and er Angela and I'll tell you what she can come anytime she wants 
little Sparkie 
yeah, of course 
and I mean you can get about when you, when you go but we can't so it's no good, if we put a bed in our spare room  
I said I'd like a break, spend a week with aunty Mary or summat in that flat, driving me 
I know
I mean I could say well like Elsie I could say ooh well I mean she comes, she leaves him I mean nine o'clock in the morning 
to sign on 
and she doesn't get home until half past, six  it's 
I know 
all day by yourself, well I couldn't do that with your dad
no
well, like I'd say I'd go down to post office, I say no I'll go with ya, it was raining last Thursday, I said no I'll go with ya, so I said I'll wait and see if it'll, it'll be fine, but he's not like that he's an old, I wouldn't, well
well we were only talking about 
I wouldn't dare leave him by himself I wouldn't think of leaving your dad by himself, going out gadding about
we were only thinking about it this morning and I says I wouldn't mind a break, you know, like, cos, I mean aunty Mary's always inviting us, and, and we were talking about the cat 
I mean there's, there's nowt no harm if, if, if you went to aunty Mary's and she definitely gave a date, a date to come, it would be nice if you went and come back 
fetch her back, mm 
come back with her, come back with her
yeah, yeah
oh
I mean er
you know, so to go before hand and fetch her here back with us 
what I'm saying is with Arthur says get yourself four hundred pound  go to aunty Mary's, but you don't want to go to aunty Mary's do ya?, you'd rather her come here
I'd rather she come here
mm
I've got 
I mean 
to the stage now where I don't want to run about
no
I mean if, he, it's alright your dad doesn't moan
mm
and you know that, I mean your dad 
well I says 
plenty of  
to Arthur I want a change from that flat I'm sick of looking at four walls 
the what?
I like the new  single decker
well when you're only young I mean  
I like them 
that's it 
they are comfortable
yeah
you're only young people
I'm forty eight, oh dear
 
and it's like I said mum it's not because I don't trust Angela
you mean the blue ones
I'm worried
aye, yes that's right 
she cannae get herself up in the morning if there's nobody there, can she?
well I don't know, she got herself up this morning
yeah, I know, but, you, you know what she's like 
there's no need for her to be on her own, I mean there's a bus stop right at door
that's what I said 
that's what we said 
I says if she went up to your mum and dad, I said the eighteen drops her right, you know, the stop 
mm  we'll have to see anyway
plus, plus Sparkie I'll be alright with Angela
have you talked about this with her?
I'd give it a good hiding if it didn't behave 
mm

I don't know you were in here and I were in there, in your sitting room, she were happy to make tea, she were right working 
she were, she were helping to make tea and, I don't know how she, how it came, but she said  granddad, I thought oh something's coming now  I says what?, she said if I came to stay with you, she said after Richard's you know sale, if I came to stay with you for  at the weekend  shall I have to go in that
shall I have to go in that spare room?
mm
well I said that's up to you, but I said if you want a bed back in our room, you'll have to fetch it I'm not  and yet she sleeps on her own at your house doesn't she?
mm
yeah
she doesn't like it though
no, she doesn't like 
no

quite when er 
she'll have to get used to it 
when Richard was staying she went in middle of us and she was, she were a lot more comfortable, than what she is when she's in her own room 
the thing with them, a bed with them, she'll not come in now, and never come, no reason why not, cos I know she smokes so what does she do that we haven't to know, so I says oh I says this bed isn't gonna keep being here and no An no Angela in it 
no 
so I says it's going, now as far as the, er, what they call it that fella that come to did that job 
do  
mm?
as far as I  
 
I wouldn't say it was any better, I don't know whether it is or not, but I've just done one good thing, it's got the bed shifted
yeah
because he couldn't get to there you see so I said well it'll have to go now, well we've got it shifted and it's thrown away and, and that's the end of that, so I says now when she does decide to come and she wants to be in here, well I said she'll just have to carry a mattress in, and that'll be alright just for her to sleep on
aye, yeah 
only there won't be a bed, but I said if she does, then she'll have to remember when she goes back home to put it back, cos I'm not lugging beds about
no 
she'll have to get somebody to help her to carry it back, that's all I said 
no I said we don't do that
no
because we've condensation
oh
so he said this one I'll have to be done
mm
anyhow he looked all around and, very nice lad, er and then he came, he said I had to  for you 
by the way if we ever did do that stay with aunty Mary, right, then she came back with us
yeah 
and Angela happens to be sleeping over as she does at her job
yeah
where would she get the five, two, one from?,
I mean she couldn't get a, on a Sunday, she'll have to have a taxi won't she?

how'd ya mean if she's, she's sleeping over? if she was sleeping over 
if she was sleeping up here and she was sleeping over in home, you know how she'll, at weekends, what she calls sleeping over

.
No but I mean it's it's no better than the seaside I mean .
cheaper.
Well no but I do I shouldn't say 
.
certainly not at this time of the year.
If they want to be on their own, they could go book a chalet down on  beach.
Yeah that's an idea  
 
But I mean, the Isle of Wight if they went straight after the reception they wouldn't they wouldn't get there till Sunday .
You can't  think about they don't want to be on a station  come here in Newcastle.
.
but they have to be told.

And I said you want a I said you want an usher.
And he looked at me gormless
I know.
and Angela said, an usher's to tell people where to sit.
And I said you want a groomsman.
And that hasn't been talked about yet.
What's a groomsman.
I d well he didn't tell, what's a groomsman, but his face did.
Cos he didn't know.
I said,people that knock at the door and say, the taxi's ready  the taxi man doesn't come and do it.
Ooh.
I said, Richard we're not pushing and nosing but we want  doing right.

I thought you'd mentioned that to him Arthur.

No problem.
to keep the children quiet.
Well if there's no usher, I shall do it meself.
Yeah you could do that mum couldn't you.
I can't be doing groomsman.
Oh no.
You might have to take over  last minute.
.
Well no it can't  Angela ask him somebody ask him, he can't just arrive and start doing things.
It's all got to be done methodically and  
be too nervous .
Mm?
He'll be too nervous.
There's nowt nervous on knocking on somebody's door and saying I Are you ready?
Where's the nervo er well ..
Oh no  he knows and that he's still shy mum.

Usually usually what they do, they have one taxi for the bridegroom's people and one for the bride's people.
Right.
That's all it and  
Right, so many journeys.
And er y you sort of make your list of who has to go and where they've to come from, take it into the office, and they organize it.

And this were what would it be, about twenty to seven.

Oh yeah, she says, but erm w w 
I've no sympathy.
we're back friends.
I says, Aye, I says, well you needn't bother fetching her to our house.
to do with you.
Aye, she says

Well she can't be much cop if she'd open her legs to a first date to a Dutch s sailor.
That's all I've got to say.
So anyway she er she got in the house and she never went out again  
Did she not go then?
No.
Oh well I said to her  
She said she'll see you tonight at .
I said to her, Angela I said, don't you pushing your nose in  asking you to adopt it.
And you'll be saying yeah.
No I mean she knows right from wrong she's no business to  have one there has she.

And she were on her about  and sailors and what have you and I thought, aye, I'll know where you'll end up lady and she has.
I've no sympathy.

No.
No sympathy for anybody like that, they know what they're doing.
They're not much cop when they can open their legs like that.
And I really got angry with our Angela.
I said, I don't know what you're bothering for.

Well please yourself  
that's vicarious that's it is 
Yeah .
But you see, as I I said to her I said, no Angela it's alright is that I said, but I said 
No we tried to talk her out of.
she had no business to do it, she knew what she were doing and they had no business to do it.
It's like abortion.
Nobody  saying oh what have I to do if I want an abortion.
You don't have to have an abortion, there shouldn't be one there to have an abortion for should there.
No.
No.
Anyway.
get on her high horse over abortion.
Oh aye.
I mean be thankful she's not like that.
I don't like abortions but to me it depends  on the circumstances.
Like an ordinary married woman or something like that, if it's a matter of life and death.
No  
Cos there are cases aren't there where a 
like that  and the think they're being clever.
