Ooh.
Here you are then.
Here you are.
Mm yummy.
Mm.
What are you saying eh?
What are you saying?
Mm?
Their electric bill was  sky high.
I didn't .
It was on  
Well it might have been the the gas bill because er you know what she's like with the central heating.
Yeah.
Both.
Yeah.
I think he used to pay all the 
Yeah, I think he did.
Out of the business.
through the business.
Yeah.
And now, now they've come to realize that he's only on a wage, he's on a bloody good wage and all.
Mm yeah.
Right?
And they have grandad's money.
That buys all the bloody food.
Well it's his pension  isn't it?
Yeah.
All he lives on is his personal pension.
What, from the gas board?
Yeah.
That's what he lives on.
And if he ever wants to buy anything
Yeah.
Mm.
So  basically I reckon they're gonna be in the shit.
Because er  no mum was saying er  they should be out enjoying theirselves, not having to stay in paying all this.
Well I mean it's  their decision wasn't it?
Yeah.
They 
Now they've come to realize what it's like.
Well I know she had to pay her poll tax didn't she?
Down at 
Yeah.
Barnet.
Yeah that was a month's wages, nearly.
Well a good part of it anyway.
She can't clear much money.
I reckon she must get home, take home about eighty quid a week or something.
About hundred quid a week.
Yeah well no that's not bad money for a woman
Yeah.
working er what she's doing.
Yeah.
Just started and all.
Not very good wages are they?
No I know.
In there.
Poor wages.
Poor payers I mean.
Yeah.
Oh well they'll just have to  steady down won't they?
And I can see it in a year  I I'll give it, give dad er  about eighteen months 
Yeah.
and he'll be wanting to leave  Avenue Panels 
Yeah.
It'll come too much.
Then he'll wanna form a partnership.
Well you're not gonna  I don't think, no
No.
No I wouldn't 
No.
I'm happy as I am.
No cos 
I'll have to see what it's like down the road.
If it's got room for expansion which I'm hoping  then, I would say yeah because dad's got a good reputation.
Yeah but what could he do?
I mean what's he gonna be like in a  couple of years time?
He might say oh he 
Don't know.
But he's not bad at spraying.
He's a good sprayer.
Oh but that's the whole reason he stopped, because he couldn't 
That's right.
cope with it.
The only thing the old man could do was spray.
He couldn't  every time he undid bolts like  and if they were tight, he couldn't do them.
Cos you've got to   and he can't use his fingers and if he has to  it  right?
And ea each knock  he used, used to be in agony.
Like if he was hitting something and he accidentally hit his ha his thumb or his finger  he used to be in agony for  I mean it used to hurt him for the rest of the day.
Mm.
You know?
Mm.
Whereas if I hit me hand  you know, okay it hurts but it's gone in five minutes.
If I keep, keep hitting it like I did the other day when my brother was there  me thumb and that, oh boy!
I mean it was 
Yeah.
swollen.
Yeah.
I remember that.
You showed it me.
Yeah.
That's cos I kept hitting it, bloody .
But I could, I can hack the pain.
Yeah.
And that's the difference you see, it was gone  day but dad's is not.
If he'd have kept hitting it like I h I hit mine  no way.
Yeah I know.
He's  I mean he, he just wouldn't be able to er contribute enough.
I don't think.
He wouldn't be able to  you know, okay he'd probably potter about on a restoration job but I mean that's not 
They're good payers, restoration jobs.
Well yeah, but I mean it's not providing half the business is it?
Res restoration job you're talking er  if you actually work on a vehicle a week, talking five hundred quid a week.
Yeah.
So I mean I I just couldn't 
I mean that's two grand a month.
see him being able to do the work.
No but then you've gotta guarantee that you've got restoration jobs.
That's it.
Yeah.
They've got to be guaranteed work like one after the other.
Think  they're just gonna have to cut back.
Oh yeah.
They probably will do cos  
I mean your mum'd save a lot of money if she found a l job locally where she didn't have to travel.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Go on the bus.
I mean it must, well she must spend ten quid a week on bus fares.
Oh easily.
Easily I'd say.
Yeah.
But she's got all that way to walk.
That's why she ought to learn to drive.
If she drove  she'd save money that way.
Okay you've got to fork out  insurance and er  petrol.
It'd be a lot cheaper.
But  in that sense she can use the car on her own.
She can go out shopping.
Well she could take the .
Dad doesn't use it does he?
That's it yeah, the useless bloody thing.
Can you imagine him letting her use it?
He'd have a fit.
You'd love  's motor.
His  granny Brilliant.
What?
John  's granny.
Yeah.
Oh, top of the range weren't it?
Oh!
Did you phone up that garage?
Yeah.
Yeah?
It's er  four speed gearbox.
It's got a broken er ignition  it's broken in two.
But they imagine that would be er replaced.
Erm  dunno what the mileage is like.
Rust's supposed to be not too bad.
Er  that's about it really.
Mm.
He didn't know much about it.
The bloke I spoke to.
Really?
Must be a fairly new garage cos I've never heard of them before.
I've never seen them advertised before.
No I haven't.
I dunno.
Er I'll go and do this stuff and er
You gonna pop down the shop for me then?
Yeah.
Yeah I'll take  
Do you want dumplings?
Yeah, can do.
You've got steak and kidney.
Ugh.
Oh great!

That bill.
Oh we've got a bill you see.

Don't you?
Bags of rubbish from the ga there weren't no bags of rubbish in the garden.
No there wasn't.
No I know.
I think, well we'll hang on to it and then they can send us a reminder can't they?
Yeah.
It's normally thirty days.
It doesn't say anything on there.
No they don't.
That's what I was looking at.

No.
They're tricky bastards, they really are.
I don't like them.
The council are a nuisance.
They are really.

But  I said no, cos we don't it yet.
I said we want it behind the shed.
But whether they've actually put it behind the shed or what I don't know.
Well I hope they have.
I'd better go and have a look.
Well that's where you told me to tell him to put it, behind the shed.
I said the back of the shed.
At the back?
The other side, not behind.
No  yeah you said the back.

You shouldn't take him out there.
He's alright, only for a quick second.
Alright.

So she didn't have to cook.
Ah they would have had to wash up the plates and the knives and forks.
But she's just one of those women who don't like leaving stuff around, you know what I mean?
Once they've had something they've gotta do it before they go, can you believe.
She's a right pain in the arse at times, me mum.
That's why they don't go anywhere you see.

So I've put the
in, in his baby walk and he's sort of 
he were ever so good and I was told about all these
and he told me about Thomas the Tank engine, everywhere we went
Ah
absolutely crazed on Thomas the Tank
really?
Cos then it's something that's done him good and it's learnt him to talk cos he's had Thomas erm
yeah
without putting it on.
Oh, well perhaps we'll get him some of Thomas the Tank for his birthday then, if we've forgotten it, biscuit 
Did you go swimming on Thursday?

Nearly
I said to her did they
in there mind, I've bought you some chicken portions so when you're here next week you've got chicken portions 
You're a happy little soul.
Has he lost a bit of weight?
Yeah, I have, of course he didn't really eat last week, especially
really for him, ain't you?
In fact it'll help him chest wise won't it?
Yeah, he's a lot better, you can't hear it now.
Yeah, we've found something he likes for breakfast  it's called Quakerwake, it's erm porridge with little bits of food in it
Oh lovely.
he eats a big bowlful.
It's good for him.
He likes that.
What you doing, cutting down a bit on his milk?
Yeah, I do him cows milk during the day, he has er two bottles of that cows milk and then he has a, a big bottle of formula milk at night, so 
I brought him it, erm, a lunch box with a flask in, I said, look this flask you suck it like a straw, so get him to take that everywhere with him cos then he can have that, then he, cos you said you wanted to get him off the bottles, cos you put the straw in that
Yeah
yeah
time they've been round the floor and picked up again they're not that good are they?
No cos the health visitor, she, cos I asked her about sterilizing, and, and she said with all teats they should be sterilized no matter what age they are
Mm
so, they're so, they've got all nooks and crannies in them, you can get all sorts in them
yeah 
apparently
it's only sixty P I think
it was Thomas the Tank, all Thomas books and you can get crayons to do with it
Yeah
so he had that out, he just crayoning a bit now
Oh is he?
Mm
That's good
 

I don't know whether I want
 

Except I
Let's zip your suit up dear
And when we spend
so I thought as soon as I can get to see her I'll see if she'll give Jim my, I thought an aran cardigan
Mm
cardigan
mm, I've got mum a nice cardigan
and Lucy said it fits him lovely, but she was saving all the blue clothes
Amy's three tomorrow, so she'll give them to her tomorrow, she
 

so had the party in
So what's that
 

I say to Lee didn't you, you take on having her
 

it's alright when it's your own at the time because well it's, it's different, when there's another one there, I mean it, it wears you out  so 
Thank you for them, thank you for
Ooh you are funny  you are funny, yeah.
Couldn't believe any difference of him from Christmas when he didn't say anything
to know
to know, we don't say, had to talk to him through the Christmas presents it was lovely.
I wonder if, if that
I'd put that out with them two tapes and take to Julie to put them on a big tape for you.
Pat  rung up and wanted me to fetch the dressing table on Tuesday night I said yeah alright I'll do Wednes but I forgot I was going out with the girls Wednesday so I went out Tuesday and she wouldn't let me have it, cos Tuesdays they're not working in the kitchen 
Really?
Oh god 
wouldn't take her five minutes, so she sat
so I thought, I can help you lift them outside, no Tuesday night is my night in the kitchen.
I only got inside the front door cos it's Tuesday night her night in the kitchen, so I went back home and he didn't half swear at me, he said you bloody well go again you want your head tested, I could have cried I thought oh well cos I didn't feel like rushing around
I was telling them
so she said I said to her how much the old front
so I said put it down me
she stuck it outside
Well, you, oh
yeah but, you know, it's
and that a week before it happened, what's happened to her, cos she don't hear from her, and she said you know, I, it's been twenty five years since my mum died Anne, she said and if I didn't make a life,
would have come to me
No
she said and now I'm finishing school I still need them sometimes for a meal and then I'm going out in the W R V S shop, something like that in the chain,
yeah
then you don't need people
why nobody's going to buy
Sometimes you felt like saying 
Yeah , yeah, well not if you ask, I mean if you ask somebody to come and help you 
I think it would have took us
oh no, no,
and don't come too early she said 
She's really gone funny ain't she?
She is unsettled.
I think if she hadn't gone away at Christmas she would have gone round the bend
would have been somebody a counsellor or something.
I mean he fancied having a day off to the anniversary of them dying, she had a day off then like she did at Christmas 
and then, then a different one dies,
really think one of that didn't she?
Really
I mean she had plenty of warning it happening to her
yeah
couldn't tell Pat
Yeah 
yeah I mean, she weren't that good with her when she was alive
No
I think it's guilty, that's what that is
Yeah, that's it
Yeah.
There's er, there's an organisation with erm, er voluntary, where they go and they talk to her
Cruse
Cruse, yeah Mrs  went to
and then she began to open up didn't she?
Yeah 
But you see she ain't a person you could say that to Ida is she?
No 
I mean when, when, when she was home she could have spent the evening with us when all the children were there and joined in but she wouldn't, she cleared out back and that's how Julie heard
Yeah, yeah.
Well if she gets funny again just turn around and say Pat well I think you need some help.
I think Grace and
come in that day and she sat up the table with the boys and had a dish of
she said, I've got Jack's and mine dinner cooking she said we've got 'tatoe's with crust round today
Oh yeah 
 
now I'm having time with her.
I mean she loves it with the kids
Yeah 
I found a frame now I ain't got
and I've got a frame big enough for Joseph
Oh yeah
shame, I still have a frame
No, I daren't tell her
Are you busy?
It is a lovely ball, are you busy?
Ah are you busy?
Yeah, I think you are,
had a stick of rock, yeah, aren't you lucky.
Don't forget April the first that's Uncle Tom's birthday, I knew that one, I never thought to say that, but
No, I, I knew it was some time but I just  I remembered Louise's birthday because Louise's birthday was the Friday the thirteenth
And was she two?
No Louise she was, oh no two, six 
And how is she?
She's alright yeah, well I, I bought her a book but it's one of these, it's like a talking book a Disney one, it's got like a keyboard down the side and you press certain pads and it makes a noise and I thought oh rather than just getting an ordinary book, I thought that would be quite good
Yeah
Yeah, but it's erm
Did she have a party or anything?
No, no 
Different what a party makes 
There there's a good boy 
I was pleased that Sarah was trying to
like that in a way because I think my lens you know, know what we're going through
don't she?
Yeah
She
you couldn't hold a conversation she said with her,
said yes or no, of course that baffled Lynsey, cos Lynsey and Pat, you know they got talkative at first Pat told me 
Bloody cheek, she 
on the phone cos we only speak once a week, well I don't think
and that, so 
Charles is very much like that on the phone, you can't get a conversation out of him
Well it's in the
it's when you go in there, you spend awful lot of funds sort of thing that's how much you feel 
Yeah , yeah, you know used to phone up and you used to think well what have you phoned up for,cos you end up talking 
Yeah 
and talking
and she said if they didn't phone
they would never know they were alive, oh well.
Oh
One thing she won't be remembered for
no it's not
 

Well at least we say hello
We'd better get, what some of the old dears are up to 
Oh yeah, I'll go and see what she's doing 
Playing with the bairn
Yeah he's
oh when I phoned up you,
Got a phone, you going to play with your own phone
He likes that one nan, what if you, pick up the phone and dial and start talking to somebody he sits there and he's in fits of laughter, he loves it.
I thought it was Ben yesterday afternoon I dropped Lynsey's thing in with Ben down there and it's Jack, I like John, I like to speak to John, so I said John I think it's Tommy for you, but then
he said no it's Jack, and he said
you know I'm having a clear out and he promised him a tin
Might be from one of the holidays

Bought a Vax, they said no they're a con don't worry, he said with a little bit of luck you'll get one that'll be free, you'll have to give a report on it once a month, then about after nine months they give it to you  if they thought

but I, he says he didn't, I mean, since she's had the chop, but between having the first and then having the twins, the second, she went back to work then at the Building Society, so she's got a cheaper mortgage, so why didn't they pay some off then?

yeah
er just down Water Road and back up again, and I talked to them, er, I see, I phone you and Stuart come in this morning
yeah
done a financial and er  my er, this afternoon I had a guy come in with a Capri, bloody welding that thing needs doing, I don't think he'll get it done, so I was, I was
nearly half an hour
yeah
oh thank you, I don't think I'll get that, too much for it and I got the guy I went out to see Lee  he came in
yeah
I said to him, my missus knows you
I don't know him   this is bad as
but er, who she then?
I said er Lisa , so Alan , oh yeah, Charlie, I said that's right, yeah 
No, he started off with
only small you know
yeah, so anyway erm, he bought the car in to tell me that, garage down here, five hundred and forty eight pound labour  right and that was put on another wing, save repairing the wing, put a new on, so what I did with mine is, I put on a new wing, right, and reduced the labour by sixty five quid to four hundred and five, I make plenty on the parts
yeah
I will, see he probably hasn't got as good as discount as me, so
yeah
five hundred and for ,
so have you got the job?
He want's us to do it, apparently he's been recommended to me, I
yeah
oh yeah, my that's good
yeah it is 
so er  that's a sprayed bonnet, a brand new bonnet, spraying it
yeah
with primer on, spraying inside and the outside, taking off both the wings and bump bit where the bonnet goes on to the slam pan, gotta take the er the wings out, I mean the, the lights out anyway.
yeah
We'll take them out and throw them away and that's all within the maker of the er, of the wings, er take them out, throw them away, er take the bumper off, throw that away, right, get a new number plate, a new bumper  right cos the bumper's got to come off anyway with the wings
yeah
there's no extra labour, I normally charge about a hundred and thirty pound for each wing, that's two hundred and sixty  er  eighty pound for the bonnet, well about a hundred pound for the bonnet, that's three hundred and sixty then er, forty five quid for the slam pan, that's it 
cut it all away, be off and done, about three days work
what they charge for
four hundred and thirty quid, he said bloody hell, so what I said to him is, I know you're gonna need a car, what I'll do is er, I'll get to work, I'll put it, I'll bring the car, you bring the car in beginning of the month, next month, right, said I won't be able to guarantee that I'll get it done in a week cos I've got other work booked in, but I'll have it in here which means I'll be able to do work to your car, right, and it's better me being able to do that, then it, it's sitting out outside your house and nobody touching it for a couple of weeks, now, I might have it for a couple of weeks, see and I'll be able to do it in my own leisurely time then
yeah
yeah, I work on these other cars and I'll be able to do that in the meantime

What does he do?
What do you mean, work wise or
What does he do at home?
Oh he, well he potters around and  goes slowly!
Like a bloody tortoise!
I told you I sat round there once and it took him an hour  a whole hour, and I'm, I'm not exaggerating  to fit  or to put up  half a sheet of wallpaper!
And it wasn't the full length of the wall because they got a dado rail  it was  half.
It took an hour!
One sheet?
One sheet!
I was getting so frustrated!
I was gonna say, Kevin, do you want me to do that?
I'll do it!
I'll put it up!
I was at eight months pregnant at the time.
You were?
Yeah.
When was that?
Last year!


Look dear!
Can't you remember  that one?
Yeah.
It really did.
It took him ages!
Think I remember you telling me.
Yeah.
It'll take him about three weeks to do the decorating in that house!
I mean,
What wallpapering you mean?
said.
Yeah, wallpapering.
The border, well I dunno about the bor .
Yeah, and she did see rather surprised that I'd finished one wall!


Bloody hell Melvin!
I know!
Yeah, well I didn't know what to say!
Just get on with it.
Yeah.
You know  as quick as you can but do it as neat as you can.
Yeah.
You know?
I'm just a bit pissed off with the way the wallpaper's hanging!
It appears to be the white stuff.
The plain one.
Cos it's  I was good  up to around the window.
Brilliant there!
From there it goes fucking shitty!


Then it goes good again!
So  Weird!
.
I'm changing paste anyway.
I'm gonna try a different paste.
I should definitely take the paste down.
I know.
But I go for them cos of the bright yellow packaging!
Er, that was Solvite.
Solvite.
Solvite.
What you gonna have, the Polycell?
I had Polycell for this, yeah.
Yeah.
Try the
Do it well with Polycell!
Then it's buy again!
Ah!
Might make that.
Yeah I know!
Got to get some.
Mm.
Plenty of time for that.
Is preparation work  boring?
Yep.
Hell of a lot!
Oh!
More than that one!
As plaster goes
I don't dare!
I reckon .
Oh well!
It won't.
What needs doing in the toilet downstairs to the ceiling?
You asked him to leave your  on the
Put wood, put woodwork in there.
Oh, yeah.
Right, the paint need coming off.
Been painted a lot!
I know!
Peeling paint.
Peeling
You need to chip it 
the corner.
off?
Yeah.
Scrape that off.
I think it might need burning off because if you leave it on  it's gonna be a bit oddish!
I don't know if I artex, artex wood?
I don't know.
No..
If I could artex the wood, it's a lot easier cos all you've gotta do is just scrape it and leave it.
Scrape all the loose bits off.
I don't know what that wood's, the wood's there for anyway!
It's part of the stairs!
Oh is it?
Yeah.
Part of the stairs.
houses aren't they?
Put up quick!
Oh I'll have a toilet in there.
There's no room in there.
You'll be    , cos there's no television  so there's no  gonna need all these sockets!


All these sockets are added.
It has been wallpapered.
Since.
In here it has anyway.
Yeah.
Just upstairs I think.
That's if it  had any sockets upstairs!
I'd like to know where they were.
Ones that they took out.
That  a bit knotted!
Can't .
This is gonna be a hard room to decorate!
Wallpaper's gonna be stuck!
I would just paint over it.
No.
I'll wallpaper it.
Oh!gonna need an ambulance,get bashed about!
To wallpaper it!
I don't mind if you don't!
Yeah, I don't mind this painted.
If the er    what's gonna get damaged  wallpaper wise?
Well, if somebody walks round with a pen or a pencil, or crayons.
That won't be just si , it's gonna be about a year or so's time!
Yeah I know!
So, I mean, what's the point of  you know  making it look really, really nice and  you know, all you could is just slap a coat of paint over it!
Honestly, I think you'd be silly to decorate it!
Yeah, you reckon?
Yeah  I really do.
Do it when they're older?
Yeah.
Then when we can choose  you know?
I'm painting the woodwork though!
Oh yeah, woodwork painted!
You know, change that to white.
You know, frames and  skirting boards.
Oh yeah, do all the woodwork and that, but just paint, literally paint over the walls.
I mean it'll be fresher cos the paper's not bad is it?
No, not really.
Then er  really 
 
I think it'll be the best thing, you know, just in case you do get crayon and felt tip over the walls and that!
And then you haven't ruined  wallpaper that you've gone out and bought especially.
Decorating that room though!
Oh yeah, decorate that and the hall.
Do that one next.
Yeah.
But I mean, this is gonna be like the family room  so, I mean, it is gonna get  knocked about a bit!
Yeah, that's gonna be our room!

But John said, when she's stupid enough to be trying to sell that house  and who'd buy that thing, stuck up the end of that road?
Not many people would!
Well then, when they went there it were, it were grass fields all round them, weren't it?
Out the back 
Oh yeah.
and round her.
And John said to her, and that's what were happening, they were building.
No they're not!
They said, not they're not!
We're gonna have green fields around us!
Well I knew they were building there years ago!
And by time they be bought  signed the contract and moved in, they was out to plotting the garden weren't they?
You could  but you can't tell them can you, anything no?
They knows it all!
They'll find it harder to sell.
They'll find it hard to sell they will.
Well in any case they're gonna lose money on it, cos they won't get 
Cor yeah!
sixty nine, nine seven five on it, what they give for it will they?
Is that what they give for it, sixty nine thou ?
sixty nine thousand!
What!
I wouldn't pay that!
Not up there!
I'd move to nicer areas 
 
for that!
I bet you there is!
This house is  bigger than theirs!
Is it?
Ain't you ever been in it?
No!
It's horrible!
Mm.
Cos you, where your lounge is you got  a window and it's up
up there.
it's up there!
And it's the same, about 
Definitely don't like that!
that depth, and it's along there.
That's all the like  the window you got in one area.
And the, and then the next door,Close, is a, a detached house.
So yo ,yo , you got no light much in it.
And tha , that's sort of, it's a,
Yeah.
window sill on there, say, and then this comes down  and they got French windows at the bottom.
And the kitchen, you ain't got a kitchen  door, to get from out your kitchen, to outside!
Have you?
No.
How do you go outside?
You gotta come through your carpet way  and through your French windows or out your front door, ain't you?
Yeah.
You haven't got a 
How 
back door!
haven't they?
No!
No!
They ain't, have they?
I've never see,the back door.
No.
Wouldn't work!
No back door.
I would imagine  i ,i , if they went to look at it for fire and, or anything like that you'd be in the wrong cos you couldn't get out the kitchen.
Yeah, go out the back door.
You think about it, it's never, I mean  we had to have a special fire door put on cos our  we go through to our garage.
Yeah.
Special fire door and a special  seal round it.
You need a door to get out the back, don't you ay?
Don't wanna use the French doors!
can you?
I know.
Don't wanna use the French doors all the time wouldn't you?
No.
They do!
Assuming it's cold.
Well in tha , in any case as well i it's  if you've got any rubbish to take outside 
Yeah!
you gotta 
Yeah.
take it through your house don't you?
Yeah.
You know, your kitchen waste?
Yeah.
Bugger that!
 
Well the .
No, this house is bigger than theirs!
Lot bigger.
And we ain't got no room.
No!
The only thing they've got is a 
Oh well it makes this house tidy and junky!
Yeah.


The only thing they've got 
Beg your pardon !
No!
No, but once you get yourselves decorating and  you've put your things out anyway
That's it.
you're gonna be so much better ain't you?
Yeah.
I mean, you've got so much 
Yeah but, we decided 
stuff .
we decided we gotta get a u ,u ,u ,er  a bedroom units  A one.
Mm.
So we'll, we'll survive with what we've got  we'll get bedroom units a little later on.
Probably get one for the little room, probably  get er
I think you gotta put 
I dunno.
cupboards up there once they're painted.
Get one down here as well.
That's it.
Once they're painted your cupboards will be able to put stuff in them and that won't they?
Oh yeah.
You know, you can organise them.
Yeah.
Well we're taking the cupboard in our room  I think we're probably taking that out.
Gonna take it out  because  then we can move the bed over to that wall.
Yeah.
So we can arrange the furniture decently  in the room.
Maybe have to get a  fitted  fitted unit down the side.
Fitted one.
Yeah.
That's what we want.

He can have .
That's right, yeah.
Yeah.
Two hundred and thirty quid.
Yeah.
And er  so he comes round  and he says er  why won't you do it for ninety quid?
I said, so I've seen the job  and I says er  and I don't think it's worth doing for ninety quid.
I'll do it for a hundred and thirty quid  no more!
If you don't like it, fuck off!
Yeah.
I were fuming I was!
I'm standing there  the silly bloke, he stood near where the gas equipment was  and I was standing there  both hands clenched  ready for him to start saying something!
Yeah.

And er, he turned round er  he was very polite  I must admit  kept his cool  and 
Well cos had to be didn't he?
Yeah.
Bigger than me!
Yeah.
Big bloke!
Yeah.
He was  very big bloke!
That wouldn't of worried you!
Oh no way!
So anyway erm  he turned round and said er  well   quote like that and you're legally bind to do it.
I says, no I'm not!
Cos I ain't signed anything!
No !
He says this is a binding contract.
I says  no it ain't  I says I ain't signed anything!
He says, that was done over the phone!
I said 
Yeah.
to you on the phone that I  had not seen the job  and that I said yes  alright  knowing I hadn't seen the job, also that you knew that I hadn't seen it  and if I didn't agree with it, then I was gonna change it, and I've changed it!
Yeah.
Then he started on  he started tutting, the old , I jus sa I just carried on working, I just slammed the Citreon on  cranked that up  and er  he started  going on about oh  this is the price and everything.
I just turned round and says  mine was the cheapest price anyway!
I noticed the other  quote was over two hundred flaming quid, and you've knocked me down!
I said  fuck off out of here!
Yeah.
It's quite good that that chap had actually showed you  the right  quote weren't it?
Yeah, cos  yeah.
Yeah.
And that, anyway, he then says er  er er er he said, he said something like  I weren't really listening.
Yeah.
I says I'll  Gods our original er  our authorisation.
I says, yeah, and I couldn't find it could it?
I says oh, it must be at home!
Anyway er  I said  he says, well can you post it to us?
I said, yeah alright I'll post it to you.
So he wanted it back.

Open up the door  and he said hello  I went Werh er er!

He says er  anybody  or anything he says er  you can't let them in can you, well they won't, they can't come in can they?
I didn't answer him!


I found the letter and he went.
Yeah.
And that's it.
So what's he gonna do about that then?
Well he can't do a thing about it!
I know.
He knows he can't !
He's got the car!
You know perhaps he could of  on.
That's insurance company.
Well they're such pigs aren't they!
Ahhh!
Yeah, well tha , they've dropped themselves right in it now!
They have!
In actual fact, what you wanna do now is to er  perhaps have a little er  letter writing to Avon.
Yeah.
Tell them what you think of them.
And er let them yeah let 
Yeah do.
them know what sort of, how  have behaved.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I do it?
So  complete with threats!
And er  just tell them that er  the way they've behaved, that you thought the way to 
I mean  though innit?
Well  
You thought the way they behaved was er  despicable!
Well, it's the way he spoke on the phone in the first place!
Yeah.
Er  when he wanted to knock it down.
Yeah.
You know, I was only  been working there a week, well two weeks!
Yeah.
Something like that.
Yeah but you must complain to Avon though!
Cos Avon's a big insurance company.
And I've done 
I know, I've had 
I've done lots of work for them in the last couple 
And I've done work for them
of years.
already!
Yep.
Separate from  Quadling 
Yeah  yeah.
That's right.
Now, and he come  their assessor
Yeah.
looked at the car, and said do it!
Yeah.
Well   
No hassle whatsoever!
That's right, yeah.
Right, well if give me their address, then we can get a letter.
Yeah  you've got address.
Yeah, it's at  at er
That's it,
Wentworth.
Wentworth.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Oh well, you know   you can draft a letter up   
Oh I will!
Yeah, just say that you were very 
She'll love me!
disappointed with the way their agents, i.e.  Quadling er  have been behaving!
Dealing , yeah.
And er  er  also mention the fact that er  er  you know for a fact  or, or, you know  that er  the other quotes that er  put in a bill, put in a bill for a er  about a hundred pound more than what I did, or whatever, whatever 
Mm.
it was!
And er  they'll know this  and er 
Oh yeah!
then, then just tell them the facts  you know?
Yeah.
And also mention that er this bloke came round and issued a  offered er int , er intimidation and threats!
Legal threats as well!
Yeah, and some days you need to .
Yeah.
And er  you know  put it down in writing because  that way Avon will then se see  and the , hang on!
What's  Quadling playing at here!
We're not having that!
Yeah.
We're not having this!
Yeah.
And also state  that over the years  er  your father  used to run the business  done hundreds of jobs for Avon Insurance  at, and er  also you yourself have done jobs for Avon Insurance before  who have never ever had any trouble whatever so ever!
Like er  you know, with any of the work we've done
No.
er  it's always been er  guaranteed  i.e. if a customer was not satisfied, then one hundred percent we will rectify whatever it is they're not satisfied with.
Mm.
We always maintain that  our word is our bond  all of our work.
And then  to be treated  er  as out and out er  criminals, like this  Quadling had done with us  is just beyond all bounds of having reasonable
Mm.
business sense!
Yeah.
But wha but when he'd said, turned round and said, oh it's a legal contract!
I'd tell him 
It's not!
to fuck off!
Not over the phone.
Spoken  as in   but it's  you know
You've gotta sign something.
I know.
But that's  intimidation that is, threats 
That's right.
at you.
Okay, yes I agreed  for the er  the price  but I said that I haven't seen the work.
I hadn't seen 
Okay.
the job.
I've, I've quoted for the job.
That's right.
I says okay  I'll agree to it but I wanna se , I haven't seen it, so how do I know?
Yeah.
You know  that's what I said to him  on the phone!
Oh we'll remember that!
By the way, I've told you I got charged er  fifteen pounds did I?
Oh I told you Mel, did I?
Yeah.
And ten pounds from the bank!
Cos I was twenty five pence overdrawn!
So I wrote a stinking letter to them!
A one of the  one of the sentences,, how dare you authorise  the withdrawal of fifteen pounds from account  without prior notification!
Or at least having the decency and good manners to at least let me know what you'd done!
Yeah!
And er, anyway I got this terrific letter back!
You should, well  granddad was there  about half an hour reading it!
It was er one foolscap plus  of, of words you know, explaining what, what they'd done  and all this  and why they'd done it !
They credited you?
And  yeah, they've gone and re-credited me for the fifteen pound!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Great!
Bit over the top innit?
Fifteen quid for twenty five pence!
Well then, no, what it is they've charged for each 
Yeah.
cheque that you
Yeah.
you do about a quarter.
I wouldn't of minded, like I said to the bloke er  if he, if I'd been er  a hundred pounds overdrawn  or fifty quid overdrawn or something like that, I wouldn't of minded so much because I knew 
Yeah.
that I would be overdrawn.
Mm.
And I'd know that I'd incurred that expense.
But er  but a mere twenty pe pence!
I thought, it's an insult my flipping intelligence!
Yeah.
That's right.
But it was , you know.
Well anyway I got this lovely letter back!
Oh well!
So letter and er  and evening compiling it  has er gained me my fifteen pound back!
Yeah.


No it doesn't hurt to write a few letters.
Old bloke came round today.
Oh David!
Yes.
Cor he did half stink of booze!
Oh it's
Yeah, apparently he had a row with his Mrs  ex-Mrs  wife.
Yeah.
He had a row with his new wife  .
So why did he come round and see you?
Dunno.
Start again  on booze!
Bought a Volvo, T reg    forty quid!
Did he?
Well if, if he's got an M O T on it he'll be able to run it until the M O T
runs out November.
runs out.
Oh well he can run until then, then and  just take it out to  and leave it there.
He's done it up.
Has he?
He's doing it up.
Yeah.
And what are they doing about it, nothing!
I reckon it ought to be compulsory that.
Like a car needs to go in for the M O T, you've gotta
Mm, you've gotta have your eyes tested.
for your eyes.
Yeah.
In Germany you have to carry, if you wear glasses, you have to carry a spare pair of glasses with you!
Yeah.
I had to do this in Adelaide you know, when I went for my D S V license.
I had  loads of dots in front of me  you know, in this machine
Colour blind.
and er yeah, I had to er tell them what numbers were what er letters 
Mm.
numbers rather were coming, coming up, you know?
And I just ran through them, you know, it was no problem  to me.
But I can image yo ,yo , you can stand  
You'd fail.
doing it.
So  and er  ooh I had  they did er  this old butterfly thing as well, the old psychology bit as well , you know.
What does that look like?
You know !
A blob of ink squashed together what else!
You know?
Yeah.
And er  how old?
That was the first time I had to cough for anybody that was, as well.
.
I didn't particularly like that idea.
Just testing for a hernia, I told I hadn't got one!
Yeah.
Ha!
It's like that er  truck driver that came into your place when er  you and er  that bloke that used to there.
And a  he came in there and er  for his glasses  and er  old  was having a headache actually  everything
Oh yeah.
and he, he was a  er  said he was nearly enough, near enough blind!
Mm!
And here he is  driving trucks around the countryside!
Did he?
Yeah.
And he persisted  as well!
Yeah, he didn't need glasses for driving!
You know  er!
The old, old ones are the worst, I tell you!
Yeah.
Well anybody over forty years old it ought to be, it ought to be compulsory!
Mm.
Yeah.
It's like, I remember nan  don't need glasses!
Yeah.
She should be wearing glasses.
Yeah.
Well what, I'll never forget this chap do up on Avenue Road he were  like that!
He'd been driving for  sixty years, you've never had an accident.
Yeah, I mean, his vision was absolutely appalling!
Yeah.
I said, well you shouldn't be driving!
Yeah.
See even with glasses on!
Yeah.
No, my driving's alright ma !
But he can't hear nothing about !
No, he can't actually no!
Except get the cops in.
It's a privilege .
I'll always maintain that people with glasses know they've got something wrong with their eyes so  the chances are if they're wearing glasses then they can see properly!
Yeah.
It's the guy that hasn't got glasses, that's the guy you've gotta worry about.
Yeah.
That's right.
What's the time?
Any idea?
Five to nine.
Oh right.
Red Dwarf on in a minute.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Ooh!
Excuse me!
Ah ah!

No, I don't 
I was sort of driving along, what?
Damn thing's slowing down!
I was looking for this blooming half thing sticking out!
Ha!
They stopped them about nineteen fifty nine, something like that.
He's driving around without his glasses on!
Why isn't he tested?
Fancy having a car for that many years!
Yeah.
He will though, he'll get more now than  what he's paid for it !
Yeah.
Japanese cars, you can stick them!
Cheap cars  expensive to repair!
They are yeah!
Well I'm pleased with my Citreon.
Yeah?
The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it's not a  a three litre engine.
Oh!
But er  it does everything I want it to.
Can't wait to get that Sierra!
Yeah, you've done well with that.
Yeah.
Ay?
