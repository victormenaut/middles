Put it in the er  near the far door I've put it.
So you can spent it out?
He's put, put a new er socket in on Tuesday.
Oh another so 
Well then we ain't gotta traipse wires across so you can put it in 
Oh!
Cos it was up in the side, yeah.
Yeah.
There's one at the back of the free , double one at the back of the freezer, so he's put it right this side so it's just up above it there.
Oh!
Mine stays permanently inside just have to
Well tha ,thi that's what this is, yeah.
But I do switch 
And have you got 
it off because it's so wet in there!
Oh aye, yeah!
Er, I've put a cloth on the top of it cos we'd only put it in on the Tuesday and it was wet through on the top!
Cos it was just dripping off, cos it's  a tin roof, aluminium roof!
And when it, when it gets mild, it just pours straight off!
You know what you would, I would suggest you did?
You know the   instead of just putting a cloth straight on it 
Yes.
you know the strawb the tomato boxes?
Tomato boxes?
You know?
Them cardboard things with  handle on?
No?
The wooden ones.
Oh yeah!
You know the ones that you  you know 
Yeah.
like I have in my garage with the  bits on edge to 
Yeah!
Yeah!
stack them up?
We well one or two of those on top of it, turned 
Yeah.
Yeah.
so that they're standing with a gap 
On the
And then your cloth on  so that the cloth isn't sitting on the top because it'll rust it, if it's wet.
Will it?
Yeah.
Oh right!
Where would I get one of them 
Cos it won't dry on top 
from?
Round the be , erm round 
Out the greengrocers?
Ask them if they've got some wooden
What a tomato box?
the old toma type tomato boxes.
Oh!
Alright.
I'll do that then.
And put  we well one or two on 
Yeah!
Just 
Just to leave  lift it off because 
So i 
if it's sitting on the top and the top doesn't get that hot.
Ah!
The top doesn't get 
Right.
hot so that, not enough to dry 
So it won't be enough to dry it out.
Oh yeah.
Oh right!
Oh we'll do that then.
It might be better er, have you stood it on so , if it's damp in the garage on the floor?
Yes.
On some wood.
Yes, I got some 
Right.
wood er, things and the pipes 
To lift it on?
and I thought he can put that on something so that's not resting on the floor as well, cos that's where the wet's on the 
Yeah.
floor.
Cos your pipes should be 
I think you have to be 
really, your pipes should be levels, should go  I drape my pipe over it  if I do it, or hang it up at the back.
Oh dear!
Shouldn't it be on the floor?
Oh!
Cos it has to do that.
You really want it on level.
Do you?
It's easier if it's on the level  ah  side up cos it should  I've never had mine on the floor.
It should go out of a window
Yeah.
or high up  but if you've got a little hook 
Oh!
on it  you 
Yes.
know how you  is there a metal erm  thing to hold it on on 
Yeah.
Yeah.
to the back?
Yeah.
Well that's, what I do is I use that metal that you can hang it with  and just hang it onto a little hook so it's up and over and out of the way.
And that's how it should be is it?
Well Pete didn't 
Should be sho 
know that.
And 
Well 
we didn't, we didn't put it like that.
Should have just 
No.
laid it straight on, flat on the floor.
Well I, I wouldn't lay it on the floor cos i , cos it'll just er  it tends to hold the condensation in it.
Does it?
Oh right!
Okay?
Oh we'll look into that and !
Blow up!
Well my, my, my , well mine's just had enough
I was just filling my bowl in the lounge cos  somebody said to me to get  water in the lounge in a bowl  see if it could help me with my breathing, you know.

He's touched it, and he's took it off out in the kitchen altogether, the kitchen's !

We done everything what you're supposed to do, Roger  and he said it could take days and days for you to get it right!
Does the bottom one want  did the top want bleeding or the bottom one want bleeding again?
No, we've tried all the bleeding business, and he said it's, the trouble is it's the bathroom and toilet, you moment you turn that slightly off  it just cuts the ba er, kitchen off straight away.
Cos they, it's ran off that one,i it joins over the, yeah.
When one turns off?
And it just sets it off.
