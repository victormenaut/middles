I like the way you just .
 

Well this advertising
Yeah but the humanities
sa 
two asa , assignments  I got an extension.
extension.
An extension?
I have, I asked for an extension because like, in, in light of my present mathematical ne , need for seriousness, for seriously doing a hell of a lot of maths homework
Mm.
so that I can do my exam.
They told me to do our exams early.
I'd like .
You know, a year early.
Shut up !
Such a tosser !
.
What?
So what, so you just look at it and do, look at the  the grade eight rubbish on that sheet that we're doing?
Basically, the secret is to do
What you're asked to do.
two plans , and  and choose one of them, with a reason, for why you chose it.
Yeah.
That's  you need that 
That's crap!
to get an A  in that thing.
Erm, I don't reckon I'll get all A's this time.
No.
I might do, but I doubt it.
The thing is you, you'll get them.
Er, he's not gonna give it to you twice though is he cos  I don't reckon he would di give it to you twice.
He don't, he don't give it to you twice?
What?
Don't you reckon?
No he could, but he's not gonna want to.
Is he?
I hope it's worth A's but I don't think it is.
Next time that's on that should 
It's best not to notice it.
All these are smashed you know.
What?
All these are smashed.
And they've only been here, what, two weeks?
Not even two weeks.
What that?
No not that one.
It's a new one.
Yeah I know.
Yeah, but this hasn't  it sho , it, first put it up with no glass, so they put the glass in  then it looked like a mirror
Mm.
and then it got, and then it got smashed.
But all of them I know are smashed.
Cos there's one at  two, or three bus stops back, you know, by Lisa's an , by Lisa's house.
That's what .
Yeah.
Where's the fucking bus !
They've smashed it, smashed up the bus stop.

Ah!
I've left my music homework as well.


I shall have to go to the house.
Yeah, I've gotta do music homework because
What's that?
ah I've gotta invent a, a melody.
I'll probably ring up James and ask him what he's done.
I've got to invent a melody  about erm  all of minor scales.
Which isn't actually hard but I have to write it down as well.
And I ho , I would have done this on  Tuesday  when I actually worked out a melody but I didn't  manage a bit of paper  so I couldn't write it down.
Mhm.
Which is a major bummer.
Why haven't yous got a part in, why are you are, auditioning for West Side Story?
What?
Why are you auditioning for West Side Story?
I don't have time.
Why didn't you audition er
Oh.
Erm, er did you have the music, did you have music homework Josie?
I can't hear her.
What she say?
Well you're not gonna tape anything!
I am.
All through music, non fucking stop.
My only thing in life will be for the next hour and forty minutes  fuck, I live to tape, okay?
But it's gonna be boring.
My conversation will be a lot more interesting won't they?
Our registrations are funny!
Lo , la la la.
Our registrations are funny Peter!
Yeah but if he lends it out he'll  
Yeah exactly.
Exactly, you know, and this is so weird hearing yourself talk and 
Cos er, if you tape, cos I'll if your voice comes in the conversation  I've got it all on tape now you stupid cow!
Josie, erm  have you erm, erm there it is.
Hello.
Have you erm, done any, did you have music homework?
Yeah, I didn't do it.
No.
Don't Peter, it hurts.
me or you?
Do I really care whether it hurts you, honestly?
Do you really reckon?
Oh no!
My dad used to work erm  and this bloke used to like a pint of erm, oh I can't remember 
Export.
export , yeah, I can't remember what it's like.
Right?
And there's a little dog with a , so that's why he likes a drink.
Right?
Oh yeah, and his dog, yeah  likes it as well yeah, they used to leave a tray out for him every night, yeah  when it was closing time the dog knew every time it closed, it wo , I mean if they closed at lunchtime it wouldn't come down  it would only come down when they closed up at night.
And it goes on, it goes on every night right?
If you put a pint of beer out for him he wouldn't drink it.
You put a little drop of lemonade in it, he'll drink it.


And until you, if you just lemonade, wouldn't drink it.
But if yo , if it was bitter and a bit of lemonade it would drink it, nothing else.
Er, you know the same thing they tried down at 
Yeah.
got my dad erm  er, just drink pints after pints of Guinness.


He just sits there lapping up all these like  bowls of
He does?
Guinness.
The dog.
Yeah but this this this dog will only drink it if it had a little bit of lemonade in.
It's so funny .
The dog's permanently drunk.
It sits there going .


The dog's like
Oh yeah .
What are you doing?
Yeah, it attacks anything .
Any fizzy drink?
What?
?
No.
What about  spirits?
No she doesn't, no.


She doesn't actually eat anything that's actually bad for her.
Oh and Guinness isn't bad for you?
Pints and pints of Guinness?
Oh.
What it doesn't drink alcohol?
How does it know 
 
how does it know if it's bad for you or not?
I don't know, it's jus , it's like anything that's bad she doesn't seem drink.
Get some lemonade right and  it.
Just to  
Yeah but she won't.
She won't.
You get some lemonade with cyanide in it  and some Coke with cyanide in and see what she drinks.
She doesn't like the gas.
Flat lemonade.
She still won't drink it.
Why not?
I dunno.
I try giving her Coke all the time because she looks like she's begging for my Coke.
Yeah?
If I pour her some Coke  she won't drink it.
But the guy is an arsehole  also.
But he's just, he's just, he's like, he's so  you can read what he's done.
I mean, you can understand him, so easily.
It started off
Acts like a complete dick to try and get attention.
And then he went slightly  relaxed  and now he's being a dick again.
Like, you know, this morning in erm language  he jumps off a table screaming, ow, ow, ow!
No.
For a start he shouldn't have been on the table.
Secondly, he doesn't need to  that's just stupid.
The one that you're, you're, you're taking, right, just means that you  you .
Yes.
No, oh oh, you can't.
No.
I thought you said she did it.
Mm mm, wo oh .
Right, and the other thing  sorry, but he also  reckons he's God about girls.
He reckons he knows everything.
He's not.
I don't like Elsa either.
Why not?
Ah!
She's just so irritating.
She's just so
Fuck  would be good one.
Everything's come out my bag.
Bloody way!
Aargh!
Come on Peter  get  on the bus.
Ah shit!
My sister really needed that.
She, cos like, cos you know like these interesting lighters when she went to France?
Yeah.
Yeah.
In, in the science museum she saw these really nice lighters  and she comes back and my mum's in the same room and she says, I nearly bought you a lighter.
Thanks ma , you know  I really want my mum to hear that.
Well
And she lost my fucking camera!
Make her pay for it.
No, I'll get a, I'll get a replacement off my parents, but  sorry, she changed the film cos  sixteen pictures of it were my ones  cos I hadn't used the film
Yeah but  
some of them , some of them might be of Spain .
Of Spain.
I hate her!
Ah no!
Ah no!
No, but she changed the film before she lost it so it's alright.
Did she?
It's like, one day developing right and she hasn't got round to collecting them yet.
It's been like a week.
What is the point of paying for  one day developing?
Yeah but er, you pay, you pay so much for twenty four 
Exactly.
hours.
And if you go, if you're not gonna pick them up the next day.
It's like my mum, she paid to get them developed right and about two weeks later she goes in  that's how much it costs for a week.
I went, oh no!
About six, costs six quid to develop overnight
Yes.
so he said he  no, she said 
And she had to pay six quid for
No, she paid five seventy five that was all.
Why?
Because  she, it would have been twenty four hours.
Yeah but you said it was six.
Yeah, five seventy nine though.
You know, erm 
Ah.
Almost six.
you know.
Yeah.
She collected it a week later?
Mm!
One hour time.
One hour developing next year.
But Alex .
Alex's family, the  s, they are weird.
I am sorry.
They are a slightly weird family.
No, they're always late  actually.
What's weird  about being late?
No, they actually, listen, listen.
Like, all their films came, like Alex's film of er Spain  empties the camera  basically puts it in this pile they keep in a drawer somewhere of films, okay?
Every now and then when they feel like it, take a handful of films and get them developed.


It's like the re , most latest ones have been from like six years ago.


Just  bloody irritating.
I couldn't , I can't .
Yeah.
Really, the week before, every now and again I wanted to stick .
Just the way we were.
Still
Alright.
Darren.
Are you going in town Sally?
Oh yeah.
But Miss, have you ever had Miss ?
No.
You're so lucky right.
She didn't believe,sh , we'll drop our theory off, round for tomorrow night.
Her the , er she believed non-competitive .
How can have non-competitive ?
It doesn't work.
The whole thing, the reason you go, do so well in it
Yeah.
is cos you compete against other people so you do loads of matrices.
But she had er the non-competitive version.
So how did you work that out?
Well she didn't want it competitive cos you'll be doing it against yourself not everyone else.
Which is alright as a theory but it doesn't work cos you don't get any work done.
See what I'm saying?
What she wants to talk about, everyone  has to do matrix or  learn more of the crap.
No, it was just, she didn't want you to be competitive about it.
So she didn't expe , you know the ma , matrix system  of levels and stuff  I didn't fully understand that until the fourth year  when I went with Miss   cos she never explained it because she didn't reckon you needed to know.
She's a bitch!
See ya!
I was walking to school, right cos    saw this in the shop 
Is that back on?
cos sp sp , the bus strike.
But I thought that was Friday?
No it's today I think.

Could go to Tamsins.
Yeah, we could.
Do you want to?
No, no, not particularly .
Could go to Lisa's.
Has she erm, recovered from Malaria?
Oh shame!
Exactly what I thought.
I lau , I laughed, you know, I laughed hard.
 
And I,i i , it's fucking sad, she's pretty sick.
Sounds rough.
But I can probably look good with a .
Hang on!
Hang on!
You've only just gone off ro , erm  Tamsin .
And trying for Janet, yeah.
Try and keep cont ,so co , some control of your hormones.
No I can't .
I've realized that I've never been out of love.
Oh!
Good for you.
But you've never been loved.
True.
So we'll walk in the general direction of Tamsin .
Alright.
Okay.
Has 
What 
she got a  though?
Has she got a  though?
ah, but what's the ?
I dunno.
We might decide to go to her house.
Ah well I've gotta come back for ten, so
Stay.
Ah yeah, well, I gotta leave, start coming back at ten.
Alright, stay for ten minutes and then,can come back.
Hang on, I think yo , in England or in  erm  where they 
What?
go?
Tunisia.
Tunisia.
In Tunisia in hospital?
Oh!
Shit!
That's pretty good.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
She, she's in hospital here I think.
So she came back with Malaria?
Yeah.
 
I'm not, I'm not sure.
I only saw her sister.
Why didn't she have jabs?
I don't have a clue!
Balls!
It's balls!
That's why I laughed.
Balls!
Look, you laughed, I laughed.
Right, when I went to Turkey, I had three jabs before I went away  and every two days I took two tablets.
Ma anti-malaria tablets.
Oh bless her!
What?
Well don't say that's overreacting cos 
I don't give a fuck!
Don't give a fuck
cos you could say that's overreacting but  I haven't got malaria   and   Lisa has.


So there's the proof for it.
Ah shit!
So that is so fucking sad!
She's got malaria!
Yeah, but it can be treated in this country.
What?
But, can't they treat it in this country?
Yeah, they probably can.
Yeah.
Erm, cos then, they're doing tests  to see if she has got it, but it's highly, highly likely that she has.
So who have you phoned up then?
Nobody.
Zang told me.
Oh Zang phoned you?
How did Zang find out?
Zang phoned Lisa.
Oh Christ!
He doesn't waste time  does he ?
Why?
Just cos he phoned her.
Well we know he fancies her right?
No.
He doesn't.
He doesn't?
He doesn't.
Oh!
They're friends.
Do you want a Werther's Original?
Yeah, please.
I could roll this through the mud, spit on it  and put it through dog's  dirtisisism and most people would still say yes please.


True?
True.
That was so funny!
Ah God!
I'm ill.
How come?
I'm bloody ill.
Sore throat.
Great!
Ha aargh!
These really help.
Yuk!


But    blame John.
No, on the letter though it did say  er wha no I had to ring Sasha you know.
I rang Sasha for my sister.
Yeah?
Funny thing was, Alex answered the phone  and he knows my voice on the phone easily see.
Yeah.
Alex answers the phone.
Hello.
Hello, can I speak to Sasha please?


Which I thought was quite funny.
And I presume that he didn't?
I don't think he's  didn't say anything.
He was probably crying though.
But they got 
oh fuck that!
they gotta be there from nine thirty till  one.
Do you believe that?
Well


They must use a .
I wouldn't mind just  one up there.
Oh shut up!
Look at  Muhammad!
I feel fine.
There is a limit to how much I can take!
No there isn't!
There is actually because  and you're coming bloody close to it.
Dogs.
The only thing I don't like.
Oh.
Tt.
Shall we, erm  have an excuse by saying you wanna  co converse.
She might be still asleep though.
Yeah, probably.
Alex is.
Mm mm.
At a rough guess.
I think he's definitely asleep !
We don't need, we don't need the laws of erm   we don't need the laws of physics 


as proof  Alex is, is still in bed.


I haven't got anything of, talking to my parents right, cos I just don't really.
Oh yeah.
I don't hold conversations with my parents.
Mhm.
Ha .
Did you see Good Morning Vietnam?
Mm mm, no.
No?
Missed it.
I saw a bit.
I would have watched it if I didn't have maths.
Good morning Vietnam!
I, I watched the first ten minutes which was really funny cos  as they're going along in the truck  ah look at that woman!
Ah!
Yes!
Oh what a lovely body!
And, and he goes  no we can't, can we stop?
Please!
Please!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
And the guy driving the truck says, no we can't we've got an important meeting.
Okay.
So, the driver actually speeds up okay?
And then, another woman, exactly the same clothes
Aha.
same hat, so it looks like the same woman  so he says, oh my God!
There she is again!
She's, she's got this fa , how the hell did she get in front of us?
Come on, please, the driver says  I know, I know, speed up, let's test her stamina.


Stopped her dead.
Oh oh.
Did you see that Robin William's thing, Acting Funny?
No.
Oh it was quite interesting.
I actually  
Cos basically , Robin William films are  either  a film  with a character  and Robin Williams  is the character, takes over the film and  Robin Williams comes through, and it's funny.
Okay?
Okay.
Now, you know, erm Good Morning Vietnam?
Mhm.
What it is, is it's a  what, what, aha  what it is er  it's a film  and basically it's a film with spaces in it  for Robin Williams just to say jokes.
Mhm.
Basically to do a routine.
Mhm.
But the problem is, it's a serious film  around that.
Mm.
Okay?
And it doesn't work very well
Mm.
because  yeah, you know  the structure is is 
It's still a good , it's a fi , still a good 
You know the stru ,i , er, most people will be perfectly happy to watch  erm  two hours of Robin Williams being a funny D J
Mm mm.
but putting it around the, well  apparently doesn't work.
And then things like  some of the stories  like 
Yeah.
the Fisher King
Ah, that was good.
that was apparently excellent!
It was good.
Which I never saw.
But  I'm sure it is.
Which you will be opening to public  on Channel Four.
Yeah, probably.
Yeah.
Do you reckon they'll put Toys on?
Nah!
That's a likely possibility .
Actually Muhammad, I don't reckon we should go this way.
Why?
Cos I don't reckon we should go and call on her cos that's  a bit out of order.
It's fucking early!
And also
What time is it then?
What?
What time is it?
I dunno.
I can't reach my watch.
Quarter to ten.
Also, if we co 
We only have to walk down 
also if we , no because if we walk down there  and 
Right.
they look out their window and see us  you know
So?
What the fuck!
So, I don't want anyone thinking 
What the fuck!
Just come round this way Muhammad.
No!
What the fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
Fine.
Fine 
Right.
You go and make a complete prick of yourself.
Why?
But I'm, I don't particularly want to.
Oh come on!
No!
You're not gonna be a ?
Rosa isn't gonna, not gonna do it, Tamsin's not gonna do it right.
You're gonna help me out about that .
Cassie, we don't give a fuck about!
Cassie  Cassie's  oh she has, she's seen Cassie.
Yeah?
Well
Is that Cassie's car?
Mm mm, well not Cassie's, it's somebody's though.
Cassie's, yes it is.
But, it's not Cassie I don't think.
Erm 
Do you wanna or not?
No, not particularly.
Ah come on!
Nope.
Take a risk.
No.
If you, If you're game right  and the entire field is full of mines  and you need to get the last base.
Shut up!
You've gotta take 
No.
a fucking chance!
Muhammad, I have no objective of trying to reach here.
Oh damn!
What obje , I don't have an objective here.
I was just, I'm just running through a field of mines, okay?
Except there isn't another base at the end of it.
What's in there?
Now I've past the last base and you want me to just run through a minefield okay?
And    screw you!
What?
What?
It's a terrible thing .
What you on about?


, what's ?
Sarah.
Oh!
Oh no it did look er like her.
Have you got a bus pass?
Hop on a bus?
What?
Ah.
Sounds alright actually.
You got any money?
How much?
About a pound.
Yeah, that's enough.
No.
Cos I don't wanna make a big thing of it cos  if it was today  we'd have to go  before Sesame Street or after the Sesame Street.
And I said I'd be back for around one cos I wasn't actually planning on doing much 
Ah but  you going to Judo  five, half past five innit?
No next Tuesday or next Monday.
Yeah sure.
What?
Go before and get there 
No but we can go before or after.
Yeah, well the point is if she .
If it's a Bank Holiday then she probably won't be open.
She will be.
No, cos of school.
No it won't be, it's a Bank Holiday.
Ha ha!
Ha ha.
I just wanted to see
Yeah well  I haven't really got time.
But erm  I need to get some rope cos I'm doing, finally I'm doing that act  for my  cousin's birthday who's  nearly two
She  is nearly two.
Can she put up with that?
Erm, erm  I'm supposed to do a show for like her birthday.
Which is easy, cos kids are easy actually.
You just exaggerate.
Like this is my opening routine, I got this out of a book actually, you come, okay?
And go  I'm a bit shy you see, erm  well  I'm a bit shy  and tell the truth  I have to admit I'm a bit shy  so, I when I come on  I'm gonna say hello  and then you say hello back to me.
Okay?
And then, no one has to be shy.
Then I go off.
Okay?
And I come on  and basically they're all gonna shout hello.
Right?
Yeah.
No.
No.
That's not right, no.
I say hello first.
Here, I'll show you.
Go off, I come on.
I go  and wait about for a min , half a sec ,ha , you know just wait for about ten seconds  I've forgotten what I'm supposed to say  wha , can you remind you?
And they all shout hello.
So, I erm  one more time, I go off, I come on.
Hello.
And they say hello.
And that's that.
It's good innit?
That is a bit shit!
Well
No it's not a bit shit.
No, well I wasn't planning on to you know,, I wasn't planning on to do everything  I wasn't planning to use it on 
 
Oh alright.
Oh calm down!
I just didn't wanna see her.
You just can't defy the logic of .
You can't just .
What other shops do you want?
Well I dunno.
What do you wanna buy?
Shops.
What shops?
I got it on my bus pass.
You sure?
Oh!
You know the K two.

Cos of the bus strike I went the way I normally go though.
Yeah.
When I got off the bus she was at Hackney Cen Central with all her friends.
Ow!
Ow!
So you went and pulled her to one side.
No I didn't actually I just, ignored her and went on.
I didn't have time  to talk cos I had to be here for nine.
Oh screw you!
I only got off the bus to catch the bus that was in front and I missed that.
Oh yeah.


I was gonna catch it at the next stop.
Ah!
Have you smashed it?
No.

Oh I dunno.
Cos this one's a bit shit.
Oh shit!
D'ya know what I watched last night?
What?
Inspector Allen Mysteries.
Surprisingly strange.
It's really confusing pop artists with pop art hasn't he?
Why?
Cos pop art is basically taken stuff out of popular  medium
Yeah?
I E, if you were doing 
Yeah.
and you'd fit them together  but if it didn't fit you'd have to do something to  you'd have to get them from som , from somewhere else.
Yeah.
But with a computer right  scan it and i if  take  erm  picked a note or whatever you wanna do to it  you've done it.
Yeah.
So that is all technically .
So don't use computers.
You do.
What?
They do.
Yeah, fine.
See if I care!
Cos that is going to eventually pop up, you just, you've got, I think he's a contact wrong.
