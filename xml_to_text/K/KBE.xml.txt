You see they've got to be seen taking it out 
Yeah outside the door.
Yeah that's right.
Get them outside.
Outside the door yeah that's right.
Stop em and have the stuff on them.
And of course they've gone isn't them?
It's not as easy as it sounds.
God I were in the market and I thought I'd better take a bit more wrapping paper and I  and I had it I said that's ten and of course I get on the  and I didn't know
No
because they're tied together and all  well I never.
I said well I'll buy the two leave them there I said but it's done so simple.
That's it.
Simple that is.
That's it yes.
It's like our Pam.
Our Pam at Tesco didn't she she was telling us didn't she?
Last Fri last Wednesday and she got the trolley like and when she pulled the trolley a woman's handbag was on the trolley and on the you know what was it?
Mm
So she took the  handbag back into Tesco and said I found this handbag erm and they said well give me your name and address and all that so in any rate what happened Bet?
Who's it phoned?
Somebody phoned.
Oh as they come out to Asda they said they found her bag and they give her our Pam's phone number and rung up and thanked our she said there's full of stuff money and all in there and thanked her for what she'd done and our Pam said fair enough I would you know
Hello.
Hello Sal.

Oh ain't that lovely?
Yes nice.
Isn't that nice?
Yeah that's nice.
Yeah that was nice wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah well 
Anyway I said to our Pam well you have been brought up to do things like that and not only that if I found a pound on the floor I'd pick it up  that's different.
Yeah of course that's different.
But not for that.
Anyway she sent her a tenner so she's going to have her hair permed 
I mean you get these trolleys now.
People take them back.
You have to get them pounds out to get the trolleys.
Yeah yeah.
Oh the man takes them all back now over down the .
Does he?
Yeah.
He gets about fifty pounds doesn't he?
Do he?
Yeah.
Good luck too.
Yeah because 
Because he's going to give it to the manager 
They don't charge for the trolleys up there now do they?
No not up there no but down 
Gateways don't do  they don't take their pounds out.
They forget see.
The nice man does it.
Good luck to him.
Oh ah yes.

Cherry stopped him and said what you doing she said George this old man he's said I'm going to give this to the manager like he said because I've been brought all these trolleys back.
She said put it in your pocket.
She said that's your perk that's one of the perks of your job.
You're out there in the cold 
Yeah 
Well Bet it's like getting used to it isn't it?
Where do they where do they take the pound?
To the till desk.
No they're all clipped together
Yeah?
And to get them unclipped you got to push a pound coin in one way and the clip comes out the back
And it comes out the other yes.
So when you take your trolley back and clip it back up the pound comes out the front again.
Oh dear!
I never knew that.
People are still getting used to it aren't they?
Or dump the trolley.
They forget they got a pound in there.
Oh that's  isn't it?
Oh yeah.
Yeah I mean but if you take that to the manager.
What do you think the manager's going to do with it?
He'll put it in his pocket.
He'll put it in his bloody pocket wouldn't he?
Course he would.

So she give him a  and she said
Oh free night tonight.
and she said oh I didn't know what to do.
Which one should I use the blue or the pink?
He's a miserable manager at the  I mean she can't stand him that's in the bar.
Oh she said he's most horrible and he's always gorging he's always eating something like you know.
She says and we can't get a bloody sweet she says.
Oh no you can't.
But that girl that was sacked for pinching what was it?
A plum wasn't it?
It was a plum.
She had a bite out of a plum didn't she?
Something like that

Not up here.
I've been stopped loads of times and had my bag searched

Yeah loads of times.
You must look suspicious like our Jeannie used to look.
Yeah they always stopped by 
I mean they done that in our factory  they stopped  on Saturday morning.
They had three on on  door I mean three security men but it's not worth it mind.
And on a Saturday with Jenny going in if there's any overtime you  and old what's-a-name was there and he came and tapped me on the shoulder.
I did at one time  I know I never I don't I never touch a thing there and I thought  and he would you mind opening your carrier and I've got sanitary towels in there
Oh God no.
and I said and I was hesitating and I said I'm sorry I said I feel a bit embarrassed he said for what reason and old Rose was with me well at door she said she knows me she said well she said if it will interest you what if I never.
I did have to open it.
Yeah you do  and all they do is just move a couple of things about.
Yeah.
Off you go 
Yeah.
You know what I was like when it was all  heavy.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Bristol Mecca they had a bloody bomb scare and we had to tip out
and they had all these great pads you know and I had all these maternity pads because I needed them you know I had to pad up and I had to and I felt so embarrassed 
I know some of these security men are worse than the bloody people who goes in and out there you know.
They knows the layout don't they?
Course they do.
That's it.
It's easier 
It's stupid
I could do it  if I had the face and I had the guts I could do it.
I don't no way
I could I know  about there if I really want to but no way I could do it.
Caroline went out there at Christmas and look at what she had.
Mm.
And she went back and back again till she got caught.
Mm.
Oh she got caught?
Hundreds of pounds
You see people that think they got cameras out there they can't see
I didn't know 
But they are there they've even got them in the warehouse
Have they?
Because he likes to see what's going on all the time.
Yeah
Well my sister  over there was two women.
For years they went on and on and on and everything they took and that was from eight o'clock in the morning was either from Marks and Spencers or British Home Stores.
Yeah good stuff yeah.
And our  had loads and loads of stuff and because it's it was red hot so she could fold it up and say 
Yeah that's it.
Yeah it was red hot 
they had beautiful clothes and they've gone on for years like that.
They had taxi in taxi out.
Anyway they got they got in the end and they
He run the corner shop isn't he ?
He goes up every year and nicks what he wants for Christmas for the kids.
And they'd wear different wigs every day.
Yeah
Different wigs.
For a couple of years on the run they've lost their dole cheque round about Christmas.
Oh yes they always lose their dole cheque very conveniently at Christmas.
Eh?
And they got to go down and get another one.
Yeah they do that same stroke every bloody Christmas  that Christmas 
There's no way.
I just couldn't.
No I couldn't  my money all the time.
I had the a couple of musical teddy bears put by.
I don't know whether you've seen them.
They're about this big and you squeeze its little paw and it plays a Christmas tune
Oh yeah.
And I said to Chris I'll have two of them.
One brown one one white one one each of the bears then.
And erm she said all right and I said what do I do with them and she said I'll put them down in the base at the back and I said all right so I went back on the shop floor just before I was coming out come out.
I went darling to one of the girls and she said yeah I said will you come with me and she said what's the matter?
I said I want to get my teddy bears out of the back.
She said go now to the electrical desk and you can pay for them when  no I don't want to do that and I made her come out with me and see I picked up those teddies in the bags and I went back in and put them by the electrical desk
Yes I see yes
I said that's how you got to do it and then I come round and pick them up when 
I mean when you think of those
She said oh what a fuss.
I said yeah but at least I know
There's no way I've touched anything else out of the cupboard you know?
And yet the stores is covered for any erm one who pinches and that.
But then erm they haven't got the guts to  things.
I mean if I
What do you want?
Although I wouldn't I wouldn't
If my kids was over here I'd have to flog something
Oh I know
I couldn't steal I couldn't steal 
I'd have to flog something
Now don't start because I'm going out.
I'm not.
You are.
Now David that's quite enough be a good boy 
Well don't worry about it Bet it'll be all right.
It's wonderful.
   

I don't know whether I'm coming or going.
I'm hungry.
I thought you were on nights this week?
Oh I am.
Doing two to ten Friday.
That's tomorrow.
Yeah.
Why you doing two to ten tomorrow?
Because she said she don't want to come in on nights.
She asked everybody and she said  will you come in on two to ten.
Mm.
They bounced up their little list
Oh Maggie!
We can depend on you to come in on Sunday can't we?
No.
Oh aye yeah no.
No.
She said it's double time.
Aye erm yeah.
I said couldn't care less if it's triple time I'm not coming in on a Sunday.
I said I see enough of this place all bleeding week I'm not coming in on a Sunday.
Oh dear!
He'd go bleeding mad 
Well I mean er
One day I have a lie in I mean I know I don't lay in there no more than eight
No but you know you don't have to worry about getting up have you?
Well I said I sort of trundle down the stairs and have me breakfast  
Well that's it that's it.
I said no bloody way am I working on a Sunday.
I said these daft buggers that come in and do it it's up to them.
I don't know I don't know.
I suppose if people wants to go to the shopping centres they .
I wouldn't go to the shops on Sunday.
No I wouldn't.
I wouldn't go on a Sunday.
I mean there's seven days in the week isn't there?
I mean I mean how can people afford to do it Bet?
I mean .
I mean to my mind if they're opening on a Sunday they should bring their prices down  because they're opening that extra day they're going to be taking extra revenue.
Yeah of course they are.
So they should be made to bring their prices down.
That is why they put that freeze on
That is why that man said you will not get any more special offers on a Fri Saturday night because they can't sell it on a Sunday so you used to see them selling things off on a Saturday five o'clock.
No more.
Because they're opening on a Sunday and hoping that you'll go in
That's it.
Mm
and buy.
So you won't be able to find out nothing 
You won't forget that.
And I reckon they'll carry on down to Christmas.
Well they reckon that the British Standard people are going to have
It's got to be tumbledried
it's going to be a dry day  get it out early and get it dry tomorrow.
Mm
What way do you think Clayton will come then?
What way?
Yeah.
I was going to lock the back door make sure that  down
Why?
Because  because she keeps on coming in.
to pay your money
Yeah.
Get a washing machine on the firm?
She said if you pay up  which isn't very much erm there's something in Littlewoods  and she's got money in her pocket and she's got a washing machine.
That's great.
will be paying her nowhere near as much.
That will be fine great brilliant.
That's what she said.
She said it's none of my business 
She wants washing machine 
Because if I can I'd rather get it off her than get it out of our club because then I can get some Christmas presents out of their lot.
Yeah.
Do you  or you can say to her is I don't know where it's gone or it doesn't work.
out of her catalogue.
Yeah.
Well they just went back and said they couldn't want something that much  maybe she's gone over her limit.
Yeah.
That's right.
gone over her limit and I'm not interested in her amount.
oh you turned it off.
No I haven't.
You have.
No I haven't.
The grill's gone out 
I haven't touched it.
The grill's gone out.
I haven't touched it love it's on full now.
Yeah.
It's on full and it's gone out.
Oh don't tell me fucking grill's packed up.
Oh no!
I don't believe it!
It's gone out.
It doesn't need to go out because I took that out.
This isn't right.
Yeah.
One two three four five.
Yeah.
That's the grill.
 

I don't know.
I can feel heat but  I don't know what it is?
The power is there cos you can hear it can't you?
Mm.
Try the top oven shall we?
Strange isn't it?
I wonder what it is then.
I don't know.
Something to do with that bottom light  the bloody payment was due yesterday or today whatever's the twenty sixth.
No there's nothing happening.
I can feel loads of heat but there's nothing happening 
Stupid.
Usually on the there five minutes, it's on all day isn't it?
 

It's come back on again.
Oh great 
It just went off.
That's strange.
Don't know what it was.
Never known it to go off before.
No I've never known it to go off before either.
Stupid.
I wouldn't worry about it anyway we're  Oh it's the football pools.
I don't think we've done it.
Billy!
Yeah.
You doing the football or not?
No 
Yes.
Here you are.
all you'd have had to get is all you'll have had to get is an element.
That's the thing that so easy with electric cookers is that you just have to buy the element.
So with that if one of them goes you just have to buy that as an element just slot it it comes  it's like a light bulb.
Oh I see  take it out and
Slots slots out and you slot another one in.
Oh I see.
It's a lot easier with gas.
Our mum's several times her rings has gone on her cooker she's had to buy a new element and she's switched to gas.
And you've switched over to electric.
I'd rather have  when it comes to safety 
Gas cookers are  
When it comes to safety when it comes to safety I would rather have an electric cooker.
But gas cooking is nice.
It tastes different.
It's nice.
But I suppose you've like  on I suppose you've got used to it.
Yeah.
Now you've got used to it.
I mean you know how to cook with it now.
I didn't have this one when you come here did I?
No 
Or did I?
You had the old bleeding white gas cooker the dangerous one.
It used to get 
Yeah that's right .
they said sorry I not going to let anyone use this.
Because we didn't know how long we've had it.
Oh.
Was it the council found it dangerous?
Yeah the gas man weren't it?
Yeah.
He said it's dangerous.
Yeah he said I should get my husband to divorce it and chuck it
You've had this what about two years now?
It's got to be.
Mm.
She was saying four years four years and I said I've not had it four years 
I should say about two years.
Because you had the old white one when I came here.
And it was just over four years ago that I came here.
That's right.
Four years and two months ago or a few months  but the gas man sort of found it dangerous.
he got it taken out to the back garden isn't it?
Didn't you have  or something?
I can't remember whether 
Dangerous wasn't it?
Yeah.
It really was dangerous.
I remember this one being delivered.
Yeah.
And you said ooh I not going to get used to this.

It comes to you so easily you know.
I still don't know  don't know which is the top grill the oven the top oven the bottom oven.

Oh I 
It's half past eight we'd better chase it up.
myself.
Into Neighbours again?
bank .
I'm not allowed to touch it.
Why?
Because someone in America is vegetarian.
Yeah?
And when that girl becomes vegetarian mix about and the other one  she's vegetarian still and she said she's not coming back in this house.
She said it's nonsense.
It's good for them though.
Yeah but what they've what they've done  but what one wants to do is not  is not bad for them one little bit.
It's good for them.
That's like what's her name down the  down there.
She's vegetarian three months ago er three years ago.
But they worked out in three years she's put on seven stone because she eats .
She eats loads and loads and loads of cheese.
She buys four pounds of cheese a week.
 
And she eats a load of cheese 
Yeah but  if she was proper vegetarian she wouldn't eat cheese.
Well if she was a vegan she wouldn't eat cheese.
She can't eat cheese if you're a vegan.
That's what James is.
He's a prat 
You can't eat no animal fat at all 
Yeah 
You've got the sou I reckon you've still got to have er get your protein.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah but she Karen  won't eat chicken.
Chicken and fish.
and fish .
It's the only stuff they'll eat.
No meat at all chicken and er fish .
Do you know the reason why it's not?
It's to do with red meat it's blood isn't it?
Blood's red.
That's right isn't it?
You can't you can't see no blood in chicken you can't see no blood in fish.
No.
They've got this little thing in their head if it's not got blood in it no red blood they can eat it.
It looks like it's a really deep cut by looking at it now.
It's sort of like open there.
All it was first of all was a little graze on top of the skin.
Mm.
Because where I was making boxes it was pulling the skin and was torn apart wasn't it?
Yeah it kept going there all the time.
They do though don't it?
So the other day last week I was bleeding 
Was you?
Yeah I cut myself.
And erm the next day I had er it was all white there
Was it?
and I took every little last bit out.
But I never noticed it er
Serious.
It was not funny because what I did.
I was cleaning out knives and the metal thing that goes over the knives there was something there and it was a nail and I just pushed and I caught it.
So I took a nick out of my finger and ended up with  from the top of my finger.
Mm.
Nasty.
blood enough goes over my fingers  cut his thumb and and all he did was just sort of bathed it put  on it.
It was a deep cut  and ended up  
 
And a good cover up job.
It didn't make it heal just good stuff  
And she was mhm
Mm.
Yeah!
She was had on a full stomach.
She had to do it before she ate anything.
She said most of it was it wasn't the actual looking at the hole it was that she was hurting him  pushing it in.
Mm.
And it weren't hurting him at all but it was making her feel sick thinking that she was hurting him like.
Dunno.
He just won't go.
It being her first child .
I don't know what I'd be like.
And he sleeps in a normal bed.
Do he?
Yes.
That's good for a baby.
He sleeps in a normal bed all right.
She was packing his stuff and I was bringing him upstairs to his room like away from her like.
Like he knows she's in the house and he wants to go wherever she goes.
But if she's not in the house it doesn't worry him.
If he knows she's not there.
So I can go upstairs and put him in his rocking chair.
rocking chair.
Well there's not a lot I said to her does he sleep in that?
It's a full size single bed?
And she said yeah.
I said bloody hell!
I never knew a child of one could sleep in a normal size bed.
cot  yeah.
Well no.
She must leave his door shut.
She's bound to isn't is?
She puts on the alarm like one of those baby alarms.
stairs isn't it?
That's it.
Got to be.
And she's got to go downstairs to the kitchen.
He was trying to go upstairs last night cos she was upstairs and I wouldn't let him.
You do think  those bloody stairs
As soon as she was upstairs.
He knew that she was up there  I let him sort of try and climb up.
Well he climbed up the bloody first stair.
Like he was behind er I never held him I was behind him like you know well it gives his legs a bit more like movement.
Who's that who was on the telephone?
It won't be long now before it's off.
That'll be it?
she'll have to keep an eye on him then.
Yes, hard work isn't it?
You should have seen him he climbed on top of a box last night to get to the telly.
Did he?
Pardon me
He won't listen to  when she was saying get down.
He wouldn't listen to her like sod you.
Do you pull the curtains?
Mm.
on TV.
He loves putting his getting his hands in your mouth and pulling your teeth.
He loves that.
Mm.
Does he?
your teeth.
And he likes the fridge magnets.
He'll sit there on the floor with them and play with the magnets.
He chucks them off and puts them back on again.
Very intelligent little baby isn't he?
Mm.
And he likes chucking things on the ground.

Oh don't talk to me.
included there are about ten.
Ann's got a  head on ain't she?
Why?
Her sister  I think put her .
Was moaning about she had to buy three Christmas presents and she only got two kids  So Ann turned round and said oh you're fucking well mad I got to buy five presents and I've only got two kids.
And she said not only that whenever my kids babysit for you you only give em a fiver each.
Oh she had to buy five presents and she only had two kids.
That's right.
And Ann said well if you going to fucking be like that don't bother to buy my kids anything.
I won't buy your kids anything.
Yeah.
She says and I will spent that extra couple of quid on my kids.
So  said if you're going to be like that be like that.
So she said don't you fucking worry I am.
Yeah.
She said bollocks on you lot for Christmas.
I ain't buying nothing.
Oh she said oh you spent money on the shirts for the kids.
That's it you can't  these days 
The kids come first isn't it ?
Well they were going with their  at the beginning of the year up for register and they're catching up on it now.
Oh.
That's it.
I mean we've got kids and the kids got to come first and the adults come second 
like Ann said .
It's all right for them because their kids can go on holiday with them so they've got no problems.
But because their kids can't go abroad  then they get a letter through to say like you know they are going on camp would they be interested.
Of course Ann sends off and says yeah.
But that's three hundred pounds for them to fit the bill.
Oh yeah!
Hundred and fifty pound each.
That's a fortnight mind.
Yeah.
And that's everything.
That's all their spending money involved and their day trips off the lot.
She's got no worries.
Her and her old man stays at home and has a fortnight together.
Then they go at camping school or whatever wherever the school's going.
The kids do that.
And then they go on holiday with Ann and the old man.
And when they go on holiday with Ann and the old man they used to get through a hundred pounds a day and they go for a week.
That's seven hundred pounds like sometimes more.
But she said I don't mind because I would like to take my boat but I can't.
When we went abroad I know we've spent three or four grand when we're over there with the holiday as well like you know.
She said so it's got to be done really she said and I feel so sorry for them she says because even when they get older they still won't be able to go abroad.
Yeah.
Well I mean I don't see why they 
And they've had so many operations 
I can't see why they can't go on a camping holiday in France.
I mean they can go on the ferry.
Take the car out there.
They've got their own car.
Yeah but they go to  somewhere bloody they go to the same place every year and they have a real good time.
And she says might just as well be with the kids like so.
She ain't really worried.
She says the only trouble is when they get older
I mean I am  I mean I'm quite surprised that your floor.
Whatever floor that Ann's been on hasn't done something like put some money in so that they can take em somewhere else something like over in France or something like that.
She wouldn't accept it .
She's not that type is she ?
She'd say don't be silly .
Simple isn't she?
and they don't want nothing for their kids.
She puts them first don't she?
Oh yeah.
Whatever they want they gets.
my darling please?
She bought them a telly.
I reckon they should have next year a long weekend 
Purple  
All that money in your pocket haven't you?
Let's have a look .
There covers 
Even if they all go in bed and breakfast and take them two kids to Euro Disney.
She erm  little T V each.
It was T V between them.
So many hours and so many nights and .
But I would have bought them one each.
Yeah.
But they're only having one big present each this year.
And that's it.
That's it.
Yeah .
 
Yeah I know.
I'd go mad.
She said that fucking last year I said.
What's the girl ?
No.
Boy thirteen and a girl eleven.
Oh.
Or twelve that's either two years or a year between them.
And don't fight.
No?
Of course boy and a girl don't 
They only argue.
They don't fight they only argue but they can't fight cause of their ears.
And I think the boy suffers from asthma as well.
Well there you are.
It's different with a boy and a girl cos
You got your washing out mind you.
Because when
You been out there?
Her boy went out on this work experience thing for his school like.
He must be older than thirteen.
He must be fourteen .
He must be fourteen hmm .
Yeah.
Anyway they paid him I told you didn't I?
They paid him and the reason they ain't going to have nobody back there any more back to this firm cos  safety rules.
And erm she was saying that when he was there a bloke come round start giving them a little verbal.
She'd never had nothing in his ears to protect his ears.
So he's shouting it the boy like.
And of course the old man was there and he come over and grabbed the bloke by the throat and he said don't you ever shout at my son like that again.
Course he was frightened to death weren't he .
And he said well he should know better than to  blah blah blah
Hmm
He said my son's fucking deaf you idiot.
Well well that is why he don't need to put anything in his ears.
Because he can't hear nothing stupid.
Well he's still have to put it in his ears.
You're going to put your fucking eyes out.
Hmm.
I bet he got all upset.
Well everybody knew when they're up.
daft anyway and nine times out of ten you've got to look at him and speak to him and that because he can't understand and er bloke gave him the verbal.
He was nearly crying wasn't he.
Ah!
We didn't know what to say.
It's got to be tumble dried.
He didn't know he had to give him a little verbal back.
It's already  
What about the football?
my white shirt?
You picked Liverpool?
Yeah.
Put it on then.
Turn the tape off.
And the day that he left.
Is it finished?
No it's not finished.
It's just that you're going to get that on.
Yeah do you know those chocolates you had.
How much were they Julie?
One pound nine pence some at pence 
Was it two pounds summat three pounds summat?
Contrast.
Contrast.
I got you a single like a small box 
Single didn't you ?
And they had a double box for three pounds six or something and there are what at Woolies they're about three fifty six so you're saving fifty P.
Oh not a lot .
But still 
But you're saving something.
You save fifty P.
I mean if you'd rather get them if you'd rather save fifty P.
You'd get them in there wouldn't ya?
Well yeah I suppose so
Rather than get them in .
Yeah if you want to save yeah yeah.
Oh well.
I mean if you don't get much of an item off an item you'd know that is well in date.
Hmm Hmm.
If it's that cheap
It's either that or there's not a lot about.
If there's not a lot there then they won't put the price tags down.
But if they're got a lot they will.
Well I mean well I don't mean  you'll sort it out yourself.
But there ain't nothing on that  pack.
Hmm.
And luckily enough
I don't  bloody know.
So when I've been fussing about in there 
What are they called?
Erm
I heard it when I come in didn't I?
Yeah.
isn't it.
It begins with a B.
You can see the packet there orange packet.
Yeah I can see it  packet.
Yeah  
Ah!
I don't like them.
And chocolates all round like.
I'd like  we had more Cadbury's in Birmingham once.
I'm going back years.
I'm going back a bit there .
Well they had tea coffee and sandwiches cakes.
They had fruit juices for kids .
Now I got one lot of fruit juices and I said to  go and get some more  and there were six empty on the thing then I chucked them in and then there were another six empty like.
I suppose you can get can you get so many up  you can in a lot of places can't you?
No I know you used to have a price.
But it worked out that they spent twenty thousand pounds on letting families go round for these three weeks.
It would be better to
they didn't have the machinery like you got.
No it was all hands all done by hand no automation.
Yeah yeah.
And the villages all round there are pretty out there.
Ours ours can't be done automated.
That's right.
You can't have a computer put the eggs in the pans because it's got to be it's got to be done manually by a worker.
Yeah but chocolate's got so expens 
My dad's  he didn't understand before he seen the mini eggs why they're so dear.
There's a lot of work there.
It takes thirty two hours before they can be packed.
They got to be stored for thirty two hours.
It takes so long.
So basically all they're saying it takes thirty two hours to do one egg.
Yeah.
As with Double Decker it can take the most two hours Crunchie takes the most two hours 
As with Crunchie  are there no Crunchies there now?
Yeah.
There were Crunchies yesterday.
No no it weren't yesterday.
Huh?
packs 
What packs of Crunchies?
Loose one you mean?
No I went Thursday.
No.
I went.
There weren't any loose one.
Thursday morning there was packs of Crunchies
No I don't
I likes a Crunchie.
I don't mind a Crunchie.
It's light isn't it?
It doesn't stick in your gob 
I likes a Crunchie 
I's eat all the chocolate first and the inside afterwards
More than that now though.
Oh aye.
Yeah but you can buy it 
You could buy it in a penny packet bloody great 
I used to get a lot of it when I was in
And it used to be dark brown.
It used to be darker than  bloody .
They made it different then didn't they?
Mm.
It's bloody mass produced now isn't it?
So before my work out this morning I said to Joe he's in the bathroom.
Done Joe's bedroom and er the Hoover was up there the dusters was up there so I thought shall I shall I.
No I've got dinner before one and I thought well
Well 
properly 
with Crunchie right?
They set on a big conveyor belt.
There's got to be about eight foot wide and er 
I'd seen that being done on the telly the other night.
A hundred and fifty degrees C that's what it comes out at.
Right and it goes like these great funnels spread it  Now as it goes down it gets caught down.
And when it gets cut.
It's got cut like boiling hot oil a laser of oil.
Oh oh.
And we got told now I didn't know this.
We got told that that laser of oil can cut through concrete just like that.
Just as quick as it goes through a Crunchie.
Bloody hell.
So they have so much problems with it like they'll never ever experiment with that again.
They'll keep it for Crunchie but never use it for anything else again because they've had so much trouble with it.
Blimey!
Charles  with Christmas presents.
Oh did you?
I had to give him his paper and his 
Well.

We went up Friday.
Now the bloody  have you ever ?
Think we'll have a suggestion box.
They had a kids party, a game.
Where the smokers' end is.
Yeah.
Now why do they have kids parties where there's smokers?smoking with children.
Yeah but I wouldn't want a kids party round there with all that ooh bloody going on.
Ooh it was terrible.
The music was so loud  
I don't like  
Why don't they have it right down there at that end where there's no smoking and the little children would be right out of the way.
 
Well yeah.
They've got a room there haven't they they can have?
But there's the bloody place and on a Friday night I thought ooh bloody .
shop Sunday?
No.
I ain't shopping on a Sunday.
But you don't need shopping on a Sunday do you?
Well I wouldn't go to the shop on Sunday anyway.
I just don't 
No I never.
like shopping on Sundays .
Nothing religious about it.
No but it's 
Bu , I, it's a shame that I 
Six days shalt thou labour.
The sh the shops that are shut on a Sunday and it's a day 
I think it's the lord's day and I'm not  
Well it's a day of rest.
Yes it's a day of rest  
Not shopping.
I I just  don't
I'd rather come and borrow.
Say Bet  I've gotta have some sugar.
And I don't never do that cos I don't like doing it.
But I would.
Rather than go round the shops.
Well yeah.
I can't see no sense in it.
No.
I wouldn't go shopping  on a Sunday.
N , that is not on religious grounds either that is because I just  think that they work six days they should have a day off anyway.
That's bloody greed half of it.
Oh  unions split  Sundays off.
I think you can only spend your money once.
Course you can.
So if they're gonna go up there on a Sunday they ain't gonna go up there on another day.
You can only 
Well 
spend your money once and that's it.
So if you go Sundays you ain't gonna go Mondays or Tuesdays  
No.
That's right.
Yeah but it's a flash in the pan.
It'll suddenly die down.
They'll say well it ain't worth opening we .
