Looks like black dresses are going out slightly more.
.
It's a bit further down I think.
.
They said they might be able to get before us though, didn't they?
Penny went shopping with Rowan, into one of those very expensive boutiques shops, yeah, and between them they bought this dress, and when they got it home, Rowan's mother wouldn't let her have it because it was too revealing and so Penny was stuck with it and then her mother wouldn't let her have it either, but the shop wouldn't refund, it would only give them credit  so she's got all this money to spend in the shop .
This is quite nice, an anorak isn't it?
Yes.
With a hood, yes that's nice  
I like it 
I don't know.
No 
Oh yes, that's the one I think.
Sandy, that's what it was , it's a twelve.
Yes, that's it, mm .
They got it yesterday, oh it's gone up, no it's not the same one, they haven't got that one after all .
That's  .
That's a different one isn't it?
That's the one.
I think I tried on a ten didn't I?
It was a bit too small wasn't it?
Was it? mm.
A hundred and forty nine, that was the one, that was the one that she had.
Try some more on let me have a look at them.
Just erm, does it look daft?.
she didn't want a long one.
No, wanna try that do you?
Yeah, but she has tried it before.
Yeah, it was awful.
She's, it was just erm, can we have the twelve, try the twelve  that's only a ten, does it, does .
We, do we try that one as well?
We tried one like that didn't we?.
Yes, that would , yes we did.
What's that one, was that .
That's right , yes, zip the hood that'll go over
Let me see it on you.
Wanted to wear .
Go on, try them on.
.
The trouble with  when you see one and like the sizes there are suppose to get it, because they go so quickly.
Yeah, that's right.
This time of the year and that .
You don't know that .
.
Why, why don't you take it off?
I'll try, will I  .
.
I've got three quarters length underneath so they'll go up any way.
 

Just too small look the ten.
Yes, yes it is.
Yeah it is.
Yeah, there's no doubt about that, erm, well that was, that was the one that your stile that you liked wasn't it?
Let's try  .
Yeah.
Ah, that's the only one we have left in that  
There's one in the window I'm just gonna have a look, cos I never had noticed when I came in this morning
What was in the window.
Okay, that's quite nice, yeah that is quite nice, I like that.
I think that's a bit more mod really, thing is this is more the sort you had isn't it?
I quite like that one at the end as well.
The reddy one.
The gi , that one hanging up.
Yes, that's short you see, isn't it again?
That's the same  as the
Yeah, but that's very short that is.
Yeah I'm 
.
don't say much.
You'd like the duffel coat  won't you, no, oh well,if you don't like it.
Don't particularly like the red either,
Well I mean, yes I think that 
.
Two hundred and ninety nine, that one there .
Do you like that one  .
That's longer
.
Is a twelve in that?
You have one, yes that's nice  nice colours.
Is it real?
Yeah, I tell you what looks  .
.
It looks nice in a ten but that's all 
.
Just want to try on  .
It is just because of your hair.
And of course it's a practical length, but there you are you've got to like it.
Yeah,.
I like this better than that duffel coat one .
The other one .
The thing about it is, is a classic style .
That's beautiful on you, that's the one to have  .
It's not going to date.
It's not a fashion jacket,
No.
whereas, erm, the shorter ones tend to be
Beautiful
fashionable.
These are things that will, will have for years.
Rachel I think that's the 
Can I ask if
Do you like it better than
Yeah, that's beautiful on you, isn't it?
How much is it?
Two hundred and ninety nine.

It's, it's like the one aunty Lynne had and I, I bought for aunty Lynne, years ago, that I still got in the cupboard you know.
I wore it, all it was lovely,.
What's that, the other one was it?
That's the other ten.
You can try the other ten if you want to be absolutely sure about it, cos it's, you know, look at the length of that one as well, I mean
She's going to Russia for a week in February of all times and we want to have something really warm .
So you won't to have something really warm .
Beautiful buttons.
Well .
You can do that right up, right, you can turn the neck up, now this one here

.
.
.
Okay .
You sure?

Beautiful, yeah, you convinced yourself.
Yeah.
I'm sure she has, she couldn't hesitate about that.
.
The colouring to the hair, I mean I've got it in another colour , but I, I think it

It's advisable to put it on before you wear the coat, what 
Right ,
you do is hang it over on the clothes line, stand back a few inches, just give it an even spray ,
yeah ,
you only do it the once unless you have the coat cleaned
right

It's like a scotch guard for furniture really.
yeah, it, it stops stains penetrating the skin
Right.
that's what it is
Ah, yes.
and the  that we show you here  tells you all about it, how to look after it and everything
Yeah.
