And it's fairly easy  
Oh!

Yes, I er, I went down and told them but they haven't pu they haven't put it back in.
Anyway, Mary will have a sense of authority, she's going to

Or like that when they  
Well there won't be anybody

I rang Cathy from Market Drayton
Oh yes Mary.
I put it on the   machine  and I didn't think she would  she'd get over just for the meeting at night, but I did.
And I rang Je 
Oh!
Jenny and Dave  passed it on to them 
Yeah.
for Mr and Mrs , so
Yeah.
whether or not they do make it.
Er 
Oh yeah!
but I did say seven
Yeah.

She understands.
Oh yes, it was at the end wasn't it?
Well we just sort of sat down and said   anything to eat!
Anything to eat !
Yeah.
Just let me get  
Did most of them that  is there ?
The one in blue.
But my Edna couldn't get over the fact that sh she'd gone through all that
Yeah.
and stayed till the end of the party!
Yeah, but when I took her the toilet she wanted to go toilet 
Yeah.
she says,I'm sure they're gonna  .
I said 
Yeah.
well when you get back you tell me.
Mm.
Is this the ones that were ?
Yeah, but I mean, yeah.
Yeah!
Her heart stopped.
I took her the toilet she wanted to wash her face.
That's right!
She stopped breathing!
And er 
Well who got her going, you?
Yes, us and Sandra!
And then 
going  whoo whoo  I said, I think the heart's still going!
I was quickly going whoo whoo!
Good Lord!
And then her heart would go 
I mean I  
erm  how do you erm  bandage the foot!
And me and him started laughing and had to know what it was .
Well I, and she didn't ?
It's 
Yeah.
surprising what er 
We th we rang nine nine nine 
!
they sent er  two paramedics.
Oh stupid!
I wouldn't have never have known 
Erm 
She had erm  er 
and er 
angina  but she takes this spray
Oh!
Doesn't she 
Yeah.
 
not tablets.
Me I mean she takes it when she's er 
does it.
See I wanted to take that.
bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it doesn't go that far.
And she said every time she takes it 
 
makes her ill.
Looks bad doesn't it?
No.
The father has the same 
Mm.
and he stopped 
Yeah.
taking it cos it did the same thing.
Mind you,
Oh yeah.
Cos it makes her so ill!
You can er, get that 
Why doesn't she go the doctors?
And th then she was saying well we told her 
That's it!
to go.
 
Stupid !
So er 
Well it's terrifying for us!
What a responsibility for you!
Well, I was told somebody that there was a lady not feeling very well.
So I went across and she was sitting by the fire exit behind the piano  and er, I said what's up?
She said well, I've had my medicine I'm not too good and I feel a bit 
Oh thank you very much!
then sh she says I've been .
Having, having looked at her
Yeah.
and she was beginning to 
Four or five of these.
Yeah.
hyperventilate.
Yeah.
She was panicking and the more she panicked the more she was 
Yes.
gasping!
Yeah!
The more she was sucking in, and she says I'm going!
Well fortunately, for me she wasn't what I call a big lady
Mm.
so I put her on the floor, lifted her feet up to get the blood  back to her head 
Yeah.
and  she to she took about three minutes before she opened her eyes and came round.
And then sh Elizabeth had come over by then  and I said it's  it's in her bag, so we had a look at it and her friend said it's for angina, it always makes her ill!
Then we got her up and she said I'm going to be sick  so I said don't worry about it.
But we undid the fire door, which was fortunate we were by it and I said look I'll take you outside the fresh air might revive you.
Mhm.
So Elizabeth was about to get her onto the  to carry her out,she said nice and gently  and picked her up and taken her outside !
 
We sat her out on the chair, put her head between her knees  and said look, take some big deep breaths and if you're sick don't worry about it, you'll be alright.
Next thing she says, I feel funny!
Oh I'm going she says!
And the ne that was it!
Just gone!
And she stopped breathing!
And I thought  
What outside?
Cos 
Yeah.
I laid her on the conc you know, like the, the step out 
Oh God!
at the back we la 
Yeah.
we laid her on the step and I said to Elizabeth she's stopped breathing!
Elizabeth going, stopped, oh oh oh!
She has!
Well er
Good job sh you was still 
we sat there 
there.
well, we started this mouth to mouth and Elizabeth says I'll and I'll put, I said I think her heart's going, but  I mean, to me it means anything  to get her going.
Mm!
Anyway, we kept blowing in, and we must have been doing mouth to mouth for about eighteen  er about a mi a minute and a half.
Really?
She suddenly, Elizabeth  there's her one arm after she pressed down on her dress and then she goes, ooh!
That's it, she's going!
We rolled her on the side
and she, she was very shallow breath
Mm.
like  oh we talked to her and then we said, don't worry ambulance is coming.
Just like, she went berserk!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going!
We had to promise she wouldn't go.
That's it, they wouldn't go.
Anyway, when the ambulance men came  we made them a cup of tea, cos they said they a they'd have been that busy they haven't had a break!
Oh!
So we made them a cup of tea and hopefully they were going to talk her into it.
And they said, if she doesn't go   responsibility that we can accept and then  she's had the chance to go.
Yeah!
That's right.
Yeah, they .
And she should have gone.
Yeah well,sh when she went on Thursday she said   I should have gone .
Yeah.
I said, well when you go back .
Yeah well
Cos really, I mean an E C G might have guaranteed some .
Yeah.
Well I think more than anything if they'd have seen the state she was in after she'd had this 
Yeah.
drug, they could have probably kept her in, stabilized her on a new one
Yeah.
and then kept 
Yeah.
her on the new ones.
And she needs something.
Yeah.
Yeah I know.
I mean you shouldn't be feeling like, I mean  my mum had angina and my husband had angina 
 
but no,th the medicine never affected her like that!
Well it did on my dad.
This new spray apparently
Oh well , I've had 
does give them  
no complaints about the er 
Terrible innit!
It's the  tri-nitrate, you know.
The glycerine tri- nitrate.
Yeah.
Yep.
How it affected them.
Now I know one or two people who said they've had such terrible headaches
You're not gonna cook another 
Yeah?
it's really 
I 
hot!
Yeah.
Oh 
Sometimes Graham had a headache 
This spray gives a headache most of time.
That's the  
Had your father had the pains in his chest 
Yeah.
and the terrible thumping headache as well?
Yeah.
Oh dear!
You see, a lot of people are saying that they should take 
Ooh I was frightened!
Well I don't think I can feel like  I suppose that were Victoria wasn't it, ringing nine nine nine they forgot to ask 
Mm.
I know.
See, she stopped breathing!
Yeah.
And they were ages out 
Yeah.
in  
 
Anthony came through the corridors and say is Elizabeth there and  was on 
One, two, three, four, five, six,.
the floor and said, oh!
And sort of came away  much to say  thought it was a joke, like 
Yeah.
you know.
Cos we didn't want  the four,th the ladies that she was with  they knew what was happening but nobody else knew
No!
No.
But what, I mean, why they have 
I thought you had five of them, I didn't realize.
You know, I didn't know what to do with her Pat 
 
she !
I thought perhaps she had too much to drink.
No.
Cos a gentlemen who'd come from 
Or bra brain damage anything!
there and  Grange, and he's had a bit to drink, he wasn't drunk, but 
But she's a nice lady!
apparently he's argumentative.
Oh yeah.
He'd said something to this lady and under normal circumstances he would not a she wouldn't have said anything
Ooh sorry Margaret!
but
It's gone on.
Oh it's alright, don't worry.
she did.
Alright.
And it was upset of answering 
Yeah.
him back.
Oh!
He argued back with her  and 
Yeah.
she just 
Yeah.
panicked!
Yeah.
It was the argument that did it.
Yeah.
It did.
Oh!
And I think it's, it's .
Well it doesn't do you any good.
It's that little man.
Is that the little man?
Yes I I know.
Yeah.
Yeah, him.
But it were quite  
They were telling him he'd had enough drink and stop 
Yeah.
 
being a piggy!
 
Yeah.
Yeah.
But 
He is argumentative.
when she went we oh he is!
It's what he said!
And somebody's car was actually 
She was a bit troublesome.
I doubt 
What 
if it's her.
She   really that's .
She is a bit like that int she?
This is the one that that bloke
Yeah!
and these all came off the same train.
I thought 
Ah!
Well
this lady was one who was  arguing with him as well.
Eh!
Will you stop  trying to 
Yes.
blame someone now!
All those calories, and eh!
I couldn't really  
She really  
One Crunchie and it's alright.
Yeah.
Well
You know, how the 
do you know the lady 
Yeah.
that came in the wheelchair but her husband didn't come?
He ca they'd gone to pick them up
Yeah.
and, he'd got her up and got her ready and sent her out and said he wouldn't come.
And they were all saying  oh but he's always like that!
Well, on reflection, we actually said afterwards  perhaps he wanted a day off.
Yes.
If she was 
Yes!
in a wheelchair
Yeah.
and she was well in her seventies!
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He probably thought that Christmas day, even if he wasn't with her would be a godsend 
Go Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
if he could have a day's peace.
Yeah!
 
And I actually spoke to Jenny about it
Yeah.
and saying, what do you think cos  of all the qualified ones at least she  cos she worked on the elderly side.
Right.
Yeah.
She said, I think, you'd be better off leaving him a if he doesn't want to come
Yes.
leave him alone.
Leave him alone, yeah 
And 
that's right.
they wouldn't let her sit with them because they said oh well, she's  she's you know, leave her with them, and it was that little lad
Yeah.
and the next one  that woman that, this one that you 
Yeah.
were saying
Aha.
was complaining about him, and about this other woman so I think 
That's right.
the lad's got
Yeah.
they never have a good word to say for each other!
No, that was it, you know!
 
But finally
Well
some old people are like that
That reminds me, have you said anything ?
And where she's moved to
She doesn't like it.
Oh!
And she says, they are not real friends!
No.
Oh!
So there you are, another saga!
An hour before it she was crying to Theresa.
Er
Who was?
which, this one?
The one that passed out.
Yeah.
Saying that she'd had 
Oh I see, yeah.
she doesn't like where she's been moved to because of her ill health.
She had 
Yeah.
to move.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She doesn't 
She would 
like it and she turned round and she says they're not real friends.
Yeah.
And 
Ah!
But she went to see that .
Now did you that other woman, a younger woman
Erm
Constance.
I don't know, is she?
Oh yes!
Oh yeah!
And all on her 
She's always playing with that 
own!
I know.
But she's a tough one!
She's the one 
 
with the
Yes.
She looks as if she's 
Yeah.
trouble!
With her table 
She was, she had a pocket full 
Yes.
of anti-depressant pills 
That's right.
Valium
Well I saw her 
barbiturates.
standing in the entrance of the 
Yeah.
canteen, and I said to her, are you alright?
She said I'm trying to lose my temper!
So I thought, oh crikey!
I'll leave her alone!
Yeah !
 
Cos she just 
 
sat on her own didn't she?
Yeah.
And she had a
But she wasn't any trouble though.
No, but she 
No.
sat on her own, Anthony came 
Are you sure?
to me and said, ah!
Mum that lady's crying!
I said, leave her alone, she's alright, I said, she's happy like she's like that.
And then somebody else came and said she was er  I think 
Mm.
it was young Victoria
Yeah.
I said, ooh, I said, she's alright on her own, I said she's quite happy, you know
Yeah.
crying into her beer and what have you.
Oh yeah.
And she was!
Yeah!
Well that's right!
I hope I never  like that!
Yeah!
She wasn't very tired Marg.
And she'd had a drink, and a good cry, she'd had 
 
a good time.
Yeah!
There's her dad?
Yeah.
There's, there's Helen's dad.
Oh!
Does he?
Yeah.
Your, your husband?
Yeah.
Oh!
But, but sh 
Oh!
 
but you re you re you realize, and I don't suppose would, that she's a psychiatric patient, to a certain degree.
Well whoever, whoever
Yeah !
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well he does, sometimes she sa did she say him or did she say 
No, she says your dad keeps trying, er kee when I see your dad down the town   and try and 
Well he doesn't know who's, his dad is.
Well perhaps, perhaps the   so and so, so told me.
I guess she's .
Oh I see!
I see.
Oh what a shame!
Oh!
Well I can't remember, that's what she said  
Yeah well 
Well  we did have a letter off erm  Good Neighbours  through the lady who also came to sing, cos I know her 
Yeah.
of old
Yeah.
to say  you know, to thank us
been looking forward when I come and
She was very good wasn't she?
Erm, yes.
Erm, actually on  reflection, having seen the bit of disaster that occurred because erm  unfortunately Freda didn't get the phone call until early Christmas day morning  off her daughter, to say that instead of them coming up to here to see them  that something had happened in London, could they go down to her, so she was prepared to do us a half an hour at  half past one  and then she was going to drive to London!
I said, I think you better go before you  don't worry about the party.
No.
And that was a sort of a last minute  cancellation, and I had to really persuade her to go.
And we realized on reflection, had  Freda have not volunteered early enough, another lady who used to work  at the station  played,u plays for Nigel when he does his gigs.
Mm.
And she's on her own, and  so next year
She is
they're coming back again 
 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she's  
Yeah.
It's coming back again thi na na time next year, this year 
This year.

And 
Yeah.
they're going to bring Darlene with them.
Oh good!
It's only three hundred and sixty days to go!
harder this year having that .
Boring!
Boring!
Boring!
Boring!
Well, well it, it 
 
did even itself out.
 
Yeah.
It did even itself 
Yeah.
out.
Yeah.
And, I mean, actually on Christmas day we lost about ten people who've been found ill.
Yeah.
I mean one lady was found wandering in the street!
And fortunately, it was, it was one of the councillors, well they phoned   that was meant to pick her up, and found her walking the street!
Oh!
Her husband had been taken into hospital and she was waiting for her son to come and pick her up at half past twelve, this was at half past ten in morning!
No it wasn't in the morning.
Now tha that's the Good Neighbours' officer.
But and er   all the same.
And she erm  well  and she sat with him 
How did it go?

Yeah.
half an hour talking to her.
But of course,

Nigel got them all up before they even said too much.
 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shall I play my violin?
Yeah.
No.
He loves taking his violin.
He he played his violin, he got up, and actually there was erm  the dad,th the mum, she sang with them, is tha was that who it was?
The 
Who?
the lady who was singing with them was that 
Oh yeah!
Victoria, her mum?
Well yeah.
That's her mum.
She's another so er  light operatic singer.
She got up and then when it came round to singing Jerusalem and  Edie was put out at not singing Jerusalem, this is another one off the psychiatric list and Pat goes
so she got up as well.
And he played his violin as well so  and actually what Nigel had wanted was to get a little choral group so we 
Yes.
could all sing.
Mm.
And then what  what was Jimmy offered the day after?
But some ninety twenties song sheets with all the old time 
Oh!
singers on!
Right!
This is what you want.
So 
then he said he was getting them copied ready for th 
Yeah.
another year.
Oh yeah.
They'll want something, yeah.
But, when Nigel comes next year he'll bring Eileen and I think that under circumstances I think if we say well come for about quarter to two.
Yeah.
Mary would have come and helped at dinner time but she thought  that, well it would be alright, you know, and 
Yeah.
we didn't  need anyone.
Said if you'd have come early !
Who was Nigel?
That was the lad who sang  
Yeah, but wha who is he?
Well, he lives in 
Next to me.
Just next 
er 
to me.
this lady who's secretary  
sit in Sandra's 
Yeah.
chair.
?
Yeah.
Yeah, well she used to work at the station in the offices.
I've known her for twenty odd years!
Jimmy knows this Nigel.
He's goes up the Cricketers.
I keep thinking 
Oh he does.
Mm mm.
if we could, I keep thinking about your lunch 
I said 
problems.
Pardon?
I keep thinking about your lunch er, opportunities.
Why what do you mean?
Well, I was telling you  or are they alright?
Well no, we're alright in the mornings.
Right.
Yeah, we're okay.
I know we were at one point.
Yes.
Yeah, we're okay for help int mornings.
And how long have you been going now?
Er, just over a year.
Started before  last Christmas.
Mm mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's great.
It's dead on.
Supposing you don't have any of the ones 
And how many did you want?
you talked about a minute ago and do a  a  for them.
After one of the Christmas parties?
Er was it  that wasn't a person was it?
No.
No.
But, there was a reorganization at Cortilles before you went
Oh yeah?
Oh.
and, they asked us did we want to take over the dinners  because 
Oh!
it was being reorganized and the lady who did it couldn't do it any more and would one of us like to take the 
Oh!
organization on?
And I said well, I'm sorry to say that we're a bit too busy in the 
Mm mm.
week to to  take it on.
 

I mean, the same goes when the when they seem to be organizing something that 
Yeah.
runs well  it's so easy for other groups to, to try and get you to help them out.
If you do 
Yeah.
But, if you get involved you end up  either taking over
Yeah.
or not doing what you set out to do.
So it's 
Yeah.
best off not doing any of it.
No you have to say  cos I 
You've got to choose what you 
cos I won't take any more on.
No.
Not if involves this weekend.
Their  club  Wednesday afternoons, the children, asked the children  a bit of reading.
And they have their lunch and come out Tuesday.
Mm.
And I 
Yeah.
and I won't take anything else on.
No.
Yeah.
Well I mean that when we start organization  and I am on, I'm on Cortille and on the committee and they wanted me to take over the Vice Chairman and I said no way.
Because I mean  we've helped you with this  and helping with that anyway.
I mean, I 
Yeah.
haven't got involved in like taking friends and organizing and baking cakes and that sort of thing.
And also, I mean  with badminton you have to be
Mm.
committed to that, you've gotta be committed because otherwise you're letting other people down.
People down.
Yes, yes.
Oh yes.
Yes.
You said.
That's right.
Yeah.
I mean, I said no I've got enough without, without being 
 
Vice Chairman.
I don't mind ha as much 
 
as I can, when I can, but I don't want to have to be there  all the time, every time there's a committee meeting there
Mm.
every time there's, you 
Mm.
know, there's that, gotta go here and get things.
Mm.
Don't want that.
I don't mind being told what to do 
Mm.
Yes.
Mm.
and doing it.
I mean, I was there  er, I left yesterday afternoon, I mean, I had to go in early and we had erm  an auction  and I helped do that.
So, I don't mind doing that, I don't mind helping  but I don't want to be
You want  
involved in any more 
No.
business.
No.
Because otherwise yo you miss out on something else
Yeah.
cos you get fed up of them in the end
Yeah.
anyway, don't you?
Yeah.
Anyway, is this committee coming to order?
Yes.
Yes.
Or is it turning into rabble!
Right.
Is there anything left   
Yeah well  there is about seventeen pounds in change in there but we still have to get the Christmas puddings cos we haven't seen any yet.
I've got the  was there something?
I haven't been up to buy meat  
Well I didn't go 
No.
er er
because  er we had a rather an in-depth session at the football on the telly on Monday night.
 
and there were, I'd got a, a room full of young boys wanting to watch Crewe  play Liverpool.
And er  I don't think I was particularly keen of having a house full and I thought 
Mm.
while th going out leaving them
Yeah.
I fell asleep.
Oh.
Er, and  I'd forgotten to take the money up before  Christmas  so it was still here yesterday.
Well, I wasn't there .
And, I was expecting you and I took a  a bag full of clothes  just to try 
Well I told you not to go in  
on Monday night.
Yes I 
Did you?
was just after those things.
How they, how they know .
Anyway, what I'd got was a bag of clothes for Caroline to try
Oh!
Super!
she might have to 
Yeah.
cos some of them are trousers but they're really 
Yeah.
nice and really warm and there's a sweater dress and a jumper and 
Ooh!
Ooh!
these things.
Yes.
Yes.
And I brought them up on Monday night
Yeah.
in case you and Sandra came.
Well she'll be there this Monday.
Yes.
Have you, you got er, have you, well you've got transport
Yeah.
for her?
Aha.
I shall be there this Monday.
This is what we want  some little of the  like them crafts made.
I got it on one of their dos Sunday morning from June's.
What is it?
Just some  
Oh!
Yes of course.
I thought, well that's a nice little thing.
Yes.
Innit?
Yes.
Yes.
That's a cherry drawer that is.
Yes, I got one of them when I got 
Yeah.
And for no more money.
Are mine smaller than that?
Yeah.
Only that bit.
Mm.
But, they're from erm  Kwik Save and they're no dearer in this nice little jars than they are in the plastic tubs with the same cherries 
Yeah.
on.
Oh.
Mm.
I thought, oh if we could hold of some of them what we could do with them.
Yeah, yes,bu yes.
Er, I've loads.
You know, in fact, they're bigger than that, but the big jar's like a chocolate tin with the red lids on  whether you could fill them with bath crystals and some things like that.
And people are more into foam baths and that sort of thing
Yeah.
nowadays aren't they?
Yeah.
Unless you were to put, like to fill, to fill it with a cheap flannel and a bar of soap  and a sponge.
Yeah.
Well we'll have to think of summat.
Mm.
Ooh!
If we're er  having the centre
Yeah.
Yeah.
for the  are we that far or shall we offer them 
Well 
a lift?
I er, I was just going to bring them up with erm  you know about the cheque, cos you got 
Yeah.
did you know about the cheque?
We got a donation given to us.
From your dad?
No.
No.
That never came, that never came to fruition.
Didn't it?
Oh.
In so much that, they were dithering over other things that we think 
There's another cup of tea in, er, Margaret if you want a cup.
er, they were meeting  and the lad who was supposed to be at the meeting didn't know what they'd come to decide on.
We'd got to go and pay a bill 
That's right.
Yeah.
Oh.
and they needed to know what to pay.
Yeah.
So in the end I had to say I haven't got any more time to chase up after him, but I could always probably come back again later on in the year.
It would have meant 
Yeah.
I would have to pay for it and try him again.
I think Christmas beca cos  there was that  er   you see, they were sorting out
Yeah.
and I was blue with that with them on one and at this on the other 
Yeah.
and the lad who was dealing with it all, we had some hassle from another quoter.
And then he said, they haven't had their meeting.
Mm mm.
He said, how do they what they've said, but they haven't had it?
No, we had a cheque which we presumed had come from  Social Services
Yeah.
and when it arrived it turned out to be a donation from the Lord Mayor's charity.
It had 
Oh!
been applied for on our behalf  so it wasn't in fact from Social Services.
Mm mm.
And it  had been made out to
The church.
the church.
Mhm.
So, in the end  rather than send it back and ask for 
Mm.
it to be rewritten  we usually have one event after Christmas that pays for the extra gas and heating that we use.
Yes.
Er, I know it's twice what we normally pay, cos it was a hundred pound.
Yeah.
But on reflection, a quick little sub-committee meeting at the end of Christmas Day he said well  we've paid it now, but we are in fact, in hand
Yes.
Yeah.
Mm.
for the next twelve months 
Yes.
that we use the hall.
Yes.
Right.
Yeah.
Even though we never asked, I think we still have to make 
Yeah.
sure
Sure, yeah.
that we're not  costing anything.
Cos that very nice I think.
That's all, yeah.
Yeah.
And I  
So, I mean, if anybody 
wear and tear 
Yes.
then
I mean, if anybody asks you to see if it's gone through our books it hasn't, but
Mm.
having said that  it's in lieu of the debt that we would have paid.
Yeah.
But, I then, subsequently met  the chappie in charge of Social Services outside the school!
Who said, how did it go?
Blah, blah!
Very nice.
He said there might be some more money coming.
From them this 
Yeah.
time.
But he 
Oh oh!
he said this last year
Yeah.
and it never came.
And the year before!
So  I mean, I will continue to harass him through the twelve months if possible, because I think
Well when you think how many people we have to  
Yes, they 
I know!
yeah.
Yeah!
And they
Of course!
for those who are housebound 
But I mean 
and incapable of driving 
They only have to think about 
they have to provide it 
 
for them, you see.
So we take 
Yeah!
it off them.
We take it off 
Yeah.
and they should 
Yeah.
come round.
We're not doing it to compensate Social Services
Yeah!
we're doing it 
No!
to provide a day for the people who 
Yeah.
come.
Yeah.
But, at the same time it does take the burden off them.
Yes it does!
Yeah!
Of course!
I mean, they 
Yes!
should have to find somebody to go wouldn't they?
Yes!
They would.
Course they would!
Yeah.
Yes!
So, I will carry on.
But, at the moment, there's enough in there to pay off what debt we've got left.
For the puddings in there?
For the puddings.
And there's a few coppers left over.
Well I've got mine then, that woman give me.
Yeah.
Well, in the bank's four hundred and forty seven.
So, we are well in hand.
Mm!
Erm  we went up as high as er  eight hundred forty one  erm 
What do you reckon it'll cost this year then, er last year then Sandra?
About  er  I keep saying we need somebody to keep account book.
About 
Mm.
six hundred pound.
 
About five to six hundred 
Yeah.
pounds  
I, I thought about six hundred.
Bearing in mind that this year we got a lot more, I mean, we  we got all those crackers and blowers from  the hotel.
Er, I haven't sent him a letter back yet cos I thought, wondered whether anybody'd like to volunteer to write, I sent a card last year.
What's this?
Er what is it for?
The  Borough.
They sent
Did they?
one hundred and fifty crackers and a tub of at least a hundred blowers!
Ooh!
Well how do they get it bearing in mind the other 
No, the co the cost of that alone
Yeah.
those boxes of crackers are about  I think they're about fifteen pound a box and the three 
Mm.
boxes
Mm.
Mm.
Fifteen 
But 
pounds a box!
Well there's fifty in each one.
Oh!
Yes.
Yeah!
I think there are  ah, no!
No!
No!
I was gonna say!
No, they're nine pound.
Cos I know when I went to the warehouse
Oh that
Yeah.
erm  when I went the first year I looked at them.
Do you remember when I bought the wrapping paper
Yeah.
Yeah.
and they were up there then.
And I looked at them and I thought well it's a lot of money to pay out, we'll see what comes in.
Erm  and on, on reflection
I er  I didn't buy them and he sent us three boxes and they came from the same warehouse.
Oh good!
Yeah.
Course they cost a lot 
I think a letter would , I think a letter would be very nice.
The manager of the hotel?
Don't ask me his name because it's Italian!
No, just to the manager, Borough Hotel, what's the, what's the ?
The Villa Arms 
The Villa Arms.
Hotel.
I hope he hasn't got his tea towel with him!
Villa Arms hotel?
Yes.
Yeah.
Right.
And he sent  three boxes of crackers.
Yeah.
A hundred and fifty crackers
Er
and a box of blowers.
a hundred and fifty crackers  just a letter addressed 
Yeah.
and a box of blowers.
Just to say thank you very much, they were very much appreciated.
Well they were, because 
Oh!
Very good!
things like that, and we also, I think this year we ought to send Sid one  because he came up with  ten litres of  five each of them boxes  so came up with ten litres of wine.
Well I thanked him twice.
I know.
But
Nice really to write a letter.
I think, I think to have made 
 
effort, that's to the
It's his wife who normally does things.
Well, it might put the cat among the pigeons June, but then so what!
 
It needs revitalizing !
Well I thought I would  
As half of them would
they all made funny 
Oh!
pictures on the 
Oh yes.
wall.
Oh that's my er  lads up in from the .
I've seen them there.
Oh!
Cos when the
On behalf of the war times  
That's the last one there.
committee?
Yeah.
They 
Yeah.
show .
Oh.
And they never lose them then.
Bit difficult.
Yes.
Yeah.
They said at the Cricketers this year.
It's at the Crick 
Cricketer's Arms.
Er, well, was it Mr  this time?
Er  er  ?
Yeah.
Shouldn't you put Mrs and Mr cos they are man and wife.
Well that's, oh yes alright.
No.
 
S A,?
Yeah.
Yes.
Cricketer's Arms.
Just do a duplicate copy of the letter.
And also, I think, to add .
Ooh yes!
They should have one.
And, the manager of ?
No, Arthur 
No.
.
Arthur
Is he the manager there?
No he was the one that  
He's the commissions manager.
Arthur
.
Well I think if you were to send it to 
 
the manager, care of, Mr Arthur .
Mr Arthur .
If we send it to the manager, care of  Mr Arthur .
Right.
Yeah.
Care of, Arthur .
How do you spell Arthur ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would just .
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I, I tell you something else and all  on Saturday  it's erm  Margaret
.
's birthday.
Oh is it?
Yeah.
So I think er
A card.
if we all sign on a card.
I've got one.
Have you got one?
Right.
And er, I'll put it through.
Right.
Fine.
Because by God she's a great'un int she?
How did she go on 
I know.
at  does anybody know how she went on at her dance  New Year's Eve?
Well I was there.
No, there was nobody there.
Did she go?
Yeah.
Who?
Margaret?
Yeah.
Cos she, I heard her voice 
A New Year's resolution.
Oh!
That
Well, why I'm asking
Yes.
I saw her on the way to the doctors and she'd thought she'd got chicken pox.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
No, she's had .
I said, I bet you're allergic to something.
Oh nothing 
Yeah.
Sandra, I've been with somebody with chicken pox 
Yeah.
Mm.
cos she said if I can't go do you want two tickets?
I said, well I'll find somebody but I hope you haven't got chicken pox.
Oh no, she went.
Er er urgh!
The music was terrible!
Mm.
We left here at half past eight  and we didn't get on the dance floor till twenty to ten  cos there was three 
Oh.
girls hip-hippy shaking.
Oh!
That was the music.
Oh!
And when he played a square tango  it was just like er  .
You know, I mean tramping.
Ah!
Dear.
It were true.
 
It was full eight.
Oh!
Then he played summat else.
Well we ha went round wo we had to come off the bloody dance floor !
 
Yes I said, no, I said next year  we'll have tickets but if it's the same whatsit we don't want him.
Well we pay all that money for the disco thing.
Yeah.
You don't have much to eat either do you?
Oh yes!
It's quite 
Well yeah.
good, yeah.
There was two salmon sandwiches, two cheese 
Oh yes.
I was talking about another dance where you've had your bit 
There's only bit I've .
Oh!
It's only a jacket potato missing.
Oh!
And all the er  rice and  oh there was salad on the table.
Oh was there?
Quite enough.
Oh!
Yeah.
But erm  the music, oh dear!
What er, Margaret are you talking about ?
 
Got blonde hair.
She came up Chris Christmas day in the home.
Up there in the home.
.
It's, I think, it's in the book.
Oh really?
Oh why 
Well 
should we  then?
No.
No.
She has.
Not for most.
She had, and  
I think I know the bar lady.
Oh yeah.
It was lovely!
But even they couldn't dance to the music.
Couldn't they?
No.
No.
And er, there was another  table  there was eight or ten on that one.
Erm  the little one Marg.
I dunno, she always call him Aden.
We've got nicknames for them you see 
Mhm.
and I'd had a  and er they, I never saw them on the floor.
Oh.
And they do all the sequence dances.
I know that, they love dancing.
A do we know how erm Mavis is?
No.
Well getting a better, a little bit better each day.
Was she badly hurt?
Never felt better.
That was a shame Margaret .
She didn't have any broken bones.
Oh and  I mean th there was some little Christmas tree, gingerbread  al 
Yeah.
almonds on.
And they had little pink icing of a star on the top  and we must have had six dozen.
Oh that's nice.
And they, a lot of them got
Is this when they rang up and said they'd got cakes left?
Yes, yeah, and Julie went down 
Yeah I had them.
and saw 
and 
them.
we did, some had gone out on the plates and then I had three boxes left and I was going round giving them out.
I got rid of them all cos they're all taking them home.
Yeah.
And, there was some on a plate and my sister's little lad went up and went to take one off this plate and then Valerie tu turned round, she said er, you can't have one of them, them are for the old folks.
 
Ah ah!
No!
And he was , cos it, I really want a Christmas tree  
Yes.
only it was just what 
Mm mm.
he wanted.
Yes.
Oh!
She wouldn't let him have it.
Tt!
Oh!
Well , and God's honest truth I never saw them.
Cos they went out and they were playing 
That's it.
and that's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos, I suppose it was cos we were all so 
Mind you,a 
er 
you do find don't you?
But I
I mean I don't know  cos I'm not, I think when they give something away for nothing  it's almost worse than when they're paying.
And when 
Well 
they're paying they don't want to 
unfortunately  
I, I mean there were two plates 
Oh yes.
of salmon sandwiches
Yeah.
and we've, I mean we've said this on reflection afterwards, as much as we don't like cutting up plates of sandwiches  there must have been some that took home half a dozen
Yeah.
salmon, and there were some 
Yeah.
that never saw a salmon.
No.
We didn't get, we'd 
I 
loads over cos .
No.
My father never saw a  
I said I bet, when I saw this June .
I said that  I couple of the 
No.
sandwiches, there's a cup of tea I said and they'll never know.
No.
I never 
Well you know what?
the only thing I got was of Stella 
 
cutting that cake all the time.
Cos she'd burn more.
Old fashioned trifle 
Oh don't make me Pat !
Yeah.
She had a cake.
She had a cake.
They always say the thought might be worse and to, we know it costs about, it costs about ten pound to buy  well, I think at the end of the day worth it, is to put them out on a paper plate.
Yeah.
Simply
Yeah.
not to save the washing up but to stop the arguments
Yeah!
that came!
Yeah.
As to who'd got what.
 
And if they didn't want it then, they had a plastic bag they 
Yeah.
could have just put their plates in and taken 
Yes.
it home.
As it was, I mean I found another chocolate gateau under those Christmas tree cakes.
And somebody said, we haven't had any cake!
And I went, I know everybody had a piece of this chocolate on their plates, but there was nothing else I could do, once they saw it that was it.
Yeah.
I never got to the end of the table.
Yeah.
Mm.
And there are 
I know.
there were sixteen  portions 
Yeah.
and they sell at fifty four pence
Yeah.
a slice.
I never saw that those, under that ga table.
No I didn't.
 
I was left with the 
You know 
trifle left, and by the time the trifle was there but there was no sandwiches or .
Do you know what it reminds me of.
I, I will, I always 
Oh .
used to give our kids  birthday parties, always  and when Paul had a, I don't know if you knew Jason 
Yeah.
erm last year?
A little 
No.
boy named Jason  tha he's a young man now but when  and we used to have the sandwiches on the table and Jason always used to sort of take umpteen and po pile them up on his plate and 
Yeah.
and I used to say, just take, there was loads
Mm.
just take one at a time.
But no.
Yeah.
He had to have  five or four 
Some are like that.
Well I 
Well I think those old people are 
Yeah.
like that.
She's like that even now at thirteen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If he hasn't got three times more than anybody else he'll scre 
Yeah.
you know, he'd have nothing.
But I mean old people
Yeah.
They're the sa the same  
yo you know they're  are like children aren't they?
 
They want everything
Yeah.
just going for them.
Mind you
Yeah.
it's better than throwing a lot of stuff away.
Oh yes 
Yeah.
but
They can eat it at home when
You can say if 
That's right.
if, if, if it had been proportioned 
  
out  that, they had one salmon, one cheese, one ham 
Yes.
with a couple of cakes  and one of these 
Yeah.
Christmas tree, a bit of  
Yeah.
Yeah.
and given them a dish of trifle I think a lot would have just eaten the trifle, had a cup of tea and taken the rest home.
The rest home.
Oh yeah!
As it was
Yes
they were seeing how much more they could eat and take home.
Yeah.
And if they knew it had all been 
Yes.
divided and gone out there wouldn't have been a 
Yeah.
problem.
Mm.
Yeah.
D'ya think it might be worth writing to some of the  and asking them  to donate any paper plates?
We, we actually wrote to the manufacturers of paper plates 
Yes, that's right.
the first year and the most you get out of them is they don't even bother to come and see you in the corridor do, who went down?
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I know.
Somebody went there.
Was that Deeko?
Yes.
Stood outside and  I'd been rung up 
That's shocking!
rung up and th 
Yes.
many times, not only for this group but for another one.
Yeah.
And they don't even answer.
Ooh!
How awful!
And we lost our contact didn't we?
Although I, we wasn't  surprised by them 
Yeah.
suddenly erm   
Anyway, shall we start ideas, good 
Right 
ideas?
Yeah.
Well 
That we put the teas out
Yeah, the plate.
on the plate.
Yeah.
Save a lot of bother.
Mm mm.
Well it, it, it caused a lot of aggravation to some 
Yeah.
that
Didn't
particularly those in wheelchairs that couldn't fight their way to another table 
Well I said  can 
Yeah.
I get you anything?
But th none of the men had too much  it'd be the women who'd be in 
Oh yeah.
there.
Yeah.
Cos we couldn't find this  for lunch over 
Yeah.
there.
Mm mm.
The women  that erm, I must admit though that 
 
Yes.
The men's 
The er 
was just there.
the dinner organization was better cos we did manage to get seconds out to those that wanted it.
Yes.
Yeah.
And, there wasn't one complaint about the turkey.
No.
Yeah.
Not one.
One complaint about the carrots.
Carrots.
But we solved that didn't we?
Said it was lovely.
She wasn't that 
Oh well I'll get 
sure.
I said to Edie, was the dinner nice?
She says yes, but the carrots weren't done.
And she'd got two little rings of carrots left on her plate.
And so, after, bringing out a spoonful, so I went to  and er  tasted them, I said mum they were done, done to perfection.
She said well it must have been just those two little bits.
Have you got a photograph of her Pat?
Aha.
Cos we're keeping a photograph of all
She's  .
Is that it on my bag?
Yes.

Dearer.
Yes, I noticed that.
 
Well I had breast.
But, the breasts were the same price
Mm mm.

And we didn't, we, we only needed five.
We only needed five.
Bearing in mind, you only needed four though and knew they hadn't of come cos well 
Oh yeah.
having said that
Yeah.
they weren't wasted cos you went 
Did you put your hams on the dinners?
They had a slice of ham 
Oh did you?
and a slice of turkey.
Yeah.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Er erm  I think, I mean they all eat  most of them eat the ham, there were a few that sent it back  I think it was probably a bit much for them.
Yeah.
Mm
But er
Did you slice it yourself?
Yeah.
I've got 
Two 
two electric, electric 
two electric 
carvers.
I used one of them on the

You di , straight o I'll demonstrate.
Give me these here.
No!
No, you put that to, turn that to a different colour.
What you did, you went into the middle and out again.
You've got to go to the middle and straight across.
But then, if there's another one  there
Well you just came 
because your draughts are like this.
You just go and
I had a, that's a straight line because then when you get to there you put another straight line across another jump!
You've gone a straight across there.
A straight line.
What you had done
But you didn't let me go like that!
You did!
You did that all the way down that line when you started didn't you?
So why didn't you let me have that one then?
Because what you did, you went  over to the top of it  in a sense, and then  straight at  an angle to it.
You've to go straight across.
When you did it this way you go straight across, straight across,strai , but yo your second jumps you were doing you were going there  like that  instead of going straight across.
Do , show me what you've just done.
I went across yours like that.
So I can jump over mine too.
Yes!
But yo , not the way you did it over here.
So why didn't you let me go
No because you di , you made two, you made two mi , what you did on this one over here you moved into a space first  and then jumped.
That was your move.
Yeah, he did do this.
He went 
You did 
like that.
that, and then jumped.
Well that was your move into the space.
There's yours.
Excuse me!
That was there.

Ian's not far enough across the board to do anything to me.
What you doing?
Mm?

And then you'll have to go round.
Oh yes!
I know what you mean now.
Are you playing at er, a cheating game you two?
 
 
Mm?
And he goes backwards?
Yeah?
Ooh!
My go, right.

Yeah!
That'll do 
He

That's right.
Tarrah!
I don't think fifty pound  will cover it do you?
Well how many, how much is wrong?
I don't know.
Where would you go?
I think  we could do with doing like we said and asking St. Edwards if they've any.
Did we think we about the old staff did you say?
Erm on there but it's 
Yeah, it is, it isn't closing.
Oh isn't it?
No, well not yet, they're hoping for a takeover bid.
Oh!
Machine.
I don't reckon everybody's gone home   
Well when I say , they're certain, a big  one.
Like one of those great big ones 
 
that you use in the school.
Yeah, there is a  to do anything.
Oh!
Well se , she's now, she's given up, they've got a paper shop at   Blaby I think.
Mm.
I dunno whether she does it.
They want to try and get her home instead of going in a school.
I mean what 
Oh yeah.
we've said it, if we can accumulate our own pots and pans, we'll be like before they're there for everybody up here to use.
Well exactly , yeah.
Because everybody is beginning to meet
Yeah.
Well Maureen's doing a bit of catering now 
Yes.
as well.
And, it's  we like 
Yeah.
we said  it's easier for us  than to keep borrowing Eileen's every year 
Yeah.
True.
Because, if we start building up.
We're building up the crockery.
Yeah.
We could do with building up the .
Because we , even if we ever came to a final close if 
Yeah.
we ever had to 
Well how much are a big pan?
How much are they?
Well we don't know, but I've tried the education authority, they haven't got any in stores at the moment.
Where would we go for it  
And I wondered about  Chedderton 
Er, that, no th that  
St. Andrews.
Is it in that little square ?
St. Andrew's Place.
I bet it was shut.
Well I'll start at Old Street.
Yeah,th 
The County Caterers 
Yeah.
I think it is.
I've er, oh I've been there.
I've to get Friday off.
They're very expensive though!
Because I've been to catering things  
I was , you see, when the   Head was closing.
Yeah!
 Teddleton whether they would have any.
But I 
Oh yeah!
I tried ringing them and I didn't get any answer on the phone 
Oh!
you see, so I didn't try again, but  maybe tomorrow if I think about it 
Yeah.
in the morning I'll try it again.
Well is this the  place at ?
It's not, it's St. Andrews
Is it?
Place.
Why is that 
It's erm 
one ?
down George Street.
It's just a shop right at George Street.
Coming up from the baths.
Go past
And there's a, like a little square, a little set back of shops.
And it's set back like that on the crossroads.
Oh!
Yeah!
By 
It's near the castle?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have to go in and have a 
 
look  at what they've got.
Yeah.
You know.
Well I was thinking that fifty pounds off the gas board.
No.
But we haven't actually had a set amou , although they said that there would be money coming
Mm.
nothing came out of the last committee meeting to a definite, this is definite this.
Well I mean er we could always have raffles ourselves anyway!
I mean, you could, you know what I mean, used to have a little raffle every week.
In fact, we've had  
See we bro , we bought , we bought six turkey tins
Yeah.
rather than keep using the big tins for the school.
Yeah, the school.
I mean, they're ninety nine pence a tin and turkey tins stowed for years so I don't think these are gonna come to any harm over 
No!
the next five or ten 
No.
years.
They'll have paid for themselves.
Yeah.
What did you think of then?
Er,we well I thought
And wo we these warehouses Maureen has a ticket ou , have you a ticket  
I've got one.
Do they sell them there?
Not large catering ones, I haven't
Oh!
.
So the  we want somebody in th , do we know anybody who, in a hotel who would get some like er 
Well  we do have a contact at a hotel.
I thought you might have Sandra 
Oh I know!
I mean, let's 
Who?
face it, there's not many.
Oh!
.
Who?
We have a contact in a large hotel in the town
Well this is what I thought.
It might be worth asking mightn't it?
Fabulous!
Yeah!
If they could order you some and then, you know
And like in a very  
Have you any money in the house?
Yes.
Yes!
All of five pounds 
No we haven't it's 
have we!
No.
No.
No.
Well I mean, if you bought them and then you're building up during the year, but you know, we can always have them for 
See apparently education now, we're on a such a cut back that they've 
Yeah.
recycled them so much by the time we get back to school  they've had it!
Well, I'm afraid, I look at it, like, that if you've run out of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the time isn't it?
And then if you started off in here  
But bearing in mind  we use  four  of the big ones
Yeah.
right, so  for starters, one isn't any good.
No.
Yeah but 
Wo , I mean one is a start but  erm, in that I may as well still got a half a dozen off the school.
How much is she paying for school?
Yeah.
How much do you think
They're bound to be at least sixty, to eighty pounds a pan I would think, if not 
A pan?
Never!
Oh you, well they
I bet you you're not going to be far short of at least that much per pan.
I mean an ordinary 
What type can you get?
strong saucepan
Yeah.
ordinary household now, you're looking at thirty pound!
Or depending, yeah 
, now I mean it, I mean 
Mind you , you don't have to do, with it being gas , you don't have to have a solid thing 
No.
thing do you?
The aluminium 
No.
ones are alright aren't they?
Er, providing 
That's what I want.
but you see being catering, they come heavier and thicker 
Yeah.
anyway because of 
Yeah.
the amount of time that they're the stove.
Yeah.
That's true.
Mm.
Anyway,
I might 
you'd have to ask wouldn't you?
Yeah.
And I mean, it's great!
I mean, er the thing is if you've got a name and you want to  that's the time to work for it in that little 
Mm.
thing  
Will we have individual pies?
Yeah.
And I suppose, instead of doing pie and peas
Yeah.
we'd do stew 
Do a lot of
.
I see!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Oh!
Makes a change.
That's a good idea!
Yeah.
Except 
I see!
with the crusty tart.
Oh.
And the raffle.
The thing is now, when will you be ?
Er
Perhaps a tenner.
They're not prepared to settle for sarnies and a cake on the side.
Well that's 
You see 
so popular you see Sandra
And unfortunately 
 
we have one 
Yo , you know when the

They're in a hall playing badminton or something so too far away and a lot of shouting and laughing all at once.
Impossible!

Or is that the lady with 
Oh!

The one .
Mm.
Must have come from Keele  doesn't she?
Oh yes!
Henry .
Oh!
Oh yeah.
Mm.
.
Right.
When's he placing the order?
He's not late at the moment, so  What?
Who's he placing the order with?
Erm  well  all the groups are going to have  be  changed around, er, from February  erm  I don't exactly know yet
Mm.
at the moment who, who, who you'll be  er, taught by, because it really depends on er  how the timetable works out.
I think it'll be  different groups.
Probably, er I don't know even, you know,th the groups may not rema , remain the same.
It depends on how your timetables work out and er, how the  available tutors' timetables work out.
Right.
So it maybe a bit different.
Erm 
Will it still be this room or  will 
Erm 
it be a different room?
no , it won't be this 
Oh!
room.
No.
I was going to say that, definitely because 
Yeah.
because it's a  room  and I won't be  involved 
Oh right.
from er  the point of view 
Thank you.
 
of that.
Mm.
Erm  well it'll be useful I think for you, I me , assuming that peoples' timetables may well have changed a bit since er, the beginning of last term  it'll be useful  if you
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
it'll be useful if you would  fill one of these in
Mine hasn't.
for us again please.
Oh!
Have you got mi , do you want me to do it again anyway?
Er 
Cos mine isn't altered.
Isn't it?
Erm
It'll  yours won't.
I know, well mine 
Well you might as well do it as 
Do it again?
if all the others are doing it.
I think I've probably still got yours but 
As for what subject, I'm not sure what it's gonna be cos I've gotta pass  in the
Yo no , you're not sure yet?
I don't know.
Oh!
But I can put in  
But I think, aren't they always , their timetables are at the same time aren't they, the topics?
Well yes, we have everything at .
Oh I see!
Oh yeah, well  you've obviously passed if they .
That's right.
Yeah.
Erm, I was just saying this before you came in Hannah that er  er  they'll  probably be quite different groups from the beginning of February and certainly will be  er  a change of tutor as far as you're concerned cos I won't be involved in the .
And I can't  er, so you'll, you know  you will be this, for this  three, for three weeks in erm  in er  January.
Yes.
So is the erm, tutorials likely to change?
 
Well we haven't had  
Oh of course, yes!
all of a sudden it will change.
Yeah.
They'll be a different tutor and a, a different room obviously we
Mm.
whichever tutor'll be with you and
Tutor.
tutor will probably
Especially when we've been going well.
That's a shame!
Yeah, last year we got so much equipment ah the  that's just a  there, but
Mm mm.
you know
Ah!
That's 
Oh that's a quarter  
Oh!
Ju , is anyone likely, oh thanks very much.
I haven't bothered to put myself down for tutorial or shall 
No don't 
do it?
don't bother because actually 
And the , the core topic at the bottom is only two weeks so
This one here, you want?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The education for the afternoons  starts  in
Is that  two weeks  from January?
Yeah, it's a  Friday, and then another Friday but just the other ones 
And that's our core is it?
that's it, yeah.
Ah!
Well  you can cross that out ta actually because it's really  er, only from the beginning of February is it?
Or well you se 
No, well that 
you see anything 
Yeah.
that happens before the beginning of February  you can leave out.
I think it's .
I think, I I'm positive it finishes by the end of term.
What that one?
Yeah.
This is your one is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's going to on to February is it 
Eh?
this topic  you've got?
Er
Yes.
I can't re , I  I can't remember when we exactly started, I've got quite a lot this term.
Yeah.
I see.
Right.
Oh right.
Oh well.
Is anyone likely to see Fran ?
Tomorrow  probably.
In a class do you mean, or 
Mm.
oh well, she probably be there cos she's, she's got flu.
Oh!
Erm  other than er does anyone, is she friend of anyone in this group?
Is anyone likely to see her  other than in classes?
No?
Erm  cos I want to have her try and go with er  
Shall I hold onto it and try and find out?
Try and sort her thing out.
Yeah but what ha , any idea when you might be able to find out?
Yeah, I'm gonna try and get into .
Ah!
I see.
That's probably when it will be.
But it will be  er, er this week ?
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Yeah, well, as soon as you can  er, let me know that.
Shall I borrow it?
?
Do you mind if I borrow them?
No, it don't matter, no.
But don't forget to let me have it will you?
Yeah , okay.
Put it in your book or your folder there .
Oh I .
Having got  
You have put your names on have you?
What's it meant to be?
Erm  a little 
Pardon?
hardback one but I don't know if it's right one.
I thought .
Is it?
Which 
Oh yes!
Just put it in there.
Oh yeah.
Oh actually, hang on!
It's one of these .
Must be your day isn't it ?
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't think I've got that one.
This is erm  er th er th , from, from February onwards, up to the end of the May, in fact  anything that's likely 
Yeah.
Mm.
to affect your, you know, it's a big extra demand on your time  over that period, first of February to end of May.
Cos that's, that's the er 
I've put it , oh I've put it 
 
that goes to the summer doesn't it?
Cos the education will then come on to Thursday, Friday isn't it?
After Easter.
No, it's not, they've changed it around a bit.
No.
No.
But it comes 
So that 
onto Thursday and Fridays.
Does it?
Yeah.
But don't know 
So does it affect your 
Yeah!
You don't know yet.
If if it's go , well yo , we don't know because they don't, they haven't put out exactly when it is, whether it
No, second years.
Oh!
I didn't know either.
Yeah.
Well is it erm 
isn't it?
is it a kind of first come, first served sort of 
No.
Won't be, it expands 
Will you able to pick 
in the summer  and they take over two more
Must be the heat that  does it !
It must be the heat that does it!
Yeah.
And we only know that if it goes on for Monday afternoons for an hour, instead of 
Yeah.
being an hour it's going onto two  hours
Mm.
and it's going to be afternoons.
So when it
But apparently it will go on into the  being Fridays, but
Oh I see!
Oh well you may find you might have to renegotiate something  in the summer term then I suppose, but you'll just have to see it how it works out.
Mm.
I suppose we could always, you could always swap with somebody in groups couldn't we?
Yes.
There's likely to be four groups meeting
Right.
at times, so erm  there's likely to be one group that is late
Yeah.
and er  erm  ah yes!
Oh my gosh!
Mm?
So does everyone know what er  
 
Bless you!
Your pushing your luck now dear aren't you?
 
,you what I meant .
 
All very complicated, yeah.
I think there's a ri 
Oh yeah.
There.
some notes here that have been here all, all the vacation, I think they're yours aren't they?
Oh!
They are, yeah.
 
They've been next to my telephone for four weeks.
Right  well there's  not much space left is there !
 
Convenient!
Does anyone know  what subjects Francine is doing?
Don't know.
No.
Do , would she start the day off  as it's a, a long 
Yes.
day  
Yes.
Oh right.
Erm  does anyone know if she's 
Would she go to criminol , does she do criminology?
I don't know.
I don't think that she does.
Er, do do do you know if she's likely to ha to have any timetable changes this term, do you know?
I have no idea.
Oh no I think she's on
 
she's still in F Y isn't she?
Oh yes 
Yeah.
so she'll 
Is she?
be on our course, it won't change 
It'll be the same?
much.
Mm.
So we, I can use the time table she 
Yeah.
gave me last term then?
Right.
Okay.
Tt!
Erm  sorry about this, but er  it's a sort of a  chore we have to  do at this stage.
Erm  now is there anything else I need to  tell you?
Erm  you'll be getting a new set of  essay  titles  soon, that is for  the second semester from February to erm  the end of  .
Erm, and the deadline for those would be   in the summer term.
But erm  I'm compiling a list at the moment on  tutors and er  I'll be able to  let you know the  probably next week I should think.
Mm.
Erm  but in the meantime  those are the first essays I can er  erm  are you erm, working on that or thinking about that?
Mhm
Mm.
Mm.
But
Mhm.
Right , okay, thinking is the first step in the way that  you know.
Okay.
What else is there?
The the  exam, for part of your assessment will be in much the same form  it'll be in two parts  er  recreating to  the two parts of the course  and,yo , you'll get roughly the same number of questions as the  than the essay questions that you have with each  each semester.
And they'll cover roughly the same topic areas.
It obviously won't be the same questions but the  same sort of areas will be covered on it.
Any, any questions about that?
Do you have a choice on that or is it compulsory all questions?
Is it what?
Is it a compulsory set of questions  on  or do we have a choice?
Well you have a 
You just said 
choice  so that 
Yeah but 
you 
How many questions do you have to answer?
you , I think it's er, the case that you have write four  four answers  four  you know, do do four questions, so you do 
Two from each?
 
two from each.
Oh!
That's it.
Right.
And erm
In three hours is it?
Three hours, yes that's 
Oh good!
right.
That's some doing !
How many words do you expect?
Well , the usual.
Well do  you're not bothered about the amount, are you more concerned with the quality?
Oh well  er, quality is more important than quantity, but obviously if the quantity is very tiny,i it is  there's not much room for quality.
Mm.
Gordon Bennett!
 
I mean a co a couple of pages of good quality stuff would be fine, in the time, you know, if people  sometimes people write half a book in that time but  er
Trouble is, how legible 
it's not always 
do you want it !
Oh it's got to be reasonably legible.
 
I mean, we do make all sorts of allowances  with exams  you know, people repeat words and th and they can leave words out and  they can't think of a  eloquent way of expressing that  something at the spur of the moment so it's  
Can you keep a dictionary?
a as long  well I don't think so.
I,yo yo , you spend too much, you waste too much time.
But erm  what we're looking for is  th , what you've learnt and er, the ability to think for yourself  and erm  all sorts of scrappiness and inaccuracies and  you know, all that, we've we make allowances for, because that happens under the pressure of time  and erm nerves.
And erm 
The  what about plans into consideration as well?
Erm 
Erm  it's a very, it's always a good idea to do a plan, cos yeah, spend  five minutes or so planning and  jot down  a rough plan  and  it might  be that we would, we wo , we would normally ignore, ignore the plan when marking  but if, you haven't finished a question and er, it's a bit thin we might look at your plan to get some idea of what you would actually written 
Yeah.
and you might get one or two marks from that, so  you don't  it's always a good idea to  do a plan.
Is the pass mark  forty six  or fifty six?
Ah erm, I ha 
And do you have to pass those papers with twenty six  points?
It's erm  I think it's one paper isn't it?
Er, there two parts 
Over two parts, yes.
Two parts  one 
Do you have to have those  oh, so it counts as one 
Erm 
anyway.
it's all, I think it's marked overall, I mean 
Yes.
it's a  percentage 
Mm.
of the overall paper.
And  erm  I always think it's a bit funny about pass marks because I don't think  you know, this is worth fifty percent and then I think what's a, now what's the pass mer mark?
And I tend to think now, does this, is this work a pass?
And 
Mm.
they, if, I mean, if the pass mark is ninety percent and  I've already decided it's worth a pass then I give it  ninety percent you see !
Mm.
Or  you know, it's that way round, and you decide 
Mm.
whether it's
you know.
I mean  it's a bit arbitrary where you put the pass  by a mark 
Mm.
actually !
Mm, I suppose it's hard 
Er 
 
marking, yeah.
but you ju , you know, you judge how good it is
Mm.
and then you decide on the percentage in relation to how good the piece is.
Do pe people mark the papers or is it just  one?
Erm  brurgh urgh urgh!
Well, finals are always double marked, I'm not quite sure about this.
I think they are double marked, yeah.
I think so.
They should be.
But  
Well, yeah I was just, you you could see them for, just thinking that perhaps you could be slightly biased in one when 
Mm.
the other lecturer might seem to be 
Yeah.
the other way and like 
Well that's right.
giving us a more or 
Yeah, well we always 
less mark.
Well, finals are always double marked  er, because of that.
Er  yeah, but when you've got a big pile of papers your judgement gets impaired  after you've  you've er  
You've got   fed up and say  
had several hours and getting bored with the same answer over and over again!
Just as if it's  !
Yeah that's  I think you'll find that.
Yeah, so  you know, er counter-marking the normal practice.
Erm  if you get a problem  just trying to remember what  what we did last year.
I think it was  it was double marked.
Did many people fail last year?
Th the question , yes the
exam erm  exam was double marked with, the question arose as to whether the essay should be double marked, because obviously they are part of the assessment.
Mm.
And I think  er, I'm hoping,sh , not quite sure what we decided about that.
In principle they should be because they are part of  erm  your assessment.
But, I'm not sure, I'll have to  enquire about that.
Er, what was the other  somebody 
Jus 
else was saying that 
Yes, I was just saying  what was your pa , did 
Oh!
many people fail?
Can't remember, but it  no  we don't expect to fail  people.
I mean, we do look for things on the papers to try  and justify  giving people  marks, you know, we're not sort of out to fail you.
We're out to pass you really, but we we won't unless it's worth it, but erm  the emphasis is on  trying to find something there to give  a mark to   sort of thing  rather than the other way around.
Er  I can't remember wha , erm  happened last year.
Er, there may be one  there may have been one that failed, I'm not sure but  they probably did a resit and  got through in September.
Er, you don't want to evolve with that do you?
I didn't realise you could do resits actually.
Well the  the tutor .
Erm
Ooh!
You may be able to, but you might have trouble with your 
 
your grant giving authority 
Yeah.
because er  they're 
I see.
not too keen on paying  for another year.
Does that go for all  subsid if you fail your  subsid you can retake?
I think you can  take another  
Retake the exam you mean?
No, I think you usually mita , submit a  another piece of work or something like that.
Oh!?
Yeah.
Yes I'm I'm not quite sure the regulations are about  subsids We, I mean we , it's only quite recently that we have had a subsidiary, erm, last two or three years, we've, for many years we didn't have one.
So, it's not a thing I'm very familiar with.
And they always seem to changing that as well you  see !
Oh!
Er, any more, any 
 
last questions on anything you don't know?
If you want to ask 
 
I'll explain to you about the course, and the exams  the rest of it.
What sort of percentage do the erm  essays that we hand in before the exams  
I think it counts 
of the mark?
for fifty percent of the overall assessment.
Oh does it?
Right.
Yes,th the two essays
Yeah.
combined would  that's fifty percent of your overall, so the exam is the other fifty percent.
So can already  be well set, you know.
Mm mm.
If you  with good essays.
Right, well, let's get on with something.
Erm  Sharon   who you heard la last night at the  
Brilliant!
Oh!
 
She was lovely!
Really, really good!
Was it good?
Yeah.
Oh!
So 
Yeah.
it was good.
Er, she runs the whole of this course, and erm  she's been with the school for years.
Erm  this was erm  all about the gypsies wasn't it?
Mm mm.
Oh yeah.
Yes.
Ho how do you  well you really sees, seem to have been quite erm, well, was it her  approach do you think?
I think 
Well 
she's so 
Or a 
vivacious about it!
Oh!
So enthusiastic!
Enthusiastic!
Enthusiastic?
really chatty as well.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
She actually made it interesting, because I think you think, oh dear, gypsies!
But yo you couldn't help but take things in.
Mm.
And th th th the er recommended reading side I think.
That, yeah.
Yeah.
I did have  er   upon my door from the last week in last term was a  saying  er, you know this one, I don't know if you've had this?
Yeah.
Did you get this one last night or did 
Yeah.
We got it from down there.
you collect it from round here?
Part of the reading.
Mhm.
Erm
She did, by the way, give us next week's as well, so you don't have to 
Oh good!
put next week's up.
Yes I thought she probably had.
Yeah.
Mm.
Erm, the other thing is that in the  Nuffield erm  it sometimes  er  er in the, in the book  er list, and sometimes it's in the photocopy books, so you have to check both  and if it's a book that's  been  erm  not come into the library over the last fourteen months you've er, you also need to check the erm   Von Ryan catalogue.
It's all a bit complicated!
It'll be  be much more straightforward when they've got the whole thing on the computer but  at the moment it's a transitional phase.
I went er, in to check whether these were available last week, just to make sure they were available and, they we , they had been reserved last term but I went to check  and, I found so much difficulty finding my way around
that I, er, I almost concluded that they weren't there
and I couldn't get them  and in the end.
You feel sympathetic to how 
Yeah.
we've been 
 
all term!
in the end it turned up 
Because this is how we've 
Yeah.
on every subject!
It turns out in the end that, that, all the readings were in there  it's just a matter locating them!
Finding them.
Yeah!
And I was looking out through the door and  you haven't got five minutes longer.
Yeah.
Well this    reading is actually in, in the corner of the book, you know, so it's in the, the list of books.
And it's nineteen eighty three so it should be  it wouldn't on the  catalogue yet.
Er, but the next week's  reading  erm  with chapter by, er from a book by  Smith  is actually a photocopy so you'd find that in the list of photocopies.
So, I'm sorry it's so  complicated  and the final week's reading is also  a book er  erm  the actual book is  got rid of that chapter.
So er, you better, you'd better check both catalogues  erm catalogue 
 
to be sure it's there.
And if it doesn't seem to be there  ask  Phil   because, you know that   is that only by asking him that I discovered that these worked  last week.
Aha.
So  he's that  sort of sma , small bearded chap, of course.
I think quite helpful on those.
Mm.
Mm.
He'll probably sa 
What about these essays then?
ask .
Cos  he
I'm so is this 
Photostat.
That's a pho , yeah that's a photocopy
Thank you.
er  from the work so that you won't find the book in there but you'll find a photocopy of that .
But, but you've just gotta be very persistent and th there are things out now, and locate Phil  and he'll  he'll tell you what's .
I hate that one!
Do you?
Yes it's  much easier.
I mean, it's bound to get easier when it's all been fully computerised.
At the moment it's all  chaotic and things.
Excuse me.
Right, so
didn't have the requirements and 
what did you learn about gypsies 
Mm.
then?
They've got very definite ideas about their size and  outstanding 
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Er, certainly are  no gypsies here.
Yeah .
I often wonder you know, whether they don't like your money cos you'd amazed at however much wealth they possess, but if you do get inside  it's amazing the collection that they  that they  round here, they used to collect red glass, and er  Spode
Mm.
and they used to be caravan down on  Lyme by the park  and 
Mm.
standing outside 
 
it was no different than anything else, but the minute you got inside
Mm.
one vase on the ledge would be two, three thousand pounds worth of red glass!
Unbelievable!
they got a  , the
Th , that is a big family round here isn't it 
Yeah.
the  gypsies?
Mm.
That's it.
And 
There's a family at Stafford as well, they live on part of it and they actually bought a field off  I don't know if you know the bypass at Stafford, the  
Mm mm.
site?
Yes.
And there's a field there, and there's nothing, a couple of ponies in it and a caravan  and when one of those died  is it last year, or the year before there was  one of the biggest funerals ever seen!
And they came from abroad  and they had a 
Yes.
big wake round here for the
Mm.
the family.
Mm.
So erm  they're, they're a quite a distinct ethnic group aren't 
Mm.
they?
Although 
Very!
they  and er  they've been around for centuries of course but er  erm  there's all sorts of myths about them  some of which are half-truths and some which un-truths.
Er  but er  they've not been studied a great deal by  
   
er  in, in this country at any rate.
Judith Oakley is er  as you know, is the   was an anthropologist  who, who did do a study  of gypsies.
Erm, there's been one or two others, erm  a guy called Thomas  who  studied er  gypsies also, and learnt their language, languages, really  erm  a bit before Judith Oakley.
But, apart from there's not been a great deal of er  anthropological study of gypsies a as an ethnic group and  you know, studying their   and their relationship with the  the common population.
Erm  so it's  in terms of erm  er, careful  logical field work  erm  there's not a great deal of information, but there's,th , there have been early anatomical historical  er investigations and there is something   a literature  erm  dating from early in the nineteenth century which  and it shows you the bloke who  also resolves to, to, to make comparisons  with what she found.
Erm  I suppose what we    ought to  focus on, is not so much the details of  the ethnography  so  came up from the study, but erm  but some of them are almost thieves 
 
which I think    erm  Sharon was  trying to emphasize  last night.
She was looking at the  the question of self-scripture, and she has  as a  a criteria  for differentiation or some, or as you might say boundary marks, it's a question of boundaries between different groups.
Erm  quite commonly, gypsies have been defined by  geourgos, it says, by the predominant er  you know, house-growing population.
Erm  how far that actually is accurate  er, designation of them as a  a group, is, is debatable.
Certainly, they have their own quite distinct way of  other people.
Did you see that evening about the others what, the so- called Tinkers.
Those that aren't true Gypsy or Romany 
Ju just travellers.
just the, just those that tag round because they've 
Yeah.
nowhere else to live and
Well unfortunately 
they frustrate them.
according to this, these excerpts from  Judith Oakley's book, they're a bit sort of flexible in the definition of these 
 
though  depending on who they're talking to, you know.
Er, for some purposes  er  other groups are excepted as  as part of the Romany , for all the purposes they're not, but then they said, it depends  if it serves their interest to say we're the true gypsies and they're not 
Mm.
then they'll say  that !
But, if on the other hand, it serves their interest it serves their interest to see the other group as, as the  as themselves  they'll say that !
Oh right !
So, I mean  th the thing is, they are  erm  they are minority group.
Erm  in some ways they're   persecuted bu , but they tend to get pushed around from post to post.
Mm.
Erm  but there's a, quite a strong  prejudice against them  from erm  the, the  population.
Not uncalled for 
And certainly 
though in many er 
Pardon?
not uncalled for though in many respects.
No.
No, I think there's there's reasons 
Yeah.
for it.
Yeah.
Certainly reasons for it.
But, the thing is that they  their attitude towards  the dominant group  and  their behaviour towards the dominant group is going to be  erm  influenced by how perceive their  like the treatment , so they're quite prepared to change their er erm  the story they present as it was, about themselves to outsiders, depending on how  they see the outsiders erm  as likely to react towards them.
If they see, some advantage in putting something in a particular way, they'll do that.
They'll manipulate the situation.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, this is, to some extent this is  perhaps to be expected of any group which is  erm  which runs the risk of being persecuted and then, they will be 
But they probably  persecuting themselves leading the risk .
Mm.
And then they control their own power then.
Mm.
Unless they .
Yes.
 
And after,yo , you can se , there's a, there's a clash of, a clash of cultures here 
Mm.
isn't there?
And I think there's a lot of 
Cos the true gypsies , the true Romany wandering gypsies tend not to settle
Yeah.
in that sense, and 
Mm.
don't actually  make the sort of mess that, what we call gypsies, the tinkers, when they're 
Yeah, but even when they move on 
just the travellers.
even when they move on they .
But those are not, I don't think those are the true  gypsies.
Those are what we call Tinkers and the Irish call the Diddicois and  the wanderers 
Or 
those are the ones that going away  tend to leave.
Yeah.
It , it's
But I think it,th the wa , the way in which  gypsies and geourgos, to use that terminology, interpreted, er interpret the same situation but in, in quite different 
Mm.
ways.
It's quite illustra , well illustrated in this  , er this  erm extract from  Judith Oakley's book.
How do you 
Best, it's the idea of dirtiness.
Mm.
Erm  gypsies have a complete, er th th they have a very, very different view of what is dirty and what is clean  but it's a very different clean from what, er the general population.
And they regard, they regard geourgos as dirty people, just as   typically , erm  the house- growing population tends to regard them as  di dirty.
But  they've got a different perception of dirtiness 
 
which is  which involves ideas of ritual purity  and impurity.
A bit similar to some of the, the  I think in  in, in a lo , attitudes towards other .
Erm  er  but some high cast Hindus, for instance, will not eat food  which  which has had a shadow of another person 
 
cast over them.
Well gypsies  the, the gypsies 
 
they refuse to eat erm  while a, while another person's shadow has fallen on them, especially if the other person is a 
 
ritually unclean person, namely, one of us.
Erm
How did erm, Judith Oakley ?
I, I don't know.
I haven't actually read the whole book, and er  and whole of that er   and  obviously pa , this is part expla , observation
Yeah.
which 
She must have really wanted to.
And er  sa , getting an appropriate way in, to something like that is, one of the main problems of that .
Yeah.
Erm, how she did it, I'm not sure.
Mm.
Perhaps you could ask er  Sharon but  she's a .
And tha , that is invariably a problem.
If you were going to do, if you decided you wanted to do research on gypsies  and, you yourself, a lot of gypsies  er, and you decide th the best way to do it is to   which gives a kind of subjective insight to their own lifestyle and thinking.
Then, it, it's immediately a problem, how do we get in, we've got to have some kind of role which is acceptable  to the people you're studying.
Mm.
again 
 
I mean, because there's always a load of  
Well that's right.
isn't 
Yes.
there?
Yeah.
I mean 
But one thing about partic , observation is, that is involves  actually living with the people you're studying for a fair amount of time is 
Mm.
traditionally
Mm.
be developed by  people who go to study childhood societies over the other side of the world  and er  you know, you stayed there, several months or a year or two, so it's not just for a  a brief visit.
So, erm  you really live 
Who finances this sort of?
Pardon?
Who finances it?
Oh!
Well, I suppose that erm 
 
erm, organizations like the Economic and Social Research 
Mm.
Council, although, the amount of money they give for this kind of research is pretty  sparse!
Erm  but  if you don't get a grant you, you do it on the side out of, you know, in  location
Yeah.
using your own salary as it were.
But to erm  get it left in terms of reputation  royalties on your books, and things like that.
Anything that   er  legally fundable erm  will have to be done and published  , which may be that .
So what I was gonna say was, that, that partic ,partic er  participant observations typically involves actually living with the, the study for a fair amount of time, so  erm  although they might tell you a pack of lies initially  you can actually observe what they're like, what they do and see whether they fit what they've said and  as time goes on you ha hope to develop some kind of rapport with them so that they might  totally understand .
Sa so, in time you hope to get sufficiently accepted  erm  to be told the truth or in fact, a bit nearer the truth.
You can never be quite sure  actually!
But, there are ways of  checking,yo you can  you can, obviously compare  words and then perhaps you can   er invariably  time about the situations and draw your own conclusions as to whether they were telling you a lie  earlier on.
And  there's lies and lies,as well aren't there ?
Er  people make up  deliberately  to be telling you lies but they still, in some sense, trying to give you a favoured view    which is a  out and out lie.
So this is one of the regular problems you've got  and er  erm  it's not a kind of strictly scientific detective way of studying gypsies  er  but it, a bit of  which, which gets  rich material, er yo you get into the  the actual way of thinking of the people you're studying.
To a great extent rather than a  a formal interview .
So  there are problems,i it's it's quite, it's rather , there's two criteria which are obviously applied to this, as a research methods, one is validity, and one being reliability.
Validity means  you're actually getting what you think you're getting.
which  er  .
Reliability is much to, much more to do with  replicability, it's, it's another  if another researcher went in and did it the same way, would they get the same results?
Well, usually with this sort of, with the replicability, or reliability is pretty low.
But validity can be quite hard with this sort of er  because there's, there's detailed ways of  and cross checking.
Er  and erm  it's difficult for people to maintain    er not only as I say, but in their lifestyle over a particular period of time, so  you could be more likely to get at the truth  by this method, than by sending out questionnaires.
Imagine  the   er as an alternative method, you send out questionnaires to a set of gypsies
would you get any replies at all?
 
 
You'd probably  the D H S S 
You might .
then!
Well with that, immediately you're gonna be suspicious 
Yeah I know.
of, I don't know what they're called, but
Oh!
erm  er, from the, probably  that would be a non-starter as a research then wouldn't it?
But even if you went in as researcher who's going to interview them, and a, and informal way  which might be a more appropriate method, you'd still have considerable difficulty in   that there is, they'll spin you a yarn  and whatnot, you know  what they wanted you think rather than what  what they should.
But participant observation you stand the best chance really  of being able to check  the accuracy of what,th they're telling you in terms of behaviour and wha , and what people say, and what different people say in those situations over the , so  you know.
Validity is quite high .
A lot depends on the personality and style of the researcher, whether they're er  how they're planning to  how they relate to people.
So obviously  one researcher  a very different er  from what another person 
Oh!
would get doing, researching the same people.
So  er  what they get, what one person gets may well be true but it'll  won't be the whole truth.
Er, another bit of the truth might be got  by another researcher  and er  so  there will be differences in what two researchers, using the same method, would get.
So, so a low, low reliability and type of researcher.
It's qualitative rather than quantitative.
And  and it lends itself to interpretive kind of approach rather than a  politics sort of approach which  tends to be .
Er, the purpose of this sort of research is to understand  the context of meaning in people's minds wi with, in terms of they do.
Er  erm  and that is typical of anthropologists.
Erm this sort  this sor , this sort of method was pioneered by   particularly by  erm  somebody called   Malonovski Er that's er  the British Academic, but obviously Polish.
Th the research in 
round about the first world war time, he used this sort of  sort of pitching his tent up to the   and staying there and learning their language and  observing their rituals, getting to know them.
And er  prior to that, researchers had relied on   from missionaries,, administrators and  travellers and so on, which  er  mixed quality.
And  this method of actually going there  living with them, learning their language  and er so on s,really participating  er  would, finally there's a way of actually  in a sense, getting  of the people, the nearer you can, anyway, of course , it's relying on the people you stay with  that you understand that something of the world comes over onto you  so that imposing  what's essential in   and  So, here what Judith Oakley's trying to do, is trying to understand  how  gypsies, themselves, differentiate , how do they define the boundaries between themselves and others.
Erm  er  and  erm  two of the main er  things, I mean, there's, there's ob , obviously erm the  things like er  they definitely .
But, erm  in terms of more subjective er  , is er, the two, two particular  features which  are important, one is descent, how they reckon they descent.
They reckon  a true gypsy must have at least one true gypsy parent  erm  it's quite possible, er the the there's a fair amount of inter-marriage, you might be surprised  to learn !
But the gypsies and geourgos  but er a lot of gypsies have got one geourgo parent   but, they would reckon that there must be some sort of descent, er   er erm  that, where they're aware of  to qua , to  qualify as a gypsy.
So wo , one parent that must have a been gypsy or both.
Er  but, how they reckon descent is variable.
This is one of the perhaps  , it's not some kind of  calculated thing, it depends on the circumstances.
Erm  er, and I think that was brought out fairly well in the  .
Th the variability on how they reckon descent in that sort of life.
The other major  seems to be, to do with ideas about  what we would qualify , but could equally well be called ritual purity and impurity.
And er  she contrasts  what  erm  except in official reports   gypsy camp sites  er    er   sort of say they're dirty and, terribly dirty er  paint of picture of erm  people with no civilized standards or er  er, that's er, the geourgo view of it.
Erm  it, and as they sa , and as she says this tends to be er  a description of a gypsy camps campsite  which looks at the external surroundings of the caravans, but it doesn't actually look inside the caravan.
Er  if they did they'd find erm  quite  spotlessly clean interiors of the caravans  but, in an area where  there's all sorts of  that   a few yards away and  quite carelessly dumped and left around.
Er  th th the the geourgo or, you know official view is  that  they're dirty because they never   and er, they leave scrap metal around and  everything  and all kind of things.
But, from one point, from that point of view it's quite true, I mean,i i if you define dirtiness in those terms, then they're dirty.
But, er the gypsies 
 
define dirty in sort of quite different way.
They haven't got this conception of  that, that the inside and the outside of the body  and what's important is to keep the inside clean  and so, this is extended also to  the  caravans.
Mm.
Er the  er  the insides have got to be kept clean  it doesn't  about  the surroundings are dirty so  you know, it's quite okay to  you know, throw your half-eaten bread out!
So if you'd like to  if you let me .
Erm  it's it's quite an elaborate erm  set of beliefs about  the, you know 
 
the dirty.
Erm  they regard the inside of the body as, as pure and to , and and essentially to be kept clean, but the outside  is essentially unclean, say, you could have a dirty, dirty clothes but you're clean inside is the .
I wonder they view erm  ?
Oh!
So what was this play then?
Puppet show?
About  the green knight.
The green knight?
Yeah.
You know, a knight.
Was he just called the green night or did 
Yeah.
he have a name?
Just the green knight he was called, cos he was green.
Mm.
And then there was this  he sa the green knight said I  am I having some chocolate?
An an we one o , will one of the knights   chopped 
Chopped off my head.
That's the story I was thinking you were doing it today  erm  it's called the green knight, but he has a name doesn't he?
Er,
And he gives them  er, a magic
Yeah!
The three things
He gives three things that'll help him.
I tho , isn't one a magic belt or something?
Yeah a belt is what they  
I was about to say the magic belt.
Oh!
Oh I bet you timed that for tea time!
What's he done to er .
It's tea time just .
For what?
Well I'm going out later.
Oh!
Yeah!
Yes.
I'll come back tomorrow night.
Alright then.

Okay.
Hang on.
No it's not mine.
What's it for?
Going out.
Well I'm going out too.

business.
Have you?
Thanks a lot!
You always seem to want a curry.
Who's?
Dad did!
Dad did.
His dinner'll be cold.
So what happened to the green giant in the end?
Well
The green knight.
All that happens right  the  the other knight  er is    and the green knight ran off and discovered that he didn't, you know the rest.
He did initially, and I said him back.
You shouldn't!
Have they been in there?
Has it been in there with the books?
No, I didn't get that far.
It's in the other room.
No, he only got this far.
Dog shite  everywhere!
Get some, smell it!
No I don't want 
Then 
to!
I'm having my tea!
I'm not surprised because every time 
everybody won't put their foot down , the only one in this house to put their foot down, is me!
Every time 
And I'm not 
you come in,a listen!
 
It was across the  before I could shout and say come back.
No one!
It's only me!
No one!
Which way did he come in?
Back door.
It don't matter!
It does!
Cos it means I put it up there .
Well I'm sorry but 
But look!
I want to I want to  
Look!
Don't you worry about it!
.
Only cos they haven't checked round the .
Mm.
See, the last one in here you was already in.
Dog shite!
I haven't seen fucking all like that!
Cleaned up all the time.
Has he, has he walked through this carpet John?
He's walked across as far as this middle door.
Ye , I know!
You already found out?
Will I have to swear!
Why have a dog?
At least I know .
I've finished!
Beans!
Come on!
Er   I'll pick them out.
I don't  want them!
Well I'm sure he doesn't go on his own a , with shoes on like that!
Well you haven't given us our .
I don't care!
Well I don't like that.
Fuck!
You'll never get that stain up!
Of course, your dinner's going cold.
Have you been in the other room John with this?
No!
 
I don't think, I shou , I shouted here.
No!
Here, then stop.
About here?
He got up to as far as the doorway, but I don't think any further.
No he didn't.
He  then we went off playing!
Dad!
Don't!
Will you stop that!
Then all round here?
Then as far as , no 
No!
love.
Just got as far as the door.
Right.
Urgh!
Urgh!
Just from out the pond?
There's only one putting their foot down  in this house!
Don't care whether they're big or small!
Come out the way.
.Urgh!
Oh!
What a good boy!
So the, you know that thing I was showing you about,th finding them bones the other night?
Yeah.
Did I put the thing in my pocket afterward?
It doesn't matter anyhow.
And I 
Well 
was, I knew that they were 
they might be still in here.
I knew that they'd still written me a, a second letter, like asking permission to send it through the erm  what do you call it?
Er  cos I owed the .
Pardon!
Come and have your tea first Hary.
Them two are no good?
No.
They're not, so, I don't know what you've got papers with this for?
Aha.
Well Mike gives his permission so
Yeah, well I don't know, that's what I said, I don't know why you've got 
John, look!
it.
Remember that thing I told you about the bones the other night?
Yeah.
I said there were the  that county record form and this man asked me from the museum that handled it  if he could send them back to erm  to Wiltshire.
Why, was it er found ?
Oh!
Yeah.
No, it's not been found before.
So they're being sent back  and he said there was a county record found.
You shouldn't ask Jonathan.
Jonathan couldn't persuade him.
Who's that?
I want,ca , I wanna ta 
Jonathan!
take one of these?
 
At mother's, you know?
David.
Ah!
That's right.
Mum, I wanted to take one of these to school and
Aye.
I don't think 
Did you?
it's feasible cos they got
Mum!
You could have told me!
Oh !
What did you do with the dog then?
What?
Are you feeding him on ?
No.
Oh!
I bet you've studied about every pile of dog muck !
Is he back yet?
No.
Seen the headlines here?
Asda's sixty five million pound losses.
Who?
Asda.
Well a bunch of the others too were down at .
Mm?
Three hundred and fifty redundancies at head office.
Twenty million written off  for launch of the new distribution system .
Well  just goes to show you!
They're depending upon  you and me and other people aren't they?
Mm.
That's who, in fact, they're living off.
Yes?
And they get to keep putting up bloody prices like they're living on, on on people!
On the poor!
You're giving it all to their profit.
Right?
Mhm.
Mm?
Mhm.
Has to be improved, like isn't it?
I always knew that!
I could have done a little the papers let them off of the hook for years!
Mm.
Sainsburys is er  the very one that has done it for years!
And I'm sure Tescos, and  have been here the longest
Mm!
ge , and not the new firms have started that.
Seen this?
Brian  created a piece of history when he invited his former teacher  to a special church service.
V I P guest was Roman Catholic  leader Cardinal Basil Hume .
They're not on about  again.
I can't  get away from it!
No.
His name John .
Sheriff.
Oh where are they?
Staffordshire.
What's this for?
Former pupil at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire .
Yeah?
Where Cardinal Hume was his housemaster.
Yeah?
And he was appointed the county's high sheriff, he decided to invite his ex-teacher to attend the traditional church service  to mark the opening of high court session.
The service at St. Mary's
Mm.
and the tenth centre was attended by civic dignitaries .
St. Mary's?
It's the church that's in  in the middle of the shopping  you know, it's got all the grass round it.
Well tha , that's the county  chur , that's the town of the  like St. Giles is here, is the town's church  well St. Mary's is the town's,o all the se service is to do with civic dignit , dignitaries  and to mark the opening of  courts is always held at St. Mary's.
They said it's,he is the first Cardinal for hundreds of years to visit St. Mary's .
Mm!
Do want some more?
Do you want that warming up?
Ah!
It'll be alright.
Well it won't because it's gone cold!
Let me, give it two minutes in the microwave.
Co co cold!
Ah dear!
Some sauce here if you want it.
So the stores are letting off work for us then, are they?
I don't even know whether they let them off at the head office.
Oh, the head office.
No you don't!
I'll come upstairs with you .
In just one minute.
Okay.
What?
Your trousers are falling off.
He'll come back in a minute.
I'll pull them up when he comes back.
Oh!
Comet opening at Festival Park!
Mm.
Mm?
Comet are opening at Festival Park.
Mhm.
Mm?
Well!
They sure .
Well see!
I can't see them keeping two stores on.
Not in the recession.
But they're looking for more erm  sales staff!
See in here.
Full time and part time, seven days a week.
So they're gonna take you on now on the basis that you work seven days a week.
Who's that?
Comet!
Says full time and part-time seven days a week.
Sales assistant, part-time.
Part-time job that offers the flexibility you've been looking for.
Day's, evening, or weekends .
It says, or weekends, so  I wonder whether they'll stick to er  giving you the chance of not working.
That'll .
It's a job though.
Worker exploitation!
Or  they don't work Sundays they're to lose their job!
Or .
Well if they take you on on the basis that you don't have to work Sundays, they can't change the regulations when you're working.
Mm mm.
I 
But 
don't think that  
one wonders whether you're forced into signing, that if needed, you'll 
Ah!
work.
That's it!
Yeah.
They might be moving into a premises that's already er, there  now.
Mm mm.
Right?
And that's the case  they're not gonna mo , they'll take the next twelve months to put  er a free run in there for twelve months.
They make that much in twelve months!
Even if it falls down after that, they're alright.
Right?
That's what .
They've got their heads screwed on!
Did you get back that letter?
What letter?
Ye oh yeah!
Did you?
Yeah.
It's in the kitchen cupboard.
I mean, the bottom there cupboard.
It's in the kitchen cupboard.
Is it all, the whole thing is back.
She sounds as if they're back together again even.
There's a little slip at the bottom.
She Sellotaped it back on.
And erm  bottom draw of the  where?
I would have thought they'd have been in touch about extending the guarantee through you.
No lunch or nothing.
You'll wear it out!
Mm?
You will try.
What time is it now?
Four fifty.
What time ?
T T F A.
Mm?
T T F A.
Mm mm.
That was where the phone call was from.
The woman that's the secretary.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Although I  I don't exactly belong to it any more, but I said I'd go down.
Oh!
They wanted some in , well she was after information.
Mm mm!
Cos she didn't realise I'd be going down.
So you're quite sure he hasn't gone in the other rooms then?
I don't think he got that far.
I shouted i 
 
I was busy on the 
Yeah.
phone  and I undid the door
Mhm.
and I turned round and shouted.
You seen what's on tonight?
No.
Nine o'clock.
Repeated.
Powerful drama about the political turmoil in Ireland during the twenties when the British Prime Minister Lloyd George met with  Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera  leaders of Sinn Fein.
No?
No.
It's on till ten and then it's on after the news, for another hour.
It's on for two hours.
Oh!
I bought you a leaflet.
Mm.
Well that's if you're o , you're on about erm  this Father Phil, you didn't mention anything.
About what?
Just said I met him.
Yeah?
I only said hello to him.
Who else has met him?
I told you , I was  it was only the man who looks after the buildings.
He's like a  porter, caretaker.
Mhm.
He knows who's coming, who's going and  who's due to use the place.
He happened to come in  on 
Are you allowed to go in there?
Oh yeah!
Co th we go in there and sit and study because  they've got a kettle and coffee and tea, just help yourself when you cup of tea.
Take some coffee up, or tea up and leave it there and  in payment for the drinks that you've had.
And he lives there does he??
He lives somewhere up  at Keele but
Aye.
I don't know whether he lives on campus or in the village.
Yeah.
I think it's in the village.
Is he permanently attached to there?
Oh yes!
Permanent.
So he must  every morning.?
I don't think it's  every day though  actually in the chapel, I think it's down at where he lives.
Cos he'll have to say mass somewhere every day  
But I think it's where he lives.
Not, not  there is a side chapel there, the east chapel and that's the catholic chapel but it's also used by the non- catholic group.
And they have united services and then split part way through.
They have a lot of united services, and then when it comes to  communion  they segregate and then join again.
But I do know that he, where he lives, I'm sure I've seen it written that where he lives  he has  services there.
Doesn't give his address, it just gives his phone number.
Mhm.
But that's what you check.
Ah but it doesn't say there, it doesn't.
Well when it does ste , it, you can fill that in and send it to them and then they phone.
And you can sort of join in the  the church group.
And it sort of lets them know who you belong to.
That's the people who I would think more probable for those who are living  on campus.
There's the free church, Anglican  Associated Anglican .
But you will let them know that you're there like and I mean that 
No , because I have a parish of my own.
No, but it would be nice because it's an extra one on the list.
Well i 
You boost up.
You are a catholic you should be able to .
I, he he said that but I
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's no for  if you're going to be there all the time, that they know where you are and where they can contact you.
Yeah, but it's nice to boost up the list 
Well 
because they might have only a few, whereas the others have got thousands on them.
Right?
Well the 
Er 
last time I 
and Father   does he, does he know that you are a catholic?
Oh, the other chappie who was there, he knows.
Actually, he, he knows that  Paul  the bloke who looks after the place he goes to St. Andrews.
Ah!
That's the
And er
Church of England isn't it?
And he ac 
Yeah.
he actually told, said to him when he came in, he said, oh he is one of your flock!
So he came in and he  he said this is  Father  and I said, oh are you better?
Yeah.
And he looked, I said well  I knew you'd been ill.
Yeah.
And I I explained, like, I said  where I lived like, and he said ooh I stayed there convalescing at .
I said yes I know you did.
Erm  and I just said, I said I used to housekeep there and at  Nutton Oh!
Did you?
And I sa , I was telling him, I said, cos I fo , I'm sure he  I'm sure he met Father Tom.
Oh I do , I'm not sure he has yet   in London.
No, they used to meet up.
Yeah?
Because  actually  the village of Keele  would be under  Nutton It's only the University that he's got  under his chaplaincy.
Oh!
The village would come under  Nutton 
Maybe.
So they cross paths slightly 
Ah yeah.
in that sense.
So they had met up.
But it would all come under  Newcastle really, because it was a parish.
Oh yes!
It it would all come 
It's the parish, yeah.
under the er
It's just a matter of er 
the area.
what do you call it?
Always was.
Even  Woolstaton was up to the  
But I mean if you count how many people were there when I went to mass when it was  a holy day.
Erm  how many thousands are up there, and of those thousands, how many mu , how many hundreds must be Catholic?
I don't know.
How many were there there?
Well I don't know.
Actually who stayed for mass  there was only about thirty.
And the catholic too?
Yeah.
They have their own choral society the Catholic church, and the Anglican church do.
But you got a chaplain, the erm  the chaplaincy of Keele, so it's like a united one, they have their own  choir, but the kee , the catholic one also have theirs.
Yeah.
A , oh dear!
What age is Father ?
About he's, I would say he's in his mid-sixties.
Mm.
Possibly slightly older.
They in there?
It's when they broke into er  near .
Between  the day after New Year and Sunday  stole a video recorder.
Mm!
Mm!
Mum!
What?
Do you know where my  is?
No.
It is!
You can carry that out!
What's that about res , wiring cables?

Anthony had one!
His didn't cost that much!
How much?

I've cut it so you can't have any 
What?
Hey I've only got one carrot left.
I'm eating my chicken first.
I'm eating my  first.
There you go, there's your bread.
Goodness you're eating that fast int you?
 
carrots yeah.
  

No that's a piece, that's a sandwich piece,watch that programme?
Erm  and played games.
We played this thing called Octopus.
Mm.
Well one, one person is the octopus  but you have to  like  mm then she had to, this person has to try and tick everybody  and 
And kick everybody?
Tick everybody
Oh tick everybody.
bu and when you  it you have to stand in one place going like that and being, and if you touch anybody else  and do that and try and get all the people.
Can you move your feet?
No.
You can 
D d they get 
People run around you and past you do they?
Yeah.
Simon did they get you?

Yeah they got me and I had to turn into one of them octopus things.
And then you can get changed back to normal?
No  you can't get 
But  till everybody, does that, does it carry on like that until everybody's
Mm.
turned into an octopus?
And what else do you play?
Erm  there is one called erm Dracula.
 
like  like one person is chosen and some  and one of  chooses somebody to say someone's name 
 
and that, and the Dracula has to go towards that person but if that person says someone's else's name before you get them
Yeah?
they  that has to go over to there, so 
Instead.
  

And who was there, was Daniel there?
Mm.
And Jesse?
Yeah.
And Rachel.
Yeah.
And you.

No, we know Jesse.
And who runs it?
Who's in charge?
Jesse?
Erm  
No.
Was it a friend of Barbara's?
I think so.
Is it a lady that's,ar are there ladies that aren't an aren't friends of Barbara's?
Most of them  aren't they?
Yeah.
And did you find out what you do next week?
No, you don't know what you're doing next week.
Oh.
Could always ask  then you'd know.
And what time are you going to the pantomime tomorrow?
Do you know?
Erm  It doesn't matter cos  when you're going now.
Oh right.?
What can I take?
Well you were going to take a satsuma and some Quavers weren't you?
Yeah.
We haven't got a satsuma, what about a pear, packet of Quavers and a pear?
Do you like pears or
Yeah.
find a packet of Quavers somewhere there.
Can I go?
No they won't let you go, you'll be able to go next year with your school.
You know when you, you only just started your school didn't you after Christmas?
Yeah.
Well they'd already been to the pantomime at your school so you'll have to wait till next year now.
You'll be a bit bigger then.
Mum, will it be like that Cinderella  didn't stick to the story?
Er yeah, pantomime's usually are like that.
If you go to the New Vic you'll find a pantomime probably sticks, really sticks to a traditional story.
And they don't shout things like oh yes you are and oh you're not and oh yes you have and oh no you haven't.
But this'll be  do you remember the one we went to the other day?
Like  
Yeah.
They sometimes say rude things and that don't they?
Yeah  
Like hello I'm posh.
And then somebody'll sing some song that's completely unrelated to it
Mm like  
What were they singing?dee dum, dee dum dee dum dee dum    
Oh do you know what we sung today?
We sung  all things bright and beautiful 
all creatures great and small, all things wise and wo wonderful, the lord God gave them all.
He made their blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
He made their glowing colours he made their tiny wings  
glowing colours he made their tiny wings  
Mm.
Good job you have a hymn book.
Yeah you can't remember all the words.
would you?
What?
Well daddy was to have been with us for this wasn't he, for this meal?
Da we've got a hymn book.
Have you?
Yeah.
Does it say  School Praise on it?
The state of some of the hymn books at our school.
That's cos children have them.
Have you seen them?
No,wh what's wrong with them?
Darren's hasn't, no Paul's hasn't got a cover and it's all curled up.
Why hasn't he covered it?
Didn't he  cover it at home?
Dunno.
You used to take them home and cover them don't you?
Is yours covered?
Yeah.
With, with that plastic stuff.
Oh right.
are the stuff with the  papers going on  put  paper on some didn't we?
Mm.
And what sort of things did you do at school?
Who's that banging?
You.
What things did you do at school today?
I did all things like 
Yeah 
and them some sausages
What did you have for dinner?
Sausages
Mm.
He has sausages every day.
You're beginning to look like a sausage.
You mean a pig.
Smiles like a sausage, looks like a sausage 
my God he is a sausage.
I'm a sausage eater.
What else did you have with your sausage?
Did you have potatoes?
Nothing for our boy, just twenty five thousand sausages each day.
You didn't did you?
No no do you know what?
What I had?
No what?
What?
my sausages so I don't have anything except sausages.
I don't believe that.
I don't think Mr 
dinners.
No, I don't think Mr  would want you just to have sausages.
I'm not paying eighty five pence a day for you to eat sausages.
I, I wasn't really.
What did you have then?
Eighty five pence?
It isn't eighty five pence a day.
It is eighty five pence a day, yours is ninety pence so you'd better be even wiser with your choice.
Incidentally what have you had for dinner?
That's because you're  
S spaghet spaghetti rings and erm  
Not those cheese and potato things?
Oh something different was it?
it's just cheese 
I think you could probably eat that sausage .
Or are you, are you satiated with sausages?
I'm tired of seeing sausages.
I bet the sausages see you coming  oh no here's Alex, quick then, hide.
Mum can you  talk posh?
Can I talk posh?
What for?
Like, what like how?
Like  ooh I'm posh .
That's not how you talk posh is it?
Mm.
Do you mean  
 
Stop kicking.
Stop kicking.
I talk posh.
Ooh  
Like Mrs Thatcher.
Like Mrs Th le let's hear somebody do Mrs Thatcher then.
Impression of Mrs Thatcher?
Me, me, me 
Impression of Mrs 
Ooh I'm  poor.
I wish I was   
I'll do an impression of Prince Charles
Just a minute.
Go on.
Ooh ooh I'm posh, I'm   
Now okay let's have Prince Charles.
ha ha ha 
at school.
Mm.
No  Fiona  can do a great one of Christopher Watkins.
And what's that like?
Which one's Christopher Watkins?
 
 
The one that looks like a problem school boy
Mm.
with a knife?
He looks like 
Can you talk common like cockneys talk?
Dunno.
No it's , I mean I'm not very good at this   cor blimey  up the apples and pears  
Cor blimey, cor blimey 
That isn't supposed to be posh 
Who  
He hasn't eaten his sausage .
You haven't eaten your sausage.
I don't want it.
We, we haven't ate the stuffing.
Mum we haven't ate all the stuffing.
Er well  I left the stuffing cos I, I didn't think I'd left it in long enough, I put it in a bit late and I thought we'd leave the stuffing.
Why?
Have some stuffing next day.
You kicking?
Have you had enough to eat now?
Yeah 
Are you nearly ready for bed then?
No.
Good.
Have you shown Simon your picture that you've done at school?
I did a monster picture.
He's done a picture of a man with hair
No it's a monster.
He's done a picture of a man monster
No it's not a man  
Oh just a monster.
Mm.
It's got hair, eyes, nose and mouth  and it's got a big yellow sun, hasn't it, shining over and it's the  bestest picture you've ever seen since you last went to the art gallery.
Remember that one, that Picasso?
Mm.
Well it's much better than that, and this is something taken from one perspective int it?
And, and do you know how big it was?
It was this big.
How big?
This big.
That big.
It's big  as big as you.
a man, that big isn't he?
Yeah  that big.
Mm I suppose so, yeah.
Does it go from there up to the sky and up to there?
 
manage to eat that chicken.
What chicken?
Chicken will make you grow into a big strong boy.
What will?
Chicken.
You don't eat it.
What do you mean?
Chicken, if you eat chicken it makes you grow strong cos it's got protein in, if you  it makes you 
What?
it makes  
What?
so that your bones will grow.
What would happen if you didn't drink enough milk and you didn't get enough calcium and your bones didn't grow  but you kept eating lots of protein?
Mm I dunno.
Well you wouldn't be able to grow any 
A midget.
taller but you'd kind of grow out.
A midget?
Well  a sort of small, fat person probably.
But you couldn't get any  either 
Erm a mutant.
A mutant 
thre like three  three, six, nine, twelve  fourteen
Fifteen
four fifteen, eighteen
No.
twenty
Seven, twenty
twenty one
seven threes are?
Twenty one.
Correct.
Go on then, off you go.
twenty one ?
Have a look.
If twenty one's there then it's right isn't it?
I'll put that next to there then.
Yeah join it up to the sum  answers.
Cos seven threes are?
Twenty one.
Twenty one.
You could do the arrow going from the figures to the answer, from the sum to the answer not from the answer to the sum really doesn't it?
Just think next time you do it.
Okay you know you're looking for eight threes, what are eight threes?
Count in threes 
Seven 
on your finger.
Well that one was 
Right.
Seven threes were twenty one 
Twe twenty er   twenty one, twenty two  twenty four.
Eight threes are twenty four, you're getting better aren't you?
See next time you have tables at school you'll be able to show them how it's done.
Eight threes are twenty four, that's an easy one but what's the next one?
Three threes are?
Three  Six.
Nine, nine, nine.
You're getting there, go on, three threes are nine.
Now that was five threes.
Oh.
It doesn't matter.
Put, put the nine going to the three threes, I'll understand, possibly.
Three threes are nine, so what are five threes then?
Just ignore that one.
Just ignore that one.
Okey-doke.
I'll cross that out like that.
So what are five 
so that one's  wrong.
Mhm.
Five threes are?
One more.
There's one more 
Well you've got five threes are  and twelve threes are, you've only got two figures left, so which is  to which?
five threes are thirty six and twelve threes are fifteen.
No it's fifteen.
It's fifteen.
Five threes are fifteen, right.
Oh!
That's alright, yeah.
Er I, I know what, as long as I can see what you've done.
And twelve threes?
Thirty six.
Thirty six, do you wanna check that on your fingers?
You've got twelve fingers   lend you two.
Okey- doke, go on then.
wrong with this.
Twelve divided by three
put things over the top
No you put it behind the equals sign.
You would if it was a proper division sum but you've actually put the equals sign there.
Three er is it just like that?
No they're multiplications  
How many threes in twelve.
Right, how many threes in twelve?
Could you lend me two fingers?
Go on!
You don't need three, you don't need two fingers.
Twelve fingers .
C you're counting i no, you're counting in threes  three, six 
Three, six, nine, twelve  four.
Right, four threes are twelve, you don't need twelve fingers for that  count each finger as three cos you're counting in threes.
Twenty one.
Three, six, nine, twelve  fourteen si 
Fifteen.
fif fift fourt fifteen
Yeah.
eighteen, twenty 
Eighteen 
twenty one
twenty one.
ah  seven.
Seven.
You ge you forget yourself don't you and you go back to the two times table, we're on threes now.
Well this one's just the sa are these just the same?
That's easy-peasy that one, three into three goes  three into three goes 
three  I had trouble with this one last night though.
Eleven times table that one is.
I know it is.
Three into thirty three?
Count on your fingers, I'll lend you, you'll need a finger, I'll lend you one.
Three, six, nine, twelve  fourteen
Well you've got ten fingers and if I'm gonna  
eighteen 
lend you one that's eleven.
Carry on.
eighteen, twenty  twenty one  twenty four
Yeah.
twenty seven
Yeah.
Twenty seven.
thirty 
Thirty
thirty one.
No, you're on thirty there because ten threes are thirty, you want another three, what's that?
Thirty three.
Thirty three, how many fingers?
Eleven.
Eleven, right, because eleven threes are thirty three.
Thirty three divided by eleven is three, thirty three divided by three is eleven.
The whole thing is interchangeable  divisions to multiplications.
Eighteen  and divide by three again 
Correct.
Three into eighteen  in other words.
Three, six nine, twelve  fourteen, eighteen 
Fifteen.
fifteen, eighteen  eighteen   twenty, oh  
No the answer isn't eighteen.
Do it again.
Three, six
Three, six, nine, twelve, fourteen
Fifteen.
fifteen, eighteen  six.
Six, because six times three makes
Eighteen.
Correct.
And three times six makes eighteen.
Twenty seven divided by three.
And eighteen i and eighteen divided by three makes six.
Correct.
And eighteen divided by six is three.
And three twelve  and three er divided by twelve equals four, four divided by three equals twelve  and three divided by four 
No, no, no no no no no no, four times three equals twelve.
Three di three times four is fifteen 
Oh.
You mean I've been doing them wrong all the way?
No they're fine, you've just got to  sort out what the difference is.
All these there are multiplications and you can change them to divisions.
Yeah but I've gotta know how many threes in them.
Yeah that's division.
When you divide something by three  how many threes.
But that was multiplied.
See with the crosses  well that's multiplication.
And it actually says here look.
But why can't you just put one over the top there or something?
That means division  that's what, you've done them right, they're divisions but  three into twelve goes four  but at the same time four times three is twelve, you can change it into a multiplication but it, it doesn't start off as one.
Is  you've got, are these divides?
These are all divides all the way down  but you can change them all because you say four threes are twelve, seven threes are twenty one
Three, six, nine, twelve
Correct.
fourteen  three, six, nine, twelve  fourteen
fifteen  eighteen, twenty  twenty one  twenty four  twenty seven
Because  twenty seven 
nine 
divided by three equals nine.
nine nine nine nine nine.
Oh you're just doing the sums in different ways.
Well I ain't doing them, the book's doing them, it's different ways of showing division, you can do a divide sign, you could write the word 
How many more have I got left out of these?
you could put one over the other.
You've got one, two  you tell me, you're the ones that doing the maths.
Nine, nine , three, six, nine  three.
Right.
Three threes are nine.
Three threes are nine.
Nine divided by three makes three.
Three, six, nine, twelve,fif thirty six  twelve, it's twelve  twenty
How you doing?
eight  
Have you been chinking like this all the time I've been gone?
Mm.
Right.
I multiplied
But in actual fact, although it's something multiplied by something, it gives you the answer.
Mum come and look at my man.
If you t if you divide some it'll be easier.
Mum, come and look at my man, he's dead funny.
Which one's this?
Yeah look, it's nine.
The man on the computer.
In a minute, can I come just now 
Is it nine?
I'm just doing something at the moment 
Is it nine?
with Alex.
Yes that's right, three times nine is twenty seven, yes.
Alright sometimes you see a pattern don't you?
But you see if you make it as a, a division it makes it easier.
Thirty six  six 
You say to yourself how many times does three go into twenty seven, nine.
You've got to learn how to change the sums round.
Is this is this  thirty six.
I'm afraid, no eighteen divided by
We'll have to treat it as a 
three.
multiplier
Yeah, so how many times does three go into eighteen?
Is it is it 
It isn't a multiplication.
eighteen divided  eighteen divided 
Divided by something equals three.
Which is just the same as saying eighteen divided by three equals something.
So put three into eighteen and see what the answer is, cos that's the answer.
Three eigh how many threes in eighteen, yeah 
Three, six, nine, off you go 
Three, six nine and twelve  four fifteen
You've got it.
eighteen, eighteen.
There you go it's 
Six.
taught you something hasn't it?
Six.
Taught you that in the three times table fourteen doesn't come after twelve.
Four multiplied by blah equals twelve.
Four multiplied by something equals twelve.
Blah  twelve
In other words 
Ah how many 
how many times does four go into twelve.
How many fours in twelve.
I mean we are doing a certain times table 
How many fours in twelve.
How many fours in twelve?
Okay.
Four
S I can't
No you're back i that's because you're stuck in your three times mode.
Count in three times table then
Three, six, nine  three, six 
Nine
nine
mhm
twelve
Twelve, right.
So this is three times table  or
Can't keep that  
times three makes twelve.
Three times four makes twelve, four times three makes twelve.
Yeah.
That's it.
Four
It's not four  because you counted up, you counted the three times table
It's er how many fours in twelve you said.
Yeah, but  there are four threes in twelve.
Right.
So how many fours are there?
If there are four 
Three 
Right, there are three fours 
I told you these are mad.
You just change it round, that's all it is.
A mu oh another one.
How many threes in thirty six 
You have to sometimes learn to do a bit of guesswork with maths, you're doing 
How many threes in thirty six?
Dear oh what's that?
Is that a car going past?
It's the American  
Alex, could you leave mine alone Alex.
This one's mine.
Could you leave my  alone now.
Well let's get these finished.
Right three multiplied by something equals thirty six.
What do you have to multiply by three to get thirty six?
Three 
How many of what?
three times something makes thirty six.
Three of what makes thirty six 
Yes.
Correct.
Start counting  on your fingers.
Three, six, nine  twelve, can you lend me a few fingers?
Mhm
Mum
Yes?
Fifteen eighteen, twenty one 
can,
twenty four, twenty seven  thirty
Thirty.
thirty three  thirty six  thirty six
Thirty six.
How many  
twelve.
Twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve 
Twelve threes make thirty six.
Mum could you help me  
Three multiplied by twelve makes thirty six.
I think that's had it, I think the er man from customs    Simon was saving that, the man took it all apart  and I think that's why it probably got broken so quickly because I think they messed with it.
Could you help me fix it?
I don't think you can.
I don't think the people that work in, in customs are very bright, I think they also steal things  cos we've had things go missing haven't we?
Careful of that .
I can't fix it Alex er I don't, oh hang on, why don't we just leave those two pieces out, see if we can fix it without them.
Yeah but that's bent  to one side.
Oh right, you mean it's broken in more ways than  we previously thought.
The twenty seven times table!
No!
Twenty seven divided by something
How many twenty seven 
equals nine.
how many  twenty sevens in nine do you mean?
I don't mean how twenty se many twenty sevens in nine, I mean how many of those  blank, in twenty seven
or how many nines.
How many nines, or nine of how many  make twenty seven.
Mum
If you put nine into twenty seven how many does it go?
Say the nines you can do in the three times table  and that er you've got to get a three in 
Three six, nine, twelve 
somewhere.
I think it's had it Alex.
twelve  fifteen, eighteen, twenty one, twenty four, twenty seven  thirty, thirty 
No you you've gone too far.
Oh!
Twenty seven  nine.
Nine what?
Nine  nine 
Nine nines make twenty seven?
But  I've got nine  
You've got nine  nine what?
Threes.
No three's right.
Three.
Correct, yeah .
You're doing
Mum 
I can't mend it Alex, it's broken.
You see you're doing it 
Twenty one.
Right 
   

Do you know you're doing the three times table?
Is eight three, is that multiplied by three twenty one?
   
Eight, no eight times three is twenty four.
It was when I was at school.
mum why did they take it to pieces  ?
twenty one  
Because they do things like that at customs because they're looking, they're always looking for drugs and things that shouldn't come in.
Se well seven, seven mul 
You're lucky that they didn't take the Turtles apart, they didn't open them.
Is seven multiplied by three twenty one?
It might be that it was just a little bit open and they think that somebody's tampered with it so then they, they open  
Se is it twenty one divided by  seven ?
Yeah.
Twenty one divided by seven.
Seven divided by  
 
Mum when are you gonna read me my story ?
I'm going to read you your story now.
Yeah, the story of your life before  
Tt  he's lovely for you int he, your brother?
No they're my     
I, I've got a ray in there  that gives me pow that can give me power Alex.
Watch this one, it's really good.
Yeah, it can dig
Yeah, you can that out of your 
Go on then.
see there, and he  digged 
Oh my God.
and he digged through there 
Honest?
Well how did you find out that cos you haven't got any instructions have you?
I just did it and he appeared.
He digs through there for you.
That's good of him.
Oh and then you can just follow him through?
No he, he just disappears when you've got through.
Oh he's a kind of, he gets released for favours done.
Yeah.
But you've managed to get so many exciting things going.
I, don't  
Get a ray  
get a ray sign  
They can't do anything though Alex, the rays can't do anything.
I only manage to get one thing on I do
ah I don't know.
Why don't you have a try of this ?
Can I have a try?
Simon can I have a try?
Simon can I have a try ?
Watch this, I can do this on  too, there he is 
You can't though.

Mum look he's jumping all  
You can make one of these little pink things appear with one of them 
Oh right 
so they jump around.

I just found out about it now .
I've got some, you get one of each thing  
a better game now isn't it, altogether?
You get all them animals and everything.
Yeah you get one of each kind when you start.
So I've got a ray in there I think.
 
 
Let's just see what I've got.
I've got one fly, one pink thing, one ray, one of them creatures, the diggers and erm a thing, I don't what they're for though.
Get another digger, get that digger there.
I don't know what them fly things are for.
I just don't know what they're for.
five more minutes  
I is he digging for you?
Yes.
No I'm not gonna make him dig for me yet.
I'm gonna try and get a few more of them that can dig.
Whoo!
And then they can dig a few holes for you.
Hey see that little pink thing.
So try and get that  wish I  could get through that.
If I can get another one of them.
Like that one?
Well jump up here and try and get one.
I caught it.
I'd better get another one now.
I think I'll be able to get another one.
Three of them big diggers.
only a tiny spot cos that's 
Can I?
cider.
Can I?
A tiny little drink.
Cider isn't that bad though.
Well it's  strong enough for little boys.
Ah ah!
It is nice.
I, I had a lot or something,a little lot.
Oh you had a little lot did you?
Put the light on 
No.
Go on, the other side.
Okay Si.

I'll go back down  then I'll see what they'll both do.
 

He hasn't dug out yet.
Why?
Out of where?
Oh eh I c I can't catch one of them.
I've got lots of stuff in there 
Wonder what they do it for 
They're just in there.

Come on  come on, come on.
Hey!
Oh he just fell off getting the, I've transported him back somewhere.
I've transported him.
Oh can, can I have a go?

Yeah.
Pull it down and then pull it.
  

Don't you want,that?
Can I er  oh can I have a go?
Simon's taking all the  
Alright, I think er Simon  had your ten minutes, it's Alex's turn.

Yes
See?
Oh!
It appears.
Yeah they appear.

You can get them to dig for you, in this other rule, you can get them to dig through the wall.
And you can't get through the wall.
See they dig 
Oh!
How do you, well how do you manage to do that?
I just caught something for a, then put them on.
What do you s oh yeah, oh I see what you 
When you get one of them you just jump around.
I see what you mean, when you've caught them you can then make 
I into there you can erm

Yeah
Yeah.
Well where's it gone?
Where's that one you just had?

So you  so  is it more fun finding out how 
Yeah 
I want a go .
You want a go as well?

library so  as possible I suppose.
 

Mum
mum  mum, mum, mum, mum  
microwave  all morning, warmed it up.
mum, mum   
You see what happens is people show up  all dressed up in their togs and whatever  from school, or maybe, maybe, maybe they're power dressing
No point really.
Well, no, one has to bear in mind  the type of situation, so power dressing as in it might be a tool but it's very very professional.
Mum, can you do one of these ?
And then the professional arrives and what's the professional dressed in?
Jeans and T-shirt.
Denims!
Especially jeans and a denim jacket, while the teachers  
Did you feel a bit uncomfortable in jeans?
because, yeah well I thought I might and then he said something about  I was at this meeting where I was talking to all these official in their suits and ties and I was only dressed casual  and I thought, at that point I sort of 
a bit like that, it 
I thought great, I thought, I thought everybody else sort of cringe about the way  that maybe they  were over power dressed.
   

Over and out.
these forms.
I wanted, I wanted 
I don't know where it is.
Alex was   I think.
No I wasn't!
Well can I just ask, there was,th there were four  there were four of the rock and roll ones  and the piece up there that wanted to going back on, have you thrown that bit away Alex?
No.
Don't think they have.
Eh?
I don't think 
Well what have you done,
That was Simon!
I don't care whose it was.
We well Simon done it.
I haven't done it.
I haven't, I haven't.
I haven't.
Yeah well it's always strange isn't it how nobody manages to do it and yet it's always  
Well I haven't!
Well who took the piece that was on there, that was stuck on?
Has it fell somewhere?
I don't know.
No it's been torn off.
Oh.
I told them not to 
I want  or the rock and roll one.
I only wanted the four rock and roll ones.
Garry  
 
anything.
Oh can I have a go ?
Still got one on the, just a minute.
Simon  
Simon.
What?
Alex now.
Alex now Simon.
I want, I'm just saying to you what I want to do  I actually want to consolidate my own qualifications
Ah, a bit missing there.
Yeah?
Don't worry it's all  
Oh it's there it's there.
yeah, okay.
It's there.
And what I want to do is, as the moment where I'm going in and teaching in the area that I am I don't mind the learning support bit, I don't mind the fact  that the chil er the, the , yeah, yeah
Dad 
You don't want  
Oh you're not allowed to stick that on are you?
No, I'm gonna take this off.
You were saying?
But er 
What about that bit?
Yeah don't worry there, I won't push it off.
I've thought it out Simes and now I'm going to apply  a bit of thought so it'll keep that on, yeah?
And I can stick it back down.
No ju just saying that I'm looking for material that would be of interest to the kids 
Your kids?
that would allow them, from a, a graphics point of view 
 
that would be of interest, sort of allow them  not only to be interested but would, would show them a variety of graphic design  based on similar ideas.
I was just saying to Simon remember when I did, I did this, before these came out I did the Fab Four Rock and Roll Beatles
Mm
and there you go, you've got them.
What's that?
. Let me stick me other bits and pieces 
I don't think it'll erm  there, there!
Well it'll repair okay.
Goes like that doesn't it?
As long as nobody's ripped all the little bits off.
Yeah?
I don't think anybody has really.
No I think it's er 
I think he'll be  
anyway you they w he was say 
it might just have a bit here
he was saying, John, that he was so excited  mind you, what I want to know is how excited was mum when they arrived?
You weren't excited?
I just said, goodness, I said we've been waiting for this parcel since before Christmas and he says oh have you duck.
Mm I mean he looked at me like I was a bit silly and it was only when I got it and looked he'd got after Christmas written    
No explanations from the Post Office as to  it doesn't actually say on, it doesn't say on it 
Ah but I think, I was saying I think they've I think they've tested them at customs.
Did you think  well I, I'm not 
I think they must have opened
it doesn't say on that customs actually have opened them.
And it normally has stickers all over it saying 
Perhaps they just have opened them.
Mm.
I don't know it was just a thought.
So   
Mind you if customs had opened it it probably would never have got  maybe  
Although he 
fancied them for their own kids.
Yeah but it is, it was ins it was an insured package so 
Can I see if this'll just
Yeah.
Right.
Just take, just take it carefully.
Now this is, you know that you don't 
Now there's a letter in there that wants filling in for Alex for Alison.
We are restoring this.
Yeah.
Yeah but I filled it, I've botched it up in a couple of places but that's beside the point, it doesn't matter.
Dad.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Just need a bit there first.
Probably when they see I'm at  Keele they'll know I'm stupid anyway.
Well, what's that?
Why what have you done with the er 
Nothing.
I just put a few things in the wrong place because I didn't read, you know, put them in too soon.
It doesn't matter anyway, I mean I put er
Well but if you've ju yeah but if you just said, I mean what, you s you did that when Sue was here.
Yes I know, that's what I'm saying.
You said straight, no but straight , you filled something in then you 
Yeah I realized straight away yeah.
But you said I'm not reading it, well why did you carry on if that was the case?
You said to me, the point you said
That was it, that was where I went wrong.
Oh!
Well tha well  oh well that's alright, it was only that it'd be  I thought you said there was a place for your name and address that hadn't been filled in by the computer so you filled it in?
That's right, so I filled it in because that's what you do if you get stuck on  Keele you fill in the bits that the computer hasn't 
Well that seems fair enough fo 
sort of filled in.
Is Alex's alright?
We'll have to do something with Alex's cos that thing's still on the front.
Yeah well don't  
So anyway you just want to sign by you, I've put your school and I've put your telephone number 
Mum 
and I've put, no you can't  my number and   Keele and I, I've put nanny's number.
Oh  
Mm.
It just needs you to sign it.
No tomorrow night there's a P T A at Allyson Street.
Oh yeah 
Well Annette said are you going, and I said well  we thought perhaps 
Why, did they say they they would go if we would go?
The, what?
Is that  is that what you think?
Allyson Street P T A I'm talking about, tomorrow.
Yeah I know, that's what I'm saying, but did it
Well she said I'd sort of thought of going, are you going, I says yeah okay I said, if you won't go I'll, we'll go together, I said but I don't particularly want to get, you know, roped into it at the moment.
I don't mind going to show me face.
 
it doesn't ma Yeah 
You know but just perhaps, perhaps occasional help  and then maybe a bit later on get more involved.
I don't want to not be in it but I don't want to, you know
Have over-involvement.
well I, well I've got enough on at the moment.
Yeah.
What have you done?
Anyway then I said are they interested in this quiz night, and she says I haven't go she says she'd ask Jan, I said well give me a ring back a bit later.
Anyway sh she phoned me back and she said yes he was, he was dead keen, he wished it'd've just been like pop quiz  but he'll go anyway.
So it's Thursday the twenty seventh.
So I said we'll get out tickets  and they'll get their tickets tomorrow, we're gonna get our tickets separately.
It says there's sandwiches on and it's at the Oxford Arms so
Yeah.
Thursday 
Thursday the twenty seventh.
the twenty seventh.
It's the day after er F S A.
Yeah okay, well I was gonna say  
And you won't be able to go to the F S A anyway cos you're on your course.
Which F S A?
Well it's an F S A or a governor's meeting or something up St Margarets.
On the, on the notice board?
Does it say F S A on a, is on the 
I can't think, it was something to do with St Margarets, it was either an F S A or a governor's meeting.
Thing is you can't go anyway.
The governor's thing is coming about quite useful tonight because we've been talking about the law as regards governors and parents' rights and what you're supposed to ask parents 
Parents' what?
Parents' rights, yeah.
Not such a thing as parents' rights is there?
That the parents are allowed to, to actually opt their children out of certain things.
But they can only do that if they're actually away that they, they are aw that they can actually do it.
certain things in the first place.
If nobody damn well tells them in the first place that they can opt out then  they can't opt out can they?
There's no point at a later date saying oh by the way you do realize that  that show we gave on AIDS 
Yeah.
so in actual fact your child didn't have to go if you didn't want to because 
Well that's like sex education and stuff isn't it?
You can vote no to sex education can't you?
Well it comes under sex education.
Yeah but there were some people who didn't realize that.
I mean I we I would I, you know, personally I think I prefer to do it myself than put th leave it up to them cos mostly they don't know what they're on about anyway.
Well this,th this, these are the points we were discussing er that appropriate  appropriate  
Push forward the morals and the philosophy of the Conservative government.
Well you wanna read the, you wanna read the paper 
Like AIDS is a nasty disease that only homosexuals get.
Well  this is all part and parcel of it because  apparently it's now  
It's to do with moral it'll be a moral thing won't it?
it's to er encourage people to do 
Take a moral view point.
to have erm, oh I've forgotten what the terms are now  anyway, yes, it was very much a Thatcherite family view 
This is that new thing isn't it?
Oh well it's always protection of the family and yet they're not prepared to put anything to the family.
That's what  
Decent respectable citizens on the lowest budget you can  make available.
Well that's that's really what this whole thing was about  tonight, and that's what we're tackling.
No, I think er I think it 
We've had to d 
it might be something worth pulling kids out of.
Well
Cos  
that's what I tried to say to people, that  if you want to be an informed parent then you want to know fully who's doing it, what, you want to know the content, you want 
And what the qualifications are,
you want to know the content and you want to know the delivery 
Well surely won't we have to have a meeting on that just like,do don't they have a meeting for sex education?
They should do but you, er again the reality of it as, as we know
Seem to remember our sex education talk wasn't very s specific  and didn't cover a very wide area.
No.
It doesn't cover the important things.
I think it was mostly, you know, just meant for females of a certain age, it wasn't really anything to do with anything else.
What cos only women get pregnant?
No that's it, don't think it was anything to do with p it was all about periods and sanitary protection and stuff like that.
Oh well there you go.
There you go, it 
never mentions the condom.
doesn't even have anything  anything to do with sex does it really ?
Well that was our talk.
I don't think, mind you we had biology so we didn't need it.
No but biology is just purely clinical isn't it?
Yeah, well no, well we did, that's what I'm saying 
I mean they'll do nothing about sex, they'll just do all about morals, won't they, and decent, respectable people I'd say and biology's just cold and clinical.
Well no 
Mum 
but that's what we were discussing.
That's w 
Int it?
we, were discussing, for instance 
They need to have somebody that's a bit liberal and a bit open and that won't be available under a Conservative government will it?
What's what's the aim we've been telling them 
 
is the aim, what, I mean somebody came up with the aim, in actual fact, despite whatever else you might be doing, whatever politics were behind it, the aim was to prevent AIDS no matter what you were doing, and not to have any kind of  prejudice against what you were doing as long as  the aim 
It's also in support of the nuclear family though int it?
One mummy and one daddy bound 
It was, yeah 
together for the rest of their lives, and no  
Yeah.
relationships.
Well no but that's what this, this  talk on  is about  is er  well I forget the paper  
Have we got a loony left council round here, we have haven't we?
No.
Anyway,th the guy we had tonight reckoned that er he never quite got to grips with er Bernstein and he's f and he, he apologized for being stuck in restrictive    which er he couldn't even remember that it was called restrictive  until somebody told him but he said ah yes that's it, but yes I never managed to  he said  I never managed to really get very far  with that.
Very er very  very nice  fella and very, put us very much at ease.
Erm  good.
The first fella is a bit er I, I think is  is very academic or has a very ac academic 
Were there two fellas?
Yeah.
The first fella was ver no there's, there's some women on the course w er we will see who are actually presenting the course, I mean  a good fifty percent of the course is 
Dad 
it's ab I think I said to you we've got  fifty, a good fifty-fifty split, if maybe not slightly more women  actually on the course.
Oh on the course,education int it?
Erm Well I don't know, it's er  Yes 
Dad 
Simon?
could you take these off ?
I can have a go but er like I said to you
Have most of them teaching ?
Whose bits are these?
Alex's.
I was using them.
Right.
So can you no well can you bear that in mind when Alex is sometimes playing with your things?
Mm.
And bear in mind also that  the more you take them off the more you bend them whatever and  yeah?
You pull them don't you?
Well I think that's the intention but  as you know  it says M in there
What?
M for Michael Angelo
Oh.
I assume.
Don't know,
Now who's phoned?
Oh Barbara phoned to see about woodcraft, she said Steve had, or  well either her or Steve'd take them.
That being , yeah?
Anyway Steve picked them up here.
I said to her do you think 
That's mine.
there's any chance of picking them up here, said otherwise I'm going to have to her take Alex late.
That's  
Anyway Steve picked them up here and then dropped them off  
 

And then who else rang?
Rob, Rob  Robert  Rob or Robert from Quickprint, Robert 
Oh yeah?
Bob.
Bob.
No Bob, it wasn't 
Oh Rob from Quickprint?
Rob, yeah.
Yeah?
He said you'd had two more fax, one of them they just wanted a current catalogue
Yeah?
and he seemed to think the other one wanted to buy something but he,whe whether he couldn't read the writing or he didn't understand it 
Mm sometimes the faxes are pretty  
Something about a bootleg.
Could you get hold of a bootleg,bu but he didn't seem to know  I don't know what else he said about it.
I'll have to call in, I'll have to make a 
Well I sa I said can he contact you later and he says well no not really, I said well I'll tell him to give you a ring in the day some time tomorrow.
See I can't do that at all from  school, that's 
Oh.
that's the trou no that's the trouble now you see 
Oh you'll have to just try and call in but 
so all I can possibly do is
after school  
I s well I wanna get a photocopy of that jacket, so I thought  if I, Friday night  which I should be home pretty, pretty much on the dot  I'll have to pick the, pick these two up and I'll have to just go run down before they close.
Yeah?
Well you could do, yeah.
Well I'll have to really.
I'm thinking I finish at three tomorrow but then I'll have to get home, Annette, I said to Annette I'd be there by about four
Yeah.
but I, I don't know er whether I could do it an hour or not.
It's possible I could s if I walk from Newcastle  catch a bus to Newcastle then walk from Newcastle.
that other one Simes?
just take er  
asleep now but erm could I go and get it?
He probably is asleep actually.
Oh did he take it upstairs?
I think he did take something  
It's alright I was just getting rid of all these  
Anyway so it's the P T A tomorrow and I said I'll go 
Do you want me to go and get them  
er but we neither of us want to be
What time is the P T A?
to do anything, half seven tomorrow night.
What are we going to do about a babysitter?
You're, you're not going  only me and Annette are going.
Oh sorry, right.
Fine.
Sorry about that.
Right, right 
No you're getting the other thing on a Thursday  the quiz night, twenty seventh.
Annette and John are going 
We're both going  
Well it's a night out.
Sandwiches  
 
So it's two pound anyway so if you've got four quid spare  between us.
Erm 
I've got a ten pound note  I suppose.
Did you say there was something on telly you wanted to watch?
something really intellectual.
five more minutes.
Were they, were they very pleased with the parcel?
Did they seem
Oh yes, they were a bit pleased but straight away they started getting, you know Alex was getting tired so we were getting can I get it out, can I get this out, can I get that  and it were half open and I was frightened of losing the bits  so I gave him one and he said no he didn't want that one he wanted the other one, so I give him another one  and then I nearly gave him a clout.
Well what I'll do I'll get, I'll get a bigger box
Part of it's erm which I thought actually, I shouldn't really  three of them each, you know he was getting silly  
Yes I know but they are his  
What he  you mean he chose his own?
No.
He chose his own?
No they came 
Before I even  
no, no, we chose  there were three in a parcel for you and three  
Cos if he did
No there were 
that wouldn't have been fair.
No, Don Don  Don 
Nothing's ever fair for you is it?
There were three in the pack 
 
 
No, there were three in a pack for Alex and he opened his bef you opened yours Simon.
No.
That was it, that was how it came, nothing was touched at all.
Don and Debbie sent them as they were.
Except Don and Debbie sent three pairs of pants, that game with the  punchy  springing thing
Which broke.
and there was a talking 
And Alex   
a talking turtle and a book,both got a talking turtle each and it
Which one was it?
M er Michael Angelo.
And it wasn't anything specific, it was just a turtle but  thought perhaps Robert might like it.
I offered to give it to Daniel actually for his birthday  but I, I fe I felt a bit sorry for Robert, I thought o opening all them.
He gives you things sometimes doesn't he?
And takes things off you sometimes .
Yeah.
Have you heard what he's done on him today?
Tell dad what he done on you.
No, tell us what's he done on you today?
Well
well I was   I'll go and get it.
I said  he'll get .
He has actually given Alex one, he give him a ,is it?
Cos Simon wasn't 
Oh one of the 
pleased about that cos he hasn't got that one.
One of the monsters in my pocket?
The old ones, the  one.
This was the cause of it all wasn't it?
Go on, tell dad what happened.
Tell me what happened then.
Well we were on the bus and
Which bus?
Er to swimming
Coming from swimming, going swimming.
and no back from swimming
Yes?
and I had erm  hmm I'd swapped Richard something
Richard ?
No Richard  thingy, Richard 
Richard ?
No  
Yeah  
and  I swapped him this elephant
Yeah
it's an elephant
Yes
you know  Gnicia 
 Gnicia 
Yeah, the god.
Oh right the In the, the, the In the In 
 
I hadn't heard of it at all, don't know what  
I was gonna say the Indian one, yeah.
And I asked Robert if I could have a er have a look at one of these
Yeah.
one of his in a set and he says
Yeah.
that I could and he, and he gets 
Were you keen on the one you looked at?
Did you want to see it?
Was it really an interesting  
I only wanted to see this one and he said 
Is that it?
and when he had a look at mine he said no swaps back
Ah.
we hadn't even swapped.
Took one off him and said no swaps back.
You see it's all to do with being fair and
I shouldn't worry too much.
and doing the same 
But I don't want this one.
and doing the
Well swap it for another one.
I can't, he won't swap me.
Well think, swap it with somebody else.
Somebody else.
I want to swap, nobody else has got that one.
Which one?
The elephant.
 Gnish 
 Gnicia 
 Gnicia Well the thing is Simes
Swap it for that  
that's what it's all about isn't it?
Okay, if I give him the turtle  do you think he'd 
And that.
No way!
I'm not giving it away!
You don't want that one.
You just said.
I do, I  well if  if I 
swap him that and said here I'll give 
if I give him the turtle 
you this turtle as an incentive cos you're giving him the turtle anyway but he won't know that unless his mum's told him.
Bet she has though.
I'm confused.
Are you confused?
You will be.
Anyway, Simes, the Golden Girls are on, which is full of intellectual stimulation for dads  so I'm afraid I'm gonna put the T V on now.
Old er old American women.
Old  American women .
I can put these trousers on straight away.
Go on then, let's have a look and see how nicely you can put your trousers on.
Where's the 
At the front, and the zip's at the front as well.
What that?
That's right.
Mum why did I bump into a chair?
Why, when did you bump into a chair?
And I knocked it over.
You should be looking where you were going.
shoes.
Why should I bump into
Go on, carry on, that's it.
Mum somebody put sand in my pockets.
Somebody put sand in your pocket?
Where was that, from school?
Yeah.
Another boy was it ?
Yeah this 
This dead , dead what   
He's dead.
He's dead is he?
Will, you mean he will be if he puts sand in your pockets again?
Is he your friend?
Well that was silly thing to do really wasn't it?
You don't put sand in people's pockets do you?
I know 
You mean you never put sand in his pockets?
What?
You never put sand in his 
Get your own ba do you play in sand at school still?
Does it take, do they take you, you haven't got sand in your play room have you, in your classroom?
No.
Well where, how did  you have got sand in your classroom?
Yeah but, but I never saw it, oh no.
Oh right, so where is it, up a corner?
Cos there's not a lot of room in your classroom is there?lot of room 
Do you know what, there's so much room.
desks and the tables and all the children.
I thought you had to go off to another room, to a play room  to play in the sand?
There's all water as well.
Is there?
What do you do in the water?
What sort of things do you do?
There you go, you can put your clothes on now.
They're in the same room.
They've got sand and water in their playground daddy.
In their 
What?
in their classroom.
Uncomfortable.
You're uncomfortable?
Alright.
I bet they do put it out in the 
They don't.
Simes  how, don't leave that lying around so put it on the side when you've finished.
then you could play, you cold splash couldn't you?
You can.
it wouldn't matter where the water went.
Have you zipped your zip, yeah?
Where's your tie now?
Put your tie on 
I've got  
Okay right.
Well pull that right up like that  your collar so your collar sticks up.
No put your tie on so it goes over your collar    that's right, now it goes over your ti over your shirt collar at the back   and then that's it but you'll have to, you'll have to do it yourself soon, you know
Can you pull it down?
No you've got it down, you flap the collar back down again.
And at the back, cos it's very stiff, you need to turn it right over.
Oh there you go, Simon's brought your shoes as well.
Put your shoes on.
Simon, if you wear my shoes   
Yes?
Yeah.
And I'll let you look at that thing with  
Okay?
Yeah.
I know it's twelve minutes past   I need extra few minutes.
Go on then.
Daddy's going now 
Kiss boys.
kisses.
Hey, have a nice day   Alex 
Alex, you're 
Be good boys.
Have a nice day at the theatre.
Alex, I'm not going.
Simon.
You're not?
Course I'm going.
Yes I will.
I'm just having one with no weapons 
Yeah.
No don't you take it    used to have one little   
I think I'll have a pink face.
What?
I think this is the best turtle.
It's not the best turtle ever.
Do you know the best turtle?
Mine is.  you said.
This one's just like  er   cos they've got them little round things.
this one's trousers.
No they're just like jeans aren't they?
Yeah.
your weapons that they have.
Come on boys, let's brush your hair.
Have you both got your shoes on?
Yeah.
You've got about fifteen minutes  to play for fifteen minutes now, then we have to go ut.
Why do they have to have  weapons that they have?
These are just the real weapons.
I bet Alex wishes he was going to the pantomime today.
You'll have to go another time won't you?
Yeah, cos them aren't really weapons are they?
They're just things  
Er is that one Leonardo?
Yeah.
Raphael.
The other one's  
Simon, do you  on their arms, very often, them little  
You do, you do you do.
Right.
Simon  let's get on, you see that turtle?
Give that to Robert, that's for Donna  so give them both to Robert but the adventure game's for Donna.
There's your crisps.
And that's yours as well.
Can I bring one ?
Can I can I bring ?
Can you zip up ?
No!
Mum
Yes?
Can I  can I bring one for Robert for when he comes out?
Erm
Can't I just bring one for him then?
No, well  
He'll have one, he'll have a turtle when he comes in.
Have to give you your mum's 
Yeah 
Now I need four pounds and so how am I gonna get four pounds  out of a ten pound note?
Simon!
Mum can I give one to Robert when he comes out of school?
Mum can I give one to Robert when he comes out of school ?
Well not really no cos you  Simon can take them now  
 
No can you just    
Oh don't put that whingeing tone on.
Okay.
Do you wanna play it one go?
And I'll be my two turtles and you be yours.
The rock and roll ones.
Yeah we have to be two rock and roll ones each.
Yeah, I'll be that one.
You can have him 
 
you can have him.
And  only a monkey.
I know.
And which two, which three ?
Right two 
No I want them two.
No, no,th it doesn't count, that one doesn't.
You want these three look.
Them two don't count do they?
No .
I know, I'll go from the  I know, let's start from the bottom.
One of those
No let's start  from the bottom.
No no, we'll just do the  right.
Er if you, you can have  do you want a go like that?
Right there  and you want that one  that one  that one, the one under that one,and you have  and I have those two  these two  and you  and I have these two  and this one.
Oh let me work this out.
Yeah.
Cos we can't do it.
Right.
We'd better start from the top.
Well I want them so I've got that one so I need that one now to go with it.
What?
How many have you had then?
Three.
How many altogether?
Er I dunno.
Mum, mum 
There's stacks of them in there.
I just want    trousers.
Ooh goodness I'm not  man's trousers.
Mum, do you know this one's trousers 
No it's just they look like jeans.
Oh right, oh he jus oh goodness  they're soft but they ca not, they're rough rough 
They're like jeans.
And the rest of him's shiny and looks smooth doesn't it?
Cos I thought of them as rough but 
I know , oh.
I wish we didn't have so many turtles so I can work it out better.
let me see where I am 
What?
I'm just trying to sort out some papers here.
They've got to go this morning.
Right.
Simon, you've got Slash haven't you?
Simon you've got Slash  Simon do you know, Simon, you've got Slash haven't you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
And I'm trying to    but I'm trying to but I, but a person Mr Alex  won't let him.
Is that you?
Are you Mr Alex ?
Simon!
Think we have to cut that bit off
No we won't.
Well cos it 
We need it.
it's my piece.
We need it.
It's my piece.
We need it Alex when we   dad won't let us
I think I might have  that piece .
piece cutting off here, I cut, do them out on the outsides first and then I'll go booooooooooo
Right lads we're going out in five minutes, I don't know if you need to go to the toilet Alex?
there.
Well you can do that you, well ten more, ten more minutes but do you need to go to the toilet before you go to school  Alex?
No.
You went yesterday, do you need to go?
Okay.
No no.
Simon, we have to see which one we want.
You haven't got all the turtles here.
I've got all the rock and roll ones and the ones that we got yesterday.
Well we got the rock and roll ones  first  well they have, them two have to go together in a certain place cos them are all the rock and roll ones and them are not.
They're in a certain place.
Do you think he looks like that ?
Yeah
like that.
Yeah because  
We found out last night that he, you know them things that you lift up?
Yeah.
Th them funny things?
Them?
No  them things that you lift up, the metal things 
Will you show 
with the round ends   
Will you, will you w will you show me?
Right, like this.
They look a bit like them wheels.
You hold them like that.
You hold them in the middle like that so you, it's strong.
Yeah.
Well it says on the back of the thing you take these off and use that, use them as that thing  his hands.
Okay  
No not we can't  we ca we can't do it, I tried it last night.
Can't do it now.
Did you play with my turtles last night?
Yeah.
I know, I'll have  my turtles now and you  your turtles.
Swap him for him?
Yeah?
Yeah.
No
No swap 
I said no.
the best out of all the rock and roll turtles isn't it?
No which one do you think out of yours  things?out of yours?
Him  or him, or him do you think?
I'll swap him if you want.
Yeah, yeah  no it's not!
Okay.
Just said no swaps but
I know.
if I can swap back  
Yeah that was alright I w I didn't tell you the truth when we said that, sorry!
You can't change.
I know 
You can't change back now 
I can.
You can't.
I'll do Pete's face.
I know where his leg is.
Where?
Upstairs.
In the  box?
We won't get it till next year.
We've just got Fantasia haven't we?
We've just we've just got the rel release of Fantasia on video over here.So  Ah.
I've se Yeah, I've seen lo loads of things about looking into it and I, there was definitely  more than one shots   you know and er  yeah, absolutely.
Anyway look I'd better go.
Right  Right I'll er, I'll get this er, I'm just busy with, with school at the moment but I'll, I'll get the er whatsit off to you, the er  tt erm Beatles Monthly which I've got waiting here and I'll .
Nice to talk to you Don  say hi to Debbie for us.
Okay thanks very much indeed  okay, bye .
Oh!
. Quick.
Are you prepared?
round the head with this.
No we went in and erm  it was about er three or four minutes before we actually started and he just gave us this paper and he put sets of questions to the different types of differentiation
Yeah
and to each set they'd be any thing up to ten sub set questions, so er he says do what you can in er the hour, well it's not an hour, but it's fifty minutes 
not really no once you get every body in and you get started 
yeah and, and you look at the clock at five too, five too and that's it 
and you think you might of done and you're still stopping 
so we set off going and I thought well the first ones were, didn't ask for a proof of doing it, just asked to do it
to do it, yeah
so I started working through them, but without referring back to the notes that you know what some of them
yeah, yeah 
differentiated to
mm, mm
so you really have to remember what some of them change into
yeah yeah, like some of them 
you can, you 
like it ain't it?
you can work out the mathematical ones
mm
but the trigonometry ones you have to know what they turn into  I got some things, a couple of them I was  getting stuck on what I supposed to put and then I actually go too far on some 'em, I, I
make them again you know
yeah, yeah
any way he's coming round
you've not much proof you can prove them
yeah
huh, summat like that
well you can get so far, but then I work the brackets out and you don't always have to work the brackets out
mm
you leave them as a full
themselves, yeah
erm set of numbers, erm any way he was coming round and I just kept saying well I'm stuck a minute, he says why, I says it doesn't look right  he says well why doesn't it look right?, he said well why doesn't it look right?,
I said look if I say it doesn't look right that's all I know, it just doesn't look right
you daren't say that you don't understand any thing he says you've got to explain 
no I'd done it 
why you don't under 
yeah 
and you don't always know
but I'd done it you see
mm
but the answer didn't look right
look right, yeah
to the question
so you couldn't  
well he's going through it and he said well it looks alright to me and I say well it doesn't look as if it's connected, any way I won, I could see why then it didn't look connected
mm
erm, with because it was, erm  as the denominator and not an numerator one it was, it was one over 
but it was alright?
so it was right
any way subsequent to that he gave us one which  it was awkward working it out and then he gave us one over the same
yeah
I said I'm not working all that out again 
no just
I just
go over and do it all again do ya 
and then do a different rule
yeah, yeah
so he said yeah but there's another way you do it, I said well what's the point in doing it again, I've just done it one, he said well yes there's two ways of doing it 
he wants to see you doing it the other way as well 
no he didn't no 
no oh
any way I got to the last one and it was  two combinations combined together, so you've got two separate combinations to do and then you're to put those two together in with a different rule
do you know how I feel now, I said if she ain't saying yeah I'm gonna
what you told me
yeah
you know what he said the first time we went into sociology  I mean  I feel a bit like you must of felt then
well I came out and I actually just finished them
mm
I just did the last one, the next, the, the, the next to the last one erm, I said er, I can't remember what the differentiation of it is, he said you wouldn't you haven't done it, I said no we'd started to
yeah
I said I know it's an inverse, well he said if you know it's an inverse you're half way there
yeah
so he said well what's an inverse and an inverse?,
I said it's back to the original 
back to what it is then, yeah
he said that's all you need to know  so he actually showed me how to work it back
yeah
but I said look it's Wednesday lunch time, I haven't woke up yet, I don't wake up to Friday night
you know I'm still struggling  and we were having a laugh, but the others who had him last term, said he was brilliant, because he actually combines work individually
individually, yeah
rather than works just going through it and hoping you all keep up
mm
and we were saying last year we could of done with having him for a bit
so er how's Jean coping with this alright?
she was getting through them, they were just slower
mm, mm
but she was getting there, her and Bren were er conferring you see  I'd sort of gone through what I'd done and every now and again she'd say well I've done this and I'd say well it's right.
Are her and Bren still in the, more or less the same boat, they kind of just, mustering through as it were?
I think Jean's got more about her than Bren 
than Bren 
yes
sort of, but neither of them are taking it on are they next year?
yeah, well Bren is
yeah, I don't think, is Jean, I got the impression like she wasn't, I don't know
I think originally
she'd done Russian studies and management or something
originally she was going to do it, but there's a new one come in and she's decided to go on this management, managements and it's the new one 
that's right yeah 
it doesn't start till next year does it?
mm, till the, the trial
yeah
it's a lot ain't they?
somebody else I know er 
 
somebody else's applied for it as well 
Dan's going for it he thinks 
yeah 
he, he isn't, he's a bit, up in the air I think at the moment, he doesn't know what he wants to do I don't think
I mean I keep on saying if I found I couldn't do the maths I'd ditched
I wouldn't go on
but if, if if you could, the first year 
but I think , I think if I did flunk out on the maths side
mm
I would look probably for another course
he did strike me like how I'd feel about this because it's
I mean it's, yes it's difficult, but yes I've got to do it and if I don't do it this, you'll have to do it
again, so I thought well he took to me I'm the one that's going to get me through, not them
I mean fortunately doing the maths 
it's the sort of thing you notice when you complain you might as well do 
yeah doing, doing the maths you see I don't have to do another science next year
that's right, yeah
cos it's already there
yeah
I don't know what, do you have any thing that you have to put in place if you don't do
I know what you mean, you mean if you take maths under principle you're gonna have subsidized principle maths
well you, you've only got to get to subsid science
mm, mm that gives you subsid science
yeah, so why would you have to do another one next year?
you won't have to do another science next year will you?
you've got to do another subsid
maybe so, I don't know, I thought you only needed two subsids, unless a subsid in summat you take to
doesn't count, but that that would never be what, what 
you see I've got two subsids now literally the transfer 
I don't really  now 
and the subsid, sociology 
yes 
I work, er unless they say next year just 
you transfer most
wasn't it?
well yes cos 
to transfer you
the only thing I wondered is if next year that you've got to do a subsidiary, and if you've not got a science you must do science
not against another subsid I must admit
no 
so specializing in that, you know, rather
 
well the thing is in the end for all the subsidiaries that you pass it counts on the
mm
final award 
I mean I, this year if I get me physics and me, and me
I wouldn't mind doing another one next year, but my choice, whatever I fancy at that time
mm
you know, like the biology I
you know the biology's gonna be hard, I can tell that the maths gonna be hard, but I think I've got more of an interest in biology than physics, I mean I, I don't know if Jean's done any
any biology
I don't know
you know I mean I've looked through the parasitology books I've got about two of 'em it's all cestodes and lima luminaries and  and worse the jargon in biology 
it's, in biology what got me, when I did it, it's, it's, yeah 
the Latin names and most of the time 
the dictionary words that you have to remember
mm, I mean I'm okay cos I've done my
 
yeah 
although I haven't done particulary parasitology I know some of 'em, I've done bits of 'em, but like if you've never done biology it must be the same feeling again
mm
that you had in sociology that I 
yeah 
still get in the physics
yeah
you know you just still bewildered because you don't understand, I mean like I go to this night class and apparently I, I learn from it, but in actual fact I don't, I come out I get eight out of ten, nine out of ten, or ten out of ten and I haven't got a clue what it's about
no
and that, that to me is just a waste of time, no I mean I'm wasting their time and mine so 
yeah 
I'll have to get down to it 
I don't  I don't know that I'd fancy doing, I mean I did like biology, but I don't think I'd specifically want to do the biology at the level that they're doing it up there, cos it's too much of a jump from what I've ever done before
yes I think any thing at that level must be, you know, when you think well sociology yeah, nice, interesting, sociology at university level
no it isn't though because it's 
again 
a tendency to be based on what you can read and what you understand of today's social problems, I mean every thing we've had so far apart from the industrial revolution and the history behind it
mm
is being about today sociological problems 
yes yeah
I mean like we've had er woman 
not too bad 
woman and children of the third world, well that's of today's problem, what about they show you how it was created, it's a problem of today
yeah, yeah, yeah
we had this day state ethnicity and racism, it was all about gypsies
state  technicity?
state, it's three separate groups, state ethnicity and nationalism 
oh right yeah
and they did it on gypsies
did you, oh they, there
and gypsies probably
I don't know
mm
that didn't crop up, what was 
they  
cropping up was erm  that they've got a very definite code of what is internal to them and what is external to them, it starts off what belongs in the camp and what belongs out of the camp
mm
and outsiders you are not gypsies don't belong in the camp
so the feeling of the gypsies to what to us is probably equally antagonistic as most people's attitude to gypsies 
then it's what belongs in the trailer as to what belongs out
I felt sorry for the gypsies you know in Cross Street
not Cross Street, they were on
the festivals car park, you know the whole thing and I mean then he kicked them off didn't he, so they moved up to Cross Street so in a way it's their own fault, they could of let them stay there, I mean every body wants to be settled somewhere like
Christmas as well don't they I suppose
mm
I felt sorry for 'em
but, they, the way  the way they were, they got the, actually the  the woman, she's a girl, she's a doctor of sociology she's, she's barely out of her twenties she's not 
who?
Sharon 
mm
absolutely brilliant lecturer
 
she really was , she, she's on the  antipology's staff
seems to me though at that age you've got freshness and initiative
yeah
you know what I mean they haven't gone stagnate 
yeah 
and stale and bored with the job 
she 
still got the real interest there
gave a lecture and all she came in with was some notes written out on some full scape paper and some papers for the over head projector
mm
but she just  bowled over
I think enthusiasm does go over 
and 
doesn't it?
the hour had gone and we could of stayed probably another half an hour without realizing that the hour had come 
yeah 
and gone  and then we went to the tutorial and I'm afraid Harry just, phew, it's just like wind up session, you know you feel as if you want to cut, to get it going
mm
but erm  he was on about certain aspects that he picked up from her, but having been in gypsy caravans round here, as when they were on Line Brook you see we were always at Line Brook for one reason or another
mm
and they do have different standards, but I say they are different classes of the gy 
yeah, yeah 
the true gypsies are clean, it's the, what we call the tinkers, just the travellers that pop on a site and move on
yeah yeah 
do a quick kill on the tarmac and see what goes on in the town and then they move on
redefine rubbish and move on yeah 
but there used to be a caravan down here, I'm not joking the value of stuff that was in it, was unbelievable and it was so clean and every thing had a place and it was all mirrored inside, cos he liked the mirrors and, or glass work, oh it was beautiful
yeah
stuck in the middle of that dumpy site
mm
but the site was  they did their own down fall with the first ones that went on it, cos they ripped out all the water pipes and the toilets and the, they, they literally decimated the site so the Council said oh they're not doing it again
any more, yeah me sister was saying that this, cos she lives opposite 
the thousand of pounds 
er
yeah
so of course they're against it 
they threw it all in the brook
mm
so they refused to do it up, well the result was over the years the pot holes down to the sites got bigger and they're so far off the road from
mm
Brook Lane, but  well what you couldn't see you didn't know about, we used to take the cars down there it was nightmare and when you got down there, there was always the dogs roaming around and
mm
but there was some nice people
yeah
 
but there was some rough ones 
yeah, I thought it's worth
but I mean when you start looking at what the topics are in sociology, there's nothing really 
tha that you haven't got some
 
if you've got a ma if you've got a mature mind 
and another thing, yeah
I would think for some of the younger ones who haven't seen or read a lot in the papers of where, what's going on 
we said that last year to our Neville and found it very boring 
it might be very difficult and it could be
mm, mm 
boring , but when you've got that experience of, you've seen these things occur
well when they start talking about how hard done two women are
yeah
and how easy men have it, you know what I mean, a little bit of you saying oh yeah, yeah, yeah that happened to me I know it could 
well I mean we had one girl didn't know what she was going about, but, you know, women don't have all the work to do in the house and her dad helps at weekends and I said well who made the decision in the first place to do what
after the weekend 
well we help with the dinner, but I said who was it that decided what you're having and got the ingredients together and had decided
and the fact you're going to help her with the dinner, huh
and she kept on about, but we help, I said but who do you help?
she can't identify though with a woman that's kind of been mild and had kids
and, er well I did say er are you married?, no, will you be having any children?, definitely not, I said well unless you're prepared to  take on the responsibility
mm
of a home and a family that a woman has with children, you've got no right to criticise
no, no
oh we had quite a heated argument about it 
you can only learn I think from your, from your experience and yet it's something every body has to go through 
personal experience, yeah 
isn't it that? that 
yeah 
breaking away and realizing just how, you know how mucky a house is 
so it is so easy when you're only helping on a side line because you're not doing any of the thought processing 
you probably think you put a lot into, yeah, it's the remind as well I think like the constant remind of you were the one that takes responsibility for birthdays and for Christmas presents
yeah
and for writing letters and
yeah
you know maybe helping neighbours and 
yeah 
like things I suppose men don't think of
I sat there and
not because they can't
yeah
but because they've never been taught, you know taught to do that sort of thing 
I sat there last night I actually I'm on the way to the post office cos I got the erm form back for claiming for Christmas holidays
mm
and they're asking erm for a copy of the grant
again  
again which they've had haven't they?, for how many weeks in the year do you actually attend cos I said that you don't get grant for the holidays and it stipulates the term
you don't get it for Easter
you don't get it 
you get so much for Easter, don't you, but none for the summer, they give you twenty odd quid for Easter and twenty odd quid for Christmas
well with the dependents allowance you get so much with it 
yeah , yeah
but apparently you see the terms are split up and you actually don't get any thing when you're not in on 
mm 
the terms, well the grant form shows what the terms are
mm
so I said well it cost us just so many weeks though, I've put it in again, I've, I'm sending it back today in the hope that they will come up with a decision in the next week, cos usually once they've got the information they'll write back say within ten days yes or no
mm
but erm
I'm thinking about this thing, new what sort of representative sample, where they get the whole thing random, I think they just go and knock at doors, take out every so many names off the list
must be
of so many men and so many women, of today 
er I think 
er a class difference
I think she's got a quota
mm, mm
 

so many of each type or 
yeah 
each age, age group or whatever 
give a fair representation
yeah
yeah
mm
oh well this P C F A
er Trish 
maybe us 
er the, the woman who I meet up at you know who works in the coffee shop she was there 
oh yeah she was there
she's
oh they've got some stuff there
blimey she said meeting you here, well she sat chatting to Emma  all night
I haven't seen her for ages 
they were laughing and giggling up the corner  and er, I mean I did go just to let them know that although I did say I wouldn't come to every meeting I was quite prepared to still do 
mm, mm 
what I could
did Joe come with you
oh he would
because he didn't wanna stay in or
he wants, cos he wants to go every where I go
to see what you're doing, what you're up to 
to see what's going on 
yeah
and I said well your be bored, no I won't, and about half past eight, which I thought well we should be finishing by now, he said well aren't we going?
I said well we will be going and it finally finished at nine o'clock, erm, the  the topics under discussion are all really relevant 
mm, mm
but they sort of get carried away slightly 
yeah you all follow
and chit chat gets going some where else
yeah and then you go in with that conversation instead of the one you should of
yeah
yeah
but er, they've got to get a new mini bus apparently, there in two years, which we new and er  because like every thing else, it's funded by the school not the authorities
mm, mm
but 
well have they got to get rid of staff or not?, cos the school that Gary's at now they had like an emergency meeting on Monday
mm
it was supposed to be a normal meeting but he changed it to talk about the cuts you know the
on saving education, he said that I supposed to get the six teachers, he said I'm gonna get rid of five he said and if I possible can I'm going to make it four, that gotta remember those of you who are on protected salaries erm you again the pay and a half other members of staff and he said he wanted voluntary redundancies and early retirements where possible, you know, and also he hadn't supposed to tell for a month so this will come out later in the year
and he says I'm telling you know he says because the next twenty eight days, it's an extra twenty eight days to go and have a look for another job
yeah 
if you want to, but Gary's pretty sure that he won't be one of 'em
he hopes but then 
well that's the problem
if nobody 
thing is though if it did happen
yeah
at least were, were covered
yeah
you know, but I mean at the moment I keep, he's coming home some nights and, you know it like, he'll come home and say I had a really good morning the kids were great, but as for the afternoon, and like he said when you're teaching you're only as good as your last lesson, you know
yeah
so I thought he, he's changing things he's saying well I don't think this is suitable and I don't think my way of tackling this is suitable because he's used to dealing with different kids, although they're a similar age, they're not very motivated or mighty but they're more motivated than these kids, but he says like he'll turned back towards the black board and he'll be writing and they're shouting abuse at him, F ing and blinding and he says it makes me so angry because I don't know the voices well enough to know who's saying it
mm
you know, it is just so frustrating, you know and er some of these kids he said and the language they use, one girl came in, she hadn't been in for three or four days, he hadn't met her and he said hello you must be such and such er
fuck you  you know, I mean, he'd never even met the girl before, he said it's very you know distressful and demoralizing
mm
but he seems to be mustering through any way
no telling cos 
cos he's got to really more than you can 
tell him to watch To Sir With Love
oh dear 
and then 
oh it, er, yeah
 
because he had exactly the same problems when he moved in
yeah
and he's attitude was in the end well if you don't want the education as it comes, we'll teach you the education that you want and the first thing was 
well  
was to respect each other and that 
yeah 
was my essay, I wrote in to the education was that, the top and bottom of personal discipline
mm, mm
was the self respect for you and a respect for others
mm 
and the discipline is only there out of respect
hanging out the window shouting abuse at one another coming up the corridors 
yeah, yeah 
don't  
but the thing is I was reading this erm, I was reading another book on this erm
you haven't read another book Sandra, that's two books, goodness
I've not got through them all, I was just reading selective pieces
bits, yeah
the trouble with this is it's an American book so it's a bit, I call it biased, erm on erm the betrayal of children on, on the way that they're not in childhood for very long and it blames literacy, that the more the literate the child becomes
mm
the earlier the literacy developed
will become a 
the sooner they become independent
mm
and this idea of childhood being up until sixteen, eighteen years of age, was only 
shows at nine now aren't they 
yeah 
you know shows at 
would develop only after the sixteen century
mm, mm, yes, yeah
in the middle ages
yeah
children were grown up when they were eight and nine because they were working 
that's right, cos of the more responsible than they are now
it's only changed with the, the revolutions that said that
mm
children were not allowed to be employed for different lengths of times and social change
mm
change the way that we thought children ought to be and educa 
it is education isn't it, they arrange them in a class 
yes and it's the education that is made children literate early on in life
mm
and it's the literacy that just de made them into child adults
like the it's, it's industrialization it's education
mm
it's capitalism
one, one of the 
got to be 
one of the criticisms that has come out on this one book was that  because the, these child adults are skilled and put into education, they maybe still illiterate, but they are street wise, they are literate of the street 
oh right I think, I think I was gonna say not non 
and, yeah 
literate, but less literate
yeah
kids are, aren't they?
but they don't want education 
that's what I think any way mm
because education changes their social standing, takes them off the street  and then they're not at the level that they were, young adults, they're children again
mm
and they don't want it
mm
but when they actually get into which country, I mean, this, one of these books as I say it was only published in nineteen eighty eight and statistics in it are as recent
mm, mm
as it was published, she does make allowances, she says some of the statistics I upgraded at the publication of the book
yeah yeah 
so there were nineteen eighty eight's statistics, some were the year before
mm, I was gonna say the stuff that
gave us last year it's was nineteen eight, eight, eighty nine
yeah, but when
only about two years behind the
when, when you looked at which country had problems with education with children 
Britain, America yeah
well we were considered to be fortunate that we didn't, we only had a small percentage that we had a problem with 
yeah 
but America's rising child population who were becoming street wise and illiterate 
mm, mm 
and out of education, but countries like Italy were all ready were a bit like South America
mm
they had street children  and they have the leather sweat shops, most of the children from eight, nine
mm
work in he leather shops making all these cheap leather bags and purses 
yeah 
and belts that you've got on the market
mm
and they're earning approximately twenty five pound a week
mm
and they're saying well why go to school, because if I go I give up that income, half goes to mum
mm
who they only see when they care to go home
yeah
and the rest of it is spent on erm  arcade machines
yeah, yeah
and fast food
plus what will they get out the educational system any way  
well apparently the education system in Italy is so  poor
mm
it's been destroyed, the buildings that they use have got no equipment, they've 
mm 
got no desk and chairs they're actually using 
so they're probably better off in the sweat shop any way 
yeah
so why bother
they're actually using old ware houses in places
mm
and old industrial buildings that they've just taken over and when there's a crisis in the housing, the state takes over the schools and uses them as refugee centres
mm
so, I mean, one school turned out to be an old factory and it was of six floors and it had one of these like industrial lifts, you know, the open caged lifts
yeah
so the staff use that and the children had to go up six flights of stairs 
yes, yeah 
and it was in a back ally way and
mm
the people who were going round these different countries 
that, that'll be here sooner 
if we follow on the same way 
governments the same yeah
erm, I think probably because our education system  developed more so with the industrial change
mm 
and we were geared more to  progress in the education system where the industrial change in the other countries didn't happen at the same time and that they needed now a younger ag a younger age group to keep the, the industrial system going
mm, mm
that their education system's failing
mm
but, I mean ours is heading the same way with this rebellious  education 
all the things that's like and ours , I say with ours they're cutting back and cutting back all the time until I mean it's under funded now, it's under staffed already, thirty seven, thirty eight in the class, so what do they do now, they want to save seven million on education
I must admit that, that 
and more teachers going that's an even bigger crisis 
yeah 
and yet they've got to implement 
yeah 
the national curriculum to all these stats tests 
yeah,do 
do you know I mean and
there was a paragraph erm 
there's not  in a day 
a paragraph at the end of one of the chapters and, I can't remember the exact words but in, what it meant was that for the parents who do restrain the children from what they watch
mm
where they go, and that the education they receive, they are part and parcel of it
mm
Chris said one of the biggest failings was that parents did not  take part in the education of the children, this is where it fell down, that, once the education was seen as a government thing that
take control of the best as the parent, that's not  
they'd taken control from the parent, and the parents quite readily gave that control to the state, they no longer had parental control
mm
so when they wanted to, to, to have a discipline in the home, they couldn't have it, because they didn't take part in the education and then 
yeah 
time that the education was put back to the parents to enforce both
mm
part of their early literacy 
but if you do try to
the education you'll conflicting whatever they're teaching up there aren't you?, and then ya
the end cha , the end of the chapter said that if parents were to re-take on the role of educating and disciplining children within the home
mm
to what they watched, the times that they were in
yeah
and that they took more erm  more emphasis on the way their lives developed
mm
they might seen from the child's point of view as interfering parents, but in the long term
this is what's er all about power and power though 
yeah 
isn't it
yeah
and the government
yeah
give you the impression that you've got a parents child, you've got a parents right
but they've said that in the end 
it doesn't mean a thing 
that those children would be the ones that survive
mm
the social revolution from education back to illiteracy
mm  now 
cos they said it was all to do with social status
yes, well you know actually you say that because like here I, I do, I mean I, I got all these
books for Alex and I want to help him and I want him to have an advantage, but I don't want it to cause problems at school
mm
because he can read the first two books, now how they'll do it with him, he'll have to just look at the pictures and he'll go back to square one, and I've had him actually writing his words, doing letter formation, A, B, C, D
yeah, but some books, in the books, in the book shop for sale doing that
I'll have a look, but I've had him doing actual words, like first words er, you know erm, Ben and large and in and out and just the, the easy words and Luke and his own name, so he is already got the idea that when you write a letter you can't just write any letter, you've got to make letters say something either as erm, as an alphabet or in the form of words, so of course she says to, would you all like to write me a sentence, well he's already passed that stage, he thinks himself well I can't write a sentence, what he knows as a sentence consists of words that make sense, so they're all sitting there going a N, N, N, Q, R, S, N, T, T, and they're saying a sentence like I went to the shops with my nanny, well Alex has already passed that stage, he knows that that isn't sensible, so he must of turned to her and he said, I can't write like that, my mummy will shout at me
yeah
you know she told me about it, she says I think I must mention it and I said okay I won't do it any more and she said oh please do it, we need you to do it she said especially the letter formation, she says what just try and encourage him to write any old letters, just to make sure that he can form them without copying them
yeah
you with me?, cos I'm having him going over my words, but I felt really guilty about that, because I, the thought that he was frightened of me shouting at him and yet I think it's to do with passing over of all authority, I've been teaching him, I'm the one that does the words, not her
yeah
now he's got to transfer that authority, I don't think it's any more or less than that 
no 
you know what I mean, but the fact that I have been helping him has already conflicted and he hasn't been in school a week, you know, and then eventually when they get those books out and he'll say oh I know that one, that says Luke
mm 
then again think what, what the hell is she gonna do with him and yet I keep saying to myself I shouldn't do it and then another bit of me saying why shouldn't I do it, why shouldn't I have to
because every bit of encouragement you 
mm 
give him now
the younger I think, yeah
it's got to pay off, because he won't be struggling at the end of this year to be trying to read and write, he will of achieved that
mm
and when the learning process of new material comes along, he's not still struggling on learning how to read and write
mm
because you see the one's who still can't read properly have 
you see when they get to eleven
yeah
and they can't remember
yeah
they don't seem clever boys
yeah, they have difficulty then picking up new material
mm
because they can only accept what's given verbally, they can't read for themselves  oh I don't know 
no stopping him 
but  I mean I, like I said, I volunteered to go and help with this, I ain't heard back from him yet 
no 
but that was the whole purpose to sort of volunteering on that, because I know that
mm, would like, I think
Chesterton at high school up at the swimming baths he's classed, it's nearly up to temperature
oh cheers
because the one it's so, don't go
no, but, I mean our can read and he could read when he left the first class, he did really well
mm
he's perception of early words 
mm
I mean he grasped what the word, he grasped the way she taught him and he soon learnt to read and he could retain those words
mm
I don't say he retains as much now
yeah
but reading
I mean the thing is their own
he, with
last night somebody had, had erm birthday that, sort of his
to be, group, she's, her daughter is forty odd, but she still helps out down at the school
yes
and er, they sent her er bouquet and a card for her birthday, she was seventy, and she wrote a letter back and she passed it around for every body to read, and  there was, in her writing, which was very clear
yes
and in it was the word appreciation, now, he'd probably seen the word before, but he didn't know the word
mm
but he worked through and he managed to get out that it said appreciation
yeah, yeah
now, now I know if me sister's lad had got that
he would have to 
he would have , he wouldn't be able to do it
yeah, yeah
and he would be only able to pick out a lot of the basic words, he could probably pick out the beginning of appreciation
mm, yes
but then he'd probably guess the rest of it where 
yes 
as John stopped guessing the rest of it, he now works out what it says
yeah, yeah
so I'm, I mean they do say that his reading ability he's, he's 
yeah 
up to standard
yeah
he's 
see he was not as pretty good as the other, I wouldn't like to say whether he could really turn up the application 
his writing yeah
or something
his writing's like mine
yeah 
and I bear no  responsibility for it 
responsibility 
but I did go into her and I said look, he's got my sympathy
got my writing  
he is just like me he's brain is going too fast for the pencil
yeah 
and he has to write it down, so you have to get it
well if he gets it right
however it comes
yeah
and because he's going so fast
mm
he's writing gets faster than he can do it neat
yeah
so he j , now he does make an effort in some of his books and, I mean they say write small, I mean on one page if he wrote any smaller I need a ma 
yeah, yes
I need it under a microscope, it's so, and I said John you can't write that small, but she said write small and I said but, that is ridiculous
small, yeah, it, yeah
and 
see that's what they said, oh you're writing too big
yeah
keep it small so before you know, you know, it's usually like you know 
and they don't actually, yeah 
you need a microscope don't you to see it 
they're not actually printing, as soon as they can form the words, they join them
well I was, I was get , I was just about to mention that
I didn't like that 
you don't think it's right
no
I don't think it's right, my niece Sue doesn't think it's right, they're doing it in school, it's part of the national curriculum, as soon as they can form the letters now, they join them, I said I go to King university and I don't join up my letters
no
and you know it isn't stopping me 
why, why is the necessity though to accept joined writing
it's back again to the old fashioned set, I mean I think nothing looks so untidy as to joined writing 
Howard   he, he joins them in so many varied ways
mm, well, yeah
it's not uniformed for the whole sentence
mm
the same letters joined together
once you get a bad habit and it slows your writing down as well 
yeah 
I've noticed how Simon's like that
if he was to print
very disjointed
and then just joined those that were easy to join together and building it up that way, but he's doing curls on the bottom of G's and
right and X like that?
yeah, and 
I think it's ludicrous, it's old fashion isn't it?, he doesn't even real, what we used to call real writing 
no it isn't even proper joined up writing 
 
it's fancy isn't it?
yeah 
it's like the, cos I keep saying if you must do those F's you do it at school I said, but do not do them for me, I said if you do I do not want to see them, but again you've got a conflict there between home and school
well I think, I think his writing's 
and it must reflect on children 
got to be standardized, that it's legible, to teach them all to write as an individual allows them this
that isn't, well that isn't given 'em individuality is it?
well in the sense that they can all adopt their own way of joining words together
if he lets 'em do that, but they're not are they?, you know, you've got to do your F like that, only
like you say write letters and then, you know, join 'em, or you know join 'em as you write them 
but he's , he's aren't jo , our John's aren't uniform
mm
he's squiggle 
one thing about Simon's I mean he's 
his join up in so many varied ways
mm
like a G they will join up in exactly the same way next time he does it, even to the same letter 
I'm with you yeah, see Sam's got some learning, when he comes to spellings to me, again I would, I would print  yeah, he only scrawled that down last night, he says I've got some spellings on sports mum, I said do you know any of 'em?, he said no, I said when's you test?, he says Friday, well I gotta book on all sports and then I read it because sports and you think hockey's one of them, oh yeah, racket, which is spelt wrong I've had to, I think it's got a U in, but again I mean sometimes, I mean I'm a good speller, I don't know about you, but I look at them sometimes and I have to go and get the dictionary have to check em 
mm 
you can see how he spelt croquet
mm
I think it is C R O U Q U E T.
it is, mm
but it's like you see, he gives them spellings and he puts perhaps three or four wrong in twenty and they're supposed to come home and check 'em, meanwhile he leaves them on the board for a whole week, which I think I've told you before 
yeah 
now when I don't get them till Wednesday night or Thursday night, I've got no chance of helping him really
no
actually I think he'll be alright with most of 'em, the problem he'll have is wi with racket and croquet, the, the others I think he'll be okay on it 
if he let's join in the K, you, your lad had the same problem as I with John.
mm, mm.
If you're going to teach joined up writing, there is a way of writing a K with a little loop that you can join up 
that's right, yeah, yeah 
but they are ending up draw, actually doing literally a capital K and then just joining it up, which is not 
and then joining it, well yeah yeah
joined writing
mm
they're effectively having to re-write the word 
yes 
instead of it flowing
mm
if, I said, I said to John 
you see them with A's, they tend to do the A and then they join it at the top
yeah
I mean, and that's how Mr  does it
Mr  said, it's not 
well can't we parents do something about this?,
I mean were 
well this 
supposed to have parent power aren't we?
well we had a parents' meeting on Monday night, but I didn't realize there was one
the trouble is though when you have these meetings you go and people say well I don't agree with this and I don't agree with that and somebody says well this isn't the matter for the P T A this is a matter for the governors and then when you try and, like Gary I'll go and approach with the governors, surely this isn't a matter for the governors, this really ought to be, you know, the,
the P, of the P T A
yeah 
or they 
but I mean I can see that for he's got, he's doing exactly the same, literally a capital K in the middle of joined writing
mm, yeah
if you're going to join a K  you, you, you should, I mean joined writing to me should be a soften version
mm
it should be a flowing version and to do a capital K like that is not exactly join
mm
I don't think I even join up some, I mean there's lots of words I do 
I don't think you can join up every letter cos when I've 
you can't 
tried to do joined writing, apparently we are supposed to do that as teachers, actually said gotta put their primary on primary education, it says sit down and write a poem in joined up writing and look at your own writing and before you try to teach it to children make sure that you know
yeah
what your look, same with your letter forage, I think mostly we were taught letter formation, which we haven't been for a few years now 
mm 
all of a sudden were going back on, on to it, aren't they?, so when I was my eldest he was, he was 
I mean I 
writing properly and
but somebody like our John who's 
take my hand 
been doing joined writing since he was nine
mm
and it's, it's better than it was, but it still doesn't have 
but he's two years older than our Simon isn't he, our Simon's only nine now
he doesn't have
to it
mm, you saying that at least the future, you doing it, do it uniform
yeah, if you, follow 
yeah 
the same rules, don't just say to them well, I know they must give them they give 
Sandra you got time to sit, sit and do it with him, like I tried to do with Simon or 
he won't do it he won't work at home
that's right 
he said at the end of the day I've had enough 
had enough, yeah 
and I, I mean that's another objection  he's going to go 
why do you send him to school and then have to do school's work?
no, no, I'd 
 
rather him
give them the responsibility
I'd rather him come home with half an hours work
we've had this up there yeah 
because if he comes in from school he knows he's got half an hours work 
something productive from school yeah, yeah
you at least can keep up with what he's doing because you can see 
that's right, yeah 
what he's doing
mm
otherwise you've only got two open days when you 
mm 
can go and, alright you can go in and tell him right 
the more you tell them, the more they left you know, even when you say to them what did you do at school?, then what did you do?, oh nothing much it was  
but if he comes in with some work, you can keep on the check of the standard that they're up to 
mm
without having to keep going up to school, cos if you say to them oh well I'm coming to see, oh what you coming for?
well that's what education's all about isn't it?, completely blocking the parents out 
plus at the end of the day when he comes in, you've at least got the chance to say right, you've got your homework to do, switch every thing off,sw put all these machines away and 
mm 
do your homework
mm
but now they haven't got any thing to do because their curriculum says 
even when you go in though too, I mean you say, well it's, it's voluntary homework 
it's voluntary , if they say to them 
can't you go and say I volunteer that my son has  homework 
no
every night 
if, if, if he says I've done it in class and I don't want to finish it off at home, that's fair enough, but what's gonna happen when he gets to secondary level and he's got this idea that if he doesn't finish it in class, that's it, he doesn't do it, he won't finish learning the topic
mm, well we've been told this with Simon, you know needs to get to standard with them, with maths in particularly, before he goes up to secondary level  you know because
yeah
secondary builds on what you've learnt in primary it's like maths
only, int it?
mm
it builds on what you've learnt before
but I honestly
mm
do not feel that to say at eight, nine years of age, you see the little one's bring reading books home
mm
because they've got to keep that reading going
I know Simon never brings reading 
yeah 
books, I have to go in and say
yeah
can he have a reading book, well he's on level thirteen, he's doing well, but 
well, I always do it through the infants, they bring home reading books
yeah
and then it stops, they can bring a book home, but 
but it's choice
it's choice again, they read in class
mm
and they keep their reading books from the li their library  going at the pace they want to go at
yeah
and they don't have to bring them home, well John's got books at home, but it's like every thing else, he's too busy with the games machines and the television to be bothered to get a book out
why don't you borrow theirs?,
I've got, I've said that an all, all along they're actually good, should let your John have a look at these, some parts of it are boring, or some parts are really nice like the electric grade and, you know the fireworks 
oh yeah 
over there the show case and every thing 
yeah he might like that 
you know you can always fast forward it till it gets it right, but you've got all the characters coming round you know in all these cars and all 
yeah 
lite up and every thing
yeah
and there's bits of sea world on it  I'm just trying to think, erm and little bits of M G M Studios, and stuff like that  well erm 
I mean we went, we were last night, so, I mean he actually videoed er Battlestar Galaticca
yeah you said yesterday 
so what had , so what had we got on this morning
Battlestar Galaticca
but briar to that we've got this game show, you know, a bit like er Blind Date and I mean I can't stand them any way, and I'm thinking I haven't got the patience in the morning when I've got dinners to put up and I've got them to get going
yeah
to spend every minute of that hour arguing
well, yeah, yeah
but I, I'd never get them done, and I mean I'd fed Matthew and I shouted down and I said look you'll have to come and get him dressed cos I've got dinners to put up yet
yeah
and it took me as long to put the dinners up and clean the shoes and I thought well he's swimming, so I got his togs and put 'em in his bag and 
mm 
it wasn't until we got to school, he says, guess what I've forgotten?,
I says what's that?, me swimming stuff, well I said that's your fault, I said you 
I think there is a point at which you do have to 
yeah 
respond to it, I tend to do things like that
 
I said I'm sorry , but you've had all 
And also because  there's usually a waiting list to get on.
Oh God!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Sure there is.
But er, the woman who used to run it er, I mean, I don't know whether she's still there, Doreen .
She used to still be there.
And then er, there was another woman  occasionally.
Erm  but I think she's stopped, I don't know whether Doreen still does it or whether retired from it.
Oh!
Mm.
But er  I mean, these went to her.
They didn't go to playgroup sessions, but they just went the mums and toddler session.
Oh!
Oh I see!
See the mums and toddlers 
It's different sessions.
you stayed with them.
Oh!
I see.
Mums and toddlers you stayed  and you supervise your own child.
Oh no!
I wasn't thinking about that, I was thinking about the playgroup downstairs.
Well , there is playgroup where you leave them.
I know, cos I used to take, er take Freddie up there er, when he used to he does
Ah!
Oh!
swimming now.
It's there you are you just put your finger in there a 
But 
Yeah.
couple of times.
he used to go that 
Yeah.
play, when his mum had this  thing in the
Yeah.
and then the rest er, you know, but  most of it's .
Cor!
This is .
Oh!
She says she was supposed to be bring the money.
She says, she says it's, she gets one thing and  and
Yeah.
And they keep saying, why?
She says well you'll .
They get it, you know.
Takes on it all she does 
Yeah.
really.
I mean, there's, he's only .
Yeah.
You know, just talking to him now  he's obviously getting back at her.
And they always said, we always say this  should get he all?
He's gonna get nothing!
Yeah.
And er
.
Do you wanna get out?
Can you fasten that?
I don't know.
And we've got new
He did then.
About catalogue  thing.
We haven't heard yet.
Oh haven't you?
No.
Cos we presume he's still got to come.
Oh!
Cos they said, you know, sort of Christmas time.
Mm.
And his mum rang up  er, and he hadn't been, but he hadn't come as yet so er  What you doing?
Er
Oh!
John!
She's er
Nan,cartoons 
she's out to lunch.
just come on!
Yeah okay.
There's been such a lot of faff about so
Is that up?
It's been broken.
Oh has she?
Yeah.
Well, the doctor said it was that.
Yeah.
Erm  because erm  she started Wednesday but they're living at  Stanborough 
Mm.
And, she didn't, she wasn't too bad
But then it
the bones are broken right  down her hand.
And on the Monday morning  my dad rang the doctors and he sent her a prescription  and on the Thursday he had to call him out.
Mm.
And  she coughed that much  she pulled all the  muscles in her ribs.
And he said she'd done more damage with coughing than she had anything 
Yes.
else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She got 
She had another prescription  and  it was nearly three weeks and she still, now, I mean this is like  Five weeks  she's still got like a residual
Mm.
cough.
Mm.
And rubbish  oh she was, I mean she never got out of bad for a week!
Oh no.
My dad, well in fact, we, we were laughing at my dad because we said, we said, it shut her up  for a bit!
Cos, he says I'm   I mean I will , she looks after him all the time
Mm.
but with her being ill it, she says it gave him another sense of duty that
Mm.
he had to look after her.
Look after her, yes.
And he forgot all his own problems for the 
Oh yeah!
week!
Well you do don't you?
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we had to laugh, he said, well can you be ill a bit longer because he, er, he cooked her something to eat and he feeds her and so when I rang up  I never got her on th , I never spoke to her for a week!
She couldn't talk.
Couldn't she?
She said she couldn't even get out of bed, she couldn't do anything.
Twenty five!
He just had to look after her all the time.
Yeah.
But, like, you know, he says  the way it struck her  one minute, you know, she just  a mild cold  and  next minute, he said the next  she's so bad!
Mm!
She couldn't get out of bed nor nothing.
What the heck is this?
Yeah.
It really took hold in a few hours.
Mm.
Well I've heard 
But she  
the, flu, I mean, you hear a lot of people 
Mum!
say  Ooh!
You know they've had flu 
You know you said to dad but 
but they haven't really, they just had bad colds.
I mean I've 
Yeah.
never had the flu
Shall we race?
but I've seen 
Yeah.
what flu can do to people.
If you ca 
If you get flu it's really bad!
Mum, it's come off.
Usually you don't get a 
Terrible!
cold, following a cold with flu, what you 
No.
tend to get with flu is more  aches and pains in your 
Aches and pains 
joints
Yeah.
very bad head
Mm.
and get fever 
I want that !
but when you get a co , like you call flu, it's usually just a head cold.
It is.
It is.
I've never had flu.
But I I don't get many colds and it 
Yeah.
comes out, comes out at New Year's Day, I was at home then and it  erm  going to come back New Year's Day
Yeah.
and then er  they said, oh no I'll let, let us take you through the erm  Conway Tunnel the new 
Oh yeah!
tunnel, you know, so I've been through there 
Yeah.
and  I started that day with this cold 
Yeah.
and  it's not like me.
I one, I once had the flu
Mm.
and I knew I've had it.
I did  it lasted about 
 
Yeah.
three days.
Felt foul!
Yeah.
I felt really
Yeah.
as if 
it's as if you've been anaesthetized!
Yeah.
Cos everything aches and
It
everything's a dead weight and  because you can't, if you move your head it's, it's that much
Much
and all your joints ache.
Mm!
And the trouble is with not moving that thingummy builds up and then you get this very bad cough down your chest.
Yes.
Yeah.
But erm  oh!
Like this cold with me, it's like in my nose and in my 
Yeah.
head, that was all.
You know, I didn't even have a headache.
But, I've 
Mm.
taken it worse.
Well I've had pleurisy.
Anyway , my sister's bought me this  thing to go round my neck.
Because you know 
Mm!
I've got to go and get the .
But she comes 
Mm.
on Monday with it.
Coalite, you know, erm 
Mhm.
just got it round, you know like they had 
Yeah?
er, my orthopaedic pillows 
Mm.
one of those, only just a round one to go  round your neck.
And it  it like warms your neck up.
Cos I tried one of .
But this is smashing!
Oh!
It's like a little neck rest for when you're sitting 
Yes!
in the chair.
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah.
Yes!
My mum's got one.
Oh!
Then 
It's like .
Oh!
Yeah, but I thought, sounded as if they only did tho , those that you blow up and this isn't, you can put it in, in the wash or anything.
Oh right!
To wash.
Oh yeah!
He got it on the market.
It's the same, same thing 
What, made of like foam?
Erm  well I don't know what it's made of  inside.
Er,soft stuff, I don't know.
Oh!
Yeah.
It's great!
Cos my mum bought one for my dad 
Yeah.
because when they go on coach trips
Well that's right.
you can't sleep properly in them.
Do you know, when I went, last one, with the club  I thought I'm not going again!
I was bad for over a week with my neck!
Anyway, they bought me this  you know  and er  and, she said you'll be able to go on your  trips.
Yeah.
We've had a bring and buy today at the club.
Oh have you?
I've been there since  before one!
Rita come and  pick me up, you know,stuff, and er  you know, we did alright.
There'll be a Beetle drive  erm  end of February I think.
Oh are you?
Yeah.
Erm  we owned a little  and just thought I'd ask the party see how many things that cropped up as a result 
John!
of this  er, you know, this  if anybody had had any complaints
Complaints, yeah.
or anybody thought something didn't work right  and erm  Julie's started organizing a plan day again 
And plans , of course she did, yeah.
Yeah.
Cos she's having some sent this year.
Oh is she?
from  Central Ford 
Probably would be better.
Well  she said she didn't mind having at home  but  erm  Terry said  there was too much  for them all
Yes.
to be honest  the mess it must have left her!
And she was worried about getting the stuff up there, and I said 
Mm.
well  there's Jenny's car, there's 
Mm.
my car 
Mm mm.
and even if I can't take it up on the day, I could probably take it up the night before.
Mm.
Mm.
And I don't think anybody'll mind the night before.
No.
And put plenty of newspapers down.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not too sure.
I might find that by then  my days have altered and I will be on the Thursday.
Mm.
At the moment I'm going to have it increased and it is for the, from Friday now.
Oh are yo oh 
So  when 
what at the University?
Yeah.
But 
How 
er
I didn't know you didn't go on a Thursday.
Well I do 
I asked you if you had time, your car there but
See, I did go last week 
Yeah.
on Thursday
Oh!
but I don't got there.
Oh!
Oh I see.
I'm only part-time, part-time there.
Oh are you?
It's less than part-time.
Well I didn't kno a , erm   gonna say?
Are you going in from Ma Manchester.
Well, that's what, I mean 
That's when you're going out with me isn't it?
Yeah.
Er  I mean, all I want  Win, is something to do for four years  than sit at home being a housewife  and hang yourself as well!
Yeah.
I tried for a job.
The answer I tend to get off a lot of places is that  I have to wait for twelve years
Mm.
and  we don't, we don't think that you could do the job.
I know I could do the job, but 
Yeah.
you can't persuade people you can do it.
Oh no!
No.
And working these odd nights in a care, a nursing home, the pay's not good enough to keep a family on.
Oh no!
It's not enough.
So  if I'm going to think long term I've got to got to work
Mm mm.
then I need to be able to get a  a job  that will pay sufficient.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, you only have to earn a little bit and you lose your benefit.
So, you'll be ending up on the breadline worse than ever
Yeah.
for what?
Thought as well, I've never had the chance to go, I'd like to go
Mm.
Mm.
realistically I would like a job  if I could get one  and I'm feeling  very pessimistic about getting one, because the chances of getting a job at my age, when there's youngsters coming around
Mm.
it's not going to be easy but if 
Mm.
if there were any jobs I would be quite happy to take part- time.
Time, yeah.
Yeah.
And I really need a job that
Can supply
I need, I need to have to  to give, I know how we feel but  he's getting older
Mm.
Matthew's getting, you need a, more physical looking after
Mm.
and long term  when the holidays come round he  takes a lot of looking after!
So we really  we  one of us to be here to look after him in that sense, one of us gets paid 
Mm.
to look after him, but in the school holidays, you know, it takes two of you to  and mind him, because 
Yeah.
you need time off in the day  when you're physically resting to  him.
Mm.
But if there's only one of you 
I thought, I dunno 
you can't do it!
I mean, I don't know how yo er ca , cos I I  funny neck, you know 
Well you couldn't though, but bearing in mind 
with my neck 
and we are so much younger 
Younger , that's 
and physically we've got no ailments that are preventing 
That's right.
us from doing it.
Mm.
But he's even becoming a complete, in the holidays when I've got the housework to do and meals to cook, and him to look after  if there's another pair of hands that can take him out for an hour
Mm.
Mm.
and leave you free to do a job, because  you may think  I mean, believe it or  I've turned this room inside out today!
Mm mm.
It doesn't take him two minutes before
Oh I know!
I don't care about the mess 
I mean , yeah I know.
least of your worries 
Oh!
and say get everything out  and toys you 
Yeah!
know, and what I say.
I mean once I've cleared up, you know, when she's gone and  and don't mind seeing  
I I don't mind this.
No.
I have  this room, I've all 
Mm.
the cushions, all 
Mm.
the dining chairs, I've had everything out  at least I haven't cleaned the windows but, I was half way through, well I was almost finished, I'd just just done the stairs though  and Bernie came!
And  I thought well  it's clean
Mm.
I'm not 
Mm mm.
bothered.
No, that's it.
But
That's it.
You can't with 
When he's here 
children you just 
I couldn't, I couldn't start doing it now!
No.
How could you?
And I have cleaned round him, but you know, as quick as I pick them up and throw them in the corner, he gets them out again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then with all these, I mean 
He's bound to.
it's, there's ne , there's a never a 
No, not at all.
there's never a time when there's  flung all over half the time!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er
I just don't know how you cope?
Well I mean I'm, I've got an easy time at the moment because I'm on  today.
I only up to seven hours in a  fortnight.
That's all I want.
Yeah.
Is that a 
Six hours a week.
at home?
No it's here.
It's here.
Oh I know!
Yeah.
Oh!
I didn't realise that!
Six hours a week.
And you go and 
And you always there  a away on holiday?
See a 
Because we always say oh  no Sandra there's nothing, you can't  there 
Well that 
well that was last term.
Everybody in the first term is in in the morning.
Oh!
Four mornings a week, it was compulsory.
And it isn't compulsory this term, if you're doing education.
And er
Oh!
I'm doing education so I'm not in in the morning.
Oh that's why you ta , can take them to school then is it?
Well I was taking them anyway.
I know you were, anyway, it 
Yeah.
goes till eleven didn't it?
Just 
Erm 
after eleven was it?
Ten 
Yeah.
or eleven wasn't it?
The o , the only thing I'm doing now  is the subjects that I want to do
Mm.
on the degree course
Mm.
but, it's education.
And  literally, I got, but I was  got so little on  I felt that if I didn't do some extra
Mm.
Me, I  I mean, I've done  I've done no work today because    I went out to  collect some stuff of a friend this morning  and by the time I came in it was quarter past ten and I'd gone out at ten to nine so I'd missed the schools
Schools, mm.
and I'd told Pat I'd go to  and sing
Mm.
and I've not come back till twelve!
I've I've done 
 
some dinner, we've cleaned up  and Bernard's turned up, have you done any work yet?
I mean, this is me, I'm quite capable  and I make i 
And have you gotta go in the morning?
No, I don't go up till tomorrow afternoon.
Oh!
Tomorrow afternoon, rather, yes.
Well , I've got  fre , I've got bills to pay down town.
Do they have to go every day?
No.
So you haven't, not every day then?
I go, two hours on a Monday
Yeah.
Two hours on a Tuesday, one on a Wednesday  and one on a Friday.
That's it.
Fri , that's it, you see it's all  well it's been like thought int it?
You gotta go 
Well what I 
four times.
what I've actually done 
to get that six hours in.
is I've taken on another  short course.
Mm..
Not, because I need to take it on, but 
No.
when I looked at it  I wanted to do it.
It's only a 
Mm.
four week course, but he's running it for two hours for two weeks.
Oh!
Instead of one hour for four weeks he's 
Mm.
doing two hours for two weeks.
Mm.
And it looks so interesting!
Mm.
And I wanted to do it.
And I  tried to get on it at the beginning of the week but he told me it was fully booked.
Mm.
Well I left my number  so 
Mm.
that, any cancellation she'd ring me up.
Well I'd already spoken to the man who was running the course, the lecturer and he told me I could go on it, but his secretary said it was booked.
Oh!
I mustn't have been out of that office half an hour and I'd, she'd rung here and left a message to say I could go on it.
Oh!
And there were two more people in front of me that was waiting to go on  the course.
The course, yeah.
Any road, erm  when I went back to see her she said  of the ones who came and asked to go on it, we've accepted you, but no more.
But, if I hadn't have gone on Monday
Monday
I wouldn't have got on.
Wouldn't have got in.
No.
And we only went 
No.
we went back Friday for exams
Yeah.
and then we went back in on Monday.
Oh you're doing well aren't you with your exams, so Mary 
Well  
tells me?
Yeah , I've had erm
Cos I keep as ,a ask Mary you know, when I 
I've had 
see her.
four  four points  I've got three on the B's
Mm.
and I got one on the C's.
Well C's count but it's the bottom pass.
Yes , I know.
Erm  and it's quite, you know   and it's a subject I've never done before
Mm.
and the woman who took the course she did say  had she had done the reading work  it 
Mm.
wouldn't have been the reading that we were given, because she said the brief in the  erm  th the work that we've had to read 
Mm.
Mm.
was far too  erm  advanced  for people who had never done the subject before.
She said, I don't care whether you are at university, there are certain areas that  you need to know a lot more background before you can do it at this level.
Yes.
Mm.
And, the reading lists were unbelievable!
And we couldn't get half the books out the library because other courses had taken them, we 
Mm.
had ever such a job getting them!
I mean, I know, one, one essay I had to write  erm  wa was erm  literally what constituted a person as far as philosophy?
Mm.
I mean, you know what makes a person up, you know, heads 
Mm.
arms, legs, bodies 
Yeah.
but, what makes ea up a person in the mind?
Mm.
And  the other subject, that we had an essay on  oh!
I know which one!
Co could a person survive, can a, can a person, and he put person in inverted commas, not for the  the physical body, but to be the person inside the body
Mm.
could they survive their own death?
And if you, if you had  a religious knowledge
Mm.
that dead, there is a life hereafter
Mm.
then the answer has to be yes.
Mm.
But you have to show how you believe  that the person in you survives their own death.
Mm.
Well  I mean, I could have said it in about ten words, yes I believe they can because, but that didn't answer the question, you had to do  between fi er
So many words, words?
a thousand and fifteen hundred words.
Words , yeah.
And I'm not, oh Win!
I've not thought of any kind of death.
And I got myself  you've got use other  philosophers
Mm.
erm  work, to prove your  theory.
Yeah.
Well, I got myself all tied up between the  the who said what and me which said where and
Mm.
and I found it really
Mm.
difficult
Mm.
I know!
to put it into words.
Mm.
Well, I must admit I got about the bottom mark.
And then  she's written nearly as much in red ink on the back  as I've written it on black ink on 
Black ink.
the front !
Mm.
Has he gone out?
And er  she erm  she said, I know what you wanted to say  and I appreciate that you find it difficult to put it into words
Mm.
and the biggest tragedy  is that I know you know what you want to say 
Say.
Mm.
but I can't mark you on what you've not put.
Mm.
In the class see  actual oral  erm  knowledge, I could talk with any of them and put my point a , and I could come up with ideas  couldn't put it down in 
Down 
writing.
Yeah.
Mm.
So she put a few ideas on the back and said when you do the next one  try following these ideas  of organizing the different  parts of the essay.
Erm  there were two at the end  discuss the works of either Descartes or  oh, can't think of the other one!
And, the other one was erm  are the attributes of  !
Ooh!
Er, are there special attributes or personal attributes only found in humans?
What it's asking, and it's a  most ambiguous question, I mean, I think the question was
Mm.
didn't make sense!
It  did machines  are machines people don't you think?
Like computers.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Are we producing machines that now have brains and minds that think?
Well, the answer to that is, no.
Mm.
I mean if 
 
if I'm put on a ladder with a television set then forget it, because 
Yeah.
I'm no  you know
Mm.
but  I sat down and we hadn't actually done the lecture  well I couldn't do this other one because  I didn't understand this
No.
er  reading  and I ha , I couldn't hold of enough of the material in the time I'd got to write the essay  so I wouldn't have studied enough, so I did this one on machines, and I got hold of two good books.
And they were really interesting to read!
Compared to what we've had to read.
So I wrote this essay
Mm.
and  she put on the back of this one  she was thankful that at least I'd managed this time to get the mark in the area where it should have been in the first 
To be in there.
place.
Mm.
And, I mean, she was a brilliant  woman for lecturing 
Mm.
this subject!
Mm.
And it was just a pity that  the material she was given  or told us to read, she said was too advanced for us.
Mm.
But when you go in on a subject like philosophy, to jump in at that level  how adjusted you are  it's difficult if you've not got any academic background to suddenly come in and have to start doing it.
I mean, psychology was as bad!
Yeah.
I found that difficult!
Mm.
My nephew got on A in  philosophy!
Mm.
And he, he says erm  he didn't really study that much because he was going, like, he was erm  doing languages  and er  because they  they were, moaned at him for not keeping up cos of this project, quite a few of them, you know 
Yeah.
and he took philosophy and got A in it!
Yeah.
He does er  supply teaching.
He, he 
Yeah.
went over to Australia now, he went to America and  like, went to Australia now!
Mm.
Because supply teaching he finds it  pays better than 
I suppose it's  it's a better rate of pay but
It pays  it pays better.
It's if you're on enough books  to be able to get supply for every day, if you don't mind just flitting around.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er, if you get known as a good supply teacher you'll get the work to  to begin with, you might only get an odd day.
He, he was thrilled because he he got er, his name on the board so the head
Oh!
of two subjects
Come on John!
Mummy's here!
Mm.
  
Go get your shoes.
Oh!
Go get your shoes!
We're hiding mummy!
Ah!
Oh!
Oh !
John!
Alright then, bye!
One down  
One.
Mm.
What time is the other one gone?
He'll say, my mum says I have to be home for seven.
He's been here since  what?
Twenty to four.
Yeah.
I always wonder when he ac 
I dunno, I don't know what the time is?
Do you want 
Mm?
not so bad, it must have knocked the telly on.
Oh I see now!, the power?
Oh 
No.
no, did he  he, he dropped something down was it 
Well it's twenty five to five.
Twenty five to five?
Yeah.
Yes.
I must be going.
Except this Matthew.
Looks like  somebody should er
Oh it, well  has he dropped something down there?
I heard something drop but what would it be?
No erm, I couldn't get this to 
There's nothing down there he could have done.
No, I couldn't get the television on earlier so I'm thinking he
Oh!
I see.
he sort of must have switched it off and switched it back on.
Oh!
Oh!
But you have to use the box.
Mm.
Oh I know.
Having trouble with my on off erm 
Are you?
I'm waiting for them to  well they're going to fix it soon.
You know, it seems everything round now goes wrong!
Oh yes, he's been round there for the  new .
Oh!
Now it rains underneath and  oh er  the switch is gone and I'm waiting  cos they're a shop, I think they've never been down, while they're waiting for the rep to come.
You see, so he has to just  plug it into the wall.
Mhm.
You know.
And I'll have to find another
Oh!
another, yeah.
In the  it's only just till the rep comes he said, when I saw her last week she said like  you know, he hadn't been if he
No.
Oh I usually watch telly as you 
Yeah.
know.
I'm not gonna 
Well when the kids 
leave it then 
when the kids are in here, I don't get to watch any of my programmes.
But they've 
Lovely!
gone upstairs to play on the computer so er 
Mm.
Well erm  oh oh oh!
Tony up there, he's had meningitis you know,at risk he said.
And she was saying, I don't really believe, it was quite  quite sort of used to have a beeper on him
Yeah.
that's so so that he breathes  properly.
Yeah.
Now he's been taken ill with this so, she hopes that he don't  and get behind you know  but it's the head in it?
And 
Yeah.
er
I mean I'm quite happy up there, you know  even if at the end I don't get to end  I mean I'd like to get to 
Has long does that go for?
It's four years!
It's four years?
I mean
I could have had it   
I might 
It's 
Well 
four years?
Yeah, because this first year is an induction year.
Oh!
If you haven't got a qualif 
I was gonna say because Peter  is with the three year 
Yeah , it is three years 
And then, because he went in er, he didn't want, he, he wanted  er go as a teacher
He did another 
he did 
year.
another twelve months a , well he passed, that's right, so he did four.
You ca , you can do, it can master five, because you can do this  er, if you haven't got the A levels
Mm.
you need to this first year  and it gets you up to that level 
I see.
Oh yeah.
Well 
right?
you did O levels, yes.
Then you do the three years 
Mm.
degree
Mm.
then you do the teaching certificate which 
Mm.
is another, so it could be five.
I know that's how , how he did the 
Right?
four.
Yes?
But, what you can do at  is the teaching certificate with the degree  which is what I'm doing.
oh I see!
Ah!
So his final year he does teaching
Yeah, for four years.
I'm doing it through the four years of the course.
Mm.
Mm.
If you go on 
Oh yeah.
the foundation U,yo you've got the option to start the teaching certificate in the first year.
Oh I see.
So, where he's done the extra year at the end  if I do this extra year at the beginning I can start the teaching certificate.
Yeah!
He decided right at the end he wanted teaching.
And he 
Yeah.
stayed on, he he  passed something in exam or something  and
Yeah.
he stayed on.
Yeah.
And then after that  erm, he said well, well he can  please himself and I suppose he he erm, well I think er,year.
So many of them from Uni they  these children in America  and erm 
Mm.
schooling, you know  erm  people there that erm  got money
Yeah.
and they've got the children in, you know, these .
Yeah.
and so many of them now  they go, er to erm
Mhm.
America.
Mm.
And er  it was all paid for, you know  and it's for three months, and then  they're getting six weeks off I think  and he went to do some fishing down in Canada and all that.
But, for three months he never had  you know, seven days a week like, you know.
Mm mm.
And er, since then he come back, he got a job  his name was on the board, he said, oh it's lovely seeing your name on the board, the head, er, and in two subjects!
You know?
He just gave it up like that and he went to Australia!
He's, he's never married, he's twen , twenty eight.
He's
Mm.
No he isn't, he's twenty nine.
Er, let me think, Catherine's twenty six, he isn't, he's damn well thirty!
Catherine's twenty six
Yeah.
Yeah,he must be  thirty.
And erm  now he's a supply teacher in  now he's got a band or something , I dunno.
No.
Do your own thing while you can.
Just doesn't want to go back to, he likes Australia as well!
And he liked Canada better than America.
Mm mm.
And erm  well he just wants to enjoy himself I think.
A girl who I go with, she's been teaching as well and her husband's already  in the hope that when she finishes they're going to emigrate to America to .
Mm.
Because  like she said, here  he's been made redundant once, and he stands another chance of just starting 
Yeah!
another school and he's 
Terrible!
all set for it again!
Terrible!
Terrible!
It's going to be around again they've only got so many people .
Yeah.
I mean, I'm sort of looking realistically that after four years that the education system changes
Mm.
there won't be enough jobs.
Mm mm.
But  I'll have done something for four years.
I won't 
Yeah.
have been sitting here
Yeah.
doing part-time work
Mm.
feeling as if I'm not using the resources I've got.
That's it.
And I get annoyed!
Mm.
And I know, I suppose people said oh, well, why put yourself through it?
But, you know, I thoroughly enjoy it!
Mm.
I really do!
I was going to say, if you enjoy it  why not?
I e , enjoy the process of of 
Why not?
finding things out.
Yeah.
Some of it I find  a bit er  a bit too obvious but in the same way  erm  on, on the sociology side, I get a bit angry because I see what society does to people.
People.
That's right.
And theoretically, it sounds wonderful!
Mm.
And it doesn't work like that.
Mm.
You know
Mm.
if it worked like they  say things work  it would all be nice for everybody, and it isn't.
Mhm.
It isn't, no.
Yeah.
So, I do get a bit ac , I mean,th there's, there's one young girl in the class  and, we were on about women's role in society  and going on about third world woman, but even western woman have their position, you know, she does the housework 
Mm.
and 
Mm.
the shopping and the cooking  and  the sa , she made a remark,abo , and I said well it's always the same even if you go out to work it's still your job
Job, yeah.
and she said  well my mother goes out to work, but we help.
And I said, well what do you mean, you help?
She said well we all help on the weekends, even my dad helps, I said, but  who actually makes the decisions about what you do, what you eat, what you buy
Mm.
how you cook it, when you have it, who actually runs the house?
Well we all, I said no!
One of you actually runs  the finances, the shopping
Mm.
the decisions to be made, who's responsibility is, cos you just said, we help, you don't make those decisions, your mum 
No.
still takes on the responsibility there!
Yeah.
And, at the end of a we , when I put it back into the, the conversation
Mm.
it was  well, erm  I do my bit.
I said, well your mum's been out to work five days a week and you just help
Mm.
you know, you should do it
Mm.
if that's  not her role, but you've given her that role.
Yeah.
But she 
Yeah.
likes to do it!
I said, how do you know she likes to do it?
Does anybody ever say to her, well I'll do it 
Oh I know!
instead?
Mm.
I said, are you married?
She said no.
I said, well are you likely to be?
She said, well yes but I'm not having any kids, I said probably that's a good  thing, but  I said  she was so selfish in her attitude!
Yeah, that's it.
She would help so that was all it needed!
Mm.
Mm.
I said the onus on the woman in the house  to think, to plan, to prepare  it's her!
Yeah.
There are a few men that do it
Mm.
but by and large, most men say, oh well the wife all the time.
Mm.
And if it's not right, then it's  well it's your fault!
Fault.
And in a lot of marriages the wife's total responsibility and if it wasn't done she is the one responsible.
Mm.
This is how a lot of them fall the by the wayside because 
Yeah.
husbands think their fault is they've no money, when  in all accounts  he's probably had more to spend on his luxuries than she's had on food.
Mm.
But if you just can't manage it's her fault!
Fault.
Not the rising prices and things.
And it was this young girl's attitude!
I was amazed!
And I said well I, all I'm saying, I was really angry!
Mm mm.
I was getting so  with her!
Because I said, you're another woman!
You're a selfish .
You don't even 
Yeah.
understand the first principles of what being a woman is, if that's what 
Mm.
you think!
Mm.
Well there were other married ones  in the group
Mm.
and there was another with a child
Mm.
And she said to her afterwards  she said  oh!
I could have gone mad, you know, but  the tragedy is that during the courses a lot of them  and I expect that the best time to learn is when you're young and you're more receptive.
Well yes!
That's right.
But they've no experiences a lot of 
No.
them
No.
No.
and they're not appreciating how difficult it is for some of them families to send them there.
Oh!
And a lot of them do waste that time.
Mm.
Did ex , even went to  so that the .
Did they?
Yeah.
Some of them 
Three years term.
Er, the following year's term.
They come
And asked why, well I know why she didn't turn into the morning lectures  well I don't get up usually, till half eleven, twelve o'clock.
Oh!
I said, what do you mean?
She said, I'm not an early riser.
I said, but you've got to get up to get to the 
Mm.
lectures.
I can't, she says.
I says well  you can if you set the alarm the clock!
Mm.
Oh!
She says, I can't get up early!
I said
Good grief!
there are a lot of people 
 
in this place who have got up and done a day's work before they've come here!
I said I, even I've got up and got children up and off to school.
I said, I've got my own responsibility, that's mine, I said, but you're only responsibility is to be in that lecture for ten o'clock.
You've only got to roll out of bed 
Good grief!
walk across the road!
She said, I don't like getting up before half eleven, twelve o'clock!
Ah!
Oh!.
And, I said and you're being supported  to stay here!
She said, everybody's helping.
I said, and this is what you're doing Anna?
You're not turning up?
Every time I co , I put my face to the window they go, oh no, he's back again!
So I erm
You started before I am.
I know I am.
I can't help it if I'm handsome!
Ooh!
Your vain as well aren't you?
Well just, I am, I a , I mean, I ain't bothered anyhow!
I'll  my dad went in there he said  do you mean, do they take your ?
He said erm  he said you can take it out can't you?
I said, I don't want to.
Oh then I'll change my mind, he said wanna leave work here like.
He said, oh you're modest are we?
I said, yeah!
Said  he said well you could you take it er, and scare your friends?
I said, it's okay well we've got a  instead and I went.
How long you been going up the Rainbow Centre?
Erm  I er, I don't go every day, I go every Thursday like.
Er, well I don't go weekly like 
No.
Ooh!
I just go on a Thursday, but I don't go week 
 
you see?
Cos er  I, like I should, really I wouldn't have bothered going today.
I'd have gone the next Thursday after like.
Cos, today was really a waste of my time cos there's only half that do you see.
But, if I'd gone next Thursday there'd be e English, and then it'd be a a job for them if they
If they're hard.
they're hard, yeah like and my, my my dad wouldn't take .
I ju , it, you see I'll, I  work until the end nearly eleven o'clock in the day to yo , to work start work today like on the art.
So I start straightaway you know.
So how long you been going up the Rainbow Centre?
Can't think in the arts, in the art bit so I just  I just go in for a coffee as well, yeah.
So it'll be .
All the women say  they can't wait to get rid of me!
I say you can't, you love me really don't you?
Say  oh yeah, we love you, yeah!
But we got rid of you!
Things like that, you know.
I mean, you can get on with people like that that you've never met before you co , to get on at college exactly the same.
And yet you can actually
I ju , it's  you see I I 
 
would have  
Are they jam?
until the end
What?
nearly  eleven o'clock  
I think he's taken yours on there.
Got to start work at  
He has!
You can take these.
And I started straightaway, you know, like
No,!
I can't think in the art, in the art thing cos I like to  I'd just finished my coffee as well and
You've got to repeat everything on the board is he?
Yeah.
All the women say  they can't wait to get rid of me!
I say, you can't, you love me really don't you?
Say, oh yeah!
We love you, yeah!
But we got rid of you!
Things like that, you know.
Is that my colouring?
We're just joking .
Well if you can get on with people like that that you've never met before you can, you'd get on at college it's just the same.
Yeah, so if you can't find one I'll use the one what I was gonna do.
So that erm
Over there.
Do you want a cup of tea then?
Right down
What?
Yeah.
Has Ian taken yours on then?
He has.
You can take these?
And I think that you'd have to have
Yeah.
 
another word after that.
Go on, off you go then!
Ah er, yeah I've just thought of one.
Make your own up.
It's not fair if I help is it Matthew?
You've got this .
Yeah, but looking at college  like  I've come from school like, and I never liked it at school.
Different
I mean that
entirely different set up!
It i don't look at it as school
Is that my  
college is adult education, and the fact that you're all adults  the relationship between you and the lecturers is not the same between you and teachers.
In a class, where you were at school, they told you what to do.
Well maybe it's because I look at it as a school like that's 
You shouldn't!
it.
Well I just got this thing, you know, about
You shouldn't.
something 
But  you've got an adult 
there.
relationship between you and the lecturer.
And it's up to you to learn what they're telling you.
If you don't learn, at school they'd give you detention and lines and punish you for not doing it, if you don't do it at college it'll be your mistake and your fault
I  learn alright.
but you'll learn because you want to and not because you're made to, and there's a difference.
Yeah , but sometimes you, I go , got  I told dad about this lad, got this this lad, he's crazy and that keeps, keeps  erm  joking and everything, running around acting a right fool like yo , and that!
I mean, I'm scared of anything up, they'll be some  conflict and you do get these kind of people in college as well it frightens me  
You wouldn't get them at night college, because people who go to night school go because they want to learn, and if there's any  you've got running around as you call it, will be thrown out!
Cos lecturers at night  cos they're not compelled.
People aren't made to go to college at night, people go because they want to.
If you muck about in the class the lecturers have got every right to send you off the course.
But er, this guy, he's crazy!
Erm  I got blamed, I think that I was er, doing his  like if you taking his er  what do you call them
When you come out of there  I mean, if you do like we  when I've ever gone I take my shampoo with me  and you can have a shower and wash your hair, get the chlorine off you  and they do sell  er, chips upstairs and they're not very expensive.
You can have cup of soup out the machine for about twenty pence.
That's sounds as if it's pretty cheap.
And I mean, if you set a list to do something for a day Yeah.
I mean, by the time you'd set off walking you could set off at eleven and walk there till twelve  go in there till two  then you 
Have you ever been to the pictures in that po , in erm  oh what do you call the ?
In Festival Park.
Yeah, we went
Oh, how much is it to get the pictures, I mean
If you go  at the six o'clock showing, Monday to Friday  it's two pound ten pence for you.
Yeah?
That's, that's cheaper than the one,th the one up , about 
What 
two pounds fifty up there.
No.
If you go the six 
 
it's gone up, it's two po , it's gone up to two twenty hasn't it?
It was always cheaper.
But if you go  any other showing or on a weekend  it's three pound eighty.
Well it's it's it's it's much more expensive up in the  you know the Hanley one?
The Cannon was always cheaper.
That's, that's expensive.
But , if you go at the six o'clock showing here  it's two pound ten pence for you.
That's , it's about two pounds fifty at erm, for me to get into the 
It was 
Hanley one.
No.
It was two pound, and one eighty on the six o'clock showing.
But it's just gone up to two pound twenty.
Yeah.
But, I mean, it's nice at the Festival Park one,i it 
Yeah.
but go for the six o'clock showing  cos it's two pound ten pence.
Yeah.
I mean, that's alright, but when you think you're spending two pound ten pence and then, if you come out and you want a drink
Yeah.
and you 
Mum!
And you want .
Is this a word?
S O E?
Sorry, what?
Er erm

But it was too  th the, the language on it wasn't, it wasn't bad language but it 
No.
was difficult for them to understand because 
Yeah.
it was more mature language.
But then we went to see Suburban Commando.
Oh!
Oh that's good 
Hulk Hogan.
that is!
With erm 
Oh it was fantastic!
with erm 
It's hilarious!
Er  I like 
And it 
it when they go up to camp 
Well we have W W F wrestling on here you know.

But  erm  I said I'd take, we went to see another one as well, erm  oh that  Cu erm  I'll tell you what i , what we went  Curly Sue we went to see.
Oh!
Cur , oh I keep thinking of going to see that one.
Yeah, just a 
That , that's funny, but  I think for you  Suburban Commando would have been better.
Yeah.
It's still on.
But it's only on now  er  weekends.
And the cheap showing  is twenty past eleven in the morning on a Saturday.
Don't care!
Erm  what's on at Cannon.
It isn't on there, it's finished.
But that really was, it was funny!
Mm.
Er, ha, that was good when she said, says er  he said okay,yo , take the bag then.
Hot Shots, we went to see that was it.
Yeah.
But
Hot Shots.
the, the, the ha , the humour is too adult for th , these to understand.
Yeah.
They said twelve, but I think really  for the humour alone they needed to be about fifteen or sixteen because they didn't understand it.
Yeah.
We went to see  Suburban Commando 
and then went to see Curly Sue.
Right.
Hello.
Hello!
I thought it might be.
You've just interrupted my thinking session here!
Ooh I know, but it's staying off so you'll realise why!
Yes, I'll be in the morning.

Alright.
I'll get back in from the kids ou , you know, literally, a minute past nine, so  yeah.
Okay then.
Bye!
Er, I mean, I don't go  not because I don't enjoy the pictures but I think that it's got to be something really special.
Yeah.
But over the Christmas holidays I was prepared to take them.
I didn't fancy Hot Shots, but I took them.
Yeah.
I fancied Suburban Commando, and that really is funny!
And then I took 
I love ca , some comedy 
Yeah.
like!
I like 
and then we went to see the Curly Sue
a good laugh.
no it's brilliant!
It really 
Yeah.
is funny!
But if you were going and choosing a pa , a film, I'd have said you'd have preferred the Hulk Hogan one.
Yeah.
But er
I would do, yeah, I like that one that's 
I mean , this one doesn't look bad does it?
Dunno.
What's it called?
Frankie and Johnny.

He er  forgot my comb or summat  and something like that, he said I've forgotten my comb and  we might be going out.
I mean, some films I think they're pathetic in  so much that the story 
Yeah.
line is very poor!
Yes.
And they try and do it with a lot of gimmickry and
Yeah.
the way they do the filming.
Yeah.
And, if the story line isn't very good, I don't care what they with effects  the film doesn't work.
Yeah.
But that Suburban Commando
Ah!
That was good-un that!
I'd like that.

Yeah, it's brilliant!
And I watched er, some of their clips coming on the T V like.

That's an advert.

Book him Danna!
He couldn't say that this time cos he was i , he was erm, the guy in hospital.
He's the one that, somebody tried to assassinate him or someone  tried to kill him off .
I must admit, er there are some good television programmes now, but they're  a lot of rubbish in compared to the
Yeah.
story lines that you, you used to get on some of the 
Yeah.
old series.
Oh.
It seems that  they make so many now that they don't have the same
Yeah.
quality of 
That's it.
er entertainment in them.
Yeah.
All we got now is adverts  television is a
Well the ads are a lot better sometimes than the programmes!
Yeah.
I used to watch erm  tt, oh erm  Hawaii Five O every Saturday or Friday.
I mean, it used to be on a Friday, then it used to be on a Saturday, only sometimes like  I used to watch it.
I used to sit there  Da da da da da    good fun !
You know, it was a great laugh like!
Now you just  and sit there watch it now.
I just thought I'd watch for the, you know  I think it's on every erm  it's on every da , ways you know  Hawaii Five O is  showing the old things again.
I used to like the Invisible Man as well.
He could vanish into thin air.
Yes!
I used to like that.
Oh.
I used to like it when he takes his head off!
He'd take his bandages off.
Oh I've been wa , well I've watched all of them, right, but they've made so many of those from er  really old ones to the very new one.
Oh.

In there.
Oh well you can't then.
See  he's trying to get me.
See there's a word there, wax.
And in fact, waxers, one who waxes  or waxes.
Yeah.
I'm going here.
Oh!
I don't like seeing that.
This is mine, this is the side I like.
It's live at eight o'clock in the morning.
Because the Europea 
 
er, well the European clock is an hour behind us
Yeah.
so it's actually nine o'clock and they start.
'kin hell!
And
Ni nine o'clock in their  
Yeah.
like?
Yeah.
And  it's been coming from Austria this week
Yeah.
and it's been er  oh it's absolutely fantastic, I think!
Yeah.
But  I wouldn't have the nerve to do what they're doing.
'kin hell!
But the exhilaration of watching them come down.
Yeah.
And sometimes they've got  one that comes on a test run with a camera strapped onto them and you come 
I bet that's nice!
Oh!
I mean they come 
 
at  they come over a hundred miles an hour on some of these runs!
I know, and I hate it when they go  straight up over the hills like and they
Mm!
do a  a somersault straight over and come back down.
But I mean, look at the scenery 
Yeah.
though!
Yeah.
I mean  you see all these mountains and  I mean it just looks that beautiful and
Yeah,
er clear.
I mean, there's no  smog a, and there's no cloud or smoke anywhere is there?
Yeah.
It's ice isn't it, ice underneath that snow innit?
Well it'll be packed ice 
 
you know, with them coming down it so much.
Yeah.
I don't like tennis either.
I love tennis.
Do, who was it was on here yesterday, erm  the one that throws temper tantrums?
It's blinking  !
Oh well all you've got to do  it's in erm
Can you pick what you want to?
Yeah?
No!
I say whether you can go and then  I've put it in there.
Anthony got all the words and put them in and there's this one and he's got all the good .
I'm getting to like this.
So it picks it up when you just do anything?
Yeah.
It's got seven different audio channels and you pick up languages on them.
Yeah?
Three comes out in British.
Typical!
Pick all these
Mm.
Two hundred and fifty pound that was.
'kin hell!
Expensive!
You got a lot though.
I wouldn't have bought it, but it was brought as a Christmas present
Yeah.
for the kids  because there's a little man out there  who's the only one in the family who didn't have it.
I wouldn't buy it.
And then I said well  I will buy it as a joint sort of joint family Christmas present
Yeah.
because he went on so much  and then it was bought for him.
So
But er  I said it's nice, something like that though.
Yeah.
Harry 
 
and I like it for the  the sports, like the 
Yeah.
skiing, the round up of the sports.
And you get some 
Yeah.
entertaining unusual sports that come on, but also, there's a news programme on, twenty four hour news.
They mix in
Yeah.
a sports round up every now and again, and then you get the American C B S news comes on.
Oh.
And you'll get world news.
Yeah.
But if you come on when it's the British news  you tend to get  a, a more in-depth programme, it lasts longer 
Yeah.
you get more than just the highlights of the news.
So, yeah.
Who's that?
No!
Women don't like being huffed and puffed at!
No, I, no I don't.
I don't get huff , I don't.
Shame they huff and puff at me, oh I don't like it!
No.
They, they don't like it when you stand and laugh and  you know, joke with them and that.
Joke about it and all that, they don't like it then.
Is it er  you know  only little girls like I mean, crumbs!
Yeah!
I've got one.
And when you talk sensibly to them and that  you know, about ja , that   and too old for you like that, something like that  I, I get really erm  you know, really  erm  when they erm  they, they start to laugh but you're not quite funny and that.
So all I do, you gotta jo , joke about it all that.
Yeah.
So it makes it erm  in fact, it does upset them sometimes, you know, we, you know like the other way around  they can't stand it when you  you know, when you can er  hate it like that.
If you don't take it, you know, if you can't take the joke they give you, they just  they get really upset about it.
Oh.
Ho .
She's crazy!
Driving me mad!
Then she erm  she told me a lie this time as well!
I erm, did something to her friend like erm  you know, this lad she's supposed to be going with, I dunno what she's doing with him or anything.
And I'm not bothered if she's, cos she, he's er, she's he's, she's going out with him or anything.
Just if she'll, you know, just if she could be friends with me still, you know, and that?
But erm  anyway, she told a lie to me this time.
See she, she came around cos erm  I've been up to her, her friends place to  and give him a bit of a telling off like and that  and erm  she came to John's house   and I said, why are calling?
I said  you only come round to see me cos, you know, cos I al I always wanted to come round and see you so  and she won't.
And she says, I haven't come round to see you actually!
I've come round to see John.
This is like her, ex-husband like.
And I said okay.
Well I'm just joking by saying  you've come round to see me haven't you?
And that, and sh , and she goes, no I've only come round to see John cos of his birthday you see.
So er  I thought a alright then, so I  I went off like  and I just heard erm   and said, I went up to see her mother like and, I told her mother about it, like and that  and erm  her mother says different now, that she came round to see me at the time to tell, to give me a telling off like  over her friend.
So I mean, John was right, she did come to see me that time.
And
Ah!
But she didn't want you to know about this.
Yeah.
And another thing, she didn't have to do  well her mother's erm  her mother-in-law seems a bit erm bad tempered with her, like, she's  is that she didn't have to tell John, her ex-husband that  there's anything the matter like  and and, and that's when she  she, all she wants to do is get him against me.
She's trying to make me and him enemies.
Cos me and him are good friends, like.
He likes me and, and I like him, he's  we've both got things in, in common, like.
She's probably jealous then of your relationship with him.
Might be, yeah.
She could be.
I dunno.
I mean, if she had a marriage with him and she had the relationship and now you're a good friend to him, and you're a friend to her, she's probably very jealous of the fact that you're 
Mm.
friends with her ex-husband.
Yeah.
Well, could be.
I thought of that.
I , things keep going through my head every time  my head's like it got this little  what do you call it in, one of those erm  like a live wire, just keeps going up and down and all the time.
I'm trying to work out why she's mad all the time, why she's  she's down on everything.
And I can't understand her, I can't keep up with her!
You know?
I mean, I mean, you know, John, you should see him he's happy!
Every time I go to see him, like, he's happy as anything like.
He's a good guy!
Okay, he's a  I think, then again, sometimes I think why she left him is because the way his, his house is, you see.
Cos the way he has his house  it's like er been a  okay he's off  er, I know it may sound nasty what I say about him, but he's alright, he's a good guy like, his house is a bit of a  upside down place, like 
Mm.
it's only cos he's had it done up and that.
And erm  her place is  oh, it's just really lovely inside, everything!
You know, really warm, the fire's on, everything and  and nice and cosy and everything like.
And, and I think  is it that because she left him?
I was trying to think of all these things like she's done like.
I dunno, I'm just, I give up on her anyway!
I haven't seen her for  two weeks now.
Trying to pack up seeing her now !
It's like er er  but now I've heard her telling this lie again, I mean, oh, I'm thinking of going and seeing her again.
Asking her what's she doing it for?
Yeah, why , why.
I dunno  I can't understand it though!
Mm.
I mean, why didn't she tell me the truth, I can understand you know, I could, you know, I could perha if she'd just tell me the truth you know  tell me why she's u , what she's up to and that.
Why does she have to tell me lies like, I mean  what's she trying to hide  you know?
It's like she's got some  big thing going  like, got some big drugs thing going, like, and she's trying to hide!
Some big thing, you know.
And there's nothing to it, I mean  crumbs!
Probably just her own 
Oh.
personal problems that she  she knows that if she loses her temper with you she won't really offend you.
Perhaps 
Well that 
that's a good thing that you are a friend to her, that you'll take her  tempers and you'll still come back.
And the fact that she can  lose her temper with you
Mm.
you, you are just  at the end of  the line, and you take it off her so you take the pressure off her.
She probably thinks a lot more about you for being able to 
Yes.
take that pressure from her.
I know.
I always feel, I always feel, what do you call it, for punishment though?
You're masochist?
Yeah, I'm maso 
 
Thank you !
I think she could be truthful.
Keep going back for more and more.
True.
Yeah.
And er
Sound a bit more like you're Nightmare on Elm Street!
True, yeah!
Blinking,e every time I walk into that place.
Nobody comes to see you!
You know, once  when I was in Wembley like, another thing that I've  noticed that changed in our place  at Wembley, like  every time I used to go in there, all, well, when I used to be in there, like, all the lads would be in the office with her like  talking to her, and laughing and smiling and  and she used to be at the desk smiling and everything  and now, when I walk in there now  it's only me like on a Saturday, and it's only her like  nobody else is in there with her, she's al , she always  she's got, I think what's happened is she got too deep into her work  that she's  she just seems to take all her work now  and that.
Cos she doesn't have any relationships with the other 
Yeah.
people that were there.
Yeah.
So erm  and here's another thing as well, she says erm  I said  why don't you pack this job in like?
And you know, you know, I feel li , I feel like she's  she's a nice woman like, you know, I say, why don't you pack the job in?
She says, I can't now I've gotta keep my family.
And, and that, cos tha , cos she hasn't got her husband anymore, her husband's got a good job like, getting well into, something like and  he's got, got loads of money!
He's got really lovely car and everything, and  and that, got nice house and  and er  anyway she's  she says I can't.
Says I've gotta keep my family now cos she's keeping her, er  daughter in what do you call it, and her son like, every time he comes up.
And  and when she had er  well  like she says, I can't now.
But I, I don't understand, now she can't  but if she went back to her husband  he's got money, I mean, he can look after her as 
Yeah, but 
well.
going back to him just cos he's got money, if she doesn't love him any more and she can't live with him because of the relationship.
Yeah.
You can't compromise your feelings just because of the money.
Yeah.
But I mean  it's not just that, she's killing herself for the job like!
Sa , she  her eyes are getting blacker every time and she  she just seems to be in her books all the time, and everything now.
I mean, she doesn't stop work, she never stops work!
She goes on and on and on!
Well when you're being paid for doing a job that's the price you pay if you want to keep in work.
Well I wouldn't do that.
I don't think I could do that.
Well you'd have to i 
It'd kill me!
If you've got responsibilities of a family and you've got to keep them, then, as a mother she knows she's got her children to look 
Yeah.
after.
She'll stay there even if she doesn't like it because she's got to provide for them.
That's a responsibility you take on with a family.
Yeah.
Or even if she doesn't like, and as much as she says, well she doesn't like it  she can't give it up until they're old enough not 
Yeah.
to be a responsibility to her.
Yeah, well I think it's through her job she's left her husband like.
Her husband was the one who got her the job as well!
And I mean, well she's married and everything, and kids.
I could understand that in , I could understand that he's 
Yeah.
probably left her because of the job in that sense
He didn't leave 
because 
her, she 
she 
left him.
well
He le , I think he left 
but probably 
her because 
Yeah.
she couldn't  she just didn't smile every time like, she was  it's like, I think it's something to do with, sounds like it's something to do with the parents maybe.
Something like, you don't know, I just, I ge , all these things like, keep just coming into your head all 
Mind you, the relationships between 
the time.
the man and a wife  you'd never know what the problem was because the relationships that will be private to them.
Yeah I know.
Well I don't know 
But they'd let you 
well I know that.
they'd never let you into that.
I know.
Well  to that, I just
Mm.
I keep everything to myself.
But it, it just seems funny, you know!
The way she treats me, now.
Cos I'm a bit like John, like  happy, you know  I'll laugh every time like and  he'll have a joke and that  and erm  John's happy, and he'll laugh.
And he's into heavy metal and  and we, we both seem to have things in common like  and she do doesn't like me and she doesn't erm  you know, she seems the same with me as as she is with John.
And this other guy she's going with now  he doesn't smile, nothing!
He, I I used to hi to him, like  he used to work at Wembley as well and I used to go, obviously we were walking, coming out of the place like, and I'd say  I'd go, hi there!
And he'd go, and he'd just  just walk on like!
Ignore me!
Mm.
He wouldn't smile, nothing!
No.
Seems down all the time.
They're probably both very happy in their misery together.
Well I dunno.
Could be.
You know  I wish I was, I could be happy in misery.
Mm!
Mm!
You know.
But I can't, me, I mean, I've gotta be happy cos a  it's the only thing  today, is happy.
Yeah.
Or die sad and I'd hate that!
You know, I couldn't put up with that, I mean
You're better off being happy.
You're 
Yeah.
happy on the outside it  and you show you're happy on the outside you'll invariably be happy on the inside.
And it's that where it counts.
Yeah.
And I  I like being happy.
I mean
