Good gracious.
I bet he could have got it cheaper if he'd have waited.
Well he was the one who said they're two ninety nine and one ninety nine.
Yeah well only cos Matthew told him they were.
No, I don't think they're as cheap as that.
You'll have to write that one down June and tell mum.
In case what ?in case  Tam wants to get him something.
I was saying  big  I think.
Bloody peerage for him.
And he said that er he's had a do with erm  Joycie.
Sold her 
As what?
Well he's sold her  a set of patio doors  and told them they'd be sort of six to eight weeks delivery.
Meanwhile Mo smashes out the hole in the corner of the house sort of thing where they're gonna go and  they ain't there.
He said and I told you he said six to eight weeks he said.
Why smash the hole in the corner of your house?
Cos she was on the phone crying that er  she's got a hole in the side of her house  sort of thing .
Well I should think she has.
It's cold 
What in Morris in their own home?
I assume that's where she means.
Well yeah.
Yeah.
Well silly old fool .
Well that's like her.
She wouldn't take no notice.
Oh and erm  he reckon that he's, he's had a big do with erm 
Pat??
Brian.
Yeah.
Brian, no yeah Brian.
He said er  we had a big hoo hah he said er  I borrowed some money off him he said some time ago to do something with  and I hadn't got the money he said and when I sold the plot of land he said I paid him back what I owed him cos  borrow the money.
He said now he's telling everybody he said that er  I ain't ever paid him and I still owe him the money.
I wouldn't be surprised if he does.
So I said no   
Let's face it Geoff  he ain't paid you.
No.
Do you know he rang twice last 
Twenty nine thousand he reckons he sold that plot for.
Geoff had to get up and down last night to pick him up.
He had the bloody gall to 
I had to get out of bed.
ring me today and say that's got diarrhoea, he'll keep the car today but he don't want it tomorrow  can you find someone else who wants it.
I was asleep in bed.
I had to get up a 
I said that's the last time.
I felt terrible last night.
I said to June I can hardly see I've got that bad a headache.
So I went to bed  and I had to get up and get dressed and go and pick him up 
Go and pick him up.
and I was like this driving along the road.
Terrible.
Geoff said if I hadn't have wanted the money I wouldn't have bothered.
Well we ain't got paid anyway yet.
He said I can't pay you till Tuesday cos the money ain't come through for the work he said.
No I didn't th I should imagine, I thought he said you didn't, I would imagine he gets paid at the end of the month.
No.
What he said was you don't get paid until the erm  the actual sort of  whatever it is he's sold has  been installed.
So if somebody says I'll have a set of double glazing doors or something  until they've actually been installed he then gets paid.
Well that ain't a very good firm is it really?
No.
But then I suppose they don't get paid until the people  
But I mean what I couldn't understand was if he's selling all this stuff and
Where's mum's little black bag Jonathan?
making so much money I can't understand why 
What little black bag?
he's that destitute that he
My bag.
I don't know.
he more or less sort of said well I'll have to have a cheaper car.
Said well I don't do a cheaper car than that.
And he's specially asked down to Dover to do his karate thing or something.
Karate?
Well he was saying I do karate.
Is he still as big?
Well to tell you the truth I didn't really see him cos it was dark when he got in the car.
Cos he got ever so big didn't he?
I've lost my handbag anybody.
I don't want to leave it in the car.
You went upstairs.
Oh well perhaps I left it up   I'll take these up while I'm .

I say he looks like a cat.
He's meant to be a skunk.
Oh.

They're not.
You didn't see that cat thing last night again did you.
Cor it was ever so 
Oh we see the end of it.

You would?
Yeah I would.
Well I mean I can always collect it Thursday night.
Ooh that smell of like cat is awful in here.
Well I hate to tell you but this is  that's  the same smell that Dorothy's house has.
Keep thinking that's on that cushion.
That ain't.
That's near that washing machine.
I shall have to have the washing machine out.
Well I noticed it soon as I got to there.
In the middle of the room.
No
I noticed it straight away.
Cor!
That is definitely in that corner.
I noticed it when mum told me.
Well I told you  you'll have to get some of that stuff that you put in cat's litter trays to neutralize the smell.
Here you are.
This is what I always 
No that won't do it June.
That will do it.
I know 
Well put it in a bowl though.
No, I go like that.
Yeah but that ain't any good.
You've gotta get the stu the smell goes in to the liquid then you chuck the liquid away.
That's how you do that.
I stick a bit of that in.
Well that ain't doing anything.
That's the whole point.
Yeah but it is!
But she keeps doing it  she done it again last night, didn't smell till yesterday.
I told you to put some orange in there.
They don't like the smell of orange, she wouldn't go in there.
Mm.
Why is the kettle still on?
I'll put a can of that juice in.
The kettle's not on.
Ain't you got a fresh orange?
Yes it is.
Oh no it isn't.
You cut a fresh orange and lay it in there she wouldn't go in there cos they don't like  cats don't like the smell of orange.
Yeah?
If I eat an orange 
Well yeah but the only point is Susan  she perhaps don't like the smell of orange but then she might go in my room and pee in there if she didn't have nowhere else to go.
 
Well put  nights then.
I'll tell you what it is, that's since you've had that ginger cat she's done it.
She is frightened of that ginger cat Susan.

Oh it ain't getting very warm in here yet is it?
We'll go and sit in the room soon 
Bloody cold.
if it gets warmer in there.
I meant to tell you 
I don't know about you but once I pick these Mills and Boone books up I can't stop reading the flipping things.
No I'm like that.
Right, let's tidy up a bit Jonathan I 
Well no I you don't, I tell you what, after reading these I swear I could write one myself.
I swear I could.
Yeah when I get my printer mum said  I could write a book.
I'm gonna write a book.
I'm gonna write children's stories.
Oh my god.
When you was little I used to make up stories for him didn't I June?
Yeah.
 
And your mum used to say cor I wish I could write that down  but you, but I could never remember .
We never did did we?
We never did.
I do at school.
We have  I did one really good story.
It was called Professor Plop and the Timemachine.
You made it up?
Yeah.
We had to do a story when something unusual happened.
Oh, and what did Professor Plop do?
Professor Plop and the Timemachine, he made a timemachine, went to Egypt  and instead of having  Tuten Khamoun in headdress he had Tuten Khamoun in headphones.
Oh.
That looks a bit tidier don't it?
You could get a video, video erm  Don't keep doing it silly!
He's hurt his shoulder.
He
Well he will do if he  that.
Well leaning on it like that it's putting pressure on it.
Well the they said there was dead cats and dogs and things.
Yeah the carcasses, and they was in  some of them was just sort of like died there  and that was it, it was just there, and it rotted away and there was all 
Yeah but how did QQ 
Two or three carcasses of animals in, in a plastic bag and it said they was just literally matted together.
And the stench was out of this world.
Well I should think it was full of maggots.
That's what the bloke said.
There was thousands he said, from the R S P C A, was thousands of maggots  and there was a little kitten  erm guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbit 
What all dead?
No, these was alive and they  got all them.
But they just said all over the garden there was just dead carcasses of animals.
And as they just died there it was just left there.
And this woman  neighbour, I mean she looked  very respectable.
Well how the hell did they find out about it then?
Well it was something to do with  the little boy.
And they said something about  this woman  a neighbour said oh  where the hell's Jimmy or something today?
So she said oh  he's alright.
And then  he just never went to school  and they maintained they'd got a private .
And so she said,thi this neighbour said well just how  nosy can you get?
You know she said I just said to her oh how's Jimmy sort of thing  and she said he's alright.
Yeah but was she a woman living on her own or had she got a husband?
As far as I know she was living on her own with this little old boy.
So apparently he'd never been to school?
He had been to school originally  because that's what she said he, then he didn't go to school and that's why she said you know, how is he and she said 
Yeah well I thought they said in one of the papers that he'd never been registered anywhere.
That's right.
Well that that was the whole thing.
So he couldn't have gone to school could he?
No he, it was a bit peculiar, I couldn't quite make nothing  and they said something about  they kept him away from other children or something.
And the chap  sort of the head of social services or local government officer, he said well  in the nineteen nineties he said it is still possible, if you want to  to keep your children away from school.
You know it's it's as possible as it always has been.
But when when they showed you in the house  there was just like  old cardboard boxes just sort of thrown in the corner and  and  just sort of paper carrier bags and polythene bags just sort of slung there.
You've never seen nothing like it.
I mean it looked like the house had been derelict for  forty years.
But they was living amongst it.
Never seen nothing like it in me life.
And the stench must have been terrible.
Daddy.

Too much radiation, yeah.
I suppose you  you're gonna have a certain amount .
We shouldn't get any.
Shouldn't you?
No.
If there's a reading the machine's not right.

Cos you see if you get radiation, too much radiation you get cancer don't you?
Yeah, yeah quite.
I see that  Gary Linekar

Oh he was so emotional about it.
She is absolutely petrified of that cat.
Yeah?
Literally petrified.
Excuse me.
You got a cold?
Yeah.
Oh I'd have brought my  for you.
Yeah.
It doesn't seem to be getting very warm in here to me.
Central heating   That weren't even on when I looked at it.
Well it's only on about seventeen.
There you are.
That's why it ain't coming up.
What does yours do , do you have yours on normally?
Twenty  .
Twenty.
What do you have your boiler on?
Three and a half, four.
Depends what er  this time of year about three and a half and then four in the winter.
Well mum only had hers on one the other week.
That's why it was cold in there.
Oh yeah well it ain't, that's a different sort of thing to ours.
That's, that's  completely different.
Well they have theirs on one con continuously don't they?
Yeah.
See we don't have our heating on continuously.
No I don't.
Well theirs don't switch off does it?
It just carries on.
Different sort of thing.
Well mine, I use, I've got  
Well I was cold down mum's last Sunday.
I told her, I said to her it was 
Yeah.
cold down there.
Well I have mine on
Mind you, I'd rather be like that.
Yeah, than too hot.
Cor.
You can always put a sweater on can't you?
Oh yeah.
Mine I have on twenty and I have the boiler on  well either two or three really.
Yeah well I  two is just really for heating the water for us.
Oh no  one is heating the water for me.
One will heat my water.
Yeah.
Easy.
I mean two makes my water boiling.
Yeah.
I get real hot water you know
Yeah.
because you see I only use it  a tankful once a day when I have a bath in the morning  have a bath at night as well.
Yeah.
Yeah well there's three of us have baths.
There's three of you so, well I do a lot more washing than you don't I?
Mm.
And Jonathan lets the water out, and then fills it back up again.
When he, when he's in the bath he'll let water out and then 
Jonathan .
fills it up again with hot.
What?
Lets some out, fills it up again with hot.
Don't keep banging.
What's he do that for?
Cos he's a  pillock, that's why.
No other word for it.
And I say to him I don't know whether you realize that costs water  costs money to heat that water.
No.
They don't realize do they?
The on they only realize when they get bills of their own when they get older.
That ain't serious the one who's got er Led Zeppelin coming to her house.
Why?
Well I can't see her living on five pound a week can you?
She does at the moment.
And her mother does all the  all the washing for the  when she us does hairdressing does all the washing, all them towels, hangs them out.
Buys this, buys that.
She uses her mother's electric.
Telephone .
Telephone.
Has her money in her pocket.
She's  well don't she give her mother any  
Mind you Val said  I can't help her out sort of financially cos she hasn't got it, but she said I can he , I said well you do help her out financially .
Well yeah in that way.
Quite.
I said in that way.
She said well I can't give her any money cos I haven't got any.
Do you know a lot of them girls at work pay twenty five and thirty pound a week board?
Yeah so I mean really  the twenty five pound a week she's not paying her mother she could go to pay a mortgage.
It's a hundred pound a month innit?
Well Sue was Sue erm over the road was telling me  erm  the money her boys give is a hundred pound a month.
What's that?
Twenty five pound a week.
Twenty five pound a week.
So that's two hundred pound a month for two of them.
She said she never touches that money.
She banks it.
Yeah?
What, for the boys?
No  for herself!
Two hundred pound a month!
Well no, she gets fifteen off one and twenty off the other.
That's still thirty five pound a week.
Well that's thirty five pound a week.
Yeah.
That's a hundred and forty pound a month.
That's a hundred and forty pound a 
And she banks that, she never touches that.
So twelve months that's twelve 
And the way she talks you'd think she's destitute wouldn't you?
Well that's why she don't need to go to work innit?
Course it is.
Well I couldn't live off my son like that.
Too true.
Well I'd rather give to  if I had any children I'd have give to them.
Mind you she is, let's fa she does help that youngest one out.
She is helping him out cos he ain't got a job.
Well yeah.
So  you know she she said he gets it back in the long run.
What a useless fairy he was.
Who?
Oh she said he absolutely loves Tesco's.
She said he's hoping they're gonna give him full employment.
What's he got a temporary job then?
Yeah.
He loves Tesco's.
I don't like shopping in there, let alone working in there..
God!
Well that kid he  
Well I've done that job stacking shelves.
That's a 
that 
and you, it was alright, and guess what he stacked the first day he was there?
What?
Turkey!
Did he really?
Yeah!
She said he said er I couldn't believe it but she said he didn't mind cos it was all frozen.
So she said weren't it marvellous.
God.
What, did he come from Turner's Turkeys then or something?
Yeah, he 
Well  worked with Geoff at Turner's Turkeys he lasted three days.
Well Ken he actually worked with.
He went to work with Ken and  he he lasted three days.
He didn't li 
Why was that?
Well he didn't like working with the meat.
Then he was off sick.
And then he got a job in Tesco's and  stacked turkeys ?
Yeah.
But he was completely er  this old boy come down to me so he said that old boy's left.
I said no he isn't I said, he's off sick.
He said I think he's left.
I said I know he hasn't left because I say his his wife works with my wife and he's off sick.
He said well he's bloody useless.
His wife?
His mother!
Sorry, I meant meant to say his mother, yeah I said his his mother I said.
I didn't say his wife.
Works with my wife.
So he said well he's bloody useless.
He said erm  they sent him down there he said and they said  go there, I forget his name this 
Duane.
No I mean this old boy's name.
Mark I think his name is.
My god Duane!
He's a right twit.
Yeah.
So he said they said to him well go with Mark and he'll show you the  what to do.
And all he'd gotta do was just put like  two different bins, sizes of turkeys, and they just pick them out and there's this thing like a V shaped hook and they just sort of 
Hook it on .
hook er  I don't know what part they hook up there  but they just hook it straight on this thing.
And that's all they do all day long.
Just pick them up 
Ooh what a boring job.
and go like that.
But it's if they're tall 
That's what I thought.
if they're tall it's an easy job.
But if they ain't tall  and you've gotta reach every time, that's bloody hard work.
Well I know that cos they're heavy old turkeys.
And that's cold in there it's a terrible cold.
Well  wouldn't do very much well at that  cos  too short.
tall enough?
Well he was doing  this old boy was doing nine to his one.
So I said well how could you do nine to his one?
He said well he used to go  and he'd sort of look up at it, and he'd sort of think about how he was gonna put it in there he said then he'd be going like this  then he'd sort of get hold of the other hand he said and he'd put it in like that  and these other old boys are going like this  with full hands you know?
He said he's pathetic.
So I said to his boss, like Ken's boss, Tony  I said how are you getting on with your counting?
Cor dear oh dear he said, I know I well know why he's down here doing that.
So I said is he any good at it?
He said I don't think that boy'd be any good at anything.
So  he said I can honestly say he said  I think he's one of the worst I've ever had down there.
So Ken said to him  I can't understand what a boy like you's doing here Duane.
He told Sue didn't he?
Mm.
So, but I, I think he thought Ken meant that he was like superior and he didn't ought to be doing that sort of job.
You know, he ought to be doing better things.
And Les said he'd be sitting here  I'd say  Duane ooh ooh should I be working  he'd say .
He said he was always on another planet.
He said he was sort of just miles away, sit there he was you know looking out to space and I'd say Duane  ooh should I be working he'd say.
Funny though how people are like that.
Oh dear.
What was that thing come through from Les this morning?
Just a bill for that  I R N  B thing, whatever.
What is that?
Do you think you'll get some tax back Geoff?
I'm gonna get it all back, yeah.
Erm what it is it's er
How much will you get back then?
Erm  so far this year I've paid  nearly, not quite twelve hundred quid.
Oh so you might get some of that back?
I should get all of it back.
And then I shouldn't pay tax 
When should you get it though?
I would think
In the next few weeks?
I  well see, he's put the books in.
Depending how quick they actually okay them  erm I mean  for two years, three years now they they've just gone straight through with no queries at all.
That might be my luck this year that'll be the bloody year they give me a query.
But if they go straight through, well then that'll go through to  the Spalding tax office.
Then that'll go through to Turners so I mean  it could be like a fortnight after they've been okayed.
Mm.
Let's hope it does then.
Well that'll be just right for  thingme for christmas then, some more money.
Yeah.
But then if it goes on 
He wants you to ring him you know.
Ring him Geoff because of 
Well I can ring him Monday can't I?
Yeah.
Well that's what I thought myself after you'd been there ring him then.
Yeah.
What you hoping then that the building society are gonna lend you the money so you can pay your bank draft off?
Yeah you see what I want to do  the arrears that I've got with him 
Got to pay off.
and and the erm  the bank  loan  the mortgage would then pay  the mortgage I've got.
The new mortgage would pay most of what I am  in arrears with him you see so, which would keep him happy.
In arrears with who?
With the finance bloke.
The one who want the money last week.
So how much do you want to borrow then?
Just enough to pay him off?
Thirty  at the end of the day I want a mortgage of about thirty five grand to pay the bank, pay him and also the mortgage that we've already got.
Like that would then pay that off and  have another mortgage.
Restart  sort of remortgage.
Yeah.
Cos you got  what they said was 
Which isn't exceptional in this day and age anyway.
She says erm 
How much were the repayments on that thing?
Erm  at the moment my mortgage is eighty four.
What a month?
Yeah.
That's that's my  own mortgage.
The bank  I pay  cos there's two or three different things I have to pay to the bank which they insist if you have a development loan you have to have this and you have to have that and that comes 
The worst thing we ever did.
Yeah but you see 
Yeah it comes to about four hundred and thirty five pound a month.
What's that for?
The the the well the equivalent of the overdraft.
 
But you see you have an over you have the loan.
But they then insist you take out this insurance so if you're off sick 
No not yet.
that's automatically paid.
So there wouldn't be so much going out actually?
No.
No.
Well no because Geoff bought if Geoff pays his cars off he won't have to pay them off per month.
No.
No he's not gonna pay them off.
He's paying what he ow got behind.
No that's what I'm say I'll tell you in a minute when I've finished this.
Oh I see.
He's got behind  
Yeah but then he'll, we should be able to manage then  to pay the mortgage and pay them and keep on the level peg.
See what he what I pay at the moment is eighty four pound for the house.
And it's about four hundred and  about four hundred and twenty, four hundred and thirty pound to the bank.
So I mean you you're talking five hundred pound aren't you?
Yeah.
Five hundred pound.
Erm but that's not taking into consideration the arrears on the vehicles.
But, the other way  if they say yes you can have the mortgage, it works out about three hundred and sixty pound a month.
Then there'll be nothing going to the bank and it also would pay off the arrears on  on the vehicles.
So I'm paying like a hundred and twenty pound a month less but it's 
Yeah and you wouldn't get all those bank charges.
That's right.
That's right.
So we're paying 
Then of course all the money that you were paying, won't be paying in bank charges you'll be paying off.. your debt?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right
Yeah.
Well blow me.
Well you might as well try and 
The amount my ordinary bank charges forgetting any sort of bank loan, nothing like that at all, interest, nothing like that, just bank charges for standing orders to the finance company  er are something like  sixteen seventeen hundred pound a year.
Well really you don't want that.
You might as well go and pay them cash.
Well that's what I've said.
Well that's what he's said.
He'll p , all he, all the money we get we'll just put into the building society  and pay the bills from the building society.
Pay it once a month.
Geoff can go
Will they allow you to do that?
They're ha quite happy to do it once a month but like you said what they will not do  erm obviously is to have a lot of sort of things like standing orders and that sort of thing.
They don't wanna know about that.
Well no well  if you get an understanding with the people  
Yeah but you don't want to do standing orders then do you?
Well Les was saying the only thing you've gotta be careful of  like when you pay money into a bank  when you're in business and you pay money into the bank and the bank then pay your standing orders  er and everything's done through a bank, then the tax office sort of tend to think well fair enough you know, he's legit.
But he said when you start paying money just into a building society  and then lump sum this and lump sum that  they tend to sort of then  oh you know, what is actually going on here and they tend to start looking about a bit more.
Well then when they start looking about a bit more, that is when it costs you because  anything that Les has to get involved in, cos they go back to Les and say well why did he do this and why did you do that?
Then it costs you.
Well I should ima would imagine he'd just say well in this day and age the banks are just charging him so much he just finds 
Mummy  can I watch T V please?
this is an easier way.
Oh yeah but I mean  no I I don't mean in general, I mean specific things.
They'll say well why did this cheque do so and so and why did this do so and so  and like he said well when you're talking about forty eight pound an hour  you don't want me poking round there trying to sort out the tax man  
Yeah but even so if you paid him forty eight pounds for an hour  that's still 
Yeah but if you  if you  
ain't as much as what the bank would charge you.
Oh no but I mean  it wouldn't be 
Yeah but Geoff if you keep a record when you took money in  when you draw it out.
We'll keep a complete record of it.
Oh no no no you ain't  you you ain't caught  what I mean 
Yeah but then if he had to find anything then  
Yeah but, no but you think how many yeah but you think how many entries go in my book  during the course of a normal year.
So then if suddenly I have about a tenth of them entries.
They're gonna want to know why.
Exactly.
There ain't the detail that there has been 
Yeah but then 
over the years.
And that's what they wanna know.
yeah but yeah but then on the other hand, let's face it  our business 
Mum.
has fluctuated.
That's been on a real high and then gone down to a low to nothing.
Yeah.
So you don't get many names in that book anyway.
And that is how it has been.
Oh no, no I don't, no I don't mean no I don't mean  I don't mean the business going here, I mean the things that I pay.
I mean everything I have to detail down down to what payments I make  and what costs I have  everything is all detailed down isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well then if you're just paying that money into a building society  and you're paying, obviously  you can't write out as many cheques as what you would normally d do in a bank and have a standing order so therefore it's gotta be paid by cash.
Yeah?
Well that's that's when the tax man starts getting fishy and you've got to know 
Yeah but what 
Well I mean what difference does it, what difference does it make?
Yeah but if you do it above board I can't see
Well it's just that the cash is  ah no, that's what I'm saying.
But they, you gotta have  I mean I could say oh I paid erm  what shall I say erm off the top of my head, what can I think?
What I pay.
Cory oil?
Mummy.
Well that's a little bit different again.
Yeah but I can't see how they can say anything as long as you've got a legitimate receipt for it.
as long as you've got all the receipts and everything.
I can't
No well that's what I'm saying.
Yeah but you see that's  if it's cash every time, that's when they start wanting to be fishy about it.
And they then say well right, cos  every time an accountant does your books at the front of your, the actual like er  the booklet what you get on your accounts it says at the front  something like these accounts have  erm  have been audited  but only erm  we have taken the word of Mr  that what he said is right.
I mean they ain't sort of I mean what they could force you to do if they really, I mean they would never do that but what they could force you to do  or Les to do  would be to check with all those people who I've actually sort of made payments to, to make sure that I have.
See that you have done.
So I could write out a cheque saying  paid Carl  sixty pounds for doing my car.
And I could actually give you, I mean I've all I've got is a cheque stub.
There is nothing what actually says, only when that cheque goes back to the bank, there's nothing anywhere apart from the bank  who says that cheque is actually made out to.
I could put on that cheque's to
Well how do you go on then?
Well that's what I'm saying.
They  Les takes my word for it.
So they in turn take Les's word for it.
But if they wanted to 
Yeah but on the 
they could say right 
yeah but on the other hand Geoff if they took that attitude with everybody, nobody would 
Ah no well that's it.
Well that's what they do, but he was saying, about once every fifteen years that's what they do.
They'll wait till something goes a bit funny in your accounts then they'll say right, we want to do this.
Now if you remember, the the first year 
Well why don't you just prewarn them before you're gonna do it and say look I'm no longer gonna use this bank I'm er
Mummy when you come back in can I put  
Well no I mean  no I mean it's just something they can do.
Yeah alright Jonathan 
And they, you know
Well I think that's bloody  
Well wh the first year we went in business we had that
Jonathan.
the very first year we was in business.
And Les said I can't believe this he said, I  he said if you'd have been in business ten years  that I could understand but he said to do it your first 
Geoff.
Yeah?
Well what, perhaps you've had your turn then.
there's Joe.
For you.
Oh yeah.

No,.

Oh so I was telling you  erm 
Oh yeah.
And  so Pam just said to her  yeah she said he is married to my ex  she is married to my ex husband but she said  she's bloody welcome to him.
You know?
And what these girls must have said she don't know.
And Bobby picked up the phone when the phone rang and it was her  and she sai erm Bob said yes?
And he spoke to her, said hello so she said  oh hello Bob she said, is Pam there?
And of course Bob went and got Pam.
Cor she was right abusive to Pam.
She told Pam to keep out the shop.
It ain't her bloody shop anyway.
Yeah but you do, you only 
Yeah but I don't know you see, so
Well now would them girl would them girls say, she must have said more than that mother.
You know what she's like.
So erm er she said she was quite rude she said and I rang back she said, I was gonna tell her  and she stamped the phone down.
She said I rang back  and  her husband answered it.
He said eff  effing well get off the phone so 
Well she does cause a lot of 
Well I mean really I mean 
Well why the hell does she
That's what Vi said  her mother he said 
I mean really and truly mum with all these shops that are about, why has she gotta go in that one?
She sai and Bobby said oh  he said if they  
Which  shop does she work in?
 McKay's Next to Bewise innit in town.
Yeah but why 
Well I wouldn't have thought she'd have gone in a shop like that anyway cos there's some more expensive stuff in there.
No, there's some good stuff in there cheap.
It's fairly cheap in there.
And what I've seen what she's had.
Yeah but
But anyway erm Bobby said I don't know why you worry about it, he said.
Let, I said well the best thing ju to do erm  er  Pam I said is just to ignore them I said and ignoring them makes it  you know?
See I know why cos you see her husband  he don't and  cos when her husband come for the kids Bob was there and he said I ain't bloody well going out to them.
He just was in there doing something  the children went out and he said I said to him good morning, he said good morning.
He said and I just  don't take no notice of him.
But you see she  erm Julie's a bit upset over things cos she said  that er  they've gotta sell the house and they've gotta sell the car.
Cos he's  in a bit of problems I suppose.
Although he's got a good job so Pam said I don't know why he's got in that  problem.
But I said well your best thing to do Pam I said is forget it.
I said he's not your husband any more.
I said and avoid her as much as possible I said if you both clash together.
I said but she can't keep you out the shop anyway.
So she said I've a good mind to write to the manager so Bobby said you wanna leave well alone, forget he said.
Well no be because the manager perhaps has heard 
Would give her the sack.
how she speaks  no  he, he might ban her from the shop if she, if she keeps  Well you know she's called her all sorts of things in front of people.
Well you don't do that.
Oh yeah, yeah.
And Bobby didn't wanna know.
He said I just speak to him he said when I see him and  they're nice to me and I'm nice to them.
Yeah but the whole point is 
He said he only wants to put himself   
I mean she's always saying she's always saying how  you know she, oh my kids this, my kids that.
Well if that woman loses her job through what Pam has said she's not gonna be very nice to her children is she?
Mm.
He makes her  he makes her  oh he said to the children you can go in the house with your dirty boots.
So Bobby said they said oh dad said we can come in the house.
Bob said you  you do what we tell you not what he tells you.
You take your bo boots off outside if they're muddy.
You don't bring it in the house.
And that Stephanie cos she don't  she don't like him she never ha well she don't know much about him do she?
She was only four weeks old when he left.
Yeah?
So  she said oh he's a nuisance she say.
He makes me sweep up after I've had me tea.
What, the two er eldest have to wash up and she has to sweep up round the table .
And he's telling them they can go in Pam's house 
Yeah.
with dirty boots on?
That's what Bobby said.
They don't like going really do they?
No .
He said specially the boy, he's getting  he said he, the boy's getting shown now  well she said herself  that he don't like me  to hear me  arguing and swearing.
Well I should think not.
He said to her oh forget it mother he said  keep on.
And Bobby said he's getting that age where he don't like to hear it.
But he said I think 
Well Paul don't like  never used to like it.
No, he said I think before long he'll just  you know, not  go there.
And the little'un couldn't care less but the middle one thinks a lot of her dad.
She's like him.
And Pam told us yesterday  that she can't kiss her on the lips.
Kiss who?
Her little girl.
. She said when she comes to kiss me good  goodnight I let her kiss here but  she said  I can't have her cuddling me or she said I think of  him all the time.
Cos she's so much like him.
Well that ain't her fault.
Well it ain't the child's fault.
No.
How cruel!
She said  and Bobby says she don't  he said I was laying on the floor the other night and she came down beside with me and put her arm  round me as we were laying there he said I'll never  do anything he said cos if you  started playing about with her she'll, you know  childlike and  and he said she wouldn't erm show her affection any more.
He said you've got to  take that child gradually that one.
But he said the other one's a cheeky little bugger he said really.
He said and I'd soon tell her off.
He said but I sit at night he said when she's gone to work and he said and help them  with their drawings and things they're doing.

Yeah but he did go out with a girl there for a while didn't he?
In London.
Well he's been married twice wasn't he?
He was  
Has he?
Oh yeah.
Brian has, yeah.
He he divorced his second wife cos she thought more of anim animals.
But I think it was because er she couldn't have children you see?
Yeah?
That's why he packed up.
Well he's got enough of his own anyway by the sound of it.
He used to live at Picken Pickerham didn't he?
Somewhere outside sort of Swaffham.
Pick Pickering something, yeah.
They reckon she was 
North oh yeah North and South Pickenham.
yeah that's where yeah.
Yeah.

He's frightened.
Doesn't he like fooling about?
He keeps getting in 
No.
nanny's sink.
 
No erm Fuji Juji she'll play with you, look.

She's asleep.
Get your cards and play with them.
 
We ain't got some.
There's some er in the drawer.
Pick them  
They ain't all in there.
They've all gotta sorted out  sort them out.
Yeah so it sounds as, he's got a lot of skeletons in his cupboard.
Yeah.
Yes.
Then he had the cheek to tell me Joey erm  Joey  had a lot of skeletons in his.
I thought well I dunno who's got the worst out of them two .
Yeah.
No neither do I.
At least I don't think Joey's got any children.
I think we could write a book about our family, what goes on with  someone ha going out with someone else and  blimey!
I feel a bit boring compared to everybody else .
So do I.
Yeah.
Bugger me, they've had some fun.
Haven't they just .
Sounds like it.
Yeah well they all seem to be bloody happy though don't they?
The tragedy of it is though he's paying for it now with his kidney problems.
Yeah.
Well that ain't got nothing to do with his kidney problems.
You don't know what disease he picked up  
You don't know what he's what
Well he didn't.
You know what caused his kidney problem in the first place.
He's always had high blood pressure and never had it treated.
Oh.
And what it does, it eventually it breaks down your kidneys.
Oh.
What, he knew he had it?
No he didn't know he had high blood pressure.
And it wasn't just  it was by pure coincidence, I mean his kidneys would have stopped anyway, that bloke thumped him in the pub.
Yeah?
Accid you know, came up behind him and thought he 
Yeah.
mistook him for somebody else and thumped him and knocked 
Yeah.
nearly knocked him unconscious.
And he had, kept getting bad, and he'd had bad heads oh for years  but he just thought that was, he was one of them people that got bad heads.
And he went to the doctor  and the doctor said well you haven't got anything wrong with your skull but I'll take your blood pressure.
He took his blood pressure and he said well this is astronomically high.
He said erm I shall ha I'll have to send you up the hospital and you'll have to have a  you know
Scan, didn't he?
He had a scan.
scan and that.
So he went up and had a scan and they s they checked it and of course when they checked the scan they noticed that his kid one of his kidneys hadn't been functioning for a long time.
One of them was useless.
Mm.
And they said that  that erm  he'd got to erm  what did he say?
He'd gotta have these tests for this other kidney.
Yeah.
Erm  when they tested it they said that one was near to failure anyway and that was what was, been causing his bad heads and it was just by pure coincidence  that bloke hitting him, that brought it to light.
Yeah.
Otherwise he was, kidneys  he would have just collapsed.
Yeah but he ain't rejected this kidney he's had has he?
Well he's on steroids.
He's having a lot of problems isn't he?
He's on steroids.
He he can't, never come off steroids.
Is he still fat?
Cor he looks  
Well he's saying that that bloke mistook him for somebody else then?
Is that what 
Yeah.
Well he didn't.
He didn't 
I can assure you I kn he knew exactly who he was.
Oh.
Yeah that that chap at the 
You see what happened was he nearly knocked his kids over.
He cut him up or something didn't he?
He come flying round that bend near mums and nearly  his kids were on the side of the road and he come through there
Oh.
and he knew who it was see cos he goes up the pub same as he does.
And th obviously there aren't that many American cars around.
So he was waiting for him?
And that's why he went to the toilet without  
Yeah but apparently apparently that weren't hi his Am that was his American car that nearly hit them but th Brian had sold that to a bloke down in  down your mum's road.
Yeah?
Down your road.
That's why he thought it was Brian.
Oh .
Eh?
A Alan ?
Yeah that was him!
Yeah?
That weren't Brian.
 
Cos  Brian had sold the car to him.
Yeah?
Because  he said the bloke
Yeah.
thought that was him in the car but it wasn't cos 
Oh I know what you mean yeah.
he'd got the silver one hadn't he, then?
Oh.
He sold the blue one
Yeah?
He said, yeah 
the blue one 
that's right he's still got it the bloke has, yeah.
Yeah well that was  that was him.
Was it?
That wasn't  Brian .
Pity he didn't hit him  cos he's a big man.
Well cos he went to po he thumped Brian.
Didn't even look at him, thumped him from behind you see?
Hit him 
Yeah.
straight in the back.
Yeah.
Course he fell and hit his head on the washbasin.
Yeah?
It's surprising thumping him in the back didn't kill him with the kidney failure innit?
Mm yeah.
Well I suppose that's what made him go unconscious really.
Yeah.
Did they have the ambulance and that?
Well no he went out but they  somebody ran in there and h well  B Brian and  I think Pat and  David were having a drink with him and I think they suddenly thought well he's been in there a long time.
Yeah.
So Pat said go and see what he's doing.
And they found him on the floor?
Yeah.
Well he was on the floor weren't he?
Ju just about coming round.
easily have been  
But that that bloke, that bloke he'll thump anybody won't he Geoff?
Oh yeah,.
Was it  was it?
Yeah.
Mm.
He used to carry on with that 
I always call him Else.
Yeah.
carry on with that girl up the road there didn't he?
Who, Jasmine ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She comes to the dentist she does.
What's she like now?
Exactly the same.
Cor!
What a fire engine.
Is she married?
 
Yeah.
But she's got a good job.
Very clever girl.
Very bright her.
Believe it or not.
Do you think that, that one was better than the other one, number Three?
Yeah that was a good one, number Two weren't it?
I like number Three better.
Although I didn't watch that one, it's so  innit?
I shall have to watch number Three cos I ain't seen number Three.
That's the one I haven't seen.
I've seen that one.
You have?
What?
Number Two.
I don't think he made any more after Three.
 
He went into something else didn't he?
I said to June yeah.
Yeah.
I said to June that's gonna be a bloody great house opposite us.
Yeah so she said.
Yeah I was telling mum.
me!
When I see it!
I said we could get get our house inside it.
Cor and the rest.
Twice.
Don't want a big house  
I bet the house itself is as big as .
Perhaps they've got something else in mind Geoff.
Perhaps they're gonna have guests or something.
No.
He just says  I mean he was saying to June  
Well believe it or not that tells you how people are lucky.
They've bui got out a new  what is it?
Roof tile.
A new roof tile.
And this firm  he thinks because he's gonna have his roof done with these roof tiles, these new type  they're gonna give him them!
They're looking for one sort of nice house to sort of show them more or less.
It's in the 
To show them.
the Ideal Homes Exhibition this year.
And they're looking for a nice house to put them on.
And he's gonna get his house re-roo 
They're gonna give them to him.
all roofed for nothing.
Cor, lovely.
Cor.
I said my god!
Cor!
Money goes to money.
What is he giving up the farm then?
No.
Well no.
No?
No, what he was saying was  see he sold his house for  two hundred and thirty thousand I think he said.
Cor.
But what he said was that erm  the house wanted a lot of money spending on it and he couldn't afford to do it.
Don't  put that on there Jonathan.
It don't play.
And the farm has, last three years has lost a lot of money  and er they had one farm at  Colkirk which they've now sold  and er  they just sort of decided they wanted to make the, they had a big barn, a big white barn which was a real old barn  and he wanted to make that into a house.
And er  the planning people said no, we won't let you do that  but you can knock the barn down
And build
and build a house on there.
But the stupid thing is it ain't where the barn was is it?
No, it's further round  
Further over.
So he's now knocked the barn down and he's  erm  gonna have this new house built and 
So he could have left the barn where it was?
Well that's right.
Yeah.
Mind you I suppose it would have been close to the house.
Yeah, yah.
So that's now give him more garden space sort of thing.
But he said they've just  I mean this year the whole orchard.
That 
And he's gonna all them 
complete orchard opposite us they never picked one, that's a plum orchard and they ne never picked one single plum.
Oh yeah because you got a lot didn't you?
They did.
Cos they, they didn't Jonathan cos he said we can't sell them.
Yeah but he never picked an we did.
Nobody wants them.
We picked them.
And that's why he said you can go and pick as many plums as you like cos we just haven't  
He never sold any of them .
 
it's common market innit?
Never sold a plum at all.
He was saying what happened was the last three years there's been no plums about so the supermarkets have sort of found something else.
Now there is plums  they don't want them.
Don't want them.
Yeah but he was s that was him who was saying  they use a lot of plums and puree stuff in babyfood.
But now they're not using plums any more, they're using marrow.
They use marrow cos it's cheaper.
Cos it's cheaper.
Yeah, oh yeah.
So that's what they use.
So, well you imagine what go into bloody babyfoods?
Yuk.
Well marrows are good for babies.
I'll tell you what
That's all water and starch isn't it?
you buy some 
Yeah.
you buy jam today, it don't last very long.
That goes mildewed.
Goes off.
No it goes moul goes mouldy 
Do you know why?
very quick.
Yeah.
Cos they're not allowed to put the preservatives in it any more.
Oh you know that bit of cheese  we got from Superkey?
Yeah.
That  mum said she cu definitely cut it off.
What you mean?
Cos we thought it was a bit what they had pre-wrapped ?
But it was mouldy!
Yeah.
But she said she definitely cut it off while she waited.
Geoff's mum got me a piece of cheese last week from Superkeys.
On the Friday that was wasn't it?
On the Friday.
I opened it on Saturday and it was mouldy.
It was mouldy.
 
Well you should have rung them up.
Well that's naughty that is.
Isn't it mum?
You should have rung them up.
Well I thought perhaps it was a bit what was wrapped up  
Wrapped up and we thought that had perhaps been 
But mum said no.
Definitely not.
She cut it off.
Well their Rose, she got a bit on the  once when she went up there and she come over here she said to us would we  take it up and change .
She never noticed it when she was in there and when she turned it over  that was all green, all the way round.
Yeah?
But they changed it.
Yeah?
Oh yeah cos he said he'd
Got to press record and play.
I did press it.
You didn't.
Perhaps I didn't press it hard enough.
That's gotta click in, yeah.
Ah, did you press them at the same time?
Are you supposed to press them at the same time?
I dunno.
Yes.

New one's starting next week.
I read them, I've read the books some of the Ruth Rendell books.
Yeah.
Oh if I was me and I was on my own I'd ha I'd have to have the telly in the bedroom.
Well how can I get it in me bedroom?
I ain't got an aerial in there.
Get one then.
I tell you what I'd like to do in Jonathan's.
You know he's got his telly standing on that dressing table?
What I want, you can bu 
portable innit?
Yeah but
You can buy a little thing
June's portable aerial works alright.
My portable aerial works lovely.
Used to have it in his bedroom.
Well in fact  
What I want to do 
What do you do then, with it?
Just plug it in the mains?
Course you do.
There's  yeah, you you plug  the electric plug you plug in the mains.
Yeah?
And the other aerial is just  plugged in the back where the aerial goes.
There's a little tiny plug and  that works off that aerial okay.
Well I have got a plug and lead hanging out.
Do you just switch that into the aerial socket?
Yeah.
Put that in where the aerial goes.
Yeah.
Oh well I could have a look at that then.
And then you have to what you'll have to do  erm  don't bother to change the telly for the moment.
Just get hold of the aerial and just sort of twist it round and see if you can a good enough picture.
If you can't 
Well I'll get a lo well 
well then you'll have to set up again with your  controls.
that telly was mine but  I've got a lovely picture when I used to have it in the kitchen.
I used to sit there 
What, without having it sort of with an aerial?
Yeah.
No aerial.
Yeah.
Oh well I didn't think I could do that without
That was a nice telly that.
The only time you don't get a very good p if the atmospherics is a bit haywire.
Yeah.
And if that's a damp night or something  
Yeah.
That goes a bit haywire then.
I'll have to try it and see how I get on.
Yeah well what I want for Jonathan's bedroom, you can buy them.
You put them in the  sort of the corner, Mr  's got one, you extend your telly.
Yeah.
Yeah well one of them'd be handy for Jonathan's bedroom
Yeah but not too high.
No, not too high 
Who's bedroom?
Yeah to put that portable telly on  and then he's got all the space on the top for his computer.
Can I pinch his pen for a minute?
Cos there ain't a lot of space for the  is there?
Hey mum!
There is one thing I thought of.
You know I can't find anywhere to put my joysticks and my  light guns.
Could we put some little holders underneath that little  square bit?
 
Well yeah we could  I tell you what 
Makes a lot, the  from there.
we could put on.
What?
We could put under there to hang some bits and pieces up, some of them little sticker things.
Then you can hang some up under
What sticker things?
Sticker things?
Like mum's got her tea towels on.
Or  put some  well I don't wanna start drilling holes in it.
No.
You don't have to drill holes in it.
What do you wanna hang on it then?
What do you win?
The light gun.
Cos I haven't got nowhere to put it.
Drill holes in what June?

His dressing table.
Oh.
Oh.
You don't have to drill them though.
 
Yeah well mum's  yeah but you can get them 
You'd have to drill holes in the wall.
Well a desk.
You can get them little hooks like I hang my tea cloths on.
Some pretty little ones.
If you put it underneath the desk, a few of them.
And then the light gun could slot in that.
 
That's, have you ever tried a  stollen June?
Pardon?
They come off though.
That's like a christmas cake
A stollen?
Yeah.
With, with erm 
 
marzipan in, in the actual inside.

Got to make you go whoosh.
If I'd have thought about it, that wedding cake she give me
We could have took the icing off that.
If I'd have took that icing off  that cake was as moist as anything, I could have re-marzipanned that
Yeah.
and re-iced that for christmas.
Yeah but what about for me dinner?
 
But Geoff has eaten it.
 
Did you a favour there didn't she Geoff?
I I sent his
Yeah.
I sent his friend, cos his friend loves cherries
That cake's three year old.
Mm.
so I sent his friend bi when I cut it there's some bits got ever so many cherries in  so I sent his friend up with the cherries in.
Jonathan.
Don't keep going in them drawers.
And what did you do?
 
Aah!
I give him the cherries and ate the cake  myself .
Give him the cherries and ate the cake and then Geoff told him.
I said  I gotta tell you something.
He said what?
I said I gotta come clean with you.
He said what?
I said you know you've been having them cherries?
He said yeah.
I said well actually the cake was for you as well.
You thieving git  he said .
I said my wife has been giving me two and three bits every day thinking you're having one of them.
And Geoff was 
Bloody hell he said.
and Geoff was eating them.
So now every day he looks to make sure how many I got.
I shall put him a bit in tomorrow though.
What happened  that lump we had then?
He don't have no dinner.
His wife don't pack him up 
Well  
no dinner.
Oh.
had last week and I threw the other little bit out.
And he's a bloody great fat bloke and he sits here all day and 
He's huge!
has a cup of coffee for his dinner.
I said 
Didn't Della speak to you today then?
No.
No-one in mate, no.
What?
No.
She come downstairs  well not for the first half hour.
She came downstairs, she slopped all the way through to the kitchen  made herself a cup of tea  and sat 
Was she dressed?
down  n yeah she was dressed  sat down and ha she didn't even, she walked past Auntie Alice, she didn't even say good morning grandma good morning nan or anything.
Yeah?
And then she slopped herself down, got a fag and just about choked me and Auntie Alice out and then she did start to speak.
So well she obviously needs a fag and a cup of tea before she 
Well  she's only just joined the human race when she's had a fag and a cup of coffee.
Well that was quar that was about twenty past eleven.
Yeah I know but I mean the, the fag and the coffee revived her.
And she'd only just got up?
was still in bed.
What a mess.
Well Auntie Alice said you can't wonder they stay in bed.
She said  they bought theirselves a a bottle of brandy last night and erm
Oh christ, that's why then.
some Babycham and she said they'd sat there and drank a bottle of brandy and Babycham all night she said.
Good grief.
Good goodness.
Goodness me.
Bloody alcoholics then.
Well they have erm three bottles of lager on a Saturday night and they're them big bottles like that, you know them plastic bottles?
Three bottles they drink between the two of them.
Bugger me.
Do they really?
Well last Wednesday my supervisor put on my clock card A A.
So I said why?
I said I've been sitting here all lunchtime trying to sort out what bloody A A is apart from Alcoholics Anonymous.
A A?
I said on my clock card.
Authorized absence he said.
I said oh.
I said I was getting quite concerned about something .
I thought you thought I was on the wagon or something.
Couldn't you think of that?
I just couldn't, I thought  I thought it'd got something to do with absence.
I kept thinking absence absence absence
I'm gonna send that off.
Try and win that.
We had, that's like we had a letter the other day we had to sign for Jonathan.
That  and I said to Geoff what's D O B?
Date of birth.
Date of birth.
Yeah.
Dob.
Dob.
Dob.
Well cos see I do DOB all  the time so I know what it is .
Yeah well I I said to Geoff  I thought about it, but I did that come to me quite quickly but Geoff couldn't think of it could you Geoff?
That's that's like erm  when we had a new girl once we put on the card BANW banw.
Mm.
So she said  what does banw mean?
She said I can't work that out .
She said I've thought of everything.
I said broken appointment no warning.
That DOB could really mean 
 
a lot of things.
You can find a lot of 
Innit?
words for that.
Yeah.
Broken appointment no warning.
Mean they didn't let us know.
Yeah.
But then there's another one, D T C.
She she said  what's D T C ?
Said dental treatment complete.
In fact all I do is two lines like that.
A line like that and a line like that.
Cos that means  treatment's complete.
Mm.
Oh.
But it's, we use  we use all little sort of erm  symbols and things as well.
And I mean if, not unless, if you don't know them, you have to learn them.
round the home there's  
I mean I used to, I can chart the American way you see cos but the American way is different to the British way cos we just count number one to eight but with an American they go one one, one two, one three, one four, one five, one six and then they come this way.
And then that one is two one, two two, two three, two four like that.
And then you go this way and that's three  three one, three two three's four.
Then you go there and that's four one, four two.
So you've got tooth number forty one, thirty eight, you see  but you ain't got all them teeth in your head.
Blimey.
How confusing.
Well I said that's a complicated way but I have to do that when I go over to Marks and Spencers you see.
Why do you have to do it over Marks and Spencers?
Well because they cut, they chart that way.
That's continental as well.
We'll probably have to go to that  if we join the Common Market.
That'll fuse confuse every dental nurse in the king in erm England.
Cor.
It's dark out there.
In England I think.
Well it's getting late.
What's the time?

So then next week oh she said, I got in bloody deep water last week 
Go  go and put your shoes on Jonathan.

I said 
Oh  
So Dave looked up, he said well Ann worked you have to  pay her, simple as that isn't it?
She  she said I got  
Jonathan .
Stay in here with it .
  

she said  I should have waited until Val had worked had worked  
Aah!
Come and get your shoes on.

So, so he said 
Oh I burnt my finger.

Get your shoes on please.
Yeah I'm doing it.
Oh  
She said well yeah possibly.
He said well do you wait for April for your money from your patients?
Bloody right.
So she said no.
So he said well 
Well we w Geoff nearly had 
I've never heard anything like it.
Well Geoff nearly had a fit about this firm who owes us two hundred pound.
It's more than two hundred quid isn't it?
Yeah.
I'm ringing them in the morning.
Well, in the afternoon I think that's better 
Why's that?
cos they're never there, seem to be there the 
Why, what's the matter with them?
Well  the old boy  works at   Beck and Pollitzers you know?
Oh yeah in Lynn.
And erm  he's hired from me for some time now
You'd better send the mafia round Geoff.
and he said some time ago, he rung up one afternoon 
Susan.
and he said my boss 
Mm.
erm  wants a minibus  like his boy was in some sort of football team  and they need a b need a bim need a minibus.
So the bloke come over and hire it.
Quite a nice old boy.
Hired the minibus.
No problems.
Well then he rung up  few weeks ago and he said  to June, we'll need a car for a week.
One of the  whether it's him or whatever but one of the people who work there needed a car for a week.
The boss.
What  not the Belmont?
The boss had it.
I thought the boss had the Sierra.
Yeah but the boss had the Belmont as well in the first place because erm 
Oh did he?
he couldn't have the Sierra cos the Belmont was the only one what was there.
Oh.
Well he said send the bill in.
Anyway we sent the bill in.
Well anyway 
Twice.
a fortnight afterwards  he rung up and  said his boss had sm something had smashed into his car, and he wanted a car.
So he had the Sierra  and he said I don't know whether he'll want it for, it could be sort of three or four weeks if they're gonna repair his car  or if we can get one within the company like at another depot  obviously they'll get that for him rather than hire one off you.
Well they had it so long anyway.
So he had it couple or three days didn't he?
Yeah.
Erm  it would have been three days cos that's ninety odd quid, ninety six quid.
Joey  tells me last night  he said oh by the way he said you don't wanna hire your car  up er the Berry's.
I said why's that?
Oh he said they've got all sorts of aggro he said.
The father's  had his house repossessed for not paying the mortgage.
And he said the boy has been done by Budget for hiring a Sierra from them and taking the engine out 
The engine out.
and putting it in one of his cars.
And replacing it.
Gawld.
So I said to June, the only thing what flashed through my mind, not the fact about having the engine out or something like that  but what flashed through my mind  was whether it was for Beck and Pollitzers at all.
But I said to Geoff I think it was quite legit because a young boy come  down with him
Mm.
who'd just started working for them and he w he didn't look 
Oh yeah.
that type of boy.
He looked  he said I've not bo been with them long.
I've only just started so he said er I've just come down to  you know.
Don't you ever ask for any proof of identification?
Well we know who they are!
Well  you see  been hiring from me for ten years.
Beck and Pollitzer 
They live next door to to Joey.
His father used to hire from  
They've been hiring us for ten years but we, we ain't gonna hire no more if they're changing the bloody engines.
And he said Beck and Pollitzers often hire cars he said and you know he said I thought I'd try and get you the business.
Well then about a month later he said  he rung June and said I've been speaking to Geoff he said and  th they wanna hi er hire a car for a week.
But they've never paid us yet.
But this is like now it must be 
A month.
Well, it's a good month.
Yeah.
So I'm gonna ring and 
Yeah, must be six weeks now.
I've got two or three people 
What, Beck and Pollitzer?
Yeah.
So we'll have to ring them tomorrow.
That's where erm Derek works innit?
Mind that don't hit you in the eye.
Yeah well at the moment we could do with that in the bank couldn't we?
Well that's what I'm saying you've gotta 
 
Well that's right.
Jonathan, if that breaks and hits someone in the eye, you will be in big trouble.
It doesn't cos it ties a knot.
It'll hit him in the eye 
That'll hit his own face.
I like him in that jumper and my friend gave him that.
That's  
Isn't that nice?
Keep it low.
Yeah.
Let nanny have a go Jonathan.
Well keep it low, not near your eyes.
I did put my shoes on cos I thought I shan't get them on in a minute because my feet swell when I sit down.
Yeah?
It's not very strong string is it?
No.
Hasn't she got lovely teeth?
 
longer don't you?
Yeah  some teeth.
Well I think it's about time we was going Geoff if you've

Granddad, he don't know that does he?
Well if you'd have seen that  I mean I  and she sleeps in the airing cupboard  she's now started to get in there, but she's half out on the landing.
You can't shut the blinking door!
 
as you say like there's  something funny about cats cos I opened my wardrobe yesterday to get a coat out.
Tilly got in there and got amongst all me clothes and started sleeping there.
Yeah.
Then she gets in the back bedroom, we got a mirror at the back there what was took off one the dressing tables, and she sits and looks at herself in there and she keeps going  like that
Well my cat's going most peculiar at the moment.
and she gets, she gets, if you if you open a cupboard or a drawer  she's in it.
Even goes in the coal cupboard.
Yeah!
And I shut her in  the coal  
Comes out as black as  she do.

Five perhaps.
How tall are you?

Five foot one.
Cor.

I weigh eighty two kilograms.
I was a hundred and seventeen kilograms.

Are we going then everybody?
Five litres is 
Cos we said to him the other day how much is so and so Jonathan?
Well he can't work in  pounds and ounces 
They don't get involved in 
cos they don't work in pounds and ounces today.
No, no they don't.
That's right.
It's just kilograms kilograms innit?
   
We we are wrong by by doing it.
Aah.
But he, you see he's learnt the right way.
Ah  hurt my hand.
Are you doing French at school yet?
No.
Oh you will go when you go to the other school.
They've gotta start learning some more sex haven't they?
You can teach us all to learn French when you, once you start.
Yeah.
Oh oh.
Well they ain't learned nothing at this school yet.
And th there there was a cartoon in the paper in the week I thought  it made me smile really.
I know what number seven is in German.
It was a
What?
 
little boy had been to school and his mother and father was waiting for him to come home.
And they stood at the door, and of course he come home with his cap in his hand, he said  er they said oh  what you do how you got on today?

Yeah I did tell  mum but I can't say in front of Jonathan.
Yeah.
She, she was  well she didn't think it was right.
Yeah but the funny thing is, she swears and curses and says 
Absolutely.
all these rude and common things in front of him.
Why does she think that's right?
She got
Well you see the  
He's, and let's face it, that boy is learning the right way.
He ain't learning from slang is he?
That's right.
When that seven year old kid went in the bedroom and saw what they were doing that didn't matter.
No.
But when they teach it at school that's wrong.
That's it, yeah.
Well they .
got head screw 
Well  can't they?
No.
She wants a few more screws in  
Well you see 
No I do I think that's wise to teach them in schools because they learn the right way.
They learn properly.
Mm.
They they reckon they've gotta 
And then after that, what happens after that  they know the basics.
They know what's going on this that and the other.
Well they reckon they've gotta learn more now.

I said well perhaps Ell could go up then, cos I'm later ain't I?
No he's alright for that other   they ooh it's 
Glad I went over there.
it's dangerous!
You only op open it a certain way.
Well how we gonna get that bit down then?
Well you just have to  hire another ladder.
Yeah.
To get that after easier way, it cost me what?
Seven quid.
Oh wha wow!
five point three  I'm sure mum's got a three inch .
Oh well that ain't gonna help, you don't want !
You can have that there, so that's ri 
What are you gonna do about that?
I've done as much as I could with that one but 
Yes 
but then I'm waiting, see I I got erm  you know the big ones in the central root up there  I've I've hired one of these there.
Ah well that don't take   Brian get up there, she said well he's taller than you, I thought  
No I ain't.
he .
Get over like I said  she said that's enough like you've gotta leave some room for a   
But has that cost you about seven quid this one?
It was 
What?
twelve quid  that's the ladder  and  as well.
Yeah and scaffold.
I had them all the week   I mean a ladder I mean it'll cost you that much again
Yeah.
here, you can get one  
That's right I mean just do th both bits at the back and front at the same time, yes.
Sort out the high bits together.
Well why don't you get one of tho for Sunday 
Well yeah 
then?
We're going to.
But you have to pick it up Saturday though wouldn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I suppose that way you should be 
thought about it, they're not 
They're not expensive, mind but 
Yeah but you can store them.
I mean I I really could of  a I mean I hired that ladder just to do about  six foot either side.
Well that's about how I am  yeah I got three more feet.
But you got that  for your .
Yeah, oh sure.
After that lo lot 
Yeah.
unless you're taking the chance.
Yeah.
See that ladder you've got, you know the bit you had this morning?
Yeah.
If you have the back half of that  that'll be ideal.
Yeah.
I don't know, it's 
Yeah.
Ken's old one innit?
God knows!
Haven't got a clue whose 
Cos old Ken used to have to an old ar aluminium one didn't he?
Er, I think it was his dad's wasn't it?
What about oh it was out there.
Yeah I borrowed it , I borrowed that one, some time ago.
Where is that ladder?
We haven't got it.
Well I keep telling you to move that away from the house  I said talking about your rising crime, you're giving them a ladder to use as well!
That's right mate.
Your  cos we put it in the paddock didn't we?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll tell you what I did if I if that's ladder's out, I'd drop it down the back of somewhere.
Yeah.
Cos they've had people round and nicking things ain't they, out the back?
God knows!
Where?
Oh the   nicking out of the er sheds, lawn mo , lawn mowers and things.
Is that right?
Yeah  Nick knows who he is or some something like that  I would 
Well  there's isn't gone then!
It's in 
Yeah 
the garage.
Well why they don't lock it!
The garage is never locked!
Yeah.
Well  .
Well I don't suppose they'd be down here.
No but 
I tell you what we ought to do, I keep saying to Geoff, if we locked the garage door, you know the big garage lock, they can't get out can they?
They can, what you should do is just drop the ladder in out, in the inside that's all.
All they gotta do is pull on a cable  cos the door is locked 
Yeah but you can lock up can't you?
the door is locked from the inside, but you just got to pull the cable and it overrides the lock dunnit?
Yeah, they just pull upwards and 
Oh  I was gonna say, if you could stop them from undoing that door, they wouldn't never get it out of there would they?
Oh no.
But I mean there's 
in front of it   
Yeah i yeah that's the luck of the draw , you know.
Yeah, that's right.
I think that's all it is isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah that's a good idea put a  on it and then they'll go 
They'll go somewhere else then.
yes but 
I certainly wouldn't leave your ladders out though.
No.
Cos I mean that's stupid!
Well after you just  put it  
It's like  I'd never put those steps in their shed  you know, in case people sort of like
Yeah.
nosing about and they got, that makes 
Yep.
it easier dunnit?
Yeah course it does.
Oh they wouldn't stop them if they wanted to get in  but I mean it just makes it easier.
Wonder why everybody's going that way,?
I dunno mate, someone  Nick's house   cos I wanted to put a lot of stuff over my shed cos that garage is getting a bit congested 
Yeah.
and he said no, someone's going round nicking out the sheds and Nick said I know who he is, I thought
then?
Yeah  I mean .
Well you 
They know they should  on there.
Yeah.
You should be alright, cos you got the rottweiler next door.
That old thing, it's just driving us crazy a a and they couldn't

Why?
Well Marie's going in hospital.
Well why can't she go out for christmas dinner?
Oh well  you know she's got that bad back?
You told me she was having done.
Did I?
Yeah.
Well Jodie  wanted to come with us  and I phoned up and they couldn't get her in  so then she started saying well why don't you stay here mum,and all that, I said yeah  just when it bloody suits her she wants you to cook her dinner, said she'd have been  she should have   I said she'd be prepared to pay it, I've already got her a seat  she said 
Yeah.

So we what is ha what is she doing?
So she's not coming?
So now Marie's got to go into hospital and have this done, don't know if she'll be out on time and er  anyway  and so  they, you know, she said we've only got to face it mum, so she said well we can't come cos Marie can't face it  I said they all went and got 
 
their way with you again  she's just moved flat, June, they have  she had this lovely  facelift  Michelle went and put all the borders round  all curtains, rails, you name it she done it.

Well   Geoff laid all new carpets, I think she's having a security vault there but  Geoff 
Yeah.

Don't have a go at me!
she had our blue suite, such as it was, but  she was going to come right flat on her back  got his bedroom ready, for Ian  all that, cos they do.
We done it for  Kerry  and done it for her,Kerry left home  sorted all the house out and bought all the stuff back and give the rest away!
What?
And that  so I spent hours doing it   done it for Marie and she's only gone and swapped with the nurse!
And only cos   Well i cos he's gotta be .
Whatever does she need a big kitchen for?
Her and that little boy?
She's got a big round table.
It's hers if he comes round .
And Geoff, she said Geoff come round last night   he said she is in such a muddle and it wants such a lot doing to it!
Then won't she have the other girl 
But, but it's always so lovely!
So pretty  .
Well I can't  what, am I gonna go up the hospital then  with her!
She goes in the thirteenth and hopefully will be out the twenty third, I realize this is a big operation  but I want Cheryl to come along anyway, book the table, stay with us, come with us  If she couldn't make it  which she'll be in  so I do  understand that
Yeah.
bring her plate home  so  she said  she said that she don't know if she'll make it or even if she'll be home for christmas  so  erm  I said oh well   !
So, are you gonna go out now then?
Yeah  but she said wait for   
He wants to because  he doesn't want to go anyway.
Well who else is going from here then?
Just us and the   as I call them.
They're alright.
Well that ain't gonna be so good though, is it?
Then there's Maria  So I've gotta get and the she gotta invite .
So you've gotta co you've gotta cancel that then, cos she might have to pay.
There's six but it's u you can't help that can you?
An emergency operation coming up.
Yeah but you ought to let them know.
I'm going to!
I've she's only 
Or whoever is.
just told me a few minutes ago!
I said erm 
Well I should leave it till the weekend things could change.
No, I don't want to do that  I just said to her, I said  you know, you can sort of erm  ask Brenda  she said I'm doing that I'm not  on christmas day, would you?
I said well frankly Cheryl with her record  I'm not in  I said she takes off when she pleases, she comes down when she wants something  I said she doing me some  good at christmas I said I do I quite understand that   I said I do understand and I'm  I've nothing nothing to do with me that's entirely up to you and she said and you wouldn't tell me what to do  you won't change our minds, I said  no I'm not trying to change your minds but you asked me what I would do  I said and I think  there   and now she's    She said and I don't care what you done,I'll do I'll do, I said she's got hundreds of  where they smash the windows and break into so regularly.
Whatever's the matter with the girl?
Ju Jim said he was going to   down here.
So there's Julie, Ian and  James aren't gonna go to the meal at all?
She wouldn't let him come with us because she said that'd be our first christmas when we're altogether  I said yeah  that's the 
So 
for them  really.
Well why can't  if John and Jim ain't gonna go  Marie's not gonna go, why can't Cheryl still go  and then
Cos she's gotta stay and cook dinner for Jodie who's crept back  Jodie and Shaun  Marie  who's crept back  and Jodie.
So she's gonna have a he heavy work  
There's .
again?
Again  I've tried to tell her  but he said, Geoff said we shall have a lovely time, we shan't go short  I said I know that!
But I said that 
But that's got nothing to do with it!
That's just  you again!
I 
Well I 
have yo we got the cancellation I reckon  cos  
That's mucked your plans up as well innit?
Cos you 
Well 
all enjoy going together.
I said well I hope you don't 
I'll tell you something, why don't you go and invite Carole and Brian?
That's what she said.
Well I would, I should go up there and have a word with Carole and Brian cos they sit on their own  all christmas virtually!
They do well last year they had egg and chips!
They 
Yeah.
they tried to go out for a meal, I don't know whether it was christmas day or boxing day  down in  and they couldn't get n in nowhere, I said well you wouldn't on a boxing day!
I said to Cheryl please don't go and invite  to come to yours for dinner now  and because  insult us cos  we're not without him  cos I'm prepared to go  I look forward to that.
Now I said to Ken that'll be your christmas present to me in nineteen years  and that'll do me a treat cos that's really worth it.
Yeah.
I said you can bloody do it for me!
I do it for you all year  and that's for me.
So is Gill going with you?
Well I mean, going with Jim but obviously it won't be much fun for just for him so 
Oh no!
Cheryl said invite him round there to be with Gill, which is better than Gill .
Well a yeah it's nice for Gill really cos he don't enjoy it.
But we're enjoy it.
Then he'll want to come back.
Oh well!
You know.
But then you can't in 
But I said Cheryl  if  we do sell these tickets to whoever  and they think they  round yours, I said they can, you know what  she said no  I don't want anyone else, I said that's fair enough.
Yeah well then that's gonna be awkward really if you invite Carole and Brian and then just dump them off  ain't it?
Do you see what I'm 
Well I'll have to tell them  because  erm  you know if 
Oh what a 
they're bringing plaster   
Oh what a shame!
and we've gotta buy a can of oil but then there's   and then Nick and  Cheryl  
Yeah but they ma they make 
and her mother in there  I don't know.
You don't know when Nick's  well her mother don't come christmas!
Don't she?
No!
But  she wouldn't mind coming along cos she likes him.
What  
 
Oh they have to bring 
But I said to him, I don't care otherwise  ooh can Cheryl can't make it, would you like it?
I said they gotta say she come to us now mate
Yeah  and then if I can't 
 
bloody go, yeah that's right.
And invite you  she said well that's  you're not going so they wouldn't get in anyway now and
Well that's embarrassing for you to do that though won't it?
So I said 
Well I I know where I am so I ain't gotta worry  but boxing day we're going to  well I was going to mum's  I'll come up and see you boxing day though.
Yeah.
Like I normally do.
Well we're going to mum's but  Geoff said well I I hate them  cos Bobby and Pam are going I think this year  he said well if I get fed up doing that evening he said I'll come home early.
Yeah.
So I said oh  fair enough, I don't mind.
Yeah.
That's entirely up to him what we do  but I shall be up for  dinner  you know and sort of see you and then  if Geoff wants to leave early, we will.
Well I think the only difference is   I say to her I hope you're still  cos she said to me you can come, I said I'm coming straight round yours christmas day, I'm not coming home waiting for you to come back, you don't come till half past ten!
I said and that's if for me  I said parting company if we go to dinner we stay together!
Yeah.
The best of the   cos she 
yeah 
she'll say  we'll just go and get changed and we'll be back, they all fall asleep  this and that and you know they don't want to come out!
Oh that's no good is it?
But 
So 
but you can go straight for the meal, straight round hers.
and then is she coming back to you at all?
And they're supposed to be coming boxing day.
We will they?
Well that's what Ken said  he said will they  stay again  Marie's going
Yeah well even if they came sort of late afternoon, turn up about fiveish and had a  a bit of tea and then spent the evening with you  that won't be too bad would it?
But, June I can't tell you how that baby's dominating their life  I mean 
Well that's ridiculous!
I said to her if she didn't make it the first time, let her lend you my hammer  she said don't you talk like that and don't you let e Geoff hear you!
Well anyway  Friday night he slept all night  Saturday night he had her up all day!
He says get her  
What's the matter with it?
and he talk, he loves, he likes me now, cos he never did  and he says  he .
Well what's  does he he just shows her how to  
home late and he goes  she wa he watches her go upstairs  Woooh!
Come on!
You feel insecure don't you and there she is  and look  come off it!
She ge it's really getting me  he watches her.
Well innit ridiculous!
So he  
I better go in a minute.
Last night she trotted to bed, and he did sleep all night long, but he didn't go till half past ten  cos Marie don't put him to bed.
Well you see  children need routine really, you need to get into a routine, when you get into that 
But he  yet!
Well he wouldn't be would he?
She's been up since six  and he is up  
Yeah and that  
sleep all day and  night.
Well that's gonna wear her, that's gonna make her ill.
I said  Oh I said oh you did use my hand blender, I did leave it for you  then she 
Well what 
she  you know I said
But it's silly to let a baby rule your life ain't it?
I mean  or anyway, it isn't her baby is it?
I know it's her grandson but
Right next thing you ask her to stand in the middle of the road and  under a train and she would do!
I can't tell you what's she like with him!
She don't put him down for a minute, oh he feels insecure and he's left his mummy and goes   love his granny and  come on your granny, I think oh carry on!
Well she had erm Sam one night didn't she?
She put him through it.
Oh I bet she did, I bet she didn't treat him like that!
She didn't  and she got two hundred pound Friday night.
Did she really!
pay her a hundred pound a week!
Good heavens!
Yep  cos it's two of them.
Well if I'd have known, I'd have had it!
Well  and she put him through the hoop,nurses him.
No but you don't  you don't do that sort of thing.
And I  I handle  but he had a wha you know I wouldn't let him run over me but
No
she's    walking the  through it and stuffed them in the ground!
She goes 
Well then that's her fault isn't it?
What can you do about that?
I bet she's gotta get  irate and ring me back, tell Geoff what I said, I thought well I don't care, she's speaks it and I'll just say to her quietly well, you know  I said now Marie's done this to Geoff after all his hard work and he's helped his   worry anyway  then defies him, he begs her to leave and she defied and she's moved.
Well I think really if he's if he's 
I will do it.
gotta say to her and now you gotta stand on your own two feet  everything we do you keep changing so
Well I've never ever  run 
Well look 
any of them down  .
No.
Michelle hasn't done it frequently  but i you know I would never even talk to me like that  Sarah the little  erm  madam that she is, just like Kerry, which they are!
Well they do get like that 
Geoff 
at that age don't they?
you know  and I've never  never said anything about them 
No.
but today I did  you know when she said to me though, what would you do?
Well that's a disappointment for you Val isn't it when you get ?
Well I said to Marie  you know it just got round
The whole thing!
you know, and they're always , she said well get on , yeah I know we do  but I said I just don't want  you know 
Because let's face it Val  she is a type of person, you get her in a party or anywhere  you know you're gonna enjoy yourself.
Yes  
I know she thinks says things  you know she embarrasses me at times 
 
but I know  you know if she's there you're gonna have a good time.
Yes, that's right.
You know erm  and I  if she if she goes to emba cos I think she does it for the purpose really  to people 
Yeah.
she tries to embarrass 
Oh yeah.
them you know
Yeah.
I try to ignore her, if I can wha 
Or start laughing.
Yeah  when she tries to d 
Yeah.
Like last time at the party  well I just ignored her, I just looked the other way  well Caroline she well
She'd want to be like him.
Do you know what?
No way!
She  she told Alan to me
Ooh!
I think it's best if you go Alan  so he said well shall we ask the children what they think, so he brought all the kids down  
Oh no!
he said what do you think Ben?
So he just stood and   so they said and what about you ?
Then she cried  so she said, what about you Sam?
So she said I was so proud of him, he said  yes dad I think it would better for us all if you left  she said I was so proud of him.
Proud?
And Val  told Cheryl so now it's   and er  I said I think that's awful!

So she said I'll do it on the computer and  and I'll let you know  so  we're eighty pound behind  well course we never sent one month at all!
Did you not?
No!
So we got behind  So I said well we'll tr I'll try and get caught up  sort of, in the new year  you know, get them  a bit .
Actually I think I'm gonna finish that catalogue anyway I'm just 
Which one are we talking about?
Grattan.
Oh yeah.
And just have the other one cos they're such a peculiar funny firm they are!
Mm.
So I explained to them, I said well that's cos you changed over  and I sort of never put it across through  oh she said well don't worry I've done it now, she said you haven't got anything to worry about now, I said well it did bother me a bit  to think that  I didn't think you had my payment!
Oh yes she said, we've had it  I thought well why send me letters,then!
Well that's a standard letter I suppose and
Well that's what she said, that's a standard letter.
Yeah  the only trouble is, you know, standard letters don't always sort of 
Well you get some little old dear what runs the 
That's right.
catalogue to
Yeah.
get a little bit of pocket money or  that's the only way she can get anything!
Oh they're out in that car again out there.
They've been working on Sarah's today.
Damn!
They're up to the roof aren't they?
Yeah  Yeah 
What's 
they put the trusses on and then they fill the gables in  and then put the  tiles on.
I didn't think Sarah didn't go to the ol lo oh had  oh I wouldn't of thought that was a pair,
Oh no they want something flash don't they.
Well Val was telling me  Caroline got the kids all in a row  and said something about erm  you know, more or less to say well  I want to leave your father  she said 
She did?
what do you think about it Sam?
And he just put his head down.
And what do you think about it Erica?
And she burst into tears!
And what do you think about it erm  what did I say the other one's name was?
Ben, Erica
Which one did I say?
That'll be Ben the oldest.
Ben, Erica you said  Ben and Erica.
No it was Sam.
Oh sorry, Sam  no it's Sam, Erica.
Yeah well anyway the other one
Yeah.
he said well I think that's the best you can do father, he said we've had enough hassle for you for all these years!
So she said  quite right, she said he's done nothing but bully you lot ever since you've been children!
So she said and I felt very proud of my son, ah I said I wouldn't want a son of mine who said that to his father!
No.
I wouldn't of wanted it.
Well no, but on the other hand  you know
Yeah but all said and done Geoff, they are his fa , he is their father.
Yeah but I mean it depends what sort of bloke he is, and I mean if he is like that 
He  you know what a big head he is.
Yeah but I mean you don't know what he's like to his kids do you?
Well she said he he's done nothing but bully them.
Well then the kid's right ain't he?
Well  you heard what he said he wants his children to have a good education and he pushes them  all the time, they've gotta  if they do anything 
Yeah.
they've gotta be brilliant at it  But 
Yeah.
you see some children ain't got it in them and  you know 
Oh yeah.
but you heard what Ashley said about swimming.
Made them  yeah.
Well, to me if a child has got a   by all means encourage along  but you shouldn't push them into anything cos  later on in life they get a bloody complex about everything  you know if they
I don't know.
if they've got a job or something they're frightened they're not gonna do well and
Where do you draw the line between  you know, not sort erm  encouraging and not
Well I do it all look at  it's the way you say it.
Well that's what I'm saying, so perhaps the kid was right in what he said.
Well yeah but I wouldn't 
Been a bastard to him well
Well would you like your son to say  I think 
Well no but I don't to think I am like that with Jonathan.
Well no.
Well I don't like  
But he's always been like that with them kids you know yourself  if they do anything it's gotta be done
Well you know how he is, if you say too much to him, don't do that, don't shout at me!
He soons  starts squawking and  wiping his eye and stamping about the place  but if he's like that  all the while to them  so what is .
They've all gone off to Fiji.
Who has?
The parents, he said he was going didn't he?
Oh him as well?
So she said, Val said I thought  good for you mate, you didn't get pushed out  he's gone  they're all gone  till the new year innit?
Well I wouldn't of wanted to go with them myself.
Well not after that little escapade, nor would I.
I wouldn't of thought so  I would of sa I would of said well if I bloody ju good enough for living with I bleeding come on a  I don't think she'd want him on holiday with her anyway  and her sister said is she hadn't got enough money, she'd pay for it.
That's right  that's what Val told me.
She don't have time for him.
What?
She hasn't got a lot of time for him now.
Who hasn't  her sister?
Her sister.
No  she just says he's a bloody big head!
Well he is isn't he?
Well yeah.
Ah I mustn't I must admit I don't think I know any worse than him.
But I think he's quite harmless really Geoff  I don't think he 
Oh yeah.
means any harm, that's his way.
Well that's yeah but I I must admit I find it quite tiring.
Well he's always been pleasant to me  you gotta 
I can honestly say  he's the sort of bloke I would sort of try not to get lumbered with at a party or somewhere like that   I mean I don't mind I didn't mind talking to her  but I find her
Well I find her  boring.
Yeah.
I find her very boring  although she's a very kind person.
Yeah, no I could talk to her more than I could talk to him.
I'm surprised  you know, she isn't stuck for them children mo any more if he'd been 
Oh yeah.
like this  that's it.
Let's face it she erm  I mean she was the one who bloody married him!
Well she hates him!
Yeah.
She literally hates him!
Yeah.
Well I think that's awful  I do.
Well yeah   well I suppose that's what she thinks, if she gonna go through the rest of her life with a bloke she hates.
Well she might as well get rid of him now, I suppose  while she's young enough to find perhaps find 
Yeah.
somebody else.
Well whatev whatever's all this big house in aid of then?
I bet they're gonna build it and sell it!
Well that's gonna be the farm though innit?
They'll have to sell   sell the farm and everything.
Well yeah, I would've thought so because le 
And hope .
Well let's face it erm  he's got a, a half  a half a right to it.
I know yeah.
He's worked hard, he's worked  he ain't he does work, when he works.
Does he though?
Well I dunno.
I always see him riding about up the  Steven   there  he's always up there  I know when I used to work for  it was always Steve who used to be  riding to this farm, riding to that farm, checking on this, checking on that and taking the wages round that sort of thing.
And he does it now does he?
Oh yeah.
You never see that  erm  do you?
No you don't.
Well yeah cos  when you think like that  if they do pack up he's got no  no nothing.
No not really.
Well not unless they  they don't sell that house  well look at poor old Dick!
Yeah but he's just about retiring age anyway isn't he.
Yeah but he's still gotta have a home to live in Geoff!
Well yeah, alright  yeah but they normally get out don't they?
When they were  like Jack  what's his name?
Erm  Jack  the foreman he got out and when he  when he retired cos  you know
Well that's like er 
the house went with the job.
but then they've got er  er  said they  they asked if they could  rent his house off him until they got themselves sorted out.
No bloody way he said!
Did he?
I thought to myself well yo if Laura had a house and then thought Pete was in that in that position, I'd of helped him.
Did he really?
Yeah  well they've had they've had a big  today.
Who have?
.
Oh?
Well I thought she said I ain't gotta  then have they?
A hundred pou thous thousand in debt  they had two lo two bloody great Morgan cars!
About what was that?
Well I reckon that's her  either his mother or her mother.
Yeah.
Cos when I was coming home from Pete's  a bloke stopped me  er  whatever's that noise?
I dunno.
A bloke stopped and he said er  can you tell me where  is?
I said well you're in the   oh he said I'll tell you what I want, a little black and white house  I said it's just there look  I said nearly you're nearly on top!
He got a few yards down, he said  so I said well  have yo you haven't come round to view the house today have you?
Oh no he said, I said because they got a funeral on, he said that's what we've coming for, we're coming to pick granddad up.
Oh.
Well I thought well I didn't want people going round there 
No.
Well  that was a waste of their time if they'd have gone round there to view them, weren't it?
Yeah.
So that  was not having a lot of flipping luck is she?
No.
But they haven't put them out their home.
No.
Alright, but I think they've gotta re-house them first haven't they?
I dunno.
Well yeah they just shove you out on the street, they gotta  especially if you got children they gotta re-house you.
Yeah.
But I dunno  whatever's  whatever's this bloody world coming to?
, she said I really don't where it's gonna end Geoff, I don't know no more.
Well you never guess what she said today?
No.
Well I wa she said  I'm gonna start up drinking June  I said you're not!
She said I bloody well am!
She said you can up and have one with me if you like sometimes, I said alright then.
She said well he's got his fags, she said I'm gonna start drinking!
I said well  be warned Val!
She said  I know when to stop, I thought yeah but 
Yeah but 
that
I've heard all that before!
Jonathan what are you doing ?
Ooh and there's ooh something else happened as well!
Yeah.
She erm
Sha Sharon's not going out with them now  for Christmas.
Oh yeah, why's that then?
Cos Marie's going in hospital having her operation.
Yeah.
She said and I'm not leaving her to  you see!
No.
But Val said them children  them children have  they manipulate her.
Yeah.
I thought well  manipulates you Val.
.
So she said erm  I'll bloody told her straight she said!
But she said    there's Geoff worried sick about that old girl
Yeah.
because he's said  well she's go she's  they got her this little place, didn't they?
Sorted it all out for her and carp it was all carpeted everything
Yeah.
now she's gone and moved down in West .
But he  Val said it was that flipping rough
Yeah.
and the house is like a tip!
Yeah.
And she said Geoff kept saying to her oh I wouldn't move from where you are, you know you got your place lovely i if you  the reason she moved was cos she wanted Tony to get the  breakfast round    What was said  that's what Val said.
I can well imagine.
So she said    the  's go out with them don't they?
Di oh yeah  That makes me laugh!
What?
What does?
Well she isn't  is she?
Well erm   
That's what I mean they don't call them  they call them   cos she don't want to lose her name does she?
Pathetic innit!
I didn't think Ken liked the woman.
Bloody arrogant can you get!
Well Ken don't like the woman anyway, does he?
I know he don't no.
Well I certainly wouldn't sit down at Christmas dinner with them  that's why 
Yeah 
they're going.
Oh you said yeah.
And er  Mervy.
Yeah.
And that's all now  so Val said  she said I said to Cheryl now don't you go and take Mervy away cos me and Ken certainly aren't gonna go and sit  sit with erm  the  's all  dinner time  so she said what they're gonna do, they're going out for the meal and everything and then they're  Ken  are gonna go to Cheryl's for the rest of the day  So I said so that's upset your plans then Val  she said isn't it just!
She said I've been really looking forward to it June.
Have a break  looked like she gonna cry any second!
She said
Oh.
Do you know me and Ted have been married thirty year  no not thirty, they've been going out together thirty years 
Yeah.
then she said do you know these last six months we do nothing but argue  she said we've never argued so much!
Yeah.
And she said oh I think it's only the pressure.
Well that's right.
I said well me and Geoff argue more, I said we never used to  cos we never argued a lot did we?
No.
Well we have done  I felt sorry cos I hadn't really  when she phoned me up over there I was up  I thought oh my God!
Yeah,
Cos I'm a bit worried we gotta get things sorted out  so I rang  I said I didn't to get onto you, she said no I know how they feel  she said  her granddad always do things like that.
What?
You know break appointments  I said well that only worries
it ain't quite the same is it?
well I said I suppose Geoff couldn't get away.
Well they just wouldn't let me   
I said that that worried m that really sort of worried me  so I rung her back anyway, she's alright.
Well, you don't wanna worry about them because at the end of the day, I mean if  if that was absolutely desperate I shall turn round and say well I'm sorry I've bloody got to and that's it!
You know, but I mean
But you must go Wednesday Geoff!
Yeah  No  
And she been 
it was  they was that panicking cos tomorrow morning, the ministry are coming  and 
Yeah.
they was panicking.
We all it is ba , well I say all it is  this bloody great strip right be between the ceiling and the walls, the right length of corridor and the manager see it and he said look  that should be shiny sort of like   and it's all pitted  so he said you'll have to go up here he said and do it all with steel abrasive  said fair enough.
So of course I, took me about half hour to find the forklift cos somebody had nicked it  by time I went got the chemicals Robin comes down, he said oh don't worry about he said do i do it tomorrow morning he said, they'll be nobody about then  can you go down the bot bottom and do the butterflies?
I felt well  bloody marvellous, you now,i it was that imperative it had gotta be done, you can't have time o no I'm sorry you can't!
So you could of gone to that appointment tonight?
Well, well no, no because it was then about, that's what I'm is, then four o'clock you see, so I mean I knew I wouldn't make it anyway  that's why I thought I'd better ring  cos the job that we finished was half past three so I thought well even if I come home  I shall be late even if I don't get changed and washed or anything.
Yeah well you can't go there not washed and changed.
No that's what I thought I was
But you got an appointment fo you could of had one for tomorrow but I thought Wednesday is a better day I thought.
Wednesday is a better day, and anyway Thursday's  erm   he's got a  he's gotta go at four  actually go at four not  an appointment, he's gotta go at four.
Why erm  why do the ministry keep coming down there then?
Do they turn up there?
Well I don't know, whether they're trying to catch them out but they they certainly coming down more and more an and sort of more and more frequent.
I'm surprised they warn them that they're coming.
Well it's erm  the sort of things they pick them on really is not that
Not hygiene sort of thing?
No, thing I mean silly little thing, well I think it's silly but there you are, they all see to  know what they're talking about but  I mean cer certain things like in the fillet room
Mhm.
the meat is not allowed to go on just an ordinary pallet.
It's gotta go on a special one?
It's gotta go on a steel pallet  and yet next door  in the export chiller  they're allowed to go on a wooden pallet  and we work on wooden pallets  erm
I'm surprised they use wood.
Well if you see how many pallets they got  and you see the trouble is the metal ones are so slippery  they're all the while dropping meat all over the floor.
Yeah I suppose they would, yeah.
There's loads of things they're on about  oh th the there's a whole  book what they gotta h have sorted out.
Do they?
Oh Christ yeah!
Certain doors are not to be opened  things like emergency exits there's  they notice that there's more one of the emergency exits is actually broken, so the door don't even open.
Bloody hell!
So all that stuff 
Well then that is, that's gotta be sorted out because if you 
Yeah.
had a fire there, somebody wouldn't get out properly!
That's right.
Yeah.
Well that's like us we haven't got an emergency exit.
What way do you go to your nearest exit then?
Well there's a bloody great  roller door, but you see it's at the end  we work
Yeah well what about if the fire was down that end?
Well exactly!
How would you get out?
We haven't got the   oh yes there is, oh course there is, that's a lie  we go through  yeah.
Yeah well what about if the fire's between the box room and this exit?
Well that's where they are      I went  that slid across there like that, phewf!
Where are you going?
What ab oi!
Don't ask then!
I mean I won't even talk to myself am I?
No..
I didn't tell your mum  that I'd got it on you see  she said now all that I've been saying!
So I said well no, no  they won't take no notice of that, I said anyone that's been
Yeah.
I said they ain't gonna say  ooh that's Val on there, I said the 
No they don't know who it is, do they?
I said well they don't know!
No  it's the London University of
What is it?
London University.
In Cambridge got something to do with, what was that he said?
Well anyway something about University  you know all these  studies they do.
Yeah.
It's all about speech patterns.
Geoff and Joan  thought erm  someone was trying to  rob us along here!
He sat  in his car out there 
Poor little man!
and they thought that he was the accomplice  sitting outside while somebody was going round the house.
I said I don't know what hollering for, he's got a bloody 
I'm surprised they haven't got 
rottweiller there!
the bloody postman down as a
Oh yeah.
detective or something!
But how pathetic!
Yeah.
Well  well no, you know I had  at mum's  and I 
yeah 
come home and I thought well I'll drop that, I'll stay and go up the ladder  and I was gonna do painting  you got him  Hey up!!
So I jumped right away.
 
!
Then I thought what on earth did he say!
And then I just never understood a word of what he said.
Well I can never understand him.
No I can't.
I thought what ever's he on about!
I can.
If we ought to had him mate  they'd have thought he'd come from 
Well 
another planet!
I can't never understand him.
No I must admit I can't.
We have this French woman come in  she comes quite often Mrs   and  she said  I'd like to make an appointme appointment on the  she said the eleventh, and I thought   I said  pardon?
And she said it again and I thought well i it didn't sound  like eleven  eleven   I don't know what it sounded like really and I just went  so that'll be Wednesday the eleventh?
And I thought  if she says yes, I've got the date right !
Yeah.
And did you get it right?
Yeah  that's embarrassing, you feel an idiot don't you!
I was just gonna say yo 
Yeah 
I was just gonna say you got a purple tint in your hair but I can see what it is now!
 
She got those to 
purple tint on top.
I like her hair tha that colour do you Geoff?
I don't mind either way really.
I don't look like Ann  now do I?
No !
 
I dunno 
No.
Well I think er  the funny thing is  it's looks dark  now.
Yeah.
Well that's cos it's always been so light 
But I suppose it's been  
isn't it?
Yeah.
Ah I like it  I knew there was something 
Oh I like her hair.
different to me  have a at least when you have it down Sarah   
If you think so I've 
Yeah.
I think I could of 
Oh yeah 
er I mean I know it's a bit messy at the moment, I ain't washed it since last time you see!
Oh I see yeah.
isn't you really?
No  erm  but when I  when I have I'm so used to having it up and all tucked back  when I have it down I feel scruffy
Yeah?
Yeah  I think you do feel tidy if your hair's off your face.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm  but mind you I had that headband   didn't I?
But what I'd like to do is  I'm gonna  set it on rollers  I'm gonna blow dry the top  I'm gonna 
Yeah.
set the back on rollers  and then, you know when I have it  all  clipped there with an oval clip 
Yeah.
in my neck?
Secure it there, pin it all under, then I'd like to get a net with sequins on it  or  
Oh yeah!
or something  to put over it  for evening, but I can't find one.
I wonder where you find one of them from?
You know, sort of back comb it out so it's sort of 
Well they must do them Sarah, mustn't they?
Yeah  but I thought I ain't seen anybody  with it like that  be a bit different, sort of when we go out New Years Eve and that.
Mm  where's a ?
I don't think we got one round here.
Only Peterborough I suppose.
Peter or Cambridge I suppose.
Yeah.
Mm.
And or perhaps a real sort of top hairdresser, they might have them  they sometimes have bits and
Yeah.
pieces don't they?
Well that used to be all the rage once, didn't it?
Yeah  I mean we got hairnets at work   sort of  clear ones though.
I remember hairnets
You get 
Oh yeah!
O yeah 
and
But they're erm 
They're red.
Ah no ours are just  you couldn't tell you'd got it on.
No.
No.
Sort of a hair colour  practical 
Yeah.
you see.
That's right.
But I think  next time I might have it cut short.
You're not!
I might do, I don't know  I'm fed up with it  really!
You want a change?
How 
Yeah.
was you thinking of having it cut?
Short.
What short short?
Yeah.
Actually I think it suits you, I mean really i like  it's not on her face anyway isn't it?
No  so short 
So I think 
No.
short hair would suit you cos you haven't got it all over your face have you?
Cos I saw erm  a photo when I was eighteen and I it was  sort of short in the neck  over my ears  short in there and then sort of fuller there and then just a bit of  you know a light fringe not a heavy fringe  and I thought I might have it like that so
Yeah.
That'll be nice  I can't really remember  
Well I think if that was me  I'd have that done now  in case you don't like it by the time you  you get married and that could be growing again.
Oh no I wouldn't have it cut until after I got married.
Oh 
No.
you'd have it cut after?
Yeah.
Oh.
Cos I definitely want my hair long for when we get married.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah  so that I can either have it  up or down really.
Yeah.
I've got the choice then.
Yeah  I do do you know I don't like to see brides with their hair down  if you've got long hair i 
Oh.
but I don't think  sometimes I think  well if it looks nice  but some of them brides on there that just hangs   don't it?
Oh yeah, I'm not having it like that.
Mm  I think I but Sarah did it at work, she did it  sort of plaited it  from here round
Oh yeah!
and this was taken up in like folds  but the plait stood away from the head, it sort of come out
Oh yeah!
you know, as you get them half baskets that fit on a wall
Mm.
Yeah.
not as much but it sort of come out like that  and then you sit your flowers  it makes that a shell  if you know what I mean?
Oh yeah!
But it  it's flatter coming on there  and then you sit your flowers  all along on there  but
Oh that's sounds nice!
but then I'd  I like it fuller and  prettier.
Yeah.
You know I'd like  a little bit more curly and  not 
Yeah.
curly curly but sort of fuller and
Well you'll have to have it done a couple of times
Yeah.
sort of try two or three styles then  sort of how  well you gotta think about your headdress and that first, haven't you?
Yeah.
What you're gonna have and then pu guide your hairstyle to go with it we or
Yeah.
or your wearing wha 
 
well, yeah.
No I'll be the next sa 
What  you be doing in the new year Sarah?
I know, I think after Christmas I'm gonna go and have a look for some dresses and  you see when it was an ordinary colour I was gonna have ivory  but now it's this colour  I think i'll be better having  having white, I don't know.
Mm.
I think if you've got the   white .
Yeah.
Yeah but you aren't 
But then 
you haven't got a white skin Sarah have you?
You've got a sort of a bit of an olivy skin haven't you?
It's not  
Yeah  yeah.
Yeah so you will have time to
I shall be out there  every day !
get a 
Yeah.
tan won't you?
Yeah.
You'll have time to do that.
You see if you have iv , and ivory dress  certain colour bridesmaids dresses don't go with ivory.
Yeah.
So they do do they?
No.
That sort of thing.
You're right  yeah.
Cos I think with ivory, I think peaches and that look nice, but I think with white  I like stronger colours .
Yeah.
Still, I don't very often wear pale colours.
Will you have your bridesmaids dresses made?
I don't know  I hadn't really thought about it.
Had you thought about your bridesmaids yet?
Yeah  I am not gonna have all  six I think.
Oh are you!
Yeah, but I'm short of two little ones, or one little one  erm  Amy's cousin Joanne  and  and then Helen  Florence's little girl, Helen
Yeah.
and Amy's cousin Claire  and then this girl who's hair I do
What?
This girl who's hair I do  erm her little girl, Karla  cor she's  if I found a little girl to look like her, I'd have one!
Oh.
But she is so pretty!
She's got white blonde hair.
So you want another little one?
Yeah.
Are you having any page boys?
Yeah I might do  yes erm  probably Ben.
Well didn't you just have
That's what mum said, have the 
Why don't you have the 
little bridesmaid and the page boy.
with the page boy?
Yeah.
Instead of having another bridesmaid, have a page boy  and so the two little ones  go up together  page boy 
Yeah.
and erm  bridesmaid and then have your bridesmaids behind.
Yeah mum, that's what mum said.
I think that'd look nice 
I might do.
a little boy and a little girl together.
Yeah cos they're the same age.
Yeah.
Both blonde.
Ooh 
Mm.
she's ever such a pretty little girl, she's got  white blonde hair 
Oh I think that'll be nice!
really sort of she's just a pretty little girl.
Yeah.
Then she dresses her lovely as well.
Then you haven't gotta worry about finding another one.
No  yeah I could do that.
Couldn't you?
But apart from that I hadn't really thought about it really.
Well , Jonathan don't do that  while that's on because it ain't no good doing it!
Well yeah  get over Christmas and then you can start sorting yourself out really.
Yeah , yeah I know  and I think once the  matters on  the bungalow and that
Mm  that's right.
Big!
I'm not big.
There's just a lot to think about isn't there?
Yeah.
Yeah cos tha once Christmas is here, that'll soon come won't it?
Yeah, eight months then.
It'll fly by now  Christmas 
Yeah.
New Year, Easter  
Ooh can't wait !
Yeah.
Can we go ?
Jonathan goes to  soon.
I can't wait till Christmas!
Not till next September  well it'll 
Next 
be soon after I get married then won't it?
Yep.
Yeah.
Oh!
I don't want to go in.
And  won't you Sarah?
I don't want to go!
You get the first week will seem a bit strange but once you get the first week over you're alright then.
Oh no!
I'll skip the first week.
You will be  won't you?
Yeah.
And you're working.
yeah.
Hopefully.
Yeah.
Well yeah, if he can get a job that is!
Mm.
How the job situation is these days!
You needn't get the .
He can't a job.
Oh!
What does he do then?
Well he's a labourer really.
 
What bi for builders?
Sort of classed as a labourer and  
He erm, he didn't have a job for two weeks!
He said he can't get unemploym erm  the dole or nothing cos he's self employed!
Then there's twelve of us down.
What?
Twelve is it?
He can't get any money se so so he can't get erm  what do you call it?
Social security
Social security.
if you've got money in the bank!
Well I said that's terrible that  our boy should suffer because he's got money in the bank, and saved his money!
Yeah.
He's gotta live off his ear off his money ain't he?
Well he isn't certainly gonna dwindle 
But why should you have to when you saved
Exactly!
saved it 
Too right Sarah!
for if you want a house or
See they'll maintain that 
Yeah that's right!
Social security .
I said you're paid the same.
No.
Social security is when you haven't got no money  and he has got money.
Well I ain't got any but they won't give me any!
Well that's like when older people when they save for their  retirement and that  you know 
Yeah.
they can't get things cheap like bus passes and all that can they?
No.
Well  Well I think, I, I don't think it pays you to save up  er 
No.
for your retirement and so you'll be comfortable off  cos you might as well live off your state like everybody else.
Yeah.
You might 
 
as well enjoy your money as you go along, why bother to have any!
They were saying on the television the other day 
Why bother!
the new taxes 
Well I certainly isn't going to, Sarah!
The new tax law thing  
 
I shall get as much out the system as I can mate!
Me me.
Well I told you that.
if they go up  erm  the government now wanna 
Help!
bring this new tax, but instead of poll tax and community charge and that  it's gonna be like a new erm  property tax.
Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that.
And er  what they're saying that, sort of, you get people, shall we say, older people who
He's   
are retired so they got no income  and then perhaps been left the house
Oh!
in in a will or something
Yeah.
so they have the house and move into house
Then they pay a lot 
but they're gonna taxed so heavily that they can't afford to live in it  under this new tax!
They've just gotta sell it!
I thought well  how  what a bloody shame!
Terrible isn't it?
Mm  I mean er why don't they do it on like the square, how big your house is because that way you could  I know it's not far when  people who live in a great big old house  don't have to pay as much cos if this  I mean Uncle Trevor and Aunty  they've got a massive great house  haven't they?
Have yeah.
But if this  because it's old or something they don't have to pay so much   the 
the 
rates
The rates, yeah.
you know?
Yeah.
But if you only went on the square foot it don't matter how big it was  well that's like, surely that'd be fairer?
That's right  it wasn't 
Yeah but ah then again why I mean like a lot of people have  don't have actual  they haven't got money  but they they sort of choose to have money tied up in property ,though it don't mean to say you're wealthy just because you've got a big house does it?
If 
No.
you've got no money  we haven't got any money  but, you know 
Doo doo doo doo  
I mean why should I I 
Why should you be condemned just because you've put your money into your house?
Yeah that's right, I mean some people don't 
Alright fair enough they want you to buy your own property but now .
Yeah.
Oh!
And if you go a spend if you in if you've got a big house and you tend to spend thirty thousand pound on a new car you don't get taxed on that   
Phone!
Phone Geoff!
new car.
Shall I pause this?
I thought it was the front doorbell.
Shall I stop it?
No, leave it on.
Well that's like  there's jobs like 
Shall I stop it till daddy's back?
your dad and  Geoff  they pay a stamp at Turners don't they?
Yeah, they do.
They still have to pay a self employed one as well you know?
I didn't know whether your dad knew that?
You still have to pay it back, I said well I don't think you should have to pay it back!
Cos you're going there because your own business has not  any more!
Yeah.
.
Well yeah, Geoff wouldn't be there if i if his business was running alright!
Well I said I don't think that's to e you should pay two stamps myself!
No  well there's nothing wrong in  pay any.
Like bloody !
Yeah  cor I could  I could  couldn't you?
I feel like giving him away but I don't know whether I would, but I feel like it.
Yeah.
I'm surprised someone hasn't.
Which erm relative of  's has died?
Dunno who has.
Well I reckon that's her mother or his mother.
I don't really know, I haven't heard 
Mm 
anything about it.
Somebody will find me .
Yeah because erm  as we come home from work  these two  sort of big saloon cars, black ones  sort of come up, mourning cars I suppose you call them  and they stopped at  's and picked a load of people up.
I thought you called a ?
No !
But you mean, no not them Jonathan!
Oh.
And then as we was coming home from Pete's, a chap stopped us  and asked us  where  was  so I told him where  was  he said I'm looking for a little black and white house  I said it's right there look!
He was right up to it  so I said well  I don't know whether you're going round to view the house cos that's on the market aren't they?
Here we are 
Yeah.
you got the  in here?
cos I said erm  no I haven't actually, stop  cos I said that 
That's what I've come round for!
then.
they got a death in the family today and then he said that's what we've come, we've coming to pick up granddad, so I reckon that is
Yeah.
her mother or his.
Better have the one who's died I think.
No!
It wasn't her June, was it?
No!
Not her?
No it was .
Oh well that's 
There was some smart cars round there today.
Yeah?
Oh  .
Ooh!
Hey?
.
Well I said they haven't had the house yet!
That's right.
I know !
I bet that  that's pretty  as well.
.
No that's him 
You've been in it!
that's him  on the phone  
So have I!
he was saying all the sort say at work you know that they   they don't know and they start on about er 
You have been a  .
you ruin your chances so  about three times a week the  comes in to arrange my poll tax and all this  and they get going you know well why should a bloke that  having a big house and he only pays the same rate as them  so I said, well it's like this as far I'm concerned I said  you know  no bloke  works perhaps twice as many hours as you do  he chooses
haven't you?
Yeah  yeah.
When I said, I think that's wrong!
Yeah.
The only time you don't pay a self-employed stamp  is if you  your business  earns,yo you can actually get away it, if you've lost money on your own business  on paper  or if you've  earned 
Well we have!
Why have you got it?
Yeah tha that's what I'm saying, I ain't got to.
You haven't got to pay it?
No   
What about that last lot?
Ah that's , what they've said once you've paid it, you can't get it back, and if you don't pay it they can't insist you pay it.
Well you haven't paid it.
No I paid the last one though.
Well you can't stop paying it now.
So you haven't gotta pay that one more .
No , I can't afford to.
Ooh good!
Good good good.
That's it, why should you have to keep 
Yeah.
paying for them all year long?
Ah but perhaps Ken's the same as you then?
Cos I shouldn't think he's made any profit.
Dunno, well that's the situation.
I think you're allowed  you're allowed to make thirty pound a week profit  fifteen hundred pound a year, anything over fifteen hundred pound  on your business  they   gotta pay tax.
Well you had a loss.
.
God!
So a I said it's a shock 
Ken lost 
we didn't know you see, well Geoff paid it last year, well he di he di he didn't have to!
My name is Jonathan  .
So that's like dad said, I mean  things 
Dad?
are not always
Can you pass me the
the people that have  left are sort of in the recession and that now, there's all the  really big business people and that  that have come down to the same level as everybody else.
That's right.
And they're all creating but  you know 
Yeah.
there's been a lot of people that have been  on that level for a long while.
That's right.
Yeah we have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, but now cos all tha all them estate agents that had  all the boom and everything didn't they?
Yeah.
Yeah  made a fortune didn't they?
Yeah.
Well but I mean, Brian was saying himself  you know  he can't remember  at least he's says he's been working down London when he hasn't been earning a hundred pound a day  you know, it's something, we just accepted it, he said over the years I've been earning a hundred pound a day he says, and that was it  you know yo yo just do.
And now he's nowhere  earning 
That's it.
nowhere near that amount.
He says he worked like a pansy he said and now he says I go 
Mm.
and he says and I'm putting in God knows how many hours, he said  and we got a drop to  fifty pound a day  .
He's halved them wages 
 
has he?
I said well exactly I said .
Is this our book mum?
Yeah.
But I mean I  I wouldn't even mind earning two hundred a fifty a week.
Well no, well I mean like we do I mean  I mean  but I mean  my gross up about three hundred over Tony's but I put in  many hours right?
Yeah.
isn't it about like that 
 
quarter to five in the morning 
I know.
till quarter five at night and then Saturdays as well till dinner time  you know?
But they 
Yeah.
better that me.
I found some  .
But then you want it .
Well that's right  that is 
They 
it.
So you're gonna get tax back as well, like you was told?
That's it  
Gonna get that back so  I mean all these little bits 
 
that are grumbling  cos they've come down, but really they've come down to the same level as
Well that's right.
everybody else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right Sarah.
They don't  
Well Brian was telling me 
levels off!
 
You was .
What's the time?
I'd better go in a minute.
Eight o'clo ,eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock.
Five past!
Oh I've got one of them things.
Geoffrey 
Oh.
wants one, don't you Geoffrey?
Er  no I mean, them over there 
Mm mm.
oh but they really get up my nose!just wanna do is phone me up, you know I I sa oh had a row with , don't say anything like  about quarter to four time  and I said to her, well I'll be quite honest   I said er  there's sixty pound a week  or seventy pound a week  I get more than you   I said I have never heard a load of moaning pratts in all my life!
I said you  overtime  you're moaning cos you gotta do, oh yeah  we're always 
Yeah.
the one's that have gotta   I said and as soon as you ain't got no overtime  ooh we aren't allowed a lot this week, we're a bloody flat week da and a   I said I don't know what to do to keep you happy!
I said if you said to me, Geoff, I want all the overtime I can get  I can get the overtime  I'll go round and I'll try and   or if you say to me well  I don't want the overtime, I'm quite happy with a flat week  then I'll know what I am  but I said you change from day to day, one day you wannit, another day you don't!
You 
Yeah.
just want  the job, to suit you  if you wa , if you want to go and pick your kids up from school you'd think that  oh why should we do work today, you know, let somebody else do it!
So I said 
Right.
well blow that!
I said there's a
You gotta take it when it's there ain't you?
That's right I said, you know, I can't understand you!
I says yo you go out to your flipping  eleven pound a week  
Mummy !
Oh no!
and er he gets a thirty five pound a week child allowance on his for his four kids!
Typical innit, though!
That's a   about a  innit  bloody hell!
Paying  they're paying 
 
yeah so
Well you .
so I er  he said er  no he said, it's not that he said  I don't like people to tell me  you've got to do overtime today, he said, I like to be asked!
I said well I'll be quite honest mate, there's two hundred people working in this factory  and I said, if you think that e all the charge hands and the supervisors have got to come down and roll up you lot to get the job done  I said you  turn round and you think if you was in business, whatever it is you like to do, if you're in business and you've got an order and that order's gotta be out by six o'clock tonight  and you've gotta grovel to your workers  otherwise you'd lose that order, I said what would you say?
Down the road mate, I'd get somebody who wants to do the job.
Yeah  that's right 
I said and that's exactly how they are!
I said they aren't gonna put up with  like you!
I said and that's why  cos Paul said to me, he said, I never hear you moan, I said look you won't hear me moan  because  it's not that I enjoy the job  I hate the job  I said I hate the work, and I find it hard work  but at the end of the day  on a Friday, I know that  six o'clock in the morning on a Friday  I can go up to the Nationwide Anglia, slip my card in there  and I know there's gonna be a couple of hundred of quid in there  with the 
Yeah.
tax paid and everything, and I know it's gonna be in there  I said now that to me is worth a lot  I ain't gotta worry whether there's gonna be cheque from   out on my doormat in the morning  or if it's gonna bounce when I put it in  so I sa 
.
as far as I'm concerned 
 
whatever o overtime they sling at me, I'll do  not because I feel like doing it  but I need to do it  there's 
Yeah.
my wife and kid at home!
So he said oh oh said his moan and groan  so he said well I spoke to Blue he said, he's off sick he said and he gets ninety pounds a week for being at home  I've been working here all week he said, for a hundred and forty  so I'm forty pound a week better off than him!
Yes but he's sick!

Well forty pound a week's forty pound a week extra 
Yeah.

That's  
So I said

I said you're not working for forty pound a week 
Jonathan !

Yeah.
and forty pound a week but 
Would you go and check see what the heating's on?
you have to be sick  you still get paid 
The temperature's  
I said you're going about it with the wrong attitude!
Mm.
A lot of people say I'm bloody lucky to get paid for being at home sick!
And that they've got a job.
Yep, I said what are you  
Oh  
I said no I was home sick  and I   in bed like you said I couldn't   who's gonna turn round and say well there are Geoff there's a hundred quid mate
That's it.

I said but you're 
Nobody is!
bloody lucky!
I said that'd do you good to be in business for a couple of years, that'd get you sorted out!
They all think that's like  he said they think oh stand up in the corridor, that's alright, Amy said  if you don't  if you have a holiday, you don't get no money
Absolutely!
Well like they're 
He said they don't know half!
that's what I said to Ron, I mean I've never known  I can't remember the last time I when I used to work for Colin for ten years  trying to get a holiday out of Colin was like trying to get blood!
Oh you can't have two weeks at once you know  but over there you gotta get rid of your holidays before December, you gotta get rid of them otherwise you lose them.
Take them, you've got to get rid of them!
Mm.
In the end I couldn't get rid of them, I had two days off  when I was ill  and I had as holidays  to ge to get them  sort of settled up you know.
To get what?
That's like this woman at work 
To get .
she's a teacher and I think she thinks that teachers are the only ones that work!
Yeah.
Oh bloody hell!
And I said something 
Cor!
to her like erm
Oh yeah .
Yeah.
erm, what did I say?
Something about  oh what did I say?
She's a funny woman anyway, I said something like 
They are  peculiar breed!
I should think  I should think you  it's nice to have the six weeks  ahead of us  and she said  well it's not a holiday!
I thought well I wouldn't mind 
Ooh no!
six weeks of not having to get up and you gotta go.
No, not going into the shop at least, yeah.
Cor!
She said  she said for the first week you unwind, I thought  if we have a weeks holiday that means that the time you unwind you're back to work again!
You're back to work .
That's right.
She said and then I have two weeks  erm  homework to mark  and then we have a weeks holiday  I thought well that's two weeks
Yeah.
holiday 
Cor!
really.
That's it.
She said and then the next week you're preparing to go back!
Well why can't she do that  two weeks marking in that first week she needs to unwind?
Yeah.
And then have a
And yet  another client of mine who's a teacher, she said oh yeah she said it's lovely, she said  I suppose I ought to do the  marking and all that  at the beginning she said but I leave it, she said, and I sometimes do it in the last week.
Yeah.
I thought to myself that's  two different
Yeah.
attitudes really.
Yeah.
Yeah 
Yeah.
isn't it?
No well I 
All they seem to do to me is drink coffee!
That's right.
And then you have a we sorry, I'm sorry I can't do it that week, I've got a weeks holiday.
What again?
I think you have six weeks in the summer, we only get four all year!
Yeah well and think about all the other weeks he gets,half term erm
And weekends.
Yeah.
Get all weekend don't you?
Sometimes we get what they call baker days.
Yeah.
You know, so  they don't do too badly  they do quite well really.
Yeah.
.
Ah I dunno.
But people in a way, make you sick really don't they?
Yeah.
They never
They all sort of 
Always bloody moaning!
and they're all
aren't they?
ready to ta , that's what I said to him  you're always ready to take out hand outs, what ever's there to be handed out, you know.
Yeah.
Cos  that really got up, up my back when the , I mean tho ain't a ba , bad bunch of old boys but  I normally go down  but they they clear and once we've done our work  before dinner break they all clear off  and I go down to the   and then I sort of walk back  more or less behind them  you know, to the  break like  and as I go past the club, I go and wash my hands, they go straight in, I go and wash my hands and I walk past the   and er  we should go to dinner at quarter to twelve  and I go past, it's one minute past quarter to twelve  so cos when we go in there you see  quarter past twelve  due to go back  I always give them two or three minutes  and I say that's it, that's , ah we was late coming in, I said no you weren't!
We was  I said look  I can read a bloody clock as well you can, I said I wa walking behind you down the , you went in the canteen and when I went past it was one minute past quarter to!
So I said you know, the  one minute past quarter to  and there's a sort of quietly  you know  but then you know, just have to grab at
Yeah.
they get excitement out of taking two extra minutes 
Give them an, inch and they want a yard 
I think oh my God!
You know, I, it's so petty that!
That's like Sarah  at work, I mean  she leaves at twenty past five, if she thinks that, she'll leave at ten past five  I mean she thinks you're stupid because she don't always go  but even when she's not going  she 
Yeah.
still goes at twenty past five  so why don't she go at six when we do?
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
And she said she even 
 
taking her home Sarah!
I told her I wouldn't.
Yeah  cos she used to get me t , and then she rang me up one day when I was  and said  dad erm  dad can't bring me round there cos the car's not working, can you come and pick me up?
Yeah  .
She said I'll give you some petrol money, I said I'm not bothered about petrol money, I said it's the fact that I've gotta come round to pick you up, I said I'm not a taxi!
Yeah.
And then  I was late, when I got round there I thought well she'll at least be waiting at the top of the drive, if not at the top of the road.
Yeah.
She weren't there, I had to go round the house knocking on her door and oh 
Yeah.
I was mad!
Yeah.
Well yeah you don't mind giving anybody a lift
No.
if they make their way to you.
Yeah  and she used to be hammering on the door, twenty past five  you know  yeah 
 
but  Mrs  the other day  it was something like  two o'clock, Mrs  said to her, she went to lunch one till two  Mrs  oh have you had your lunch?
She said  no, are you off lunch yet?
She said  not until five past, Mrs  said you can get up them stairs, she said you go at  ten minutes early every day!
She said I'm sure you're gonna quibble about five minutes  lunch hour!
Oh she actually told her then?
Yeah  But bu oh she's just   !
Yeah.
Idle!
Yeah.
I said to Mrs , she said I don't know she's a funny girl, I said I don't think she's funny I think she's idle!
Yeah.
I thought, why should we work to pay her wages?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she don't do nothing!
Yeah.
Yeah  Does she do any hairdressing yet or?
A little bit  but  she really winds me up she does.
Yeah that's how I 
Yeah.
I   !
And then she said to me  Mrs  gives us  erm sometimes an extra ten pound, she gets a Y T S allowance   
Yeah.
and she ooh I don't know I'm gonna have to something to her cos some weeks I get it and some weeks I don't, I said you ought to think yourself lucky you get an extra ten pound, I said, we don't!
I said we bring them, we're earning the money   cos she don't earn her own money does she 
No.
just shampooing.
No.
No.
She said I want to know whether I'm gonna get it regular or not!
I said think yourself lucky you get any extra at all!
Mm  yeah .
And then she said about her erm  Y T S, oh  I haven't got my  bus money back yet  I only get an allowance!
I said well  I never used to get any anyway, and I said I used earn less than you!
Yeah.
You know she cor!
Mm.
I mean 
  
Hand outs  every time!
But they don't know half do they?
That family has more handouts than anybody I know!
And the, what is the the thing what annoys me  is they're working!
Mm.
Yeah.
That is what annoys about it or  fair enough if they haven't got any money they get these handouts   but when they're working and they still get them  that's when I think it's wrong!
I mean we're the mugs aren't we really?
Well course we are!
That's right.
My mo , I think my motto's gonna be, see if you can't beat them, join them!
Yeah.
Yeah.
But that's exactly the same  me and Ady having this bungalow built, I mean  some people been ever so funny.
Yeah.
Wonder why .
Why should you and
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh that's alright 
Been funny?
for you, I said we  worked  you know, we've not been given anything, everything 
Yeah.
we've got we've  worked for.
Yeah.
I mean they get ma , they know for six months, they get married with all the gear, the next year they got a baby, fair enough, that's up to them.
And then 
And then they get divorced!
You know, I mean  we haven't  I ain't got a new car or anything, I've had that 
Yeah.
years and
Yeah.
Yeah.
people do what  you know, everybody's different what they do with their money 
Yeah.
aren't they?
So they think 
Yeah.
just because we  saved for that  that you know 
Well you saved hard for it, so then why shouldn't you have it?
That's what 
I know.
you want to do with your money
I said that to  
that's up to you.
you know   got he  he's quite, he's having it built over here.
He's important 
What?
Sarah!
Oh.
No kidding you, his  is your dad's bungalow, and it's a house!
About as big as your dad's  bungalow!
that's painting the front in.
Oh!
If you look round here cos he's right 
 
opposite us.
It's a concrete slab 
Yeah.
it don't look any  
He put 
at all do they?
No.
Well he's
It is bloody huge, he's had the fireman round there!
I said to Geoff when you get your footings in they do you think to yourself, cor that ain't gonna be very big!
You do yeah.
But as soon as it builds up, you see how big it's gonna be  so I said well that's gonna be like erm Buckingham Palace I should think!
But they haven't  a concrete slab!
Cos he said it's gonna be as big as the other house.
The old house.
And do you know he's getting all 
I wonder how they're doing it?
well he thinks he's gonna get his tiles for nothing isn't he, Geoff?
Yeah, he said I got a thousand pound  well I'll ring around, he said I got a thousand o off my, I saved a thousand pounds on my roof  he said  I thought bloody hell, how much  cost    costing him !
No, but he's, he went to the Ideal 
But he 
Homes Exhibition
Oh yeah.
and course they're doing this new  tiles.
They bought out, this company have bought out a new  tile  and he said they're looking for a sort of nice house to have as a sort of a show house and then  he thinks he'll get them for nothing.
Cor must be really !
Mind you, I mean when we were choosing our bricks  he said ooh erm  he gave  number and that, I mean I know  he's not too bad is he when you want
Oh .
he can help them   ooh you want to ring him a my bricks should of cost  what did he say?
Four hundred or four hundred and  forty or something  erm  and on, I can't remember what he said he was getting them for I 
Two hundred and thirty?
Come from Belgium?
Probably yes.
Yeah.
He told me that.
But Geoff  said there aren't any bricks that are that much money anyway!
So I don't know whether he's right or not.
no.
Cos we 
But we 
rang them up and he was  dearer than all the  blooming  builders merchants!
Yeah.
At least Kevin was saying.
Cos you see we was lucky how we got our bricks  didn't we?
Weren't 
yeah.
we Geoff?
I .
Well how did you get to know about them?
I sold him the car didn't I?
That was it.
Yeah Geoff sold him the car
sold him a couple of cars
and he said well he'd 
Oh.
got a load of brick, where did he have them  
He had it , he got caught  by  he got er
there's like a big pallet all surrounded and he got a big pond down the bottom  it's erm  near  Grimston Common
Oh yeah.
common  and he lived at  Grimston and er  he got this plot  and er what was  right next door to it was a sort of real big old  li like a  French chateau  and he wanted a big ge red  brick Georgian house, a real big one, sort of sitting at the back of this plot  that the owner 
Oh yeah.
had put down the end.
Anyway he got all his bricks and everything  and er  he got all his ideas what he wanted  and then they turned round and said no, we're not gonna let you build down there.
So we bought his bricks.
So he's got all his bricks up  virtually I think he said, but I ain't worried about it cos I'll get rid of them somewhere  and I helped him out, I sold this car and, and told him what I was doing  and he come I've just the thing for you, just  cos  was having bricks like your dad's, the sand grain sort of brick, you know.
Oh yeah.
Ooh he said I've got just the  for you, he said,he said  .
And that's how we got them.
And I di in the end they   the same for them, but  
He and Geoff went over there and loaded them on the trailer .
we would of done it by ourself  sorted out.
Yeah we do a  we went over there and loaded them all on and then got a puncture in the trailer,!
Put them on a  didn't they, then load them  load 
Yeah.
them on  yeah.
Used be able to sit in the car   would be   go up the back don't they?
Yeah.
And I used to load the boot up  and bring them  and load home like in the boot of my car  my Sales Manager said to me the other day, how the hell did you get bright red dust in your boot?
I dunno!
There's all like red brick dust in your boot!
 
Oh no!
Geoff was getting the bricks.
And I had Avenger estate, and I done the same with that  and I got away with it for ages and I   what you want a do, I know what you wanna do  he erm, I mean that's that's really sort of pushing it over the top  but he got a great big sheet of polythene, he went down to ready mix  and had a load of ready mix in the back of this  Avenger estate, brand new he'd only just got it!
And course 
Well we didn't do that but
and then on top of that he took the battery off  Pat's car  and it fell over in the front so all the acid burnt the carpet!
Come back dinner time  and they were saying well no you see you can't just a borrow a car to go to dinner in, yeah that'll be alright man  and I hadn't even been in it  since Roy bought it back!
Absolutely went spare you know !
Sent memos all round, you know  and he called me in the office that day, to say I'm really disappointed in you, I said, what do you mean?
He said well I give you that Avenger estate he said cos I thought you were building your house, that'll be handy for you you know  yeah you did  and you let me down badly!
So I thought now what do I say, do I drop myself in it or do I say well that wasn't , that was Roy, I said well you know I said I must admit I said I  I'm sorry  so erm  then Roy said well that battery he said was me he said I, I borrowed Geoff's car again and look the battery fell over in it so I'm gonna help him  er  then I sa , a piece of that bloody great  went across our French doors and  this, there's a  went across 
Cor!
there  and I went down to the   at    and he said    we got your lintel in mate, do you want to take it?
So I said yeah I can do  so he said bring your van down, so I never said nothing  so Bob said, got any  like your dad had
Oh yeah.
It's for our new one again you see  so I rolled the front seat down  put my brief case on the front seat  so he says, where's your van then mate?
I said it's here!
No, where is it?
I said that is it!
Yo you can't put it in that he said, it's brand new!
That'll be alright  so cos he slid his  my brief case  and er I got all the way home, no problem at all, I'd got newspaper under the back, so it didn't scratch the back  when I come to  come down Mill Road  this lorry's go , I mean I got the tail gate up  and er  I sort of looked in the mirror, I thought oh my goodness my tail gate, I could hear it so   and I braked a bit sharp and that slid down  and scratched along the dash board!
Oh dear!
Trying to get it out , sort of plastic dash went creeeh!

And I got her a box of Black Magic so  that's her birthday present sorted out  so she can eat and drink then can't she!

See my dad likes videos and things like that  but he wa he, I know he likes aftershave, he likes that Old Spice and that so I thought well I'll  get him something like that or  I thought I  sort of saw cos I'm going shopping Saturday, I'm trying to get it all Saturday if I can.
I don't blame you.
So I thought well  if I can  sort of get  think to myself a rough idea before I go  Jonathan's going to Geoff's mums cos Geoff's gotta work all day Saturday you see?
Yeah you said that.
Well that's something to do with they're working this Saturday and then they break up a bit earlier or something.

Something like that, so  I said well that's a  good job I'm going this Saturday innit really?
Yeah.

Mrs  won't be there.
No, she's gone on a trip, Simon called round he just dropped mother off.
Oh yeah she was going with you mum isn't she?
Yeah

Oh!
She isn't bringing the boyfriend is she?
She's not, she  
No she wouldn't would she?
She wouldn't!
No.
Oh perhaps she's gonna try and 
She might want to stay I don't know.

Without anything   almost wished she hadn't of come   
Oh!
We went down this  park cos we wanted to 
Yeah.
and when we walked in she's got her brother and her boyfriend.
Oh!
And they always go on a Wednesday, they never go on a Thursday.
Oh!
I mean that's why we went on a Thursday and they'd changed their   as a chap that seems very strange to me!
Yeah.
Because she knows we go once every you know  every other Thursday at least.
Perhaps she was frightened that  she'd gotta 
Yeah 
see you on your own.
Says she's coming over so what's
Oh!
you never know!
Ooh you ha wait and see  Is Graham at work today?
No, but, well it Tuesday is his day off but he's got late till eleven this morning.

Chris said that always like that Christmas time because  they have the pay talks in January  and they always cut them back   
Do they?
pay talks  yeah.
Oh!
To make them think there's not a lot of work and that you know?
Oh yeah  yeah 
So he said yes you know, they say well if you want to be paid it means  people'll have to be sacked and all this, well you know!
Well yeah that's how they go don't they, yeah.
That's right.
Ooh!
I'm in the infant end today aren't I?
Yeah well I  me and Margaret should be in the hall  but I think they've assumed that there will be less
Can go in the hall can't they?
They can all go in the hall  and then that'll leave me free to go out first like I should do.
Well that's right yeah.
I was told I should lend that classroom to them  I can't ge really get out first  and that should be my turn to be out first today.
Yeah cos I definitely shan't be out first shall I?
No.
No and if not that'll be  Margaret out first, out of the hall, won't it?
Yeah.
I mean she'll be out  two days on the trot.
Yeah and that's not fair, and that's cold today isn't it?
No and you see it's just them two  I think they could put him sort of like in the hall and if there's a 
Yeah.
he  
Ask Eric yeah  yeah cos there won't be that many will there?
Well I wouldn't of thought so, the whole class gonna be missing.
Ooh!

Yeah I know what you mean.
With a load to spare!
Yeah.
Right, and you go inside, it's got  two  floors  each about floors about as tall as our house!
You 
Yeah.
I know.
Not all about that, it was .
one night .
They got a lot about Egyptians though  they got Egyptians
They ain't got  a mask or anything like  Tutenkhamen has, have they?
No  there was only one real mask.
Oh well that's   I've seen  Jimmy.
When do you see him?
In the .
What?
half past eleven  just now  literally just now  and er  and he  basically he don't know about  what he's on about.
Oh no!
Nope, he don't know  erm  what he's saying is
A lovely little man weren't he?
that blokes that's erm  dro been rigging it  who he does the things for.
Why?
Well, because he said  for obvious reasons, he said er  I didn't want  my name and address  mentioned.
isn't mentioned in the papers.
Now he's gonna wish we'd tell him  so he said erm
Well what has he done with it then?
Oh it was genuinely gone  quite genuine, he said  you now, he had a , that we know about  but it had  genuine 
Cor , it didn't do that!
Well there are you  don't go near them.
Well we'll have to get our own then won't we?
So he said   choice  because it was his  property they contacted him  but he said what he's done is though right  there isn't anywhere near that amount!
He said we're talking about eighty or ninety
We're short on twenty two.
We could  we can, ah no  no  in terms of money  he's talking about four or five thousand maximum.
Well 
Where did you  get the twenty two from then?
Cos he told me there's three hundred gone.
Well Jimmy ought to tell her
Well  you know what he's trying to do, he's trying up the claim  so when  back, he's still gonna get the amount that he wants  so he said t to  Jim  something about, he isn't paying the insurance  I said you're joking!
He said I've insured it he said but I ain't paying  as well he said!
If you're getting all the money he said, you can pay the premium!
So erm  they're sort of having a few words at the moment.
Yeah well that don't help with getting your money though does it?
No  and what's happened is, he's been up the bank  and er  the thing has
Saved his money.
and the thingo's gobbled up his card  as he said, well if it hasn't  gobbled your card  then  no problem.
If it has
There's a problem.
we'll have to re-issue another one which could take sort of, you know, this time of year it's over a week  so  he said well it definitely has.
Did he say, I'm desperate for my money!
Yeah  so he said well  what do erm    and he said the woman up there didn't really ask what had happened!
It was A T S.
Why did it gobble his card up then?
Well because A T S  had gone  straight to the bailiff  and the courts  to freeze his account.
Ooh my God!
Mm  because his account was frozen  as soon as he put his card in  it took it in!
Oh!
So he said, can I get a new card?
Could you have that done to you then?
No.
You couldn't have that done to you?
Oh sorry, I thought you said did I have it done.
Well no cos I ain't got one of them sort of cards have I?
His was like sort of a bank credit card  but bank said he put the cheque card in  and that was only a fifty quid thing anyway.
But he 
Alright.
could draw it up to a  a thousand pounds  on that card  I mean 
And you said he's only just paid it, well 
That's what he said, if I'd known what I know now, he said I wouldn't of paid it!
He says I'd better go and check the money  so he said erm  but what he couldn't understand was  they wrote to him and said that  they haven't paid the cheques  but they didn't say anything about freezing his account!
Well they should by law, surely!
Well  dunno.
So he said erm  I said to the woman  I went to the court this morning  so he said   when you explain to me  he said I've got money in my pockets cos I borrowed it from dad  tha he said I owed sixty two pound  so he said I said to the woman   in the  court  how can I pay this  the sixty two pounds  when you've frozen my account?
She said, that's your problem!
He said well it isn't  cos it's your problem  so she said, no I'm sorry, she said, you know it's one of those things!
He said well actually I have got the money because I borrowed it.
So he paid it?
Well yeah  but he said  without this card  he can't get no money, cos he's used what money he had to pay off the card.
  

I don't feel like going up 
 
thingamy tonight do you?
I do.
No.
But we ought to.
Oh!
Well  you're only going to grandma's.

Ahh!
Ooh and that girl who left, what was supposed to go 
Oh I didn't leave till ten past, did I?

Oh!
Why's that?
Come into work  I think it's assumed she'd left  but she didn't leave, she di she had enough of it  so she had a couple of days off  come in this morning  and er  I said to Steven, no idea what the situation was.
Oh!
He said yo it's terrible in here he said, it really is, he said I've never known such catty  in all my life!
What is catty then?
Well   right old bitches they are!
Well they come from the right area, don't they?
Yeah.
Let's face it.
That's right.
You can't get any worse than that can you?
No  cos whenever we go in there  they're always moaning if Cliff starts singing or something.
No!
Oh they go  if he starts singing!
Why!
Cos  singing?
So he dropped a metal pallet on  purpose  and course, it makes a hell of a row!
Yeah  well I would of thought it'd been nice, been nice to have 
Well 
somebody happy around instead of miserable.
Yeah but he, he is rather loud.
Is he always singing?
Oh terrible!
I wouldn't mention it.
I suppose he does it on purpose don't he?
Yeah.
Never mind singing.
I ha I had sort of few, few words with him this morning.
With who?
Cliff, Cliff .
Why?
Cos of that   come in front again.
we do.
I never said nothing mm  cos 
Why aren't you drinking that?
Yeah when I've had this.
I never said anything  then he er  I could see he'd gone cos he just stood there  for about ten minutes like th and everybody else was working, he just stood there like this for about ten minutes by the rack  see him doing nothing  I never said nothing  he come charging through with a rack  and knocked all the pallet over what they just stacked up  with fifty boxes on  so we had to  make that right  and he stacked a load of L T M boxes which are temperamental anyway  and he hadn't pulled the wrap tight so as soon the bloke lift them up with the forklift, they fell all over!
They fell over.
Ooh Christ!
And then I'd  I'd had enough  and then he started messing about and he started pushing the boxes down through my strapper  then, course that messed the strapper up!
So I 
Did it?
I was doing the lift.
Oh!
He said what's the matter?
I said well what you do in your private life it's up to you  if you want to get drunk  and you want to spend money  then that's fine  but once you step over  that clock tower I said and you start interfering with my work it's a different thing, I said well I've   and I've just said nothing because  although you ain't worked right, at least you've sort of you've work in this factory sort of in the morning, you've got over it but 
and then 
Yeah 
 
.
there's been disaster tonight  ain't gonna put up with it!
So what he say?
Didn't say anything.
I said you know, I think you've gotta sort yourself out Lee  and everybody went sort of quiet  but  Paul said  I've never had a rollocking!
I said well in all fairness Paul, you ain't actually  bloody got , I said I don't do it for the fun of it  I said and I don't like doing it  but I see, he just sort of 
Well that's silly comment  can't be doing him any good!
I said well the thing  is discipline.
If grandma went 
If the transport 
into the  she'd  sherry each.
Cor!
I said if the transport get that load of L T M thrown back  Robin is gonna get it right in the neck!
And if Robin gets it in the neck  I shall get it in the neck  and I shall be getting it in the neck because of you!
So I said I think 
Well then what did he say?
I said I can assure mate, I said I shall make sure there's hell to pay!
I said but I shall be wrong  for not saying anything about you coming to work drunk.
So I said I'll leave you to think about that.
Well he must of had that amount  he must be contin , he must have alcohol in the body  continuously.
Of course he has  he was drinking Saturday afternoon to Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and the Sunday night  not Monday night  but  again last night.
So he never gets over it does he?
And he went to bed half past  two.
And got up at four.
Before then I should think, quarter to four.
I should think he looked like nothing on earth did he?
Yeah.
Well he's gonna kill his self isn't he?
That's right.
Anyway he's just rotting his bowel, he'll be rotting his liver next!
Yeah  I said to him   Cliff, I think it's tragic mate!
I said that's none of my business, nothing to do with me  but I said I should think it's a tragic waste for you  and I say, it wastes your money  but that's  entirely down to you.
And what did he say?
Nothing.
He didn't say a word, no.
Well it is a shame innit?
Mm  I mean, you know when he gave up the drink
He was a different man.
he was a different bloke, yeah.
Mm.
And the trouble is you see  they all make laugh of it  old Cliff, old Cliff, old Cliff!
And that makes him worse, really.
Yeah well I said to him, what you don't realise is Cliff  they laugh at you  to your face
But they talk 
at the 
behind your back!
end of the day when you do something wrong they're the first to nip in that office and say what you've done wrong  and why you've done it wrong.
Yeah,.
But I think I shall have a quiet word with him tomorrow morning when I get to work.
Gonna see him?
Yeah.
And say what?
Well, you know  I just can't sort of let it go on.
Well he perhaps won't do it any more now you've told him.
As soon he gets his mouth round a Guinness bottle mate, that's it!.
Well for heaven's sake, how many does he have?
Well it's roughly about five pound and, one pound and  I thought he said one pound forty a pint.
How many bottles does he have?
Well he got through fifty quid on Saturday and Sunday  so that's forty pints innit?
That's twenty pints each day   
What and  forty pints in a night !
No  forty pints in two  like Saturday afternoon and Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and Sunday night, he got through forty pints  or perhaps just under forty pints but that's it.
Well is he an alcoholic?
Well he's always been able to drink like that  he's .
Well he's happy enough behind all this isn't he?
Well  well I dunno.
Well I'm, I must admit I don't know.
But I was   the trouble 
What?
is
He's rotting his stomach isn't he?
yeah I mean, and the trouble is  what  n annoys me more than anything  is the fact that he's good worker  I me even when he's drunk, alright he don't work at full capacity  but he does sort of almost as much as what they do  and when he's 
Yeah.
sober  he can do more than they do  I mean i that ain't the sort bloke you wanna lose, and I'm, when he balls and shouts at them  well he gets on your nerves really  but at the end of the day I'll  you know, I'll put up with it.
You can put up with that, good God!
Yeah because he's a, he's a bloody good worker but  and when he's like  Cor!
And the other morning  disgrace!
The funny thing is, like  there's a beer smell isn't there?
Yeah.
But he has got the sort of  acidy sort of alcohol smell on his breath  just like you'd been on  spirits all night  or whatever, any sort of  you know, wine and  it's not a beer sort of smell.
But I mean he's  I mean Ivan said to me, phworgh, he said when Cliff's breathing over you!
I said I know I said, just like neat alcohol innit?
God he said!
Well I should think  that's   acidity in his stomach innit?
Definitely  and he'll say I've got this pain, I've got this pain, I should think you have Cliff!
Oh it's not that, no it's not.
Where's he get the pain?
In his side.
In his side?
 
I think he's rotting his liver, that's the feeling.
Liver, yeah , exactly.
But you see he's that thick 
.
you can't tell him nothing  he would say  oh no no no, beer's no problem, beer's no problem no  it's not that experience, not that experience, I said well you wanna smell yourself Cliff!
Cor God!
Well I still   alcohol.
it does.
Yeah alcohol  
And your guess is that  he said er  bought something 
Guinness is a heavy drink!
Yeah he's 
That's surprising he don't have such a bad head!
No he said er   
Ah  Cor!
Well fancy being a like that all that time  it's bad enough when you've been out on a binge and you get that headache then.
Chris  Ivan said to me, he said  Cliff wanted us to go and have a drink he said when we've finished work on a Friday  he said last night, I tell you, I said   I said no, no I didn't!
Well how are you all gonna get home?
Oh yeah he don't mean that he had a lot of drink, just have a drink and come home.
I said well I hope you enjoy .
Well it isn't worth it, you can't afford to drink and drive can you?
I know.
Mel's got her lights up, did you see them?
Yeah well   yeah.
Mm  yeah talking about that now he's out the way  basically what he was gonna say was, as simple as this
.
well it don't matter does it?
Oh alright then.
Yeah  no he was just saying that head office  they'll dictate to them like anybody else  so he said  I've got to have  erm  the mortgage up to date for a start before I can consider anything.
I thought you'd done that, you was gonna do that?
Yeah but I haven't  that's what he saying, but he said what I wouldn't do is ju , don't just say right phrum  there's 
What do you mean?
there's a thousand pound he said, you know, if you can make it right  sort of over the next month  but he said basically I cannot do anything until  erm  the end of February, he said you come in the end of February he said and then we can start to sort it out, he said I can't do anything for you until then.
Did you tell him that?
Who?
Malcolm.
No  no point in me  well anyway when she
She'll know.
Mm  so he said erm, that's the situation he said but you can forget your business he said, as far as I'm concerned he said, you've lost for two years so he said consequently he said you're gonna lose this year are you?
I said well I wouldn't be surprised.
So he said well all I can say is he said you wanna just forget that  erm
And just do it on the money you owe on the house.
Yeah exactly  don't get involved at all.
So he said well  how do you feel about your business?
So I said well  you know, I can't just wind it up over the next  six months, I said er  what I wanna do I said is erm  I gotta carry it on for that  transit  for that  Orion till I finished anyway  so it's gotta go another year  so I said well what I'm feeling about doing I said is er  just sort of keeping a finger in the pie  I said, he said, if I'd said tomorrow, if I had finished the whole the tomorrow  I've gotta buy a car  I can buy it finance so I'm gonna get no tax relief on the H P  I get no depreciation  no nothing like that I said so at least if I still self employed  I can  if I have the sort of two or three vehicles or whatever  three, four, five vehicles but I said at least I can have some   erm  and I can then sort of they would be more  utilised, where as I said at the moment  we got more vehicles than we really need to keep full capacity  so he said yeah, yeah fair enough then.
I said well that's what is, I said if you look at it the depreciation is so heavy  compared with the income, and I said and the insurance as well but I said hopefully cos we haven't had any  of er  any claims at all this year  you know, I said I know but all of the insurances of gone up, but I said  I'm hoping that we can sort of get the insurance down if possible  so he said, yeah fair enough then.
He said well from my point of view anyway at least he said just disregard that  completely he said and we will do it on what you earnt, so he said all I can is  erm  just put in as many hours as you can to get your wages up on that side  erm  and then by the time we look at that he said, the end of February obviously you'll have December, January and February which will be good months  there, I said yeah  so he said well then you know  erm  a hundred pound here and a hundred pound here he said, it all helps to keep the figure up for you  so he s 
Yeah but that don't help us with Malcolm does it?
No, but I mean all I can say is basically erm
Give him as much as yo , we can, when we can.
Yeah.
And can you do 
And he said he's quite prepared to do it, he said, there wouldn't be no problem  but he said I cannot do it, he said they are
What, is he gonna lend, what's he gonna lend you then?
About thirty three thousand  but you see what he said is, head office make the rule and he said and  they're not 
No there's no problem  that we can 
No.
have it?
That's right, he said what 
But you can't have it till February.
Yeah because he said as soon as they  see arrears he said they insist that it's paid up  and they insist that you have like  three months  pay them  no problem  he said 
Yeah.
and then there's no problem.
I said no, but he's 
Well we can manage that probably 
Yeah.
couldn't we?
but he's, he give me a a print out, he said well here's your print out look  so he said as soon as 
But you'll have to ring Malcolm and tell him Geoff  because he'll be on the phone to Miriam.
Yeah but she'll know  she'll know that  in fact he'll be seeing her.
Was he alright?
Malcolm or
Yeah  he just said you did say I can have some more money, I said well yeah.
Ah  we ain't   but you must pay your mother too, Geoff!
Yeah  yeah.
And then there's Andy as well.

Cor every time I  paint, it bloody rains again!
Well don't Jimmy   that's what I told.
I tell you what mate, he's a .
Yeah.
Very .
Why?
I should think I'd 
Well
Well they sho 
when they  and they freeze your bloody bank account like that he  I mean, like you say he  it's just daft you can't do that!
They've froze his bank account!
Yeah  now he's stole all them .
Mm  yeah but I should think they're insured for that.
Well yeah but you see they .
They probably weren't on his premises either were they?
Well it's   no.
Jimmy's?
Yeah.
But he was saying you see, what's happened is the  they isn't his  he just delivers them for the bloke
Well yeah.
and they have these bloody great artics come down and put the stuff in your shed  and it was nicked  but he said there's in , there's about  eighty odd  hampers nicked  worth about sort of, perhaps four thousand 
Hey what are they doing ?
quid  but the bloke who  owns them  he's  near said they were sort of a couple of hundred or  three hundred nicked or something  and he put the load in at twenty two thousand quid!
So he said that's all got out of proportion.
Makes me laugh when he comes 
 
Ooh sorry!
He's only insured for eighteen thousand anyway  so I said well to be perfectly honest Jim, I said I wouldn't of thought that the insurance company's gonna pay out eighteen thousand quid without getting some sort insurance investigator down there to  sort it out.
I said they'll want to  know, where they was, how they was  they'll want to know the value of each stuff, what was in it, everything!
It's terrible!
Mm.
They don't know  they isn't gonna just churn out, oh yeah well we'd better pay that mate, eighteen thousand quid!
Yeah well I said to Geoff, well I hope Geoff soon gets his money because he owes Geoff a lot of money at the moment!
. I said well we need that really, this 
Yeah.
this week!
Mm.
Too right!
Oh it's a job I don't know!weekend a day or two ago he did look a bit better tonight.
And the building society bloke's told me today  they've got a hundred and fifty  accounts  in the  office  that are sort of heavily in arrears  
 
That's a joke!
Streuth!
Well we're not heavily in arrears are we?
No that's what he said, he said  
No but you are  but I mean 
We are in arrears but we're gonna be 
he said you are by the number of payments you isn't paid  he said you haven't paid for almost a year but he said you haven't  money.
No  no.
He said well you ain't got much .
Yeah it worked out  what, about nine hundred pound innit?
Yeah.

Well you see nine hundred pound that's only sort of your half yearly rent is it?
Mm  I know.
So we we're not
And that's what we're paying per year  .
Yeah we pay that for a year.
So he said but, he said, the stupid thing is he said, I'm  I could  
That's a bloody good job that is all it is!
Cos I didn't know how we'd of managed if we'd had a big one!
he said it's  it's the twelfth payment which he said is  you know, just pay it I said  
But he said to Geoff  don't pay it off all in one lump sum
Yeah.
He told him not to do that, he said just pay when you got some and 
If you can.

Well Aunt Sadie said a long time ago 
Ohhhh!
there was two of them 
I don't care what Aunt Sadie said, he's had sixteen thousand pounds 
Rargh!
spent on his house and had it all .
Now?
No, this was done a long while ago,
Who paid for that then Geoff?
Well, there's been a court case over it.
In the end  he isn't they who, he sued the insurance company  and this, the er  solicitor he had weren't getting on very good and they suggested this bloke   and he got onto it and he got on it, fifteen thousand quid out of sixteen thousand quids .
Well I know a long while ago 
Good God, that's good innit?
Aunt Sadie said 
better than , yeah.
Who's his solicitor, I think we ought to get in contact with him?
telling me.
But he said erm 
Aunt Sadie said they've had to move out 
   
But she's coming to the
That was nothing to do with it!
Erm
Well that's what she said.
Yeah 
Yeah.
that's what I was saying about Geoff's car really  you know that chap taking it and  righting off  and we didn't got a penny for it, I ca , I can't see how that's right!
And what do you pay insurance for?
Well that's it!
Well erm
Mummy!
well I suppose their motto is, she had a C D ten on her driving licence, I suppose she shouldn't of had it in the first place  so  if she hadn't of had it, he wouldn't of got it!
!
But that still ain't the point!
Geoff did not 
 
hire it to him!
Yeah.
He hired it to her  whether she'd got a C D ten 
Well that's that girl that had the
yeah but  if she'd of had the accident  they could of said  no, she's got a C D ten on her driving licence, she shouldn't have been driving it!
Yeah.
Well fair comment.
Yeah.
But he weren't even supposed to have it, so
No.
that ma , I said to Geoff, to me,you know, we'd like to get a solicitor on it  but you see we 
But you weren't aware she'd, he'd got it was you?
No.
No!
.
Oh well she 
I mean she , she really should of been summonsed for
Well I tell you something, I think you ought to  compile a letter together to somebody, and try and sort some  it isn't gonna cost you nothing to write a letter!
To who?
Well I don't know who!
I just don't know what to think!
I don't know who  well I don't know whether you ought to write to the chief constable and explain the situation, all the 
I reckon she should of 
aggro we've had of   and forms and then writing letters to him 
 
and being lost and
she should of took them keys out shouldn't she?
Well  that wouldn't of helped i 
She had , you see but  see it's like  shall we say  dad hiring a car
Yeah.
pack it up Jonathan before I get bloody cross!
Yeah.
It's like dad hiring a car  come home here and put the keys on the mantel piece
And somebody taking them!
And then me picking up the keys  living here  and taking it down the road!
Yeah well I mean he must have gone in the hospital to her mustn't he?
No , no, no, no  he lived with her  and she, she was 
She di , she didn't ha 
at work.
The car was at home.
Oh I thought you said it was in a hospital yard when he took it!
No!
Oh!
It was in the caravan where they lived.
And he took it.
Yeah but then he knew he had 
Well she must of left the keys in!
No!
No she left the keys in the house.
In the caravan where she wo , lived!
Well I mean she must have left he keys at home.
Well yes.
Yeah but you don't t , if you're not using the car 
As far as I know.
you don't carry a  well a 
ours at home.
And he picked it up 
She'd left them  in the caravan, and he just see the keys
Well that's it, as far as I'm concerned, it's theft!
And that is all
Well it is!
And he was convicted of theft!
He was, see that  they are saying, it is not theft  to be theft 
Well course it is!
he would have to break into that caravan
To get the keys.
and take the keys.
Well then yo , you should have rung her up and said did he break in the caravan?
She should of said yes, and then we perhaps would of got paid out!
He lived with her!
It was his caravan!
Yeah but she'd kicked him out anyway, hadn't she?
No!
Well that's a pity she ain't said she had!
No, they was living together  they'd only been living there a fortnight!
Cos they  
Well I'd I'd I just cannot see how it's fair!
You see
What isn't fair?
who was that man come here about insurance?
He said they're alright
Until you want paying out!
till you want some money
Yeah.
he said, I find mine  just the same, I've dealt with them for years  but as soon you want anything  although, I must say, with the break in  we've got on alright didn't we?
Yeah.
Well that's a different sort of kettle of fish.
when you think about it.
Yeah.
You claimed, both of you claimed  they were straight away gonna chip you back  and offer you about sixty pound for them  .
Yeah.
And if  hadn't of got on the phone and  sort of made a song and dance about it, and told one or two things, and said one or two things  they come up with a bit more money, but again you have to lie through your teeth to get back what you're really entitled to!
Mm, but I mean when I showed that bloke them  first time, when I showed him them  cuff links
Yeah.
he said, now look  you lost eighty pound out of that draw  I said yes I did  they'll only allow you fifty  so he says I'll say  these cuff links are worth thirty pound, so he was on my side weren't he?
Yeah.
He said they won't know no different  he said then that'll rectify you're eighty 
Well that's bloody right,yo 
and he was with me weren't he?
Have you told 
Well I'd 
have you told them  big insurance company  come and unstuck a little and what he had  like Gail done, was like we had last year
Yeah.

Sorry you can't have it.
Well he's moving furniture as well.
Well you said to me he could have it  he said I'll have tonight.
Yeah but he must bring it back by nine!
Why?
I forgot Mr  was having it.
Mm.
So your mum won't be able 
 
to go shopping till nine then?
No.
Well they don't normally go till about nine anyway  well they can't  cos the post office don't open till  do you want a coffee?
No I'll have a cold drink  I don't mind what it is.
Do you know I've been so busy, I done that van this morning, I've done  my housework and two loads of washing  been over Petes'   did I tell you?

Who's is that?
Them ones we got from .
Oh.
Posted them letters did you?
Ha!

Where are they?

Well I'd have done them myself!
Well I got a post office aren't I?
We ain't heard a word from Jimmy have we?
No  I got .
Pardon?
I got .
Why, what you gotta do?
that car back from  Fiesta  got the minibus going out  got the estate car,he and  Jimmy's look, he talks about Mr , he has left that like a tip!
It stinks of  kid wee!
But  to work this morning, I could of done it!
Mum?
I said take the bus.
Yeah but you said you'd be busy!
Yeah but I could of  when I got home!
Now I've gotta do it in the dark!
tell me .
Well the hoover won't , except I had to scrub that mini that erm  that van, it was so filthy!
Yeah.
And now who ?
He did.
Jimmy did.
I wonder where he's getting his vehicles from this week?
He's got his  ain't he?
I thought you said they stopped the ?
Well, he isn't supposed to be using it.
Can I have a spoon please?
The bailiff said he couldn't use it.
Bloody ridiculous that man!
So someone bought the bailiffs in for sixty two quid!
A T S.
Who's A T S?
Tyres and .
You don't owe them nothing do you, I hope?
Nothing to do with A T S, don't like them.
Precisely for that reason I should think!
Well wha what he said was  he went up there  there's erm  could they  put on the front wheels  to the back  and the back wheels to the front  didn't say anything  the bloke said, well we can't charge you.
Oh.
And the bloke said well we can't charge you for that.
So this is isn't what it's all about?
Well, that's how it all come  see he owes them a hundred and seven pound  and er 
 
when he asked them change the tyres over they wouldn't do it.
Oh.
Yeah but they said we can't charge you for it  he said we sell a new tube or sell you a new tyre he said  we can charge you  but we can't charge you labour.
That's ridiculous innit?
Yeah, so he said well  charge me for wheel balancing then or something  no he said, we can't do that.
He's just being awkward by the sound of it.
So he said will you do it for nothing?
And he said it's not a charity case!
Could you pay him to do it?
He says no.
Said fair enough  he said and with that I come out the garage.
Well why don't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use?
He does now.
So erm  he's phoned up me   your money  cos he said they daren't put me in court you see.
Well that's a ridiculous  thing to do!
Well they say they're gonna put you into court, you get it paid don't you, before anything goes further?
Yeah  yeah well you see what he said was  he could not see how they could warrant   him  that sixty odd come as interest   justify doing it.
It will all depend how long has he owed them it.
Possibly about a year I think.
Cor!
My God!
So he said, I'm not having that!
And walked round  ah so they er  got a, sort of court bailiff involved.
For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that!
Cost a lot of money I would of thought.
They obviously don't like him do they?
No  well  erm  it's a big firm so
Perhaps it's  
what they did in  is er  .
Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now isn't he?
Yeah.
It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen.
Yeah.
Twenty two grand!
Ridiculous innit?
The blokes on the make isn't he?
Yeah.
You see he's  and then he had the cheek to charge me for insurance!
Well I expect him to pay the insurance.
Who did pay the insurance?
did, but I  gonna give it back.
Well I should think so,gonna get twenty two grand out of it!
Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he didn't even pay it, I did!
Well actually they erm  I think the  maximum they'll pay out is eighteen thousand.
Yeah but I don't think that's gonna be such an easy case to .
Well, I don't.
You know it looks to me 
They said they'd got it.
they think that it's all cut and dry, well  they haven't got the  then people will come round and investigate yet!
No.
Mum that'll come out on the tape!
Well I can't stop it cos the kettle's boiling!
Don't be silly!
Mum is there any shandy please?
Baby  .
Jonathan put that straight in the bin for mum, will you please?
Yeah.
You yum 
You know 
.
Colin?
Yum.
Who's got a .
Yeah.
he was saying
, they're going to Yarmouth.
Ah!
I see.
that's where they're going  cos he said they  he's not actually for the  itself
Yeah.
it's  you know, for the workers, they're going out on a meal.
So who's paying it then?
He is gonna pay his self.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
Oh that's .
Well they can .
Well I presume so.
What did he er
He ought to have done it through the college  got it cheaper.
Ah oh oh!
He said this is nothing to do with the college.
Why don't he er
Well I suppose he's, the man's got his reasons.
I was gonna say  what you mean, put petrol in it?
Seems stupid!
Yeah cos you gotta lay out money aren't you?
Yeah so if I decide to  
Oh he said, when he's finished  I don't whether he's not picking it up till later on.
Ooh and another  that's what I wanted  to tell you about  well I don't think we can help him out.
Oh well.
Gentleman wanted a minibus
Yeah.
now, he talked rather nice  erm  with having four
Yeah.
I can't remember his name at all I can I can't think of it now.
I'm gonna go and watch T V.
Well what he wanted, he wanted a minibus from there  to there and there  well we can't can we?
We can have one from there  to there  but he can't have one here.
Daddy, mummy 
Can he?
thinks the key was down 
I 
the
Jonathan I don't really  
Just a minute Jonathan , let mum   because the college has got one there
Yeah.
Toby's got one there  and  got the other one there.
Yeah.
Well what time is Toby coming back?
Well so he can't have that one then?
And the  Isle of Ely college is going out for a meal, so that won't be back, so he can't have that one, so we haven't got one!
No.
For Friday night, but he can have one  sort of, first thing Saturday morning.
But otherwise we haven't got one.
No  er 
erm, and that lady's gonna ring about the Fiesta 
 
and then that young boy's gonna ring about the van.
Hooray!
But that means that won't get cleaned outside for Mr
  

Mr .
Well but it's  very clean inside, I scrubbed it.
Mm.
And polished it.
Mm.
I wouldn't of thought he'd of worried too much about the outside.
Well it isn't that bad, it's only down the bottom anyway.
No, under the right hand side, there's none the left hand side  Well I said I only washed 
 
one side.
I started washing my .
Who turned the light out?
I did!
Why?
Well that's gotta be back by nine in the morning.
Yeah.
As long as he's got that back in the yard by nine.
Well I did see him, he seemed alright  but you see you can't tell what people are like,yo you may think they have  ni 
I know.
nice personalities  but he could  now do a runner with our van couldn't they?
Yeah.
I reckon that's what honky tonk was on the other night though.
Yeah.
Was he?
I reckon he's in trouble.
Yeah.
So  let me just think.
So well, he could have the van  well how much would you charge him for tonight?
Twenty quid.
Yeah cos Mr  's got the Renault.
I told my mum  
Oh  in  decent state  he didn't last time I scrubbed  well I wou 
go on Monday?
No.
Oh.
Yeah well they sho I said I'd  I was looking through this
Mm 
and I was thinking cor  we say we haven't been doing very well, but look at that week there!
And then  look  it's not 
Yeah.
too bad for this time of  I bet we're doing better this year, this time of the year than we did last.
Yeah  .
Well you see you  do that minibus want cleaning up, that blue one  or was that clean before we put it in the shed?
No  that's  part of the   the windows washing but I'll  quickly washed over them  just to spruce them up a bit but I thought if I put Mrs  in that, is she driving, or is she not?
Erm, I should imagine so.
Yes, she is.
Is she?
Don't she like the column change?
No.
Oh God!
Well I can't help it.
Well you'll just have to explain to her, the other one
Yeah.

Yeah,.
Well you  with his money you can pay off them two bills.
Yeah.
Cos yo you don't put them through do you?
His?

No.

Well then forget about this time, that won't hurt will it?
We've been doing alright otherwise.

Pete was talking about his  Roly  he said  June, he said  he is such a character!
So I said, is he?
So he  he's been up  he's one of type of dogs, he said like a human  you wouldn't know if he went in the house they wouldn't know whether he was coming out with a double barrelled shot gun to shoot yourself  or 
Yeah.

He said he's 
Yeah.

No.
As we was just coming home.
She stood there  yabbing at the end of the counter, when are you coming out!
He said oh for God's sake shut up Kim!
So she said er  shut up your fat    !
She didn't!
He said I've told you before he said, if you ever say that again he said I was gonna knock your head off!
And anyway I  walked past him and he went back and he was sh moaning at her  so erm  two of the old boys he'd been working with said whatever's all that about?
So there.
I said oh another one!
I want well out of it, so course she come in  got changed, so he said to me I would like you tomorrow  to have a word with Robin  about stopping her coming down  to us he said because erm  it makes me feel very uncomfortable he said  and we had that hassle he said  it's a load of nonsense he said  I've forgotten 
Well I suppose it does make him feel uncomfortable.
Yeah  he said I've forgotten about it  Blue's forgotten about it he said, but she won't let it rest he said  he said it's Well she's a child, she's only a child Geoff that's 
Yeah.

Yeah he said I'm not having he says.
She's like a spoilt child, she's gotta learn to
Yeah, he said 
from there soon.
That's what he said, he said she can throw a tantrum he said and get everybody sort of feeling sorry for her he said, as and when she wants he said.
Well I suppose it probably wasn't tha , a complete pack of lies Geoff.
Yeah  so he said I I want ca , Robin to stop her coming down here he said.
So you've gotta be the one who tells him.
Yeah  so Ivan said 
Well I think he's right.
yeah, so Ivan said to me, he said er  he said well I do I suppose you have noticed he said but whenever she comes down here he said  the whole line stops  I said I quite agree  I said well let's be honest about it if he's knocking out the meat he , it's gotta stop  cos he  stops 
Jonathan !
he stops talking to, stops to talk to her I said and obviously if the meat isn't coming out the box, the meat isn't coming out of the box!
Well that's right.
Well that is right innit?
Yeah.
But she's like a child really  you gotta pity her really haven't you?
Yeah.
But the point is, why should other people suffer  her.
Yeah.
You know, they shouldn't have to should they?
No.
All that  worrying!
Terrible!

I said well I'm not bothered what other people do, I said they can 
Well if he was tidy you wouldn't have a job would you?
What?
