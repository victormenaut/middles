That'll be forty five in a 
That's a good idea 
yeah 
aha
erm, if you leave that on there
mm, mm
should nee stand now
I should imagine it should stand normally, just like 
er 
anything else  
I'll just leave it on here there
there you are
see, but if ya, er put it on your person she says, you daren't put it near your throat because
No cos, oh yeah 
the sound 
yeah if 
you are 
if I  on
aye
and
so 
put it anywhere near here
yeah
I should imagine
mm, mm  but er  in the morning I surprise because when I knock your door and I got up early, I got up at half past six cos 
Mm 
quarter past nine cos er  me and Billy wanted to get our oil into a,
Aha, aha, aha 
so he says Covent Garden doing a, quarter past nine, so I says oh aye I'll be up ready
mm, mm
so when I got up half past six  and I got shaved now at last, gonna go and get ready and pull the curtains back, oh what a  of rain, I says oh I says 
I've never seen such worse terrible, absolutely terrible
I says I daren't fancy going out in this  I went upstairs and er, it's always the same innit?
I got upstairs and the phone ring I says oh 
 
I says that's gotta be Warren, it couldn't be anybody else, so when I come down  I went off like, well I tell ya I can't do it, so I knew it was  so I picked up the wrong  she says oh I'm just ringing because  you can see what the weather is she says and you couldn't go and do a day in erm, with your 
True, true 
you know
mm, mm
so, so she says I'm gonna go down to Presto, Billy's gone to fetch Wally's pay slip
mm, mm
and he meet me at Presto and we'll get your stuff and we'll get our stuff out the same time erm 
That's just what you will dreading us speak 
Aye 
about don't you?
so he says we're gonna do in dirty weather
Oh what you do in the cold, oh that was grand 
oh aye, oh he's says oh  
aha, ya who, well that was fine
so she says I'll be  quarter past nine and you know by er  you know
mm, mm
yeah
and just turned nine, knock on the door, opened the door, gee and I said the umbrella with the rain and the wind blowing, she says there's more of this,it's not like that
No it can be one of, like one of those
aye 
you know with the squashed
yeah
little 
mm, mm
well when I went to get  pulled him inside 
 
it isn't, it isn't
ah yes
love  
 
and just pulled her along 
it's a waste of time taking an umbrella  anyway 
Aye, so she says I don't think I'll bother I just put it in a bargain 
mm, mm , mm, mm
and er, anyway  she got me walking out and she says er, see you when I come back, that was er  about twenty past  that was twenty past eleven wasn't it?
Came back  door, I opened the door and er he had a big holdall you know
Ah great
right on top of the 
yeah
all the, er, my stuff
mm, mm
although I didn't get many  sixteen and er  he was hovering there, I says well what's happened?
Oh he says oh me knee's gone  and he and he  with his trouble
oh, he was soaking and she was soaking, they come in, she had er trolley and he had er
Bag
that big holdall full of er 
mm 
full of  stuff, and er she had the trolley and two er plastic bags you know those 
yeah 
plastic bags and he had a plastic bag and that when  and she had the trolley with all that in, so well loaded up, you know
I can imagine
and er, anyway he hobbled in, oh he said, me knee, hmm, anyway sat with him and had a cup of tea, she didn't have nothing to drink like and er, anyway  we had our tea and he hobbled in to the front room,and er   and er, she says well you bugger you are, er batter mixture up for ya
Oh for the Yorkshire pudding?
Aye and you forget the, er Carnation Milk for ya, fruit er 
Mm, mm 
and er  s got a nice bit of cheese and er plastic  
mm, mm 
cos have cheese on the  you know er, on the cool counter you know that's how they sell it 
oh yes 
I've tried every cheese they've got on here and there's nay taste whatsoever
see, that's it
the Red 
mm, mm
er Red er Leicester, I got a lump last and there was no taste at all and on the second day, we not having a proper fridge just er, a a fridge you know keeping it in store 
aye yes, that's when you miss that fridge 
the cheese just went dark brown
well did
so I says the only thing that'll be is to er toast cheese on toast 
mm, mm 
you know
yeah
cos I didn't fancy eating it like that and er she goes, I told her give us a piece of some of that wrapping you know 
yes 
with the hard cheese, sealed with the plastic
mm, mm
so there's a nice bit there, so ninety five or ninety six pence
mm
you know this is  so  she says oh I'll probably see ya, er one night she was er cutting all the  up for the rest of the week like, she said do you want a bet on the  the big race this Saturday?
Oh I said ooh I can't ee fancy nowt you know, the weather and the  he said well if you just want one on, have a want, and, I said well I didn't wanna put you, you know  you know go and put the bets on it
That's true
so I said well I wanted to put one on it oh er 
ah yes but it was waiting for him to see you 
and with me not
ah
and he would me have one and you know
that's it, yeah 
ah you know I thought to myself oh
I should have a bet to
yeah
I might phone him in the morning
just ask him
before he comes along and er  ask er to put me one on and I can give him the money in the bet,
good thinking
cos he goes about quarter to twelve
mm, mm
cos I'd hate to think she wasn't having that little flutter 
yet you probably put her off for putting the bet on cos you were 
Me, er no what?
putting it on, that's true
And er so I said oh aye, I said I want, it's only er fifty P a quid on a, a new  
oh well that's neither here nor there so treating
last year I should of had that winner, I picked a  and it won 
oh yeah,
it won the race at nine to one, I could of had it, you know, it's in the race this year
well it's not much  is it a pound?
you cannae fancy it this year, you know
You know
I couldn't fancy it this year, you know, but er
yeah
apart from Red Rum you very rarely get a horse that'll win a two 
that'll hold 
two year you know
mm, mm
in a trot  but er I might just have this and none of them would win, I've only, I would only praise them guessed up or  that way or 
can imagine, yes I can well imagine 
  
yeah  
it was, you know, when, when she says, we are, we're got to do any, he didn't to 
 
oh I says you know  I was hoping she was gonna, you know 
aha mm, mm, oh that was good of them then, mm 
sure you know er gotta give praise where it's due you know 
oh yes you've gotta actually I think they've been very good
yeah
I mean er considering 
and 
they're not really any 
no 
relation to you 
no 
I mean
and she didn't take any money
She didn't?
No, I check the 
Aha
and
mm, mm, oh well it er and maybe the penny's dropped
Well maybe well, with er Billy 
ah that's sort of 
with him being  you know 
it's, probably he doesn't know anything about it
yeah
you see
so
oh well that was good, I'm, I just thought though yesterday when I got up and I've seen the weather, good grief Jimmy's never gonna go out in this like you know 
Well I open the cor when I look I says oh dear you can't do er in this oh it was lashing, the rain was lashing against the window 
Yeah, mm, mm well you cannae put an umbrella up or anything
No you can't 
cos er, it's, it's just a waste of time
I didn't fancy getting soaked, not after getting, just getting over the flu 
With you just getting rid of the flu, hardly 
I just don't seem to be quite right yet though
can it there's 
so 
people in the hairdressers this morning was  
I'd been up 
you know I couldn't get rid of it 
mm 
so  
there's four men who've had a dull headache and they cannot er you know 
mm, mm 
you just cannot seem to get it out of your
that's what I said 
system you know, it's so, it's still hanging around in ya
mm, mm
you know, er, I don't think salt and food help
oh well it doesn't does it?
either what you do, now what you do
This is the thing 
you do not what's been wrong, what's been wrong 
exactly 
so I mean er, you know 
because let's face it, what suits one doesn't always suit another 
No 
I mean I could say well I could go on a diet, but, er and keep on this sort of thing like Margaret does you know 
Yeah 
but, erm, you see the point is that you're not, what suits one doesn't suit another
no  another thing an'all  we are sat here, you know, in the corner near the fire 
Aha 
I'm sure I'm getting a lot of fumes coming back out er 
you said that a couple of weeks ago
I mean  yesterday after I had me dinner I dropped off to sleep for a couple of hours cos 
that could cause feeling  
and you're awake now
mm, mm
Last night  I was sitting er what was I watching?
Forget what was on now
It was that murder mystery thing on last night wasn't it?
Er,that was interesting that, that I, I liked that, him good that  
Oh, I missed it, I knew there was something, that's when I fell asleep 
mm, mm
I fell asleep just after eight o'clock and I was er, well after ten when I woke up
mm, mm
and I was saying to myself, why should I be dropping off to sleep like this, it's gotta be fumes you know
mm, mm
like Jimmy next door, he's always dropping off and he got a vent put in at the bottom of his door, they took the pipe  out and behind  you had a big open
yeah
which should of been bricked right the way in
that one's got a brick opening like that, that isn't bricked in
No, well that's supposed to be bricked right in, so it doesn't allow the fumes to accumulate inside 
it's it's a good size  as well 
Yeah 
that size
and that's what they've done, all then that  done ripped it 
mm, mm 
they clamped a big label on, well they didn't clamp one on ours so I take it was 
mm, mm 
supposed to be alright
mm, mm
but over the years you sit there and ya  you know
well it must be the fumes
yeah
and what this thing up  what's that up there?
in the summer it doesn't happen.
Well that's supposed to be a vent 
Er, that's the vent is it?
it carried the fumes away
Oh I see
any surplus fumes around
aha, have, have you got one like that?
Oh aye but when the bloke went next door to Jimmy's, he, he said where's your vent and Jimmy says there it is up there, ah, and he got up there
I thought
he says I see you've got a towel up there
mm, mm
regarding a fire it's no good whatsoever, he says your trouble you're not getting a draught from your
yeah, aha
from your front door coming through and carrying the fumes away 
cos it'd have to be circulating around wouldn't it?
this part of the fire, he says, Jimmy says well I'll put a label on it then, well  why don't ya?
You're supposed to break a  
well that's commonsense 
he said well that's the trouble you could break the 
I would say that's dangerous 
then he says you want a vent in the bottom of your door 
Door aye, erm
so when, when they came the three of them
mm, mm
Ginger
mm, mm
he had a lot to say and Jimmy lost his temper with him, you know, and he said look,
I'm not surprised yeah, mm, mm
forget it says
mm, mm
on your way he says, I'll get the job done, pay for it and I'll phone you up and you'll have to pay me
oh, ee
oh that'll be a different kettle of fish 
and er 
wouldn't it?
Hmm, he's wife says, he says, ooh, er, she was  when he, went in the back  says I'll be honest, yeah he says you're minding the right , ooh he says er they wanna get erm you know and  
mm, mm 
so he went back and he says er, oh he says er  he says oh dear like, he says well carry on he says  I'll have to take the door off, so he says can you give a hand to hold it, cos he had to cut er  this er like and all grown  at the bottom of the door you know with
mm, mm
six inch 
put one of them metal things in
and you put a grid on each side like a plastic grid, you know 
oh yeah, mm, mm I know
and there was only these er little screws, more like a nail with a, a little spiral on
mm, mm
and what you doing, you didn't screw them in you just break them in
oh yeah
and the spiral grips the wood you know
mm, mm
so he says I tell he says, er, he put the card up where the machine is, which he bore a hole in, I've got one of them mach er cutters, you know, a, a saw with a little braid on
oh yeah
and you can cut all different shapes you know 
mm, mm mm, mm
and he, when you drill a hole in the corner  each corner and he just put it on he just oh it were real lovely and it was as simple as that
ah yes yes, yeah, aha 
he didn't clear, clear the hole or nowt he didn't
mm, mm
when he put the grid in that, that caused 
I see
you know, took an hour down and he just got that done, but I, I've meant to ask him if those have made any difference, you know, having done in 
yes 
the, griding that brick in
mm, mm
but er, that is the trouble, half of these are not been put in properly and the fumes are coming back over
well it, it could cause the  many a  couldn't it?
and that's, I'm sure I put  over the years
Mm
where you're sitting in and she used to nod away 
I know she used to say that
aye, and er, when you wake up ooh you're  your throat's pouring, you're hot you've gotta get up 
Stands to reason doesn't it?
and stand at the back
That's right
the, you know to cool off  what I do know before time, I woke up  er  phew the  you know
mm, mm
and lovely, I just woke up, er a couple of minutes before then the insurance lad come  cos when I only, he should of come yesterday and I waited in but I couldn't, you know when I opened the door I says  I, I he says, you know  
aha, mm, mm 
where you been, I says where you been, aye he says aye he says, my fault he says I didn't get round did I?
So, this tiler were there with that you know, I says well why, you know  and er  I went back in and I turned the fire off altogether
Well it's sensible cos it's certainly  
cos it wasn't, it wasn't that cold you know in the room, so I says well I, I wanna create more fumes, which one am I locking up?
it seems fairly warm  I still think it's nice and warm
Well you don't get much draught cos the fr well the front door see that's the  door here
yeah, mm, mm
you come in our front door there, that was a passage, when you get a draught from the front door, it passes this door and it goes straight to the back, down the stairs and back 
it's what you call straight through to the very end of the  mm, mm
you see
mm, mm
door, one door to another door
that's right
you get a straight through draught, from the front door through the passage, then it doesn't  into here
not do
and then it goes through to the back, now his, although it looks
similar
the same as our house  when you open the door here
mm
his front door, the same, you've got er the stairs going up there
mm
but, when you go into the passage  his door, he's got the door into the front room, same as ours, on the left, but when you get into the bottom of the passage, there's a brick wall in front of ya, and it comes round and his door to the back dining room is on this side here
oh yeah, mm
so he doesn't get a straight through draught like me
no you not do
by having that wall at the bottom 
that's right of course 
the draught always follows where there a, you know, two doors
mm, mm
two windows open
that's true 
but when ya, when you stand at the front door and er there's a blower breeze  and it's cold, if you put your hand round the door like that, you can feel a draught, you can feel it colder than the  you know and the letter box, the draught  but if you take that and put a curtain up, it'll keep the cold out, you've stopped the draught so you're gonna win 
The draught from that's, yeah so you're not sure whether you're doing the right thing or not
Yeah so you know 
so it's true mm, mm
I said I dunno what to do for the best so, I just leave things the way they are and er hopefully that er you get some warm days where you needn't have the fire on, so you don't have fumes you know 
true mm, mm
if 
well you're better again Jim, you've got the fire er so you put the fire, you put the fire off, well this central heating comes from the back of that fire doesn't it, so if you've got the central heating on and you've got it on full 
Aye 
blast for the water, won't you get the fumes just the same as what you do from the fire?
No, because because the fire at the back is  actually at the bottom of the chimney 
Ah I see yeah, yeah 
if this here is in the room innit?
mm, that's right
So you'll have fumes 
of course it is that's right and so, where the fumes from the central heating 
coming back through the side here 
go?
By the side here
They got your central heating for your water
Yeah
in, behind the wall there
yes of course that's right and that's in the front 
you know the fuse 
it's come  
oh your fuse is all at the back the 
yeah 
pull it up the chimney
mm, mm
now that's the difference
yeah
I mean
that's right
you can
it's er coming into the room isn't it?
you can tell er what a draught is like in that room, I shall tell you when  comes
Mm, mm
and they'll be here half an hour or three quarters of an hour, he smoked four cigarettes, now it takes all day and all night to get rid of them fumes of his cigarettes
mm, mm
they travel up the stairs  your, you knew this room and when, with being in it all the time you, you know you, your nose gets  
mm, yeah 
well if you went out the back for ten minutes
and it's strong
and you come back, er and you come back in here you would smell it again
that's right, of course you would, mm, mm
and that's how you can tell there's no draught because the smoke can't go out anywhere
mm, mm
it's trapped, I mean I, I open me front  erm front window 
aye, yes
and I opened up back
mm, mm
two of the, two of the little window
yes
and I left the door open here 
mm, mm that's the only way you can get 
to try and drive 
mm, mm
but even , it took all day to er, to get a 
mm, mm
there was still that  little smell of that, it's 
yes 
got a funny smell that smoke you know 
I hate the smell of it 
er, er the cigarette, tobacco an'all 
I hate the smell of cigarettes since I've packed in smoking I cannot stand it
it's got a funny
mm, mm
smell now, but er I can't understand  how  the war and the would cigarettes years ago, you know, and they start that
yeah, yeah
get it  and er they've brought the full  and then they say if you must smoke, smoke then with a filter tip one and that 
that's right 
will half, chop of the nicotine and whatever you know  
mm, mm 
just, but that wasn't good enough  the bloke that wrote in he says oh later on, er even the filter is no good
that's right cos, yeah, the  if you take 
you'll still get cancer 
er the cigarettes to bits that's black inside 
yeah you'll still get it to you, you'll still get cancer with it cos er, it's coming through and you're still getting it on your chest
mm
well you cannot win
mm, mm
no  if I remember rightly, during the war when the only cigarette that had the filter and it wasn't a filter, oh it was a
You'd have to suck
yes, that's right
no, it wasn't a filter, all it was on the end of a cigarette what you put in your mouth, it was a cork tip, but there was no filter, no filter inside it, the tobacco come right to the end
that's right
all that cork tip was for was to stop it on your lips 
stop it sticking to your lips yeah that's right,
cos you know er  you know 
yes, that's right I think it were the first ones to come out  
really, yeah er, er  introduced er later on, but the one filter all it was, was a cork tip
yeah, mm, mm
you know
yes that's right 
I'm sure have it, as time's getting on the  they seemed to be introducing more  health things in  I think that now that, tobacco er vegetables all the likes of that  is different now what it was forty, fifty years ago
Oh  
because they're treating all these things that we are eating
mm, mm
drinking
mm, mm
er what people smoking and treating 'em all with these new chemicals and that's what's doing you the harm
aye of course it is
er I mean we smoked  before the war
of course I mean that is 
there was me  why now?
mm, mm
why are people being spoke  it's because they know at the end of the day it's what they're bombarding all these things what we are 
it's a shame mm, mm
taking into our bodies with and that's what's causing all the trouble 
you see it all stands to reason 
you know last week when I said that Margaret had  food  you know what it was?
Could of been allergic to something was she?
She'd had some tomatoes and er she never washes them all she don't do that 
Oh yeah, aye, aha 
and  it was later on when she'd had a couple of tomatoes .
and she couldn't realize how she come out in these  she went to the doctor and he says well you must be allergic to summat
mm
and she couldn't think what it was and she got a  as well, she says er  have you eaten any fruit or tomatoes or any, oh she said tomatoes she says did you wash them?
She says no, I just, you know
mm, mm
she said well it happened to me, it's the chemicals on the skin of the fruit and the tomatoes, that's what brought your spots on  and after a couple of days or whatever they went away.
mm, yeah
Aye
well look at some of the apples you were getting round about Christmas, they had brought them in, they had polished them and put that spray on to make them look shiny
yeah yeah 
that wax, and erm, I mean they were, they'd brought them in before Christmas so that they could sell 'em
mm
if they'd keep for Christmas that's why they charged so much for them, those Mackintosh reds and that, and I mean it told you then in one of those magazines that were, John was reading that he said make sure that you wash those apples before you eat them.
Where has those tomatoes gone, if you remember them, they used to be big ones an'all they were 
mm, mm 
a deep red
they were nice, they 
and the skin you just had to press the skin and, and the oh  it was all, you know you could just
eat it
eat it just the way it was 
oh 
with a bit of salt
but they're not like that now
what's hap the tomatoes you can't, the tomatoes you can't, they're hard
mm, mm
you cut it through with a knife
mm, mm
and underneath the skin it's got another, like a skin and neither would 
exactly
what's happening with the tomatoes is that  tomatoes where they gone?
mm, mm, mm, mm I cannot er, the stuff's not the same as it used to be nowhere near 
you see it's got no, they're telling you this and telling you that, it's them that's doing this but they're creating more food, food by, to create more food they're bombarding all your food with chemicals you know all sorts you know 
yeah 
the food and it's not doing you any good
of course it's not  of course 
I mean you cannae go and do, know that a, a decent er banana, apple
there's nothing in the taste 
what's happened to all the, the stuff in, you know you could pick them up and  just eat them straight away 
yeah 
and you know you cannot er  I mean er  it's having to 
of course it is, apparently say what they like about the Green Party but at least that's one thing they're doing something 
I mean  something major 
but they are cos they can't 
why don't they just let the stuff grow naturally?
mm, mm mm, mm 
I mean that, that have to hold top and bottom, you put something in the soil and it gets all its nourishment in the soil and that
mm, mm
and it grown and that's it, no, they've gotta bombard it with chemicals and all sorts, they want more and more  but what's the good of producing more and more, but all these people all over the world dying of hunger
of course 
and what happened
mm, mm
they produce more and more and there's more then wasted and thrown in the bin and it's 
 
on the
mm, mm
on er, these  of bruised fruit 
oh that's true 
and nobody's getting it and, and the worst war shall why, why me water, gonna waste water
that's a fact
yeah
that's true 
plus the price of it,I mean, you know 
but you know that er our Susan wanted to go down to erm, get her hair done this morning so  erm I says to her come up here, we'll get a taxi from here we'll go down the hairdressers and shall  permission to  to collect our money, so  we got a taxi from here down  to erm  what they call that street where er that erm  oh dear me  Street
Aye so you went with them 
so you have to aha 
oh
so you had to go right round and come down the mud down 
yeah 
Street that was er
mm
that was cut off there anyway to cut a long story short when we got down there I says to him what's the damage?
And he says erm  er, one pound eighty and I says to him what?
He says one pound eighty, er  paid him like and erm, you could of  a tip 
mm 
I tell ya, so I think we got out, we got our hair done and she wanted to go down to the mission so the hairdresser phoned a different taxi, we have this one up here, he took her down from there to the mission, cos he went down the back ways, you know,
yeah
which was quicker, took her down to the mission, she stayed in the car till I went up to the mission to get our money signed for our money and come out and er 
yeah 
he brought us straight back here, so we got to the door, I says well how much did he say?
Cos I got out and opened the door 
mm 
she says three pound fifty, I says what?
She says three pound fifty she says that was from taking us down from there and sitting waiting, well I mean I was only in about, well I wasn't in five minutes
So you paid one eighty to ?
three pound, aha 
And you paid three fifty from, you know down and back up here?
aha
Yeah well, well, well from here to  Street it's what  four hundred yards?
mm, mm, mm, mm
Four, four 
yeah 
hundred and fifty yards
so it just shows you, it started off at one pound twenty on the meter that was 
mm 
when we first went down
yes
and I, I mean Jimmy it was only last Friday I went down to have me hair done and I walked from the hairdressers down to  Street to get the wallpaper
yeah, mm, mm
erm, so I couldn't carry the wallpaper so the lass says well you can't carry it, she says I'll phone you a taxi, I says okay, so she phoned this, she says any, any particular one, I says I'll have that one beside us like so phoned association, they'll be erm, you, you know  call up and they came and er pick me up and brought us back with the paper, he charged one pound twenty and I'm saying to myself one pound twenty, that's a damn disgrace, by hell I'll not get that taxi again 
mm 
but you see they must of gone up
oh they went up last year, er, I just forget now, so much on the mile er
