There was a horse running round and we got held up with traffic.
Where at?
There'd been an accident right outside  Park, anyway there was some lad, I don't know was he, is he or what, but he's on a horse and it's only a baby, and I think it's thrown him and there's 
Ah 
all bit and everything's come out so of course the horse is running around free and he's trying to catch it 
he's trying to catch it spooking it even more and
A woman with a Jag parked in the middle of the road and a caravan and what have ya
so they're trying to corner it and it's munching on grass quite happily, you could see it was watching a minute, but it was watching them away and I think er any minute it's looking out the corner of its eye and then it's just gonna go when he sees it getting closer.
Do, shall I get one of these for David just to jot down the hours?
Yeah

Oh I know
Yeah.

Sixty four P, there on the top shelve in those brown baskets, cos there's the set of, there's the three at the top and three in the middle

I suppose they're er, they'd be quite nice with jam on, I didn't like them without 
Yeah they are they're just like scones.

It's raining now  does that lorry  talking to me er like cos they come down this way  going to Eccleston  like two lorries and said there's two cars
Go on.

Possibly, yeah 
Why don't you put your handbrake on, it'll be much easier.
With your dad yeah, yeah cos it's now we've got to order red paint, he didn't get any red  because he didn't honestly think, well it didn't, he didn't know he'd need it 
I should think it's not like, realized.
Maybe he just didn't think when they showed him it, that it wasn't the right one cos I suppose if you've seen them every day you don't, it doesn't register  it's just the fact that of course your dad only  gave him the price of the blue and white 
When I 
I doubt that she'll do it until you've got through your exams 
Wouldn't matter if it was a round number, but forty five.
Well if, you're allowed to earn forty nine ninety nine, before you pay tax and national insurance

It's a shame innit?
You know, there's nothing you can do.

Come back tomorrow.
From Scotland!
Mm!
All on my own, still working!heaven!
Nice for a change innit?
It's alright first couple of nights, but then you get a bit bored 
Yeah.
after a while!
No.
Oh well!
At least I've got a skirt.
Yeah.
Well go back and get those other things.
Erm  well even if I get, well if I get  erm  ski pants
Yeah!
well how much will I have spent then?
Well you've got eighty 
Just spent twenty two pound haven't I?
Yeah.
There.
And  erm  and the ski pants were twenty five pound  so, if I spent twenty two there, and twenty five that's forty seven.
That's a Creda  a hundred and fifty nine.
Well that's alright.
That one's the same make.
Yeah.
I like that.
Yeah.
It's got two bits  
But you, you know what ca cos wo he won't be able to repair it will he?
This is nice!not gonna go wrong.
Well it's made in Britain, I wonder who makes it?
British Steel?
Don't know.
No.
Does it look about the same size as my other?
Yeah.
I think they're all standard are they?
Yeah.
That one's, I think that's a bit wider  that one.
I was gonna say, does that look wider?
It's the only one, really, that's all white.
All white.
Apart from the   and that's hundred and seventy.
It's a Phillips.
But even that isn't really a bad price is it?
No.
It's not bad, no.
It's the Phillips?
Yeah.
That I can get repaired, rather 
Ah!
than just  erm, I like, reason I'm going for that one is my washer  is very similar looking
Yeah.
and it and it, you know, it's about the only one that looks anything like it.
Mm.
Yeah, well I'm su it's made in the U K isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean it's got to be  the other, of course will be  probably  it's  a good machine.
it's getting parts and everything 
Yeah.
int it?
And then, you can always take out the extra insurance with er, no but it isn't very much for a tumble-drier, for five years  and there's no problems that way.
Absolutely none!
No.
Yeah.
And wha what do you do like, about, buy now, and pay July, what does that entail?
Well what that means is, first of all it's no deposit
Yeah.
free delivery
Yeah.
and then erm  in July, you do you don't have to pay out a ha'penny till July and you can either pay cash and get your sixteen percent off free  or you can pay terms from July.
Oh!
Yeah, well I'll probably pay cash, it's just that electric bill's and gas bill's in.
Yes I know.
I know !
And I, if I pay cash I wouldn't, you know,
Yeah.
I'm wondering if I'll be a bit short.
Well, well you can always pay with terms if you want.
But there's nothing to stop you, if you take it out on terms, there's absolutely nothing to stop you coming in and paying, as long as you pay  before July, or by July  you get 
Yeah.
your sixteen percent off free.
But then also you've got, you, if you take it over say, twelve months you've got like a 
Yeah.
big safety net underneath you if you, if you find that you don't want to pay it in cash.
Yeah.
I mean, I know it's sort of the cheapest
Right.
and maybe, you know, that's not such a good thing, but  we were looking at the Phillips, erm 
Mhm.
but it's not, like that's got dual heat settings 
Mhm.
on int it?
That doesn't 
That's a auto sensor dryer that's why.
It automatically turns the temperature down of the drying.
You get a choice on that one.
That's why.
Yeah.
Mm.
There's more  to be done on that than there is on that, really, cos  .
Yeah.
Mm.
Probably.
Yeah, you're probably right.
 
It's just that my dad repairs mine.
I mean 
Oh right!
you know, and if 
Yeah.
if, as she says he's repaired it so many times!
Oh course!
Course he does!
But that's that one.
I want something that  that I can look at that for.
Erm  yeah can I
Yeah.
go with that one?
Do you want the insurance on it as well?
Erm  yeah, may as well.
Yeah alright.
If it's, if it's not expensive.
Hi!
It's about the  drier
Yeah.
with the .
Right.
For this lady.
Is it the small or the large   Crossley 
It's the large one.
The large one?
The  is it eleven pound load I think it is?
It's ten or eleven int it?
Er, er er er er 
It's one or the other.
Te er ten, yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
That's it, the four double one.
And, how did you want to pay?
Erm  well I'll pay cash but before July.
I will pay it in 
Well I can put it in as cash in July, but you just pay  before then, alright?
Yes.
I fancy some sleepers.
Yeah.
Just some ordinary ones, just to stick in and leave in all the time.
That's nice as well Tracy.
Mm.
I like that!
Int it nice?
That's not 
Is it nice.
expensive, but again, it can't be  real.
Look at that bracelet!
That three hundred and forty pound one.
Oh that's nice!
I quite like that, with that plain gold band.
Twenty seven 
That's nice!
pound .
Have they got any earrings?
I think I like that brooch!
Oh that's nice isn't it?
It is nice.
Mm.
Nothing much, but  oh look at the erm  things with the brooches!
Oh int it nice!
They're nice!
Got ages in.
Yeah.
That'd be nice to get  like, for Teresa, cos she never did get a
No.
pendant did she?
Nice coloured one.
Yeah.
Like to know though, in case it is anything to do with Nigel and then they can get it sorted out.
Yeah.
Yeah cos does that stop now, or does it  I mean, is that forever?
Oh I don't know.
Ha!
We'll have to  we'll have to write to them.
Just not bothered about cleaning it out.
It doesn't  it was so awkward!
Yeah!
May maybe if you had one of those erm  little rechargeable things that you didn't have to go and  round with leads and things, faffing about  you could
Yeah,jus 
just clean round it?
Yeah.
Be easier wouldn't it?
Bit of brilliant parking there!

Yeah.
You know?
He didn't have a scarf on this morning.
His big one?
Oh yeah!
Of course, yeah.
Woo!

I didn't ask Pat how Graham was going home?
Bet she's, she's quite relieved.
Yeah well  she was saying other day she's  he's never away from her  he's a damn nuisance!
Yeah.
Well it's bound to me, he must get fed up, but  eh, he don't really want  a job like, full time, he wants to be able to  he gets fed up of it being full time after a while.
Yeah.
It's no good for, let's face it like cos I'm gonna have to start er  
No.
It's a pity he couldn't stick to something like that cos I mean ex-policemen can get jobs like that no trouble can't they?
And I mean, somewhere like Asda is  a better place to work than  most.
Aren't you coming in today?
No.
Mm.
No, I suppose, in a way, he's lucky because he'd, he'd probably just  be able to get a job anywhere really just as security.
Yeah.
Well I've just seen  did you cotton on to that, it's not just me?
You know Julie  that had Sebastian
Aye 
cos , that baby
Yeah.
I've just seen her going that way, and I've just seen skinny Mick  that she used to go out with a she had baby to, coming this way.
I don't really know her that well.
I didn't think, I thought they hated the sight of each other.
I hope  Sarah wouldn't expect Julie to stay any later would she?
With her driving the  I never thought of that.
Gary , is he, is he the other brother?
Yeah.
She sleeps with Gary.
Yeah.
And how many  has Peter got?
Just the two, or three?
I don't know, Tracy.
I dunno.
He's just got the two ain't he?
James and Peter.
Has he?
Peter's alright.
Have you met him?
Yeah, he was in this morning.
He's works down at  in tra trailer place.
Oh Teres is Teresa's the wo the one that Teresa said he's al he's a bit of alright?
Or, is that not him?
No.
It must be 
Yes.
the other one.
No, it will be.
Teresa thinks he's alright, but I think he's .
He's got long hair!
And he's er  could be a right slob!
What's the other one called?
The other
Well as far as I know 
erm 
Peter and James, but James is the eleven year old 
There's another one that works at erm  down at a trailer place, is that Gary's son?
Must be Gary's son she thinks is okay.
One's got curly  longish curly hair, is quite broad built.
I don't know if it's Gary's son   Mark, he's about sixteen 
Does he live er in a flat on  Sandylands 
Peter.
I don't think  we, we might .
Yeah.
Quite possibly.
Well, I bet daddy's on his way home now.
Sarah's going quite , int she really,?
Yeah.
Yeah she has.
I wonder if it's  that every day ?
I would, I would think so.
Oh no!
She used to be head stable girl didn't she?
When his wife were there.
Oh!
Did she?
Yeah.
But I would imagine that's what she wants to train Teresa up for, so she can just run it  and she can sort of 
Well that's fair enough so she can .
Well yeah.
 

What?
There's John.
Did he ask you about steam cleaner?
No.
Not at all.
He was  coming in of a  about a fortnight ago, we were just pulling away  and he said to Teresa are you still doing?
And she said yeah.
He says, oh he said  when you see your sister will you ask her about steam cleaner?
And we said, oh she's in now!
Go and see her.
He didn't come in then?
No.
Oh!
Ah!
We're going to have to come back up here aren't you, to drop Alan off?
Yeah.
Not unless Alan drops his car off.
Alan could drop David off.

Don't we know what a cheeky baba-ba you are!
Sorry?
Look, there's that look.
Mm.
Right?
Go, go and see granddad!
Go see granddad!
This way.
Here he is.
It's not   Hiya.
What's the matter?
What are the ser terms?
Thirty days.
But they're not paying thirty days.
I've just explained that to him.
And he said he didn't know that, that he would get hold of Sen and ring me first thing, thing in the morning  er, to tell me why Sen hasn't paid.
He's got the invoice and everything.
I said well you've sent us twenty thou I said there is no V A T on it which it should be!
Deary me!
He says.
Has he got the invoi ?
I said yes.
And I said, we've been having, having the invoice outstanding since October at two and half thousand pound!
I said, you actually owe me six thousand, one hundred and odd!
And I said, you must realize I've a small company, and that's, in one respect that I've had to send those conditions because you're failing to meet the agreed thirty days payment!
Yeah.
And I said it's not on!
I said we couldn't survive like that.
And he said, well would you like to carry on with the contract?
I said we're too far committed now to, I says to back out.
I said, you know, we can't back out at this stage.
And I said, but I said if there isn't the payments of the invoice when they are sent  then  you know, we've go you've gotta look at it.
So that invoice wants
Doing.
Yeah.
it wants doing and sending, and put in i put twenty eight days on.
Yeah.
Had to be paid, it can't be paid by the twenty eighth it's er  you know  well if I could've got hold of David or er, Andrew , I was gonna give Andrew  a right bollocking for just pushing it in and he should've sent it to er, Michael , Michael  's just got it shoved in front of his nose a in Edinburgh.
He's just gone in to see if everything's alright at Edinburgh  and of course, that's why he's had to report for that.
Which was fair play to him, but bloody Andrew should have told him!
It's agreed, the system of stage payments, it's all written to him.
And you've just spoken to him have you?
I've just spoken to Michael .
Michael's great!
And you, you  so he understands after he's sent you this?
What?
What's going on.
Yeah.
Because yo di I said I had to send that agreement because you're failing to meet the standard agreement, you're not paying within the twenty eight days or the thirty days!
Mm.
I said I've got an invoice outstanding for October, and I said I can't afford to do that!
He said, I realize that.
Then he said, we wou want you to do that work he said, because you've got a good reputation.
It makes, you know, if we  we're not gonna go bust just to get twelve months bloody work out of him on a service contract!
You know, but i if we couldn't, if they we as they said, if they wanted that money back tomorrow we could only give them half that money back because of what we've got
Mm.
er, you know, but, we might as well just say to everybody, David, Geoff, Ian 
Yeah , well that's it.
ta-ta!
You know 
Yeah.
Yeah.
you're sacked!
The lot of you!
They've got a meeting with R F S next week.
Supposed to have.
But I'd, I'm gonna phone er, thing, because I think that's just a con.
Can you get hold of Andrew?
No!
I've been ringing him since that come through half an hour ago.
Tt!
See I hoped wi David to ring me before half past three before he sets off, and he hasn't done yet.
I've more need to get hold of Davi er to get Andrew and er  because he's at Mill Hill with sa with Steve and er Nigel.
We're not shouting at you.

That everything 
We just 
belonged to us tha 
well all that was said was, really, they had twenty eight days to pay.
Yeah.
And if they didn't pay  within them twenty eight days or
What I've gotta let them 
before the 
know is  really, and it's in the file, if they do pay up at the last we've just gotta get  
Yeah, but that's what they said that th the conditions of contracts that we sent, they don't agree with.
That's what they're saying.
Well really, what did we put on  that they can't agree with?
Th th different yeah they've already put invoices paid thirty days.
Thirty days.
That's what we put, twenty eight days.

And it was the week before that we went to
You'll have to put your dates on cos I, I couldn't 
Yeah it 
fathom out
it was the week before that we went to er
Well I don't know.
If it's not written down I don't know  when they've had or what they've had, you'll have to write it down and put a date on it.
And then, when I know  what I'm doing, I thought that they'd just had that.
No.
Well  leave that there.
Okay.
Where are you going?

Yes.
No, no problem.
No .
Here he's po processing it Monday.
And it'll be in the post today.
Po post .
No, no doubt about it.
And he said he's telling him point blank that he's, if there's any problems with invoices or anything, you have to deal with Andrew, he has to come back to me and deal with me direct!
So  he's realized how long you've been waiting?
Yeah.
And he said, it's not on, he said what he, he said er  getting the money he said we've got a lot of money in American bank and he said and getting that back it's just a pain in the arse!
It's a bloody nuisance!
And it's not often Michael swears.
And, he said it's a bloody nuisance!
He said, but he said it doesn't give us the excuse of not paying the invoices on time, and he said  erm  I have warned him for it this morning and he said he will process it, and he said the cheque will be in the post here on Monday.
Well he told you twenty four hours didn't he?
Forty eight hours.
Forty eight hours.
Ye well I told him that, yeah?

And he said, I do apologize, he said, for the mucking about, he said we want to work with our sub-contractors very, very, closely and have a good er relationship with them for ongoing work and stuff like that.
And he said i I agree with what you say, it's not the principle of, of making everybody wait like that.
No.
Well, that's fair enough.
D'ya think we've got it 
Well he di 
No.
he's he's got that and he's bound to get his earache 
What?

Yeah.
We need some steel for them hanging graphics.
Yes I know, but we're not er  we won't fiddle about with them until we get well on to the way because  if we do that now  we gotta take the welder up, you've only gotta cut them off again because they're in the way for the rest of the bloody coaches.
Yeah.
And that's what they've been cut off for.
Yeah, but the thing is i we can get the steel  er and make them up but we don't have to put them on till later.
Yep.

On Angela's side, not my side.
Yeah.
What numbers have I got?
Yeah.
Has she got them all?

Yeah.
Yeah she knows.
Well  only thing, the only thing you can do  if you got any P forty fives?
I have.
Yeah.
Well just write another one out and check the numbers on it  you know,and send that.
And send that.
Yeah.
That'll be easiest thing to do.
Messing about  with  
or do we have to 
No problem.
Yeah.
Cos if there's any handwriting on it, I'll forge it for you!
It's just ridiculo I mean, she wants to write that down  really I'm, I
I think it's because the her hands tied behind her back.
Yeah.
I know what's happening down there.
I tell you!
I've gotta go down and  see them anyway.
Yeah.
But , I mean, well you can do that anyway, just sort of make a co write a

I want my er  if you're going back for dinner, I want my camera and my film.
There's my
there's a black film somewhere kicking about.
In a new one, in a box.
And I want my camera to get a photograph of this when we get it outside.
Okay.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
It's on there.
It's on that side as well.
There.
I mean for him to ring you back and speak to you,i i he, he's been concerned about it as well.
Yeah.
He's probably walked in and seen that and thought, I'm not having this and  when he sat down and thought about it, like we've done
Yeah.
it's erm  I wonder if he's spok if he's got Andrew with him now?
No, he's int office.
Don't forget the film.
It's just that I don't want erm

about her being, getting in 
Yeah I know.
Enjoying them crisps!
What?
What do you think next step should be Neil?
Do you think solicitor or
No.
I think we ought to go and talk to them first and exp you know, put our side forward and if they don't want to play then, then you have a solicitor.
But  really, you already have.
Because you, Neil's already spoken to them about  how late th the thing was coming in the first place no and they've just ignored it!
Well there's no harm in having one last try is there?
Oi!
No!
What you doing?
Trouble is that 
Well if they owe us money and stuff like that, we might have to be going to court in the end with it  but the only trouble is, we're losing that much bloody time taking a day off and going down there!
Yeah.
This is it, you've hardly time.
Well that's what I say if you go down on  er Sunday, but they won't be there, we'll have to make a   organize a .
What?
Aye, they're a bloody nuisance!
Rebecca!
You just get sick of problems don't you?
It's just  seems
Well they tend to come in batches don't they?
You know 
Yeah.
we have a quiet period for a while and then all of a sudden they all crop up together.
I mean, at least, the one 
And you, you stand there at end of day and think well  is it our fault or what?
Yeah.
, we won't be dealing with anybody else for a while, I can tell you  .
Aye.
Well it makes you wonder 
Mind you, if you look at it like, like .
Yeah, but if, should we say  well we acc we'll accept half of it and and 
No!
It's  we, we shouldn't accept anything that  you know, we, we don't think's correct!
In fact, we know it's not correct.
Yeah but they might say, well alright then, and then  pay out and  as it is we're gonna have a lot of messing about haven't we?
Anyway, I'll  get in touch with Mike  and see if er
he's heard from insurance people for  cos I've already asked Mike
But ?
he said he'll ta no, to court if it goes to court  cos the insurance we've got out.
Oh right.
See if they'll pay it, he was gonna get back to me today.
And then we can go to Mrs , and let Mrs  write a letter.

Her mum's still in Manchester  .

It's nice!
They've changed the advert in the Steam World magazine and put end of that in.
Yeah.
We're talking about your  one outside.
We're talking about your one outside.
Oh!
That one?
Oh!
Oh!
I haven't seen it before.
Oh!
Haven't you?
Very nice!
It's brilliant!
Takes me that long to get them now.
Yeah.
Ah well so well so we, somebody said you'd emigrated like.
 
Yeah right.
Yeah.
I haven't got much territory now.
I'm all over the place!
Have you?
Mm.
Yeah.

Yeah.
You know , Blackburn and Burnley,and all that round there.
Accrington, Wetheral, Longridge.
Jeepers!
You get about 
All over the place!
a bit then?
Have you got pen and paper with you?
And Cumbria  for Dixons.
So like it's  a massive area now.
Yeah.
Have you got any pen and paper?
I'll get 
I want 
one.
I'll get one.
I want a quote.
Yeah.
Inch and a half 
 
box section.
Ten by eights?
Yeah.
Very good!
And I want some erm  the cheapest meshing, but I don't want big meshing.
I want a price because we're still waiting to hear from er  .
Oh!
Look at that!
Isn't it straight?
Look at that!
It's come out.
Oh!
I've got someone coming .
Yeah, it's funny, usually find with joiners  I don't know,i they're supposed to have a good eye for strai 
Yeah.
but they haven't!
I know.
It's amazing that!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I, well I,he didn't get here till about half past ten!
But
put a nail in  put something like that  that's about right  no, actually it's not .
Is it just held on with like, a couple of nails or 
Yeah.
Yeah?
Then it's  put on top.
Won't get that back from .
Right.
I'll see if I can 
 
Was it?
down there.
Mm.
That was
I'm going to put it out there  where they won't
Mm.
No you've done
Mm.
you've done very well!
Haven't you really?
Your first  your first year.
Yeah we did well but erm  we shouldn't have  like, you learn by your mistakes, but we  we kind of made profit and we shouldn't of done
Yeah.
erm, and now the tax man has hammered us so hard
Yeah.
that we're really struggling!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we're really having to struggle to sort of make ends meet.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
You  it's a diffi it's difficult 
It's wrong int it?
just striking up that balance int it?
Yeah.
Isn't it really?
And of course, now they  when we originally moved in here we asked about the rates and they said oh they co they wouldn't raise it because it was an unfinished project
Yeah.
and nobody had paid rates, and they wouldn't pay rates until they'd actually finished building on the land opposite.
Yeah.
Anyway, when the accountant came in to do the books  he said er, oh he said you've got to pay something.
So he said, I'll get onto them myself.
Anyway, apparently, he was told exactly the same thing as I was told
Yeah.
but of course, it had kind of stirred up a hornets' nest!
Next thing they were down with the measuring up and we'd just got a four thousand pound rate bill!
And, they've actually rated it at ten and a half thousand  erm  payable
Yeah.
three thousand eight, and of course, well Neil said there's V A T, I didn't think you had to pay V A T on rates?
I didn't, I didn't, you know, I don't 
You know?
Yeah.
Er  anyway  so tha that's sort of you know, made 
Mm.
a big difference.
That's suddenly four thousand a year we've to find.
Yeah.
I mean, if, it's crippling us is this place!
Yeah.
If it wasn't for this we could be  it would be quite good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But what can you do, there's nothing else about?
No it's  that's it.
And a lot of businesses up and down are er  are in a bad way, really.
Yeah.
Some very  sailing very close to the wind.
Yeah.
They're all finding it hard aren't they?
Well, there's less and less work  and the work that does seem to be about  is that competitively priced that 
Yeah.
you know, it's  negible whether you can make anything even if 
Yeah.
you get the work.
Yeah.
And then of course er  money is floating round very quickly.
No.
No.
I er, in fact, we, yeah, we just had a problem yesterday, we started work for the Royal Scotsman  and  erm  well we started work for them, like last year and we've been doing jobs
Yeah.
and we've had invoices outstanding since October.
Yeah.
So Neil said, well  these invoices weren't forthcoming, so I said to them, the thing, the thing is, if we start work and we buy a load of equipment  how are we gonna  sort of, how long's the cheque gonna, gonna be coming in, you know.
And you have to fund it.
So we asked for twenty thousand pound upfront.
Tt!
So, anyway, and they said, and before we wi we get this twenty thousand we also want the ou October's invoices clearing up as well.
So, that was  great.
Anyway, we've waited and waited  we've rung and we've rung!
Eventually a cheque came, instead of being like, for six thousands er, nearly seven thousand it came for four!
Yeah.
Erm, the twenty thousand eventually arrived, no V A T.
You know
Yes.
and all this sort of things.
So, of course, we were getting a little bit panicky  cos what's worrying me, and it still worries me  again  we've put all this time and effort in  they may pay us  alright, we've got this twenty, they may pay us a second payment, but are they gonna pay up on the third?
Well tha that's always the catch isn't it?
You know?
The last one.
Yeah.
So we actually wrote down  erm  th the equipment that we were buying was ours until paid for in full.
Yeah.
By them.
Yeah.
And we sent this letter up to them.
Well we've had their director on the phone, phone yesterday  and more or less demanded his twenty thousand back
Yeah.
and, if you don't want the work we'll take it elsewhere and all this.
Mm.
Erm
Puts you off doesn't it?
Well I mean, what on earth do you do?
Yeah.
Very difficult isn't it?
You just  well Ne both Neil and I have sort of felt well, to be quite honest it isn't worth it.
Yeah.
For what you make at the end of the day on, on somebody's  
No it's not worth it.
It 
Yeah.
well it, the running the business isn't I don't think  because by the time  the tax man's hammered you
Yeah.
you know, the V A T man wants his money, I mean the V A T man's been paid for all these invoices
Yeah.
and I still haven't got the money in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know.
Everything's against you!
Really V A T's, I think, and I think it should only be paid when it, when the invoices 
Exactly!
have been cleared, rather than always paying 
Exactly!
for that quarter 
Yeah.
even if you've not got paid.
Yeah.
Exactly!
Erm  mm, I don't know whether there's any way round it  but  that's sort of the set up that they gave us when we started and I guess I'll have to  sort of conform to that, but  it 
Yeah.
does seem unfair.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean now there's a couple of people quibbling about actually paying  at the  that we did.
Yeah.
There's still six hundred and odd pound outstanding.
Erm  I can't honestly see us ever getting that.
Yeah.
Erm  the funiculars  they're quibbling about the final payment.
Yeah.
About them being late and everything else.
Er, you know, it's just a, and I've paid for that and that and
There's extenuating circumstances like that 
Oh dear!
though isn't there?
As Neil said.
Well yeah!
Changes in specification
Yeah.
er, equipment coming in late, er 
Yeah.
you know, I mean
They don't seem to  want to know though.
I mean, Neil's tried to explain to them  that, they were late with drawings and everything else, it put us way behind in the beginning.
Yeah.
But all, you know, they've just not listened to him!
Yeah.
So 
Yeah.
I guess it'll 
It's er stal stalling  they're 
Yeah.
cos that's all it's doing innit?
Yeah.
Well solicitor said she, it sounded to her as if there's something more  to it.
Maybe they don't have the money.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they're stalling all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But erm  you see, they suggested going down for a meeting  he's up to his eyes in it!
Yeah.
And
Yeah.
he can't honestly spare time to go down there
It's costing you money isn't it?
Well yeah 
And chase your own  what's due to 
Yeah.
you.
That's, that's the .
And we know you're gonna have an argument.
So is it worth it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I, I personally feel that  give it to solicitor and let her deal with it, because
Yeah.
Yeah.
just not worth the hassle.
Alright 
Yeah.
that's gonna cost
Yeah.
but, but I mean you can only make it worse by  like you say, you're wasting your own time and money
Yeah.
you're not gonna get anywhere!
Yeah.
Yeah.
All gets 
I mean 
a bit acrimonious doesn't it?
And er 
Yeah.
Don't it?
er that sort of thing starts happening.
Oh it's painful!
Yeah.
It really is painful!
Yeah.
It's getting ever more difficult isn't it?
Doing 
Yeah.
business.
Ever more.
Yeah.
You just  I,th all this bumph about sort of trying to help small businesses and, things like that, they do nothing!
No.
No I know that.
They do nothing at all!
Yeah.
No it's er  as you say, all, all the cards are stacked i in 
Yeah.
such a way that it makes it ever more difficult.
Yeah.
The trouble is, see  you know, you've nobody you can go to, you, you've nobody that sort of will listen to
Yeah.
to all this and do something about it higher up.
Yeah.
I mean they just keep hammering and hammering and more and more are going out of business.
Yeah.
Alright,th the saying in the paper, they're talking about  stopping these big companies, keeping these little companies waiting  there could be something they can do about that, but how long is it going to be before they do something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a 
In the meantime  there's more and more going bust every week!
Well the trouble is, a lot of these MPs and  people on these committees  are actually  they've got seats on the boards of a lot of these big companies 
Yeah.
so it's not in their interests to push this through.
The longer they can stall  something 
Yeah.
like that
Yeah.
er, you know, the better it is, and particularly when you look at the  the fever that there is at the moment about  electioneering
Yeah.
is, is no big business isn't it?
No, that's true.
I mean maybe I should go and see local  erm  MP or 
Local M P.
whatever and, and, about the rates.
Yeah.
And see, you know, if they can do something about that, maybe it'd be right time.
Yeah.
Bu cos we're actually the only ones that have their rate bill  Barry's hasn't.
Yeah.
So, you know, they're 
Yeah.
just expecting us to pay!
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would.
And it's  Yeah.
That's what they're there for!
Well, yeah that's true!
Whether you've voted for them or not.
Yeah.
And , you know  in fact 
Yeah.
you pay your taxes and, and
Yeah, it's very true that.
you know, it can have .
I might do that.
Yeah.
Because if, if they've singled yourself out, it's, obviously, it's not right is it?
No it's not.
Well I said, well I'm not paying mine until somebody else gets theirs.
Yeah.
And have to pay theirs.
Yeah.
But erm  I suppose next thing'll be a court demand and, how d'ya fight that?
Yeah.
So
It's all a worry innit?
Yeah, int it?
Oh!
Headache stuff!
Never mind.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Never mind!
Oh well, keep your head down.
Yeah !
Yeah.
At least there isn't the same hassle as there was at  Calpers 
Yeah.
I mean  alright, yes, you sort of have worries, but most of the time, I mean, for all last year it's run pretty well.
Yeah.
It's only just recently that we sort of starting our de we've had bits of aggro.
Yeah.
Or at least, like 
So 
with this,a all the benefits are, you  get them personally don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er rather than 
Yeah.
doing the same amount of hours er and somebody else benefiting?
That's it!
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, it's, like his car for instance, I mean, that's always been a dream he never thought he'd ever be able to afford  a new car, erm 
Yeah.
you know?
Yeah.
And er, of course that's like a dream come true for Neil, so 
Yeah.
that's 
Yeah.
why we want to make a success and he  don't lose it all !
Well, you know, you've got to have er benefits of, of  taking a course of action like this haven't you?
Because 
Yeah.
otherwise  you know 
Yeah.
what's the point?
That's it.
What's the point?
I mean i 
That's it.
It's not that people want to get rich, it's just that you make a nice living and  enjoy 
Yeah.
what you like doing and that's it.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah, can well do without the sort of, the hassle and the aggro.
I mean, Calpers have made it  a lot worse for us.
Yeah.
They have.
They've done 
Yeah.
everything possible to make life difficult!
Yeah.
But er  hopefully they'll leave us alone soon.
But it doesn't help when we bring people like Geoff you see, cos Geoff comes from  Calpers 
Oh I don't, oh right.
Oh yeah.
He did.
I de I didn't recognize him.
Really angry  about it because they've had to bring somebody else in to do  Geoff's work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
So  I mean it was Geoff's choice.
Yeah.
Well, this is it, I mean, people  you can't make people do things, I mean, they've got to 
No.
want to do it haven't they?
So
Yeah.
This 
well 
is it.
we've done very little there.
They ju just don't seem to be doing any steel work at all.
No.
Well, everybody keeps telling us they're not doing anything.
They just don't know how they're surviving but they keep going on!
Yeah.
Yeah.
The man, he must have plenty of money to keep it, carrying it
Yeah.
as he is doing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But er
no doubt it'll all come out in  fullness of time 
Well yeah 
won't it?
It will won't it?
Yeah.
Things can't carry on indefinitely  in any business
No.
where nothing's being produced, can it?
No.
Oh well he's, he's told the lads that  it's only a matter of time.
I think that's  what more or less decided Geoff that, yeah, he would take it.
Yeah.
But erm
There you go.
Well if he's , I mean, that's what you want innit?
Well yeah.
Somebody who can turn yo you 
Yeah.
know, do a bit of everything.
Well it means, you see, apparently Geoff's done all the air braking at  Calpers it means that Neil can actually  some of the time, be here  rather 
Yeah.
than up there all the time with them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well , cos David really doesn't know anything  about the air braking or anything like that.
Right.
Mm.
So
Very good!
Anyway, I'll let you get on.
Yeah, it's nice to see you again.
And you.
Yes.
Gotta go and see the guy on the end now.
Oh yeah!
Haven't , haven't met him as yet.
He's  they've  opened an account with us and had a few bits and baps off us, so 
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, cos er, I think Neil was telling you that, they look as if they're gonna be buying plenty of gas off us if we, when we start taking the air products.
Yeah.
So
Yeah.
He's seems er, he seems okay.
Yeah.
But that's a big company I think.
Right.
Yeah.
Well 
But 
I think so, it looks 
Yeah.
it doesn't it?
I think we're only little one  here.
Yeah.
Right.
I mean , next door  he's a big  company based in London, so
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we're struggling !
I'll see you.
Alright Jim.
See you!
Bye!
Neil, I hate to say it, but I don't think  Teresa'll  will stick up there long.
They've just asked her to do  more hours, she's to stay till five at night.
Well  well she just wants to say well 
It's not fair is it?
you know  can  can she have some money?
Well, Tracy's just said that to her.
It's alright them asking you Teresa, but  you know, they, they should be prepared to pay you more.
Alright, I mean, we were just sort of thinking well  sort of four o'clock wasn't she, she was starting to come out to Che she came out with Cheeky with us last night, but of course, that's all gonna go again innit, if it's gonna be five o'clock?
What has Teresa said to her?
I don't like that.
Well she said , no she said to her, well what else can I say?
But, I'll ha I'll have to do it won't I?
I can see Teresa going back to Anna  's for season.
Yeah.
Well the horse job, that way is, is enough bloody heads.
Yeah.
Ah, you must admit though that's a bit it's a bit overboard innit?
I mean
Yeah.

Becky did didn't she?
Right.
For a long while.

They seem to get it and  then they settle down.

He said, no, he said th that you could either have one or the other.
It was a lot weren't it for 
They have a sweet or a starters, but they didn't have them both.
There's one at sixty odd which is, I think ri quite reasonable for three but  eighty odd for three of them!
It must have been a right 
of course it was 
posh 
more expensive  
Yeah , it must have been.
As long as it were worth it!
Never saw, you weren't meant to, and he says, no your mum said that we could either have a sweet or a starter, not both.
Yeah.
It sounds awfully mean don't it?
I, I said to your dad  I said it's  mm mm  you know  to actually say you can't have 
Well if they were, if they were going home they wouldn't be  having a starter and a steak and a sweet and all that lot would they?
No, but they are inconvenienced cos they're away from home but 
But  i i it's just
Well I don't know, I feel happier now your dad's had that bit of a do with that bloke, cos I feel that  we can go to him
Yeah.
and, and wi you know, hopefully get paid, there shouldn't be any problem.
Cos that erm  that Sen, that  accountant obviously isn't up to much.
He promised your dad, oh it'll all be sorted within twenty four, forty eight hours and that was how many, three
Yeah.
four days ago?
I don't think he knows everything ab about that or what?
Erm  he, he told him this morning on the phone, he's looked into it, he's the director  and he apologizes.
He rung to apologize this morning and said that it will be sorted  and you will have your cheque.
He said, I am sorry!
I didn't realize things were like this.
That's why  you sent them the conditions!
Well, that's what Andrew said.
If, if they'd have  if they'd have talked to Andrew first, Andrew would have told him why we'd sent it.
Andrew can't , he's just sort of passed that, that on.
Why has it gone to somebody who ?
Well apparently  it had gone to Andrew, and, Andrew had  cos Andrew isn't in the office all the time, and he'd left it in the office, and  I think they faxed it  by th Andrew was gonna talk to somebody about it, but of course, by the time he'd got there, it'd already been done and this had happened so  I'm gonna ring erm  Job Centre when I get home.
Yeah.
I, they'll say, I know what they're gonna say.
Like, you know  there's nothing they can do.
That's why, she'll be better to  stick it and then she was to Aunty Anne's.
At least when she finishes at, with Aunty Anne, it was seasonal.
she, she  Anne's gone   Aunty Anne's, she won't have to go to that job .
Yeah.
Oh God !
I've  
I'm starting to get a bit like that.
Yeah.
Although I seem, I slept alright last night, but I think when you've got things on your mind  no I didn't sleep alright, I was too warm, I tossed and turned most of night!
I was really warm.
Did you, you watched the  programme, the Queen did you?
Yeah!
Weren't it good!
Weren't it good?
I'm gonna 
Yeah.
get the video.
Just, it's half an hour  wanted to watch that on B B C two  half past eight to nine o'clock.
Oh I think it'd be nice to have a video, because like, when Rebecca gets older  erm  cos I personally, my own feelings are that  we might get Charles as King, but after Charles there won't be anything cos they'll do away with them.
D'ya think?
Yeah.
I think it will get to that.
There's more and 
In the end.
people against
Yeah.
Int she gorgeous!
Yeah.
I'll say!
It was nice to see, and it is always nice to see the, the other side of them.
The natural side.

She was good with the  kids weren't she?
Yes she was.
But she was, like when she, on the trailer they said about  and she said and the girls as well!

One or two people looked, I've seen them looking but  they've not actually questioned.
Yeah.
And it was, pretty horrible day yesterday!
That's right.
You were saying.
I said that, I said the back door's for you  but they're like  concrete.
Yeah, they were very solid doors.
I mean, they do actually, they're all metal.
Yeah.
The frames and everything is,th the only bit of wood is the wood on the inside, on the panel!
You see David, what he's saying to your dad this morning, let's get a meeting and go but  I just feel that, I just, what's the point of going for an argument.
Yeah.
And, and it will be, won't 
Yeah.
it?
I mean, because your dad isn't gonna agree to what they're saying.
No.
And well, I'm sure David won't anyway.
Because David knows how they were built as well as your dad 
Yeah.
does.
Well they've spent enough hours on them int they?
Yeah.
And, we made very little money on them.
Yeah.
And they're saying, if they do get away with knocking this money off
We won't have made anything.
We won't have made anything!
I mean, they got a damn good job cos  that, cos what we charged them, we charged them sixteen thousand each.
Well you think about how they were constructed and the number of man hours!
Yeah.
Nothing really is it?
No.
Yeah.
Are you coming, pop in?
Try and get over the bumps.   as well that, I go into work and don't see Teresa that often  you'd think she'd have the money ready on Friday morning wouldn't you?

There isn't.
I mean, okay, Peter give us it on Friday but  wouldn't you have thought, I mean thirty quid
Yeah.
she would have me got cash out or  dropped 
Yeah.

There's no excuse for that, it should be there.

Have you estimated?
Na no.
Went to look up her reading, they said  had to pay  I've used three times as much gas as I did  three times as much gas as I needed last time
Yeah.
but barely done three times as much.
Int it?
No.
Oh!
Mine's hundred and seventy two pound!
Ninety three mine!
Good grief!
See it's never been off that heating.
I've had it all day  get it going, apart, just from a   
Oh!
I think, I think that's .
He has done though.
I know.
Dada!
No I was really surprised, it was  that it's that.
I expected hundred and forty at least!
Ninety three, so  that's including  er  ten pound standing charge, you know.
Yeah.
So that's not so bad.
Said to Betty I said you ought  keep your bloody heating on Betty!
I said, look I said, your eighty three quid like that for the  wha and standing charge  I said, and there's yo you freezing to death with no heating on!
Yeah.
Just one, one  buying those damn cylinders every week to  ten days!
I says, get a heating allowance.
Six pound a week she gets.
Yeah, it's ridiculous!
It's nowt, but it's been cold.
But I mean she wo she'd spend that in her  in her cylinder gas
Yes!

I know it er  ten.
Mm?
Mm?

They've rung up this morning and apologized.
Eh?
They've rung up this morning and apologized.
Is that in Wales?
Oh no tha Rebecca!
That's Royal Scotsman I'm talking about.
Oh!
The one's, but he didn't  going to solicitors and 
Oh!
Right.
What are you shouting about?
What are you shouting about?
That's it.
You eat too much rubbish don't you?
Whoops!
Seven
Mm mm!
Are you ri are you ringing daddy?
Hello!
Hello daddy!
Say hello daddy.
Have you had some dinner?
Have you?
Had something to eat?
Have you?
Sorry?
Yeah.
Do you want me to do anything for you?
Oh dear!
Alright?
Yeah!
You are one little starved girl aren't you?
Yes!
And what does solicitor say?
Have you, er er  have you taken all your papers and your drawings and everything in?
No!
It's with  it's got to go through, we've got to see if we can get all the fees paid yet.
It's going through that  system, and once they've given us the go ahead then we can go to the solicitor in Lancaster.
I see.
And then,fee  I can't see how he can, well, do you wrong  when  er erm fancy, and they're trying charge for a  an hire of a crane?
Yeah.
Not your fault they had to hire a bloody crane !
Pathetic!
No it's  Tracy was telling David, and David said  David was saying same thing, David wants to  well like was saying this morning to Neil, we'll have to get a meeting up a go.
But, I was saying to Tracy, I can't see the point of going just to have a row, because  that's all it'll end up, I don't think they'll get anywhere  by having a meeting, I think they'll just row.
Because they, probably they won't budge.
You see, Neil's already put his side  about, we worked er  how can you hold us responsible for them being late in when
That's it!
for a kick off anyway, you held us up for three, five months  with drawings  being late!
Three months.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever it was.
They don't really understand that!
Before you let us have i the drawings.
And there was all that messing about there, and then we couldn't foresee the wagon having two punctures, blah, blah, blah and the rest of it!
That's right.
You didn't 
But 
do them.
they've just co totally ignored it you see, and still put it down, so they're obviously not prepared to budge.
No.
Well
So
put it into legal hands then.
And did you watch video last night?
No.
We watched the other fi he he wasn't in till eight o'clock.
Oh!
Richard.
What you got?
And 
I'm wondering if I should ring them actually, from unit, and ask them if  tell them what's happening  and  will she be able to go on Income Support if she does give it up?
Yeah.
Well, you know.
Will I?
Shall I?
Wait while your dad's out of room.
I don't think you can do anything about me not getting an erm  they should just pay me more shouldn't they, if they ask to ?
Well Jake was saying that  he actually  why you're owed the forty five quid is  he put us down on the wrong one with your  .
Yeah.
I do less than her, but she usually  a tenner.
Yeah, you see, this is it isn't it?
She's teaching you.
It's whether you feel 
Well I'll say to her rather than you teaching me, I'd rather you paid me!
You won't will you?
See, you're hopeless!
Yeah but it's like  it gets me because  like Jane  Jane gets asked  they only ask her every Saturday.
Jane doesn't have to pay.
No.
Jane's only paid , twenty five pound for her
But she's helping
Yeah.
int she?
Cos she helps out.
Erm 
Yeah.
That's right.
but point is Teresa, would you, if you went back on Income Support you've got that job club thing again don't you?
So I  can you not just stick it out till I ring Brian?
Yeah?
And then go, cos it's not far off Easter is it Tracy?
No.
April?
April.
So you've only got like February and March  and April.
Yeah?
Yes.
Yeah well do that  and put up with it till then, and then just see how it goes.
I'm afraid that she's not gonna 
Unless I er , I do some
she int gonna get anybody to, to do for them sa number of hours and 
No way!
People would, you know, I mean it  I mean  that other lass was only there six weeks, Teresa's only been there  a few weeks.
She's got to start paying people more money.
Is that in, that's got ?
And that will be
No, it's not.
You can't just use people like this though.
It's not on!
I know she's teaching you but  how, you're certainly earning your money it's hard graft!
Honest!
It is.
Right.
Get Tupples.
I don't want her to shit on your head.
Whoops!
All these peas rolling about.
Whoops!
And Rebecca's had her trifle.

It's simple as that innit?
Yeah, it won't be first she's had  you know, er  eight o'clock till  four o'clock  and then if you want to, work, work any more hours  erm
They're supposed to pay you more money.

She's go 
mind doing that, but 
she's gonna need her at weekends as well, in the summer, because she'll be away eventing.
The only thing you can say, you know, do you mind if I ask you,sh it's bugging me  by working these long hours will I be getting any more money?
Cos she can't really do anything if she says no.
You know, I mean, she says oh you've gotta finish, er at least she comes out and get your .
Yeah.
Teresa says, well saying that funny mood 
Just ask her .
she's in again.
Sarah, can I have a word?
Just say, you know  it's just bothering me a bit  about these long hours, do I get any 
That's right.
more money for it?
That's all you need to say, and if she says no, then you know how to .
this morning.
Eh?
She had to come with me and fell asleep this morning.
Did she?
Where did you go?
Just out to  Whitewall 
Stop it!

He was just coming out.
Go in the other day.
Rebecca!
Find the scissors.
Yeah.
Ah!
And el you're a bit cheesed off are you Teresa?
Yeah.
Well  erm last  it annoys me though because  cos she said erm  Ricoh, when Ricoh worked in there they give her twenty five pound and looked after her horse as well, so
Well, we're not taking Cheeky down there.
And you, you gave her a hundred 
No, I know that!
quid.
No I'm not.
No but she was obviously better off weren't she?
But better, she  yeah, cos 
Yeah.
she was on better money there.
You know.
Yeah I think it's bad.
I don't like my lessons, I'd rather have the  money, if that's what she's  saying 
Well 
like.
just say to her
Mm.
just nicely, just say  you know, it's just bugging me like, these extra hours because I've got my own 
Yeah.
horse to look after  and I'm, you know  is there any more money ?
I really don't mind 
Go down 
the extra hours
child!
in the summer.
Come 
And 
here!
oh she says erm  it's just getting a bit too much now because  I'm gonna start  
Go to daddy.
and teaching people  and I 
To daddy.
want you to work later.
Well, just say to her, you know, working later, is there any more money in it?
Mm.
It's not 
That's the only thing you need to say.
It's e 
It's not that she could be  offenced at that  about that 
It's extra responsibility and everything!
If she's gonna go off and just leave you it's, it's all extra responsibility int it?
Well naturally  
I mean, yeah.
I Jake's   as Jake was saying  
About to say ask Jake for 
you want more money and all if you're doing extra hours.
Yes, he says er
I'd get more money alright.
Mm.
He says that, that  
Well I reckoned up this morning  we reckoned it'll perhaps be at fifty two, but we were wrong weren't we?
It's actually forty  is it forty nine and a half hours it'll be?
I was only working forty hours at  Post House!
On the   but she said erm  that she were going away  and I could work, cos the lessons finish on a  sa start up there on a Thursday, she said, if I work Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  and I could have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday  Thursday off.
Oh!
Mhm.
Well that's fair enough.
Ah!
But I'd rather have the Sunday off, cos of Cheeky.
Yeah.
if she wants me to work.
Yeah.
Yo she likes to give your dad hand, that's what she's thinking, and on Sunday it's hard.
Unless they're gonna get mucked out on Sunday, have to buy a couple of bags of sawdust.
I'll ask him though.
How many Nesquick things do we need?
About a dozen.
Cos that's the only one in here.
That'll go back in.
Yeah.
There's some missing.
Int it cute?
Cumbria Power Tools, is it Brett?
I don't know  what  I don't know where little, little one's come out 
Okay.
of.
Eh?
So I'm not sure where the smaller one's come out of.
Well we don't want to buy any more unless we know where they come out of.
Well d'ya
Also, we ordered the armature, it came through a couple of days ago, we put it, but it's going the opposite direction.
It actually er one lo a fa going into in detail, there's one load of armature's the wrong way.
Turn it over.
 
Eh?
Turn it over.
We co we've tried to pull , but if you pull all the , swap the  the leads round  or shove the brush leads round which is the obvious thing to do in that case, you know, er  in that  no they're successfully sparking excessively.
So, we're gonna have to obviously send the armature back for  at er
And they can also switch one.
No, I would  recognize the   you know 
 
.
There's a colour code on them.
What three more?
No, it won't be that long.
Well see, if you're desperate for a machine I'll lend you one
Something to do doodles on.
Give it 
Oh right!
back to Annette.
I like doodling!
Also  did you leave any special ?

No they don't.
No they don't.
You have got a rotten abscess have you Brett!
Yes.
It's unbelievable I tell you!
This is quite painful really 
Yeah.

If you're not careful  you'll have another one other side!
Leave him alone!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I went to bed last night with Night Nurse

Hooray!
I thought I was giving you more than that, ee, first of all I went to fifteen percent, you said 
Two, three, three.
yo seventeen off, I said, and the order's mine, then I went in at twenty percent.
We you know, I could have got away with giving you seventeen and half percent!
You'd have got some stick!
I know.
Because we'd have got from  Spiro's 
Hey!
Nothing  at  Spiro 
Fifty two 
Tell you what, we are  you don't do bad for  tools that we buy off them.
Yeah, well  did I leave you one of them catalogues with all the good tools ?

Pending.
Have a look at them .
Thing is, a lot, lot of them 
Two hundred and ninety two less twenty percent.

Thir thirty three eighty six.
Brains of Britain is there before you!
Seven 
 
Plus V A T.
Yeah.
That's it.
V A T's not added.
She'll probably back up and it's same figure again.
Say it at same price again, yeah.
Mind you, it's 
Well that's what I said about bloody V A T for!
Stupid V A T!
Innit daft?
Yeah.
How about these er  sanders?
Ah!
We're gonna stick hold of them for a minute or two because we haven't 
Right.
got that job to do yet.
That's fair enough then.
I'll  fill that in as well, Northern Hydraulics because I'm paying er   hydraulics prices for er  seals when we can get them half the price off them.
Yeah.
The erm  belts for these  sanders
Yeah.
it's far cheaper to get a  a san sanding belt and cut it down, you'll probably get about five belts out of one sanding belt.
Mhm.
Oh right!
Don't go 
Can you cut the  or anything?
You can rip them.
Ah right!
They're like a fibre, they're er er 
And how do you glue them together?
You don't.
The end  aren't they?
On your  your multi-purpose sander  if you go for black   pack of three, I think they're about three ninety odd, that's what they were se selling them to the er   
Is it three Market Street?
Er er 
That's er ,about one fifty for one  as long you get the right size and then just, just tear to whatever thing.
You're supposed get them 
 
with a ruler and jus just pull them.
Cos they're, they're like a cloth  cloth belt.
That's a good idea!
I'll, we'll do that then when we're ready.
We're just trying to save you money you see!
Yeah.
Yeah !
We need erm er eventually get the er    the roller.
Have you?
You got invoiced for it as well.
I apologize for that.
Are they , that's your mum, not the bikes!
Oh hell!
It's
Right, I'll go and do some more.
We, have we got an in 
 
have we got an 
See you !
invoice?
But he 
What for?
but he's just said we got invoiced for it.
Have we got a credit to come?
Oh yeah!
We'll credit it you.
Have we?
What for?
Yeah.
You know, this er seven pound 
We got 
off.
No it's at the side of it.
Well we'll take it out of my salary.
Yeah.
No.
So, are you gonna 
If there's any tools wise er  erm
No!
No!
we'll use your side if you don't mind er 
 
whether it's electrical or not.
Er 
Right , fair enough then.
Er
But one thing I must stipulate 
Nuts and , nuts and bolts and stuff like we'll deal with the other side.
But
Yeah.
we'll deal with you for tool side then we'll be lot happier.
We have a  a weird system how it works, and I've got my hands tied behind my back erm  if you're on  with fasteners you can't use Power Tools.
No.
Until I break free, and go into my unit.
Yeah.
Alright.
So  but there again if I get the enquiries fas I mean, that obviously is  the enquiry came through to me so obviously I quoted on it  but 
Yeah.
anything like nuts and bolts, fixings, fasteners, that type of thing go, has to go through the  
They only stop them cos I hang on to choice int draw.
Well it's  
 
The thing is, because of the profit margin, I mean 
If there's a Cumbrian Fasteners one in there give it, take it back!
Because of the profit we're 
 
we're making on the hand tools, things like that er, works with our account  money, cos you get a thirty day account.
So, if you go on thirty days unfortunately we we'll enforce that.
Yeah.
Nothing personal  
Tha that's erm yeah this is 
Well they haven't done it, that with us, we've been on the thirty days and just no  
Well our fasteners in they might allow you to go to forty five days  
Well what she normally does 
Could of given you  
I've said to her, it's 
Mm.
it's, it's normally me who forgets to put 
Oh yeah!
the bloody cheque in post!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And if she gets er over that date could she give us a ring.
That's right.
And she does.
It's fascinating her.
Just gives us a ring and say, have you got your cheque?
And I said, yeah, and I drop it into her now.
It's normally me that forgets to er 
What, what I try to do I just hang on to them till somebody shouts.
Well tha that's what a lot of people do.
You've got to.
Because erm 
You've got to wait for your money haven't you?
well we're finding that out.
When we first started
I used to pay them straight away but the big companies aren't paying us!
No.
We found the same.
And er  it's just chronic!
So, hopefully they're gonna stop that.
Well I shall have a good look at that  when I 
Yeah!
get er
have a look.
some er
Thank you very much for the order.
I shall take my little black bag and be gone.
I hope your mouth's better soon.
So do I!
Looks really painful!
Well we can get rid of your mouth for you!
Lovely!
Mm.
Just give you one quick smack and that'll be through to the other side!
He's horrible!
Well that's damn nice innit?
It's not very nice though!
Int he nice to you Brett?
He's not a very nice man!
How long have you known him Brett?
Er, I'll go and get 
Too long!
another bottle of er antise am Ambesol  or imbecile whatever they call it!
 
and he's never had a better job than what he had at Widnes, I'll tell you!
Yeah, a mere pittance of pay!
Twenty two pound 
 
for a forty seven hour week!
Oh!
You go that one there.
Forty five quid, she's, she's gonna be only doing sixty, seventy hours a week!
Forty five quid.
Where's that, why's it  ?
No!
She's at 
No!
the horses at erm
Edminton.
Edminton's place.
Oh yeah.
And they're paying her forty five a week, she does about forty nine hours now and they've 
Eh!
just told her  she's to er, she's got to stop on another hour at night, till five o'clock instead of four.
And in summer it'll be half past seven or seven o'clock when she finishes!
Shee!
I just said to her , you know, just  tell them
Not worth getting out of bed!
you know, just ask them if there's any more money in it if she works the long hours.
The trouble is 
Well if I go on the premises,work with me and he's   trained like you had one for Steven .
Well we've got one here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, I've just  as a basic figure, I mean, they give up to a certain figure o before their hours you put a bit of tax and after that, but er  we've allocated him to work, in the afternoons when I'm out, they allocate to her, the warehouse , because I can't afford any, er, as I say, they repairs a machine, it goes out faulty, and the onus is on me and the company
Yeah.
and he ha he hasn't been trained up fully yet so he, you know  but plus, the course he's on at er college isn't doing him any good.
That's what happened to our drill you see, you've had apprentice on it!
You're right.
 
 
I've, I failed miserably so I thought, I've had to put the apprentice on it you see!
No, it er
Things can only get worse then.
Probably.
I gi him general things on their own, I mean, it's, it's really quiet.
I mean I  as a company Cumbria Power Tools will always, you know, it will survive because there's only me and this
Oh yeah!
this  there.
But er  it, it didn't take a lot to keep me busy.
But fasteners, I mean, you know I mean, things are 
You're not having this.
are struggling, we've had a couple of  
But you must have your regular customer?
Cos we're er
Oh we do!
we're your regulars.
Then you've 
They bought 
gotta do
they 
since you left Widnes.
This is it!
On the fasteners side, they know they're not the cheapest 
Coming off.
a lot of people Cumbria Fasteners  
isn't there?
Right?
They know what they can source elsewhere but 
Yeah, but I mean they don't 
if, if
No I haven't.
people wanna get them there
The only trouble that a lot of people, I think Cumbria Fasteners, in one respect 
Shall I do it now?
Yeah.
would get, if they got their act together 
And see what's happening.
they would have a lot more customers whatever the price.
Cos you want to get cracking don't you?
Yeah.
The they lose a lot of customers  er  to, to other people that  sometimes charge them more.
And we get pissed off with Cumbria 
Yeah.
when you 
Yeah.
go and se stand in there for half an hour!
And there's one man  
I know!
One.
who hasn't got a clue of the order!
Well, if you want anything
phone up the order before and, and as soon as that enquiry's taken 
 
it's picked from the shelf 
Oh no!
Hang on!
and it's put on the shelf with your order form.
Yeah, go on then.
Well we've, we've done that before haven't we?
We've rung 
The last time  
and said look 
 
 
 
and we still have to wait half an hour!
Well, don't say that I've,seen you 
 
just ask, ask for Brett, just say you want an enquiry about parts or .
No?
That's what it says.
Even though you might think it's  
Okay.
It's three two.
they, they don't know  just walk around in the warehouse, they are 
Yeah.
doing things, you know, at er  they're not standing about there.
Yeah well you you know I've been in there on a Saturday morning when there's been six of us there and one bloke serving, you know, I mean
