Medium brushes off church's protests
By Ray Kelly A SHOWDOWN between a stage psychic and a clergyman passed off peacefully…with a battle of words.
The audience at medium James Byrne's Prescot Civic Hall show politely ignored religious demonstrators outside.
Pentecostal minister the Rev Colin Hill and a dozen members of his nearby Kemble Street Elim Church congregation asked more than 100 people going to the show to turn back.
Most took their leaflets, warning of the dangers of the occult, but there were no confrontations in front of a handful of police officers watching from a riot van last night.
The objectors sang hymns and said prayers ‘to protect the people inside the hall from demonic possession,’ while 30 friends held a service in the church.
Mr Byrne said: ‘I respect these people's right to their beliefs, but they should not shove them down people's throats.
‘The show must always go on.’
But Mr Hill, who performs exorcist rituals, said: ‘We had to make a stand.’
Mr Byrne…respects others' beliefs
