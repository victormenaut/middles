And the special.

You don't know if you're 
I forgot about that.
wait 'till  you're gonna have to do your own thing there when 
Yeah.

Yeah.
I don't think they'll be any use then.
What did you want?
What did you just put addresses or something?
Yeah, I put  well I put the name as well 
How do you spell socializing?
I put the name of the person I was with  S o c  i a l l y  I think  No!

Yeah, yeah.
so it's obvious what you did, and then I put the name
What of the there person?
Teacher 
Yeah of the teacher that you were with.
What this side?

come over there, just a sec.
And employment you put  erm  where you were and what you did.
Isn't it  Wesley Road?
No.
Oh no   Road.
Yeah  you you just

Go on let us 
At  
in on it  oh  where did you?
She's not that 
at the schools?
Yeah you do each  one that you took in the list and then do  don't do the result if it's c or above otherwise you don't fit it, apparently  that's what she said  she sa do the result if it's good  but don't bother if it's bad, or something.
The whole point is G C S E's you see, get them even if you don't get c 
I know 
or above.
and apparently they're changing them now anyway.
I know  so it's stupid  
They're changing it to more exams  I mean, it changes to G C S E in the first place to get rid of  having 
Exams.
so many exams and have more course work and now they're complaining about  cos it's a hundred per cent course work in English, they're complaining about that and they want to make it and a maximum thirty per cent course work within two years, or something  something really stupid like that!
They should change this course.
No, but I reckon I was in the best year, sort of, for G C S E's this year  and the year that's just gone, were the best years  cos they  they do all the .
Can you do  
English language and literature  G C E's or C S E's, not G C S E's.
What are you talking about?
That's with the olden days!
They must be old!
In the old, Liz, so did you do C S E's or G C S E's?
That's what I thought   Speckled white bits!
I did G C S E's in the first year.

What are you applying for?
What age group are you applying to work with?
I'm gay!
That's what  I bet!
What are you looking for cos it's gotta be linked to what you're applying for  if you're applying 
If you're applying to work with three to five aged children then you write references
It's that erm  holiday thing  holiday camp thing.
Then do they do nurseries  do they do nurseries?
What age children are they then, yeah nursery or  primary school cos you can get hold of different 
Yeah so you're infant school and you're primary school  yeah 
From now on I'm gonna do my family.

Why?
Little kids 
How old were they in the family?
Yeah but you're not working 
looked after 
in a family, you're not applying for a job in a family, you're applying work in a children in a group.
With with larger groups of children 
innit no but I can look after a baby.
no but it's gotta be  possibly, yeah but it's still like 
it's gotta be mixed 
with older children isn't it?
And you're supposed to try and link it  with bigger groups of children, so if you say you say you've got primary skills 
Have you  
Yeah!
Alright then.
I don't know how you got that on the list.
I'm just  ow!
Oh dear!
Then you've got to think of your references  problem is the job that I'm applying for is working in the school  and my reference for primary school is  Redland School  cos that's where I was  I thought ooh yes that would be laugh if I apply for  Redland School  yeah great  so it's gonna come under wor work experience and reference  I don't know  you can put 
No 
M C as a reference 
Oh!
I don't know.
Cuddling course tutor !
Do you mind if I put you as my referee.
I don't think you have to do referee on there, you just have to have references, I think?
I don't think she's that bothered.
She doesn't bother asking for them anyway  I don't know the name of er 
What?
I don't know .
I didn't know that, I thought I'd put down what, some of the people  one of the babysit for as one of my references  because I babysit her kids at primary school age 
 
and she's got a 
 
really funny surname  it's like  or something cos it's Dutch or something
Yeah.
or Finnish!
I got some of that  .
You just write down any name it doesn't matter !
What?
It won't change.
What bit do you wanna delete?
Just trying to delete that   lost your place  Urgh!
No it kee keep going with the arrows and get it just behind  the letter you wanna delete, keep going, keep going  go  keep going, keep going and again  now delete, backspace
backspace  that one
Oh.
that's the one that you have to press  keep going  now press  that's it.
Right, now that anyway should be see ending
Oh well.
up there I want it.
Yeah, then do the same  that's it!
Oh  well I'm glad I can help!
Hee hee hee!
God is that how you spell ?
Yeah.
Where does it get it's name from anyway?

How do you get your space up again?
Hang on, what's that?

And then backspace, I think, I'm no I'm not positive on that so don't take my word for it, you'll probably mess the whole thing up!
Mm.
You mean get that up?
Yeah yeah.
I think you press  backspace  so that'll just take it to the end and then if you press again  no it's just gonna delete 
now it'll delete all that.
I can't remember what it was now  but I know there's a way to move it up again, I think  oh unless you put it there and press backspace  just above 
Where, there?
the a  then space above the a, cos at least then if  it doesn't work it's not gonna delete anything  go down again, that's it now backspace  stupid thing!
Oh I don't know I'm afraid  Ooh!bit of a stupid thing anyway!

What are we meant to write on these picture then?
Dunno.
Another day  what you  there?
Yeah you write the, sort of, how long it took to do it and if it was  if there was more one and what they said about it an  
and mess it up.
There's seventy pictures there.
It's more than I've got.
How many have you got there?
About that.
About fifty forty, fifty.
I've got that.
I've got that.
So I got about ten   twenty five
Mm.
one hundred and twenty five.
And you got a few bits that your  
I think I've got about thirty.
and then
pictures though 
What pictures?
aren't they?
I've hardly got any in  cos when I left  my nursery  I got them all to do me one  and when I left my school I got a load of them to do me one  I didn't  get many at  the day nursery, but I got a handful.
 
mine actually!
I got quite good ones actually  cos I got two children next to each other and a few years later I got them to do it again  but I don't know if I can find them all.
There actual
Did you buy two samosas, then?
Mm.
Are they for you  yeah?
 

I meant for you  only on one  one enough .
I didn't even know what they were!
Ooh!
Just have a little tiny bit.
my craving.
Is you craving satisfied?
Yes it is.
Good.
Feel fine now.
Don't want you craving all over Mr !
Thank you very much!
Em !
Em.
I think I'm gonna try and persuade my Mum to let me bring  my camera in  for the last day of term, I'm gonna get a bottle of  from the  shop  that's on.
Ooh ooh ooh  
If we go now 
Ha?
Cos I did ea , by Monday I felt sick and I eat quite a lot at the weekend which was  good, but  Tuesday I start at placement and we, although like we talk, we don't have, like a, conversation we  as well and there wasn't really anything to record, saying  yesterday   to record  and
Did you record here yesterday?
and she's, what's that?
Did you record here, yesterday?
No  something so no, sort of, start at lunchtime anyway so I couldn't record any lunchtime.
No, in the morning we weren't doing a lot anyway, were we?
No so there wasn't anything that I could record then  and the woman's coming tonight, to pick them up   
And you've only done, how many?
Seven.
How many are you supposed to do?
I've only done seven  Well there's twenty tapes and I've gotta do as many as I can, I haven't done half of them yet, but  if I could have them over the weekend I'd be able to do loads more cos I'm  working on Saturday, I'm going out Saturday, I think
I'm going out Sunday night  and I can ta take it then  and I'll be able to get another, like four or five tapes done.
everyone thinks she's sat there  what's she done to her head?
It just depends where we're going cos I don't know what we're doing yet  So I'd and the woman's coming round tonight  so I'll just, sort of, say to her if I can keep it over the weekend I can do a lot more  so otherwise I'll feel a bit bad 
How much are you getting paid for it?
Twenty five pound voucher or something  Dunno what the vouchers are for  but that would be in my hand anyway
Oh.
whatever I suppose.
You ought to get, a voucher for what?
Don't know  I would think that it's, she told me twenty five pounds so I thought it was gonna be like cash or something  and then I read the thing that says twenty five pound voucher but it didn't say what for, it just says voucher  knowing my luck it'll be book tokens!
 
Lovely!
Well I can still get a couple of Christmas presents with that anyway so it doesn't matter.
Get Boots vouchers  cos 
Mm.
you can use them in Children's World can't you?
Can you?
Yes  it's where I used mine.
But I'd still be able to use them anyway, cos all them Boot Boots smellies and stuff  so
Yeah you can get  records and that there as well 
Mm.
can't you?
I got
from Boots.
Emma did I tell you Joe, she's working at the Body Shop.
I  Children's World and I got I got books.
Ah  you know the Joe that was staying with us?
She was working at the Body Shop part-time, she's back there three days working now or something.
She started on Monday  and 
Ha!
apparently she doesn't know why they sacked her  she said, they sacked  apparently something to do with she'd been asking too many questions or something  and but she 
That is  
cos  to be really eager because  she said erm  that she'd asked the bloke about staying on permanently and everything  and he said that it seemed the people who they were most impress impressed with after Christmas that can stay on permanently  so we said on the end, you've gotta be really eager and everything  so she apparently was asking loads of questions
Yeah, Oh you can't sack her for that!
because she asked loads of questions!
That's what I thought  I think that's out of order 
That doesn't matter!
and that's .
shop is supposed to make  at home 
Yeah 
their employees.
Yeah  and that'll mean 
that's an unfair reason to give her!
Not quite sure  but I'm not 
Never going  again.
quite sure why  and I don't know  how long she's working there.
Maybe there's more to it than that, you never know.
Well she's supposed to be working there 'till Christmas anyway  but
You'd better learn to drive then.
 
Quick five minute walking, you know
I don't know, you see, I just heard that she'd been sacked and
As long as you've got knickers on, it's alright.
It's bloody  
Can't  
Hang on 
sing  
No he's not gonna  he's not getting it 
We've got enough without him in it.
Ah we stick together or something.
I haven't heard that.
It is te well it's a typical  , you know.
You know most boys have their own  they use the  it seems scruffy, but if , do you know what I mean?
   
 
   
I I think tasty!
Nice car!
Who's pretty  tasty ?
This bloke they are trying to set me up with.
Richard !
No, no not Cliff Richard,.
So you're trying to set her up then?
George Michael went out with  it was really nice.
Yeah.
Really good.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Elton John!
Elton John!
Oh it's noseless!
He said it ooh where's my nose !
 
I reckon someone's 
Look my 
Dent.
scratch on his nose.
This has gone all wonkey, someone's moved it!
 

Alison  his nose as it was around there, they've gone a bit bumpy.
Yeah.
Mm.
A bit, Oh God!
Yeah but it doesn't matter.
It looks really nice with handles.
Yeah I thought I'd got all those bits out, but thank you.
Ha ha ha ha!
Don't tell everybody I said to that  Yes they'll be probably be smashing  even when 
bound to get a break off, they're bound to.
What?
The ears, these little ear bits.
No they won't.
Very  today   so contagious  it's horrible!
What is it 
Well what have you got?
conjuctivitus.
Ooh!
Ah !
It's going round our nursery.
I woke up yesterday morning, I couldn't open my eyes!
At our day nursery.
Urgh!
So have you got like drops or something?
 
Yeah, drops and this  revolting cream  that smells foul!
Oh yeah  under.
Did 
Yes.
Yeah.
You look really lovely, as you've got bloodshot eyes and this yellow  cream.
.
Oh you've  
Nice!
Liner!
And it's a lot, yesterday I was in a real state  notice my eyes were just totally, gummed up, yuk!
Actually they're probably .
Wake up in the morning .
That's right, right let's  the brushes now, class.
Well, are we painting them today?
Yeah.
Ooh!
No, we're  !
 
Yeah 
and stare at the .
Now what you do 
Why not?
I can't 
Alright?
Yeah.
You're going to paint them 
 
Can you keep still for a minute, Kim?
I tipped something on them.
You're gonna paint them exactly as you would  if you were just doing it on paper  alright?
God!
It's quite a strange thing to paint on because it's a very absorbent surface  and what happens if you wa , those of you who want subtle colours, well that's fine  cos you get very subtle colours  if you want deep colours like black  dark brown  or a bright colour like bright red berries on the holly  then we have to put varnish on  alright?
And it brings the colours up to really, really vibrant  dense colours  alright?
But I suspect a lot of you would want to leave them with a matt finish, it's entirely up to you  Anyway  when you paint, like I say, it's just it's because it's porous  it sucks the colour off the brush and er  it immediately dries, so you can see, straight away, the colour it's gonna be  when you then put the varnish on you use a sort of matt varnish and  so it brings the colour up but it won't be shiny  or a shine, which you're gonna choose  like you might wanna matt varnish with this and shiny for the shell  which ca it really brings the colour up, we won't get round to varnishing today  erm  and the other thing you can do, if you want  erm  a sort of a mottled effect  you do pink in a base colour  say Mikila wanted all  greeny, bluey colours on that 
Yeah I do.
oh well, there you go  paint it all  a fairly pale green  and then rubbing on dried powder paint  like, almost like using pastels 
Yeah I just want loads of different shades of green and blues   
Like using pastels, you just  rub it on with your finger and get really  subtle blend of  there so, you can have it plain black and white or  brilliant red  or  you know, very subtle, so you can get all sorts of paint effects on them  okay?
What I suggest you do is, sort of, give them all a base coat, you know, like  do all this mid-brown, but darker brown on the shell  okay?
Black and white.
Yeah, now
Do we have to paint underneath the side?
Well I think it's best to, yeah  yeah, I mean o the best thing to do is actually lift it up and use a little bit of the underneath to try out the colours  what colour's that going to be?
I don't know  I haven't decided.
What colour's yours going to be,?
Black  pale brown underneath  and brown edges  
I think grey might be quite nice, for the walls, but then  rubbing other colours all over it, sort of you know, like mauvey and   colours and blues.
I'll do these two all over grey.
Really burn my arm.
Yes 
Try not to  do it as you go, I mean, try to have a very definite idea in your mind what you want to do cos otherwise, you know, you start off, you've painted half of it grey and think oh don't like it like this bit!
So try and decide, I mean, obviously a lot 
Brown.
of them they're, you know
Brown .
you don't, you don't have to do it brown though, you know, I mean whatever colour you want.
I want it bright.
I'm 
If you wanna have a purple hedgehog, it's entirely up to you!
No leave that one.
Okay?
Okay?
Will these all stick back on?
They all will stick back on, it's best to paint them first and then stick them on.
Right I've gotta go and find some more of those,
This isn't his tail he keeps standing on!
I worked that out!
It must be there
Yeah it's there somewhere, it's just a bit too big to be  
Unless Emma's got it as well.
Unless Emma's got it there.
Yeah fine.
Yeah.
I know she could have.
Yeah.
What's yours gonna be, Eva?
What colour?
Just that colour on there, on the other one.
How much ?
Purple?
Bright red!
Oh yeah.
Bright purple !
!
I can't do much, sort of, colouring, someone's taken .
Well it's all black
apart from that bit there's white.
that will be white, yeah.
You imagine like a penguin suit, aren't the wings?
 
Different colours  aren't they?
No I thought they were all black 
No they're not are they?
They're just
Yeah.
a piece here was white  but you want to do 
I'm gonna do a  !
colour in the eye, colour on the beak, colour on feet
Yeah

little red buttons and stuff 
and the yellow.
Yeah.

our little red flower on the hat.
Yeah I've got a little bit of silver and gold at home actually, but I didn't bring it in today 
Yeah.
I should've done, but 
I think I'll do this like  reds, and blacks and 
okay.
whites an 
So decide  your work before hand 
Yeah, that'll do.
Brown.
Okay?
Right 
Right if you didn't pay attention there, I don't see any others from next door because  the colour they can start with 
Mhm.
do it like that  you need a piece of paper and lots of water  and I'll just go and get brushes .
Where are they , in the corridor  down there?
Yeah.
I don't know what colour to do it.
We  
And I've lost my tape!
Oh  don't wanna 
We could dig around it.
Not all  I'll go  .
Bit of everything!
Yeah but if you if you 
If you have the pale, I suppose.
That one will look alright.
It looks alright though.
What do you want ink on?
The tail  gonna have to do the tail now.
Well never mind, maybe
I didn't think they had one.
They've only got a little stub though haven't they?
Yeah.
Are you sure one of these isn't  yours ?
   
Don't erm don't 
That's a really nice man.
?
Yeah today, running round 
I think a light green actually.
Very pale I think.
Actually that's a sort of a murky green.
That'll do.
Oh god I think that's gonna look really good.
I wanna varnish it as well cos I  
Oh look at that red!
Yeah.
That's good actually.
So red here  colour.
What do you think?
Red here
Yeah.
Black and white

Where?
What colours are you doing it Emm?
Apparently you don't need much of that green, Fiona.
Apparently it goes a long way.
Ugh.
That's really sort of splurched now.
It's always the white that comes out splurchy isn't it?
There you go.
Have fun.
Your hedgehog's gonna look really nice when it's coloured.
In only wanna give this a mix.

Only if you want it to.
Oh.
No I don't.
Good.
It's  isn't it?
It's shiny at the moment.
If you want it shiny  if you want it like erm  If you want it to come out like this.
Alright?
Then you put the 
Yeah.
No I don't.
shiny varnish on it that brings the colour back out.
Don't forget to do your nose.
Can I paint over the eyes and then go over them again?
Oh yes.
Keep your brush wet.
Sarah, have you got some water?
do the wings a different colour or something.
Sorry.
Mm?
Think I'm gonna do the wings a different colour.
Have you got water there ?
Yeah well keep it wet and then it'll sort of flow into any difficult areas.
Don't  try not to put your paint on too thick.
Alright?
Just working out how I'm gonna get this done.
. Just working out how to paint the wings black.
Yeah cos I was gonna, I was gonna do this like  
Oh I see you only want the wings black?
As such really but I was gonna 
Alright.
Well let's er let's draw it on then in pencil .
Oh I like that colour.
Bit bright isn't it?
Put flowers all over them.
Yeah  
 
You need to have a line to work to really don't you?
What I was gonna do was  the front here was gonna be red yeah?
Yeah.
Black and white.
Yeah.
And I was gonna carry and bring his coat to sort of like down there.
I was gonna work out, how am I gonna get red to go over the black?
So you want  so all this is red?
Yeah.
Oh what was that that fell off?
Like that.
Yeah.
So all that can be black and that can be red yeah?
But where would you take the black ?
Well all that
His head's gonna be white.
That wants to be black?
Yeah black.
I've never varnished any clay before.
All I've done is use  because we couldn't have any  at school.
gonna be black down to there?
Yeah.
But I'm doing his head in white.
What the back of his head?
No that's gonna be 
Well this wants to be red.
Red yeah.
Then there wants to be a white band  like it's collar.
See he doesn't really want much brown on him he just needs a coat.
Don't like this colour now.
Well I'm not putting it, I'm putting other colours on top of it.
Oh that's alright then.
Purple and that.
That's red.
That's black.
That's yellow.
Yellow.
Do you see what I mean?
Yeah.
Unless I mean this hedgehog could have been done if I left it  couldn't it?
Okay?
Yeah.
That's black 
Okay?
Yeah.
And what colour's his hat gonna be?
Probably red.
Okay.
black with a red band.
If you like you could open one of those little wheels if it, especially a difficult one like yours Emma.
It might be a good idea.
I'll go and get you one.
Thanks.
Sorry did I get you?
No it's alright.
I just wiped it all over my .
I was just about to say I expect you could really make a mess if you tried and then I realized I was covered in  and I'd better shut up.
As long as the fire alarms don't go off I don't mind.
Oh  twice  
Again.
Well Wednesday when I was in, I teach up until five on a Wednesday and kept  coming up and saying that all the lights were gonna go off.
That the electricity board was doing some work  so not to get the class started.
Well no-one ever knew that the fire alarms were going off.
No-one at all.
I think someone was just taking the mickey and kept setting them off.
Well they went off twice.
I think they must have done  
Right.
Well from here I can see all sorts of bits so I suggest if you get 
Yeah I know.
Let's put erm a piece of paper 
How am I gonna ?
on there and then you'll be able to  sorry Emma I didn't hear what you said.
How am I gonna paint under that black
Very carefully  
without getting the red red and the red
Well if you hold a piece of paper there.
Yeah?
Get a small piece of paper and hold there as you do it.
Thing is every spike's gonna be changed a different colour anyway so.
Yeah but you want to  make sure you haven't got any
under here.
Right.
Before you finish doing that just lift it up and paint in round under here look.
You've got a
Got a line.
bare bottom.
That's the sort of colour you want for the top of your  isn't it?
Yeah.
Right.
If you want to use another colour just check round and see what other people have got, alright?
Cos it's pointless keep making up loads of paints when other people have already mixed the colour up.
And share the colours.
bits.
As my children say.
You must co-operate.
Watching too much Sesame Street.
Co-operation  
Is that from Sesame Street is it?
Yeah.
Oh right.
I think I was probably watching too much Sesame Street as well.
 
Oh.
I'm getting his eyes.
There we go.
Right.
How do I paint in there then?
What do you 
Right.
There and there and there and underneath.
My frog is called Basil.
get a small piece of paper  
What about the hedgehog?
Harry  isn't it?
 
paint that side you see.
And then it won't go on to this side.
Are you with me?
Yeah.
Basil the tree frog.
Okay?
So you can get the brush in  goes against the paper.
Yeah but the thing is  
I'm sorry Emma it had to be done.
Well you'll just  very carefully.
I mean if it's right at the back it doesn't matter if it's black or red.
It's just gonna  shadow anyway.
Yeah.
Okay?
Oh my god  
This is not gonna be fun  all his spikes.
I'm just going to wash my brush.
 
I think you ought to put flowers all over him.
 
Daisies.
Yeah why not?
Lovely colour 
Big pink ones.
Go for it.
Orange.
Why not?
Be creative.
Look at my hedgehog.
He should be brown but he's not.
Go on Eva.
Be a daredevil.
It's lucky it's not actually a boy now.
I was gonna say if you had flowers on it it'd be a bit 
bit .
Ooh.
That's nice!
Mm.
Basil the tropical free  free I keep saying, tree frog.
He's gonna have some colours on top of them .
Thing is I bet you the spikes that goes exactly next door to him I'll paint yellow.
What colours are frog's nails 
Pinky.
Pinky red   You could have flowers all over your frog as well.
We could have a real  hippie parade couldn't we?
Hippie frog.
Oh no.
I've got black on it.
This is the last lesson this term isn't it?
Is it?
Yeah.
Oh we've got next term haven't we?
How many lessons have we got after term?
Four I think.
Emma.
Can I use a bit of your glue?
Just a teeny bit.
Emma was that?
What do you want?
Can I have a tiny bit of your glue.
You may.
What are they to finish painting and do a bit 
Inside?
Dark green?
Do some  
Or pink  or red.
Er it depends on how much you want to make it stand out.
I think I would probably do it dark green.
Dark green, mm.
Sort of colour Emma's  that that colour without being altered is is fine.
Yeah.
Do it with a small brush.
Alright.
Or you know  sludgy sort of colour like  this
I think I'm gonna do it dark green.
This is gonna look well weird.
I need a brush with a bend in it to get under here.
Yeah.
That's what I need too.
I love this hippo.
This is really .
I love the shape of his legs.
He's lost a tooth 
Has he?
Ah!
He's been to the dentist.
Well you must stick it, you must stick it back in there.
Right  so let's have a go.
This has got to be red.
Yeah this is gonna be fun.
It's gonna be like a jigsaw puzzle.
Keep your brush wet Fiona and then the colour will sort of flow in there.
He was nearly a dead hedgehog then because he nearly fell off the table.
Yeah do him as an old hedgehog.
We got a hippie hippo.
An old hedgehog.
What makes brown?
Green and?
Don't know.
Don't know.
You might as well just get a brown.
No I want to make it.
Green and yellow makes brown.
Red and black.
Not red and black.
Red and black make brown as well don't they?
Subtle colour.
When they find out yours is broken though.
What's broken?
Quite, quite a few of them but I mean  
Caroline's blew up.
Caroline's blew up .
Poor old Caroline.
He had a happy life though Caroline.
Yeah.
Met with a grisly end, but 
I don't think so actually Sarah.
Yes I did as well.
Yeah.
I was choosing to ignore it.
Right.
I need to get under his  
No I can't get this bloody thing done.
I don't care I'm just gonna paint it and go over it.
I had enough .
I just painted it and I'll go over it with the black.
Does this paint smell of  or is it my imagination.
I haven't really smelt it yet Fiona.
Yeah it does.
Yours does.
There you go.
Oh it stinks.
Oh no.
No no no no no.
Quick 
give it a mix if you don't mind.
This is your white here look.
No  god no.
Got me brush.
You might as well use me paint.
Only joking.
put red in his mouth.
Yeah but don't give him rubber lips.
I'm gonna rub powder paint in all over it and see what happens.
She didn't recognize her erm owl cos it had shrunk.
Oh  isn't it tiny?
She remembered it as being bigger.
Oh oh 
Oh it's really tiny isn't it.
Oh it's really dainty.
Oh right.
What colour can I do now, brown?
You can do whatever colour you want .
Mine's a tropical free trog.
Free trog.
I've said it again.
Free trog 
Where's the palette things or whatever you call them?
In that  cupboard over there that's open.
This'll look quite nice when he's shiny though won't it?
Yeah, I'm gonna do mine shiny.
Frogs are wet aren't they?
Mine's not.
Mine's gonna be 
You gonna do yours  brown then?
I don't know.
If I do him brown or put in white all round 
You can do
all round there.
You can put, do brown and put colours on the top or you can do him any colour and then put  any colour on top.
powder paint on the top.
You can rub it in.
Rub it in, yeah.
brown and then I'll do all round his face white.
Can I borrow your paintbrush ?
Yeah all the paintbrushes are over here.
You've got my little brush I want.
Oh sorry.
I might do this last actually the eyes and I'll go back and do them when they're dry.
Do you want the black?
Yeah.
Okay that's got black 
Oh that's looking lovely.
I'm gonna do the eyes when it's finished because the white went all splodgy cos I couldn't get the brush in even though I had a tiny brush.
Right.
paint in his nostrils?
Yes.
And I'm gonna paint red in his mouth as well.
Now this.
Where there's lines that just lends itself to having a dry paint rubbed down it.
Yeah that's what I'm gonna have  put on.
I want to use that little bit of gold as well to  just sort of 
Yeah.
Shimmy shimmy shimmy.
Shimmy shimmy gold.
All the  powder paints are in the cupboard next to the sink in that room.
Right.
Okay.
Alright?
Now careful as you pick the packets up because some of them are so old.
Ugh!
Now this is where you really must   wet cos then it flows  
will not go green.
Oh I found a .
Let's do him green.
You done any little fleas on it yet?
No that's gotta go green cos this has gotta be green.
You're gonna come on Saturday aren't you Michelle?
Yeah I'm  Thursday Friday and Saturday I've got it so  it means that
Er  is that too big, that spike?
What colour's frog's eyes, black?
Last time Roger was outside waiting for me for an hour and a half 
Suppose so, yeah.
I hope this stuff comes off.
I've got it all over my jumper.
Oh no what an arsehole!
Painted those bits wrong.
Right.
Anybody stuck for a minute?
That's it.
Fat little cow.
Oh that's really good.
Let's have a look .
Round the other way.
Ah!
Ah that's lovely.
He's got red on his neck so 
What's the red gonna be?
The red's gonna be  there down the back.
That one's gonna be white.
Well  is there anybody else who's mysteriously lost a piece of work.
Who's left it in the 
And the red where?
No idea.
I really don't.
I don't know at all.
I don't know.
She's buggered off again hasn't she?
Oh she's coming back.
Oh he looks brilliant  Mikila.
By the way,
What?
Oh  Do you reckon 
No  red.
Really clash as well.
Ooh!
Red and purple!
The examiner will think she's colour blind.
Well she could be  for all we know.
Right no other mix ups.
I thought you said she could be.
I didn't say anyone.
I said the examiner thought she could be.
You said she.
Yeah.
She could be as in either.
Could be a bloke 
Yeah I know he could but I  I said she, I said either.
Erm  it's not working quite how I wanted it to but if I keep putting stuff on then
I think the yellow's a bit strong.
Yeah.
I'll  stick something over it and  knock it 
This is just a mess now.
I should have just done it green.
State of it.
It looks nice.
I hate it.
That's really good.
Mm.
The nails are too long to do this actually.
Mm.
Sometimes I wonder if he's cross-eyed or not.
Maybe it just  
Oh crap.
It's disgusting.
. It's not.
It's just a mess now.
Mm I don't like it though.
I know.
I'll have the dragon and you have 
Does it wash off?
No.
Yeah well at least I'd get rid of it and then start again.
And then just paint green over it.
 
What time does this lesson end?
Quarter past .
Blimey.
Who's got that brown colour?
Have you Lise?
Does that look cross-eyed to you from there?
Let's have a look.
Oh it's me then.
  

Where is she?
Quick Sarah.
Mop it up  bring her in.
browns.
pretend they're using brown.
What time is it?
Ten to three?
Oh.
Oh no I've just started a colour that I'll never ever be able to find again.
What time do we finish?
Yeah.
Don't finish till quarter past Michelle.
Don't panic.
Twenty minutes yet.
Panic when you've got five.
I think it  nice.
I don't know.
I think it looks just looks just just a mess  now.
 
Right.
Are you absolutely sure there's nothing ?
Anything else for
Only my rabbit.
Yeah, it's gone in.
First thing in.
Good.
He's got a hole in him?
Yeah.
You sure?
Well it better have cos it's right at the back of the kiln at the bottom and I don't 
What  shall I put anything else on there?
Cos I was gonna use  colours but I don't know if it's going to  or not now.
Well I think it looks really nice.
Tell you what I would do is mix some slightly different colour green 
By the way his  fell out.
Mm.
that's a slightly lighter colour.
What about his nostrils?
Yeah I mean just a few different should  you use a little bit of green powder paint.
Alright?
Yeah.
Just add a little bit  
Right.
There we are.
If you don't like it you can wash it off and start again.
Oh good.
Oh there's one.
What colour should that be?
Which one?
The white one.
Blue.
But the next one next door to that's blue.
So I can't do it .
Oh.
Cos I say there's blue on it, oh god I can't be  can't be any of them.
Oh god!
Can't you do like   another colour?
Brown.
No.
It's gotta be  I'll have to change.
Which one's going blue?
That one's blue and I'll have to change that one won't I?
That'll have to go red.
How annoying.
Has anybody any white powder paint?
No.
No?
White, I've got white squeezey here.
Yes.
This one's had to have a  transfer.
There's a tiny bit in this cup here.
What, white?
Yeah.
only wants a tiny bit.
Just a tiny bit.
Mikila's got some .
Right so that's all the rest of your stuff's gone in the kiln now apart from Louise's other piece.
So anything that hasn't been fired will be  may be fired by the end of next week so it'll be ready for you at the beginning of next term.
Okay?
lesson anyway.
Ah.
That goes on there.
Yeah I'm just saying that it will be ready next term.
That's gotta be green.
So's that.
Right.
Does that look okay?
Mm.
Though red is the  the best colour to come up with the varnish.
It really does come up .
What, with the shiny varnish?
No either.
You don't have to erm  I mean you could also  only put varnish on certain bits of it.
We've got a matt varnish 
I'm not having much luck painting round 
That's red.
What colour's  
Keep your brush a little bit wetter .
Oh that goes there.
That's another one.
This frog looks really nice Fiona.
Fiona  this looks really nice.
I'll have to have a rest.
My back's 
Yes.
stupid, it's freckles.
Wonderful.
So gormless .
Let's just have the er  tiny brush a minute .
He's a wide-mouthed frog .
He likes Maltesers.
Yeah that's brilliant 
It's such a shame Emma.
Yeah but it still looks nice.
Gotta get  
Got more character now.
bit of brown just under there .
Yeah I know.
I'm going to do like  right.
We've got to have some here.
Is that it now?
Do you think?
Apart from his other toenail.
Mm.
I think so.

Thank you.
Getting the knack of these.
There you go then.
Thankyou.
finish doing his toenails.
Oh there's a splendid job.
Wonderful.
It looks so much nicer, painted doesn't it?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna varnish it.
shiny  
Are you a bit happier with it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
When I glue these 
You didn't seem to like it very much before.
No I didn't.
I wanted it to come out  
When I glue these 
paint over it again  if it's necessary    
Are you happier with him now?
Mikila?
What's that?
You happier with him now?
No.
I was gonna say if you bring it in.
Cos we're not supposed to have the strong glues and it's so much easier 
Little bit.
Will superglue do it?
Mm.
I've got superglue at home.
So  what I suggest you do  is 
Yeah.
Cos he'll look better when he's got  his spikes on him
Yeah.
and his  varnish 
All of those work.
I mean superglue is  superglue is brilliant .
We're not  we're not supposed to have it in here.
Oh.
So I couldn't bring it in?
Well yes, you could.
I mean it's just like it's  You know, obviously you're not going to  stick each other to the 
Well I mean you might do.
I don't know but 
That's the yellow one.
Unless it's properly supervised at all times.
Eh?
I can put it back  
Finished?
Oh let's see.
Turn round.
. That's sweet.
I think the inside of the mouth wants to be a bit more contrast, don't you?
Yeah.
Let's have a look Kim.
What do you think?
Turn it round and show Maggie.
I think the inside of the mouth ought to be a bit darker.
the box is in the way .
Don't you?
Yeah.
Bit darker.
Let's have a look, Kimbo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Looks like we've all decided.
Decided for you.
And also you've missed a bit.
Right, come on.
Somebody help me find these final  spikes.
That one's going yellow.
Well  .
It just wants to look darker inside.
That one can be blue.
You need a little hand coming out and a little bubble saying help 
That could be green.
Shall I do his dickie bow black or red?
What are you doing to that green?
Fiona are you using your green?
What?
Your green.
Mm.
I don't know.
That one?
Or what?
No I'm using  at the moment.
What do you think Mikila?
Dickie bow 
The dickie bow?
Or grey.
No.
It's gotta be a bright colour.
You want it bright.
Is that powder?
No.
Purple.
There's the powder paints there.
Have you got the green you used to ?
Just use that little bit of green on there look.
On the edge of the saucer.
Oh  get your brush clean.
Erm  I don't  doesn't want to be black.
I don't think it wants to be red.
It'll have to be green.
Yeah.
Bright green.
Or yellow.
Bright yellow.
next door.
Mm?
The  's next to it.
Right.
It's got to be the green then.
Green and green buttons.
Yeah?
That's red.
Green buttons?
Oh no.
What've I done?
Or black buttons perhaps, on the white shirt.
I don't know.
I'll see 
That's yellow.
Okay do the green then.
Then see what that looks like.
Okay.
I would use  I would use that green .
I should think that's quite nice.
Yeah.
too bright.
I've run out of spikes.
Look there's loads more in there.
They're all too big.
the ends off.
Finished 
Yeah.
Let's have a look.
You can't really see it actually .
That's well cute.
The back leg  nearest Emma.
That one, looks as if it's never been painted I think.
It 
Oh!
That's nice.
What's the matter?
You want some red wool or something don't you?
I'm gonna paint him in a bright colour 
Let's have a look.
I'm gonna paint him in a really bright colour and then put the
Oh it looks nice.
Do you reckon that'll look alright, or do you think I should paint them brown?
I don't like it like that though, so 
I dunno.
I'm being fussy I know but
Paint him a bright colour and then  
But it's just weird.
I don't like it at all.
If I paint a bright colour over the top of it  then that'll go sort of weird won't it?
Yeah.
So I'll do it like that.
I might use purple actually, I like the purple.
As long as it doesn't go black.
But I don't wanna use it .
Well make a different
orange.
Bright orange.
I'm gonna do a bright orange dragon.
Let me go and put this back and then 
He's gonna get a complex that, that dragon .
what I'm gonna do now.
Erm Eva, can you pass me the  persil please?
Do you want this brush?
Mikila?
Yeah that's fine.
Ooh yeah.
That'll do.
I'll just file them down a bit.
Yeah it's quite runny actually.
But  
 
What colour you doing it then?
Purple.
But I'm gonna do it over this so it'll sort of go funny
Oops.
Sorry.
Oh dear.
It's alright .
Why don't you kind of dabble it on, Mikila?
Yeah.
Rather than 
sponge.
You mean like that  dabble it on?
Yeah.
Or a bit less?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos then some of the other colours are gonna come through and I can put the little bit of gold on the top.
Yeah.
Okay?
Okay, mm.
Let me just er
Yeah.
Wipe that down there.
I don't think these spikes belong on there at all.
Mm?
He's got a wobbly bottom.
hedgehog.
You gonna actually paint the icing white?
Or is it 
Oh right.
I was  that yellow.
That yellow.
Yes.
That white one there everybody.
Too big.
Stick it further down.
It can be the centrepiece.
Stick it further down so 
Well a lot of the spikes are 
Right.
If you've finished  or if you've finished for today.
This  paint I want it really really really well washed out of these brushes.
It's erm very good covering powder, it actually stays in the brushes.
So, give the brush a really good wash out, put it back into it's proper pointed shape.
Alright?
If you would please.
When you're ready.
Oh it's hotting up.
be your own creative flower.
Little Eva.
an Eva flower.
Oh hell.

Yeah.

Oh he's lovely.
Well you can't say he's  
Let's have a look Mag.
Are you var er shining him up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He'll look really sweet. 
I keep doing it wrong so  I gave up and I'm just covering it with purple.
Then I'm going to put lots of gold bits on.
May I have some white paint  please?
Eva?
Sorry.
Do you think you could make it by half past?
So as I can get done what we want to do.
Oh yeah.
Okay?
It won't come out on his eyes.
That's beautiful.
Just had a bit of a catastrophe.
All his spikes fell off 
So he's gotta be glued and
and glue, they've all gotta be glued on him.
Has he got a flower on it?
Yeah.
You could put it over that  big scar thing on it.
That big line.
You could put a flower on it's nose to cover it up.
Put it on it's bum.
No it's had a bit of a  fight hasn't it?
It's a rough, tough hippo.
Do you need any more black, Emma?
Or have you got black there.
Oh look at his eyes!
They look really  pooped.
Let's have a look.
drunken hedgehog then.
Looks like you then doesn't it?
Oh thanks!
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go  while it's wet.
