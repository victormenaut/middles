You have to watch, make sure you're getting the stones out of it.

The jam, the jam, the jam.
I think my jam has been.
No, I I think it would be a wee bit more personal than, than, than just brotherly love and that.
I really do.
He sa sounded alright, like you know.
Bit of a, bit of a, bit of a brogue.
Might have been her daddy even.
No it wasn't her dad.

I spoke to him quite a bit you know.


Why?
Were you 
Cos you answered the phone.
Aargh!
And who was it?

He didn't say, and I says can I take a message?
We didn't give him the  message.

I can't snip them when there's nothing of them.
You can!


Well you snip them at the growing time.
It's only a stick!
Well that's all they are, a stick!
Well they'll grow.
You know I  years ago I  had a twig  you know, an ordinary twig, I stuck it into the ground  after three long years, all that was was a stick!
Yeah.
Obviously.
And  but it was starting to grow  and it's still only a stick, and it's got a bud  on the top .




So the stick will bud.
Did you ask David about any cleaning stuff?
He didn't have anything.
But it's still only one stick, there's nothing .
It's just a stick!

It's a stick!
Mm!
Well everyone kept saying wha , what's that there?
Aye, I know.
It's a stick.
I think we'll take it out now.
But it'll be a bit of a shame because  in  you know 
Probably flower or something.
in a couple of years it never done a thing  and now it's growing.
