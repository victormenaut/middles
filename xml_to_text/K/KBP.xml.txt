and you switch it on before they arrive.
Yes.
Mm.
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But no it, it doesn't bother me.
I don't mind you know on camera, I don't mind being on video, anything.
But in fairness to your friends Larry, you can hardly 
Warts and all.
Mm.
Oh no no.
do that and then
I know 
You've got 
I can't see Mike and Robin making  a cake  , can you?
No.
No but
Not , no no no.
Robin necessarily but  just  temperaments  
I don't know but well I remember going out  shopping and when I came back you'd got
Jill.
you'd gone out.
No they were, they were all of them there.
Were they?
Nan and I were out shopping.
When we got back
Mm?
it was christmas shopping I think.
Mm.
Anyway  you'd been out and bought one of those m packets of m cake mix.
Oh it would be ready mixed, yes .
Well  and they'd made little buns.
They were very nice really.
Oh it's a tribute to the
The state of the kitchen wasn't.
Well  that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer, sure.
Mm well I rem 
And Robin and L and erm  Carol doing that er cabbage  cabbage 
Oh that revolting 
That was horrible.
That was terrible.
I remember Jill though.
I don't remember the mix but mm I don't know that, I vaguely remember now, yes but
Oh they were all there
Mm.
because we'd gone out, I think it was the christmas shopping we were doing on our own.
Was it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yes I've got a hazy recollection but .
Mm.
Jill'll remember.
But she was a lot younger surely, Jill?
And she'd be a bit 
Oh she'd be young, erm
Younger than them I mean.
They weren't, oh they were younger than Carol Caroline and erm Ken.
Mm mm mm.
Mm.
But then  look at Chris.
He must have been interested in cooking, mustn't he?
I don't  Chris 
No I think the young fellows today are more because of course they go into the flats don't they?
Mm well that's true of course.
I remember when Mike and Robin went into their flats I  spent quite a long time with them 
Yeah I know.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Showing them how to do simple dishes.
Mhm.
But erm  quite frankly I can't see myself ever getting  given the same sort of circumstances.
Well n no.


I can't either.
Knowing you I   no it's laughable.
Yeah.
Can't imagine you meeting me with a nice cooked dinner and a  a cake  made by yo your own fair 
No I 
with a candle on .
No.
Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something, not 
Burnt toast.
Ah no, it's not really burnt, it's the way I like it though.
Must admit technically 
Well it used to smoke.
Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but  well done I  
Well it doesn't taste very nice.
I can't agree cos I, that's how I like it.
And the s Well you used to scrape some of it off because it was all over the  
Oh if it gets really charred I know but


if it's really charred that's a bit  

Certain degree of grey blackness even but 
And how d'you get toast  charred so that you've got to scrape it off but it isn't burnt?
Oh I 
Well leaving it that little bit too long, you know.
 

Remember Ro Robin coming home   I don't believe it, burnt  burnt toast  from an electric toaster.
I don't know how he does it.
I don't know.
Mm.
Oh well.
Doesn't feel like Sunday  does it?
No.
I've not seen any more sight of that heron.
No.
I don't, I think it was just a flash in the pan.
I don't think, well.
I don't think  I'm certain there's not 
I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly.
I do.
I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er
Well I don't feel like having a plastic heron.
Well I mean how do all the rest of the pond they've not all got bloody herons, plastic herons perched on the side have they?
No.
Plastic  
But you know d'you remember me going round the corner and seeing that erm 
Mm.
Mm.
pond with all those plastic ducks on?
Flipping ducks on it.
Yeah I know.
That might have been some  deterrent of some description.
I don't think so somehow.
That was just  
but I'm n I'm certainly not having little plastic ducks 
Art nouveau.
and  little gnomes about.
Mm.
That's interesting er  that erm  comment Steve made about the  postcard.
And the bird of prey silhouette, you know?
I can 
Mm.
believe that being  rather effective.
Well actually I have read about the heron that er I think was it  I'm not sure that  
What the plastic  plastic heron ?
Oh  yes.
Mm.
Mm.
No way.
Mm.
But that silhouette business, that could work you know.
Mm.
I can see that working.
Birds of prey.
Well  really when you think, it's only the same way as  er laying the hose amongst your flower beds.
For cats.
Oh the snake you mean?
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm  I've still to have that proved to me to be honest.
It's a damn great snake 
Well I have.
isn't it?
If you think about it.
Yes.
Well I think  well, you know when we used to leave ours across the, the lawn there?
Mm, yeah.
Well S 
Cat didn't bother.
Samba no he
No.
Well he did a he did for a bit.
Are you sure?
Yes, I've watched him sort of er  warily 
Waiting 
walk round.
But then he got so used to it that he didn't bother.
Mm, yeah.
That's what I mean.
It may, if it's any effect at all it's very short lived I think.
Mm.
I don't think pepper's a very useful deterrent.
I've sprinkled loads of 
No.
pepper round.
One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway.
Mm.
I'd have thought.
Mm.
I think the only deterrent is putting  netting or something over it but er
Mm.
you can't put netting over your whole garden can you?
It's silly.
No no.
We'll have to watch that pond though   leaves next year.
Mm.
Well this year of course.
Mm.
Well I can't really see what you can do, only have netting over that when the leaves start to fall.
Well yes  I could be a little bit more erm  atten attentive to the damn thing couldn't I?
We need to sca scrape quite a lot of that out but erm  not all by any means.
See a certain percentage have blown in I think off the grass and if I had some sort of a 
I was just er yeah.
I was just gonna say that.
Mm.
Mm.
I think our problem here is it gets so windy with being on the corner.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
D'you want any more tea?
Oh yes please.
But I think  mm  mm.
That was a silly question wasn't it?
It was unnecessary wasn't it?oh yes I'll want a bit of a hand then.
With  the top window
Yeah.
I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment.
As we did,painting the outside yeah.
Yes.
I it won't blow out though?
No not at all.
I'm gonna hold it while you take the two final screws out.
Oh I see.?
Yeah.
Cos it's almost impossible to get at it.
It won't erm  I think
What?
once you've got the window done it won't be too bad will it?
You mean the whole frame?
Mm.
And the opening light?
Mm.
It won't be too bad, will it?
Oh I mean, what I mean is you've not
Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left.
There's only  one skirting board  and the pipe cover.
Mm.
The casing round the other cupboard.
Mm.
And that's it I think.
And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors, I don't know.
Yes, they're not very brilliant.
No.
Mm certainly want cleaning up.
I may end up taking them off completely though.
I think that may be easier to do  rather than do them in situ, you know?
Are you going to have a piece of cake?
Oh yeah.
Mm.
He's done this in two  and then sandwiched them together.
What two cakes and put them together, he's?
Yes.
Well I used to do that.
Mm.
It's quite good though.
Mm.
I'm trying to remember, did they have any, the kids?
Erm
I know they cut some for them but 


It's a wonder Caroline didn't.
No.
She usually stuffs doesn't she?
Mm.
Well yes.
Mm.
Did Jill say what time Caroline's appointment was?
No.
Er well  not to me she didn't.
No well.
She pro she might have done to me but I can't remember.
In the afternoon.
They seem very confident they'll be back in time don't they?
Twenty five to four to meet  young
Yeah.
Pick him up at twenty five to four.
There's a heck of a lot of burning off when you come to think of all the burning off of paint we're going to have to do.
Oh god I know.
You're telling me.
But then 
Where possible I'll sand down obviously but there's  there 
Yes but usually 
won't be many places I'd have thought.
There isn't.
It's
No.
Cos it's been piled on so
Yeah.
I can't get over that screw in the woodwork.
I know!
Good god.
I've seen dust before but  and bits of fluff and rag and stuff but I've never seen a bloody, and a nail  damn great screw!
Well it's the same as the, the way they've papered the walls round.
They've just papered over things.
You know?
They've papered over,I know .
I know.
Mm.
It wouldn't have been, if they'd had any furniture in when we, when we first got in  I wouldn't have been surprised to see it painted round there as well.
Oh the  you mean?
Oh aye.
mm.
Mm.
Mm.
No, coming back to the  .
I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can but 
Oh yeah.
all those splodges of white  are putty.
Are they?
Mm.
Unfortunately.
And there's nothing at all you can cover them with?
Well  except to take them out.
Scrape the bits of putty out    and put some  filler in that will accept stain.
I think that'd be better.
Mm.
But that's a  fairly long  job though.
Er yes, but I mean it it  it would be worth it.
Mm.
See it won't accept stain anyway  with that varnish on.
Well I don't like this colour stain anyway.
Well I don't.
It's a nasty colour.
You can't burn that off though.
It's dust.
You couldn't 
What?
just give a dab of paint over?
A dark paint.
It'd stand out a mile wouldn't it?
Would it?
Well  perhaps not as  obviously 
Well if you did it with a small brush?
Well it would still stand out wouldn't it cos it's a different colour?
Mm.
Not as 
You don't 
not as obvious perhaps as the white but 
That's what I mean.
Mm.
Mm.
But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it'll take any other stain.
Mm.
See what it's like.
I  what it's like when?
When you've got rid of the varnish.
Mm.
I may have to use varnish stripper.
Get a kind of varnish stripper for it.
Well it might be better than erm  doing it any other way because
I don't think it'll burn off.
No I'm thinking of the fumes.
After all the other fumes I don't think that'll matter.
After what?
After the fumes of the paintwork, I don't think that'll 
Won't that be worse than ?
No.
Not as bad as.
No no.
Oh.
Cos I remember when you did twenty seven.
Mm.
Ah well that was a varnish paint.
That was quite 
That was a varnish paint.
And that won't, that'll just be   stain?
Varnish.
No.
It is a stain varnish.
In other words varnish, with a stain added to the varnish before you apply it.
Mm.
As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with 
Oh I see.
relatively clear varnish.
Mm.
Once we've got those tiles off at the bottom there
Mm?
well we might as well paint  
Well I think, I mean they're very nice, it would rather, I'd prefer to, it would be nice to have  tile there to break it , but not those damn things and they certainly won't come off and go back.
They're a bit messy aren't they?
Mm.
One two three four five six seven eight, twenty four.
Two dozen.
Mm.
How many did we get in the pack?
The pack.
I don't know .
I think it was twenty five.
I really don't know.
Oh it varies, the pack doesn't it?
Mm.
Think it is twenty five actually.
pack anyway .
But erm  finding the right tile .
Yeah.
In any case you don't want them all the same do you?
I think we're better off just snapping it off.
Wonder what state the wall's in?
Doesn't really matter all that much.
I'd skim over the plaster anyway.
Mm.
Be a right mess won't it?
Mm.
It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway.
Mm I was just thinking that.
mm.
I mean the way, what have they done here?
Well what have they done anywhere?
Mm.
Well they ran short of tiles or they ha they wouldn't be bothered cutting.
I bet 
That's more likely the case.
Mm.
One two three four 
Twenty four.
five six seven eight 
Twenty four on this front face wasn't there?
Yes, there was three more there.
Mm.
So that ma er in any case they'd of got  some of it being the two colours.
Yeah.
It looks quite effective .
Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly, yes.
As it is now it's bloody awful.
Have you had some cake?
Er no I'll give it a  miss right now thankyou.
I'm a bit full  from my sandwich.
No I I'll enjoy it more 
 
later on.
No no.
Mm.
Cup of tea would go down like a bomb but
you've not eaten it.
Possibly yes.
Mm.
Mhm.
I meant to ask, oh 
Aha aha.
Pardon?
Right.
Right.
Pardon?
Er oh yes, yes I have actually.
Let's put this cake back in its tin.
I'll have a cup of tea then bash on with my window then I think.
Well the sooner it's finished 
Well, yes because it is at least dry today.
Mm.
But erm  It's gonna make a hell of a racket sanding down afterwards you know.
Well it can't be helped.
No it can't be helped, no.
I'll probably have to get some medium grade paper too.
Cos I've got a lot of gr fine and coarse but 
with us making a row won't they?
I can't think that all that much goes through you know, to be honest.
Obviously 
Yeah well but by and large we've not 
Yeah.
really been on their wall have we?
No that's what I mean.
When we start down here  .
Some of the heavier banging and the, the high pitch  high frequency erm  noises like me drill and erm 
Just keep it down to erm 
Mm.
Mm.
a minimum  keep
Yeah yeah.
not do it late, just keep stopping before it gets too late.
Well exactly what we have been doing.
Cos it is annoying isn't it, you know?
Oh yeah.
But there's not an awful lot you can do is there?
I mean if we had a firm of workmen in they'd  
They'd still do, yeah.
they'd make  more noise  wouldn't they?
Oh rather more noise, yeah.
But erm
And the clatter of tea cups.


But then I was  meant to mention, ask Rachel if she'd seen the photograph cos Mike didn't know  about the two photographs that er Rachel and Louise have taken.
Mm.
Have I given yours, has yours got sugar in?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I'm not sure whether that has ha I can usually tell er I've
Well you claim to be able to.
No I think it's, I can normally, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
I'm glad I found out what that is.
Yeah.
What the hell's it called, a what?
Erm
Something anemone wasn't it?
Anemone  blander 
Oh yes?
February to April.
Requires f the first to flower is A blander.
February to April.
Requires full sun as flowers close in shady conditions.
Mm will it get it there?
Grow it in the rockery  or naturali naturalize it in grassland .
Mm.
That sounds like it.
Well it looks like the illustration doesn't it?
Well it looks li yes.
It does.
Mm.
Mm can go by the leaves, I thought the leaves look like it too.
Well we look like getting, if it spreads 
Has it  yeah 
as much as it has there we look like getting .
Has it got the same number of petals on it?
Yes, it  similar, yes.
It's di , that's di , they differ.
Oh yeah.
Not just the colour and the number of 
Well I'm not sure but I'm not going out to count them.
Well it's .
I would have thought.
Must get some rose fertiliser you know too because erm  I don't suppose the original plants have been fed for generations, literally.
Oh you mean for those ramblers?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well those ramblers and all over the place, mm.
Mm.
It looks to me as if it's going to blooming rain again.
Yeah.
I'm fed up with this weather.
Well it's a good general purpose fertiliser  isn't it?
Yes.
What was the other one?
 Growmore 
Growmore.
No.
Erm
You're the gardening expert.
No I think it was the rose fertiliser, they said use it for the tomatoes as well.
Yeah that's right, yeah.
Ah!
That was right erm  it was the tomato fertiliser wasn't it, that was quite good for something?
As well, er you know as well as the rose fertiliser.
Mm.
Yes, they can use rose fertiliser for tomatoes.
But also tomato fertiliser  apparently is useful for  I don't know.
Look it up at the end of the book.
Incidentally what's this er  operation that Jenny was on about?
Er not Jenny, Josie  was on about this morning that  er Jenny had?
Caesarian.
Oh she had a caesarian did she?
I was forgetting she had a caesarian.
Yes course she has.
That's probably why it's 
Of course.
taken her to get  on her feet .
Of course, good god yes.
I was thinking it was  knit one purl one on the stitches you know, but  mm.
Of course, oh yeah.
Oh yes.
Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm  it is in England somewhere I think   a woman's given birth to a fifteen pound  some ounces kid.
Oh dear me.
Good gracious.
Tremendous size that is isn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
Mind its weight, I don't know about the size but  mm.
We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls don't we?
Over that playing field there.
Well it's being so windy isn't it?
Yeah well I, no I'm generalizing throughout the year.
Well we're not that far from the sea are we?
Of course not, that's true.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh yes but I mean they  they seem to concentrate pretty well round these playing fields for some reason.
blackbird there.
Yeah I know.
the way they land.
Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds, the different methods of landing.
Some are quite accurate.
The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think .
Mm the .
Yeah.
caw caw caw   That looks like an old one to me doesn't it?
An old fella 
Yeah.
Well not an old fella necessarily.
I'm still sort of puzzling  what the best thing, best thing to do for that hedge down there.
Cos we can't er  until we get  it cleared all the way along it  although, it seems to change.
If you look
Hang on.
What seems to change?
The hedge.
If you look from here 
In what way does it ch ?
Well if you look from here
I'm looking from here.
And then you go along.
I'm going along.
By the time it gets to that  all that rubbish that we're going to shift.
Er y oh yes, there in front.
Well then if you look it  tends to change to a different variety  trees.
Oh it does there.
See what you mean.
Yes.
Yeah  
I don't 
it definitely does change doesn't it?
Mm.
I don't know what they are, but one of those trees has little catkins on it.
Very poor.
Yes.
So it obviously 
I'm not surprised  they're poor  .
I know I know.
Mm.
But erm  it wants the roots  clearing
Yeah.
and feeding and
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
It's a shame though to let them die because th they're  I like to have a, a different  I don't want it all the same.
It's  boring isn't it?
Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia aren't you?
That gives interest, especially 
Same 
into the corner.
Mm that's why I don't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too cleanly.
No but I think
Lop it down.
Yes I agree.
Lop it down but erm
I think we need to, for th this time round  because it'll soon get, you know
Take its own  
.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes maybe you're right.
But I do think for now we're just going to have to cu chop it down.
Mm.
It's going to get worse and worse if we don't.
Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter, hedge cutter you know?
Yes.
I looked in the paper to see if there was any.
No there weren't.
They're very expensive to buy aren't they?
Oh new they are certainly yes.
Yes, and you want a double action one?
Preferably.
Not essentially.
I, I wouldn't think that erm  like the different length of the blades.
You don't want a very big one.
I don't think you need the, think it's a twenty four is it?no.
I would think they're more trouble than they're worth unless you've got
Yeah.
They could be.
a great big 
Mm.
Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful too.
Mm.
Yes exactly.
Mm.
Mm.
.
I think that's what  
And again, unless the motor is fairly hefty 
Mm.
it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out.
Because it's doing more work isn't it?
I don't .
Mm well in theory.
A bigger area, bigger length.
You're cutting more at the same time.
Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones.
Good god.
I know.
That's what  I thought.
Stone the crows.
Cor.
It took me breath away so
Good gracious me.
Mm.
No no.
Just how
What?
much  erm  how much can you cut with those as opposed to having  needing  the erm, the other ones that are used for trees.
Erm
Chainsaw ?
chainsaw.
I couldn't, forget the word.
The chainsaw.
Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm  I think, certainly as far as the hedge is concerned
Well I know that.
Yeah hang on.
Hang on.
In a well established hedge like that
Yeah.
I would think er the loppers, if the erm  hedgecutter won't tackle it the loppers will
Yes but what I was thinking more
Mm.
is the rest of the, round there  round at the side there.
I mean a lot of the  you know when we start getting rid of all the rubbish down that side?
Er I wouldn't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there.
That's a little bit too heavy for it.
Which bush?
Well the one  where the hedge terminates and
Mm  well.
That dead looking e well dead 
No.
No but would it do to, I mean you're going to have a lot of the  stuff that we chopped off
Yeah.
to put to, if we're getting a trailer and getting rid of it all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're going to have to cut it down still further into smaller pieces aren't you, to get as much as you can in the trailer?
Oh I see what you mean, to cram on the trailer.
Yes.
Yes yes.
Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert to erm  a chainsaw?
Er  combination of both I should think.
I, well I'm not too concerned about that anyway.
I can use the loppers.
If we were doing it seven days a week, fair enough, you'd probably need a chainsaw but   anything, the loppers or the handsaw.
Oh handsaw?
Oh that's hard work.
No.
No no no no not the really not the thick ones 
Mm.
But erm
Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it.
Mm it's one hell of a lot of work  
But you see we don't really need a chainsaw do we?
No I wouldn't say so normal but er there's quite a lot to  
No.
No.
No.
To hire one possibly for a specific  specific job but
I wonder how much they are to hire?
Not very dear.
Oh aren't they?
What erm chainsaws?
Mm.
I think  last time I looked at the hire list, price, price list
Mm.
I think about  five six quid a day something like that, they were last year.
Mm.
Oh that's not bad really.
Oh it isn't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do.
That can be done in a day you know.
Yeah.
Mm.
Now whether that's erm  including all the protective clothing or not I dunno.
I don't know.
There might be a different charge for that but 
Er did you  think any more about the er  rubbish clearance that was, they were advertising in the paper?
I mean what d'you think?
Oh the  twelve quid's worth wasn't it?
Was it twelve?
Sixteen.
Sixteen quid for one load.
What's a load?
What is, well yes.
Anything that'll fill a skip, it'll be a skip.
Skip .
And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip, I don't know.
I would imagine so.
Did it say from?
What did it just say?
No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I 
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
thought mm I wonder how much a load is.
Well yes, it's probably the smallest skip.
But it'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of it.
See I don't see erm  them shifting very much for that because by the time you've  got a bloke out  paid his wages, paid for the  the erm  skip shifter, transporter you know.
Well if this is a skip.
It might just be a trailer.
It might be a trailer.
It might be an open back lorry, you know.
Mm.
Mm.
A lorry?
Yeah.
Well we could get rid of qu I doubt it whether they're going to shift that 
Well, you know mm.
I doubt that.
But again on a costing basis I mean hourly.
How long is it gonna take a chap to load loads?
Yes but I'm thinking I mean there's so much to do here Larry, you er  you know, you're not a young man any more.
You can't er do too much.
Er I had noticed.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's no good wearing yourself out if you can get anything done 
I was worn out already.
What are you on about ?
You know what I mean.
I'm knackered.
Mm.
But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help.
Oh I'm not adverse to having  bit of help
Mm.
you know of the right sort.
No no no, no no no, no  Erm
You're usually pretty independent.
A little perhaps but er  I mean you can have people that are more damn trouble than they're worth can't you?
Quite honestly.
Mm.
Spend your time watching
Well you know the, all the stuff that you've got  at the side where
Ah well that's straight on the trailer, yeah.
Is it?
Well more, more or less, yeah.
One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it  it's just straight, that's why it's all piled up ready to go.
Ah but I wasn't just meaning on the concrete bit.
I was meaning on the soil.
There's loads and loads of what you trimmed off the .
Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees isn't it?
Well it's still got to be got rid of hasn't it?
Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in, more or less straight in the trailer won't it?
It'll be just like you  to get your trailer and your car down there when er   arrive and .
Oh highly probable.
Sod's law, yes .
I know .
I can't get over the fact that, that all
What?
all through the winter we've had daisies all over the grass.
Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower ?
Mm.
Mm.
You don't usually see daisies do you ?
I honestly don't know Nina.
I don't know.
Mm don't think it's dry enough to cut the grass is it?
Oh I w , no I wouldn't do it today.
No, crikey no.
No I don't think so.
It doesn't look very promising.
No.
Mm.
Mm.
It makes it hard work doesn't it?
Oh yes.
Have to do a bit at a time.
I'm going to investigate, see if I can't do a conv I don't think for one minute I will but it's possible  do a conversion  er into erm  the box type.
Cos that way all the  or most of the cuttings at least, go into the box wouldn't they?
It's possible.
Oh it might be more trouble than it's worth.
It might be.
It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small vacuum cleaner  and cutting the erm 
Ah don't use 
No?
No I, I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly.
Well i it's not a big thing, it's only  you know what I mean don't you?
That yellow and green one?
Yes I know what you mean but I don't fancy you messing about with the  grasscutter.
No
Cos I find it  if there's anything else attached to it 
It depends which mounting.
Keep the centre of gravity low  and there'd be no problems.
No I don't, I can't agree with you there.
Mm.
Maybe not, no.
No, leave well alone.
Mm   
don't you?
And then you just make a mess of what you've already got.
It's quite possible but erm   
Mm but I, I mean I can use it as it is now but anything else on to it I would find it difficult.
Well I'm gonna bash on with the erm
Right, are you ready for the window yet?
Well er yes please.
We can do it now then.
Well I'll come and do that then 
Okay.
Right.
And hopefully by  teatime I should have got the burning done.
Right, away we go.
What's it called   ling 
Ling.
Mm.
Is this the rather uncovered one then?
To erm
No.
No.
We never did  we didn't used to see much of it when we lived up in Manchester.
No that's what I thought yeah.
Mm mm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mm 
We'll soon be able to plant the er  radishes  leeks and  spring onions.
Mm.
Yeah.
We'll have to get a gro-bag.
What, to mix with the soil or?
I need er oh no.
No I meant er not for that, for er 
Oh I see.
re-potting the tomatoes.
Mm.
They're getting to the stage where erm I shall have to prick them on.
Prick them out.
Yeah.
Prick them out!
How on earth d'you remember that, prick them out?
It's a tedious job.
But it's worth it.
Well not really.
I wonder how Jill's are doing?
Mm dunno.
Not a clue it's  
Ours will need staking but hers won't.
With being bush things you mean?
Mm.
What were they like, those ones we had before?
Grew 
Which ones?
Well the ones we grew previously..
What were they like?
Mm.
What d'you mean?
Well  edible wise?
Well you ate them didn't you?
Oh  definitely  I know that but were they pleasant, unpleasant?
Rather nice or  run of the mill or?
Oh they were those little ones.
Little sweet ones.
Oh that's right.
Oh yes I remember those.
Mhm.
They were , I liked those but I can't remember what kind they were.
Mm.
What were those  go on.
D'you remember growing some bush ones though?
A few years ago?
No I don't frankly, no.
And they came out, they looked like peppers.
Mm.
Oh  that's right.
And they weren't very brilliant at all.
I remember growing those on the  roof of the shelter.
What were those?
Ordinary tomatoes were they?
Mm.
Mm.
Moneymaker 
Mm.
These aren't Moneymakers.
I'm not going for Moneymakers.
Any particular reason, or
Well
they won't do well?
because erm when you listen to Gardeners' Questions
Mm?
they advo you know advocate to put different ones in so 
Mhm.
I looked for something different.
Well if you don't try them you never find out do you?
Mm.
Change of weather's  turned the place into a hive of activity hasn't it?
Pardon?
The change in weather, you 
The weather?
Oh yes.
power saw, power drill.
Lawnmowers.
Strimmers.
Brings us out in our thousands doesn't it?
Mm.
The front looks better though.
Erm  oh yes, yes it does.
Mm.
That chap's making a good job across the way you know.
Which one?
Round the corner.
Doing what?
Well he's just rendering the  the house.
He's a builder fair enough but  nevertheless he's doing a good job.
The erm   lives next door to  Anna?
Lisa Anna?
Mm.
Yes they look very nice don't they?
Those er 
Last two houses?
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
Mm chap round the corner  young fella, what maybe in his  late twenties perhaps  a rather seedy, scruffy looking bloke 
Mm?
keeps saying hello, I'm not completely sure where he lives.
He seems to know me cos he erm  when we've been out and   big smile, hello you know?
Oh?
He may be somebody's father or a kid's father, I don't know.
Mm.
When did they do their little run then?
Who?
Lisa.
Oh my god I don't know what   erm  oh well it was toward the end of the week wasn't it?
Yeah.
Was it Thursday?
Oh Wednesday it was going to be.
Mm.
Wednesday, that's right w weather permitting Wednesday .
Mm.
 

It's taking them long enough to
Mm.
come round for their er  spoils isn't it ?
Mm.
Well apparently they've got to have the loot in tomorrow.
Oh.
Or by tomorrow anyway.
the boy ?
Mm.
Well ask him  the next time you see him.
They don't come for the fifty P's now do they?
No.
No.
It could well be the meters have been changed to erm twenty P.
Mm.
Probably have.
I did the lawn twice.
Once one way, cleaned it up  and then did it the o opposite way.
With the grass being so long, you know?
grass  wasn't it.
Oh it was, yeah.
We, we'll have to be feeding it
Mm
too soon.
oh this year definitely.
I'll ask Carolyn what it is that she uses on hers because hers gets rid of the weeds as well.
Oh I know it's a combined fertiliser and weed killer.
And I can't remember what she said it was.
The only weeds we've got to get rid of really are those erm  are they dandelions?
Mm.
Mm.
And I doubt whether it can get rid of dandelions.
Mm she said it does.
really?
Mm.
Oh.
Was it  we went to?
Mm.
With your mother I mean.
Yeah.
Hawthorn Cottage or something.
Hawthorn no  Jasmine House.
Jasmine House, well  Jasmine House.
mm.
Oh did we go  oh go on 
I don't know what  pardon?
I don't know what kind of jasmine it was.
Jasmine nudiflorum  .
Yeah.
Well christ well   Mm.
What's on the magic tonight then?
Haven't looked.
Apart from The Bill that is you know.
You're joking.
It's Monday not Tuesday.
Oh my god so it is.
Do you know I could have sw is it Mo is it Monday?
Oh yes of course it is.
Good grief.
Oh well.
Mm.
I suppose that politics will be mentioned.
We don't go to the school to vote, I was asking Josie.
Oh where do we go?
The erm  village hall apparently.
The village ha oh that place where they had the erm  used goods sale?
Mm.
Mm.
Well I presume that was it.
Mm.
That is the village hall, yeah.
Mm.
Oh   Mm.
It's logical when you think about it cos being a small community
Mm.
you'd be able to cope quite easily there wouldn't you?
Mm.
Why disrupt the school and  shift stuff .
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
She was saying
Mm?
she doesn't know  what she's going to vote, she can't make her mind up.
Mm.
Mm.
I've never been so indecisive as I am this time.
Well I'm quite decisive really.
conservative again.
Are you?
Well I'm not struck on  on Neil Kinnock  Oh Paddy Ashdown'll 
As far as I'm  Paddy  no but the party 
never get in.
No no no no.
That's why people won't vote er a lot of people won't vote for them.
Cos they're considered a wasted vote aren't they?
But erm  you're voting for a party not for a character.
Mm.
Although I don't know, look at Maggie.
Yeah I mean she  for a bit she was the party wasn't she?
Old bossy boots herself.
Mm.
Well she did quite a lot of good in the early days didn't she?
Well she appeared to have done yeah, mm.
Well she put a stop to a load of strikes.
We were on 
 
we used to have these
That was on the way anyway.
Mm.
If she hadn't done it somebody else would have done.
It's a pendulum business isn't it?
No union, downtrodden workers and so  create the unions and  swing the pendulum .
Mm.
I think people were fed up with the strikes Larry.
Well   that.
Even some of the strikers .
Mm.
I mean you've got no choice have you?
No.
If your union came out you were out.
One out, all out .
Mm they  and they had those  the three day weeks when the electricity was off.
Oh yes, that's right.
I'd forgotten about that.
Mm.
of problems.
Mm.
Was really wasn't it?
Mm.
It seemed that Smith has got a better  image than  the present chancellor hasn't he?
Mm.
John Smith?
Mm.
Yes.
Pity he couldn't, doesn't come over better .
He may be quite an able chap.
Mm?
Mm.
He probably is.
I s don't suppose  
Mm.
he'd of got where he is.
No.
Exactly.
Mm  I can't understand why people want to be in politics.
Power.
Mm.
Why do people want to be on the stage?
Mm I know.
Why do people want to be vicars and things?
In the public eye.
What did Ken say, little Ken say he wanted to be?
Erm 
It wasn't an engineer?
No no no.
Erm 
Something to do with growing things?
It wasn't an accountant was it?
No no no.
It was something to do with growing things.
That sort of came over quite strongly.
Oh no that was his second choice.
Was it?
Mm.
Are you sure?
Mm.
Oh.
No I   growing things.
Still     I don't suppose he'll be  .
No.
Kids very seldom are are they?
No they're not.
Oh Major I bet he wanted to be right from being a kid, wanted to be prime minister.
Ken's got a very retentive brain hasn't he?
Very?
A retentive memory hasn't he?
Very  
Oh extremely yeah.
Like his father.
He never forgets a thing does he?
No.
Steve doesn't.
Mm.
When you and I went up to  to look after them?
Yeah.
Mhm.
I mean he was only a  tiny wasn't he?
Oh crikey yeah.
.
You couldn't fool him, we used to play hide and seek and you couldn't fool him.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh he's a very bright little boy but
Mm.
You can't really relax with him can you?
No.
He's  switched on 
Mm.
It's a shame isn't it?
Mm and they shouldn't be  can't, rather it can't be down to lack of  contact I wouldn't have thought.
No.
In part I suppose it's due to  erm  complete contrast of lifestyle between Jill and Steve's way and our way.
Could be.
She was just like an automated  programmed doll, oh god.
Poor kids can't help it of course but 
No she's such a nice little thing  
Oh she's a nice little kid, yeah.
Pathetic really to see her wa waving like that.
I always want to cuddle her.
Press the wave switch now, plonk you know.
Aah!
Mm.
Oh well.
She may change quite a lot, on the surface anyway.
Oh she has done already hasn't she?
She's better than she was.
Oh indeed yes.
Yes.
Certainly has.
Mm.
I mean it's most unnatural for a child not to be  chatting away in the presence of grandparents isn't it?
Unless the grandparents are a couple of weirdies .
Perhaps she thinks we're two weird, no I'm weird anyway.
Could be right.
   
Could be right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not a bad evening now is it?
No.
Have you seen a weather forecast for ?
No.
very brief  this morning I think.
We were due for better weather today which we've had.
And then I think more rain tonight .
But as the girl in the  post office said erm  it's usually different here than the weather forecast which is probably is, the gulf stream
It's not too bad finding  where you want to go
Mm.
when it comes to looking for x-ray or path lab or whatever it is  but finding your way out.
Very seldom they have continuing  er continuity  of markers saying exit, you know, or this way out.
Wouldn't it, it's stupid that 
Mm.
isn't it?
You can't get out quick enough can you, usually?
Not short on the emergency exit signs, but yeah exactly.
Mm.
I mean  once you've got in.
But once you've gone down and turned left then turned right and gone ahead  
Mm.
It's like a labyrinth  you know .
I know.
Certainly if you've not been before.
Mm.
Mm.
Exactly.
I asked somebody the way out  and she offered to show me .
Mm.
Oh!
Oh yeah, cleaner, mm.
Well Carolyn, when Carolyn was working at Witham  Withamshaw 
Mm?
she said it was very lonely at night when you were walking down the corridors.
Yes I remember you saying.
Oh it would be of course, yeah.
Mm oh it would be.
It's quite a, it seems at least quite a pleasant hospital.
Quite a pleasant atmosphere.
Mm.
Mm.
I shouldn't imagine they have the problems that they do at erm Withamshaw and  
oh  no, they won't of course.
Oh no.
And do you remember the 
What?
when Carolyn was working there they had this intruder.
Well they're often having intruders,go on 
I can't remember all the details.
There was quite a to-do about it in the paper.
Mm.
I, I know Carolyn said that they  in the end
Yeah.
they refused to work on their own
Oh that's right I remember.
Yes yes.
Yeah.
because they were so way out.
There was no way
Mm.
that they could have summoned help or anything else.
Mm.
Mm.
And di didn't she have to leave ?
Pardon?
Didn't she ha well, to get from A to B  didn't she have to leave the building somewhere?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah I thought so.
Mm.
They're not too bad here but at Witham Withamshaw it'd be a   different kettle of fish altogether .
Er yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm because  do you remember when we had to go and collect her?
That night.
Yeah.
Erm  hang on.
It was very, there's some very lonely lanes there.
I remember going late at night.
Were we collecting her?
Mm.
Were we really?
Mm.
she was in the flat.
And she'd passed out in the phone box.
I remember that happening but 
And that's when we went to collect her there.
And that was Withamshaw?
That was Withamshaw yeah.
Mm.
Er sh yes they were in er where were they living?
The flat then, they weren't  they didn't have the house.
Mm.
Mm.
You said.
And she'd only just gone to the end of the road to phone  Ken was working away.
Oh yes, that's right.
Mm.
Wasn't he?
Mm.
And Nicky wanted to, it was only  a cock's stride down the road.
Andrew was in bed and she just whipped out so Nicky could say goodnight to her daddy.
Oh yes, that's right .
Mm.
Oh dear.
What a performance.
Mm.
Yes, you get so used to having a phone at home don't you?
Mm.
It's very handy.
Having to go to the end of the road, well it's daft now.
That's if you can find one working.
Not too bad here from what I've seen.
No.
No.
No but I mean in Manchester it was shocking wasn't it?
Oh well!
It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one working.
Mm.
You know I was just thinking
Were you?
Jolly good.
That well  Lil and Nev going up on the mini break
W tomorrow is it they go?
Yeah Wednesday to Saturday, yes.
Mm go on.
I'll bet they hear of these mini breaks through the wh I can't remember 
She probably 
her name.
Was it Carol?
No it's not Carol.
No.
No it's
I don't know what her name is but  I know the one you mean.
The travel agency girl?
Mm.
Young woman, yeah.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Probably.
Mm.
Mm.
I'm wondering what  made them change their mind  over the er knock through into the garage.
Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much.
I mean the place they've got there, it er  it would mean 
Oh I'm not sugge 
that them decorating 
I know.
the whole lot again wouldn't it?
Mm.
Oh no way.
Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that  I mean even with the mortgage 
Well that's probably why they've decided against it.
No.
Before  they got to the stage of asking for quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and stuff  to clear it.
Had they actu actu really had a quote?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Mm.
They were due to get one.
Any time.
They might have had one and found out what  it was going to cost and were decided against .
Possibly.
They're having a mini break instead.
Oh possibly  again i it's just possible actually that  the construction of the bungalow didn't lend itself properly well to  knocking through.
Well I think  oh well it's so beautiful I mean as it is in there, they don't need anything doing to, I mean 
Well 
they've got it nice.
They've got it  so they don't get s sort of minimum  you know?
Labour.
Yes.
So I shouldn't imagine that erm  I mean once we've got through this one I'm blowed if I'm going to do it 
 
just for the sake of doing it.
It'll have to really need it before we start again .
Well mm.
Oh yeah I know.
But they, they are a little bit inclined to what shall we spend some money on next, aren't they?
Mm.
Mm.
Well if it's there fair do.
Oh!
Fair do, I know but er  it's up to them what they do with their money I know but  mm.
What's happened to the rest of the paper Larry?
There's only half of it there.
Well which paper ?
The Telegraph.
Last week's Telegraph.
There's only one 
I haven't the faintest idea.
sheet there.
Just one 
One sheet?
Well one  section.
Oh.
I don't know .
I haven't the faintest idea.
It's just disappeared.
I haven't moved it at all.
Not knowingly anyway.
No.
It's possible I've used it but I don't erm  don't recall.
Never had an occasion to use, well the only time I've used a newspaper as far as I know  this afternoon when I emptied the bag.
And that was
Because we were going to phone up
Yeah I know.
the piece at  with the 
Yes.
housing in.
Yes for the er
We were going to phone up and that seems to have 
the two bungalows yeah.
Mm.
It is incidentally .
It's where I thought it was.
Is it?
On the left hand side  and erm  it's  pretty near the main road.
Mm.
Oh I know where you mean.
Oh you do?
I think I do anyway.
The area .
Mm.
I thought it was on the main road?
It is on the main road.
Oh I see what you mean, the front's pretty near the main road?
Would that bother them do you think, being so close to the main 
I don't know Nina.
I haven't the faintest idea.
Cos it looks quite a decent  reasonable bungalow.
I wonder how much they want for it?
I d I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the traffic was  moving fairly quickly for the lights there you know.
But 
Mm.
I bet the layout's something similar to that one we saw  further .
Probably.
There's not much of a difference between
No, it looks the same shape somehow doesn't it?
No.
Mm, yeah yeah.
fairly tight.
But that, they're, the one that
Sorry, go on.
we went to er look at, four of them, in the middle of er the three.
Oh yeah.
Where Whereabouts was that?
There was four  four it was in the middle.
The girl that works at the garage,sh next door to that.
Oh not a bungalow, a house you mean?
Sorry, yeah.
A house.
Well that one, I mean everybody said oh  that's too near to the main road so if that was too near to the main road so will this one be.
Well did Carolyn say that?
I can't remember.
No Dawn said.
Neither can I.
Well Dawn thought it was.
I certainly thought it was.
But then 
I know.
I didn't.
I don't like traffic noise.
It w yes it, I'd, it wouldn't have bothered me that.
Mm.
Mm.
But it, I can quite see that it would bother some people.
Mm.
Mm.
But it's not as if it's a main road like
Oh crikey, no.
in Manchester is it ?
Oh no.
No.
There you could complain but I, I wouldn't say you get that much traffic at night.
Mm.
Mm.
Certainly not at night you won't get a lot, no.
Erm
Well you wouldn't notice during the day.
You don't notice the same.
It's when everywhere's quiet.
And you're trying to sleep.
Yes but it's noises you don't notice, if they're continuous then they become
That's right.
True.
Yeah.
Mm.
Still 
I mean that's one of the beauties here wasn't it?
It's so peaceful, so quiet.
Mm.
There's no noises to get used to really.
Mm.
Apart from the birds and the bees and the
Yeah.
sycamore trees.
And Sambo  .
And Sambo flying around yeah .
No he just crawled under the door  sort of glare,glare at me and then scootled, shooted past, you know.
Why?
Shot I should say.
Shooted past .
Shooted past.
He shooted past as well as shot past.
Mm.
I wonder why?
I don't know because he he's never really been frightfully keen on me, that cat.
Maybe it's probably has a rough working idea it's you that put the fountain on today.
I doubt that very  much indeed.
Get on .
No.
No.
No I try  to him but you know but er 
He's lovely.
He's alright.
He let me sort of tickle him and god knows what but er  he's pretty wary for some reason.
It may well be of course that father  was a bit er  all dog and no cat sort of person, you know?
I dunno.
Mm.
The they're both, they're all in lovely condition aren't they?
Beautifully cared for.
Oh yes.
No argument about that, yes.
Good nick
Mm.
and well fed and 
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Now we've decided not to do that little built up wall affair at the front
Hang on.
Oh there, yes.
Yeah.
it erm  we won't need to be bothered quite so much about getting paving stones.
Or stones, suitable stones to build will we?
Well we won't be needing so many that's for sure, no.
I want some for the   erection   at the side of the pool there.
What?
Oh there.
To take the waterfall.
Mm.
It's only gotta match the existing er 
Well how many do you want?
I mean don't you want to put it on bricks?
Not bricks as such, no.
just 
Cut some of the paving stones
I see.
to roughly brick size
Mm.
and use that.
As I have done with that erm
Well how many will you need?
collection  Pardon?
You won't need that many for there.
Not no no no no no.
Not an awful lot, no.
I can pad out with sto with er brick where it doesn't show.
It'd look a bit odd with bricks though, I think.
Mm.
True.
Oh yeah.
And then we want matching slabs really don't we?
Yes.
That'd be nice actu to have erm something you could sit on there.
Mm.
Wonder what do they do with old gravestones when they've er
Ooh I hate to think.
when they've abandoned the graveyard.
Well they seem to be there for  er you know when they did all that erm  levelling at erm   Southam Southam cemetery?
Yeah.
I wonder what they did with them then?
They just flattened it didn't they and and .
It's a bit much when you come 
Yes, they made it so it could be 
to think of somebody paying a fortune for a 
Yes.
gravestone and then they come along and flatten it.
Oh there must have been some sort of arrangement, I don't know.
To, to cope with that though.
Well quite a few of them  
Well bear in mind a lot of them were very old ones and there are
Mm.
probably no nearest and dearest left surviving.
Mm.
Mm.
True.
I seem to remember   papers  about that.
Erm  that removal or disposal or alteration of the  any creation around the grave was erm  can be done at the discretion of, of the
Mm.
parks authority or whatever it is, yeah.
It was better really when they'd done it 
Parks and cemeteries, yeah.
wasn't it?
It was much neater.
Oh yes.
Both in  far more pleasant to the eye
Oh yes.
far neater and er  oh yeah.
They can get more bodies in too  .
Ooh!


Shall we change the subject?
No I  ha!
No I just had a thought because there must be stacks of old grave gravestones around.
Some of the marble they  cracking   cracking bit of, yeah I know.
No they  yes they are.
Should be for the price they charge too.
Ridiculous  forking out a fortune.
I wonder how many  I wonder how many people have now got them as hearths?
Now this marble er this kind of marble hearths.
Yes you've got, yeah.
Yeah that's a point.
That's a point.
I don't like that thing we've got there.
I think they're rather thicker than that, the damaged gravestone.
Mm.
When you think of all the .
Go on.
Mind you it it's  indestructible really isn't it?
Oh
Once you've got it down.
I wouldn't say indestructible, but I know what you mean, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah very very longlasting, yeah.
Depends on the quality of the marble too doesn't it?
Yeah.
Obviously.
No I was gonna say, when you think of all the money that's spent  with these very elaborate  er headstones  erm creations showing  angels looking down on them, plonking at their harps and god knows what.
They look quite nice from one point of view  but er  fifty seventy eighty hundred years later  what the hell does it matter?
You know?
Mhm well I suppose it does to some people.
We've got to decide what to do at our fireplace yet haven't we?
Ooh  what a problem.
Well if we get some  headstones it'll be different .
If  you know if you, pardon?
If you take
Cor.
the top off, the wooden part
Er yes.
The mantelpiece?
Yes.
Yeah.
Do you think it'll  it's sort of cut so that the er it fits on top of the brickwork?
That one is I'm pretty sure, yes.
Yeah.
Do you think it'll look  still look cock-eyed, the brickwork?
Yes.
Mm.
Mind you it won't matter if we erm   will it?
Oh no that will  .
Fancy building, I mean that must have been done when, when the house was built.
No.
No no, it's not original that.
No.
the original one then?
You can see where the original fire surround was.
Oh.
Look at the plaster work there behind it, above it.
Mm.
And where's the hearth  different hearth isn't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yes, that's right.
Mm.
I'll be glad when that's done.
It's going to be a big job really.
Mm.
No I should imagine it's a typical sixties, late sixties erm  well early sixties  er tile surround, you know?
Mm.
It's not 
When you look there's, there's  really there's only this room
Go on.
to remove the paper.
Erm
Er the the the two rooms, like the big room  and the bathroom
And our bedroom.
Oh there's not much to move in 
There's in there, no.
in the be because I think 
Not, no.
the paper that's in the  wardrobe alcoves?
Yes.
Well if that's firm it'll erm be washing over there won't it?
Lick over.
Oh yes.
Yes it's good enough there.
Well there's only the little bit on the breast of the er  the chimney breast type of thing 
There's between the two  yeah yeah.
that needs removing.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
And that was, that came off quite easily on the other wall.
Yeah.
. Mm.
There's not that much to do so this is the main one really.
And the bathroom  .
Mm.
For wallpaper removal?
Oh yes.
I need to see how those steamers work, how well they work.
Well, they must work fairly well because erm
Mm.
well Joan and Clive were saying they did them.
Yes and Derek  remember, next door?
Mm.
And Terry , he said .
He hadn't used one before, and he was a bit cackhanded.
Mm.
So they must have been pretty good .
Mm.
Mm.
Nice just to 
Carolyn was saying that a friend of theirs down the road  she  hired one
Mm.
and finish  she didn't know where to stop .
And she it was so quick.
Yes it was very efficient.
You mean it was working so quick and easy?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And erm  she was very impressed.
Oh.
Do you remember the old days when it was standard practice to put one  paper on top of another?
Ooh!
How many pa 
With the overlap.
I know.
How many papers did we move 
You know?
off the er
Oh god I don't know.
the old .
Oh about seven.
Oh dear .
Yes.
Yes it probably was.
Yeah.
Mm.
What a job.
It was a heck of a long way up there as well wasn't it?
Yeah.
But do you remember the borders?
The edges I should say at the, at the roll?
Mm.
Yes.
I do.
They used to have little marks to line the paper up when you hang it.
Oh?
Yeah.
Down the 
Can't remember that.
Exactly.
Down the edge
Mm?
the name of the manufacturer and possibly the  say the model like the  that particular paper's  erm category  name.
But it had  at about oh eighteen inch intervals, something like that?
Little marks, sometimes an arrow  sticking out.
When you, when you put the next roll on you married up the arrow.
Oh.
Yeah.
Mm.
I remember cutting out when you used to have to cut all down your rolls of wallpaper.
That's right.
And do you remember  when you had to cut all your borders out ?
Yeah but don't you remember when they had that erm  erm  semi-perforated edge on it?
And you knocked it on the edge of a table?
Oh yes.
Mm.
Things have changed a bit.
Yes.
I don't quite know why they put that edge on in the first place.
No.
Unless it was, in those days, they didn't have the shrink wrap stuff did they?
I think they used to overlap them one edge didn't they?
Oh didn't th I was just thinking yeah.
That's right.
Oh it was standard to, yeah a standard practice job that, yeah.
To overlap.
Well you could always see the join.
Oh yes of course.
And the joins they've put on this wallpaper here they stand out 
Oh god .
about a mile don't they?
Well this particular paper, you  you've got to be very care 
I don't like it.
otherwise it crushes  very easily.
Mm.
I don't like it.
Mm.
No.
It's not my favourite  by any means.
We'll have to go and be having a look at  at erm
What?
choose a paper for the room where we're doing now.
Yes, there's a bit more plastering to be done yet.
Not a lot though is there?
Not a lot, no.
I want to skim that corner, ceiling and the top of the wall.
Erm
And strip all the little  
and  there's also there's a  usual crack between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a little crack running down to the door.
Is there?
yeah.
It's worth doing.
Oh yes.
Mm.
And do it properly.
Well  
Mm.
Oh yes.
And there's all the burning off and  mm.
And also I want to, while the  carpet's up, investigate the run of the cable.
So it's 
And have you any idea yet?
About?
Where the cable runs?
Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's a spur coming off  that runs into the er  But I don't think it's a proper imme immersion heater circuit.
You're joking?
Well it doesn't have to be.
Should it be?
Oh.
No it doesn't have to be.
No no no.
No.
No.
There's a  a mark on the wall, you know where the switch is  where you switch the pump on and off?
Er  yes.
Well there's a mark on the wall.
Something's been on the wall that was round.
Yes.
That would be erm  the junction box.
Mm.
Why would they need another junction box there then?
Cos there's one down at the bottom.
To feed I s would suspect the immersion heater.
Mm.
Oh.
Mm.
Well what have they taken it off for then?
Oh they wouldn't need, they wouldn't  mm.
Because y you, when you have your cable up to the junction, hang on up to your junction box
Yeah.
and from the junction box to the actual immersion heater itself
Yeah.
you have erm  a heatproof cable called er  systaflex I think it's called.
Mm.
Yeah.
Er  it's sort of a white, braided stuff that goes over.
Mm.
Heat resistant.
Mm.
So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the 
Well you know how they've  you know where the pipe comes out of the  cupboard?
Hang on.
There are a lot of pipes.
No, the the pipe that I w I think  supposedly leads to the radiator.
Erm
And it comes down under that little
do you mean the one with the pump in?
Yes.
Oh that pipe.
Yeah, yeah.
By the wall, and it 
Oh.
comes into that little erm  ooh the sort of semi  skirting board thing.
Erm
That stands away from the wall.
offhand I can't say yes I do but 
Well it it's flat and then it comes down.
You've got your skirting board
Flat and then it comes down .
It houses  pipes.
And it's 
Oh you you mean in the room?
Yeah.
Yes but I mean which pipe you mean, no.
Well I don't know the pipe.
I haven't seen the pipe have I?
Oh it's in the  oh sorry, go on.
Carry on.
No.
This thing  but er er the pipe comes from the  cupboard.
You can see it 
If there's a pipe or pipes  cupboard yeah.
I dunno but it  you can see it coming through
Mm.
and it  into that housing
Yeah.
Yeah.
and then it comes right round to the radiator
Yes I know, yeah.
and goes right to that wall doesn't it?
Yes.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well why would it need  if that, if  it does that, when it gets to the radiator
Oh it's not just for the radiator.
Oh.
I see  
It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen.
Oh I see.
That's right, yeah.
As well.
Well what I was looking at this afternoon  was your radiator  comes through the floor.
And yet all these pipes are here.
Why isn't  why  wouldn't they take erm  your radiator pipe  the water, the pipe that feeds the radiator?
Mm.
Mm.
Why wouldn't it come through  that little housing?
Instead of coming under the floor?
Well again that's not original is it?
The central heating  system is er  a later addition to the house isn't it?
Oh.
And those pipes were where the  circs where the, the  where the pipe run to the hot water tap in the kitchen.
And to the bathroom.
Oh.
Mm.
And quite probably the cold water supply to the bathroom too.
Mm.
Mm.
And I think  not the kitchen, that's on the rising main.
Cos your stop tap is  underneath the er
Mm.
sink top there.
. But that one there is er   fed, I'm pretty sure  from  the, yes it is.
Yeah because the pipe goes up there.
Mm.
Oh yes of course.
It goes right through to the bathroom doesn't it?
That's it.
And, if you think about it, there's a header tank  in the loft.
Yes.
the cold water from somewhere.
Mm.
So it'll come from there  across the ceiling
Mm.
across the ceiling  up through the erm  cupboard
Yeah.
into the l into the loft and .
Mm.
Mm.
So  you'll have the hot water pipe  to supply the hot tap
Mm.
taps.
And the cold water feeds by the er header tank in the loft.
Mm.
Well why wouldn't they take them underneath the floor?
They could of, couldn't they, up there?
Yes they certainly could.
But at the time of building I think it was  just continued practice from the victorian days to run it round on the top.
Mm.
Pretty sure.
There has been, or appears to have been, a hole in the wall that's been plastered up rather badly but  above that housing, that cover
Mm?
on the  bathroom wall
Mm.
the wall separating the bathroom from the spare room 
Yeah.
from the back bedroom  in the bottom there's been a hole about the size of a pipe
Was there?
about three quarter pipe, yeah.
Mm.
Or fifteen mil twenty two millimetres yeah.
Mm.
I think I'll wash up and then have a cup of tea.
What a good 
What time is it?
time we had a  wash up and a cup of tea I think.
It's  two and a half minutes to six o'clock.
Or eighteen hundred.
Oh the news.
Let's see if the queen's dead.
Pardon?
Where's the new oh is that the news?
Yeah.
See if the queen's dead.
Oh yes I noticed  yeah.
Well  
The only thing I  only I don't know all the names of some of the people.
Oh I wouldn't know any of them.
But  apart from that it's not a very difficult one.
Mm.
Let's have a look what's what.
Is it based on the contents of  of rather the erm 
Yes.
It is.
people on the box?
It is.
Oh crikey,I w definitely wouldn't know .
Pardon?
I definitely wouldn't know, no.
Oh you would.
up my nose it's erm  quite erm 
I know.
I went in there and I thought something was burning.
Don't let me forget there's a cake in the oven will you?
Not a bun but a cake.
Right.
You know what I'm like.
I forgot it completely last week.
Well what time  do I remind you?
Remind me at half past  half past if I don't remember myself.
Half past six?
Yes.
Yeah.
Well it's quarter past six now.
I know what it is now but 
Mm.
I'm quite capable of forgetting in about five minutes.
Mm.
Well it wouldn't take me that long  .
Oh dear.
Quite a bit more  today anyway.
Oh well yes.
Mm.
It's a hard slog  isn't it ?
I wish we'd got a bit further really but it's hard work.
There's a lot of work.
But we, we're getting there slowly.
Mm.
Let's have a look and see what's what.
you see the doors are different, quarter inch difference in size.
You wouldn't, I wouldn't have thought that.
the same.
No it didn't surprise me cos they usually  no, they put the casing up, the door casing.
Yeah.
And then the chippie erm  cuts the door to fit.
it, you know?
Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you
Mm.
just  it in.
Fortunately it is the right way round.
Mm.
I don't think they, I would have thought that everything was more or less
Well it is more or less.
spot on 
No.
No.
size.
When the houses were built at the same time and 
They possibly are today.
Erm  a lot of stuff's factory er
Is that the sort of job that er Ken would be doing?
On the building site, yeah.
Oh.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Did you hear Josie was saying about er
What?
?
He's busy on this building project now but he doesn't know after.
Oh she said a few days ago about  some bungalow or something he's  he's helping to build.
He, he's a brickie isn't he?
Yes that's right.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Whereabouts?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Oh.
Not the faintest.
So it  they, he'll be worried if  oh mind you er  anything in the building trade is a bit iffy isn't it?
I can't see Ken 
yeah.
getting a a job really, can you?
Certainly not now.
I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely difficult down here to find a job.
Because I don't  
Of any sort.
Never mind just in the building trade.
Yes, I don't think he'll rush down .
But he's so used to being .
Well he's got all his mates .
And he er I don't think he's got the confidence to .
No.
I don't.
No.
And then again he's getting older, I mean  
Mm.
it's more difficult as you get older .
See I did see there's that place erm  erm  oh it's going, it's   Tearscross direction.
Erm 
Erm 
they advert 
?
Well, they advertise in the paper every week.
Advertise  carpenters and joiners.
But  
The thing is er where he is now
Mhm.
er when, mind you he's been in his job for a while now.
Mm.
Mm.
But I mean  when the jobs have finished  he's always 
Well he 
managed to get on to another one pretty well straight away.
See hang on no no no.
The job's been never finished  never will be finished  with the corporation on it.
It's amazing .
Specially there .
No but I mean, I don't mean wh I don't mean where he's been working for the corporation, I mean  before when he's had these various jobs and they've finished and he's had, you know, the job's finished and they've had to go somewhere.
Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
He's always been  quick at picking another job up  
Oh to be fair to him, yes he has.
He's been very quick at that.
But as you get older that's not so easy is it?
No, precisely.
No.
No.
And he might not find it so easy here.
Cos there's so many more people in pretty much the same trade.
I would have thought so.
Yes.
I would have thought so.
Mm.
And it just isn't commonsense to commute 
No.
to Manchester is it?
Oh he'd never do it.
It's ridiculous.
Mind you, the only thing that I was thinking of, do you know when he was commuting 
Ah.
that firm he was working for
Yeah, can't
to Sw was it Swansea?
It probably was Swansea area.
I think it was, yeah.
Yes it was Swansea area.
Go on.
He seemed to like that, although he did get fed up with it .
Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina.
That was motorway nearly all the way.
Mm.
And he could do it in  less time.
Mm.
It was a straight run.
There was no driving involved.
You just point the car in the right direction  press the  pedal and you're there .
It was still a long way.
It's a longish way but erm  for Ken it's not quite the same as erm  the A roads and B roads and 
No.
oh no.
No.
Cos he doesn't really like driving.
No he doesn't.
No.
And it is a bit of a tedious journey.
He'd never do Mike's job.
Well  he'd never do Mike's job anyway but 
Oh no.
you know, the driving side .
No but Mike enjoys it doesn't he?
Mm.
He covers a a rattling  big area.
He's got a big area to cover, Mike  if you think about it.
He seems to enjoy the job doesn't he?
Seems to yes.
Mark you he wouldn't crack on if he didn't.
No he wouldn't say very much about .
Well  no I don't suppose so.
No.
No.
But goi reading between the lines, you can usually have a a rough working idea  
Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at er at that erm what do they call themselves?
Oh I can't remember now.
Erm oh well you see 
Mm.
Oh a hi fi firm.
he doesn't l like being tied to the bench does he?
Oh no.
He'd sooner be out.
And I think I think he does his job well anyway.
I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
So all is well.
Mm.
It, it's a sha I feel sorry for young married couples these days.
Mm.
It's very hard going isn't it?
Oh yes.
Mm.
Oh yes.
Well 
 
Go on.
Mm.
I was gonna say something, I've forgotten.


As is my wont.
Well you usually mm.
Mm but I can't see, I don't think Carolyn would have much difficulty.
Er no I d particularly  in view of her experience
Cos  yeah
I don't think she would.
Exactly.
Quite as much anyway.
No I don't.
She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll get on, yes.
I think so.
And possibilities for Carolyn
Yes.
came now.
I don't  we may be completely wrong.
But as far as this exchange business is concerned.
Mm.
You'd never get erm  you'd never get an exchange.
No.
I don't think we operate that scheme now.
Larry have you got any books out from the library?
No.
That needs taking back?
No, no.
I was just looking at that, going right off the subject but er that Uri Geller?
I bet that's interesting?
It's er moderately interesting so far, yes.
Yes.
I wouldn't mind reading that.
No I thought you might.
That's one, another reason I got it out from the library.
Erm it rabbits on quite a lot up to now.
Yeah.
About all the er astonishment, amazement  the English press and public and the Swedish press and the public and the American press and public, you know?
Push push push all the time.
Mm.
Erm
 

Yes well of course you can only assume that what he says is correct.
He's quoting various  er authorities on the subject .
I've only just started the damn thing really.
How did he er y how did he first find out that he w he had this   
Well he that's why he wanders on a bit.
Erm keeps giving little bits  erm  It was when he was a child apparently, he claims to have been aware of it, you know?
Mm.
A ch as a child?
Mm.
How young?
How old?
Oh that I don't know.
Oh it doesn't give any particular age?
Mm.
He admits to wanting to be a showman, you know?
Mm.
A film star and god knows what.
Oh well  .
Loads of children do that don't they?
Mm.
It doesn't mean to say it always comes off.
Mm.
Mm.
Well let's see what I've got to do here.
I've nearly finished this one but .
Mm.
Let's have a look.
What's number one?
You certainly shoot through the first few ch chapters of that anyway.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Lot of repetition.
In effect.
What's an ongoing topic?
Politics .
In five.
Is this based on  TV then or?
Well you  pretty much, yeah.
Oh well .
Not erm well a lot of, lot of it is.
It's probably their own quiz game then is it?
Or  panel game or
Yeah er no I don't think that is.
Mm?
Oh.
I can't think of any  TV quizzes or panel games or 
Well that er that's not.
You don't think it is?
I don't think so, no.
And you haven't got any of the letters?
No.
I'm afraid not .
Oh.
eleven across.
Oh, this Arthur played Alf Garnett's pal.
Oh, I wouldn't know.
Oh English, I do know.
Oddly enough.
English?
Oh that's it.
Arthur English.
That's it.
Because I've got some in, oh 
Oh yes, yes.
oh aren't you clever.
Well not really, no.
It's just that I happened to  .
I know.
Erm I've got G and I in so that's Arthur English, of course, of course .
Mm.
I could not think.
Good grief.
and all that jazz.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh we might have a  a flash of  .
Oh.
Oh.
Who was the author of The Darling Buds of May?
I don't suppose you know that.
H E Bates.
Was it?
I think so.
Bates.
That's right I've got A T in.
Oh I've nearly finished it.
Steer away from bloody television and we might still have a fighting chance.
Yeah .
Mm.
Mm.
I don't suppose Al you know Albert Square's yuppie  
No.
No.
I haven't the faintest idea.
I think that's something to do with Eastenders.
Albert Square.
Oh I'm certain it is.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm  five down, what's that?
Oh that's that ongoing topic.
It's, oh no I've got two in.
Something something E something E. 
Still think something, probably it's  about something   but probably tied in with the er  erm
nineteen across.
Art programme .
It's A something E something something
Hang on.
The first letter is A?
Yes.
Oh it's not the South Bank Show then.
Erm  A something E something?
A something E something something.


Mm.
Depends how desperate the need is.
Have you finished with this ?
Yes thank you.
They'll think we're always blooming eating .


puddings.
Oh dear.
Well let's face it  Mm.
The broom.
The broom, yes  
Erm 
different coloured broom.
Oh for the back?
Yes.
Yes.
I think erm  we'll have to have a trip to  St Ishmal's for that.
Probably.
Where else could we go?
Erm well we do 
Other than that er rather expensive
Well what I, I do like about St Ishmal's is the way it's laid out and  
It's laid out but the plants look healthy and they're kept in healthy conditions.
They do.
Yeah.
Mhm.
To me that  Dingle place
I wasn't very struck on that.
I wasn't at all struck, no.
No I wasn't.
There were all weeds growing among the plants they're selling.
Messy.
Yes, messy.
And it wasn't just the messiness, I don't mind that, but
No.
They weren't looked after.
cos you  it was difficult to find  the things that you w you want  oh I don't know, it was just
Mm.
it didn't erm didn't appeal to me somehow.
No.
But erm I remember when we got the original broom that we've got in the garden now, the golden one
Yeah.
Where did we get that?
We got that at St Ishmal's.
Did we?
Mm.
And erm  they're sort of labelled, you know what, it gives you this picture of what you're buying as well.
Oh yes.
With most of the plants it does, yeah.
Yes cos I want to get the particular one I want
Mm.
Mm.
to go next to the 
Well obviously, yeah.
you know, for the effect and erm 
For the for the contrast, yeah.
Mm.
I want to know the height
Mhm.
it's going to grow  
Mm.
Mm.
I think it's er  I think it'll look nice there.
It should look quite attractive.
Yeah.
It might be a bit of a job erm  keeping them separate.
growing into one another.
But I don't think so.
No?
Oh no.
Oh.
Well, it doesn't really matter.
Oh that's alright then.
Good.
Because I mean they don't sort of grow out, they grow up don't they?
Yeah, but they do grow out a bit too.
I mean the one at twenty seven 
Yes I know but not enough  it wouldn't really matter if  that, a little bit of it .
No no.
No no no no.
cos that's the idea.
Mm I suppose so, yeah.
Mm.
Did you see, you know this last gardener's   
Gardener's World?
I haven't really looked at it, no.
I glanced very briefly at it but
Where it had er a broom garden?
No I didn't see that.
Oh let's have a look and see if I can find it.
And I thought
Some er excellent photography there you know.
I know.
Mark you, most of 
There's a primula 
There's a what?
I think that's what they call a cowslip now .
I've no idea.
  

Saturday or Sunday?
Saturday.
You know where I've put  you know down the bottom end of the garden,th that little bit of digging?
To shape the ga er where the grass is?
Right up in front of the sweetpeas?
Erm  the left or the right?
Right down at the bottom there by the apple tree.
Do you mean where the daffs are going?
Mm.
Yes.
Oh yes.
yes but  on the side.
Oh there you mean, not at the bottom, at the side.
Where I've just dug.
Mm.
Where I've just dug there.
And I said I'd put sweetpeas?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah?
I was wondering whether to  put some  fuchsia.
Because I've got some fu  
Haven't we got some  towards this end?
Perhaps  
Yes we've got got s I've got loads in, in flowerpot, in these big containers.
And I 
Oh I see.
I'm just stumped where to put them.
Mm.
I don't want to keep them in containers.
If it's an evergreen, no it's not is it?
Fuchsia?
Mm.
No.
No.
Mm.
No, they die down  
Mm.
Mm.
Most of the ones that we brought seem to have erm
Survived.
Survived.
Which I'm glad.
Mm.
Mm.
Because we've got some nice ones.
And then those that Karen brought us, they were nice.
Yes.
Yeah.
Got some lovely ones.
Mhm.
Well I thought they'd be  protected by the fence.
Yeah.
Mm.
Wouldn't have much room for sweetpeas though would I?
I don't know though, they'd grow up behind wouldn't they?
Yes.
Course they will, yeah.
Mm.
The only problem being cutting the hedge.
Pardon?
The only problem being cutting the hedge.
Cutting the hedge?
Mm.
Oh yeah.
But
But how often do you have to cut that sort of hedge then?
Not a lot.
Not like a privet .
Mm.
if I can find  erm  I can't  I remember Carolyn bringing that, you know that little er the  anemone?
No?
And we didn't know what it was.
Er all I can remember  a lot of plants coming.
Yes well
But I can't remember 
I remember that  in a little pot  down there and  you know they were labelled?
She put the labels on.
Oh yes she did, a label mhm.
Well I'm sure I remember the anemone  blander 
Mm.
I don't know.
Oh I see  
And I think I planted it 
Yeah.
and it nothing s , it didn't seem to survive.
Mhm.
And I was reading about the conditions.
Maybe with erm  erm putting fertiliser on them  you know
Mhm.
Mm.
erm 
Mhm.
I think it  and it's come up 
Ah!


Well, good o.
It looks quite pretty now but it could be quite .
Well .
Yeah, true.
Mm.
I've come across a bit of architrave by the way.
Quite apart from 
Yeah.
.
Erm  .
So I can use that as an experimental piece.
Where?
, there's stuff  come to think of it it's the one in the hall.
The doorway that's bricked up.
Yeah.
Oh of course.
I keep forgetting there was a doorway there  when we arrived .
Yeah.
That's right.
the architrave from there.
Yeah.
Erm  it's exactly the same varnish stain as this.
Is it?
So I can muck about on that piece before I  tackle it in here, so  mm.
stripping goes.
Oh I see what you mean.
To to er see 
Without staining, without  what?
Mm that's true.
To see if w what colour we can get that we like instead of this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
Mm.
First of all  what's the best stripping medium.
Whether it's gonna be gentle heat, whether it's gonna be  varnish stripper?
Paint stripper?
What the hell.
And then see the  go on.
Er w do you have to strip it?
If we want to change the colour.
Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as such.
But it's very, and it looks a bit crummy, that stuff I always think.
Ooh  .
Ooh well I don't know,
Mm.
See look at 
It's a big area.
Pardon?
It's a big area to strip.
Why, wouldn't it
Well it's only what  erm the architrave  the arch there  this side, that side and that one there.
Well I mean if you had it sort of darker, wouldn't it stain darker slightly?
Well as I say you can't stain varnished wood Nina.
Oh.
You can put a varnish stain on.
Varnish stain  but erm  In  in this particular light now I can see  where they've put on thick blodges that run down.
I know, it's terrible isn't it?
Mm.
I wouldn't think that was a professional job.
Oh what was?
I don't think .
But  well originally what would they have done with it?
When it was built?
Oh no I don't think, I don't think it's from square one.
It probably would be varnished from square one but that's not the original varnish.
No.
Shouldn't think, no.
I doubt it very much indeed.
shocking colour  isn't it?
Yes it is.
And do you know the old bog door, it's the same colour as next door's.
Or was I should say.
Was it?
The same yucky blue, yeah .
Was it?
Mm.
So  if you look at the  next time you're in the loo
Mm.
where the handle was, look where the blue  shows.
And that's that was the original colour.
That w do you think that's what they did originally?
Yeah.
The original colour, yeah.
Mm  when it was built?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
blue didn't they?
It might of course have been a more acceptable blue when it was put on because it changes 
Do you remember that er flat that Lil and Nev er went into?
Oh goodness.
Before they
Oh down here ?
No.
Where?
They've not been in a flat  
Oh  Prestwych 
Yeah.
Yes.
Well when, yes where they rented when they sold theirs 
Yeah, yeah.
and were waiting for their other house up here to be finished.
Paid a fortune for the damn .
Yeah.
Well   that was all blue, do you remember ?
No.
I only remember one 
Because when I  when I went to see Lil
Yeah.
er spent the day with her
Yeah yeah.
and I hadn't seen the flat before, and the first thing she said to me  wherever you look in here it's blue.
And it was too.
Was it really?
Yes.
Er it  
Well how do you mean?
The paintwork was blue?
Everything, yes.
Paint, decorations, everything.
What ?
Well n 


not every not every exactly everything but
Mm.
as you got, went into the flat you got an overall  picture of blue.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Everywhere you looked was blue.
 
I find blue a depressing colour even though I like blue.
I mean I 
Well it's  isn't it?
Blue for depression and red for excitement and
Yes but
What's a calming colour?
For a decoration in a home I don't like blue.
No, no.
And yet young Nicky's gone for blue.
Blue  
Well it's a change from black that .
Well yes they've got the black furniture you know 
They've got the furniture  of course, yes.
That's true.
Mm.
Mm.
Some of it looks nice, but  I wouldn't like 
Well it'll  die the death eventually won't it?
I mean the stripped pine  really horrible.
Mm.
Isn't it?
Yes, well I think  I think it's overdone.
Course it's overdone.
I like a bit but
It's blooming cheap half of it.
It is cheap.
Er no it isn't cheap .
cheap.
God no.
I wouldn't say that.
Cheaper than 
It's a bit glaring to me.
I find it so, it's not as mellow as I like.
No, it's not.
. It's usually crummy wood.
Badly assembled.
Well it  depends how much you're going to pay for your furniture  doesn't it really?
Well I mean the one that er  that er thing, what is it?
They paid a lot for that didn't they?
It's it's rubbish, that thing.
Is it?
It's rubbish.
Absolute rubbish.
It really is cos 
Mm.
I'm not struck on  
they moved it out when we went on one occasion cos  was the carpet wet or something?
I don't know.
They moved it out for something  reason so  I had occasion to look at it more closely.
Oh.
I thought, I was looking at it before, I thought mm.
Anyway  it drew my attention to it and I thought god god.
Mm  it might be fashionable but phoo  Incidentally I wasn't far out with th the age of our friend across the road was I?
No.
No.
Twenty four.
I thought he was about that.
Mm.
Bit like Eric's place in a way  .
Oh never!
Wonder how he is.
Mm well no.
Not in that se pardon?
I wonder how he is 
Eric?
I don't know I wonder.
and whether he's still going.
Oh probably, yeah.
Probably .
Floating with his beer every afternoon, yeah.
He's a funny old stick wasn't he?
Yeah.
Wonder whether he got anywhere with the ?
Seemed to make a beeline for his place didn't they?
Mm.
Most probably he got  waffling on  in the Royal Oak and that.
Mm.
Gave the impression  I think.
Mm.
I can't see our friend er what was his name?
The chap that bought our house?
Oh  god
The probation officer anyway  
.
.
Mm.
Erm  I can't see him  him getting very  chummy with Eric can you?
No.
No.
Nor Eric getting chummy with  
No.
Well he'd try, initially.
He did try.
I know.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
He's a soft touch for everybody else.


Mm.
Mm.
He always meant very well though, Eric, in a lot of ways.
He couldn't help being a simple soul could he?
Simple soul..
No.
No.
Mm.
He used to swear blind he saw his mother standing at the end of the bed.
He  Eric did?
Yeah.
He'd seen his mother sat at the end of the bed  ages after she was dead, you know.
Oh  
Oh yeah.


Yeah.
He was quite genuine.
He wasn't mm.
Mm I think that was when his had auntie died, he'd seen his mother.
When his auntie died?
Mm.
Oh that's going back a bit isn't it?
I know yes.
Oh yes.
He didn't see  his auntie as well then?
No I don't think so.
I don't know I'm sure but he never mentioned it anyway.
I don't remem erm his  I don't remember his mother.
Only
I've got a very hazy, but I could be confusing it  her with one of the other relatives  
I think  she was ill when
Was she short, dumpy  podgy sort of thing and?
Well no, I don't know.
I don't remember .
Oh I, neither do I.
What did?
Auntie 
Oh auntie was only small, similar to to Eric.
Well about the same size as nan really.
Yeah.
So it could have been his auntie, his mother  I don't know.
I wonder if John and  John and er mm
Liz.
Liz have moved yet.
Well we thought they had last time we went.
Do you remember?
Oh yes, I vaguely remember that but I, whether they'd actually moved or not I don't know.
Mm.
I wonder what had happened to the stool.
Which stool ?
Th do you remember  er who was going to, oh I don't   it was the store that Robin made.
Oh the tall stool Robin made?
Yes yes.
Yes.
And Rob and  John and Liz were  hanging on to it   somebody was going to pick it up weren't they?
actually.
I've forgotten .
I don't know!
It was a state of chaos then though wasn't it?
Well  I wouldn't like to move, we are not moving again  .
Oh god no.
No way.
Never again.
Well if we do we'll wait another sixty years anyway.


Mm.
Oh what an upheaval.
Mm.
I don't know how people can  move from one place to another.
Do the place up then
Well
move over to another place.
Oh heck, no thank you.
it depends on a lot of factors really doesn't it?
Mm 
Or a lot of factors come into it.
Age group  finances 
 
desire to move  for a variety of reasons, erm     permanently regarded  house in the first place, you know?
Mm I mean like in Jill's case, Jill and Steve
Yes, that always struck me as a bit odd, yes.
I it's a big upheaval every few years isn't it
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
to have to do it with your job?
Yeah.
Mm.
And it's worse when you've got children to cope with as well.
That and the obvious school problem too with the kids, yeah.
Mm.
I don't think it's good for them moving them about from school to school do you?
No it can't be.
Well I don't know about that, I mean with some schools it'd be a good idea to get them away from it.
Well 
And some areas, in fact.
I mean   really desirable to move away from there wasn't it?
Er well that's true.
Mm.
And privately it would be no bad thing to move away from where they are now.
I mean, well they're gonna have problems wherever they go, but  the  on erm  a different estate  different type of estate, they wouldn't have as many problems would they?
Mm I don't know so much.
I don't think so.
Not as many.
I've found out how to get rid of the cat scratching.
No  another idea?
What is it this time?
No, it's not my idea.
Apparently you can get 
No, no?
pellets of  er lion dung  
Oh I, yes .
Don't you remember erm
Oh dear .
somebody on Gardener's Question Time answering that?
I didn't know you could get it in pellets.
Well either did I but 


Yes  
Although although inoffensive to people, cats dislike  the scent and avoid 
For obvious reasons, yeah .
Mm.
We'll try that.
Yes.
Materials cause no ill effects to plants  soil or your own pets.
Mm.
How much er   ?
It doesn't say.
lions obviously, well.
Oh hang on, yes it does.
The lion dung 
 
pellets come in a handy sealed plastic bag inside a box with instruction.
 
One kilogram contents are enough for about  thr thirty metres  square 
Good god!
square metres,I know,and will last for roughly three months  in average weather .
Oh gee whiz.
Be a bit potent.
Mm.
Price per bag is eight pound  oh it's eight   eight pound ninety nine 
 
Mm.
Mm.


Open container with care.
And stand back .
No it would, it wouldn't necessarily pong.
No it says it  it it's inoffensive to people.
Mm mm mm.
You can take it two ways, it'll probably get up and bite you  .
I'm still looking for me broom .
Was it broom?
Yes I think 
Oh yes, yes.
I'm sure it was in here somewhere.
The name of that particular species is in there though.
What do you want?
Er
The colour or something?
Can't remember what it said underneath it.
Well er won't it be in the other one, catalogue.
Yeah, I think it was in this one.
I seem to remember looking at it in the other one.
I forgot we sent for erm 
Oh yes, your free giftie.
free gifts.
Mm.
Oh yes.
It'll arrive no doubt.
ago since we sent it.
Oh it's not long is it?
Not for that sort of er thing, no.
They're certainly not quick.
And they probably haven't    if they get five hundred   certain number and five hundred thousand  you know?
Mm.
It's not worth looking on the box for the news because it's, they'll be nothing new.
I can't find it.
Mm.
Mm no doubt you will eventually.
These rolled houses are they 
these?
Rolled, what they call a rolled house.
What on earth is a rolled house?
It's a kind of a, a type of mini greenhouse.
greenhouses and frames er  the prices!
Oh no no.
It takes your breath away.
A tiny little thing of the size of a tomato house.
Yeah.
Fifty  pounds.
Well it's a bit like these victorian wheelbarrows and things aren't they?
Yeah solid .
How much were they?
About seventy five quid or something stupid like that.
They're  not as good as the .
Lot of weight in themself.
Bound to go rotten eventually.
Mm.
Well they're trendy so  I suppose it's the usual afternoon run to  Leo's is it?
Pardon?
Usual afternoon run to Leo's?
Oh yes.
Yeah I suppose we want   Mm.
Am I not supposed to be going somewhere tomorrow to  to enquire about something or ?
Oh I know what I meant to ask you.
When we go erm 
Ah.
no er we haven't said anything about it before I only
Oh.
thought about it when I was reading the property thing  it might be er while I'm in Leo's 
Oh yes.
The estate agents?
Mm.
.
Yes I think their office is near the erm near Iceland.
Think that's it.
And there's two houses here  oh i it might be an idea, although I wouldn't mind going in and having a look.
Yeah.
You can have a look.
But usually by the time I come out of Leo's  I'm dying to get home .
Yeah.
W well let's get off er early, soon as we can.
We always do though.
Don't we?
Mm.
What time is it?
Oh I know what I need.
I want to go in Boots, anyway.
Oh yeah.
So I don't  so where is ?
Well I'm not t is the address there?
.
I think it's on High Street.
Mm I can't see it.
They don't sh give the address?
Oh good god.
Oh here we are.
Er 
Oh.
yes,.
Ah.
Yes by the number I er it is, I'm pretty sure where I thought.
Mm.
Going in to, or rather going up High Street in to High Street from the erm Freemans Way, you know?
It's  this side of  Iceland on the right.
Mm.
Oh it's near Iceland?
Yeah.
 

Yeah.
Oh er it didn't register.


Well there's these two here.
There could be some more.
And it'll soften the blow  .
There's no  there's no price on there I presume?
No that's just the thing.
Ooh!
It's a stupid habit, not putting the price on.
People must lose sales for that.
Well it's possibly at the request of the vendor you know.
I know they do.
But what I'm saying is people
Oh yeah I know.
a lot of people, if they're, alright  if you want it, you're interested, and you're interested you'll find out.
Fair do's 
Course you will.
but  not everybody will bother like that.
Oh no no no.
You do tend to skip by if there's another one that you think oh well 
Course you will.
Mm.
I I I'm
Oh I won't bother with that cos that'll be too expensive, or whatever, yeah.
Oh quite, mm.
Er yeah I think  
Mm.
Mm.
Or possibly  
I don't see the point because you can pick up the phone and find out if you want anyway so
Yeah.
Yeah.
it's just silly.
Where are those two ?
Are those 
 Johnston 
Oh, St Peter's Road one is it?
Er it doesn't say.
I don't think so.
Er the St Peter's Road one only had two bedrooms didn't it?
Yeah.
Both these have got three .
Are you sure that isn't  I think they were agents as well for one round the corner.
In  Cromwell Mm.
Well  oh, this one l this  there's one that does look like the one on  St Peter's Road.
Mm.
But it's er   three bedrooms.
Well I'm sure they the one you s 
Can I have a look?
There look.
Okay.
Erm 
Yeah.
I'm sure the oth the St Peter's Road one only had two bedrooms.
No, that's not the er  unless it's another handling agent cos that's not the photograph
Well they won't change the bedrooms will they?
One's got three and one's got two.
Can't be the same.
No of , no.Oh I don't know.
I don't know.
.
Unless it's a misprint.
Well  misconstruction about the use of a room more likely but  where's me other windows?
Can't see with these damn things.
Most attractive detached bungalow  blah blah blah blah blah  Come to think of it I don't think it is that one.
I don't think that's the one on St Peters.
You don't?
No.
It's a similar
Mm.
shape and  Did it have two chimneys?
Yeah.
It did.
Well we'll get a few  and then
It's, it's not in this week then, that one?
No it doesn't seem to be.
At least I, I didn't see it.
Mm.
I might of missed it.
Yeah that's possible.
Ouch!
This other one in  Johnston will be fairly pricey I think.
Erm I have the 
This white one.
feeling it could be.
Mm.
Eighteen foot lounge job.
Well it's, isn't it lounge  stroke dining room?
Fitted kitchen, dining room.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
You know that little row  of cottages   by The Windsor?
Erm
Near The Windsor.
I can't visualize them to be honest, no.
No.
Oh.
Oh,one or two of them were they?
I can remember one quite clearly that absolutely  dog rotten window frames.
That was at this end one that er Josie was talking about today.
Cottage?
Well not cottage erm er terrace.
Oh.
Mm  vaguely.
Mm.
Is that the one that's going up er  but the auction .
Thirteen was it, she said?
Or sixteen?
I'm sure it was thirteen actually, yeah.
It may have been, it may have been sixteen.
Mm.
She said it was nice.
Mm.
It can't be much for sixteen.
No you wouldn't think so .
Coo not today.
No.
It may be of course it's on, on auction because they can't get a mortgage on it.
It may be too bad for a mortgage.


It could be.
Mm.
You know when we were looking originally?
Down here you mean?
No  before we came to be looking down here.
Oh.
Ah.
When we were er
North Wales?
looking in North Wales,and round there.
Yes.
Oh yeah.
Yes I do.
Yes.
Er  why people were buying cos the house boom was on then wasn't it?
You couldn't  
Oh buying unseen you mean?
shocking isn't it?
Buying without seeing?
Oh!
I know.
You can't fathom people would be so crazy.
I couldn't.
You just have to be a fool.
That people could buy a property unseen, well you know, it's ridiculous.
And the price  
I wonder how many w It's a pig in a poke.
I mean just when you think about it they  they were actually following estate agents when they went out to value a property.
I know.
Gee, god.
But now I mean   what a difference.
Mm.
I find it a bit hard to believe what  said about being  the boom's coming ba not boom but  picking up.
I don't 
I'm not so sure Larry.
I don't know.
Well, look Carolyn's had three  to look 
Well
three potential.
mm very .
Mm.
Actually one's, there's only one turn I think that's rotten.
If you make an appointment you should jolly well go and see it.
Or at least pick the phone up and say erm you know 
Sorry, no.
Even if.
Yeah exactly.
At least let them know you're not going.
Yes.
For one reason or another, yeah.
It's not fair.
Mm.
No no.
Erm
Never forget that girl in that bungalow we saw.
Was it the  one ?
No,.
With the
Yellow radiator?
With the yellow radiator.
That's right.
Bright yellow 
She  and dog muck all down .
Ooh!
But I couldn't help but feel sorry for her.
She was quite a young girl wasn't she?
She was a nice girl.
Oh yes.
Yes.
She was nice.
Mm.
She knew damn well we weren't interested didn't she?
Oh yeah.
She must have done.
She was sort of half apologetic 
Aah.
Mm.
Wonder whether she sold it?
I suppose she did.
I presume she must have done eventually.
Mm.
Er and a husband was a teacher er a lecturer  
Oh we saw some 
wasn't he?
I know we saw some  tripe didn't we?
And that one we saw .
You walked in the front door and you  quickly walked out the back door .
Oh strewth.
Yeah.
Well exactly, yeah.
No thank you.
Mm.
Still.
 

I suppose we might have had one or two lucky escapes there didn't we?
We did!
By not buying up there.
Well not really.
We just wouldn't have even entertained it.
Well I certainly wouldn't, but I know somebody else was getting a bit fed up but 
Ooh.
Well, how many did we look at?
Quite a few.
Mm.
We certainly travelled around didn't we?
Yes we did.
Mm.
Yeah when I think that's  mm.
We clocked some miles up.
And actually some of the  areas on the outskirts of Prestatyn were quite nice.
Before you got actually into the town.
No, but erm 
Not bad.
Not bad, no.
not  nothing to compare with this.
Not  compared with down here I don't think.
No.
It still had a north of England feel about it you know.
Didn't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
It was a big improvement on Manchester, fair enough, but er  mm.
I can accept, of course 
When you come to think of some of the houses though in  in  Wiggenshaw where Carolyn is now
Yeah, yeah.
there's some  really nice houses .
Oh the properties themselves.
oh yes, indeed, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
The comical thing is  one of the comical things is  there's quite a lot of money go into some of those corporation houses you know?
Oh I know.
Well look at Carolyn and Kenneth.
Since 
I know.
they've bought theirs they've made it beautiful.
It really is nice inside.
Yeah what about the income going into the house?
Yes but I mean when families grow up and  children start going to work  and as Carolyn was saying
Mm.
theirs, while the family were at home
Mm.
Mm.
was a bit cramped.
Yeah.
But when they  now they're all  
Mm.
they don't want a big place.
No they don't need a big place.
No.
Ooh  with all the space heating, carpeting, decorating.
You wonder where they 
furnishing 
they put everything don't you at first when you go up there   all the family there.
Well.
Storing this and that and oh no.
Mm.
Mm.


Mm.
It's jumping about I know but I wish we could hear from Robin.
It'd be nice wouldn't it?
Yeah photograph or something 
Er well it'll soon be Liz's birthday.
Erm I'll tell you, talking about birthdays
Mm.
I must get a card, it's Ken's birthday soon.
Twenty fifth  
Hang on.
Which Ken?
Big Ken?
Big Ken.
Oh well li 
Not little Ken.
His bir 
Oh yes yes  
birthday's near christmas isn't it?
Er when is his birthday?
Twenty fifth of .
Is it really?
Oh.
And how old will he be?
Erm  forty s 
Poor old codger.
Forty six .
Is he as old as that?
Good grief.
Yeah he'll be moaning.
He does not like growing old.
Do we er any of us ?
Well I don't think anybody does.
I mean   
Oh well  good.
You can't do much about it can you?
Remember Percy across the road?
Not wanting anybody to know he's seventy four,
It's usually women that don't want you to know.
Well exactly.
I was quite surprised.
For a farmer too, ex farmer I should say, yeah.
Mm.
By god he's got some stuff 
I
Ooh.
Erm  I tell you what tickled me when, years and years ago when Alec was alive, remember old Alec?
Oh I  can't forget Alec .
Go on.
I went into the stores and 
Yeah.
and there he was boasting about  his age and
Oh yeah,Mm.
Did he?
but he was getting on.
Mm.
I mean er  he looked every bit, he looked a lot older .
Yeah   he looked older than he w he looked older than he was, yeah .
Oh dear, I thought
Never guess how old I am.

Oh well .


He was a sitting target for Mike though wasn't he?
Oh I think he enjoyed it.
Oh strewth!


Mm.
I wonder er I  do wonder whether erm
G er go on.
Mi Mrs  's still there.
It's a shame.
She probably is.
Mm.
Erm 
Well she'd not had much of a life had she?
Not in her later years, certainly not, no.
Well she wasn't very well when she started 
?
Well David was only small.
Was he?
Mm.
Oh I thought he was at school, you know, bigger boy at school.
No erm sh when she first started erm 
Mm.
Dave was only little.
A toddler I think.
Oh!
Really?
Mm.
Oh well, mm.
Well .
He was pre-school.
Mm.
Mm.
Maybe not just a toddler but he was pre-school.
Mm.
And it's funny  isn't it how  erm a child is motivated mentally.
I mean he  he said he would be a doctor when
Oh yes.
Yeah.
to make his mummy better.
Yeah.
Years ago when she first started.
Mm.
And see he finished up being just that.
Well th that was  incidental.
Er things got that he could make his mother,the other way round.
Well he said 
 
when I grow up mummy I'll
Mm.
I'm going to be a doctor and I'll make you better.
Mm.
Aah I thought that was lovely.
Y yes.
Yeah.

damn paint and stuff, cor strewth.
Ooh.
I'm sick of burning paint.
I don't know about you .
Oh I'm doing it outside tomorrow definitely.
Mm.
Oh  weather permitting.
It's one of my pet hates, burning paint.
Burning paint, plaster and cement.
Ooh!


And Artex.
And I don't know in which order .
There's a lot there's a lot more paint left to burn.
Good grief.
Mm.
It's a worthwhile job though, isn't it?
Oh well y we need to do it and there's one job 
Mm.
Unfortunately it's 
I'm not looking forward to is doing down the stairs.
See that back door, had it been  applied well, the paint I would have just rubbed it down.
Mm.
If it had been like our  door, the existing door  it would have stood rubbing down  flatting down and er then .
Well   you can use our existing door then .
No, bloody likely, oh no.
too much to repair it.
Yes, it's a thought that.
I wonder.
Wonder what?
Well  where it's been hacked about
Yeah.
I'll see if those handles will fill that hacking about.
They might.
Well what about the  edge?
Well that I would have to fill of course, obviously but
I know but
that's not too ba oh no no no 
Well what's the point?
Pardon?
Well what's the point?
It's a bad door isn't it?
Mm the rest of the door isn't too bad is it?
Okay.
Hm.
Mm.
I'll have a look tomorrow.
No the leading edge I can fill in alright.
To save the 
What with?
Variety of things.
Finish off with timber.
I could erm  and   save the lock er well the  yeah the lock.
Mm.
Mm.
It might.
I doubt it.
I dunno.
I'm just thinking of all the hacking about.
It seems rather extensive to me.
It may have gone too far, they may have bashed away too much.
I think they have.
We'll see.
And what will you do with the other side?
Which other side?
The the, where it fits in.
Hang on.
No how do you mean the other side?
The the door jamb itself.
Oh well I've got to do something with that anyway.
Haven't I?
Will you have to replace it?
N no, no no.
Cut the bad stuff out and er put the new timber in and shape it  to fit the existing door casing, architrave and
Well won't it show?
It won't scream anyway.
I mean short of replacing the whole door casing which I'm not going to do  yeah.
Mm.
Oh what a mess everywhere isn't it?
Yes .
Hm.
I'd forgotten Josie saying it was er you know it was a  wardrobe.
Made the wardrobe, ha!
To be honest I thought it was this other bloke who .
No according to Josie it was .
Cos erm I think she or  was it Yvonne said to me perhaps I'll find me  hillbilly  lend me er  yeah  
Or perhaps .
Something like that anyway .
All the rough, rough sods in  oh strewth.
Ooh.
Terrible.
I mean when you get splinters out of it
Yes.
that's going a bit too far isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Mm.
Mm.
And that's when you're being careful .
I mean fancy putting your clothes next to a thing like that.
 
Anything delicate.
Mm.
Incidentally what er arrangements er  if any, have Mike and  have Mike and Dawn made for this er summer?
How do you mean?
Well wasn't Dawn saying about they're going to go to France this year or something?
Oh

Mm.
Still I'm a patient sort  he says.

Mm.

Look it up in  Titmarsh's book.
Mm.
About the flowering.

Seriously.
Seriously.
So what made you want to move down here?
Well we've wanted to move for twenty five years possibly.
But you know how it is, it's family ties and kids growing up and  then they grow up and have families of their own, then you get tied to the ch grandchildren or what have you.
I've been pushing for a long time but erm  down here?
Well  I have a brother-in-law living in  Stainton He's lived there, he retired there some what, ooh fifteen years ago, more than that.

Cup of tea, turn the car round and go back.
I couldn't stand the bloke at the time.

I, we can
Er ooh
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

Oh I see, yes.
 
At all?
Yeah it's 
Mm.
Well th there's two of us going round
Mm.
but er we've got different ideas on how, like  like I myself

And they're a little bit over, yeah.
now like, like  now like this one hasn't got a ticket you know it's 
At all.
Mm.

Oh that's very  
what I do, I give an hour.
Do you really?
Oh I turn away and  you know if he's paid
Er yes, yes.

Er  and of course that's fair enough
Mm.
but er if they come back and say look I was gone to get change.
Fair enough as long as they come back and they put a ticket on.
Mm.
Mm.
But er  when I'm gone it's too late.
Oh indeed, yes, yes of course.
But if er if they come back and they're tidy enough
Mm.
you know .
It must be quite a boring job though?
It is.
Yeah yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Well not really we've got one, and we've got a big multi- storey car park.
Oh I know the multi-storey, yes.
You know?
That that takes ages to walk round and of course 
Yes.
and then we go to the top.
Yes, yes.
High Street bank.
Oh do you really?
Do you really?
We go there.
We go to .
Oh I see.
Oh well  yeah.
We go to the station.
We've got loads to go round, you know?
Ah.
Oh no I assumed it was just here and .
Oh no no no no no no.
We go round  
I see, yeah.
I mean I'm, I'm here now and I'll go away and then the other bloke may come round later again.
You know?just go round 
I see, yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
in circles.
In circles.
Yes.
But erm
Yeah.
then we go back to the office then for an hour and people of course will come in then and say why are you booking me  but 
Oh yeah yeah.
But er  if they  they come back to their car and they're tidy enough.
Mm.
Mm.
As long as they don't start
That's reasonable.
Yeah, oh well
swearing and
Yes.
Yes, quite, yeah.
Well we're told to just, just walk away.
It's not worth arguing.
No.
You know?
Oh no no no.
It's er  if they come back and they say I'm sorry I'd gone 
Mm.
gone to get change like that fellow there now, he was worried  that I'd book him over there.
Oh!
Because  
You know, and I I, and of course He came back and he  and he bought a ticket.
You know, so
Mm.
th that's fair enough.
You know?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
But er
Mm.
this one now has got no ticket on, so
Ah yeah.
If he'd of come back while I'm here, well 
And give a reasonable explanation or be pleasant about it and  
Well y y Well that's right, yes.
. You know?
You know?
Yeah.
Right.
Mm.
But you you you go up to some of them and there's ooh this and that.
I think you'd get more than a t parking ticket looking at it for M O T wise if he get pulled.
Oh yeah ah well it's   cost them ten pound now see?
Yes, exactly.
Yes.
Ha!
twenty P.
Yes .
Yes exactly.
Right.
 

Can I borrow your writing device?
Lovely, thank you.
Twenty one twenty three please.
Right, thank you.
and it needs holding up.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
And it was all in a bunch, so I've had to sort of unhook it.
Oh I see what you mean, yes.
Yeah yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
I think though  this afternoon .
Big success, yeah.
I'll empty the pockets and then
Be decisions decisions.
Decisions.
Oh..
Have you done with your plate ?
Mm.
Right.
We're eating again .
Er yes.
Well it's the only time we get  chance to talk at the moment isn't it?
I know  yes .
Mm.
And then with Lil and Nev away.
Well that's true, yes.
Yeah.
You could get twenty four hours continuously with Neville couldn't you?
Oh well I'll say .
God strewth.
lovely isn't he?
yourself.
Have you seen this?it's nice.
What , what is this?
No.
. Ooh.
Bring your thing with you.
Bring me thing with me.
Easily carry that.
Perhaps it could be next door, could it?
No I don't think so.
You've not left anything upstairs have you?
No no.
It smells like burning .
Mattresses or  blankets, the carpets  
Well it's not here.
We've not got anything burning.
No.
I've not had a blow lamp going this morning at all.
It's probably come in with the door being open.
It may even be the school you know?
Oh of course.
Burning some rubbish in the er
It could be, yes.
in the incinerator thing they've got there.
Cor it really pongs doesn't it?
Mm it does.
Mm.
Many different types of smoke  and pong.
Wood smoke, when you're camping is
Oh it's nice isn't it?
it's, exactly.
Yeah yeah.
Remember when we used to take the pressure cooker when  we went out ?
Oh yes.
Yeah, well it was worthwhile wasn't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Neck of lamb.
Mm.
Mm.
And everybody else was eating sandwiches.
That's really org yeah.
Jolly good.
Nice.
Mm.
I never use that now do I?
No.
But I wouldn't get rid of it, because just in case.
It's erm
We went camping again?
Well that's not very likely!
I don't think so  
No thank you.
No but you never know.
I do.
I'm not gonna go .
I don't mean camping I mean
Oh I see.
Yes.
You know?
It might come in handy.
No I know what you mean.
Yeah.
I made jam in it.
Yes I have a hazy recollection of that.
It was quite nice really.
So that was 
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah.
it cut the cooking time down.
Mm.
Mm.
It was quite easy.
Mm.
Seems an awful long time ago in some ways, you know, camping.
Well it is!
Yet other ways it doesn't Nina.
Mm.
The erm  difference in cer some things can seem a long time ago and some are  relatively recent.
Mm.
Yes I wonder what
It doesn't really seem all that long since our lads in shorts, you know?
It doesn't.
. For  god's sake Larry .
And there they are thirty nine .
No no seriously
Best look forward, not back.
Oh I know.
Yeah.
It's a pity that this house 
Oh.
is erm
Which ones did you heave, by the way?
Oh, only the ones I knew she wouldn't have.
Er economy seven.
Oh my god, yeah.
Erm terrace 
Well hang on, no.
You didn't put a definite no on economy seven did you?
Well they were terraces.
Oh well fair enough.
No I'm talking about economy seven in case you heave 
Well I think that 
any more 
Yes she did.
Mm.
She wants gas cooking.
She prefers er  far prefers gas cooking I know, but
You, I think you'll find she won't  even contemplate cooking by electricity.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
I doubt that very much.
What's this one?
This looks, they look like Barratts.
It's an end  terrace.
This one.
Mhm.
It looks very small.
It's an end terrace.
She wouldn't rule out an end terrace but 
Ah is that the one  the  Barratt type place?
Well I  yes.
Yeah well
Well that looks like a Barratt type as well doesn't it?
Yes.
Exactly, yes.
It's the same estate isn't it?
It is yeah.
The same address, same area.
Yes, it is.
Yeah.
But there's quite a difference in price if you notice.
Forty two for this.
And thirty something for that.
Thirty seven I think it was, something like that.
Could be wrong.
Yes it is but I think this is the one  erm this is 
This is  this is, this is
Erm  wait a minute.
Mhm.
I don't like either, to be honest with you, but there we are.
Oh I don't dislike them but it's not one that 
Well if you weigh that other one up  the end one.
.
This, which?
This one?
Yeah.
There wouldn't be room for the caravan to start with.
I thought there would.
No I don't think so, no.
Yeah.
I think you'd find there would.
No.
I don't think there would be.
That's  well it looks like it to me.
Mm.
Mm.
Full stop.
That'd be it.
Just let's read what it says.
Mm.
No room for a garage.
No  parking a car is there?
From what I can see of it.
Mm.
style entrance door which opens 
Oh yeah.
to the entrance hall.
It's erm  important to remember by the way
What?
Well some estates, not many of course, but some estates have got  a no go area for caravans parked don't they?
Mm.
I don't think we're likely to meet it here to be honest with you but yes you do get it.
Ah well there's a caravan parked round the corner.
Well I'm just saying  I just said that  we're not likely to get it here.
No.
But erm  it would be a damn sight safer down here wouldn't it?
It wouldn't get vandalized, broken into  scratched, bashed or whatever.
Grounds, here we are.
Tell me, the
Lawn, just a mo.
Mm.
Go on.
Property stands within established principally lawned garden  
Yeah I read it.
Yeah.
shrubs, trees
Mm.
Mm.
Privacy from the roadway which is what she would like.
Depends what you mean by privacy of course, but go on.
Privacy or privacy as they seem to say these days, don't they, sometimes?
Well I say privacy.
I don't know  .
carry on saying it whether it's right or wrong.
Same with  controversy and controversy.
Controversy.
I know, I still .
It's a real controversy though.
Yeah I 
Controversy.
God, you've got me at it.


You see?
Yeah.
How easily you can change.
Good gracious me.
Did you notice this morning on the box, the er weather girl?
No I didn't.
She uses controversy and er
Did she?
Our friend  what's his name, Mike is it?
Yes  
Yes.
He did the  accidental I'm sure, controversy.
Oh.
Mm.
And she  
It's it's easier to say for some reason or other and yet 
Well it is for us because we've always been saying it.
But I don't see any reason why it should be easier.
Mm.
Controversy, controversy.
It's just accent on the 
Mm.
Mm.
Fed up with  plaster up me nose and
I'm fed up with this stage altogether.
Oh strewth, yeah.
I'll be glad when we get it cleaned and we can start the actual 
There's quite a lot of it to do yet.
decorating bit.
Well we're   it's  it's the er  first principles, prepare your surfaces isn't it?
Which we're doing.
Oh I know that.
No.
But that's the  mm.
Well we've finished the burning off  in there.
Yeah so that's one pong gone.
Very largely gone .
It still lingers on a bit though.
Oh yes.
There's not an awful lot more filling to do, but there is a bit of course.
Erm  not plaster there's no more plastering is there?
I sincerely hope not.
No there's no more plastering.
No.
No.
Just filling now.
Imperfections you know?
Joints and , stuff like that.
And that , it's a pity about that  but  I'm leaving the damn thing  
Oh, yes 
Fancy putting boss white?
You know what they say?
Never trouble trouble.
Oh I know.
If it works leave it alone, but
I'll say .
erm  on balance it's best left on and to just
Well it is really
Yes.
if we can get away with it.
Oh yes.
I'd far sooner take it off and do a proper job but  well 
It er well it's easier isn't it, really?
But on the 
Well 
other hand, you might have problems with it leaking if you take it off anyway, so
Well that's a p yes exactly, yes.
Cos  
No, if you've got to 
and I've got to scrape out all that horrible boss white.
Cos it goes rock hard that stuff, over the years you know?
Mm.
Boss white.
I wonder whether it was leaking in, when they  put it in in the first place?
Do you mean that's why they used boss white?
Possibly.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well let's not erm ask for trouble because there's  more than enough to do without having  .
Oh quite, yes.
Mm.
Have you noticed that by and large, not all the time of course but  I should say that eighty percent of the time birds face that way?
No I've never noticed which cos I'm 
Mm.
Cos see that pigeon is now.
Oh yeah.
In the tree, yeah.
Mm.
By far the majority of the time.
It looks like a picture doesn't it sometimes?
With those trees.
Oh god, yes.
Yes.
I've never seen so many perch in one tree.
Mm.
Facing basically west, aren't they?
Mm.
That's true.
Mm.
Look at that pigeon 
pardon?
sat there.
Yes.
Yeah.
The windows are filthy outside .
Mm.
You don't often get one pigeon though do you?
There's usually at least two of them.
Well you usually have two together don't you?
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
Ooh that door!
Yes that was getting on my wick that door, yeah.
Shut up door!
Mm.
I was bunged up before I started this.
bunged up now.
I wonder who  I wonder who chopped and vandalized all those daffodils round the corner??
Well  and the fact that it was just their garden, and as far as I can make out it was simply that garden, it would suggest that she's fallen out with some kids or  something like that or somebody and  yeah.
Mm.
I mean why pick on one garden and systematically 
Well they probably thing, yes but cabbages?
Fancy taking cabbages!
I don't think they'd been actually taken from what I can gather.
Well what did they do to them?
Oh just cut them?
They slashed them about, yes.
Cut them all.
Mm.
Peculiar thing to do.
Oh according to Josie, I really don't know about all the cabbages, it might consist of one or two.
Funny business, yeah.
Oh it's a shame though isn't it?
Mm.
Mm.
All the time you spend waiting for the blooming things to grow .
That's Yvonne's mother isn't it?
Yeah.
That's right.
Didn't Yvonne say she can be an awkward old devil?
Oh I don't know.
Mm.
So I sh 
 
yes.
She's probably fallen out with some kid or other.
You can't be sure of that.
Oh no no no no no.
If there'd been a trail of destruction down the road, then fair enough, but
I couldn't er  go and vandalize something, I mean a thing like flowers.
Mm.
Mm.
They're so nice that
Well we think so.
Obviously there's others that don't think so, but  not everybody thinks so.
Well a lot of people like, I mean most people like flowers don't they?
Yes.
Whether you grow them or not's a difference  but most people 
Yeah, yeah.
Oh true, true.
They're not an ug ugly thing.
like them.
Mm.
And I couldn't go and vandalize something that was nice.
No.
No.
There's some peculiar minds some people have don't they?
Oh yeah it's very small beer really isn't it?
Compared to some of the dodges they get up to.
It is really.
Mm.
Have you decided whereabouts you're going to put that light at the front?
Light?
Er well no the, well at the front.
Other than that, over the door area somewhere, I don't know exactly.
I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around with it for a bit  and see where it's best.
Mm.
But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway.
Mm.
of course is cable running to it  providing it with power.
I'll probably run it from the garage .
Mm.
About the easiest source.
On the corner I think would be perhaps a good idea, do you think?
Between the garage and the house.
Do you mean the return?
If you come from the front of the house going towards the garage, that little bit there?
There's two feet or something .
No.
I thought you were going to put it facing the front.
I am, yes.
Well what do you mean then, the corner?
On the co on the front of the house at the corner.
Yes , you mean literally on the corner?
The apex of two
Yes.
Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go right on the corner but 
Well I know that.
Well wherever you put it you're going to have to make something to mount it on.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Why?
It'll screw drive  on to a flat surface.
Brickwork.
 
Yeah.
Certainly it will.
Yeah.
Mm.
How high up are you thinking of putting it?
Above a vandal .
How high  .
How high is the one we've got at the back?
Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it.
Er up a step ladder I mean, not a 
I think about, above the number.
I'd thought roughly speaking in that area, yes but
Er yes, well somewhere there.
Ah well that would illuminate the er  see if I put it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side, going down towards the garage.
Close to that corner, still lighting on the front face but
Mm.
then a percentage of light will go round the corner.
Well  cos lights don't go round corners but 
What about on the garage above what about on the garage?
No.
No?
No that would throw the front door into shadow wouldn't it?
Mm.
Mm.
Well above the number then.
Cos you're nearly, you know, more or less on the corner there anyway aren't you?
Mm like I say that would be  mm.
Oh that way I can then get a decent cable run I think to the garage.
For feed, you know?
Mm.
Mm.
Well that's the easiest bit,.
To the  circuit, yeah.
What's that then?
That is .
It will be helpful though, having a light there.
Oh yes.
Because at night, you get a percentage a a 
Yes you do.
degree of light I should say from that  street lighting, but not an awful lot.
Not the same, no.
Mm.
No it is handy having the light.
And for people coming in, going out for the step.
Yeah.
whatever, you know?
Mm.
 

It'll be a quite sufficient  spread to, to cope with the er  entrance to the garage I mean, you know?
Mm.
I still think two rows of erm pavers  stones inbetween's the best bet for the front you know?
To put there.
There's only one problem 
You mean to the garage?
Well the approach to the garage, yeah.
The drive.
Like Mike's got at, in their  
Er yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
Yeah.
The usual thing, yeah.
Well you get a erm
You get a what?
You get a lot of weeds where the chippings are.
No, not if you put sodium chlorate down.
Nothing'll grow then.
Good grief.
The thing is if you 
If you what?
erm  I'm just thinking if, like when anybody comes to stay 
Yeah.
Yeah.
and you run the car, or somebody runs the car  the other way
Up the sides, yeah.
Yeah?
Well then you're going across, you're not staying st er you're not on the pavers are you?
No, well that doesn't really matter.
I mean the erm  in fact, there's only one fairly tight  path you can follow to get the car in.
Into the side.
If you think about it.
Mm.
It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just to cope with the track of the pa er the wheels going in.
Oh wouldn't that look a bit odd?
Not necessarily, no.
No.
I don't mean put down like bloody tramlines .
What, like I have down the garden there?
A railway line in.
No no.
Actually it's quite attractive 
A walk you know walk 
that actually.
Well it is but it  
I was looking at it again this morning.
Yeah.
I thought that.
Ooh  hark at her!
Yes.
Well I think some of the bricks could  when you decide wha which you're going to use and which you, mm.
Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er
I'll  get some of those bricks up and put the stone things down cos they look better.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.
As long as I can get, walk along and get to all the plants there.
What do you think of that ?
I'd definitely think about moving those other pavers at the bottom.
There we were the steps are.
Oh lifting them you mean?you mean?
Oh god .
Yeah .
That would make th give it a better erm 
Yes.
Yeah.
I don't see any reason for that, to be quite honest, why they've done that?
Well there was at the time obviously.
Cos do you remember there was that erm  monstrous  creation I should say erection,erection  for erm 
Oh I know that.
Well there's still some of those stones at, underneath that .
The foundation, exactly.
I know, yeah.
We've got to move those before we grow anything.
I've put some of the bricks over one side, so that'll eliminate getting rid of one side of them.
No, I'm not with you.
Well where I've put me bricks  they're 
Yes.
on top of some of those  stones that are underneath.
I'm with you now.
It's fairly deep  eight inches down, the bricks?
I know.
I know I went quite a way down.
You did.
I mean honestly you'd have thought they were building a ruddy house there wouldn't you?
I wonder what they did it for?
That's only er I don't know.
It's the same with the  greenhouse 
It was a right monstrosity that thing wasn't it?
They'd have had a nine inch  thick
erm  solid concrete  path in the centre.
Who the hell 
I know!
wants that?
In the middle of the co 
Stupid.
er of the greenhouse.
Talking about stones, we'll have to have a trip up to the erm
that er  yard to see if .
You know when we went to see about the flagstones?
Oh there?
Yes, yes.
I've not seen any  there's not been any more in erm  workmen in .
It's a good idea that, going up there.
Well   oh dear.
I've kept  my eyes open  when we're going through  Harford 
No sign?
and there's no signs of work.
Mark you  it wasn't a brilliant day was it?
So
No it wasn't.
Well we just have, must have just missed them.
Yeah.
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
Cos those were definitely new ones, ready for  placing in.
Mm.
A, a pile of stones.
Oh yeah.
So the old ones they'd have taken back to that yard place wouldn't they?
Well no.
No no, no.
What do they do with them?
No, straight to the tip.
Well that's the place that 
That's not the tip.
Where we went?
Yeah.
That's not the tip.
Well which was the tip?
You've never been to the tip.
I don't think, no you've not.
Oh.
It's erm   Tearscross way.
You know the quarry?
Well  the quarry area anyway, the same road.
Oh so I've never 
You can approach it two ways.
From erm 
I thought it was there.
They had a lot of stones there 
No no no.
didn't they?
That's just bits they've had on various trucks.
Lorries and things.
Oh.
No, no.
Oh I see.
No no.
The tip is where I went.
The first time I went  I followed the route recommended by Peter?
Peter  which on a map looks quicker but it isn't cos it's a winding
Mm.
country road  single track in a lot of directions.
Do they just heave the bricks?
They just heave them?
They don't 
Apparently yes.
sell them off or anything?
No.
No they don't they just  they stick them on to 
Mm.
They'd serve our purpose very well there
Mm.
Mm.
because there's such an awful lot to do.
Mm.
We could bring them right  well the two that are down there could come  
Yeah.
It would save you a lot of cementing wouldn't it?
On indeed it would, yes.
It would.
Mm.
Mm.
I'll be giving that mixer a caning this year though.
Pardon?
I hope to give the mixer a caning this year.
I hope  you do too .
Yeah .
Mm.
wondering what to do next.
Mm.
Oh yes, yes.
When you come to think of it though it's s to me it makes sense  to start at the top where we have done  and work your way down doesn't it?
In some ways it is  sensible, yes because you're carrying muck down.
Well of course you are.
Yeah.
I mean down, when we've done down here we've pu god  been putting mats down and lord knows what to
Mm.
oh yeah.
Mm.
But the erm  ceiling rose  and preferably the light switch  could do with replacing .
Oh I know the ce oh the ceiling rose, they're horrible those old things, aren't they?
Mm.
Well the, the lighting switch isn't so clever either.
No.
And before  I put too much back I want to have the floorboards up to clear
