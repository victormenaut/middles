Space Man.
Sunday night 
Come on, Grant.
It was Sunday night and Scott was watching Space Man on television.
Scott had watched him get into the rocket many times and he dreamed about going with Space Man.
It would be fun if I could get into the, that rocket too, thought Scott.
It would be fun to go far out into space.
That was the one thing 
Full stop.
Scott thought about.
He was fast asleep before Space Man had finished his trip.
Scott began to dream.
Good.
The time had come for Space Man Scott to go to the moon!
He would be the first boy to land on the moon.
Scott walked outside and looked up at the rocket.
The rocket was as tall as seven houses.
It was as tall as seven houses.
This rocket was, this  Scott said that that would take him to the moon.
Scott climbed inside the rocket.
The men were getting ready for blast off.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Blast off !
Space Man Scott be began  has
His.
his trip to the moon.
On and on into space went Scott Seven.
Then a part of the rocket fell away.
When Scott looked out, he could see the stars and many flashing lights.
Part of the time Scott talked on the rocket's radio.
Part of the time he just looked out into space.
The rocket came to a stop at Space Station.
Some works at the station 
Some workers.
some workers at the station took Scott inside.
New line.
They asked him 
 
they asked him to remember all the things he could about the trip from earth.
Then the men talked about other rocket
About the other.
about the other rocket would take him
That would take him.
on to the moon.
They helped Scott get ready.
In the morning, Scott, three other men got into the moon rocket.
Again he were ready to go.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Blast off !
Away went the rocket with Scott and his friends inside.
Away it went on its long trip to the moon.
As last
At.
it, at last they landed on the moon.
Scott and the men got out and looked around.
What a strange place it was.
Look here, look here Scott, said one men
Man.
one ma one, said one man.
Do you see that big brown thing that looks a boat?
You live on that boat.
That's the earth.
That's what your home looks like from up here on the moon.
How strange it was fro for Scott to see.
That 
His.
his home was a round planet far out in space.
One man had a shovel.
He wanted to take some things from the moon back to earth with him.
The other men looked around and talked on the radio.
Scott  followed the men.
He was not looking where he was going 
He was, he was looking .
Yeah okay, sorry, you're right  
he was not looking where he was going, where he was going
And.
and he fell  down.
Down, down, down Scott fell.
The dream was over and so was Scott's trip to the moon.
Well, said his mother, what are you doing down there on the floor?
Scott laughed I just fell off the moon.
He said what a dream I had .
Very good.
Any more homework?
Well that's excellent, darling.

Look!
A Son of a White Horse  that your book from France mummy bought you  
Daily Express today?
She loves books 
It's the same 
 
it's the same thing today.
Er
Let's have
young, gifted and demanding it says.
Her  have said and she went along, Bobby and they found her so brilliant
Is that the same one?
That's her?
Erm she 
She can use a computer
yes, that's right 
she enjoys  
and her mummy was so sweet.
The little boy looks like his mummy.
Catherine   
Tells you things she should, she should be able to read when she's three or something?
Jodie  oh that's Jodie  Bobby!
Right,have you  starting to talk early and with a wide coverage  unusual it is for their age example, classical music for a three year old, reading by the age of three, early ability and enjoyment of  
 
real curiosity about how things work 
Mm mm
not just to repeat the question why?
Logical ability, proficient in chess, good at puzzles or special toys such as Lego .
That's your favourite, Lego.
You like Lego?
She loves Lego and she especially like  
Lego?
Where's your Lego?
But to make them that Bobby, for her teeny weeny hands, how she can manu manipulate.
The, Grant's Lego, the big 
Yes 
Lego she can handle them beautifully, even Sheila 
Lost a Lego?
when Sheila was here last week and Linda, and Linda's little boy Christopher and he's only about a month younger than Annabel and erm she feels the bits would be too tiny for him.
He would eat them.
Cos one day we found him and he was choking to death practically and erm er Tam, Linda's husband turned him upside down and smacked his back, he'd eaten a one pound coin.
Blimey!
Now he could've choked and died!
Hey, you're damaging that, Annabel.
So  the last time, remember 
Don't do that to it!
remember the last time Linda was here she came on her own and her father 
Okay, okay 
dropped her and then her husband picked her up and the Reverend  
 
the Reverend Peter  came that day?
Yeah
And erm well he came to the door and Linda and the little, the little boy Christopher they were upstairs.
But previous to that Linda had said that she was terrified  to get Lego for the little boy.
She was terrified when him and Annabel was playing it.
I said she's okay and she can handle it beautifully, and she's never eaten any little parts yet and some of the arms, Bobby, are tiny!
So she thought, well she saw Annabel handle it so beautifully she thought she might get some for Christopher for his Christmas.
But obviously she hasn't got them because erm she would have said when she was here last week.
She  last week.
But  
Be a singer, sing a song 
Bobby, and it's  to move their fingers and to use their imagination with pictures.
It's good for them.
It, it is, it's so good for them!
And  for that things that erm Tupperware that Totem Pails, and you stack up the pails.
Yeah
I think they were about twelve pounds just for a, just some little things that you can use just like a little seaside pail but the totem pails, totem poles, it was totem pails

When Raymond came and did the windows last week, he said he'd booked up  I  
I've got 
the same time as we go to Cyprus and he hasn't actually booked a flight yet but he's got the villa cos Aily a few doors along, remember she's got a villa in erm
Aye,
it's near, it's near Orlando.
What?
Is it her villa he cleans her windows?
My horse!
Yes, he cleans her windows as well.
Her name's Ann
Dad!
because he mentioned and I said is that the lady that lives in America?
My horse ran away!
Mummy's speaking  
My horse ran away so I got away.
Remember last year when they went to America 
So the  again last year, were they?
Slightly younger than me erm, no, but he'd mentioned that and he said erm
if he wanted to book again that she could let her, his, her villa.
So it's free for October, the complete month of October and erm he hasn't booked a flight yet because the fares are so expensive.
Did he tell you how much they charge?
Yes.
The last time you saw Raymond, remember he said it was erm, how much further.
I think there's gonna be six this time.
There's Raymond and his wife and his wife Sherry's I think brother and his wife and little baby and then somebody else.
So there'll be six people.
So they've got to book the flight but they might book it nearer the time when hopefully they'll get a cheaper flight.
He's tried direct flights and so on but he thought four hundred pounds, four hundred and fifty was a bit much although he'll get the villa so cheaply.
Yeah.
So he goes in October  you went and er same time as us 
Quiet, Annabel 
September the thirtieth, first two weeks in October, Bobby.
First two weeks in October.
But, that's what he wants just now but if he can get the flight then it, it could end up being the second and third or the third and fourth week.
