Cos any other person who has just not applied and have a couple of points be able to take you to court.
Na.
Solicitors there's no way you can't not fight it, in the beginning you can just go guilty and he said hang on minute let me just read it through  he said no, he said you've got to go and do it.
That's July the seventeenth, he  could loose his licence .
What they charging him with?
Erm,uncare, undue care and attention, yeah.
But it's no way, I mean it was a really wet morning at quarter to seven, it had been raining, and he was right behind a lorry, and he, he, the lorry went to go one way and the  he didn't go back because he knew he was going one way and the guy was going the other, he just started to go round to go to the left and bike was just there, he had no way of seeing him or he .
Was it a catch two situation .

What  do, you have to go to police station .
Last time we were there we had to bail Darren out..
Well the Solicitors turned round and said to him that there's a twenty five per cent chance he'll lose his licence, but then he'll get there erm, but most he'll probably get is about a month, and then he said, well surely your job could find you something to do in that time,has said, no licence, no job, so what he had to do was to .
Can Solicitor .

Yeah  Right.
These are the ones.
Stick them there, just take them down.
Sealed up, whether it's hot or cold they retain the temperature.
.
You see, basically what you do, you just take them out and we put salad bar, all we do, we have one of those and one of those.
Hm, hm.
Plonk it down, take the lids off and there it is.
That's it is it?
You've salad bar's there.

Yes .
But they do, there's, cos they put a charge on orders below so much.
There we are, twenty pounds surcharge on orders below fifty.
Fifty one .
Well, we do  yeah.
Well that's basically and for the people who are just buying an odd box.
Yeah.
But I would think, I mean, ideally we need four I would think in the first instance er two of those and two of those and then the inners.
Have they got, it's the, in this company I, I've never used there equipment before, but it, it seems.
Alright.
It seems better than er the ones I have used.
There, there lids are certainly a better idea, built with better fasteners cos there's.
I know it's ages since .
No, the er, the  Reuberwerk one, the German ones, the fasteners on them are a  have plastic clips.

.
Well yes he goes,.
We go up there sometimes on a Saturday night, cos my brother and his wife .
Yeah, so erm  .

Erm,street, you, you know where that big church is, by the light of big round a about road .
.
..

How's the  ..
Lovely, yeah.
I haven't actually do  Darren has, Darren has.
What is it you've got for me?
Perspex,columns.
Oh from, which one are they from?
Where there  .
Frank Cooper's , thank you.
Oh yeah, Frank Cooper's that, C P C, freebies.
I see.
What are they for?
 Spence in sauce of course.
Oh I see.
I'm surprised they sent it by courier, he said he was going to drop them in, mind, there's another one, a big one to come, this is only a small one.
Lovely.
money in it?.
Portion pack.
Oh .
Yeah.
It's all packaging.
..
Hm.
.
This can all go straight in the bin this with all this lot.
All that for this little thing.
Yeah one .
Probably right, must be another part to that..
Nothing else in that.
No .
Hm.
Nothing else to it.
No, nothing.
So you just tumble them all in there and sort of fish about try and sort out which one it is.
.
Yes.
That's not much cop is it?
.
can't be right.
If your gonna put .
It's not like it was in the picture.
No, your gonna put those little sachets in there, there should be a bit wider in there so that you can take which one you want.
Yeah.
But, even then.
Well it was suppose, the one on the picture was in different levels.
Yeah.
No this isn't right, there's something wrong there, that's not complete.
No.
How do they come down, just in er flat box don't they?
Hm.
Yeah, well you probably can get them in there and you  in there and get the thing out again.
It's pretty badly made in it?
It is badly made.
cost more than anything else,.
Well I would of, I would of thought that , I mean if your gonna take something out that that's sort of size all well and good, but I mean it won't even dispense will it?
No.
Oh well.
I mean you you need something where it's gonna pop itself out.
It's all welded round you can't get it out .
Well that's it, it can't be right, it can't be right, because what you would expect in there, is another sort of perspex piece that comes at an angle like that.
Hm.
And you put them in, you know whatever it is, all one side.
The feed, the feed in.
And they would force themselves to the front all the time.
Yeah.
That I could understand, yeah something that was sort of that shape, even if it was only just at an angle , but it, I would of said that was much to big for it.
Hm.
Those little sachets, unless of course you've got a divider in there that takes two different types, yeah  Oh one.
Perspex column dispense.
Well, well that is .
Urgent dispatched.
Something definitely wrong here.
And there's nothing else in that box at all.
No, only the packaging.
answer.
No.
Oh well, it's for free.
Yeah, but, why have  free things is there useless.
Hm, we'll find some use for it .
Just about hold a box of tea to pull the tea bag out of it, won't it?
Hm.
But even then it's at the wrong angle, you, you mustn't, you shouldn't put your hand right inside.
Hm.
That, that  avoid that sort of thing doesn't it?
Hm, it's not terribly smooth either.
No.
And that's direct from Frank Cooper is it?
Yeah.
.
That looks .
But I would of thought there'd be an inside of a lid for that.
Well, yeah.
A lid or something to keep the muck and .
One no doubt the rep will turn up again before long.
It's certainly not on.
I've got a big one coming a wooden one, supposedly  I think of something..
It doesn't dispense  at the bottom level.
Oh.
Funny thing.
It certainly doesn't look complete.
I'm sure there should be an inside and a lid to it.
Hm, you'd of thought so.
Well, will see when he turns up.
.
.
.
Eh, certainly not given much away.
.
Probably is.
.
Well ya, the Frank Cooper's part of er C P C, Knorr, all that group of companies.

My favourite fish is Sole.
Sole, yeah.
.

No, I like the meaty fishes, but it's the, it's the price of 'em, it's just like buying steak.

Yeah, there's a company that er imports from the south seas, all the fishes and they just charge two pound a pound.
Hm.
Whatever arrives, but you just don't know what your going to get , no, it's flown in er trying to think it comes in four days a week by air, it's selling at a good price but you don't know what your going to get and I mean, you couldn't, you couldn't risk using it somewhere like this, so, it, the chances of selling it.
with all fish especially with  it's gotta be .
Hm.
Yeah, we use to do it on location.
.
Yeah.
.
You get all the er,selling different, especially, I mean if your going round with people for months.
Yeah  .
You got you've gotta give 'em some.
Bit more about it.
Yeah.
You know it just tastes the same.
Yeah.
That's it like a st stage is here, I mean it's very awkward to caterer for people down here and for the stages on the same menu.

Certainly not .
So it can't be a very big fridge because they they had one here before and I was lucky to get four cartons of orange in there and one bottle and you've had it.
And I can't  get any bigger.
Well

Do you need anything from the house?
No.
You got the bottle?
Yeah.
There's the bottle.
Why, watch with Guy.
I mean it's a case of of what time we'd make the journey isn't it?
It'll make a big difference.
I don't know you have any thoughts on that?
Well, we've got to do 
 
Mind you Br Brian's supposed to be coming back to me on er whether or not he he's gonna be around at all.
Cos he's in Paris.
But he he doesn't know what his schedule is yet.
He doesn't know whether he you know is flying over or driving over or  where he'll be when.
So I don't know.
Yeah.
Didn't take you this morning.
Take 
When I took Guy out.
Well I couldn't get er  couldn't get a paper or anything.
So the meat and the spuds should be cooked.
Lovely.
Say well we don't want to do too much do we today.
I think in next weekend  possibly er  if we drove down on the Sunday evening 
Yeah.
Sort of Guy would sleep
Yeah
and it'd be the roads should be quieter.
Shouldn't
staying over for the bank holiday monday?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean it's gonna be hell on the roads on bank holiday Monday isn't it?
And the thing is if we get up Friday morning, it's gonna give us enough time, up there.
We'll see.
We'll have to go and see Russell and Leslie on this, this time though.
I'll try and arrange it so Auntie Dorothy spends Sunday with us.
I mean haven't even got the er   on yet.
Mm.
on Tuesday to see what she was doing  that's of course if she can get .
If not, we're going to have to buy one.
Right.
Can't put you in a drawer can we?
Just trying to think whether there might be somebody up there that I know that has one.
 

We'll have to take a couple of gifts up for them .
What, Russell and Leslie?
Actually the baby might be here now.


Give your mum a kiss.
Yeah, it might be.
I knew it wouldn't be here this week you know I mean if they've told her there's another three to four weeks it's unlikely that it was gonna be  last weekend.
Yeah.
Still.
Not to worry.
No.
Wonder what he'll be.
Probably another girl.
That's what I think.


I'd lay odds on Russell wants a boy.
What a son and heir?
Yeah.
Son and heir.
Good job we had one.
Well that's it.




Isn't it funny?
I stink of garlic again.
Do you?
Oh dear.
I wonder how that happened.
you know like
Sorry.
it's very embarrassing.
Is it?
Did somebody mention it?
Yes.
Breathing fumes over patients when they're not feeling well and nauseated and then they get this  of garlic.
It's very unfair on them, I was ever so annoyed with you this morning.
Oh sorry.
This poor patient was really ill and there I was breathing garlic over her.
Ah.
Did she mention it?
She did.
Did she really.
She said what, what were you eating last night she said


as she vomited.
Don't, who's exaggerating.
I'm not exaggerating.
She was really ill this morning 


quite a nice 
Mm.
It's quite a nice area here.
I like this area I really do actually if I could afford to live here I would.
But it's so expensive.
I'll tell you something I don't want to go to  school.
No.
I really don't.
Well come on we know he won't.
He won't.
Well I've got to go  and put his name down 
Yeah.
Specially for a playgroup.


Mind you the school for this catchment any better?
 
 
I think so I mean, there  good and bad wherever you go but I never 
What about Bushey?
Bushey.
Well I wouldn't send him to  wouldn't be living there.
It just depends on where we live I'm not gonna go to a place just because of a school
No.
I just know that Wood End Way is really crap.
Mm.
But  might have changed  headmasters have changed.
Curriculum might .
When I was there it was   You agree don't you?
Yes.


Right.
We're having a sleep.


Never.
really.
Tell you, if we were in Yorkshire I'd send him to the, the, that er the convent school that I went to.
As long as they're not cruel.
Oh they weren't they were great you know.
That school, that school made more of an impression than I mean it was, if anything they were too soft.
I don't mind a bit of discipline but I don't like cruelty.
I remember when I was at er   tech I was reading and when I read I'm absorbed, you know what I mean
Yeah.
I don't hear anything.
And I was reading, I wasn't even doing anything, I was just sitting reading and the teacher walked in and I didn't hear him.
Didn't hear anything.
The next thing I knew he was pulling me up by my hair.
Shh yeah.


Yet you would have thought that you know, it wasn't as if I were disrupting the class or anything.
Yeah the very first school I went to was quite disciplined.
I don't, it was very, it was very old fashioned really.
There was a lot of bullying and what have you, you know.
No I don't want him to go to a school where there's a lot of bullying.
Admittedly 
Yeah.
You see I'm worried, I was actually the young- the youngest in the school  you know when I started.


You're noisy this afternoon.
What are you doing to that shoe lace?
What are you doing to that shoe lace?
So he's  you've had a fun day haven't you Guy?

Ah.

We've had 
Shoe, shoe, shoe.
A shoe.
Yes.
Shoe.


trying to get out .
Now do you're shoes up properly.
To be honest  you'd be better off instead of aiming for Watford going straight across.
Straight up here?
No, no.
Oh.
Keep going until um.
You know where as you normally turn left
Yeah.
Here  going to Watford.
Mind you you can always go up that way.
Use the other road.
If I can go up here and cut across a
Yeah cut across that should be 
Yeah.
you're going out of your way.

Wonder if it's this road surf- there's a feeling a bit of vibration on the steering then.
It's nice up here isn't it?
Yeah.
Anything's better than Northolt.
Well yeah..
They've got .
Oi oi oi oi.
What a noise.
Well hopefully we'll be moved before er Christmas.
I know.
Just never seems to be, we never seem to have a lot of time .
No, there's no point in moving unless it's  I'm getting er  a lot of money.
No.
Ideally I want a job where I get relocation.
You'll just have to remind me.
I haven't  haven't come from it.
I'm not used to coming from this direction so just remind me where the turning is.
Oh alright then.
Oh there's that new building on the corner isn't there?
Yeah.
Anita was saying yesterday about erm  where they're living now.
And er  you know there's 
next one  
Next one.
Right.
There's a lot of old people there and er  there's a  quite a way to walk to the shops.
Yeah she's not in a very good position 
No she was saying they have built some shops where they are.
Thousand pounds a week or something  rent.
Yeah .
I told you that there was going to be some available but 
It's it's well.
They're dreaming.
Well nobody's gonna take them.
Ah.
She can't afford to though can she?
No, not now.
That's fine.
I mean you might expect to 
Oh yeah.
They've done it nicely.
asleep now .
I mean, living up that end it's not so bad is it?
Well yeah.
Well no they're just 
No.
Yet  in comparison to what 
Whereabouts is this?
Well, yes and, yes and no.
I know.
It's very er, very narrow road this isn't it?
Can't get her in any tighter.
Yes we can.
Just pop round and er  see that shop.
Don't know  that one goes through.
He's got good access here anyway for 
Mm.
I've got a feeling for the number of empty sites they must have hammered the rents or the rates or something.
Mind you he's got it all worked out so  right we know it's six, six pound per square foot  is what we'll pay.
What you've got to remember is that this is er  this is southern England and not northern England.
.
Oh no you can get, you can get er  six pounds per square foot is quite a bit.
I mean you can get units sort of er  I'd be in inner London for that price.
It's just getting them with access that's the problem.
Well that one looks a bit promising anyway.
Mm.
Down here?
Mm.
still sat there?
still in Devon .
Well it needed gutting and starting again.
But it's just sat there.
Doing nothing with it.
Crazy.
planning on pulling the whole thing down.
Now then what do we want.
Erm suppose I better check that round.
This?
This is the, just over there that's the  A1  intersection.
Don't know what these councils are playing at though.
I mean they'll just they'll just have it sat there empty, it's been empty a year now.
Perhaps they decided a bakery isn't the right sort of thing for it.
Well no there were other people  have applied.
Yeah.
They , just not let it.
Shall shall we go back round there?
You wanna go to  Pullens don't you?
I don't want to it's up to you to say!
Well I don't know cos  you know the way  sort of.
Oh well go up this way then.
back of the estate some place.
We are yeah.
Hang on I'll have a look see where we are.
Well this'll take us back
.
No lorries.
No.
This is where we've just been isn't it?
Go to your right.
Oh even a bus service.
Yeah you've got  comes up here.
And the three o six.
. There's quite a  service  buses plus they've got mini buses running around all over the shop as well so.
Aha.
See I mean look at that.
All those tru trucks are just parked up.
Even hire trucks there.
Yeah.
But I mean it's, it's money.
You can't have, I mean you can't have all this stuff .
Crazy.
  

That's a fire station.
It's all  half the trip.
Yeah it's offices, car parking.
There's no er  it's no good for lorries is it?
Not for the sort, not for the sort of operation you're looking at no.
Nice area.
office blocks.
It's a  modern enough as it is.
And they keep building them.
No I think, they were making er  lots of money out of offices but not any more.
Well there's not that many bloody companies left to put, to go in them is there?
No.
Is it round here?
Boreham Wood football club 
Straight over?
Haven't been down here for a while.
It's all  new to me.
. I've not been down here 
To set up that sort of operation  twenty four hours trucks rolling in and out, you've got to be on an industrial estate 
Mm.
There's no way you're gonna get round  whatsoever.
Right   Ah I know where I am.
Yes.
We looked at a bakery down here.
Mm.
And it was just so antiquated.
Big old stone ovens you know?
Hole in the wall job.
Oh yeah?
Not really suitable.
Well, it would have taken a lot of investment.
And it was only  it was a leasehold job.
Property needed quite a bit of work doing on it.


Just along here somewhere on the left.
Yeah that's it.
There?
Just gone past it yeah.
Right.
That's the one is it?
Well I didn't know there was anything up here I was just, I just come up here to 
That all looks  occupied.
see what's around.
up there.
Oh yeah, lease for sale.
I know there was a few different  up here.
two thousand square feet


That's what we want.
Mm.
Ah that's roll on roll off.
Yeah.
Mega.
Mega mega.
Yeah.
Mega bucks as well.
There we go.
That looks empty.
I don't see any er for sale signs up though.
It would appear there's a few.
Yeah.
office in the front.
again, easy access.
Yeah.
Just turn right up there and it takes you up to the bottom of the M10.
Which gives you the M25 and the M1.
Somebody must be letting the bloody things out .
Well they're all blank.
Well there's, there's some blank .
There's two units left.
So who would, who does them?
I don't see any er  notices in the windows like a telephone number .
Unit one and four are still open.
Oh this is where Mercury are.
Aha.
we use Mercury at work.
Yeah it's a pity you didn't wanna go for something bigger innit, that would have been ideal wouldn't it?
Roll on roll off .
If we were supplying Marks and Spencer in this country it might be the answer but er 
This erm  this used to be a  distribution sort of 
Well it looks like it yeah.
erm  golden something or other.
Diesel pumps and all sorts over there.
mm.
That's that one.
Maybe you can get it at a knock down price.
.
They'd have to knock it down a hell of a bloody lot.
That's not bad.
Mm?
 Bilton that's a company innit, that's not  an agent.
Is it.
Alright back it up a bit.
. Well I suggest that Bilton is, is the people you're gonna enquire with these two, for these two .
If you wanna take the numbers of that.
Number thirteen doesn't look too healthy.
Fourteen 
That's on the other side of the board.
The sign.
Yeah.
Where are we ?
Er
Sorry you're in erm West Radlett
isn't it.
Right beside of Rank Xerox.
Unit fourteen.
Biltons 
Good god that's been there a long time.
It's still o one.
Yeah 
Is that gonna be an oh eight one of you think?
That'll be an oh eight one.
Erm  no oh one's Inner London so it's gonna be o seven one innit.
.Mhm  so he's got a few possibilities.
Yeah.
Those two round there look quite er   
Tasty.
Yeah.
Right erm  hang a left .
I think  those two round there might, like those other two on the other one.
They're newer so that more easily adapt to what
Yeah.
Oh I think I might just put some petrol in over there.
Look like they've  got an offer on.
 

Monday Wednesday or Friday .
Bloody hell.
Is Tesco's still open?
Yeah.
No idea.
No they open on a Sunday 
Sorry?

Doesn't matter I mean, it'll go for a long time you know.
Just  last another week yet.
left up here.

Used to be a bus route.
This one?

Left and a bit of a right I think 
I've got a feeling  we came to look at something round here.
Yeah we did.
We did come and have a look at a shop down here.
Like that one?
It could be.
There was one for sale down here.
Supermarket, supermarket.
That's empty.
No for sale on the bugger.
They've got a supermarket, if that's a hairdressers that hasn't made it, it's not a good sign.
Newsagents  hardware  that's gone as well has it?
I wonder if they're terminating the leases.
Rebuilding.
It's council isn't it?
Yeah but, well that side of the road's probably still going.
Probably gonna redevelop one side then redevelop the other.
That'd be  council wouldn't it?
Ooh  isn't that clever!
Come on then darling.
