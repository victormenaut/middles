Where are those tapes for erm  that you said I could have?
Only one.
That's all right I mean like I actually sort of worked out about another two or three tapes  yesterday.
The only thing see is that it's all my own tapes they're such crap ones and like they just sound really bad when they're recorded on.
It's like the same thing with video tapes they all get buggered up.
So I've got to sort of I've gotta record a .
that tape 
Is it a ninety minute yeah?
I don't know  lunch box 
Oh yeah, all right.


Searching through that  there might be but I  to choose

I quite enjoyed doing that actually.
It's too much to try and  do it all as well as.
mm.
synchronise 
Yeah  Lis Lisa came in  yesterday when I was round at  Zed's and she was complaining about how her keep fit class they bloody put on rave music.
Yeah well that .
Not necessarily I mean it depends on what sort of people come to your keep fit classes, but I mean.
My age group.
Yes well for your age we yeah.
I mean when you  warm 
Well you yeah.
I mean using rave music cos it's got a beat innit, it's got a lot of beat in it.

I'm surprised we didn't get swimming actually seeing as we got a fucking swimming pool right over the road from us.
I er I dunno I think you maybe do in the fifth year but I doubt it, but I mean it's so stupid though we got it opposite our school  I mean it's not as if it would be that difficult for the people in our school to pay for us.
I mean like people come in and pay for it.
Yeah.
Ouch.
God I've got  just so many spots at the moment.
Can you remind me to take this tomorrow mum yeah?

I suppose it depends on who's  doing or whatever.
Mm.
Y You and Deborah were talking about Dan and Honey yesterday weren't you?
Can't remember if you told me not to mention it to you or not that  was it that it was supposed to be a private conversation, I can't remember.
No.
No, maybe not maybe it was someone else.
You cos you know Bonnie yeah,sh she erm  got offered a er job in Glitters in Camden  yeah it's a shop in Camden, and sh she told Honey and Dan about it yeah and the next thing she knows yeah like the next day, she's talking to Dan and Honey and Honey comes out and says oh I went down to Glitters and asked for a job  right said right to Honey's face I mean Bonnie's face.
Mm.
and you know and then they said the same thing to her they said come back next weekend and we'll sort it out.
I mean but don't you think that's a bit out of order Bonnie got offered a job, so Honey goes and tries and gets it.
Glitters is a really gothic shop in Camden with erm all this sort of  and leather pvc gear, it's a really good shop actually, but it's a bit of a rip off some of the people try and rip you off unless you're a respectable adult-looking person.
I don't know actually, she hasn't really said that she wants it she's talked about it, but she hasn't said whether she wants the job or not.
Oh are you gonna do toad-in-the-hole?
Yum.
on the bottom under the  under the 
What time are you gonna get the meal ready for cos I need to have a bath?

No, he just 
Did those erm  other sausages
Yeah yeah.
Why?
Well it's just not very nice sausages.
Oh.
What did he say?
I I dunno I I  I can't work out cos all of Dan's girlfriends yeah Amber, Sonia and Honey  most people have all said I don't think she's right for Dan and you know  I can't I can't work out whether they actually think that or they're just sort of saying that because he doesn't talk to them as much or something, I don't know.
No.
I mean but I mean I suppose it's true with  with Sonia and with  Honey cos I mean like  Honey's a nice person, but there's three things about her which are very bad, and that is like she takes the piss  erm she's lazy.
is lazy as well.
I know when he told me about when  Zed told me about how she said oh,
No she didn't say anything.
What happened?
Can you pour water.
that she could  could make the tea or something you know, him having put the cups out and everything and I  I put the teapot there and said put two tea bags in it  and she just 
Oh I I've 
 
Then there sh she takes the piss, she's lazy.
She's not that shy though  
and she takes liberties as well.
She takes really bad liberties with people and oth and other peoples things and stuff.
Amber, well she doesn't talk to Amber any more.
Amber did something really nasty to her.
Yeah, Sonia is just a complete cripple.
You know you know Sonia' been kicked out of her house and she's in a children's home somewhere or something.
Yeah I know, I feel sorry for her but I mean like
That is awful.
The way she sort of I don't the way she sort of lead 
 
I don't know, I don't know  and she's still really madly in love with Dan or according to Paula.
.
And it was her fir her first boyfriend.
Yes.
I don't think her parents gave her much  very much freedom.
I don't know where her dad was, but she lives lives with her mum.
about fifteen notes yeah.
.
just sort of like a bit of rhythm to them and that's it.
.
But I mean it sounds really crap but it's just  I swear if he chooses me I'm gonna fucking slap him.

The one  had the disabled brother?
Their family was really big and they were really noisy people and Nigo used to fancy everything in sight, he used to fancy me and chase me round the playground.
Nigo?
Yeah it was something like that and he had a sister called Lisa  who was about a year older than me and I used to be best friends with her.
Well that's not as disgusting, I used to know a little kid that used to eat shit, by the way everybody, I just thought I'd let you know.
Dog shit that er
That makes me sick, I'm  sorry .
Alex  Alex
Alex  is that Ta er is that  how can you drink Tab Clear?

Can I have erm  Liam  can I have a light?
Can I just have a light off your cigarette then?
It's a disgusting habit it you know, you shouldn't do it.
Oh he always says that.
Peter you are a disgusting habit.
Why are all those, why do those people get thrills out of chucking balls at each other?
Because they're fucking got no
cos they can't get their leg over with any woman at all so all their life consists of is doing role playing.
Yeah have you noticed
Apparently she likes tumbling 
It's a really good game.
And  fancies every single one of them especially Alex.
have you got my magazine?
But probably not Philip actually seeing as he's her brother but you never know.
No maybe not.
You never know do you?
crisp roll.

The only way I like, salt and vinegar.
No can I have 
The only way I like salt and vinegar.
Mm?
Mm.
Ha?
Not that I can think of.
That stupid over athletic bastard.
Who?
Them lot?
Why?
Cos they're running around.
Over reacting about what?
No over athletic, they're running around  
Oh I thought you said over reacting.
actually give them any physical or monetary gain  it's pointless.
They just fall over and get grass stains all over their jeans, how can you get a thrill out of that?
Falling over.
If you get paid to do it or you were doing it for money I could appreciate it.
Well it's quite funny like, like on a hot, nice hot summer's day, yeah, when you feel like running about.
Yeah but it's really wet and everything.
But it's like nice it's
bit funny.
It's like a nice rather cool wet damp day.
Well I suppose it's better than football what they're playing innit?
Anything's better than football.
 
Anything's better than football.
It's quite funny watching them make complete fools of themselves.
X.
Oh fucking hell .
X
Mr , Mr  's first name, what's his 
Xavier.
Xavier.
How can Xavier be spelt with X.
Xavier.
Do you remember  that was spelt with X wasn't it?

It's exactly the same as yours.
What no fanny, it goes the other way.
Well so.
Well how do you know ?
I couldn't give a toss Peter.
Look that is incest!
Stop.
That is sexual harassment.
Oh God.
I'm cold.
Play this game then.
What?
Play this game then, it keeps you warm.
Oh yeah I'll get a real thrill out of that.
I'd rather fucking pick my arse.
No actually I wouldn't actually.
No I don't think so 
No it's not bad the game actually it's alright but it is a bit sort of like boring when it's, when you play it every day and it's sort of break your neck or something.
gay person that you know 
Oh I can't bloody tell you, I'm sworn to secrecy and I can't tell you.
Well I can probably tell you cos I, I know most of the stuff that Cassie's sworn secret cos she normally tells everyone else.
Who is it, Alex?
What is it,
Alex?
Alex who?
I'm not telling you.
What's this?
What?
Someone I know who's gay.
Only a few people know.
Do we know them?
Do I know?
What did some 
Yeah you know them, you all know 'em.
did somebody go up to Miss  and say 
Who ?
No, well Pat  is gay anyway, everyone know  is gay but that's beside the point.
It's James.
James?
I don't think James is gay.
No no no no.
Can I just have a drag?
Oh I thought it was Liam  at first.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Go on, go and chat up erm
No I fancy  
go and chat up Nick go on.
Who, who would tell Cassie their secrets?
No it wasn't, the person didn't actually tell me
I'd never tell Cassie  
it was one some
Oh for God's sake.
it was someone else that told me but told me not to tell anyone and I had to beg it out of him cos I just wanted to know.
Are they here now?
No.
Are they related to anyone?
No well not that I know.
There is one, there's like things that I would never tell anybody
What?
is that who fancies whoever or what 
they're the two things that I'd never tell anybody.
The only thing I don't really tell anybody is my
Or basically anything 
thoughts if I told someone my thoughts they'd be absolutely disgusted.
 

What ?
Did you say pizza?
No   whoa whoa!
 
Hello  
any fags?
Got any fags?
Pardon?
Give me a fag.
They've all buggered off, if they're not there and they're not here  
 
If they're not here and they're not there 
Oh has  and that gone?
Are they not there?
Oh yeah.
Oh I'm gonna take my coat 
join them  
Yes I look like shit.
no one 's actually talking.
Yeah I know but who gives a shit.
And where's your microphone?
It's here, I, I forget that it's recording so like when people aren't talking I just sort of think fuck it.
Everywhere he goes   
No if people are having a conversation
Fuck it I wondered what the bloody hell that was !
I thought 
 

I think what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go and stand in front of everybody while they're trying to  just to annoy them.
Okay go on then.
Stand behind them when they walk backwards.
That, in front of Mohammed 
And they've gotta try and walk backwards I'll just sort of go whoop!
I used to, every time like when we was playing football at primary school 
Whoop!
every time somebody shot a goal all, everybody, they always walked backwards like a foot.
That's supposed to be a trick when someone attacks you, if they attack you from behind you're supposed to walk backwards.
And like instead of running forwards while they grab on to you if you step, walk backwards it makes them fall over.
See what happens is they always  backwards even if they're right at the back of the field so you find someone you don't like and you go behind them trip them over  
Didn't fucking work did it?
What?
Oh!
I'm gonna break this  on the ground.
Oh God I hate having so much shit in my pocket!
What a pleasant game.
Brrrr   Right well I'm gonna go and annoy everybody.
have to say a lot  you have to talk a lot.

How do you know?
whenever I try to like start a conversation 
I dunno  if you haven't done anything wrong I mean most of the time  I mean every time Eleanor's erm stopped talking to someone it's always usually erm her misunderstanding  something .
Remember the time we stopped talking to her and erm she just thought that you weren't talking to her because you probably didn't hear something she'd said?
Do you remember?
got it the wrong way round.


Oh what does that poster say?
Is that about the festival?
Yeah it is.
Can I go and read it?
Maybe it might have some more information on it.
No it might have some more information, I won't be a moment.

Alright!
Look.
Stop whispering about me.
Oh yeah as if there's anyone else here to talk about round here that would, that would hear you.

Just  
Oh for God's sake.

That's what I thought.
And then I came, I thought oh  I can't find  actually, there's some here right, and she weren't gonna give them to me and I sort of went in there and got them myself.
No erm but I'm sorry but whoever did that needs a fucking good kick in the head you know.


Yeah I know.
If I find the person who did that, I mean even though it's, was no problem to me I'm gonna smack 'em
I know.

I know but I  but I don't know if I can be bothered  tonight.
Tonight?
Yeah.
Get drunk or?
Yeah.
Mm.
It makes me sick really.
Well that's probably the vodka that makes you feel sick, if you drunk other things you might feel a bit better.
No, no it's not cos if I drink other things then I feel really really sick,
Yeah.
I dunno.
Well I dunno, it's up to you.
I haven't got a clue what I wanna do tonight.
Yeah I just haven't got a clue   
No  not at all 
So anyway we've gotta go and see

We'll give it a ring.
Alright then.
Alright?
Alright see you later Cathy.
Bye.
Tt ooh!
Ouch my neck hurts.
Mm.
Sorry about having a go at you two about talking about me all the time but I mean that's the w that's, that's the impression I've always got.
Well you  
Cos every time I turn around yeah cos you two always sort of w looking at me and whispering and, you know,m half the time you have been talking about me cos I've heard you mention my name and it's not very nice.
Yeah but me and Catherine really don't talk about you know.
You do!
People have told me.
Well what have I said about you then?
I don't know.
Well then.
But I mean I, I'm not stupid you know.
I didn't say you were.
Well seriously Cass like the only thing like that I've  ever said about you like  is that one day in the classroom right there was this picture of this naked woman on the  right?
Mm.
And, and I drew some  boobs on it and put Cassie next to it .
But it was quite funny really .
And also  you said, you were going, you were taking the piss out of me about that thing I told you about something to do with Aaron erm
When?
when we were round at  oh do you remember I told you about me, when I thought erm I saw Aaron try and touch my face, yeah?
Yeah.
Right when it was pitch dark, yeah, I was half, I was still pissed and I was half asleep and you were p taking the piss out of me behind my back about that.
When?
Catherine told me!
What did I say?
No I don't know what it was but Catherine was t telling me the other day about how erm oh I told you something about that and you t and you t were talking to her about it.
Well I wasn't taking the piss out of you, I might have told her.
Well she said you were.
She said you were both taking the piss out of me.
And like you know it's not even always behind my back, you two always sort of I mean Cath when I'm not er I mean like I, I mean I'm, I've gotta, I've gotta tell you some time because when I'm on my own with Catherine yeah?
Mm.
She agrees with everything I say, she's never horrible to me, but when you're around she's really horrible to me and like, even though she's agreed with something I've said earlier, she just sort of goes yeah right Cassie ha ha ha it's really funny and takes the piss out of it and you sort of go along with her and I just sort of have to stand there while you two stand there laughing at me and I don't like it.
But she makes me laugh though.
No it's, yeah well I know but I mean like it's not the point whether she makes you laugh.
I dunno, whenever I'm with her though I'm always with you as well, like if I was with her right on her own
Yeah.
then I would like  er we'd just talk about, I don't know  whatever, she'd probably agree with everything I said as well because that's what Catherine's like but when she's like with the rest of us she  
I'm not, I'm not I'm not putting it on you anyway mostly it's c mainly fucking Catherine, I'm beginning to s not like her any more the way she's going  and don't you dare mention a word of this that I'm saying to you
say anything  
but I've gotta, I've gotta, I know, I've gotta get it off my back though because it's really pissing me off.
Anyway she can just be such a bitch sometimes you don't really know her that well you know.
No I know.
No she does  to you though cos she's always going on about other people  talking about other people.
I know, I mean er I mean yeah I've got used to her sort of like criticizing everything and everyone in sight cos I mean that's all she ever does is to criticize and complain.
I know but when I'm with her a lot I really  to talk about like  is about other people so like I do it as well but like I don't
Yeah well I do the same when I'm with her.
I know, I know  you know that I go on about Jenny
Yeah.
but I like, I like Jenny really.
Yeah I know I like Jenny I mean, but I never really say anything bad about Jenny.
say anything about you  like it's only if I   got nothing else to say really 
Yeah.
about me don't you when I'm not there, yeah?
No I don't, I don't.
Well she might.
Well she might erm no she's never, I don't think, I don't think she ever has said anything, she might have said it once but not that I can  recall mys oh doesn't that look lovely with all them petals falling off the tree?
Yeah stand underneath it, but anyway
Have you seen our cherry tree in the garden ?
We've got one of them in our front garden.
It's one like that except a lot smaller with little red berries that grow off it  in the spring.
And it's really nice!
Yeah but I mean anyway I dunno I just get really pissed off with Catherine.
Yeah but I get really pissed off as well cos I  well I, I won't like  when I'm with other people like and I talk about other pe like when I talk about Jenny and then I feel sort of like really two faced when I like start talking to Jenny and stuff.
Yeah I know but I mean
Cos I mean like do you do that as well, you know when you're with Catherine like you talk about people like Rosie or anybody  
Yeah yeah I d do I mean I do that, yeah.
I dunno who, who do I m I don't know, I d do that to s er see there is somebody that I do that quite a bit to but I can't remember who it is  or a few people maybe.
cos Jenny didn't even know that you could bloody put on weight by drinking.
Yeah well it's a bit that's the truth though I mean that is a bit silly isn't it?
Yeah.
I mean I, I mean I dunno I mean I just, I just ha , I just had to tell you because I mean it really is pissing me off the way fucking Catherine treats me, she was alright before  like and when I'm on my own, no 
What, before she met me.
Yeah I mean I'm not, I'm not saying you're a bad influence on her now, I think she's  just sort of jumping in at the chance for someone to victimize personally.
And l and  especially yesterday yeah, you know when we were standing in the foyer after school yeah?
Yeah.
And I, and you, you were going on about something to do with your job yeah?
And I said I want a job and, and she said something like oh well it doesn't include you so ha ha ha ha and thought it was really funny.
How would, how would she like it?
That's like saying piss off I don't like you you stupid cow, why don't you go and kill yourself basically.
Well you laughed and you were sort of and I just sort of told her and said shut up, shut up and stop being so bitchy.
I've got it on tape  I can prove it.
cos I, I really like her, I think she's like really funny like so whenever she says anything then I laugh at it like cos I think   
I don't know actually I don't actually know why you find her so incredibly funny because


I mean yeah she is funny, yeah, but th not to the extent that you find her funny like she'll be just standing there and you'll look at her and you'll start pissing your knickers.
I know, I love the way she does like  
I mean if anyone else'd do something like that you wouldn't piss yourself you 
I know.
and it's  strange
Mm.
And I, and I  and the way she goes, I think  really funny as well.
Yeah  makes me laugh.
The way she those things with like her face and stuff, I don't know, just the way she stands, everything about her just makes me laugh.
Yeah I know.
See there's lots of people that make me laugh, Liam makes me laugh.
He don't make me laugh.
I know so you know  different people that make us laugh.
Peter doesn't make me laugh at all.

Are you getting paid for this?
No.
I just did it for a laugh.
Tell them to fuck off.
You're not getting paid for it!

Hello Norwegian people


hello erm I'd just like to say, yeah, if you're not doing anything on May the tenth right come to a gig at the Bull and Gate in Kentish Town, it'll be really good, honestly.
Oh here you go.
Ah.
Walkman's fixed?
Yeah cos I've got  
It's just an elec er just an electrical shop place.
Dunno John Lewis fixed my Walkman.

You're not supposed to do that, I'm not really supposed to make you say this is the band come to the gig 
Oh sorry.

Sorry  Norwegian people .
But I mean it is    Never mind.
How was school then?
How long have you been ?
As long as it stops.
As long as it plays I suppose.
How was school?
It was Mr  trying to be funny and


erm James and Alex and Danny laughing at him and thinking he's funny because they all fancy him


and that, that was about it  wasn't it Bonnie?
That was about the most exciting part of the day wasn't it?
I don't think women would even fancy Mr  let alone men.
Yeah I don't, I don't think even a fucking dog on heat would fancy Mr  for Christ's sake.
 
Is it still recording, yeah?
Mm.
We're doing that cos Mr  's not gonna hear unless I play it to him.
 
No should I go to school and say here look listen to this sir, you'll find it very interesting.


I don't, I dunno I, I can never work out whether I actually like Mr  or not  cos he can be, he can be, he's such a cunt sometimes


he's a real cunt but he's er he's quite funny though.
Dunno, what do you reckon on, on him Bon?
He's not funny at all, he's a bastard and he  and he's really really nasty  
I mean I know his sayings are most er erm fucking
You know  chuck him out right, the whole of the bloody lesson but you, you're not allowed to do that  and then they chuck him out again.


No and like they're, like Mr  was like taking the piss yeah right, everyone was clapping and cheering about something in the class, yeah, and Mr  opens the  Mr  opens the door and goes  stop that clapping, and shuts the door.
And that isn't funny is it?
No but of course James and Danny ma erm and thingmajig find it incredibly funny because they're incredibly thick and they have no sense of humour at all.
So you can hear mostly what I'm saying
Yeah.
but
Quite clearly.
that's because, you know, I'm better than everyone else  so that's why everyone has to see wha everyone, everyone has to hear what I'm saying   
 
Mm I wanna go down to the pub tonight.
Dan can you hear me?


Say it again.
I said Dan can you hear me.
Ever so slightly.
Is it?
Yeah.
Oh maybe the battery's running down, I mean can I hear it actually cos the batteries are running down.
Well it's loud where you are but
Oh just give it to me anyway.
Right all say something.


Fuck off.
Erm Bonnie say something.
Who me?
Yeah hello.

You're never gonna pass it.
Oh oh!


How many times you taken it now?
Many a time.
Twice?
Yeah.
If I don't pass it at the third time I'm just gonna give up cos I'm not failing more 
Third time lucky.
yeah I'm not failing more times than Dan, I mean it's not really 
Just get, just get yourself a f just get yourself a false driving licence or somehow
Oh yeah, yeah they're really easy to get hold of.
just write, just get a big just get a big piece of paper and write driving licence on it.
I know someone that sells them if you want one.


See look, look seriously man I'd do that
No I wouldn't.
if I didn't fucking pass.
I wouldn't.
if you get pulled over and they realize it's false then you're well shagged  apart from just driving a car you're also done for fraud.
Mm.
Well you're not the one who flipping made the driving licence so it should be the person you got it off for fraud.
I think that's what 
Yeah well you bought it though  didn't you ?
So, you'd just say oh I didn't know it was erm false  you just say 
Oh yeah I, I I, I really think that you can just go and buy driving licences over the counter just like that.
Yeah.
You should just say, just sort of pretend 
This geezer 
just pretend you're   dunno   
this geezer from Bedlam yeah got stopped the other day in this car yeah, he was pissed, he was tripping and he was speeding yeah, no M O T, no licence, no tax, no ruddy insurance yeah 
 
right he's getting put away.
I didn't know  
And a stolen car as well.
 
Oh I thought, I thought  and they let him go  and I thought if you said that, you know  bit unbelievable.
Oh cheers Dan, you know  great fucking present.
Are those the ones, they're not the ones I gave you are they?
No these are 
Ow my arse hurts sitting on here.

What did you say?
Oh!
Say it again.

sex cos you forgot to turn it off after you had a conversation with Honey  or something.
Dan there's a lot of bollocks on it but never mind, it's not very interesting what I've written.
I have to write what I've been talking about.

Is that your dad in Australia or the one that's  
No that's my real one.
I mean my false one.
Yeah you're  false one .
How can you have a false dad?
 

That's a brilliant photo.
Can you just imagine him going ooh no sorry he's not here and
  
in the bigger one  there's someone taking a picture   er I don't really no .
But damn it it was so wicked, remember the flash geezer from the seventies, yeah, they're going  right  just down the road, they're all going I don't like him and he's going look  just let me do it my way and you do it yours right


and he's going  
 
and then the flash one comes in, it was Greenwich yeah, he owns this like 
Yeah.

It was Blackheath 
yeah Blackheath village, and like loons and like flares and stuff yeah and he says, they say it was  
Flares are us.
yeah flares are us, Peter Richardson but he was playing this like I can't remember who it was,s early seventies seventy one seventy two  kind of like detective yeah and they say whoa how the bloody hell do you solve crimes?
Jason  his name was.
Yeah, cos they find out right that he's erm
I don't know his basic name.
Well my dad said it was someone who was on but I don't know who it was 


 
I think it was like, it was just like yeah just like Steed from erm like 
Dan can ?
the Avengers or something but more camp.
  



and they're going the flares are us and he goes bloody southern bastards 
  
he just stares out of the window , yeah,
 
just stares out the windows right
and  like  they run down the stairs and run back up the stairs, yeah, and they're looking out the window  out the window and they go why the bloody hell are you always just looking out of windows and he's going do it your way and I'll do it mine.
 

And then Jason  yeah and they're like saying, they say look it was an early seventies crime you've gotta help us, how would you handle it  because they're not allowed to use fast cars and guns and he goes  find a country house 
 
yeah, and I, I would find a country house cos that's where all the crimes happened in the early seventies, I'd go in, make myself at home and smoke fifty cigarettes and drink a bottle of claret


and nab the bastards.


And he s and then in the end, do you know how like Steed  
and goes oh I think there should be a manor just up here  
You know what Steed did in the Avengers yeah, the way he likes hits people with his cane and looks like he isn't actually 
Yeah.
fighting, yeah, well they finally get Spender and the bloke from the Sweeney and the  trying to shoot him but Spender's going that won't work, they don't things like that any more cos they can't use shooters yeah, and then this flash guy comes up and goes so what are you gonna do  
That's because it's because you can't shoot people from like really far away  
It's like, yeah two hundred yards  in the seventies 
in the seventies but like er you can do it in the seventies you can't do it in the nineties.


And then this guy comes up and like  
 


yeah and he comes up
three yards away 
and he's like going oh what you gonna do then poof and he goes  I will look like I'm scraping my knee, nuts him in the balls, and then goes and I will knock some dust off my shoulder like  
And take, take a, take a sip of wine.

Yeah.

Oh it's got, got 
And there's all this stuff

it's got me going up to Alex saying er er no one wants to do it with me  and he's going look I'll sleep with you man so I'm going 
It's so funny though Dan I swear.
Er see you in a bit.
Alright.
Hang on, hang on  Has anyone got some spare money I could pay 'em back?
I haven't got any no, I can't 
And I've borrowed money to go out to shops in the first place 
How much money have you got on you Dan?
What?
Dan how much money have you got on you?
Oh sod it, forget it I'll just  
Did you are you trying to tell me you spent two quid last night?
I mean twenty quid.
No.
I've lost some though.
No well, well if you just put in  ha what are you planning on buying, a two litre or a one litre bottle?
I don't know yet.
There you are, there's enough for some Coke.
Right.
Oh I'll just get her a separate can of Coke then.
Okay.
if you see a bank
Ha?
if you see a bank
Mm.
a Nat West you can get money out
Yeah.
Ooh!
Blimey.
Ha?
Just milk.
 

Oh what, what did you piss?
Yeah.
Oh lovely.
Well I don't know 
Deary me, I was well drunk I s I haven't been, I haven't been that drunk since the Playpen gig.
What, what did you drink?
I mean 
I drunk rum  I, I didn't have  
got through about a third of the bottle.
I know and for some reason I was incredibly pissed.
I can't really handle rum, that's why I didn't drink any last night.
No I know.
I can a bit but
I ca I can't hold my spirits in that's the only thing.
Well the thing is I can't handle rum cos when I went to that party Dan  had
Yeah.
No actually come to think of it I was really pissed at erm Dan  's party as well actually.
No no not Dan  's Bonnie's party sorry  and I, I'd had er 
Did Bonnie enjoy herself in the end?
Cos I know that like she said she did but I know she was getting really pissed off cos everyone was sticking on the music she wasn't interested in and stuff.
Er yeah I think she, yeah she did enjoy herself, that's what she said to me.
Er I drunk erm  I think I drunk  two  two cans or maybe three cans of Scrumpy Jack and then a can of  Supertricks and I was well gone I, I had to pass out.
The reason I can't drink rum or vodka
Or any kind of spirit.
or  is because
Mm.
this was a long time ago  parties about two years ago
yeah.
I drunk half a pint of rum, half a pint of vodka and three or four cans of  
Oh yuck!
That is sick.
And I was really wrecked and I was I wasn't even actually ill I just sat, well I was eventually but I sat on this wall for about four hours, yeah
Mm.
and it seemed like ten minutes, yeah, but like Jim came out and said do you realize you've been out here for hours man


and like erm  just like all the  this party
Yeah.
but ever since I've never been able to handle it like I drink, sort of shove a few
But you drink whisky though.
Oh whisky's easy.
Yeah I know I mean like  I ca I, I can't, I can't hold down my spirits, I can hold down erm lager though.
Well I dunno, I can't work out what I can drink best.
The secret of drinking is just to know when to stop, you know you've just got
I know.
gotta recognize when you get to a certain stage that like if you drink any more you're gonna be ill.
Yeah I know but I mean like my mum was saying that you know  sometimes you're just pissed to stop and you just com carry on and stuff.
Yeah.
Do you reckon Dan might let me have a bit of toast when I get back or something?
Yeah probably.
Cos I, I just wanna line my 
I mean I think we have taken liberty a bit with his parents  but yeah I think you will be able to get some toast.
Yeah it's, it's just I wanna, I don't, I mean I, like my dinner last night yeah was a packet of Whotsits, packet of  beef flavoured  Hula Hoops erm a packet of erm  Monster Munch er two chocolate bars and a can of Coke.
Monster Munch 
What was that?
Oh  well but I mean 
probably wouldn't get any sex  have enough time anyway.
Yeah, no no I w I ate, that was my dinner, I ate that before I was pissed and that was my bloody dinner, I wanted to get some chips  no one would walk down the chippie with me.
I had a nice dinner last night, I didn't have my chips but I managed to get 
Yeah.
I wish I could cook that easily.
It's dead easy.
Yeah I know.
 
Just as long as you just as long as you know what, what doesn't go in what then like you can just chuck any old thing in.
I'll cook curry or lasagne but I never knew, I never knew the recipes I just sort of  stuff and think that goes together well
Yeah.
I mean Zed makes really really really really nice chilli.
Mm.
Yeah.
Fucking  makes a nice chilli as well.
No Zed's a really good bloke  when he's sober .
Yeah when he's not on fucking drugs, I'm, I'm really worried about him now you know  down there
No because I mean  I don't know.
It's not just, it's not just the fact that like he's my boyfriend, I've known him since I was bloody six or something.
Erm where's all the crisps and everything?
Is there any?
Have you got any crisps?
Oh,sorry   Ooh!
Oh I might get some  have you got sal any salt and vinegar ones of these?
Mm alright.
yeah.
Yeah I know it's, I just, it's just I like these ones in particular.
Get this Cass.
What?
like Pepsi.
One pound  how ca come?
I don't know.
That should b only be like about eighty nine P or something usually.
It's a rip off.
Well if you d yeah if you were buying, I was gonna say if you were buying cheap  you shouldn't buy cheap coke, it's alright to buy cheap lemonade but not coke.
Yeah.
they all said Coke.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah I remember Honey wants a can of Coke.
Have they got any of them cold?
Well no, ooh  dunno, don't think so.
Have you noticed the way Coke tastes so much nicer when it's a glass bottle?
Yeah.
It does doesn't it?
It's weird innit?
I don't know if I want any chocolate or not.
I want lots of crisps though.
One sixty three please.
Cheers.
Is that yours?
Where you going?
Ha?
I wanna get some fags.
Well you can get cigarettes from there can't you?
Er I don't remember seeing any.
I think you can.
Do they?
Do you, yeah, do you sell cigarettes?
No they don't.
That's odd, going into a shop that sells everything else but no cigarettes.
Well it's not really cos it's a general store 
Yeah, I don't know it's just a bit strange.
  

Oh.
bank anywhere.
I  my money l last time and they took up the limit on my cash card.
Yeah.
Do they do them in there?
They must 
Oh.
How many cigarettes have I got left actually?
Look  oh well, yeah but that stuff's horrible though.
forty  fifty, yeah I've got enough to get home.
How comes you're not at university though?
Is it still Easter break for you?
I get a month off.
Oh what a lucky bastard.
months off.
I haven't got, I haven't got any school on Monday but I have gotta get up early.
Actually, I don't half fancy a chocolate drink in here.
Do you think I should buy one?
Mm?
One of them chocolate things.
How much are they?
Dunno, I'll ask.
How much are these?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, how much are these?
Er  fifty P.
Fifty.
It's not worth it.
Oh God they look well nice as well.
The Mars Bars might be cheaper.
Yeah oh I dunno but they're sort of too thick and gooey.
Yeah.
No I mean, I dunno.
Oh don't worry about it.
Is that Pepsi or Coke you've got there?
Pepsi.
Fine.
I bet you prefer Pepsi anyway.
I prefer Coke but never mind.
Oh sorry.
That's alright.
What year are you at school now?
The fourth.
so young.
I know, every, everyone says that to me, it's not fair.
Right gotta make sure she sends me a birthday card.
Well when's your birthday?
In about two weeks' time  not even that much, yeah about two weeks I suppose on May the ninth it's my twentieth birthday.
Oh May the ninth?
That's when the festival is in the park.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well I'll have to get hold of your address and I'll send you a birthday card  but I might not actually send you a real birthday card, I'll probably send you like a piece of paper saying  happy birthday  or something.
Yeah alright, that'll do


someone remembers.
Yeah.
I don't mind it's just that
Mm.
God you're gonna be fucking twenty.
sort of keep in touch.
Yeah.
Ah we were supposed to be gonna like have a little gathering for my birthday party, well not normally a birthday party 
Are you gonna come down for the festival?
No I'm not, I don't think I am gonna come down cos I've been down so long anyway
Yeah.
but what I meant was is that we were gonna have a sort of  a little gathering before but I suppose we could have that today sort of.
What  today?
Well you know la later on.
Yeah.
And I, I dunno, are you gonna go to the party tonight?
I do I don't know, I doubt it.
Yeah?
Oh well see how it goes.
I mi I might, I might go I mean it depends on money things and stuff.
What like you finding a fiver in the street sort of thing?
Yeah see I've only got like erm  two quid on me and I need to get home tomorrow and  and I won't have anywhere to stay cos Dan and Honey aren't going  and I'd rather stick with them and Emma and Nick and just go back to erm Nick's house
Yeah.
I mean you know I can't be bothered trying to  so I don't think I will go.
Well I dunno I mean you can still be  you can stay at my place.
Can I?
Erm I dunno I think I might just go home and go out with Bonnie and Catherine and see Body of Evidence.
No actually  I've gotta see Zed 
Yeah
some time this weekend, I sort of 
you  really haven't you?
Well I don't know he's, he's a bit ill really so
You'd better see if he's still alive.
I'll see if he's still alive, yeah I know.
I can't be bothered trying to talk him out of taking drugs cos it won't work.
No.
He'll find out in his own time.
I mean does he really go over the top?
Ha?
Does he really go over the top?
Yeah I mean I'm not all I'm not, he told me not to s actually say what was wrong with him though, I can't say.
Well that's that's alright, no no
Yeah.
I understand that it's just that
I mean if he keels over and like goes into a coma then I'm all then I'm allowed to say what was wrong with him  but I mean yeah he did do
he sa I don't know he said, said he went to the   he kept on  getting it, offered  of speed and he just sort of took more and more and more and people were saying that he couldn't walk straight and stuff  which er 
But what what about the Playpen as well?
Yeah I know he took fucking  and drank quite a lot as well and he was well buggered.
I don't know   he's a really nice bloke oth otherwise but  
I know.
because like when I see him, you know, and he has been sorted out a bit recently   not really sorted 
Not, not in particular.
not properly but he's been better 
Not espe only a little bit though.
Well no but I mean 
I mean he's not doing speed every day now but I mean
well he's  to weekends a little bit.
Ha?
He normally  to weekends now.
Yeah.
But I mean  I dunno it's just that he was, he was, you know he can be a really nice bloke
Yeah I mean like  it's like 
he's got he's just got old before his time really hasn't he?
Yeah he has.
Well, well too old, he's gonna be fucking
That's what I mean about when he sort of ran off that night I thought, in one way I was pissed off with him but in one way I thought well at least he can  you know?
Yeah.
Well yeah I mean, I mean the thing is it's like  why have you got those headphones round your neck?
Why've I got what?
Why have you got headphones round your neck ?
Well because you were giving me feedback so I 
Oh right I didn't, I thought I just left it there.
No the thing is I mean like Z Z Z Zed's, Zed's, Zed's not just a boyfriend to me because he's a real good friend of mine as well.

this bloke and his bird, right, and then ahead wouldn't like it clears up a bit in, in the Blackwall tunnel but it's still like sort of five yards in between each car and he's just like moving from lane to lane without signalling or anything
Fucking hell.
and everyone's sort of going  
I had this really weird dream yesterday about handbrake turns


I dreamt I was like going, I can't remember what was, what I was doing, I was running, I was driving away from somebody, yeah,
Did you do a handbrake turn?
and I did a handbrake turn, yeah, and it didn't work and I went whizzing into a tree  totalled the car.
What were you driving?
really odd dream once yeah I dreamt, I dreamt this tube of, tube of toothpaste was trying to get me and every time it hit me I lost 


What?
Too much computer games.
I dreamt we were all playing  what would  do in this situation in crocodile skin boots.
 

Oh they're wicked.
Did you see that snakeskin jacket 
at  party yeah  I was  in the toilet yeah and this bloke comes in and goes oh  and I'd only got like a hit's worth left
Where?
toilet, in Bon's, in Dan's loo at Bon's party  cos I'm going round  going oh no no no no I'll give you a fiver for it I went I really don't want to sell and in the end like I just said to him look just fuck off, you know cos like he was just persistent 
Yeah.
What time is it?
Er about ten past twelve.
starts to work.
Oi think of a project for me that I can do for the next seven weeks.
What can he do for  
Right draw er
loads of people with their heads being blown off .
Yeah  that's a good 
What's that?
Loads of people with their heads being blown off.
On what?
On the next 
For his project.
For the next seven weeks.
No  something serious.
Look I've wasted a week already man 
Have you seen ?
Yeah, yeah that's brilliant .
Have you seen it?
Do a picture, do, do like a series of pictures, yeah, but it's concentrating on the face but like the eyes and just try and capture a different personality from different looks of the eyes.
am I advertising something now?
Or like promoting something?
Erm
An illustration for a book maybe.
Oh Cassie I've just gotta see if this picks up.
No look it's it's,
 
illustrations to books like
 

Dan do an illustration for kids books cos they're really easy.
No but he's a graphic designer, he's trying to sell you something.
No, yeah that'd be selling the book but
Mm.
Sell erm Monster Munch.
Yeah Monster Munch, do crisps, do a crisps series.
No I couldn't, I couldn't it's  
 
I've got it  marijuana's legalized and you've gotta do an advert campaign.
Yeah.
Yeah go on, go on.
Smoke Afghan!


Yeah right.
Afghan camel skin.


Yeah do 
That'd be so wicked.
 

Yeah because then you could have that, you could like have a story board for that advert that you thought of.
Yeah Dan, yeah you could do you know, we gave  one ounce of normal hash and one ounce of super zippo Afghan blue
 

Yeah that'd be so funny.
Er like one ounce has gone and we talked to some people who have tried it  it was alright but a bit gakky at times


right but super zippo Afghan blue is still going strong.


and there's this just this row of like rasta men


and they're all like by the end and then the other side are still normal.
 

Fucking hell Dan.
And do you know those advert features that they do in the States, they're like sort of like  half hour adverts, like they're like shows but they're like an advert
I've seen one of them.
Yeah, what for?
Erm some skin cream.
Well they did like a talk thing and people were like going yeah I feel the skin cream is really good, they just had a chat  
Yeah and that's what I put  call this number now, all credit cards accepted  and that was it and then stop and oh and have you tried the new so and so, buy it now or phone so and so, all credit cards accepted.
I always reckon the best adverts are the genius ones.
Don't you reckon?
Yeah.
And then this programme would come on like  
But now it's sort of, well no it's based very much on American sort of New York  
Yeah.
cos in New York they sort of like they have a chat  and the wo they've got some nice looking bird, right, and some sort of normal bloke off the street and they just sort of talk about New York and show lots of pictures of it
Mm.
But oh no you've gotta do legali er legalized thing.
Or you could do a legalized dope poster campaign.
Yeah post poster and advert like T V
about the story board thing.
You could do a legal you could do a l a legalized one.
You could have like, sort of show like  we gave, like, we gave one ounce of your average  and one ounce of Afghan blue


two sort of small  and then like you show these two kids playing a computer game going whee


and then this line goes  
 
you see them like from the front going beep beep beep right, this line goes down the middle  
 
and all this sort of like the ventilator shaft right there's all this blue smoke starting to pour  
 
and then it homes in on one of the men right and it goes sort of whee one hour later whee  whee bom bom bom and the other one goes one hour later right and the computer just explodes and it just goes boom 
Oh look wicked, wicked, wicked I've got a wicked campaign, do a dope campaign yeah, and like the logo is dope may d dope may be dear but you pay through the nose for coke.
Where did you nick that from?
Ah that's  
Sounds

No no no it was like erm Boojoo or something, it wasn't Boojoo but it was something like that.
Yeah like  Bammy or something.
Well that was his nickname wasn't it?
Couldn't believe that, we get in the door and he says, goes yeah man 
Oh yeah we thought he's alright, you know

You want some chicken and the rice


come in the kitchen  and like that weird sort of red rum gear he had
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Well if, if there was an effect it would be really small.

That's brilliant that one.
All this is gonna be in the teenage  on the revenge of the young  knuckles this is, this is true this story .

It's true as well.
What if there's like a book published in a, in about a couple of years time about the children's language  
 
mash up this place, listen to this.
   

Oh where is it?
Wicked.
 

Who wants to listen to  at the Gates of Dawn?

Oh wicked.
We're also gonna do Deptford City Hall.
 

Oh what, Brixton nick?
Yeah, no no no  you go off Deptford High Street it's got this big sign says do not enter flashing lights  you go down this alleyway and there's this like  tramp just sort of spit in your face going urgh off with you you laddie, right?
And then you go in a bit further and you enter the Deptford estate and this is random, you can like go north south east or west 


but now and again there's some like erm sub-circuits or whatever, sub programming that you'll appear right  there's Mermaid Towers right, you appear and you get trapped for seven years listening to this old man


The old hermit.
stays on it on the game for about twenty minutes  and he just sort of talks on and on


goes more, more, more.
I used to be a carpenter you know.
More, more more   and then there's this other one right, you get

How many more tapes you gotta do?
Erm  four or five I think.
Shit.
We'll get some at the party tonight.
Oh yeah that'll be well funny .
Mine and Aaron's  erm mine and Aaron's idea of sticking the erm microphone in the toilet, yeah,
right  hiding it and then erm later on during the party yeah taking the tape yeah and telling everyone to be quiet and listen to it.
 
That's a wicked idea.
You could erm you could, you could stick it in like the bedroom and wait for someone to go in and have a shag
Yeah.
that'd be funny.
I should've left it recording in your bedroom or something.
No.
God I've eaten so much junk this f food this weekend.

Nothing wrong with eating junk food is there?
Well it's not very healthy is it?
Ha?

No just the bloke.
Phil ?
Yeah Phil  that's it.


I wonder if they've got Thin Lizzie in Norway?
Mm.
See that geezer down there?
He looks like the one out of erm you know erm  Coming to America yeah, the one with the erm  sort of shiny greasy hair ?
Oh yeah .
Yeah that was so funny, you know the bit  he has to come up to the house  to erm  has, has to come up to the house
Oh yeah 
has to come up to the house to talk to him and erm  like he sort of opens the door and just shuts it in his face cos he finds out the other bloke's a prince and he's just standing there in the rain.
That was so funny that film I swear.
It's really weird my mu erm one of my mum's friends who's a bit of goer, she's got herself a new bloke called Jim yeah and he looks exactly like Jimmi Hendrix and he plays the guitar.
Wicked .
  

Does he, does he do it on purpose?
No, no I mean he just looks like Jimmi Hendrix he's not like a just a  bloke  really looks like him.
Can you share it with Honey?
Yeah.
Hey don't ask for any more right  greedy bastards, I dunno.
It was so funny when we recording in  Dan, do you remember when we were recording at Aaron's getting up?
I've gotta listen to erm  all that  stuff erm when Aaron and Alex were  
 
wearing strange attire .
What's that woman supposed to be looking like?
She looks like bloody  weird seventies 
pair of flares, that's what I say.
Yeah.
Bloody thing keeps on fucking cutting out.
You should really, you should find Jim tonight  and record yourself 
Oh is he coming?

Dan, did you hear what I said?
Pardon.
I said Phil    .
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
Mm?yeah?
Don't you reckon?
Oh God, can you imagine sitting there and actually just washing people's windows and trying to get some money, it must be so depressing.
Yeah I know.
It's so annoying when they just come up to your window whether you want it cleaned or not they just clean it.
I know.
I mean if they ever do that to me I'm just gonna fucking drive off.
my driving instructor always just goes blah and then
Yeah I know.
Well I think what I'll do yeah is like when they're trying to clean my window I'll open the gu and shoot er open the window yeah and I'll get out a gun and shoot them.
No no well you, well actually that's a good one, if you, they start washing the window, yeah and turn the wipers on and whoosh 
So there's splatters all over them, oh fuck   bloody cutting out.
That bloody museum's so crap.
Oh it is isn't it?
It's really boring.
It never changes its scenery or anything.
Oh there was this interview with Mick Jagger yeah but like it must have been written about  cos they described him as a neanderthal rocker.
It's not true.
Dan's got a new penis.
Coke can vibes 


 

Coke can vibes.

With the Coke can vibes?
Yeah.


Wicked.
Oh wow Thin Lizzie were so cool.

Why?
I always liked the Boys are Back in Town
Yeah.
I like Jail  
It's good no I tell you why I thought they were crap cos you gave me an album and it had the  had Dancing in the Moonlight and that was good but all the other songs on it were really shit.

Yeah.
Or something.
It's, it's rubbish.
Mm.
Alive and Dangerous is the best one.
God I hate this bus journey, it's so boring.
Oops  
Sniffing some coke 
They're go gonna get this tape right and they're just gonna think what the fuck!
None of the other people are probably gonna have stuff like this on their tape.
No.
Pete, Peter's one's gonna be like all intellectual people 
Peter ?
Yeah.


And
I'm sorry but  to call Peter  even vaguely intellectual just doesn't work at all.
No like and also there's Anthony  the biggest  ragger in our year.
What?
Anthony  the biggest  ragger in our year and there's Grace
Oh yeah I know.
who's the erm prettiest female biggest  ragger in our year.
Tell Grace to change 
That'd be quite good.
Sorry about stopping the tape but it keeps on cutting out cos your microphone is absolutely shit.
Pardon?
I was just saying erm sorry about keep on stopping the tape but your microphone is absolutely shit
Oh yeah.
and it keeps on cutting out, that's why I'm stopping it  by the way.
Oh God one more person asking me what this thing's for, yeah, tonight I'm gonna fucking go mad.
Ha?
What's this thing for?
Do you wanna slap Dan?
No.
Ooh!
That college is so shit, what did you just call it, Whackney college?
It was so shit  
Dan what did you just call it?
Whackney college?
Acne college.
Acne college  
It's such a fucking shit hole.
It's not as bad as   I think, I think the funniest thing was erm  is that  that Hackney Housing Office  down here looks just like a squat  is that the housing office for Hackney 
Oh yeah where is it?
is just miles  
Yeah I think I've seen that before  and er all that stuff  the big boy nut
Yeah .
went all along the one O six bus route.
I know.
Really really weird.
Do you know what that means?
It's like someone just got off at every single stop and wrote on it.
Have you ever seen the erm tag idea written all over the place?
No.
Oh well if you have   what?
Cos I know the person who wrote idea.
Who was it?
Some geezer called Danny.
What?
going round using their tags and reckoning they're .
Remember when Jonathan  used to do that?
Did he?
I can't, I dunno I never used to know Jonathan .
Oh right.
Did you know Tamsin used to go out with Jonathan ?
Did she?
Yeah, yeah erm 
he goes out with loads of quite, quite sexy women, I don't understand it myself  
Well you know he used to be quite good looking when he was younger but now he's really ugly.
No he's alright looking but he's just boring.
Yeah I know.
He rings you up and goes  he goes hello it's Jonathan  and you go oh right hello Jonathan and he doesn't say anything  so you talk to him for about half an hour or so and then you go alright Jonathan, better go, you know and then he goes  no no I've got something to tell you and you go oh alright what is it then and he goes I can't remember it man, just talk to me for a bit longer and I'll remember it then and it goes on like that for hours and hours and it's so boring.
Oh God.
Does he ring you up?
Off and on.
No he used to but   
He was so wicked

It's like you know when you, you 
Did you think Henry was quite good?
In a nasty  
Really really nasty though.
I love making stupid noises on this.
Ah that, Dan that     
This bus takes the stupidest route, it's 
I know darling.
If it just went in a straight line it would take  fifteen minutes.
I know.
But what kind of advert is that, come here and go away?
I mean I know what it means but like  Are you lot going to Italy this year?
Who with?
should take about ten minutes
Yeah.
and it takes about five fucking hours, it's ridiculous.
Like that, but the other thing, and the other thing about this bus ride is it's so horrible isn't it?
It's just like look, everything that you look at 
yeah, really 
Yeah.
Who is  I'm gonna kill that bastard.
Yeah, you know the bastard who draws those really crap pictures on bloody kebab shops?

That was so funny like 
I know.
I don't understand what he was doing with his  I mean that must hurt so much.
I can do that but I can't take it out of the socket.
It's really nasty.
That is just wicked, using his arse as an ashtray, that was just a classic that was.
We should've had a picture of that.
Is that it?
Is that the squat?
No that doesn't look like a squat.
Have we passed it Dan?
Oh yeah

No he'd love that though cos he could come round and go shit I've just come out of rehab and everyone would go oh wow man you must be really drugged out.
Yeah.
Oh God I hate this bloody bus journey.
Cos I think he's sort of realized now that nobody's particularly impressed by him taking six grammes and  twelve Es at once and going oh I took six grammes of  and twelve Es at once and I was really fucked.
Yeah I know.
So he, he needs something new to do.
What do you think he'll do next?
Go round and start murdering people ?
Yeah I should think so.
Come round and say oh I murdered twelve people today and then we'll all go oh wow Zed!
 

We should get off and interview Anna.
Oh yes.
Where's she live?
Just down there.
What did it sound like  to you?
Mm?
Did it come from outside or in here?
Bad boy  reaching Clapton ponds.
bus stop.
That's right.
Anna lives just down the road.
Anna  she's cool.
Her nose is a funny shape.
And she giggles a lot.
Ha?
She giggles a lot?
She's not as cool as she used to be, you know.
S she's started hanging out with fucking  Max and all the bloody teeny wankers.
Yeah.
God there was this spasticated kid in my school, you know Lucy ?
Yeah.
Yeah I was talking to her and she's got this ma he's not a spastic he's just got such bad taste in music and he just plays it like it's sort of like  
What's he like?
Erm  he, he likes  he likes sort of erm  Nirvana and  Frank and Walters and all these really 
Who's this?
crap bands and I'm going but they're so untalented, sort it out and he's going 
What's he saying?
he's just saying no but they're really good and I'm going but they're not, they're rubbish.
I suppose   Nirvana are the best of a bad lot by a long way.
Then why is it Nirvana never played  yeah I suppose you, I see what you mean yeah.
At least they bloody started it and they just didn't fucking jump on the bandwagon like everybody else.
Yeah I know.
Oh well they did actually cos they ripped off erm  what was that band before, I can't remember, Pavement they were before Nirvana.
Who?
Pavement.
They were what?
They were before Nirvana, they came from Seattle, they sound almost exactly the same.


Nirvana are just a rip off of them really.
Except Nirvana are better.
Nirvana are crap though.
I know they are.
Gotta listen to a little bit of 
Like Thin Lizzie.
Yeah!
Do you like the Black ?
Yeah they're wicked.
Yeah they're okay.
Have you got any of their tapes?
Have you got Hot to Handle on your tape?
Erm  well I've got, I've got the album with Broker Deal on it and erm  I've got another tape out which had Hot to Handle on it  see I recorded the album  
What?
I recorded the album I got you which didn't have  on it yeah?
And then I got another compilation tape with 
Can I tape it off you?
Yeah no the Black  are good but they do sound like the Stones.
The Stones?
Yeah.
Except with  the guitar so much.
How old are they?
I think  sound like the Stones.
Yeah 
Good though.
They do.
I don't think they do at all.
They do.
Some of their songs do.
And then he really looks like Mick Jagger as well which don't help.
Don't you reckon that erm the  are a bit of a copy of er Spinal Tap?
are a copy of Spinal Tap ?
Well they, they all look the same.
They, they  they  the people look the same as
They don't.
They do, that geezer with erm  moustache and  hair.
He looks a bit like Derek Smalls I know but 
Did, did you know that erm Spinal Tap was a film before the band came out?
Yes.
Yeah cos I never used to know that
But you, you
till I saw  
you seriously thought they were a real band?
Yeah well they were kind of after erm the erm thing.
They weren't really they were just like
Do you think they're good?
No they're music's terrible, they're quite funny though.
They, they've got one good, really good riff on erm  er Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You er  der der der der der der der der der der der  
Yeah I know I like that.
But I mean then, then again they don't do it very well.
Don't they?
If they left it in the hands of  it would be a much better song.
Yeah.
Cos they, they don't play with that much conviction, well I mean suppose they're not really musicians but  sound a bit crap.
Bad News are much better.
Yeah.
The music of Bad News cos 
what?
helped Bad News write most of the songs.
Oh right yeah.
So that one about erm  go insane and eat my brain baby  
I haven't heard that.
Oh that's brilliant that one is.
And like  what was that really good one?
There was Old Warriors of Genghis Khan
Yeah.
that was a brilliant 
oh yeah I have seen Bad News but I, I don't remember it very well, I remember bits of it.
Bad news der der der der der bad news 
Yeah.
Well erm have you heard that, that song Warriors of Genghis Khan?
What the nasty one?
What's that?
Just  
 
The nasty one with the stupid  video?
Yeah .
Yeah.
Yeah but they're just, they they're just, they're  they don't  do they?
They're just being really your average thick metal band.
I wonder what, oi Dan  Honey, I wonder what, I wonder what we'll be like when we get into our sort of mid twenties?
Probably pretty similar to what we are now I should imagine.
Do you reckon we'll still know each other?
Yeah.
Yeah I reckon.
Basically if the band stays together then we'll just still know the same people because
Yeah.
We've gotta keep it together 
Oh we will, we're gonna keep together till we're very wealthy.
Hopefully.
No well we'll, look we're getting quite, we're getting quite a lot of erm attention.
I don't mean like sort of you wish  like you wish that you  like you'll become rich or something.
I do wish that 
Yeah.
four thousand seven   four er forty seven yeah erm a grand total of forty seven thousand three hundred pounds.
What's that?
How much you've got?
I worked it out the other day, I've got fifty eight P.
Oh almost home.
Yeah nearly there.
Oi Dan  I've gotta, I've gotta play you, I've gotta play you later on of me apologizing to the Norwegians.
Oh why?
Oh what did you say?
There's just this, it's just really funny cos I sound really wrecked yeah and I say  look hello, hello look Norwegian people  I just want to apologize for all this mess and all this crap on this tape but I mean yeah like you know, fuck it


it's a laugh innit?
And then, and then Stitch sort of takes over 


and there's people  and then there's a bit yeah er someone said to Aaron you've got a bony arse and I'm standing behind you and I'm going yes Aaron you have a bony  arse .
Oh I said to Aaron that he had a bony arse, he does as well.
Mm.
Well don't you think  embarrassing?
No?
Oh I can't remember.
Coming down, slowing into High Street passing Stoke Newington Church Street and the Samuel Beckett where they're really crap and like don't pay you properly  oh no
Don't they?
no they do at the Samuel Beckett, it's the  and  okay, it's a good new Embassy advert  but I still don't smoke Embassy because they're horrible.
And  
  

Sing it like, like glow in the dark Embassy or something innit?
I like Embassy filter actually, you know the really small cigarettes, they're quite cute.
I wouldn't compromise with towels would you?
Don't you think those adverts for  erm the Vauxhall Corsa are really pointless?
All those ones with the supermodels sitting on cars?
The er the T V advert's quite good, it's quite stylish but
Yeah.
I'm sorry but does anyone actually use Stoke Newington train station?
I don't think so .
Only the people that work there.
But what I don't understand is though why we haven't got an underground station at Stoke Newington and why Stoke Newington train station isn't linked up to Whitechapel.
It isn't linked up to anything, it goes nowhere.
I think there's just one bit of line going from there like 
I, I think it goes to Canonbury and think it goes to Bethnal Green.
Great!
Actually does it go to Bethnal Green?
Cos if you got the train to Bethnal Green you could walk it from there to Whitechapel.
Well I'd rather not actually it's much better getting the one O six.
There is an underground at Bethnal Green isn't there?
Coming up to my house pretty soon  but I'm not going there cos it's shit.
 

I hope one of you  
We were gonna move into a house just down here when we erm  one of these ones, like a flat  one of those
A flat?
a flat in one of those.
Oh my God!
What?
You and who?
No, no erm  my family when I was really small but the, the flat was too titchy.
Yeah I know they are.
I hope Zed and Bonnie come to this party tonight.
Dunno 
What?
I dunno if Bonnie will, she doesn't go anywhere she's just so boring.
No she said she wanted to go to a party this weekend.
Oh right well 
And if not  
Oh shit!
Oh home ground 
What?


is just   I don't care what anybody says.


Have you got any orange juice Dan?
By the gallon.
Have you?
Yeah we've got loads left over from the funeral.
Still, I can't believe you've still got that 
No 
It's weird.
 

I'll have to make some phone calls when I get back to your house.
Oh I see.
Okay?
waste my phone bill.
Oh do shut up.
No can I use your phone?
Ha?
Oh don't be so sarcastic.
sarcastic, my brain isn't working at the moment.
My brain isn't  
Come on then.
manage anything as advanced as sarcasm.
Oh God you don't know how much my legs hurt.
It's bloody cut out again.
We're now getting off the bus.
Shit!
We're very nearly home.
I've got to pretend to be a reporter Dan.
Right, out on the streets again.
That bastard on that bus, when I got off I heard this voice saying  and I looked round and there's this  ragger sitting there  
 
I think he was about fifteen.
Oh you should've slapped him.
What's true?
It's true though yeah, I think 
They're so bloody thick, they're always saying that we dress like tramps yeah then why do they wear clothes with holes in them?
No man but they're so fucked.
No  raggers are fucking crap.
Yeah they are like  and like  they just don't grow up until the time  
I know.
I know I've never seen a grown up  ragger actually, they always go  no man look at the chief on that 
Look at the chief.
They just say, just say  the chief.
And like 
What is, what does chief mean?
All the people in my school use it.
And like I don't bloody 
It was quite funny cos I, I was walking down the road with my, my mate Robbie yeah   and he's gay  and, and they went  ooh 
No but what does chief mean?
and they went  boy and 
What do I'm sorry but what does chief man?
Dunno it just sort of means
It's such a  so stupid.
 

I mean that's like, that's like saying no man  you're such an umpire or something.
 


No man you're such a Red Indian.
No man  
We're now entering Dan  's house, this is where band practice was yesterday.
Much respect, kicking respect   kicking respect   kicking respect.


Dan's way of saying hello I'm home.
Oh I'm starving.
Kicking respect.
Oh my limbs hurt so much.
Oh I hurt so much.
I hurt.

What is potato and leek like?
Hello Norwegian people this is my fiance Honey  I love her very much.

What were you saying?
About, I thought you said something about tea?
I said what's potato and leek soup like?
Usually it tastes quite potatoey and presumably rather leeky as well I should imagine.
Hee hee hee yeah?
I thought that was, that was a really good line in that cook thief his wife their lover film where he went, he said something about she's great except she will keep popping to the John and then he went she's got a bladder like a leaky marrow 
Did he?
Yeah  that was wicked .
I'd be bloody embarrassed if I had a husband that looked like that I'd throw him away.
No man there is no way.
Hummus food of the gods.
Pardon?
is that?
What's that horrible smell?
It smells like Aaron's feet.
Oh God I've never smelt, I didn't wanna say anything but like I've smelt anything so nasty in my life except for Patrick's knob.


Seriously those feet were nasty.
Patrick's such a spastic.
Patrick could  
You haven't slept head to toe in a bed with him though.
Aaron.
No not Aaron.
Imagine that.
No I, I, I sort of smelt Patrick's feet once  and I thought if it was possible to faint  on smells then I was going to, you know.
I swear to God they're the most nasty things  sort of like Aaron's   
Dan  sweats nicotine.
Does he?
Yeah.
He says his sweat smells of Benson.
Urgh!
Disgusting.
