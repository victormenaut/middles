If I get him to go in there and do a bit of plaster on
mm
eh?what I was thinking of doing was getting a, have a go aye  you know builders merchant, pick up some plaster if its a wet day and start doing some plastering in there
yeah, well it looks through erm  need to use it soon isn't it?
I  well I reckon, the trouble is, it depends on how things go in the next couple of weeks
you can
the opposite, you can start as many  within the original firms 
anybody's  
yeah
that's right 
see I was thinking this was gonna cost a lot, a lot of money to put the phone's in, but its not, because you just put one line in and then put different bits up the line don't you?
no  no they come in, in separate lines 
but you cut it 
you charge pair, you'll charge pair  in here, its not just one line with four connections, they charge you per phone 
I was talking to Desmond about it and he reckons that once you've got your line you can muck about and
no
put quite a few lines in there
no, dunne work like that
oh 
you can use the same, you can use the same number  alright?
mm
eh, the same number on four lines, but if were want to go out  four people were to phone in at the one time
oh of course yeah
do you see what I mean?
I see what you mean , yeah of course you do
you've got to have four separate lines
yeah exactly the same sort of thing with the front room one and the kitchen one you just did 
that's right 
yeah
right, and then once your in, you can put, you can put in as many extensions up as you want
yes
but what I'm talking about dear, probably in
I'm talking you
aren't we?,
I'm talking about cord and five lines here for the minute  aye  and I'm talking about bringing in  talking about bringing in four or five lines down there, right?
mm, mm
and there's not any reason why once your in you canne put another couple of lines in, and you can even put a couple of lines in on a different number if you want
mm 
but still have to four phone in for the same purpose, are you with me?
mm
you could run them all end up with numbers 
mm
but really I've got to talk to somebody, I've got to talk to somebody for their
British Telecom
British Telecom about it
because, yes that's true, the
but there's a right time and a wrong time for doing it, see  cos basically if you were getting the money, the phone calls that were, that were done  a  since Christmas  right, I'm not sure how the bill runs, it probably runs December, January, February  er I think they run a quarter on the phone bill, and its a three month period
that's right, were gonna get a phone bill soon
so I'll be getting that phone bill within the next fortnight, right, but bear in mind June  June and December we weren't really doing anything for three weeks
yeah
right, and its only the last couple of weeks that we've really picked up 
yeah, hopefully the business coming in of, of this month  because of the fact that the, the volume of business bound to be higher
mm 
right  alright? and then what you do is, if you run a four phones, four or five phones through up top, for the next quarter, right 
mm
be getting a result  if you stepped in with another four phones, new lines, you'd have the use of these four lines for three month, to generate business before you get out with first phone bill on them, right  so that you could drop er the lines here if you wanted, at er, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter whether you've got one line  or whether you've got a hundred lines
mm
if you've got one line and its costing you money
yeah, yeah 
a hundred lines losing money is going to cost you a lot of money
yeah its all wrong 
if you've got one line making you money  and you've got a hundred lines, a hundred lines is gonna make you a hundred times more, do, do you see what I mean?
yeah
your lines are either working and making you money or there working and costing you money, and the supervisor's job is to make sure that whoever's working these phone's  is getting a result
mm
right  the more phone's used is somebody that is capable of making
for you 
yeah 
right, now what you've got to judge at the end of the day, now lets say for instance that you've put in six lines  six lines, right  and you only wanted to use two of them  all you've got a number for is the rental charge isn't it?
mm
so you only pick up your gain and drop your gain back
mm
right, so if I'm carrying six at the minute, you've got to say to yourself its stupid having six here
then only having four up there and that place is twice the size
yeah, what's it cost to put a line in?, its about a hundred pound now
you see, if you put a line it costs you about a hundred a thirty quid now I think, but according to what they tell me, once a line  has been in for a year  if you put a line in, you've got to pay the first year, its gotta be in for a year, if you have it taken out before the year, you'll still be due for the rental on it
mm
as far as I can gather, I don't know, I'd imagine where a line has a minimum period of three months rental
mm
right, and another thing is  whether we want phone's, because all these phone's are rented  the actual phone's
yeah
right, they haven't nee got spare four phone's 
yeah 
you can pick up phone's that cheap these days, probably for about fifteen quid for er, have a decent phone
yeah,
right and there why, why, I mean I'm not saying, at the end of the day its all taxed up towards you making money
mm
now ideally what I'd like to do is to have a chat with somebody, a
cos we could do with these phones, of like, I don't know yet, exactly how it works, but, but the one you've got the headphones on
that's right, that'll be a much better system to work
mm
but I don't think Telecom's up to dating things, Telecom keeps rabbitting on about how clever they are at doing this 
mm 
that and the next thing and that 
and Mercury's no nearer
Mercury's no nearer see
mm
erm, quite frankly I'm looking to have something like probably a, that's twelve, sixteen phones working this thing next year 
mm
there's no any reason why you shouldn't eh?
you work out how much business you'll be doing with sixteen phones
oh yeah, I know what your saying Bob
I mean were working with five at the minute, we'll go to that place and double it up to say ten  and by this time next, next year there's not any reason why it shouldn't be more to sixteen
mm 
and also
I'll just go and check this is
alright?
go on then
Ah I don't know whether you want me to chat on about that
Yeah talk to it about, in general terms
Right  that depends on how general you're talking about, does er, eh  so that gives you an idea there, when I was working with them
Mm
here are my targets for the period, right?
Mm
And that's percentages and everything
Can I have a look?
Aye have a look, while you're doing that I'll have a look at what bits and pieces  see if I talk to you for a minute about these
right
Mm
somebody's going to have to spend a bit of time with them over the week about the  presume I'm gonna have the time
That's right, it's
and it might be better for me to do it, see you've got a
 

there's various things you can talk to them about, and all you do is, all you're looking for is some key words to motivate them, right  eh  er to a certain extent you want, you want to assume from the start that they don't have a clue what they're doing
Mm
right, now, I mean that's the basis that I start with June  excuse me, now that's the basis you said didn't we?
Everybody that starts
Everybody, now you've also got to accept the high percentage of having nay got a clue, eh what they're doing, even after a week or a couple of weeks and it shouldn't er be here, but if you get somebody, nice er Michelle or Cathy, eh, or  eh Adel
Yeah
now they can only push you, they can use a certain amount of their own imagination, right, but they cannot really push your information unless it's been fed to them, so somebody's, somebody's got it, do you follow me?
Go and lay it in there
Mm
because at the end of the day other who come in and start are gonna listen and see what they do
That's right
so the more strength you've got in it, that, that you
basically, eh, the more, you know, the better the result you're going to get  now I think it's, no I don't think so  so you're gonna have to concentrate on, on the actual
Selling
selling and getting a result on that  you see I've covered a lot of stuff for you on that, I've covered quite a bit with you on, er product knowledge, now would you say that you're reasonably together there and where you want to be on product knowledge?
Not too bad, yeah
Right, so I mean obviously if there's anything that comes up as you go along  I've gotta be able to  you know you and I, I'll just chat it through, but when it comes to things like er  me talk to you, sales talk to you for instance about a comparative question, you wouldn't know what I was talking about would you?
No
Cos I've never
I've never covered things like comparative questions, when I talk to you about close and, you know basically what I'm talking to you about
Mm
cos you know roughly what close are about and you know how to close, but that, let's imagine for the sake of the discussion, that there's a hundred different ways of closing, right, and if there's a hundred different ways of close closing there's bound to be thousands of variations on each close, you see what I'm saying to you?
Mm
so there's a lot of scope, by, in other words, if you take a multiple, if you did, if you know four closes and you only use two, you might get away with it
Mm
if you know eight and you use four, again you're talking numbers see
Mm
everything basically comes down to numbers, er  see, when I was talking to you earlier about  about canvassing, right, I said basically you work on key words  right now you don't need  you, one, one of the things that I talked to you about canvassing is that if you notice the difference between a good canvass and a bad canvass, at least we didn't in fact activity sort of work to do in it, now if you take a, take a activ activity as being, being a key word and you discuss activity with them, right, you can then look at, at activity right as a variation on activity as there is on to action, right, now sit and do my script and talking to a customer, right, and mouthing and mouthing and mouthing and mouthing and saying your bit to a customer, you've got to sound like a parrot, now I know the way you canvass, the centre of action between you and the cu and the punter, do you see what I mean?
Yeah
Right, now a lot of them don't interact with the customer, a lot of them don't even let the customer to think that the customer's not allowed to, they're frightened in case their customer opens their mouth and says no
Mm
right, this is exactly the same we're selling isn't it?
It's a case of interacting with a, with a
That's right, yeah
Right, now if you don't interact right  you're not gonna get a result and if the customer does not interact with you, then you're not gonna get a result, right, now if you assume that as you're working your way through that appointment that your enthusiasm is passing across to the customer or anybody else who is in the room, right, right, but through that interaction right you're working towards a result, now if you go and come out of that office, about his, with a result, you'll know  you'll know what you're getting next week or next month you gotta I mean the customer's gotta be at the
well I know that, yeah
there and then, now if we're talking about closing for a minute, right 
 

let me make you one up to objections, I'm not prepared to give you a decision tonight, what would you say to them on that?
Come on just go
just to for a minute 
I dunno you, yeah , you just sort of gotta say ob obviously you want to think about it, obviously it's, you know it's a lot of money, you know, but are you happy with the window, is it, you know, is it the sort of style of the win , you know, is it the sort of style of the window, we, we, I dunno, we agreed on this sort of style, is it the, you know, the sort of style that goes, goes with it, go through sort of one or two what and find out what, what it is they really want to think about 
Right , well let's just think for a minute exactly what you just said, can you repeat to me roughly what you've just said?
Yeah find out, I mean exactly sort of trying to find out exactly what it is that they want to think about, suggest, you know
Mm
suggest that you've got another appointment in the area
Mm
suggest that you'd like to think about it, suggest that you would pop back within an hour, two hours
Right, but let's say that you're not prepared to pop back, let's say that you're sitting there and you've got from that point, you want, you no want to go to the house, right, now you're not  you're not gonna treat as a twenty minute call back, let's kill that for a minute
Mm
right, now there is a precise and an exact way of working your way through it, right  so maybe while use my words right, they might not be the same as yours but they will be roughly what you said a minute ago, right, what was your words, some of it?
Yeah, I've been trying to find out what 
Obviously obviously
yeah
In other words you agree with the customer, right, now take my words, you wanna think it over, right, we're not prepared to give you a decision tonight, eh, now I'd say something like,well that's understandable, and we've gone through as many things and debt this evening as we probably need to go through, don't you agree?
Or words to that effect, right, and I realize that you have to think, think carefully in order to make the right choice, because it's gotta be right for you and it's also gotta be right for the property, alright?
But just er, you know, clarify my thinking on it, what exactly is it that you feel you want to think about?
The money 
Well, give me a bit of space for it
Mm, alright
just exactly what it is you want to think about
mm, mm
right, cos they'll not likely to say the money, they'll just sit and look at you, right, and anyway you wanna find out exactly what their problem is, so before they even get the chance to say the money, you say to them, just erm, you know, just er make it clear to me what is it that you want to think about, is it the design of the windows?
Is it the colour of the windows?
Is it the cost?
Is it this, is it that, is it the next thing and that's where you want to get them, cos they'll tell you what it is and you've got to, is it them, what is it?
Is it this, is it that, is it the next thing until they're prepared to tell you what it is, that's the way you ask them, cos they'll no volunteer what it is, cos what you're looking for is a final objection for them, right  now you say oh that's a load of rubbish that does nay what, but how can you sit and study that and you learn how to use it customers, right, on the objection which is the hardest objection for any sales person to deal with, you know yourself
Mm
that is the hardest objection you can get, right, we're not prepared to give you the decision on the night, I wanna think it over, it's the same objection, right
Mm
well that's quite understandable and we're talking here about four thousand pounds, it's a lot of money to anybody isn't it?
Right, but we have covered most things that's ev , I don't know if I've actually missed anything out, right  but just to clarify my thinking what is it you do actually want to think about, is it the  the colour, is it what glass you want in the bathroom?
Is it the choice of handles?
Right, and you get them to something that you can deal with, because the one thing you cannot deal with right, we want to think it over, it isn't matter where you take them to, right  whether it's the bathroom window, whether it's the one in
do you see what I mean?
Mm
All you're doing is taking them from the objection, which is, well, we're not prepared to give a decision, take them from that objection to where you want them  do it with me, can you do it?
Yes
Go on, have a go  alright, right I understand exactly what you're saying Pauline, right the only thing is  the wife and I have thought about it and we're just not prepared to, you know what I mean, we're gonna have to take a couple of days, because we wanna think it over
Mm, yeah, I can't do it with you I'm sorry, I can't use it with you, I get the general, what you mean that is it, you know is it
with the style 
I got your stock see , I've got your stock, you're either gonna shut your case or you're going to the, you're going to go to the house or you're going have to move me from that objection that I've hit you with, then the objection that you're comfortable with, now that's what closes are about, it's dancing people from one objection to another, let me put you on another objection then, seeing as you're not too happy with that then
No I get, what I
you understand the process?
Yeah, yeah
Take people to objections, take them to where you want them to be and bear in mind you're always looking for an objection
Yeah
right, another thing, we wanna get more quotes, right
Mm
you're the first person we've seen, right, how you gonna deal with that?
Well obviously want, you know, the best possible price and that, you know, want the best quality windows for us erm 
Yeah go on
if you haven't already shown them a window
Alright
go on, you know go on and tell them the strengths of the window
Alright, okay
and er obviously I want to sort of give you the best possible price
Yeah
so, you, if you, we can even sort of go through your figures and hopefully make the price that we, you know, we show better or
Yeah, I like that
and we er sort of use you know key members in the area that we've done work for
Okay
erm and how we do compare to other companies erm 
Mm
I'm not very good at sitting doing this face to face but 
Right , but what I'm trying to say is that you can dance them to them and by the way when are you thinking of having it done
Mm
right  cos then you're taking them away from the fact that you want other quotes right, they'll say to you oh we weren't thinking of doing it actually until the winter, right and then you can say to them well let me just say that by placing your order in now we can put your installation in hand, right, basically at today's prices, right, on an extended delivery, right, and you can still qualify for a special offer, right 
Mm 
and that means that we can sub you via sub
measures than others in the area, right, and instal it before the weather gets too cold, and the price that's on the contract will be the total amount you have to pay  or something like that
Mm
Right, now I'm trying to say to you is, that if, if you write, you write all these things down, you'll find that one thing won't react with another, you know we were talking about interacting
Mm
right, you'll gather a bit of string, I'm not saying you'll use the words I'm using, but the theme, do you see the theme that I'm talking about, about moving people and
Yeah
dancing them a wee bit more, the more knowledge you've got
Yeah
the more you can take them to where you want them, do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Yeah , I mean I, I did 
Er, you there's no offend that I can cover with you, I'm just having a wee chat with you on it in general terms on it, but I mean I could fill pages and pages 
I'm not , I do it
on bits and pieces
I mean I do it sort of a bit naturally, I mean if you, you know that what, the Delvine Hotel, I mean I sort of went in and I dunno sort of part way in I sort of said can I ask you if, you know, you've had your other quotes and he sort of said yes we're gonna sit down tonight and make our minds up
That's right
er and I sort of, I thought well you know, I mean, I sort of went of that erm and I, I showed him a window, showed him a corner section erm, I didn't ask, I said I can't remember if your wife sort of erm, if your sister said it was the gold or the white handles
Mm
er and obviously the bathroom and that I, I did it in me own sort of way 
That's right I know, but see this is, you see this is the point I'm trying to make to you, you can quite happily do it in your own way, but the problem is you don't know what you're doing, right, and, and if you actually knew what you were doing and well aware of what you're doing you would do it a hundred times better and you would do it all the time, right
Mm
I mean basically you say the bloke says we're going to sit down and make a decision tonight
Mm
you can accept that couldn't you?
Just the same as you can accept the fact that somebody says to you that I cannot really afford your windows, right, just the same as when you first speak to them on the phone, you can say oh sorry, sorry to bother you and put the phone down because it said you
in the first place, but if that's his final objection, the fact that he's gonna make a decision tonight  somebody that's really good at their job that was in there would sell that deal then, they wouldn't wait till tonight
That's what I did, didn't I?
That's what I'm saying, right, now, what I'm saying is there's a, that, that, is, there's, there's, there's, there's things, there's things, there's guides to be able to do that, right, and the guide is there's certain things you do and certain things you don't do, because what you do basically is that you close him on his final objection which is what you're just saying you did, right, but you close him on his final objection, how did you manage to close him on his final objection?
Because you listened to what he was saying to you, now you might not believe it but the number of people that don't listen to what customers are saying to them, you follow me?
They're half listening and they're half thinking about what they're gonna say
Mm
and none of you are, don't know what I'm saying to you right 
Yeah fair enough
so you close him on his final objection, you listen, you then sell him his objection, right, you sell him his objection, right, you confirm his answer, right, whatever he says to you and his answer you actually confirm it back to him, you don't interrupt him, right, you don't guess where he's at, right  and basically if work through a system you'll get on there, now for me to be able to, to, to, what I've just said to you is a load of garbage, but if I was sitting I was sitting actually go through each one of these steps and that's what you term as a closing sequence, you see what I mean?
There is a closing sequence  now the reason that you were able to close in the manner that you did with that bloke is a natural ability, but if I've said to you to teach somebody else it  you would say I cannot do it, but I can't teach somebody else, because you're not actually aware of the sequence that you're working, can you see what I'm saying to you?
Yeah
Now that comes back to the question is, are salesman born or are they made?
Right  were you born a sales person?
No, but I think you're moulded, but you have obviously 
That's right 
intelligent a certain amount of intuition and  
Aye, but you could of quite happily of gone through your life if you hadn't of seen that advert with the sell any
Mm
and had you of gone to the wrong company, right
I would of been put right off it straight away in my life 
That's right  see  we've talked, we've spoken about all the form closes before in the past, we've spoken about a  sumter closes, I mean you know what I mean by a  sumter close, don't you?
Whereby you're sitting with a customer and you've assumed that he's bought
Yeah, what I'm, what I'm a bit erm
I mean I'm just having a general chat with you
Yeah
and everything, cos some people I'm gonna have to go through the whole 
What I feel like that 
lot one by one, mm
What I feel I do I do lack is I think I, I, I sort of communicate well with the, with the people, I think I cover the window and stones 
Right 
I think I cover all that very well
Right
but I'm, I'm a bit weak on 
What direction to go on, on their closes?
Yeah, I mean 
Alright let me ask you something then, off the top of your head how many closes could you put a name to?
Well I don't know you know what the name we've used 
Come on then how many, er just
I dunno there's sort of an order form for closing them 
You've got an order, try and, try and, what you should do is, you see some time we should sit and list them, right, you know you've got an order form closed
call back, right, they're going to the toilet want it closed
Yeah
right, what other closes can you think on?
Well I don't know the proper name for them, but I mean it's
Well I'll tell you one or two then, right 
Mm 
you've got an order form closed, right  you've got a  sumter closed, where you assume that the customer's buying cos he's been giving you buying signals, you're hoping 
Yeah 
he's been getting the buying signals right, you can close them on alternative choice, right, which do you prefer?
Right, do you prefer the slim line?
Do you prefer to put, do you, do you prefer the narrow gap or the wider gap?
Right and he says the wider gap, so you write it on the order form, right, it's part of the order form close
Mm
right, what vent depths do you want?
If we say, say twenty five percent, right mind you, you know these that most people have about a third to two thirds right
Mm
if he says a third, write it on the order form, do you see what I mean the order form closing?
Yeah probably laugh at me 
Pardon?
probably laugh a bit at that
well I mean I'm only trying to get you to pick to pick it up one wee thing from every time I said, do have a chat with you, that's what we always say, I'm not expecting you to pick up anything else I've said to you tonight cos I'm only talking to you in general terms, but if you pick up one wee thing, right, story close
Mm
you can close on a story, now you're bound to tell stories Pauline 
Yeah, ha , I, I, I do yeah 
I'm just trying to make you aware of what you're dealing when you're out there with the people's
Yeah
You see what I'm saying to you?
Yeah
Right
I mean I do that with a, you know when I'm sort of on about a long delivery talk about 
That's right 
that you know he's a retired gentleman 
Alright 
basically and they budget towards it
I see
and that sort of thing
Now I've not given you a lot of chance to speak because you said you don't want to go and to, but I want 
Yeah 
to cover a wee bit of ground here, I'm just trying to make a point to you about how many closes you're probably not aware for the minute, these are only a few of them, right, similar situation close, right, lost sale close, right  the didn't I cover that close
What do you mean by lost sale close?
Well I'll be, I'm not going to go into it, that's a close on itself, just like the first one that I, everyone has got a sequence
Mm
you follow me?
But they're all, they're all a variation on a theme, but if you, you know what I mean, if you've got the closes in your head you can press buttons
Mm
you follow me, now when I say to you story book stay, eh er, I say your story close, right away you said I've done that
Mm
you know what I mean, if I say a similar situation close, right
Mm
you'll probably say well that is doesn't er quite ring a bell, because you've never used it and you cannot use it until I tell you what it is
Mm
do you see what I mean, right, sit and re-question close, right   you can close them on ee do you want to include the extra window for two hundred pound, you follow me you've hit them with a price you want to close them, right and you sit and do the paperwork and you just say to them do you want me to include the extra window for two hundred pounds because you've already said to them you, you give an extra, do you follow me?
You've set them up
Mm
right with an extra window, whatever about the money, like Mrs what's her name, so you've nearly closed her on the conservatory  you do all the paper, your order close form on the conservatory and you say to her, right, cos you're working your sums out, do you want me to include the extra window for two hundred pounds?
Mm
If she says yes, she's bought
Mm
do you see, do you understand the basis on what you're saying on that then?
Yeah
These things we need to go in, right
I mean I did that, I mean it, it, er, er, at Exmouth when they all measured er, they had an extra window like and I sort of you know, do you want, you know
If somebody says you don't wanna be rushed, right, that's what you've gotta say to them  that's just what that old dear was saying the other day, right  you certainly understand that, right, you agree with them, first thing you do you always agree with them, right  and then you've just got the same sequence as I want to think about it, but just sort of make it clear, I mean what is it they actually, you know, frightened of being rushed into?
Mm 
I mean when the order form is closing, you're closing things like, do you want white handles?
You follow me, ask them right then, I'm trying to get your head on er, on, on er how the form close see
Mm
without actually dealing with as and an order close, if I can I'll cover the multitude of things, right  Now what would you say if somebody said I wanna look at aluminium windows
I want to what?
I want to look at your aluminium windows, let's say we didn't do them  right 
Tell me what you would say
I don't know, I'm not, my head's not on it, anyway that's the kind of things that
mm  good, I mean that's not so appropriate these days life is it, cos P V C proved itself a bit more hasn't it?
Aye, right I don't know if you  if you feel that the wee chat we've had is any good but, because we don't want to chat along too long
Mm
but I'm trying to make you aware of the fact that at some stage we should be looking long and hard at closing, right  we'd ask the questions, you're quite good at asking questions, some sale field don't ask question, don't ask questions, right  see you want to have a
as well when you're talking
to say something they believe in, right  do you like my window?
Yes  do you follow me, was that sort of
do you follow me?
Mm
The main questions you ask, the more he'll believe, he don't ask, it's, it's, it's all about, this is what I'm saying about erm reacting, eh  when basically what you would is you'd make a statement, tell him something and then ask him a question, which is what you did anyway, but I don't know if you're always aware of what you're doing, you're doing, you do it naturally, selling is about making statements and then asking questions, you do it when you telephone customers all the time 
Mm
right, but we've never covered all this see, you've picked bits up as you've gone along  and another thing you should never give a choice of something and nothing  you should always give a choice of something and something else
Oh yeah, but then you've also got to watch I mean that I'd, sometimes I'd muck things up when I've given too much choice I think
Well that's like saying you want to lower your counters or shall we employ tall, tall girls
It's like what?
saying  shall we lower your counters
Or 
or shall we employ tall girls, you follow me?
What you say basically to somebody is, right, what do you want them this height or that height?
Mm
Do, do you follow in?
Mm
Do you know what I'm saying to you?
No
Ha 
Alright, let's, let's, I mean when you're, when you're
a good choice for instance, right, all you say to somebody is do you prefer the traditional right  or would you prefer the modern styles, right in other words would you like Georgian or would you rather have leaded
Yeah
do you follow me?
That's an alternative choice, perhaps somebody says oh I preferred the leaded that's a buying signal
Yeah
do you see what I mean, all these things, do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Mm
You've nearly of done it
Yeah
you know what glass do you want?
You've, you've closed on, on patterns of glass
Yeah I do that a lot for the bathroom
That's right so you can do it on leaded light, you can do it on handles, but either you lay it on the customer right, which do you prefer?
I've heard you saying it, which do you prefer, right, but you're aware of what you're doing
Mm
that's a closing question, which do you prefer?
Mm
Right  now all these things which you've been saying are all written down
Yeah
you follow me?
You're not the first person that have ever thought of it though, that's what I'm trying to say to you
You see I mean I can see the goal there every day, I can see, I can see me sort of getting to the goal, I just maybe sort of go  around it, I mean well a bit I mean, since I've had these two I sort of said, you know, would it, would it be the white handle, let me show you, you know the gold handle and, you know 
Fine er what we're, what we're saying to you basically is, right, and, and another thing you're doing is proving that you're capable of doing it, now if I was training you from cold, right, and you hadn't done it
Mm
and I didn't know whether you were capable of doing it, I would make you, tell you had what to do
Mm
but because I know you can do it I can say you another one to one conversation with you about it, but basically you're no way near to guide the customer  you're in there to sell the customer
Mm
right, and what you say is, as for the, you've got to stack you on er and when you're talking to them, right, you've got to use these words, that's what I was saying to you earlier, what do you prefer?
Which do you prefer?
How?
If?
How many?
Right  who's usually be cleaning the windows, right, who would usually be cleaning the windows?
Right  do you like?
Right, do you like net curtains behind your windows?
Do you like venetian blinds?
Are you following me?
You get, if you wanted to go in it really in depth
Mm
you can write down these words, that would then be given you a clue things that you could be saying to your customers, where, right, if you start thinking about the job that you're doing and I give you the word where, right  you think of the number of times you can use the word where, with a customer, right
Mm 
where would you put the
right, where would you want to put the wooden fence?
Do you know what I mean?
Lead words, if you want to sit down and, in, in general you see er, you want to just sit down and think about what you're doing and what you're not doing, you can sit down and exercise on these words, now I'm not saying you'd ever want to do that, right  now if, now you know I was saying to you about comparative questions right 
Mm 
was it comparative I was talking to you about?
I was talking about comparative, where some er situations and all this, that and the next thing, right, I mean one that, quite a, quite a useful phrase what you say is, isn't that true that, no you might not like that phrase, right, but you can take phrases like that and you can think to yourself can I, can I, right.
Tied in questions, they, they usually ask, you know I went on to you on, on about tied ins, right, didn't you, hasn't it, wouldn't you, right, wouldn't you prefer, wouldn't you rather, right, if you could wouldn't you.
Now these are all tied in lines
Mm
right, now if you want to understand how to tie down, you just need to look at one or two tied in lines, and then you can, you can add, oh you can add your main lines  what I'm trying to say is, when it comes to, when it comes to, when it comes to, when it comes to selling, there's a lot more than just what might you've got, right, see I mean, I see for instance, you've probably, you probably don't, you probably don't, you probably don't go along right quite often right, people will buy what products can do with them, they don't buy the products, are you with me?
So you've gotta sell benefits  you've gotta know what the product can do for them, right  you've got to find out what they want from it  I mean it might be security that's the big problem
Mm
you know that yourself, it might be maintenance
It might be condensation
It might be condensation, right, now you're aware of these things, cos if you're really working professionally, your head's supposed to be running all across this stuff while you're in there, in there with the punters
Mm
you follow me?
If you're really into it, right, find out what your customer wants done  always guard against talking too much
Mm
listen, right  apath empathy is the word, you know what empathy is?
Relating, you form a, a bond basically between you and the customer, that's why you sell well, cos you gel well with your customers, there's empathy there, you've got to come across as caring and sharing, but you've gotta ask questions and you listen to the answers, right, you've got to basically treat their problems as if they were your own, do you know what I'm saying to you?
Right and you've got to sell benefits.
Let me give you an example of how you sell the benefits  one and only one thing  the handle, you've got that handle, that system
you'll love that benefit
Mm
right, you love that benefit, doesn't matter about anybody else in the country likes that benefit, you are gonna sell them that benefit, but there's other benefits to the system, do you follow me?
Mm
You can actually get stronger as you go along on all the benefits  so instead of selling one benefit, you could sell them a multitude of benefits  because it means that if you're with a customer two hours or two and a half hours, instead of spending ninety percent of the time, chatting along, you, you'll not argue about, you follow me, I've stopped selling benefits, but I used to sell them brillian brilliantly, in other words you get, gives you a bit of meat
Mm
and you know how they say to you at times oh thanks ever so much, I've never heard anybody that would cover a thing in quite so much detail, I mean you don't want to sound like a machine that's pumping out information
Mm
but it's gotta be in your head, you know what I'm saying to you?
Because the more you know about your product, the more you know about the benefits, the more you know eh  you've got to keep an open mind on it, you know that, right  you cannot go out and just sell this ee for me, just one line, bom, bom, bom 
Mm 
bom, bom, right, cos I'm inclined to do that sometimes, right , you know you've got to sow seeds with customers that's where you get your recommends from, right, eh, you know that you put it, show a warmness towards you, you follow me?
Yeah
You know, all these things again I'm working this all purely in key words, you follow me?
I put a word, because it, you follow me, it fits the theme that we're talking about, alright?
See basically if a customer objects, you're about to cover the, the fact that if the customer objects, say come back to canvassing for a minute, you get somebody, you phone somebody up and they say, urgh, urgh, and they just mumble away and they listen to you and they don't listen to you, right, it's a waste of bloody time, but if they talk to you and they give you objections and you deal with these objections, right, they're bound to buy
Mm
do you follow?
It's the people that, that actually, do you follow me?
What width do you use?
What's the distance between the two panes of glass, it's showing an interest doesn't it?
Mm
Right and you should never fight with objections, I think you realize that don't you?
Er if somebody hits you with an objection, you deal with it, you don't fight, you follow me?
You, you then take this and have a wrestling match with that objection  you, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
You understand what I mean by that?
Eh you work it and you move on
Yeah
you follow me?
You deal with it and you move, right 
by the way
there is a big bit out of it.
Mm 
Now a bad habit that I got into, right, a customer will be talking to me and I don't know if you've noticed it, I won't let them finish what they're saying, I'll jump in because I'll know what they're asking me 
Yeah, I've noticed it a wee bit
With me?
Right 
A wee bit I mean
Aye, but I mean I notice it, it's just that I've been doing that job that  longly you see, you follow me?
Now you see, I'm anticipat 
Yeah, anticipate 
Are you with me?
Yeah
Cos when you, when you get to the stage that you're at now basically, that  it's not that difficult be what sort of extra money to find
No
are you with me?
Now I don't wanna, want me to prattle on much more tonight, if it's not worth speaking about, I think it's probably about enough
But do you, oh
What was you going say?
Without sort of looking for some, for a phrase or whatever, I'm more or less, I'm not too bad at erm, well
Er I wonder if you will use any of the things that I've talked to you about tonight?
If only you were aware of we did the other things
Mm
right  I mean what would you for instance think if it's possible, if I can prove that  right
Mm
sixty percent of customers buy first through re recommendations, for instance, right, if I can prove to you that sixty percent of customers buy, buy first through recommendations, right, would you not see that as a kind er reason why you should buy first as well ?
Right
Mm, but it's impossible to prove that is
No it's not, I can sit there with a customer list and I could tell you who recommended who
Yeah, well you possibly can, I couldn't
Try, I could, I would never say that to customers, that's a load of shit see, but the point is you, you
you get some folk come away 
Can you turn the T V down a fraction sweetheart?
See basically what you're talking about is, you know when you close somebody, and I've got to come on to this, because this is the, this is the key to selling deals.
When you close  you been hearing me say this to you when we first started, I'm sure that you, you know, you're aware of it now, you should be, what did I say to you once you've closed somebody?
Let's say you had somebody with a price
now this should apply every time you hit somebody with a price, every time no matter where you are
Is the total amount payable?
Alright, alright, the total amount payable, but there's only five thousand, six hundred and fifty four pound
That's the total price including VAT
The total price including VAT, what do you say next?
price that goes onto it, on
No you shouldn't say anything
Oh
yeah and, and, open date it
Yeah I am aware of that style actually because I'd sent my brother a
oh we've all got to be a little wary a wee bit
Yeah
you should be wary of every appointment
Yeah, I do, I am actually, I mean, I'm not saying I'm a hundred percent
Oh well you should be
but, yeah, well I am
 
but I tell you if you ever get to the stage where you are, are a hundred percent that'll close deals, that's your best close of the lot
Mm
really is, there is no beli , you've seen, you've seen it with me have 
And you get, you get the object you get their objection then
Oh, aye you'll get it
you know if you
 
silence is the most powerful weapon you've got
Mm 
and verbal diarrhoea is the worse
Yeah 
that you can possible indulge in 
I do do that because it gets a bit uncomfortable sometimes, you know 
You see, you know I was talking to you earlier about, about  punchlines basically, but I can't remember the words I was using for it, times like by the way, right  right, or did you know  or did I mention to you  do you follow me, a lot of key lines that you can think on that you use
Mm
right, now if you can increase your number of closes  that you know them and you're capable of using, and if you can increase your number of key lines that you, do you follow me
Mm
in other words if you can improve your strength
Yeah
what chance has the punters got?
Mm
Right, cos, it's like everything, it's like your weight  it either goes up and up and up or it goes down and down and down, you'll never hold it the same
Mm
so if you try and work with the same amount of closes all the time, you'll end up getting weak in one or two
Yeah
you know what I mean?
And you'll end up maybe only using one or two and you should be using ten, and you must go in a silence trap, that is so, so important
Mm  you don't always use it though
Used to though
Yeah
last ones were a bit 
as it used to be, I mean I really, I get away with things, do you follow me?
But I don't wanna encourage you with it, do you follow me?
Yeah, I'm going upstairs
Right I'm going through here  some of these, some of these
Mummy
Yeah, what?
So you're thinking of washing her then are you?
Yeah, the only trouble is if I take students, they want to do their washing
use the washing machine

Got up this morning she said can I have a pie?

She's had a big cake

do you want one?
anything like that
No, not one of them
Don't you like them?

I don't like them, there, I want a different biscuit
I've not got any other kind, that's all I've got
Different one
You want one?
There's no different ones , that's the only one
That's all I've got

Don't want it 
Don't want it alright

You open it 
I don't know if he's got an imaginary friend 
you open it 
Mm, mm 
open it
Who was in the house yesterday then?
Tell granddad who was in the house yesterday morning when we woke up  can you remember?

Anthony's got the flu did you know?
Who?
Anthony
When?
said he was off yesterday cos he had the flu
Mm, cos he wasn't very well last week
Wasn't he?
but he seemed alright at the weekend, he was decorating at the weekend
Yeah, she said he wasn't well
so I take it he must of gone down with the flu after that then
Yeah 
So when did you see him?
No I was talking to Julie yesterday, she phoned me up at the 
Mm 
surgery
Is she working this week?
she's supposed to be having David next week for me
Mm
when this, when I do this course
Mm
which is gonna be wonderful
What is that a one day course?
Yeah, well, no it's a one day course then I've got four and a half things af , you know follow on
Mm
things after it
Mm
one a month or once every fortnight
Mm
and then I take it all erm, I start doing them regularly, I think it's probably a tax  you know some for the tax that they did, spend a lot of money
So the government haven't got to find that bit rather than them being 
Yeah probably , probably
Mm
so, it's called involving everyone, so everybody's got to go
Mm
half past seven in the morning
I was sitting here yesterday 
till half past five at night 
I was sitting here yesterday mor day before, and that bloody picture snapped the catch, the catch on it, broken it and it just dropped straight down
Did it, did it break?
It had quite a strong catch on it by the look of it 
Well that's not very strong though
Well you wouldn't of thought it would just suddenly of snapped would you?
Didn't break though, you're alright
No it didn't break, but it means 
It's unlucky if they break
I've got to rig something else up on the back and I've got to hang it up
Otherwise it means there's a great big white patch on the wall 
Mm
Mm.
Desmond were doing
mm, mm
at the weekend, cutting through four wires or, quite a bit of
how are they?
Are they alright?
I think they're okay
I see that Linda's still down here
But Annie's not
I've never seen her for years
What about Linda is she still about?
She's at Torquay 
for years and years 
little loud Linda
Here mum 
Yeah she was a bit mouthy wasn't she?
Yeah 
and that, these bits of paper you had as well, where are they?
They're in my cup
mum
Wait a minute then 
So Paul is having a week dozing really, he's not doing much work this week
Well no, seems to be quite, I was busy yesterday and, and it seemed to be a really busy week, but a couple of appointments fell down, but I've got quite a busy night tonight.
And what are you doing?
Me, I'm dozing even better than him
He's a chief dozer  
Are you 
Aye, well, we've got a lot of new people starting this week
Your trousers are getting a bit short are they not?
No they've always been a bit short
Somebody I, ones that I give him that I thought he
Oh
thought it was a bit short, ha
No, I've got ee, I've got various pairs at various lengths
Yeah
and I think the fact that the stomach is getting fatter 
Is that your trousers short?
I think it's the stomach that's fatter pulls them up a bit.
Yeah, it could be.
But I'm going on a diet
I'm on a diet this week
I'm not quite sure when I'm going on mine that's the problem
Mine happened yesterday
Did it?
I'm starving
Is that why your back's bad?
No, it's 
Is it psycho psychosomatic is that the word?
I think it's the walking that did it, I don't know
Mm
but, but sort of sudden movement of the body after 
Aye 
not using it for some
you should, you should need some indulgence from this exercise it's exertion, it's so awful
No I count up to ten, I keep getting up in the middle of the night to weigh myself
Mm
which means I'm getting a bit paranoid doesn't it?
Mm, mm
I've got some electronic scales upstairs they're wha 
 
they're really accurate
Mm
go on then I'll have a go, but nobody's allowed to look
No you won't
Yeah, no, they're in his, well they're in his room still, he's hiding them because
I'm hiding
I've had a weigh in once, I've lost about five pounds
Good
but I'm getting a bit fed up with it this week
Oh you cannot get on the chair with your boots you
get off with your boots 
but you'll not get enthusiastic about it, and this is the important thing 
Well I'm sticking pretty much to it
I don't, I don't think dieting is the main thing, it's just cutting down and getting more exercise
Mm
it's not the only thing 
No, she's on one of these where you can you can eat a lot of good food 
It's the one that Shelly went on 
it does work
you see I go on fruit and that for a day and all I do the next day is get a terrible cramp in the stomach
Mm
and then want to eat a lot, so it's like, it's like acidy 
That's definitely psychosomatic with you then
Your what?
acidy, you not feel so acidy, it's like
Aye
or windy or  which, not good for anybody
Mm 
but this diet is the one that Shelly, she lost quite a lot and Jill went on it for quite a while
Mm
and she lost a stone too, it's really 
The only trouble is, it's when the, I think the dieting, it's alright the dieting, but it's when you stop the dieting 
That's right, yeah 
you just think oh I've not had that for ages, I've not had 
You've got to develop, you've got to develop a decent eating habit 
I'm just frightened you're gonna pig out
No
As, as 
No that's all it is
It's losing that and then
Mm
keeping to the habit
Yeah
Yeah
What happens is folk, folk treat it as a diet and then when they stop the diet, they stop the habit
Mm
Yeah
You see I'm quite 
You follow me you were to keep it up as a habit and keep to the habit
You see I'm quite good in the summer, if I get up and have a proper breakfast, like cereals and toast
Mm
and fresh orange or something
Mm
and then stuff like soup or
Mm
sandwich you know, sort of sandwich for dinner, something
Mm
sort of proper then I just have my tea, it's more the picking and eating sweets in between 
In between like yeah 
But everybody overeats, but most people, I mean they're, if you look at the rubbish that we, that we push into ourselves that we shouldn't push in and that's the bit that causes the damages
That's right
Yeah
I mean I, I'll today I'll have ice cream
but mine's lack of exercise at the minute because everything's going loose 
I've had je 
I'll have jelly
Will you?
Jelly's not fattening though
I'll have Bounty
jelly's only water 
will I have Bounty?
I'll probably have crisps and we go and bulk buy the crisps we'll get big packs
Will you?
and what else will we have?
You see that doesn't appeal to me, I'm a sort of meat pie and potato
Oh a meat pie and potato person are you?
Yeah, steak and kidney pies I could eat
mm, quite
and eat it, and you had a cream cake 
 
when you was up the town did you?
No he had a cake, I didn't have a cake
What did you say to me on he phone when I was talking to Tracey?
I said tell them not to bring too many cakes  
 
oh I did think about bringing something up and I thought well, I'm not having any so nobody else is
er, I've had a bowl of Rice Crispies today
Mm, mm
with semi-skimmed milk  that's it, then I'll have my lunch lunchtime and have my tea teatime
Mm, mm
He, he sat here this morning he said all serious he said I'm cutting out potatoes, bread, biscuits and all sweet things, so I you know, I just said, well if you know if you are love, do you want me to sort of start, you know, obviously not cooking you potatoes and whatever, well what we'll see in a, probably in about two month's like,you know 
But you need, erm especially a man you need to have the
Of course you do
you need to have those like those
 
and Mars Bars and Mars Bars 
No you don't need to have Mars Bars
and ice cream 
you need to have bread and potatoes
and treacle and Viennettas 
rather than all these sweet things that you eat
Mm
Just to eat proper meals, minimum, like the minimum you can 
Ah, but I'm not into that, I'm into, I'm into all the all the bits 
Well then 
and pieces the same that's the trouble innit?
Dave's the same , but Dave can eat like six or seven bars of chocolate a day and get away with it 
But Dave's at the age where he can work it off
No, but he's starting not to
No, but he does the
Mm, he's quite slim though really though isn't he?
Yeah he is he has put on about a stone since he's stopped smoking though
Mm  what does he wear at work?
Blue trousers and a blue top
I've got pairs of trousers up there you know
No it's work trousers, it's only, they have to provide them
Oh so I mean, that he, that he doesn't wear other trousers and
No, he's got to wear erm 
No it's just that I've got a lot of trousers up there that are far too big for me now that might fit him 
Get out David 
that might of fitted him
Far too small you mean
Far too small 
Far too small 
yeah
I mean I've got one pair that's really small for me, really, really small
Yeah
they're quite a nice pair actually 
They are actually like, yeah, they're sort of like
He's a thirty two
What, what, what what 
They're 
ones are you talking about?
Them sort of like sandy coloured ones
No I wasn't talking about them
Ah
but I have got them as well 
David will you get out please 
Alright
now 
I mean you could get is, would he wear them if they were half decent 
now 
nick?
I don't know, probably not, I mean he doesn't wear his, I mean like proper trousers
Mm
I just put away 
no, he's hard to get him into his suit trousers
Mm  they're not suit trousers they're
Yeah, I don't know he's 
I wear them with jumpers and things
He doesn't go anywhere dad
Doesn't he?
just goes to work  and comes home  
Well there you are then 
He goes out for about an hour on a Saturday if I, if he's forced  out I said, out  oh  get out please  yeah they're not the ideal things that they should be wearing, but, like because the 
What for work?
Yeah, cos they're not made, they're made of
Are they thin?
Reasonably, but they've, they've got to wear them and they're not allowed to wear T-shi T-shirts with no sleeves on and, certain rules and regulations for
Mm, mm

Get out before
He's stuck

I've got to decide what I'm going to do 
I'm stuck 
with that
I'm stuck 
he's bound to be coming in and wanting to be starting that job 
it's stuck 
What's stuck?
what's stuck?
I should really take him into that
Your foot's stuck?
office place and give him a bag of plaster and tell him to plaster there for a day  either that or send him up to 
When you gonna start Morgan's?
Now you get out and stop going 
A couple of weeks three weeks, I want to get that space on that yet
Right as long as you
do what you want, but
I'm gonna phone them, I'm going up there with Joey to have a look at it
And I shall also, I'd still cook then I shall also  
Stop climbing about, go on the floor and play with your train or your car or something 
Oh, aye, remind me about that tonight then 
Mm, I shall be out tonight 
mm, before you do it though 
What time is it?
Is that er clock, that clock's not working is it?
No  what time is it Bob?
Where's the clock?
Mm?
Twenty five past eleven 
where's the clock? where?
what time 
it's still 
do you go then?
Where?
Probably ten after twelve
Mm
You're still not smoking then Tracey?
Done well ain't you?
Mm
Not at all?
Has Dave stopped at all?
No, he sa , he did, the, happen occasionally went to a neighbour and asked to them to borrow one, he's not started again
Mm, find it difficult when you get to that stage, it's usually when you, once you want 
No that was, that was back a bit 
Was it?
Yeah, he seems to be alright now, he wasn't sleeping at night, I was worse at the beginning you see but he sort of got 
Mm, mm , mm got to come terms with eh?
Yeah 
know that they were two sizes too big for me
No I just thought they looked a bit short that was all  if you were
going this far then the doctor put on it that going  it had on it all that he hates which he takes it means either osteoarthritic
Mm
or overactive, I would think it was probably osteoarthritic
Mm
and constant pain in her right leg
Mm
he said just put down the main
Mm
the main illness
Mm
and that's erm
right
so that's what they did, so
mm, did it, did it ask how much was stretching on her, what she can do and what she couldn't do or
Yeah, he did in a put after
Mm
he just had to like, you know if he 
Wanna get man 
Just to confirm that there was something there basically
That's right
causing the trouble
Yeah
Mm, well it's worthwhile doing that 
what put  
I mean even if they don't get a result on it
Even if they get something that's better than nothing 
Mm, mm 
and I said to them if 
Mm 
they don't get the full amount now they may as well to try again after April because 
Mm 
she most coming in after April
That's right
Mm, they grade you sometimes don't they?
Different grades for
Yeah
different
definitely think they'll get some
Yeah
Look them two women up at Malden and, and, and the bloke came in and they were out on an extra
yeah
Yeah
and you grand much interest she 
 
she's running a bit buying bloody washing machines and carpets and 
Yeah, I mean cos yeah 
you follow me it's all, it's all paying money
Yeah
you get in the habit of spending ex amount, you see
Yeah
and then what else they get on top is the, is a bonus.
Well grandma sort of had it like, when she was like looking after me granddad and whatever like er it's a different sort of kind of, it's the same sort of thing, but you know, something different
Yeah I know what you mean
so if she's sort of er like an attendance allowance or something like that
Yeah, there's two different attendances isn't there?
and once they've got it you see they're not gonna take it away
No, I know
you can't, I mean, it's there for you know 
And then she gets , she gets to something else now, like, she sort of like, looking after herself and whatever
Mm
and she's just turned over eighty odd 
Want to play mum 
but in ninety two 
Ninety two quid for herself
ninety two a week 
 
and she lives like in a warden controlled place the same as your gran and granddad
Yeah
you know and she, you know you don't have to pay much this sort of heating's in or something like that so she's probably got loads of spare money like you, which is good because she's on her own and it gives her more, you know 
I mean there's no point in them, in, in, in them, in them, accepting minimal benefit when they can get maximum benefit is there?
No.
I mean if you look at it that way 
Did I tell you I'm gonna do a course in September?
What you gonna do this time?
I've got erm 
Word processing?
No I don't know what to do 
Writing 
Oh, I've got him in at the play school you see, starts play school after Easter 
Mm, mm 
up at the Technical College
Mm
so I thought while he's up there rather than me walking up and walking back, cos that would be too much exercise
Aye and what money did you get on it?
What?
What money does the government pay you?
I don't think they'll pay me any 
Cos they're always on about credit allowances and this that and therefore
 
I know 
but I'm working
But if you're working, if it's a wh if it's a job that you would enhance your employ, employment prospects
Yeah
surely there's bound to be an employment in credits, does, does telephone not work on an employment credit scheme?
No, they, well this is the trouble you see it's not secure down there
Do they work on in-house training then basically maybe?
Yeah, but you've got to, no they do send some on courses, but they have to select the people and it's done official 
Yeah what to do 
to them
mm, and but if that's part of the scheme you see
What course is it that you're doing then?
Well I'm gonna do the pre-play school one
Mm
cos I've had a, over a year's experience doing it
Mm
doing it
Mm 
Mm 
which is good, I mean you need experience I think 
Mm, mm 
plus if I could get something doing a job like that I'd still have the holidays off, cos I'll need
Mm
I haven't got any cover for him in the holidays
Mm
and that would work around the school holidays
Mm
so that 
And what advantage would that be for you then?
Well it would be something, it would be a bit of paper that say that I can look after children under five, I could go and run a play group or do whatever and earn some money 
Mm, mm 
see instead of doing the one I'm doing and just taking a little bit of money, I could go and start up another one
Mm, mm and then dig  
and make quite a bit of money 
Well that's what you want to do
Mm, mm
Yeah, well that's one
I mean I've got a spare room
and you can have it there
Yeah
but the only thing is that it's up the stairs
Mm, mm
and I don't know that you'll be able to do it in there
Well it's just fire and you have to be but 
Mm 
you can only
because it's upstairs
But you could do a parent and toddlers could you?
Or is there no money in parent and tots?
Erm, you can get a bit of money, but not very much
Mm
but what you need is a one to one to get the child out the building if there's a fire
Mm, mm
What's this mum?
because there is ample space along there 
What's this mum?
Really it'll be ideal along there
And I mean we, we, we could actually encourage folk to come and work with us and, and, and say that there's childminding avail 
Yeah
you follow me, there's a lot of folk that we could employ
Mm
that, that, that, that would be glad to hear, do you follow me?
Yeah
that if there was a facility there
Mm
cos at the minute
Anyway that's, that's on , that's only a three hour course that's running for thirteen weeks, which will cost me forty pounds, but I'll take
I mean if you take the number of people we've had that's had to get babysitters and that
That's right, yeah
or
and things like that, that the, that, the, love a joker or somebody who was
Mm
you know, where they've only got to bring their
Oh I'll take forty pounds of the play group in thirty weeks so that'll cover the cost 
In how long?
In, in thirt , I'll take ten pound a week off them
Mm
off the, no, yeah ten pounds a week 
Er where do you go for this?
The Technical College
And it's a one year course is it?
No it's thirty weeks
Ah, but that's er, that's, sorry, it's a one
mm, Sheila's thinking about doing it with me as well 
Mm
I don't know if she will or not, but I'm going to do it, it's Wednesday morning I could put him in to the, to the creche at the same time
Mm, and what does that enable you to do then?
Takes, allows you to take the children up to five?
Yeah, I'd run a creche erm  help out you know, be part of a, part of a thing or I could set up some my own 
Do your own thing, mm 
Yeah, you can normally only have one person to four children you see
Mm, and what do they normally charge?
It depends, it depends what you're doing with it, see we either we'd put mums and tots which is something, erm
Well whatever you take it's as
somebody that is doing it as a business, what sort of money are they looking to?
I dunno Sheila was 
Pound an hour or something?
Sheila was saying that  the council, the council one is about sixty pound a week 
I don't, ooh, mummy I want to go  
full time, full time
So you could take two hundred and forty quid then 
or about one fifty probably 
so you could take two hundred and forty quid at it?
Probably, but you can't do it full time, you've got to have breaks, you must have an hour break
Mm
for lunch
Mm
but two of you should take two hundred and fifty, I mean some of them part time along with you
You'd have to yeah well you'd have to, to make to erm 
 
mm
I wanna get down
In a minute
Mm
Now
I need to look into it, I'll know better once I've done the course
Aye, what you can do 
I want to get down now 
and what you can't do
But I know from having made this one a successful
Mm, mm
See they've offered me more money to stay at this one cos I've got it running quite well
Mm, mm
Got a treasurer
Mm
that does all the money for me, does all the books
Mm
for nothing
Mm
I've got another girl that does all my buying
Mm
of the toys and that, she goes around all the
and buys decent stuff
Mm
and I'm running it and doing like the  advertising for it
Mm
and what have you
Mm
and safety stuff 
And I mean what's your views, what's your views on what you're doing then?
safety stuff, the only thing is
See, see, I mean if you take a, if you take a, look at it at a point of view of
yeah
you are, eh the basically eh if you were doing your own thing and making decent money
Yeah
and this funding on the mortgage and all these sort of things, doesn't it?
Yeah
Whereas at the minute 
I'm not sure how much the insurance is you see that, what I've against, I mean what I'm doing, doing is co we have to have building insurance to cover the room
Mm
therefore they send the Salvation Army up
Come mum
and that it's called the Salvation Army group 
mum, mum 
so as far as I'm concerned even though it's me running it
It's the Salvation Army that's book
it's the Salvation Army books not mine
Yeah, mm
Er, oh 
I could be earning, I could be making a lot more money, for it, fund raising money for it
Mm
or for myself, if, if I thought it was me
me, aye, it could be developed that's what you're saying?
Oh yeah definitely see I've started doing a newsletter for
Mm
twenty P a week
Mm
costs me ten P to do the newsletter
Mm
getting ten pence of each person that buys it
Mm
do it, well I do it on the month
Mm, mm
I mean just small things like that 
Right 
you can push it
see if you can look at the lights er, what you call er?
Like there's Weight Watchers, Shelley's pal
Mm 
Mm 
makes a fortune
plus I can use, to do bring and buy
Aye
things, between the mothers and that, so I've got an advertising board, you know and, and if they wanted to get, to put some money in the pot or whatever
Mm, mm, mm
you just
donate a few pennies 
Get down mum 
it's surprising even the odd thirty pence here and there
Mm, mm of course it does
Yeah it's funny
Mm, mm
I'd charge fifty P see, fifty P would, would do
mm
We pay twenty five pound rent a month for the hall 
Mm, mm, mm 
twenty five pound a month on the hall
Mm
charge fifty pence per pe per family
Mm
and it's usually about, we make ten pound a morning thirty pound 
Mm, and what are they, are they, are, are they actually supposed to make money off it or is it just supposed to be a break even thing or are they quite happy
No it's not supposed to be profit making
Mm
but Social Services said to you if it's profit making
You've got to get more money
the helpers have got to get more money
Mm, mm
somebody's got to be getting more money out of it basically
Mm, mm
and the Salvation Army are getting the rent
Mm 
See the, the Salvation Army only comes up for the  
Get down  
she's got nothing to do with the money
Mm, mm, mm
but because I've got a committee
Mm
Oh go, let go
got a team of four people that help me
Mm
and I don't feel that I could be taking too much money out without putting a certain amount back into it
Mm, mm
Ah, look
but I'm going to apply to Telethon for a grant
Tele who?
Telethon
Telethon?
Yeah
Mm
cos that's the charity that's running this year
Mm
for a grant for the toys because we got the original grant from Children In Need
Mm, very good
seven hundred and fifty pounds
Mm
for the toys at the beginning
Get down mum 
but you can only do one charity at a time
Aye
get down
Yeah
Mm
Come on mum
I'm not going yet, in a minute
Get down, me come on
What you put on?
in the kitchen 
In the kitchen
What's in the kitchen?
Are you gonna have some of your juice?
No, do wee wee mum
Mm, mm
Go on then
Come on  no I am no better once I've done the course, but 
Alright 
were you are on this one I just won't it
Aye, aye, I know what you're saying 
You know what I mean?
Aye
I know more about the insurance and 
Mm 
whatever for
Mm
if you've got one two four
Mm, mm
I'm just responsible for him at mine, got notices all over the place that say
Mm
that safety belongs to the parents and
Mm, mm
you know
Like they're responsible
Yeah
Mm  I should of said, we want to get some toilet rolls at some stage today
Yeah
for wiping bottoms
and have a poo  and I don't wanna
I know you haven't  it's just one of these crosses you've got to bear haven't you?
mm
 

We're having

Er what?
Corned beef
Ha, are we?

There's some cabbage in the back
If you get it and prepare it then
And prepare it, ho, ho, ho, what's this prepare it, it's good for you, it's good cabbage, it's fine cabbage
Alright

Mm 
I'll go and get that there, if you mind him  so what nights have you got, early you want
Tracey
Er five to quarter to nine tonight, taken my Sundays away in April
Mm, will that mess things up a bit for you?
Yeah, I'll have to work, I'll have to start at half four as in the week
Mm
so I wasn't er but sure about taking the students whether put it in, but they're only sending me four I think two for a month 
What from the home?
Yeah, two for a month and then two for a
 

Can't have you not doing anything can I?
I love you
Do you?
I love you, I love er
I love you
Do you?
aargh
How's your toe today?
Let me see 
Look what I've got
Oh that's coming on ever so nicely, see this one, got no toe nail on this one, that's better, that's better
That's to put the
yeah so they've agreed for me to take fifteen pound a week instead of ten
Mm
but I'll have to, I'll have to stop doing Wednesdays if I do the course for three months
Mm, so your, your mum's got, eh the divorce finalized is she?
Well I believe so, I've not really spoken to her 
 
for very long
Accordingly to Trina there was a problem buying the house
seven hundred thousand pounds or something
Did she?
I don't know, she seemed to have told Trina 
It's ever so sad isn't it?
more about it than me
Eh?
She knows
She says according to Trina she says eh I, I, I didn't er, er, I wanted, knocked them back seven hundred thousand, but they would only, would only knock back a hundred and fifty 
You not your dad 
apparently
Yeah
I mean what sort of place  
 
what?
Wait a minute cos I might not get it right, tell me a big number 
What you mean a big number?
tell, tell you a big number, what big number?
Of house prices
House prices?
Yeah, one something, one million?
Alright one, one million 
 
dollars
Alright
Well it's more than that 
A million dollars 
Well, well one, one million and a half  
 
I would think
Yeah, but where she bought the house then?
On the sea front
In Sydney?
No Crunella it would be, which is Sydney?
That's good 
But her original house was on the water
And what was that for?
Well they got to, I don't know
They got two or three millions dollars for it
four, yeah they go up to four so she  
a lot of money for a house four million pound property
She's buying quite a cheap one I think she's buying a million 
What one and a half million?
something like that
And what's erm an Australian dollar compared with
Er probably about half, we're half here
So that's three quarters of a million she's paid for it then, we're half?
Or they're half?
Three quarters of a million pounds
What we're half?
We're double you mean?
If it's a million, if it's a million and a half dollars it's er three quarters of a million pounds
Fine, so that's three quarters of a million quid
Mm
I think that's right, you'd have to ask Trina
Mm
cos, erm
and no swimming pool,
Let's go mum
things she hasn't have
must, well they have swimming pools on the beach anyway
do they?
Mm
They have, cos you can't sell your house, in some bits you can't see the sea so you have a little pool, walk out the door and you go swimming
Can't be bad can it?
 
Can't be bad .
So she must of come out of this divorce quite well then?
Well I don't know because I, I didn't speak to her about the money, Sheila spoke to her, but she knows not to speak to me very much about money, see
Mm
so, erm
she probably
No she doesn't cos she used to like
Er she's prattling on about it
she, she used to go on about it and all this and I, I sort of fell out with her at one time, but didn't actually speak to her about it
No
so all I knew was that she got the divorce and
Mm
erm, she was buying a house for whatever it was it certainly was a lot of money 
Three quarters of million it sounds a lot 
a million
Mm
you need about a million to four million down there
Mm
cos erm Tom took his son to court
Mm
over one
Er but that's been taking about six years now 
Well that was a million then
Was it?
Yeah
Mm  it's still a lot of money for a house
Yeah, they're not fancy houses though she's got  
 
I wanna do it 
Mm, mm
Well they're fancier than here
Mm
er, but, you know what I mean 
No, not the not the best in the world
No, nothing super 
One
When she coming across?
Well she was talking about coming across in August for er grandma and grandpa's fiftieth anniversary
Mm
aargh
which is the same day
Mm
but she can't come for some
Mm
reason for Toby being at school, but Toby doesn't want to come anyway
He doesn't?
No
He had enough the last time did he?
I think so, I don't think he got on very well with grandma and grandpa and that
Mm
he didn't take to them all that well
They didn't take to him or he didn't take to 
No they didn't , well neither don't think, either they sort of much
You got on alright with him didn't you?
Yeah he was alright, I didn't like him when he was littler, maybe, he was very much like his dad, but
Mm
he's at this time he actually erm
Quite civil
Yeah, but he seemed a bit more like a normal  fifteen, sixteen  year old 
Er human 
Yeah, well he was, when he was littler his dad was sort of saying one day you'll have all this then the next minute he was saying no you won't, you won't be having any of it do you know what I mean?
That was his head was a bit of
like his dad was
Yeah, so
Mm
But he seemed quite normal and quite  you know
Mm, real
Yeah
mm  so he'll have got a settlement as well then won't he?
I would think so
There would be a trust or something probably set up for him that's the normal 
Yeah when he's eighteen but the trouble is I don't know what's happened I've lost, I suppose mum'll have to do it because erm  Tom has sort of cut him out, or said he was going to cut him out, but I think
But in any divorce settlement I know with myself 
 
Get off you don't climb on people's chairs you sit on them or you play on the floor 
but, if there's, if there's erm, if there's set if there's a settlement like that there'd been settled so much on her
Yeah
and they would also, they, she probably the, the lawyers would also go for a settlement for him the property 
I would think a lot of the money is actually in property already or she's got to have it in property
Mm, mm 
because erm, I know he had a lot, he'd like try to buy everything in property so that he didn't actually have a lot of cash
Mm, mm
so I don't know how that works
Er it was split back
Yeah
Mm  mm
but still, she said she's gonna send some for this one to have some er bonds or something
Mm, mm
but er
Who's that?
That's Arthur
Mm
Who's that pussy cat?
Is that cat 
Yeah, cos she said that she wanted to buy
is that pussy cat?
er a property or something for Toby because she's got to invest the money in
Mm
something
Mm
Is that pussy cat?
Arthur will you stop jumping all over me, get down on the floor and play
Who's that?
Yes, well she was all, so I've been speaking to her for weeks when she didn't 
Mm 
she hadn't got it 
Aye 
and then she was supposed to getting it and all the rest of it
Aye
and then when she got it she was just sort of oh I'm buying a house
Aye
and I'll try and send some over for the baby
Mm
but I didn't actually know that she got 
I have  
what have you got 
mm, mm, mm 
what or
mm, mm  yeah, better put that one in as well, you need to put them in proper so that you can get it closed
Yeah, she invited us all over at Christmas
mm, mm, aha
Did he get down?
Didn't go?
Well it was just as well we didn't, she didn't have any money 
Aye
she didn't get the settlement until after the Christmas
Oh I see
waiting for the papers to go
mm
Stop it
Will you stop your nonsense
