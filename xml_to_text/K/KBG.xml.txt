You've gotta carry it around with you.
It's on volume ten.
Well it says, like the microphone here look.
You've got to  put it at chest height
Mm.
make sure it's knocked or covered by clothing.
Cos if you have to brush  it won't break the  quality.
If you're at home you can put the machine and microphone on the table near where it will still pick up conversation.
Does that I mean work by a  from now on.
Probably.
Right  right and giving things away.
There's nothing to give away.
Where's your tapes?
Yeah, there's a load of tapes!
It's a lot isn't it?
I think they're all  I think they're ninety minutes.
Ninety minutes on each tape!
Good grief!
Well forty , I think they're C nineties.
Well I can talk the hind leg off a donkey, will 
Oh 
all that 
God!
!
Yes I know.
It makes you feel very
No, I don't think about it, just let it run.
Look at him!
Well I couldn't care cos I don't like taping  so I shouldn't !
Well  it's never stopped you before!
Mm.
Not right now though.
Oh!
I've got a cup of tea.
No, you were right what you said though about
Mm.
Matthew.
Yeah I just  it just seems to me such a complete  and utter waste of of, his time primarily  for fifteen, I mean this being identified a year earlier which  we reckon it was  you would think that  even given  all the red tape and everything else
I'll have to look up his records at least.
You know it makes you  well it makes you wonder whether  something could be done without placing him, for his sake!
Cos he's never gonna achieve anything in an ordinary class.
He's just got such a downer on himself
Mm.
and he's he's got such a  a negative  way of looking at himself  and everybody else looks at him that way now.
Cos he he, he cannot be positive  he contributes nothing!
It's hard being positive 
In his own eyes.
for him isn't it?
Well it's, I mean I feel sorry for him  but having said 
Well I do and I don't sometimes.
well having said that, although I feel sorry for him I get annoyed with him!
Yes.
Like I said he's his own worst enemy!
Because he wastes everybody's else's time.
And everybody else is fed up with him!
Well this is why I think he'd be better off,hi his needs  are not met by a class teacher.
And I don't think they have been for this last
Mm, we need a support teacher to go there.
for the last year.
But yo , you need somebody who's gonna work with him every day  and  with an individual programme and you just can't offer that  in a class.
Mm, it's difficult.
The only way you can do that is if he goes to  a special unit  at Maidstone  and works 
Well I don't think there's provision for him now you see because it's a 
Mm.
there's a term and a half left before he moves on.
Well this, this is what I'm saying, if it had been picked up  and followed through  at an earlier stage he would have been ensconced 
Oh yeah , well there must have been 
and 
a problem identified earlier on but er 
Oh!
Well I think so  I think it's been identified but I don't think it's been followed through.
Well, it's like so many other things isn't it?
Yeah, that's always the way though innit?
I just  cos when I see children like that  and you know there's nothing you can really do for them, you can't make up for the fact  that they've got a rotten home life and that's  top and bottom line that's what it is!
Yeah.
You're trying to be everything  and they're pushing it away cos it's not what they really want  and they, I mean, all, all you can get from him is how marvellous, you're right, how marvellous his brothers are  and yet, what I've heard of the brothers they're not
Not much, yeah.
they're not all that marvellous, they're not really that much to look up 
Ah.
to.
No
And they, they've
role model is it, really?
No.
I suppose marvellous to the wrong things!
Oh well!
And he he was  talking 
Was anything else  said or acted upon or  shall I use the kids who are done today ooh,tha that  should be  done.
No.
I don't think so.
Done today?
No.
No I said erm  I had a conversation with Gillian about reading, about little bits of reading  and, I made the point that we'd said last night about him barking at print, reading through words that he didn't know  and not asking what they were  and she said she'd noticed that.
And, cos we had a bit of a laugh about it, I don't know what I'm telling you about it for cos you hear him read anyway!
But she said yes, she'd noticed, but she said they are getting more out of this  Johnny Briggs book  than the other book.
Mhm.
So she's quite pleased  that she's put them on to it, it is difficult.
brilliant!
Sorry?
Nothing.
Mm.
And I saw Mrs 
Oh yes?
in the bank, I went up to the bank 
And what did she have to say for herself?
She's alright.
I just don't feel that  you know, she's basically taken Robert back last night, that was very kind of her and all that, she said oh it's been nice to have him and  erm  but er  Oliver and Robert had got on really well  and erm   that's all really .
Are you still working?
Yeah !
It's alright 
Er 
it's just some noise I heard on the tape.
oh and we were jus well we just sort of cha , I was just talking about the weather, she was saying how cold it was.
And erm  and I made the point that I  tipped all your lot out of I said what and   I hadn't let them go in the classroom and I said it's a new thing but  I said they got their coats on  they're too macho to wear them that's their problem, you know!
They've got their coats in school.
But we they were very good about going out, I'm not going up to her again!
She's just gonna have to cry herself to sleep I'm afraid.
I've just 
Mm.
had enough of her now!
She's tired, she's had a busy day, so
When was she last asleep?
Erm  just before I came in from school  and we were home by about half three.
But she's ready to go off really, she probably would have done if Robert hadn't tipped the milk everywhere!
Was she asleep by then?
And then ranted and raved cos she probably just about going off then, you see it woke her up all the fuss and kerfuffle!
Mm.
I was so mad with him for doing it!
So silly!
The trials and tribulations of a family life!
Mm.
Trials and tribulations!
I tell you a ou I said today when I was in school  cos that's like being at home with my three year old, it was just like that today being stuck in there!
I'll just go up and see to her.
Alright.
And try and sort her out.
Where's your  bit of paper then you have to fill in on this?
About where you're  working and what you're doing and  who you're doing it with  and how often!
The log book?
Yeah,that's the word !
Ha!
The  the log book!
Near the dictionary, yeah.
I 
there's quite a few questions innit?
You get  a conversation record booklet, tapes one to ten.
Where's your ?
Sorry that was the one I was looking for.
Each side covers one side, forty five minutes of a ninety minute tape.
Mind you, there's been a great pause on it while you went to see to the baby.
Mm.
So then they're all the details, and there's examples and
So, you're gonna take that out with you tomorrow?
When we go and buy the corn and er  goat mix?
I could do.
I'm just trying to think where you  what you're gonna do when I have my, have my hair cut?
I don't know.
I'll find something.
I'll be about an hour  I reckon.
I must find that photo as well.
The erm  take it with me.
I feel I should be all philosophical and  start  spouting!!
What about?
I dunno.
It sounds good.
I'm spouted out I think!
I told you that I was punned today didn't I?
I'd 
Mm.
suddenly forgotten, it suddenly just  it just didn't  twig with them at all.
They didn't laugh when he mentioned then?
Yeah they  they groaned at the ones we'd come up with  but when it came to making their own up
And they couldn't.
they'd come out with half of one, they'd come out with things like  I think you're  er  I dunno  er, not barking up the wrong tree that was the wrong one, but  the they'd sort of come out with half of a pun and they wouldn't finish it off, like oh th , this is smashing!
Sa , and I'd say  yeah but that's not a pun  that's only a pun if you  if you write down this is smashing  said  erm  the robber or the smash and grab, in other words the window fell in, that kind of thing, you know.
Well anyway how do , does that link with sea 
Well  we had to 
words ?
we, no we broaden it  i i , they they just couldn't manage on the sea ones .
Cor there's loads!
Oh they couldn't si , yeah don't forget yo , well I don't know why I'm telling you, but, you know your ri , your age range.
They managed to get some  ones on the sea, but they did have a try  erm  a lot of them come up with the erm  barking up the wrong tree said the dog, you know, things like that  with a bit of help.
Yeah.
Erm  there's another one that a lot of came up with  one or two had heard  a few before  and they all groaned and then accused you of making them all up!
I said, no, actually  but that's always a lie !
Oh I thought you might say that!
So they all laughed at 
Mm.
that and then  but that was quite hard really!
When I think about it they did ha erm, but I'm fed up with talking about school!
Let's talk  about something else !
School's banned now is it?
Yeah.
I don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
What a wicked dog!
Oh God !
You're gasping for air are you?
Cor blimey!
I don't know what my mother's fed that dog  today , but  it's certainly repeating on him tonight!
Mm.
Kick him out then.
Mm, he's laying there pretending it's not him, look!
Get him off that carpet!
Oh dear!
Oh Laura  I must just 
Get him off the carpet!
I must just tell you this, Laura did make me laugh, cos she said  she stood up and she said, I'm gonna give my talk about cats  so I said, fine.
She said, and I'm gonna talk about my cat Ginger and my brother's car an , and my brother's Barney, oh by the way Barney's dead!
So she just carried on !
Oh , that's the end of that  conversation !
!
But she spoke of  and she kept speaking about him being 
So matter of fact.
in the  she kept speaking about him as tho , as though he was all, you know, still alright, and that was just so funny the way she said it and I thought I mustn't laugh cos that  er,i she doesn't intend to be funny with it at all!
That was quite good, in fact, she'll have 
Oh.
talking about school!
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
School's banned!
They're doing some good things at weekend.
Oh aye?
Such as?
Having carpet down in one corridor!
Nice.
And they're painting the walls!
Mm mm!
wine , yeah lovely!
Mm!
How's the new Head going down now then?
Well  mixed I think.
There are those who  struggling with the old Head who never knew what was going on  and like 
Yeah.
this Head
They like him?
and there are those who  think this new one's
Too  too squeaky!
To squeaky ?
gone in , no no no, she's just gone in and er  doing too much too soon, yeah, yeah.
They're a very established staff you know 
Well it's 
there's not been much change 
Yeah I see it, over that, I mean that's Suffolk all over isn't it, really for you?
Th they si they sit and look at change for ten 
Mm.
years and then they think, yeah we might do something  and then they actually go out and do it !
Yeah , watching the grass grow is pretty
Yeah.
dramatic down here!
Sometimes it can be, yeah.
Yeah, it's interesting though!
I mean, it looks nice it's  see I'm impressed with her  I must admit, impressed with her.
It looks better than it did.
And the decor.
Well that'll totally depress Terry  if he goes there then  won't it?
But theirs is bigger, they've got a pottery room, they've got careers education there
Yeah,
they've got two classes, they're looking to the library.
Yeah but I mean yours is  a big school now isn't it?
Well ours has got  loads more pupils than theirs!
And they've just got more room haven't they?
They've got, they've 
Yeah, well they've got an old secondary modern school there.
Well it's the old six, yeah that's right.
That's why.
Oh 
I mean they've got the facilities purposely built 
Cor, too right!
really, that's  that'd be lovely!
It's ideal!
I mean, we should have their site.
Yeah.
It's like the girls said to me today, erm  just before the end of  I'm doing it again!
But anyway, just before the end of the morning, they said erm  could we practise our talks on each other, and there was only ten minutes left so I said, yes  and they said well can we go somewhere quiet?
And the only way  place I could  think to send them was the girls' changing room!
Oh.
There wasn't anywhere else!
Wasn't it?
Cos the library was being used
it was a quiet 
the hall was, they're getting ready for lunch 
yeah it was a quiet joke at the staff meeting that er
you know and
my office is er  gonna be taken over  because they need the extra toilets!
Ha!
I would say oh they do for these extra classroom they're gonna 
Well you ma ah, made me laugh when you just sit there in that corner  doing paperwork!
Like when you were in the other week and I was taking that class
I don't normally sit there.
Well it was just so funny, it's just the kind of place you'd expect to see naughty  boys, there was you sitting to the
Yeah, but I was quiet, I was hardly 
marking papers , you know!
Well there aren't any other places!
Oh I know!
I mean Terry said I could use his office but
You feel as though it's
he keeps coming in and
ah, it feels
and the secretary's knocking on the door, the telephone rings, and  I got a bit of work done.
that's inhibiting as well isn't it?
And it's almost like  crowding somebody's personal space  if you go in their office.
And, I feel that when I go in your room now  very much that it is your room, and I feel the same when I go in Glenys's, it's her room
Well  I mean that should be 
and you're a visitor there which is  as it should be.
it shouldn't be after, what , seven years?
Yeah.
But that's just it.
Never been painted, never been clean and tidy.
Ah but  but it's, it's all to do with  having your own personal space I think.
Yeah, be o , interesting if they are.
Cos mum made me laugh tonight  but she came in and  she said oh you can have a hot cross bun there, I said well  I think I'll have a piece of chocolate cake and she said  alright then!
I said, oh I'm glad you approve being as though it's mine and it's  my house, I can eat what I want!
And she'd just totally forgotten !
Mm.
Comfortable 
So 
you see.
i , it was really quite funny!
But  you  cos she'd said   
 
looking after the littlest ones all day and  and she's obviously been speaking to them like that during 
Ah.
the day and  got this  that's like your grandma did that with erm  with June  once or 
Yeah.
twice.
And June wanted to go out and yo , your granny said  make sure you're  back before midnight !
Mm.
There she was   a married woman with a
She's a right wally?
mm  kids as well!
They assume an awful lot man.
Yeah.
The elderly do.
The wrinklies, now there's a word!
In common  usage, the wrinklies !
Yeah.
As the children  so sweetly call them!
Oh, woe betide anybody who calls me one!
Yeah, I know.
I've seen so many grey hairs .
Am I a wrinkly yet ?
Is this the sign of  wrinklydom!
You know !
Wrinkly !
Wrinklydom.
There such a 
Oh.
word?
I dunno, erm  don't think there's such a 
There ought to be!
as wrin , now I know where that's come from.
What wrinkly?
Naff, as well, is another word  that the kids use a lot.
It's really naff!
No, I think that's passed out 
 
now.
They don't like  .
It's out of 
What was that word that erm  Ebony  was, used?
And I  wa commented on it  to you, it was when I borrowed  the maternity robe from Penny  and she 
 
said one, talking about one of the dresses  and that meant it was really awful and I can't think what 
Gross?
Gross!
Yeah.
That's American though isn't it?
Well, well that's them,Ro Robert uses that.
Does he?
Well Christopher came in here the other day and he says that cake is 
Oh yes,las , yes last night, mm.
really  gross !
Yeah I know.
Gross!
Gross!
But when you used to look at the te , you know, the children's television programmes, they're 
Yeah.
nearly all American, the cartoons.
Yes it's a  hundred and forty four isn't it, a gross?
Yeah.
Suppose so.
With the old numbers.
Yeah.
I don't remember using that.
Ace, was the word  that we used a lot.
Carry on.
It's ace!
Ah, everything was ace, and ace that!
Oh god I  it dates me !
Carbon dates, you!
Oh no chance!
Makes me seem ever so old!
Oh.
Looking round at people today and  you mi , try to imagine them  in their own home setting  you know?
And what they're like  out of work  you know?
It's  I mean it's  it's difficult to picture people anywhere other than where you actually meet them at work.
I can't im , with not knowing where they live, I mean I can't envisage where  what kind of houses I mean 
 
some of them  have got, some .
Quite interesting.
Oh.
Are we gonna watch Victoria Wood at nine?
If you want to.
I like that.
Seen them all before!
Ah but they're funny!
They are funny!
Oh!
Hang on, I wanna watch the  the 
Oh!
Good Guys!
That's finished innit?
No, there's  one more episode, I'm sure there is.
Oh that's really  naff!
Well I prefer that to  Victoria Wood!
Oh, well I'll tape Victoria Wood then cos I like that!
Them 
Mm.
Good Guys, it gets more of  outrageous every week, you can't believe a word of it!
There's no plot to it at all, it's  it's just so farfetched!
Well then  we'll watch Victoria Wood then.
Oh!
Alright then !
If you want to watch it now darling.
Well I mean I've watched that  the Good Guides   Guys !
They're the Good Guides!
The guys !
I watched the 
Put your teeth in.
Good Guys sa a couple of times and    whether it was gonna improve or not  but it hasn't!
Been waiting for it to get better every week and it 
Well this could be the episode!
And you've missed it!
Yeah!
Cos we've been watching the repeat of Victoria Wood!
Oh yeah, if we see
Why is that Care Bear down there, has she had it out the bath?
Probably.
difficult to sleep innit?
No, you tell them, I'm fed up of telling kids off today!
You haven't had any to look after today!
None of your kids!
This week I have.
Mm.
I didn't have no   didn't have any complaints at dinner time,
Oh  I don't care Sue, I'm not bothered.
Mm.
That's alright then.
Oh one of the hens got  erm  landed on the top of the black net  cos I  I'd put some  corn and stuff in you see  and she landed on it  and she got her feet stuck through netting  so she was flapping and the net was just going  up and down !
It's quite er
No  that, that'll give way, that will be alright.
Now as she, I flapped it, I got hold of it and I flapped it so it, I sort of bounced about, she sort of bumped along 
Yeah, you have to.
until she got onto that crossbar  and then she just flew straight back and did exactly the same thing all over again and I just thought  sod it!
I left her on there!
Yeah.
And that she'll just have to take a chance tonight.
Cos she saw me putting the corn in and she decided she'd try and get it  by diving through the black net  instead of going through the gate, like with a normal hen, you know, this one's obviously brain  dead or
They are stupid that lot!
They are silly!
Mum said they'd been all over today!
Dad opened the front door and he said there was a troop of them walking up the path!
He said, he just said get out of it!
They all we , turned round and went the other way again !
Surprising that he'd talked back to them, yes.
Yeah.
But the , I mean I came home and they were under the hedge  they weren't going through but  there's a big piece of netting  has come down  and it needs  erm  stitching up and then it needs  sewing, not sewing  erm 
That's alright, if it's fine let me do that.
i , but it needs two of us, it needs somebody on the inside and somebody on the out  just to stop them flying  through it.
Cos the, the the the cock was on the back door this morning, crowing!
Somebody there was crowing  at about half past twelve, quarter to one this morning!
There were two of them crowing their heads off!
Oh I never heard them
Yes!
Oh God we'll be popular round here won't we?
That's what I thought.
I never heard them Carl!
I mean you're not locking him in any more are you?
You're not shutting the door.
Well I  I hadn't been shutting the one  that don't make no difference still, there's only  cos Pavarotti's out anyway!
Cos he he won't   
Yeah but you don't let the other two, I mean  it's 
I ought to  perhaps we ought to start closing them in again then that'll keep 
Yeah, perhaps you ought to.
them quiet.
But the trouble was  with closing them in, not so much on the , but on the old flock  it was so warped, the wood with being damp and wet and frosty  it was freezing across every night and it was nearly taking my fingers off
Mm.
getting it open in the morning, that really hurt!
Well put a little loo loop or something there.
It's too, too rotten, the wood.
But I've got, what I've gotta do is repair that other coop
Mm.
and get that there and then it'll be a lot easier  cos mum said she struggled today to get in that door  of the , I said well what do you go in there for?
And she was going in for eggs or something, said well I usually leave them a day or two in the winter cos it doesn't hurt  and she said she struggled and struggled with that door!
She said it hasn't got any   at the minute!
I said, well no cos it was on, like strings  but er that does need fixing.
But it's just been too wet and too nasty to do anything about it so  when we've got a chance we'll have to really do.
She said she's  looking forward to the day that we get it fixed !
Said, oh I'm sorry mum, I'll go and get you some eggs!
Cos they are quite tame, I mean that's one thing about the hens  I mean  they can't come out though, they just wander about.
And it  but the erm  the goats apparently were no problem today, they just stayed on and  gave them a few bits and pieces you know  so   that was fair enough .
Oh, I wish she'd hurry up and go to sleep!
I think I'll have to put her down again then.
Put her down!
I can't understand it!
I mean she's  she's been up  and been busy and  she's had a warm bath and she's had a bottle of
She'll start this caper again though!
Yeah, coming in at night.
I wo , well she was awake in the middle of the night, I don't know what time it was but all I could hear was mummy, mummy, mummy!
Why didn't you just put her back  into bed!
And I lay her down and she bawls!
Well it doesn't matter!
I didn't hear her!
Well, I heard her!
And I feel really guilty, I think oh I better bring her in  and then she wakes me up at six o'clock bouncing on the bed!
So  And o , also  when it's the day before I, I'm working  I'm very conscience that I don't want her to be upset in the morning, same with Christopher  I don't want any upsets in the morning.
I don't want her frazzled  and I don't want him upset in the morning cos I wanna  go out and have a nice  even keel then
Mm.
and not have to worry that  they're er  gonna be a problem for mum 
Yeah.
to look after you see, so  I think if that's the price we gotta pay if it's  a choice between tha 
Oh yes!
putting up with that  and me not going out  then I'm afraid we'll just have to put up with it!
Cos it's  it's too  erm  expensive to do otherwise.
That's what I reckon anyway.
Aren't you gonna turn that off yet?
No, we'll let the first side run.
Are we?
We'll 
Mm.
play it up  later on!
You're doing very well thank you !
I think I've only said about three words in  you're doing all the chatting.
Well you can't get a word in edgeways  can't you?
No.
I'm used to it!
No you're not!
Oh well of course that's making me have a parched throat you know, so you're gonna have to ma , go and make me a cup of tea!
Please?
No, you're making me one.
Oh go on!
No.
Why's that pendulum blue?
Oh, pass!
I've no idea.
Pendulum why are you blue?
I don't know   said the pendulum!
I don't know dear!
I don't know.
We've got big cobwebs up there and all!
Don't tell  everybody our secrets !
Sorry!
Oh dear!
It's quite a surprise!
Mm.
Yeah.
This is what could be termed in  as a   a pregnant pause !
Oh!
Level four, attainment target two it'll be .
Oh, oh I dunno !
You get gobble-eyed looking at all those dockets.
Well I had a quick look at them.
Oh no, you're doing it again, you're talking about school!
We can't talk about school, it's boring  
No, I'm gasping for a cup of tea!
What are we gonna do now?
Well if I go through now she's just  quietened again  just wait until sh , there's no noise at all from up there, give it another ten minutes.
Okay.
Then  and then I think hopefully she'll settle.
Has she got a dolly in her cot with her?
She does like that so  we'll have to go and get Christopher's present won't we?
On Monday.
Still seems quite keen on a  train 
Yes he does seem  keen on the railway track.
Anything, apart from get away from tractors for a bit!
Trouble is, is the floor space, he puts it out and  gets stood on.
Yeah.
We'll have to encourage him to put in on the table.
Mm, scratch the table, yeah!
Mm.
Oh he's, oh dad's buying a sander did I tell you?
No I didn't.
Dad's buying a sander.
Cos he said to me, he said don't rush in to stripping that table cos he's gonna buy a sander  to keep his  
Did you tell him we were gonna do the table?
Yep.
He said leave it don't do it yet.
I said, well we hadn't intended doing it yet cos the children being so young  that er  that's what he needs.
And he said to me, he said if you hang on  erm, he said you can borrow it  and sand it all down, you know?
So, I thought that was  nice of him.
It'll be nice that.
Yeah.
I thought it was a good idea.

Or Peter's he said.
I said oh well they must have cut the film off there.
Twenty pounds .
I think Janet bought one of them.
What's an aerial photograph?
That's a picture taken from a helicopter or an aeroplane.
Usually an aeroplane.
Oh I'm tired.
No that's a lie, I'm not tired really I'm just  ugh 
Mm.
That's still for sale.
Yeah it's been for sale for a long time.
It's been for sale for ages hasn't it?
Big garden on that you know.
They're all large gardens aren't they, round here?
Yeah.
Nice fr , nice frame that is.
Yeah   There's one or two that are, well I say that every week, there's one or two houses that I'd    
It's 
school.
very  it's very rural.
I know.
My problem is I want  the comforts of rural living with the convenience of urban life.
You can't even get a compromise really round here in that you've gotta have one or the other.
You've gotta go one for the other.
Unless you're a two car family.
any crisps 
 

Sshh stop wrangling or we won't go.
Those are nice houses.
 

Again as you say it's in the middle of nowhere innit?
That's right.
gets me cos the church isn't central.
Oh it is between the two  villages.
Mm.
Funny .
Oh look at that young one.
Oh mummy goats.
Yes, they're lovely aren't they?
the dinosaur has fallen over.
They're milking goats. 
Thank you Rebecca.
Ha, singing away .
Mm.
I've brought a spare swimsuit this morning.
Daddy  mummy.
She's going through everything.
She's going through the
All the words she knows.
all the wor yeah, process.
Is that mud on the road?
Yeah it is.
That's a nice house
Yeah  it's the farmhouse innit?
Well no cos the farmhouse is next door innit?
The big white one.
That might be one of those that  you know, family build.
Yeah.
Barry.
Sorry Robert?
Barry.
Who's Barry?
Monkey.
Oh the chimp  yeah .
Barry the monkey, yes I know who you mean.
Little  toy.
Oh!did you see that 
What was it?
That's a nice house isn't it?
Oh I didn't realize the shop had closed 
Oh I don't, I think so.
I think it's been closed for a long time actually.
Getting on with that aren't they?
Doing a good job.
Do you fancy that then?
What?
That house there.
Oh somebody'll be doing it up themselves.
It'll be a smart house.
Erm on a bad bend though innit?
Er  not really.
Yeah that's where the shop used to be, you're right, yeah.
Yeah it is shut, yeah.
Yeah 
oh been closed ages that has.
Oh I never knew that, there's one for sale there Carl, house.
Mind we always said we wouldn't buy another old house didn't we?
Mm.
I would put in for that if it came up.
Would you?
I think so.
school.
Well it would be silly not to wouldn't it?
Give it a go.
Well it wouldn't be much different to what you're doing now, but you may be  would you be 
Well 
paid more?
Not much.
wouldn't be a lot different would it?
I don't know how erm  
No the only parent  I knew 
Georgie .
Yes and erm
She was pleased  
I think  's dad  Paul, Timmy  's dad was the chairman of governors.
Oh and he thought they were good did he?
Oh and that, that little boy who was at  school, Nicholas, he went there didn't he?
He's still there I think.
Is he?
Oh well she's obviously decided she likes it.
Either that or  she's run out of schools to send him to .
Yeah.
Probably a bit nearer the mark.
I think that's one of the drawbacks though to a village school.
Er it can be very nice, very cosy, but I 
See that also epitomizes what I was saying before, you know I mean if I'm there you could be stuck there for the remainder.
teaching.
Oh yeah.
And there's always the danger of it  could it be changed, and then  you've got the whole curriculum area to look after.
Instead of having three to look after I'd probably end up having to look after a seven or eight.
Yeah.
But you see I, I don't know  I can see what you mean, but I don't know whether a move would be the answer cos I think you're  if you're gonna stay in teaching this is what's gonna happen.
I mean it's, there must be a time when it settles.
wherever you go  wherever you go there's gonna be all this upheaval and  I mean let's face it if the Tories don't get in this time, and pray god they don't, Labour's gonna completely 
Yeah  
alter everything  that's gone before .
They'll keep very little in.
Yeah I know.
And that doesn't fill me with any great er 
But I, I mean which er you, you look and you think well 
Well 
which is the wor er it's gonna be bad whi whoever's in charge really.
the Scottish Nationals.
At least from the point of  with Labour at least they  most of them  send their kids through the state system so they've got a little more idea of what they're talking about.
But that still boils down to the fact that everybody thinks they know how schools work  cos they've been at school themselves.
I get really fed up with the whole 
Mm
Seem like all we ever do is talk about schooling other people's children.
Well  it's never too far from the back of your mind though is it really?
No.
It's funny I mean I find I'll say something, I'll think oh so and so would like that and I'm  about other people's kids,why they're  .
Oh!
Go on you naughty boy.
Silly thing.
Pheasant.
Yeah a pheasant  ran across the road.
They normally do that.
I s it's a good job I, it was in the grass verge cos I saw the
That's the male though cos er they're a nice colour 
They're very colourful, yeah.
I, I saw it too.
There's lots of them about.
It's probably from 
 
round here actually.
Yeah could be off this pork farm, oh no he'd kee he'd breed partridge not pheasant wouldn't he?
She's gone to sleep.
poke her awake  swimming now.
Yeah.
Yeah I always wanna paint that a different colour.
Yeah it's a bit garish.
Well you'd better go and do the paying this week then  then you can do the tape while you're paying can't you?
Yeah.
Tape while you pay, yeah I will do.
Looks familiar doesn't it?
Mm a line of washing.
line of washing.
I think they had to close this pub down you know I was listening to somebody talk about it  cos there were drugs going on in it.
Really?
Yeah, they were drugs.
No I, I, no I heard a different tale, I heard that he er fell out with his wife, and he tried to kill her.
Oh  
I can't remember who told me but I'm sure it was  sure it was that one.
Oh yeah it was Janet told me when we went shopping, Christmas shopping.
She said ooh th they're talking about   But whether he er  whether he attempted to kill her and  managed it I don't know but that, that was what I heard anyway.
Carrots there look.
Oh yeah.
Oh a lot there isn't there?
Do you wanna buy a carrot when we get back?
Erm  yeah I suppose we can do, they'll have to stay in the outhouse though  I don't know.
No  
Well  take some for your mum.
I could do.
I was gonna take her some eggs as well.
Oh  eggs and carrots.
Help out with the food.
But it does though doesn't it?
That's lovely when the hens come back into full flush like this  
Well we we'll stop and you can have a look  and if they're any good
Yeah well I'll see what cash I've got left as well cos I haven't got a lot of money on me.
I hope that blooming chequebook comes .
If not we  draw it all out in cash which is gonna be a drag  carrying a lot of money round Colchester 
No, no well be well before we go over to Colchester we'll go into Framlingham and er
Call in at the bank, yeah.
get er  one drawn up.
Yeah.
I'm sure  it should be  
It was a lot easier it was a lot easier when they used to give them to you over the counter.
I know it was.
All this, it's all got computerized.
Oh he's got a wrestler just like ours, that guy.
Thought it was a familiar   These trees have er taken nice haven't they?
It's nice to see the sun shine on the place again though innit?
Yeah .
Doesn't it put 
Really colou 
a different perspective on things as well?
Really colourful.
Mm it is a nice area.
As you say you get used to it.
Take it for granted like everything else, I know.
I told you, you know said that  there will be 
Mhm 
an old garage.
Oh I've gone past, have we passed that one where the pygmy goats are 
 
like ours?
They've got black and white pygmies.
No it's in, it's in Stradbroke innit?
Is it?
Yeah.
That used to be a pub I think.
Sorry?
That used to be a pub.
Yeah, The Swan

Do we just le do we just leave them and not put them in a locker?
No.
Oh no, just put them up here.
Cos now that we're in the swimming pool getting changed I'll turn this off.
a lot of myths surrounding Down's Syndrome children as to what they can and can't do you see  and er 
Well it's good to see them in the bath anyway having a good  good old splash about, you know?
Yeah.
She said she hasn't, I said do you bring her every week?
She said no she said we haven't been for ages.
That's what she said to me.
Cos I said I'm really surprised, I said I thought you must come at least every week cos she seems to be so confident in the water.
She said she hadn't been for a while  and erm  then she said  they didn't really know, they wondered how she was gonna get on in the water.
Ah no she's fine.
Yeah cos they're not supposed to, you see there again, Down's Syndrome children are not supposed to be able to float.
Well she was doing a
Well she had some floats on I know but
Well she's only a tot isn't she?
Mhm.
No I thought, cos I, I remember reading erm  I think it's her father who owns one of the bookshops in Woodbridge and he had this book on display, you know he sort of erm  advertised it if you like  and it's, it's properly published and everything but he had it as a  a book available in his store and there was an advert in the Anglian about it, and I remember reading that she said  er that he said er cos it was his daughter who had the child, that it totally knocked them for six.
They never dreamt that it could happen cos she wasn't in  the risk age group or anything, it just never crossed their minds that it might happen and they were totally  well they just didn't know what to think.
Was there any explanation of it?
Really shocked.
No.
And she's o she's gone on to have a, a normal little boy you see?
Just a fluke of nature.
Ah.
She's, she's younger than me.
She's, she's in her twenties and theoretically the, the risk is 
She lo she looks older.
Yeah but she's not, she's in her twenties and theoretically 
She looked about mid thirties I thought.
No she's not.
Not as old as that.
I think she was 
Oh look mummy  
ah there's the pygmies.
They've got  see they've got their tether.
Mummy  
Yes yeah.
And er  the fact that she's obviously gone on without  it was awful, when she was pregnant  the second time round  she didn't make a big thing of being pregnant but you could tell she was pregnant but I never quite liked to say to her just in case they had the amnio amnio whatever it is and decided not to go 
Aye they would have done won't they?
ahead you'd, yeah but you can't have that till sixteen weeks  and by then you sh you know  you show don't you?
Anyway  she's had a little boy and he's fine, he's got a cold that's why he wasn't in today.
That was mum and dad wasn't it?
Yeah.
Sorry?
It was dad who was outside?
Yeah dad dad had got the baby outside, yes.
I don't know him at all, I've never met him.
But I used to
So where do they live then?
Well I th they live in the catchment area for Fram because she used to go the 
Mhm.
and I think she sa I think her little daughter goes to the Rainbow thing    Kate doing her largesse, you know  let the heathens in  
She didn't know who I was obviously?
No, no.
No I don't go round saying who you are.
No.
It's nice  i it's a rare 
Right.
a breath of fresh  air  if you like  when people don't know.
I tell you who else was there erm the lady who used to do caretaking for you at school you know, who had a little girl  months before Becca was born.
Mrs ?
No
Monday lady, oh the other little lady yeah 
oh no 
the other lady.
the lady with black hair.
The one whose baby kept on being very very quiet and never 
that's why  she's still quiet and she's still tiny.
She looks nowhere near as old as Rebecca and she's a month older.
I never saw her.
No we no she'd got out the pool you see, she was  I didn't recognize her, she said oh it looks like all the family's here and I was only talking to Evelyn  and, and I kept trying to place her and it was only when she said oh Rebecca was born a month after cos she's  died her hair a different colour , I didn't, just didn't recognize her at all.
But erm yeah  can't remember what she called her little girl, Michelle I think or Michaela   name anyway.
But  well Evelyn was asking me about reading and writing but  first of all she asked did we still go to  you see and I said  no  I sa we s I said we decided it didn't suit him.
Oh she said  why was that?
I said well we had  I said I had a bit of a run in with the lady who ran it, I didn't agree that he should be compelled to do singing which she thought he should I said and we had a   decided it cos he .
Oh she said it's silly making him do that I said er very quickly I said, I said don't get me wrong I said for kids who enjoy going to that sort of thing it's great  and fine if it's alright  
 
but I don't want anybody accusing me of  er
Right.
causing bad feeling or trying to upset her trade, I mean we know she's rubbish but  erm I, I said er I just said well  the children who enjoy it  enjoy it I said but he never really settled and er we felt that between us we'd got over twenty years' experience of working with children, we reckoned we knew a little bit more  about what makes children tick.
And er  she agreed.
Yeah, it's fair enough Sue.
Yeah.
Well I thought I've gotta be careful that I  don't sound too
Pompous.
erm 
Know it all.
Well no not so much that but, but I'm not, I'm not sure that other lady, the one whose baby was born just after er before Becky you see and I thought  could just imagine her being saying  going and saying something and getting, it getting  moulded a different way, you know?
And then I thought oh bugger it, I'm entitled to my opinion and I made the point that  
Yeah and you have done on more than one occasion 
it just didn't  just didn't suit Chris a bit.
Wasn't for Chris.
So what did she say?
And she said she said well her little boy, Christopher, loves it but he's a quiet child you see  he thrives on that kind of thing.
And she, he was always quiet when we were at the erm  t twos to threes.
And er  and she said he enjoys it and he goes to playgroup  I think he must go to Dennington playgroup cos he's going to Dennington school, and he enjoys sitting down and being, likes looking at books and he's started writing and she said  actually she said I'm really panicking because I'm frightened that I might be teaching him wrong and  that I'm  I said well why don't you pop in and have a word at the school?
No I'll leave it  I haven't got one fifty I don't think.
I've got one pound.
Yes I have got one fifty.
Here you are.
I've got it, it's alright.
Well have a check in the bag.
Have a check first, if you think they're good we'll have
Are they one fifty?
One fifty a bag
Oh look at the horse

That one's got a big fly walking about in it.
Have one of these further u I've put me one fifty down so  have that one Carl, that's nice, they're nice and firm.
They're firm.
Hang on.
I mean some of them further down will be a big wiggly worm but the goats will  goats will eat them.
Right?
See we've got one or two soft ones in there but 
Let go.
as I say the goats will eat them.
That's one of ours, that's just, yeah.
Put it in the back and, and that one.
Right.
Put them in.
Pop that one in, there we go, and I'll definitely  
Right.
Cor they're heavy.
There's a good twenty five kilos here I'd of thought.
Well the thing is  give some mum.
I can feed the goats on the ones that are not  
Hold them safe.
What's it like?
Nice.
Lounge, dining room, study.
Is there?
Yeah there's a study.
Must be a small study then.
No it's about the size of our bathroom and toilet put together.
Is it?
Study's there.
Well where's their bath and toi upstairs is it?
Upstairs, everything will be  
Not much garden though is there?
Er  there's quite a lot, it goes round the side, round that way, it's a big L shape.
Yeah.
And you've got all this round the back here.
Yeah.
I don't even know how much it is.
Oh yeah  garden.
Yeah there is.
I mean alright  the pub garden's next to it.
Yeah there's that, yeah there may be  noise and  pretty though 
No well I don't know though, there wouldn't be much 
Oh look at that 
Oh  trust Andrew .
Trouble is you'd 
And the pub, there's nobody in the pub look.
it's your catchment area again though isn't it?
Well  
Brun Brundish is Wilby.
Aha.
It's Wilby catchment and Stradbroke.
Yeah.
Look there's the garden.
Oh yeah.
Is that ?
No.
No.
But I just wanted to see what it had downstairs, it was typically new, it's a, a lounge not much bigger than the one we've got now erm  in fact I think the lounge and the dining room area was probably a little bit smaller
Yeah.
but a bigger kitchen  a downstairs loo  er
They probably have a bathroom upstairs as well 
Y oh yes it would have, and er a small  
Well move then, is that what you wanna do?
Ooh  hell's teeth no.
Couldn't afford it, and we couldn't sell our house Sue.
I don't think anyone can sell anything at the moment.
I think something like that one could be going for about eighty five thousand.
Sorry?
Well it's been gone, it's been built for a year er er er er it's been up for ages hasn't it?
Yeah well they, they sold it at the wrong ti I mean they built it the wrong time didn't they?
They missed the boat.
It's nice 
It's just its location  but it's nice.
Perhaps we just need to decorate and then 
Yes.
we'll feel better about ours.
Ours, ours has got a bigger garden.
I don't like that one because of its proximity to the pub.
Yeah  well Robert said why have we stopped so I said I think we're looking because it's a typical new house and daddy wants to see what typical new houses now offer.
I just wanna see for some ideas Robert really, you know?
It was Andrew who asked that  
Oh 
Oh was it?
Sorry I thought  
Just i ideas for decoration and
Yeah.
I'm gonna have my kitchen rose pink I've decided.
I think the toilet needs to be, well if I do the toilet this week
the bathroom.
The bathroom, sorry, the bathroom.
Well the toilet needs doing any 
Yeah only needs to be done white doesn't it?
If I do that 
the bathroom and the toilet  matching and then your room needs doing.
Oh we're gonna do our room at Easter time I think.
Yeah, we should
I've got that targeted I think for an Easter job.
we won't have time to do it this holiday Robert, there won't be time  
The bathroom and the, and the kitchen.
And I'm working in March.
I don't know what I'm doing April yet but I'm definitely working in March.
Yeah nobody knows what's happening April time as yet.
Cuts into the, it cuts into the we the weeks, I mean that sounds terrible, I'll be,you're only working a few days but it's surprising the teaching days I do  really, that really does cut into my time at home.
Not that I mind but it just means  things like  painting and decorating  what you looking  
I'm just trying to get me bearings.
I'm sure Brundish is Wilby.
Oh it is.
That's a nice one .
Always be terrified that that was gonna  drop to bits wouldn't you?
It's like that one at Debenham.
Not for sale or anything is it?
No, no I just noticed it, it was empty.
And you're  miles from anywhere here.
Well it's er I mean look at me now, I'm, I'm  oh  I can walk in to Fram
You can get in.
but I can get in to Fram and if I need to go to the doctors I can get to the doctors  which unfortunately is, is necessary  our children.
Yeah we've gotta look outsi all over.
Are those carrots alright Andrew?
I think they're looking at all the 
Aha.
Oh I can give a couple to the goats as well 
Oh yeah.
that's nice .
I don't know where to put them tethers .
They're chewing up the lawn but Carl there's nowhere else to put them at the moment.
Mm no I know.
When I ask for a carrot now mummy I, I'll just  have a big feast.

Peculiarly =liarly yeah 
and she'd got in touch with him.
So Steven said now what do you make of that?
I said well I think she realized it came to  so he's definitely booked the high court so she's, she's done nothing about changing him or anything like that.
I said I reckoned she got her oar in first and thought I'm gonna   
No I I should say her solicitors  has told her you, you know, you've got to tread  carefully 
 
you're on a sticky wicket.
Yeah.
Very.
Yeah.

He reckon she actually got in touch with Martin.

Absolutely.
She'll try the approach of  oh well I'm sure you meant well but it really wasn't in Richard's best interests for him to have overnight access and all this 
Mm and all this lark.
That's what I reckon she'll try for.
Yeah, yes that's why  
But he's not daft, Martin, anyway.

Walnut's harder and shinier than satin wood.

Excuse me

It's for polishing brass.
Mhm.
Ooh.
No Becky stop it, leave your foot alone.
 

Hurry up.
Who's in there, Andrew?
Yeah.
You just can't keep track of them Sue .
The thing is I'm, oh you can't worry because there's so many people watching
well  they was all wearing their clothes standing there, with poles with big round  rings on pulling people out.
 

Frightened him to death.
Said he hurt his foot  
Frightened him to death it did.
But he wanted to go.
We went down we went down both shutes.
Yeah well you don't know till you try these things 
 
do you, whether
He'll go down the shutes alright.
He surprised me, he was the first one down them great big shutes.
Andrew come, just come out  as large as life .
And Christopher went, he went down the slide we, we just left him on his own.
And then I sank and then I came up again.
Was it good was it?
?
I came up when I sank.
He came up when he sank .
Just as well innit?
Yeah.
Came up when he sank.
Went in the jacuzzi.
Nice and warm was it?
hot,eight eighty degrees.
Oh good.
We had an hour and a half in there.
Well we had to queue to get in.
Yeah dad said on the phone.
 
It's lab labour intensive isn't it?
Probably that's why that's so expensive.
But er normally we walk in.
Mm but when you think they say ooh it'll never pay for itself, god it will, people are just tr 
Well it won't.
Not wh 
Once the novelty wear off.
That won't  you, you're only gonna get  people  like on, on half term th look you've gotta try and pay for yourself over twelve months  which  
Yeah.
Yeah that's it you see 
It's very rare that a swimming pool do actually 
I mean at Stra Stradbroke are now doing a half price and of course we, we only pay, for all of us to swim on Sunday I think it was two forty something.
Well for us just going here it's thirteen pound it cost me.
Yeah.
Well now it will do you see, that's the difference.
And that's fifty P off cos over sixty, I said I'm over sixty so she knocked fifty P off.
I'm gonna try it next week.
Well  yeah we, we usually go erm
These are two fifty each to go in.
Yeah, it's a lot innit?
It's a hell of a lot  
It is for little ones, you know when you think
Hour and a half you get for that.
Mm.
See when we go normally there's no time limit, but  busy week you have a  we had the orange armbands, you, you trade your key in for an or orange armband  
Mind you hour and a half is plenty innit?
And then you've got this disk on the wall which change colours,you know 
Yeah.
Yeah.
And when your wedge comes up, and that comes up flashing orange the bloke hits an old 
Yeah well what happens if you just get in at the end of your  or a at the time before they change the band, the colours?
Well  but I mean we, we  
No cos I've seen this done before right, I mean it's over a certain time, but if you go in at the end of the time
Yeah.
and you, you, you
No for a while it's flashing  the orange.
Yeah but you don't, you never, if you get 
I know what Carl mean if you, you get  five minutes before it's up
you never get the same amount of time as anybody else.
I've always thought that's a, that's a totally unfair system.
It's best with the, what, the best way I've seen it is with a numbers disk.
Say from one till ten cos they're the early ones  and then they get a certain time, then your numbers eleven to twenty 
Yeah but what I'm saying is erm  the orange disk was flashing for a long while before the buzzer  
Yeah but it's flashing just as long for those who bought it first time round, isn't it?
Yeah.
Mm.
You still get extra, you still, you don't
Anyway it's plenty of time 
Oh of course don't forget  yester yesterday erm  they allow so many in  so you'd all be going in at the same time  
Sa oh well if it's the same time, yeah i 
in at the same time, yeah.
providing you're at the same time.
Well yesterday because of the long queue it happened that way.
Normally if you go in I suppose  normally they,bother normally see.
No I was gonna say normally if you don't, if there's no time restriction
They, they, they actually tell you  in the queue.
She'll say right   going in she'll say right  the next lot will be going in in er ten minutes to one which may be a quarter of an hour's time like, you know, so it's all timed  they don't let a few  there's a  the second go in.
Yeah, mhm.
Oh I see.
Well they have to won't they cos otherwise it'd be just
Mm.
And er it weren't uncomfortably crowded in there.
Oh no that's oh no that wasn't uncomfortably crowded.
You know I always think oh god what 
Is it clean?
Oh yeah very clean 
Oh absolutely yeah.
And I, I like the idea of the lockers and that you know
th none of the changing rooms have got erm  locks on the doors, they've got bolts on the inside obviously
Yeah.
obviously, but you, you've, you've  
Ooh 
locker.
Oh that's  
You lock your stuff in
Like Stradbroke innit?
Yeah Stradbroke's like that 
 
you get it back at that end, yeah.
Do you have like a band with a key on it?
Yeah.
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yes, that's what they do at Stradbroke.
But you just  
normally you can put that band on and swim with it.
Oh we 
Yeah 
But when, when it was busy, when it's busy

Daddy  erm you know  GrandPat told us not to go on our backs  shutes.
I went on my back on both of them.
And it wasn't too bad.
You come quick off them though if you're not wondering  if you're not watching what's happening you come off sh 
time to watch your speed , do you Robert?
No.
It was okay.
Is it like that one that was at Felixstowe, that long slopey one, is it?
No it goes right out the building.
This one goes right out the building, round and round and it drops down, phew  then it goes up.
It's a hell of a thing it is.
Cleverly designed?
And how deep's the water when you land in it?
You go under it.
You go right under.
I don't I, I go sshh and I just shoot out and then I just swim to the edge, I don't go under.
I always go under  
Even when I'm lying down.
I do, I always go under .
How do, how can you lay on your back and not go under boy?
Easy.
I lay on my back.
Yeah well you must go under when you go in the water on your back.
What?
I don't.
Have to watch you next time you ha 
See you next time in, I will.
Yeah.
Yeah I reckon he's cheating.
He only said af when we come out of there  said let's pay and go in again.
 
GrandPat did something wrong  I suppose when you went down like a  when he's lying on his back because you don't go down there very very fast.
I bloody did.
I did.
I nearly didn't come up again neither, they was coming after me they were.
I had no idea where I was the first time  
 
They went alright, Andrew went down alright.
I said to Andrew do you wanna come down with me first time ?
Aha.
No he said I'll go.
And I'd be quite  wouldn't say frightened mind  
Yeah I bet .
it's quite a thing you know, to
I've been down both of them.
Yeah.
Both lying on my back.
Yeah  the rapids.
The blue one's the  
they hooked you out the rapids twice didn't they?
Yeah .
Out of both rapids.
Did they?
Yeah.
Cos once er I mean about the s third time  the, no the first time I went in the f in the rapid that was all  
That's gotta go in the kitchen  Robert when you've finished.
Yeah.
Erm  er it was current well you just sort of sw swam round in it and you could get to the side easily.
Oh.
But the third time  they had turned it up so it kept on going big  waves so I  I missed the steps so the erm one of the lifeguards 
Gran daddy we need a new lightbulb.
Oh again.
brought, brought one of those padded things  sort of orange things and she pulled me to the steps 
Daddy daddy we need a new lightbulb.
and the second one  open which went right outside the building and came back in again  erm 
I've just hoovered in here Rebecca.
I  was going on with it, all the bumps were okay but when I was  actually inside the building again I hung on to GrandPat to get to the steps but my hand slipped so I  was going round with the current so I tried to hold on to the orange thing that they had put there but I slipped  off that  and I kept on going round  and the lifeguard gave erm me and somebody else a hoop and we both grabbed onto it
they stand outside.
and she, he pulled us to the erm steps.
all outside, all on the edge there they've got these lifeguards  in bloody weatherproof clothing  like you know
Well they have to be don't they, yeah.
they've got woo wooden poles with hooks on to hook people out cos they, you don't, once you're in that water you, you don't stop you know, you can't  decide not to go .
Well that's it you're aw 
You go.
That's like the rapids without the boat
Yeah.
it's just your body going round, you've, you go everywhere, arms, legs the lot.
It's not painful though?
Apart, unless you do it
bloody  right it is.
Cos I was trying to keep out, it's  too much for him, he's  
It can be it can be painful.
And I was trying keep, make him keep his head up.
You're kami you're kamikaze 
I was trying to keep his head up.
Cos he went over lovely, he was sitting there and I came up 
Erm daddy  
bang and cracked me leg.
the first bump you go over
Go and shut the toilet door,
the first erm hump you go over it's just a little one 
toilet Robert?
like that, whoop and then the second one  you go whoop and down a bit and it's, all the water splashes you in your face and that's the same with the fi third one.
 
Sprains your back does it?
And then the
Cor yeah 
Mm
fourth one is just like the first one.
And then the next one you come to is the last one t that actually takes you into the building.
It goes up  and straight down l and you can't stay up  erm in the water, you go straight under and you don't find yourself in the middle erm of the pool where it actually comes in you find yourself being pressed against the wall by the water pressure  
 
So how do you get out then?
He's got asthma.
You have to swim to erm
Yeah I know he's asthmatic.
have to go and have a spray.
to Dr 
you have to erm swim to the steps
Ooh

You had a good time though?

No you can't my darling, you've just had a piece of

You're not old enough to shave yet, just give your hands a good wash and don't leave a mark in the sink.
Do you think Robert needs to go to the doctor then?
Yeah if the cough doesn't improve it sounds like asthma.
Tell you who I am worried about, your dad.
Did you see his lips?
Swollen?
No well they're blue.
Blue?
That's heart isn't it?
It's a sign of bad circulation  and high blood pressure.

Absolutely.

Yes.
He might listen to it from you.

Oh maybe it might come better from you, from your mum, ah it's a bit personal.
I'll mention it to mum then.
Give her a ring tomorrow.
 

Has Christopher got his Sue?

It was on the table.
Mummy I wanted another Kit Kat.

I don't think so.
Don't think so.

Yeah.
Think Jo is three in May.
Or is it Amber?
No Jo is three in May and Amber will be 
Two  three
No Amber is two, Amber was two in December.
Cos Amber's older than Rebecca  by about erm six months.
Don't you  don't you fall out of there!
Now I'll just  Carl I think and put the  on.
Come on, out you come.
Up, there's a good girl

Thank you.
I mean she's not coming for it till two, two o'clock is she  tomorrow?
We haven't really seen anybody have we?
No.
To do much tape.
Too busy.
There's two little bits there.
We've done a bit.
Who's that?
Don't recognize her.
No.
It's a nice old day though innit?
Yeah it's lovely.
That's  really springlike, that's gonna come a terrible shock you know if er the weather turn cold.
A false spring
Yeah
we keep having these though don't we, the last three or four years.
I know we do.
Well I don't know, have we got springs now?
Perhaps this is how springs can be.
With all the greenhouse effect and everything.
Perhaps this is the new  weather  system that we've  made for ourselves.
Certainly changes.
Mm.
Feel like I should put my sunglasses on, you know.
Seeing that she's going off to sleep, I thought she'd like that little dog cos that's furry.
She's touching it.
Well if she has a good half an hour
Yeah, she needs a sleep, she's shattered, she usually has an hour at least in the morning and another hour in the afternoon.
She ain't been to sleep yet.
Probably cos the boys are back you see.
Mm.
I know.
She, she goes down no problem  when there's just erm  us at home, you know?
Sorry Robert, what did you say like?
No you weren't five.
I said  
Were you?
skateboard when I  
Perhaps he was five.
It's on red Carl.
Just about to go zooming through.
Weren't you?
 

Do you know they've got these bulldozers up the other end  up near ours.
I don't know what they're doing.
Well who's the blue van then?
I'll have a look as we go.
But they've got a digger  and erm a couple of lorries, cos I, I looked and wondered what they were doing.
But it's, they seem to be in the middle of nowhere, you know, just on a piece of road where  there wasn't really anything much happening, opposite the pub.
They might just be parking up there.
No, they've got a st they've got the diggers moving backwards and forwards, yeah.
Practising.
Couldn't see what they were doing though.
That's hot this mint, innit?
Lovely.
Yeah.
Come on!
We can't go yet Andrew, the lights are on red.
Is that Harriet behind R Andrew?
Pardon?
They don't know Harriet.
No behind.
Yes it is.
What did you say?
Is that Harriet?
Yes.
What Harriet ?
What's the matter?
Oh it's alright .
Panic over.
She's nine isn't she, Harriet?
Ten she is.
Ten.
She's one of your third years though isn't she?
Who is it?
Can I do that?
Sorry?
Hire.
that's all.
Oh they're digging the road up, what a surprise.
They always dig up the road though.
Where was that bungalow that you said was for sale then?
You said oh that's, that's, that's on the way, on the outskirts of Fram  in a close or something.
I still like these here, they're too near Terry though.
Don't suppose they'd be big enough either would they, for us now?don't ru run over Mrs  
It's not her.
Isn't it?
It looked like her from the back.
Daddy you know the 
Pardon?
You know the rough 
Yeah.
skateboard?
Some of that has worn off.
It's all smooth.
Oh it will do as er  you use it really.
You don't use it that much now though do you?
Interested in other things now.
Nice to see him reading.
Yeah it was.
I thought that.
Well we'll try and get some  erm  we'll look down, the next time I'm down the library and look and see if they've got any  Enid Blyton because that might just be a way in.
She was very unfashionable at one time but I remember reading and enjoying her books.
Yeah.
Alright, she might not  have the most fantastic 
imagination but, for a plodder, it might be erm  the right kind of book.
No I think you know when this family come out, they come out in force.
I know.
Think it's one out they're all out.
Er they're, they're all sort of in into erm  inter-rela yes , they're all inter-related though aren't they?
Carl!
They have to give way Sue.
I know but she  she wasn't going to then.
Erm  only erm  cos Stacey's always with them you know.
Well  yeah like you say they're all inter- related.
But erm I think 
They're all 
think she's a niece, from what I can gather.
Yeah they're all cousins  
Dad told me, I can't remember what relation she is but she's a relation to them anyway.
But she spends nearly all her time with them.
Oh.
I think she's a pretty child, Stacey.
She's got very  very pretty eyes.
Mummy
What?
will you remember me in a second?
Why?
No just say yes.
Oh yes  here, when you were laughing.
Will you remember in an hour?
Yes.
How could I
Will you remember me in an hour?
Yes, how could I forget?
Will you remember me in a week?
Yes.
Will you remember me in a year?
Yes.
Will you remember me in a million years?
Yes.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
You've see you've forgotten me already!
you've forgot who I am already .
You should say 
Hello Robert, shouldn't I?
Yes you should say hello Robert.
I knew that one.
You didn't know that!
I did know that.
No 
Oh look!
All the bales, they weren't there the other day.
What, these?
Well if they were, oh unless he's uncovered them.
These have been here for  months 
 
Sue.
Well perhaps we didn't come this way then the other day.
  
Anyway they're nice old bales though, I wouldn't mind a few of them.
Well I was looking out the other side cos I was trying to work out where Glynis lived.
You were looking at the lambs.
We didn't come this way, Glynis doesn't 
Oh that's right.
live along this side.
No she doesn't does she?
So you're not even in the right place.
That explains why I couldn't see where she lived.
That's correct.
That's quite nice  tiles again though.
Yeah, nice house.
It makes you think of summer dunnit?
You know you look out and see the sunshine and the illusion of warmth  cos you're, we're in the car.
It's warm in the car.
Yeah.
Be nice in the summer and just put  instead of doing her up in all these great big snowsuits, you know?
Yeah.
Just put a little sunfrock and T-shirt and that hat on, which I know she won't keep on.
Yeah.
And sandals  and no socks, that'll be lovely.
I hope by then that I'll have her, you know, that she'll be dry.
In fact I had thought once she gets over this erm tooth coming through  that I might erm start trying to potty train her.
Mhm.
See if she's interested, you know, to see if she's ready.
I got a few little pairs of knickers there, I'd have to get her some more though.
Yeah?
Good idea.
I ought to start, really  really and truly I ought to start buying them in now in sort of double, double packs, you know, get two  cos they're expensive to buy.
Sort of three pounds for a couple of little, little pairs of knickers and that and that's a lot when you think they  when she first starts she's gonna be getting through seven or eight  pairs a day .
I know.
You know, you, you sort of think well   have to have plenty in.
I've got some up in the suitcase which I can use but  Oh I, I'll have a look.
I, I still like the Ladybird ones best, they wash nice.
Andrew I will remember you  remember you in the weeks  all the weeks
you know what?
I would open the door and I would say look that's Andrew.
Half an hour later Christopher comes up with a joke.
That's one way of getting the joke,yes .
Yeah.
Have you got anywhere t 
What's that black paper up there for mummy?
Where?
There, on the window.
Oh somebody took all our lovely parking ticket display off that was keeping the tas tax disk up  and replaced it with black tape.
It was either Nan or GrandPat.
Who was it?
I don't know.
Probably your dad.
Yeah.
I never did it.
Oh I know you didn't do it.
Open your window a little bit Robert, let some fresh air into the back.
It's nice
Bit more.
ain't it?
Or even isn't it.
That's it.
Good lad.
Speak posh sometimes.
We never did afford our meal did we?
We gaily thought oh yes we'll have enough money to pay for  a meal .
we can't afford it now .
Never mind.
Maybe we should earmark  perhaps my birthday, to go out.
Arrange it in advance you know?
Mm.
I don't like the thought of anybody else  come to babysit though personally.
No  but
I know people keep saying oh we'll do it for you but 
We'll do it,we yeah I know.
Well the thing is if I arrange it for May I can ring er talk to mum and see if she'll do it
Yeah.
and do it that way.
I don't know what day my birthday's on this year.
Oh it's still Christopher's birthday anyway  didn't mean to start talking about mine, only as a means for having a meal out.
 

Oh whee!
Mind if he's coughing like that  erm  don't know.
Don't suppose I'd get in the surgery tomorrow now.
If it's just a cough to go with the cold then there's nothing they can do anyway, but if it's an asthmatic cough then I can give him some erm  Ventolin.
That's what he's had before.
He is wheezier but 
He's had it for a week.
Mind I hadn't noticed.
I must be a terrible mother, I just haven't noticed.
You're used to it.
Well  He doesn't get them quite as frequently now though as he did.
No.
Not quite cos I mean at one time, when he was Christopher's age  god he was never free from cold was he?
We'd have a respite of about a fortnight if we were lucky before he went down with the next one.
Yeah 
In fact I remember I took him out of school for nearly three weeks to try and 
Get rid of  the bro 
ge get his health  yeah 
bronchial infection that he had.
Yeah, that's right.
And also because I didn't think they were doing that much there with him anyway.
I reckon he learnt more in that three weeks at home than he ever did there.
Yeah.
ring up  make an appointment for Dr .
He's sometimes easier to get into.
Chris hasn't been too bad though, his ears have been reasonable.
Is he still on medicine or not?
Well it's there.
I stopped, I stopped using it, I must admit.
Why?
Well it made him drowsy for one thing, it kept knocking him out.
And er  he could hear me perfectly well.
I thought well it's there for next time.
Soon as th there's any  slightest hint of hearing loss I can  .
In a way though, perverse though it sounds, I'd rather let it get fairly bad and take him back
Mhm.
because it's only by that way that  if, if he's gonna need the grommets or something in his ear  then he really needs to get it sorted out this year.
Yeah.
I don't want him to start in the January and then have to be off school for three weeks because 
Mm.
he's got to go to hospital to have his ears done and things like this, you know?
If it's gonna plague him and give him trouble let's get it sorted out this year, even if it means that he has a little bit of temporary deafness  for a little while, you know?
Oh dear  
Mummy what's the erm  water tower near the erm 
I don't know what you mean Robert.
Oh erm  jumbo.
Jumbo.
What's the erm   cinema next to the ?
It's not a cinema it's the Mercury Theatre.
Where you saw the pantomime?
Yeah.
It's the Me 
forgotten the name of it.
That's the Mercury.
It's a nice theatre that.
What was here before they put these up Carl?
I can't remember, or was it just  a bit of ground?
Mm.
Wonder if Tamsin had any luck selling her house.
What I don't understand  is when erm  she jumped into the beauty parlour door, how did erm  change so quickly?
Change clothes.
It was somebody else Robert who was in there already.
Oh.
Yeah it's all  all very clever.
Yes it's what pantomime's all about.
Thinking on your feet, improvisation.
It's great.
I enjoyed doing pantomime.
Oh I wasn't a very convincing Prince Charming though,don't think I'd do it again .
You did your best, had a go.
Had a go.
Wasn't me.
I'm better backstage, I'm better writing things and  than on the st on the stage.
I'm not enough of a strutter  anyway.
Oh you've gotta be a poser.
Oh I, I enjoy 
You did okay.
You  
I did it.
Well I, I enjoyed it when I was at college, I used to enjoy drama there.
Not the same as putting on a big performance though is it?
No it's a bit different.
When you put the  and that's the difference about drama at college is you're doing it to please yourself  and the, the group that you're in with and  ultimately I suppose your tutor  but when you do something like a pantomime when you're doing it to please the punters 
Yeah.
I think the bravest thing I ever did in my life was sing solo at that pantomime, I, I think that was braver than giving birth or  having my wisdom teeth out .
I think you sang quite well.
The bravest thing I ever did.
You sang quite well for
It's one of m it's one of my  me memories I've erm  hidden, well not hidden away but tucked away  to look at in
In a later
later years, say well okay I, I haven't got  a fantastic voice but I did it and that was the bravest thing I did cos I know I haven't 
Anna's voice isn't much better.
know I haven't got a fantastic voice 
But you sang togeth you s complemented each other when you sang well together didn't you?
Yes, yeah we got on alright.
It was a good harmony.
Yeah.
But we're both too feeble by ourselves  
Yes.
I suppose you were, but together it was good.
So 
Mummy how  join the pantomime.
Well I 
She volunteered.
Mummy just said she'd have a do, she'd have a go.
Yeah, I said I'd have a go and before  I knew where I was I got   got top billing.
It was nice.
I can never understand why you took that part though.
What Prince Charming?
Yeah.
Well I was offered it and I was flattered.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
I was,i well I 
You had the talent you know.
Yeah but for a newcomer to be offered a er er offered a large part like that  you know 
Well you must have had something then Sue.
Gift of the gab  probably .
Cos cos they invited you back again if I remember rightly.
Yeah.
But I did the props er on, on the next one round and then we moved, I thought, well I was pregnant anyway.
But I used to quite enjoy the erm  the, the shows, the s the song and dance routines, they were funny.
They were the, all the older ladies and that.
We used to have a laugh there doing the chorus.
Can you see the sprayer  Chris?
Look.
I think he's asleep Carl.
Christopher.
Oh move away then.
Look.
Got all that, the chemicals floating in the car haven't you?
That's what I want.
That's what I w Oh God 
Oh look, he said, that's what I want.
Did you see it Chris?
He hasn't got a sprayer on has he?
On his tractor.
No.
Ah.
Got just about everything else.
Dee dee dee  Oh they've levelled all this off have they?
Filled it in.
Oh no, still the same.
Oh no .
Still the same.
That's where the  used to live innit?
Don't know where they live now.
They live up erm  what's it called?
Erm
but that's Peasenhall way.
I don't have much to do with them.
I'm glad to say.
 

I never  I never minded them.
It's all the  the sycophants used to hang round at the school gate 
Oh yeah, yeah 
used to get on my nerves.
she was very very ordinary and very very
Yeah, she was very na well he, he was alright 
shy when she came to our school.
She was almost lost.
Felt a bit sorry for her, you know?
Well they they were alright 
You know I said to her I said it's not what you're used to is it?
She sort of give me a
A funny look?
a wry, sick sort of smile.
Cos I, I could tell she could place me  from somewhere but  she couldn't remember where, well th I don't think, she gave the impression that she knew who I was.
But I mean I remember Terry going  they got erm   oh, you know, oohs and ahs.
No she was alright, I never minded her and I didn't really mind him.
Gone grey, you know?
Yeah but
Yeah it's, it's  isn't it?
he's alright.
No it was, it was Mrs, Mrs   I didn't like .
We used to  hanging round 
 
it's the hangers on that
Well it's all these people who say ooh no, ooh  superst they're just ordinary people.
Yeah.
There's nothing superstarish about them.
No and to be fair they've never set themselves up to be that way at all, they always wished to be one of the crowd as well .
Anyway  oh god oh I remember this bit, oh wonder how Ross is getting on.
Oh be able to practise what she preaches at long last.
Don't know any of them.
I'm glad to say.
There's the vicar.
Oh that's the vicar innit?
I remember him.
Mr 
, yeah, Reverend  yeah.
This is erm  
Robert, you used to live near here.
I knew where it was.
Terrific memory that boy's got.
I knew where it was.
Did you?
That's been for sale for some time, long as I can remember practic just imagine you'd be in the catchment area for   wouldn't that be fun, there's Jason.
Innit?
Might be,
No it's not.
We've been here before haven't we mummy?
Oh  yeah, several times Andrew.
Think of all the, all the times I trudged up here with a pushchair to get Robert to playgroup and to school.
Oh!
That's been newly sold then.
What's he got for sale?
Carrots, I think we're alright for carrots  Carl .
Freshly dug, what else?
Freshly dug carrots.
That's it.
GroBags  it's closed anyway.

Yeah that wasn't too bad, it was this part here.
But I think he's tarmacked this since I've been, no he hasn't.
That just used to be a mud pile there.
Still is.
Dreadful.
You'd get bogged down and you couldn't use the path and it was always overgrown in the summer.
No I can't say I miss this bit.
I miss me house.
Believe it or not.
But I don't miss living next door to that  peculiar man, that 
Yeah.

Oh no I wouldn't move back.
Infinitely better where we are.

Why do I always look at houses that I can't, I've got, not got the remotest chance of owning?
I don't know, for the size.
