It's more romantic I think.
Now is that ?
Swallows the atmosphere.
I think it's the candlestick.
They don't give off so much light though do they?
No.
Purely decorative.
But I think .
Oh right.
We have paper ones.
Mm mm.
But  might ignite.
We'll be  no, no, they don't ignite 
 
because the candle is inside the  shape of the candle  shape holder  that  they're more translucent.
Right.
I think, but though we've also got some nice glass

Oh that's okay.
Mm!
Delicious!
Beautiful dishes.
Mm mm!
Ma , Patrick and I were walking the dog
What's this?

Pickled , pickled ginger.
Pickled ginger.
Yes, but I thought 
Do you eat ginger?

Do you eat ginger.
Oh gosh this is absolutely 
Wonderful!
lovely!
Mm mm!
 
I've never had it before.
Mm mm.
Pick pickled ginger.
I think ginger and melon is delicious.
Mm mm.
That is beautiful!
Cos I thought it was ma , I thought it was erm  a ham or something.
Mm mm.
It's lovely!
Have you noticed her  melon-baller
Oh yes, she did.
I went through everything with her.
She was delighted with it.
Mm.
Oh did you give her a me a melon baller?
We gave her one as well, yeah.
Mm.
Cos we have one.
Oh very yum, yum.
So
They surely sell them in Dublin though do they?
I haven't seen them.
I'm sure they do, it's just 
Mm mm.
you know, it's one of those things 
Yeah.
you never think  to pick it up for yourself.
Mm.
No, exactly.
You brought a zester didn't you, for Molly?
Mm.
I think they're a good idea.
Mm mm!
Gosh this pickled ginger's delicious!
Gorgeous!
I'm hooked on ginger.
Tastes like lime.
Yeah.
Chris discovered it at Blakes.
Really?
Really?
first of all.
So what, what can you do with it?
I mean 
Just have a bit  bit with cold meat  cold meat  roast chicken
Yep.
pork
Mm mm!
Molly would love it.
So, I can have 
Yes.
And Mikey likes ginger as well 
Mm mm.
doesn't he?
Does your mother like ginger?
Mm mm.
I must give you one and take it for her.
And Michael es , and Michael especially.
Mm mm.
But
Cos I do chicken with ginger which 
Th 
is really nice.
Chicken, ginger 
Oh do you?
and cashew nuts.
Oh!
You haven't given that to me.
With root ginger or powdered ginger.
It's root ginger.
It's delicious!
Very strong.
Cos it's very subtle.
But it's in a 
Oh I 
packet is it?
It's actually very subtle.
Mhm.
It's delicious.
So many people  when they eat it, they can't actually  decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger.
Yes.
It's very subtle.
I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.
Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger  peels it 
Really?
and chops it
and puts it with a pound of  Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken  outside  it's just lightly rubbed with oil
Mm mm.
and then about two ounces of powdered ginger  sprinkled over it.
Two ounces as well as all the ginger?
And puts it into roast in the oven, and takes it out after fifty minutes  and then  you get  Philadelphia cheese and white wine  melt it down in the wine
Mm mm!
stirring a bit more  you know, crushed root ginger
Mm mm.
and that's your sauce to serve on the side.
I tell, you've never eaten anything like it!
Is it nice?
I could eat the tail.
Really?
It's gorgeous.
But i , I keep saying to Michael it's so expensive!
I mean root ginger's like a pound a pound, or two pound a pound.
No, not really.
It's not, it's not as expensive as it used to be.
It's got more and more popular strangely enough.
But she does ginger tea.
Oops.
So do I?
Oh I haven't drunk ginger tea before.
Well I'll make you ginger tea.
Well we never tried that before.
But that's sounds what, can I just ask again, so you have a roast chicken yo , and you  mix two
A pound of Philadelphia cheese.
Yeah.
But she does about two pound of root ginger.
Most normal people would have half a pound at the most.
That's two good roots.
You crush it or do you chop 
Two whole, bash it.
it up?
Bash it?
Bash, bash.
Yeah.
And you put that, mix that in 
Mix in.
with the Philadelphia 
Into the cavity.
Right.
And 
yo 
then  after 
and then 
fifty minutes
oil it, oil 
It's  
the outside
as if it's full 
Yeah.
and moist.
Put the ground,
with the 
the ground ginger
the  the 
Mhm.
you know, the powdered stuff.
Philadelphia cheese cooked in and 
Cheese and everything inside.
keeping the whole chicken .
Mm.
Mm.
And then roast it.
And then after fifty minutes you do the  melt the
She, well she cooks her chicken for only fifteen minutes, but I would cook my chicken 
Oh.
longer.
Yeah.
Are we talking about a roast, a whole chicken?
A ro , a whole chicken.
Mm.
Fifteen minutes?
Fifty.
Fifty.
Oh fifty.
That's still pretty short 
Mm.
It 
isn't it?
it's about an hour and a half to cook a chicken.
But 
Mm.
you could cook, you could cook it 
 
for longer with that inside couldn't you?
Fifty, fifty and I wouldn't want to eat it.
Right.
Couldn't you?
It's very moist.
I don't like overcooked chicken.
I like it
But that'd be pink?
Do you like it pink?
So , surely 
Mm.
yeah, it'll still be pink.
I thought you had to be quite careful with chicken.
Well, you're not gonna be  
Well we only ever use Marks and Spencers  free range chicken.
We  we used to have these in Dublin didn't we?
Can we give this dog 
Yeah.
some chickens?
Oh don't!
I'll have to try that one in, in Dublin, tell Molly I've been.
That sounds wonderful!
It's still a good thing to try.
Yeah, we do a  well of course we,we used to make contact with who, were having a dinner party that we went to.
That's why we do all our entertaining   one at a time.
Why do you only use Marks and Spencers' chickens.
Sheila says they're the best in England.
Really?
She won't have anything else in the hotel.
If there's a chicken dish in the hotel  chickens don't come from our suppliers, they come from Marks and Spencers.
Do Marks and Spencers 
So you just freeze them do you?
obviously you get them then from  in bulk from 
I just .
No.
What you just go to the supermarkets and buy  a whole of chickens?
Mhm.
Really?
That's our extravagance.
Excuse me, er, for a moment.
Mm.
Well she thinks they're far superior to anybody 
Can I help you?
else's.
Yeah.
The napkins
Mm mm!
are napkins that we've been buying in antique fairs.
Have you?
Are they really?
Mm.
Yeah.
They were wonderful!
So you probably think 
I think 
they starch them though.
Oh well I have them ordered.
Mm.
We have them ordered.
Are they nice?
They are beautiful!
Yeah.
They really are lovely.
We got about a hundred napkins  upstairs .
Really?
Yeah.
The napkins to  well cheaper than buying new ones isn't it?
Mm mm!
Yes.
Mm.
You get them for two pounds fifty.
Four pounds.
Five pounds each.
They're wonderful aren't they?
You go to Peter  and pay that for an ordinary
Mm mm.
Oh yeah.
what d'ya call it, kind of 
Mm.
I  just thought that was absolutely delicious!
Dave  has a gorgeous recipe for erm  Teriyaki beef.
On the menu of Biggs.
Oh what's 
Really?
that?
She puts the  pickled ginger on one side  and  another, like a  Japanese horseradish called  Wasabe which is green  don't try it, it'll blow your head off!
Really?
Oh yeah.
And th , the, the sort of steak is then it's er cooked like soya sauce 
Oh yeah.
and marinated
Mm mm!
then it's served in strips.
Just delicious!
Is, is it expensive to eat Biggs?
 
Really?
Mm.
Oh I was just thinking, it'd be nice to go there.
I didn't think it would be
The starters are about nine pounds to  in at thirty five for caviar.
Really?
Main courses are about eighteen to  twenty eight.
And the puddings make about sixty pounds.
So it's sixty pounds each 
Mm.
then?
Yeah.
And that's for the 
Plus your booze.
Yeah.
Mm.
And is the drink very expensive?
Ya.
Her mark-up is about  so what I normally do, she has never ever told me to pay for anything.
And she says go and have a meal 
Oh yeah.
then
Yeah.
you know, and if anybody else does, they do  but I always insist on paying for my drinks.
Yeah.
And
Thank you.
Which one?
she obviously didn't know this for a long time  and then one day I said to her, well, it was lovely meal and all that but I do think your mark-up on the wine is scandalous!
What did she say?
Of course I get a staff discount.
Really?
She says well  I know, and you know that that bottle of wine costs
Mm mm.
ten ninety five  and, and we had two bottles last night so  it costs us sixty pounds.
Well done Michael.
Who's making Gearoid pay?
Nobody makes me pay for it, I always pay for my drinks.
Really?
So it was murder!
Really?
I said I would never go back again
I'll help you Michael.
No, I'll, I'll do it, it's okay.
I'm all under control 
Are you sure?
now.
She wouldn't let me pay for it.
Really?
So fair to say, the staff are depending on their tips to supplement their salary
Yeah.
so if I don't pay anything
Yeah.
they've lost that
Yes.
Right.
ability of earning that money
Yeah.
 
, so
You can't leave a tip regardless?
Well , Michael always leaves a tip.
Mm.
But what we've done now  they've agreed to let me pay  and I pay cost price for the drinks.
Right.
So we can drink ourselves silly and get a bill for about ten pounds.
And all that wonderful food!
Oh that's very good isn't it?
I'm looking forward to the  sweet I must 
Mm.
say.
Mm.
Thank you for dinner.
Maybe Thursday.
Have you got a busy week now Michael?
Well Tuesday is my busiest day.
I'm getting 
What?
some more in.
Oh really?
Yeah.
That's alright.
Cos they're around then?
Yeah.
And how long are yours away for?
Too long.
Monday morning, four A M they landed.
Oh!
So you'll have a  an awful week then as usual?
Well I'm hoping I'm going to have a nice week but it  Mavis , my housekeeper's away until Wednesday  so I can't leave the house  during the day.
Oh right.
Because the morning maid goes home at one o'clock  and doesn't come back again until six.
the gardener comes.
Yes.
I can't just go off and have a look for somebody or
Mm mm.
go wandering down the high street can I?
Or whatever.
No.
Mm mm.
So Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I fully intend to .
Cos I never ever have time off.
I know, you said before you hardly miss a lunch.
Never.
Which is crazy!
I mean, I really do resent it sometimes.
I'm not surprised.
Yes.
Cos it's dark in the morning when I go into work and it's dark when I'm going home in the evenings.
It's getting a bit ridiculous!
It's getting .
And does provide food for you to have?
Occasionally.
I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me?
That's it.
That's appalling though!
And on , on erm  Thursday  Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark  she came home at  just about half one.
She came and made me a ham sandwich  and the maid just look at her   to eat it now.
Brilliant!
There really was not a scrap of .
That's awful!
Because the housekeeper  sorts all that out, so when she's away no one does it?
But she bought all these things for me from Marks and Spencers, you know breaded chicken and
Mm mm.
Mm.
breasts.
Yeah.
I put them all in the deep freeze.
Unless you think about it, you know the day before  or the 
Yeah 
Yeah.
morning you come in.
But surely you can just defrost it in the microwave?
She doesn't have a microwave.
Does she not?
Why doesn't she use a 
She doesn't like them.
microwave?
Doesn't like them.
But she bought you one.
She get you one.
That was quite funny because  it was our first Christmas down there  and I was saying to the housekeeper that I  I wouldn't mind having people come and stay and    not a problem because we've got a lovely cooker  and we're going to bring our microwave down from .
Said it's electric, I'm just going to unplug it and bring it down and put it on the work top.
The only thing is that it's chocolate brown and my kitchen's all white.
And she did and so  I think  two days before Christmas Lady  said to me, okay  I shall go into Peter  and choose whatever microwave you want.
Just charge it to my account.
That's right.
What?
She said well  you can't be carrying microwaves around England every time you want to have a meal.
And just, I know that's what, you haven't got one in the cottage and  there you are, go and get it.
She's so generous isn't she?
Yeah.
There was no kind of 
 
pricing mentioned.
I went to Peter 
and looked at, you know, little ones, and huge ones
Oh yeah.
and things that did that thing and washing up and all the rest 
 
and I thought what am I going to do?
Mm mm.
Cos I mean I wasn't with her that long.
Mm.
It was like my first Christmas.
And what was considered acceptable and what was considered being bloody greedy!
Yeah .
I said to the guy, how many of these could I actually walk out with?
And he said none.
They're all display models?
I said what have you got in the so , you know, warehouse on Sloane Avenue  in 
Mm.
white?
Oh I think that was one of two.
The other one was like four hundred and ninety nine pounds.
So, I'll take it.
I didn't know, I didn't even know what I was taking.
Really?
I still haven't a clue of what er the
the pamphlet, it's far too complicated for me.
She's like that.
I mean, she's really sweet.
Mm mm.
I'm very careful never  to admire things or enthuse about things.
Because she's likely to give them to you?
Because she's likely to give them to you.
I mean, she knows I love Gardenia
Mm mm.
and because she was in  Mustique  and hadn't bought me a birthday present  she made sure that there were two Gardenia plants at the party that night she bought me.
Really?
She's like that.
Mm.
She knows we love the pink champagne.
Mm mm.
The brand is in.
And it's not  kind of standard champagne in the place  but she always keeps a supply.
Always has champagne.
Got any champagne at home?
Get another bottle of that.
He must be running low.
You see I, I mean I know obviously the perks don't outweigh all that, er, at least you do get some perks.
At least you know, she can be generous and 
Yes.
But she can be absolutely demonic  there's no doubt about that.
She really can.
Mm.
And she drives you insane!
Well like you said last time, I think only a man can put up with her.
Mm.
That's probably why she got through so many women.
I think she's on back on the right track as well with her.
She was in a rut.
Okay.
Really?
There is more to life than  worrying about how the maid's ironed your  nightdress or  you know.
So she does have a housekeeper that lives in?
No.
Now Molly's been with her since she first got married, you know.
She's a big Portuguese man-of-war.
And then she has a  maid?
Who's very bitter.
Is she?
Why 
Well 
is she bitter?
well she's had a miserable life of her own kind of thing.
She's not married?
Doesn't like Sir Mark.
Her husband left her.
Oh.
Doesn't like Sir Mark.
I think resents him enormously.
He doesn't like her.
Oh really?
Because, you know, I understand that  before he came along she was there  you know, and that kind of situation
Yeah.
Yeah.
where    you know, well it never used to be like that.
Is it 
Mm mm.
her first marriage then?
This is the original
what?
Lady ?
Yeah.
Third.
Oh third!
Really?
I didn't know that.
Number one was killed in a car crash?
Really?
And her, their children were not  two and three years of age.
Oh how awful!
And the same week  that he was killed, Sasha, her daughter was in  Great Ormond Street  having surgery for cancer of the brain.
That's appalling!
So 
So she must have been quite young herself then?
Oh ya.
She married at eighteen.
So yo , I have enormous respect for anyone who actually 
Mm mm.
through something like 
And so 
that.
she just divorced the second one?
Kind of a  touchy subject.
Oh right.
He's Phil , the theatrical producer.
Got all these smash hits in the West End  at the moment.
But, I don't know what the story is.
No one has ever said.
Any more.
On the rare occasion that it comes up she kind of laughs it off and says well it wasn't really a marriage.
And just change the subject.
So I  could of been days 
Oh.
literally.
Yeah.
So sh 
Well Sir Marquess  across the road  it was his first wife who died of a brain tumour and left him with three daughters, as we know.
Oh really?
.
But it was almost inevitable.
So where are all the children now?
.
They have one son  by this alliance and he's the youngest.
Ah but they're all  young adults.
Oh so they all do their own thing?
So the girl that had 
Ah yeah.
Ah yeah.
the girl that had cancer 
Mm mm.
she's alright now?
She's fine.
Sasha's great!
Works at length.
And are they nice people?
Sasha's lovely.
Adorable.
Her brother is .
Really?
But I think that finally .
Use all these potatoes?
We certainly do.
Yes, it that a joke Michael?
I think he just well  they've got pots of money between them why should I ever do any work?
Let them pay for everything, which they do.
His daughter's loathe her!
Really?
Although I think the elder one  her 
 
but the youngest one is really giving her a  attack at the moment.
She's just  come out of Saint Mary's   didn't do as well as she thought, or everybody else hoped she would do in her A levels, so is now retaking one.
And she's just  an evil little so and so!
I hate to say that about anybody, but she really is.
Yeah.
She conspired to be  disruptive.
She's a liar.
An out and out liar!
Really?
And I think she's stealing stuff as well.
She's what?
She's got a huge allowance!
She's stealing stuff?
Stealing stuff.
From the house.
Does she still live at the home then?
Erm  officially yeah.
But
You know that  erm  these people Chiddyfort where mum and dad are living  and erm
Which people ?
Oh yeah.
And they had fostered  a girl  because they couldn't have any children of their own as far as I know  and  and, ah they  she's a com , a complete horror!
I mean, she's only about eighteen  and she, she hates 
She's got married now though.
she hates the parents.
Yeah I know.
And even about the wedding dress  her mother, her mother knew 
But she's calmed down a lot.
her mother knew, her mother that
Oh God!
if she, if she admired this dress
That one ?
Thank you very much.
Yes.
That she wouldn't say anything so, Dorothy had to actually say  erm  well I really don't think you should go for that.
That's awful!
And the daughter said, right I'll have that one.
But I think they are getting on better now though.
She was such a bitch!
Unbelievable!
This just, just looks absolutely wonderful Michael?
Look at the little carrots and everything.
This is gorgeous!
There.
Is this the chicken that I saw earlier transformed into little breaded
Yes it is.
And the breadcrumbs done by Michael.
He's a wonderful little treasure isn't he?
Have they got, have the breadcrumbs got herbs in?
Yes.
Taste.
Alright.
Mm mm!
It's ooh!
They're actually MacDonalds MacNuggets.
 
 
I've thrown the box away.
Mm..
They're absolutely wonderful!
But tell me
Shall I tell you what that's covered with?
It's actually a stuffing mix
Mm mm!
that  you can buy here  you can actually get it in Harrods as well, and I use as breadcrumbs.
It's absolutely gorgeous!
Mm mm!
There's more gravy here.
Anybody?
Mm.
Just a little.
Mm.
Right.
This is a delicious meal Michael.
Thank you very much.
It's really super!
It's wonderful!
It's only chi chicken.
The chicken is just
Is it?
gorgeous!
Mm mm.
And with a  of course the vegetables.
Lovely vegetables!
Mm mm!
Gosh!
You've done very well Michael!
I don't take any gravy so have a bit more.
Do you not?
Do you want some  Michael?
Have you had some?

At the moment.
Okay.
Don't you like gravy?
That's it.
Wo!
Thank you.
She's had enough.
Mm.
She'll have had
Mm.
Anything else?
No.
Oh I, it could be on, I can't see the red light now, it's gone the other side.
I hope we weren't discussing what I thought we were discussing on that 
Mm mm.
 
tape  or you really have to wipe it out.
 
 
I Know.
Mm mm.
Cos names 
The tape ran out during Blind Date.
Mm mm.
names were named.
Mm mm.
 
Do you have it on during Blind Date.
Oh my God !
That could really lower the tone of the evening.
You had your day.
Well I didn't tell you about my  hot date on Wednesday.
 
Ooh!
I didn't know you had one.
Tell me.
Tell us.
You know I had the choir concert last Saturday?
Mhm.
It was at a church in Hertford.
And we were completely frozen cos the boiler had broken down and we were there at two o'clock to rehearse.
And  I had one rehearsal of two Bach pieces which were really difficult  and I was com , feeling completely frantic during the break in rehearsal, and went over  to look at the music  and some fellow called Don bounded over to me  and said, oh you can't be  you know you sh can't be looking at that now, ba, la dee da dee da!
He must have heard that I'd come back from  Ireland.
So, he was talking about Ireland, really raving about it and  his name's Kennedy and  he's from Liverpool and he likes to think he's got Irish blood in him, he's been there twice this year and
Mhm.
all that.
Really enthusing about it.
So we were chatting away about that.
And then erm  after the rehearsal  some of us went off to get a pizza  before the concert  and he said to me, erm  are you interested in going to hear the  Mozart Requiem, it's on at the Barbican on Wednesday?
So I said, yeah!
Co , I've always wanted to hear it, and as you know it's our next concert.
So erm  that was fine, until  after the concert
Was that a subsidised concert by  were all the tickets one price or not?
At the Barbican?
I don't know.
It was packed!
Princess Diana was there.
I know.
That's it.
Really.
She was?
She was there when you were there?
Mm.
Mm, I saw her.
Mm.
Oh really?
All the tickets were 
Mm mm.
one price.
I had heard 
What was she wearing?
it was sponsored.
I read it in the 
Black and white.
paper and thought   well that would have been quite nice.
Mm mm.
Did you go with him?
I'll come to that.
You said yes did anyway.
I said yes thinking Mozart would be lovely, and not thinking any more of it  until he stuck to me like a limpet
for the rest of the  concert and  the penny began to drop  erm  He said something about the tube station not being the most romantic place to meet  and I kind of brushed it off by saying well at least we won't get wet there or something.
Mm mm.
And then he said er, I said to him about 
I've got to get the last train home.
He said don't worry, I have the winter timetable.
He's a train spotter.
He's got a green anorak with toggles 
I see.
on.
And 
I think it's better
Don't!
Alright.
He's tall but 
 

he's tall which is great.
No problem.
He's in his  well actually probably pushing forty at this stage.
But, he's got  he's got a a big round red face  and little eyes 
and a moustache, and the most peculiar little  bit under 
Bit, yes.
there.
But really it's just like 
What colour hair has he got?
it's just, it's just like a bit like that
But he's nice?
which goes  Mm mm!
But I kept hearing him like scrape it during the concert.
I know .
But it 
What col 
It's ju 
What colour hair?
Erm
Does it matter?
When you have a   lobotomy !
Especially when he's
I don't know
.
Michael , Michael 
Oh no .
Michael's  hair colour I suppose.
A bit like that.
And then he's got  he's got a beard, except it's not very long  going behind his jawline like Captain Ahab.
Do you remember?
What?
Yes.
Yeah.
Kind of, out like that.
Really bizarre!
Weird.
Peculiar man.
He's head of  er he's senior editor of classics at E M I, so he latched onto this sort of, you know
Ah.
ooh another thing in common, you know  da da, da da.
And did you 
So erm  I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's  reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music.
So I thought, oh maybe I'm  reading too much into it.
So I met him on Wednesday evening  Tottenham Court Road tube station  and er  chat, chat, chat.
He, he talked so much we missed our stop.
In a very loud voice!
Did you?
Yes.
Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me!
Oh oh!
Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on 
Oh yeah.
that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him  and I did not fancy him in the least  erm, it really made my skin crawl.
And erm  first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching
Mm mm.
and moving away, like, hint, hint.
But he liked gripped me on the arm and then  his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright?
. Oh it was just a nightmare!
I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this.
But, you know  I think it, I thought it was his  dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath.
It was, I don't know how it smelt 
 
of moth balls.
And he kept guffaw and going,
and get this awful blast of moth balls !
Really?
It was, it was a complete nightmare !
Oh.
And I, I wasn't prepared
I wasn't prepared for   for it at all 
Go on.
because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving  and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we?
And I pulled away and I said, well erm  I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it.
Hint!
Hint!
I mean what could I do?
And then as we approached the tube station the arm around me again and erm  and he 
But was he a fellow choir man as well?
Yes!
It's awful you see because it's so 
I would have been, been very rude to him.
But no, but I can't  couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir.
Well in future whenever he suggests something  I think what you've got to do 
There's some in here.
Okay?
I've got  two here.
is never  you know, join the breaks or whatever  and just make sure  you're not left alone 
Mm.
you're with other girls.
Well, I'm sorry, he just came on so strong.
Mm.
And, so I was forced into lying.
I said erm  I've enjoyed the concert but I'm afraid 
Yeah.
a , er you know, I don't want there to be any.
misunderstanding, and he, he said explain.
So I had to lie.
Certainly.
and I said erm, I'm going out with someone.
Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far.
Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un , misunderstanding?
And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it  and embarrassed both of us 
Ha.
so   there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man?
Said oh  I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this .
Well er, January, I think.
Mm.
Yes, about ten months  I suppose .
This phantom.
 
 
Of the opera.
And erm  oh he was, oh very lucky man!
Blah, blah, blah.
I had high hopes of us.
Ooh he kept, but he kept  I'd even worked out my train to, from Ealing down to
Oh no!
erm , Strawberry Hill.
Blah, blah, blah!
I'm sorry but I just think that is outrageous!
Well I know.
So presumptuous.
Say, because I'm meeting someone that he'd plan out his 
Mm mm.
his route.
He said, I hope I'm not embarrassing you but I believe in being frank.
Blah, blah.
And then to my horror 
 
er erm  we changed to Embankment and he was supposed to go on the district line over to Ealing
Yes.
And I was going down to Waterloo for my train 
Mm.
he said erm  do you mind if I travel to Richmond with you?
Oh!
What could I say?
I mean no was ringing in my ears but I couldn't say that.
I mean, yes, I do mind.
Erm  so  we walked in and out of carriages  as he  sought a pair of seats together  and erm  squashed down, he had me like penned into the window, like I've got my bag and my umbrella in between ha , and I'd already told him I was going out with someone.
He was going like that to my face.
Like, I really felt abused.
I mean at the time
Ya.
I felt sorry for him but  I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it.
That's  
The next 
isn't it?
the next time you see the girls in the choir 
I'll bet they'll turn round and say 
Well I, er, he ca , he was, he was then 
be careful of whatever his name is.
he was then saying erm  now what about a concert this Friday?
Erm, there's such and such going on.
And there's one er  a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm  I'm away those weekends.
I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend 
Yeah, let's not.
and he said erm  have you got your diary with you?
And I said no.
And he said, hadn't you better check?
And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm  I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way.
I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound?
I said, I'll see you at choir.
But we don't get to see each other at the choir  
erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill.
I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm  pressure!
Pressure.
Pressure.
Pressure.
Crowding me in.
And then he said 
Then it's , it's better to have a two-timer from 
then he said I'm lonely.
Marks and Spencers.
 
A lot easier to handle.
Sorry Rachel.
And then
No .
he said that  
I did that for your sister's benefit.
I'm not a loner, I'm lonely.
He said, I haven't had a relationship since nineteen eighty.
I was married for a couple of years in the seventies.
Poor woman 
I've got 
probably committed suicide!
I'm sorry.
He hasn't had a relationship since nineteen
Yeah.
eighty?
Did I forget to mention that?
Well, I'm sorry, the girls at work just fell about laughing.
Nineteen eighty?
Nineteen eighty.
And I said, oh I'm sure there's someone 
You ought to join Dateline or something.
I said I'm there's somewhere out there for you.
And he was obviously  really furious that  I'd said that .
And I thought, yeah well I know I'd be cross if  someone said to that me but I don't give a toss actually .
You should suggest that he join 
 
Dateline and  he sounds awful  
We'll, we'll put him on Blind Date.
Shall we nominate him?
Yeah .
And can you believe it  erm
I don't believe  .
Thursday night I was living in dread of the choir.
And I trundling along the district line to the Embankment across to Sloane Square  and then hello, hello, I didn't expect to see you here.
Oh oh!
I never met anyone on the tube before from choir.
And I'm sure my face was a picture.
I was just 
 
appalled!
I was just thinking about what a horrendous evening it had been the night before and then he 
 
confronted me 
with his awful beard and everything.
Oh I dunno.
Is there anyone in 
And I had 
the choir that lives near you, or  sca , can travel with you?
Actually there's Paul, the guy who'd given me a lift to the concert and, and he mentioned going to the  , the film I saw, erm  but I knew he was going to the pub, he always goes to the pub afterwards.
So I pa , I told one girl in the choir what had happened, and I think to begin 
And what did she say?
with she thought I was overreacting cos she didn't really  respond.
Is she married or what?
And then , she is married.
Er erm  and then later on I, I, I think maybe she did realize, you know, cos I said  I wasn't prepared for that and that hasn't happened before.
I didn't want to think, her to think that I was a show-off, you know 
Yes.
oh I have fun with men all the time, chasing them and that.
Mm mm.
In my dreams!
And  er er 
 
she, she said to me on the way o , er as I was  I said look I'm going to  scoot now and she said well I hope you don't get any unwanted company on the way back.
And I really felt on edge walking back to 
Mm mm.
the tube station cos I expected him to spring out 
Well, that's my point you see.
from erm, an alleyway or 
But that man does live near you that can give you a lift.
I know, but then I, I'd have 
Yeah but you'd also have 
to endure the pub with  the other  with Don.
I know.
Well I think the next time you just  I mean, go home  by yourself next time, you know  if there was a   I think you've got to make a point of  of  you know, not being alone with 
Mm mm.
somebody like that around.
Mm.
He's obviously obsessive.
Mm!
He's not listened to a word you've said.
See he's been married before 
He said to me 
as well.
I mean 
he said to me  on the train to Richmond 
erm
Stop!
there may well be someone in, in the wings but that's irrelevant to me.
I'll ignore that, I'm in with a chance.
.
I think if you feel like that 
Well there's no way, no way of there being 
what's his excuse?
Yes.
Ya.
Cos he, he's being rude to you.
He has totally insulted you.
So I wouldn't feel at all embarrassed.
I mean, sod the choir!
Okay, you're in the same choir
Sod the choir!
but he doesn't own it.
Plenty of choirs.
He's not going to get you kicked out of the choir.
If anything, he should be kicked out if he's like that.
Mm.
Any new girl that comes along is gonna get him leching after her.
Who's the choir leader?
Er th , we have a conductor called Andy , who is our  guest conductor.
Alright.
But is there nobody like erm
you know like an orchestra leader?
There isn't er, there isn't somebody who's sort of responsible for coordinating the choir, the choir leaders?
There's a chairman.
Bu , you know there's a committee with a chairman.
But we all get changed in the same room when we're at concerts.
And he's  .
What, men and women together?
Yes!
I know, I was appalled that  Saturday.
Oh God !
And obviously 
The only other
maybe I'm misjudging but maybe he was observing .
 
I feel totally embarrassed .
I feel awful!
God they've got 
I , you're too polite though.
I wouldn't be as polite as you are.
Just tell him to bugger off!
Yeah I would've done too.
Get one of those erm  attack
Rape alarm 
Rape 
things, yeah.
rape alarms.
And just bleep that when he comes  near you .
 
Yes.
Absolutely .
Honestly!
Rape !
Yeah.
Honestly!
Attempted rape !
You know, if he starts creating a scene then you say that retched thing has gone off again in my bag.
 
 
You know, d'ya know what I mean?
Just startle him.
Mm.
Cos then you're not going to be   
Cos if he's not being put off by a boyfriend which most men would.
Mm.
Well if needs 
Mm!
be, I mean I  Gearoid will turn up.
Gearoid.
Are you nominating ?
And I'll play the boyfriend.
He's nominated Gearoid.
I'll leave my handbag at home.
 
 
Or I'll , or I'll turn up
Oh God !
No it's really sweet of you 
No what, perhaps what you should do is
Mm.
one of you should go and pick her up
That's what I'm saying.
Mm.
from the choir one night and you can say to him  oh my boyfriend's picking me up and then see how .
Or you, bring me over and introduce me.
Mm.
And I'll say 
 
you know, I'll say thank you for taking Anna-Marie to, to the Mozart concert.
Mm.
I'll have to do it
But I think she was very .
 
It was really, it was really , it was really very helpful to her  at her choir and her practice that night.
Er erm
Yes, cos I'm gonna have to make up some
rubbish about
Seeing him.
see my boyfriend isn't too interested in concerts
and that's why I've enjoyed coming out this evening.
And here, here am I, and then I'll say  you know of course I  you know I'm indebted to you because I realize that, you know, Anna-Marie is quite prepared to go out with other men if she wants to 
 
but I like  and make sure it's alright.
 
I'm actually going to join in the choir.
You'll be able to take her  
 
I can't even have a 
.
.
Anna-Marie's  told me so much about it .
And can you tell me the ta , time of trains from  .
 
Yum yum, look, come on over here.
And that's what he was like on Wednesday night, he said look 
 
as so , more or less as soon as he'd said hello he said erm  thirty two and two minutes past the hour, they're your trains.
I checked them up.
So I thought I couldn't even say
look
Why?
at one like ten past.
But he didn't .
Well, I would go along and 
Mm.
pick you up and meet you one evening.
That's very sweet of you Michael.
I must say you 
He doesn't know where you've told him you're going to be does he?
No, don't ever tell 
No.
them.
And that's something
No.
Christine said.
Thank God he doesn't know where she lives here cos he'll be round knocking on the door.
I know, but the appalling thing is  that the address list was given out  at the A G M  and Christine's phone number is on it.
Cos Rachel rang me at work and said I need your phone number.
I've been fobbing her off saying, I haven't got anywhere permanent.
She said, I need your home number.
Well you'll just have to change it when you leave.
Give them, give them Hazlemere number or something.
Isn't that too far?
Mm mm.
Sorry er i 
but who was that, who was that list handed round to?
To everyone in the choir  presumably.
Oh that's dreadful!
Oh God!
So you  really 
Don't you 
 
tell Christine that.
Cos she actually said to me, thank God  we're not gonna have him bothering us.
Well I thought 
Don't erm 
I'll have to say I'm Rachel because our voices sound the same.
Yeah well just don't let Christine know.
Just
Mm.
just say that
Don't erm  that's very bazaar don't you 
Mm mm.
think?
I think, I think that's, I 
Phone numbers handed out.
no I don't think that's on.
Because if you had, I don't think Christine's even got her number in the book.
He's got my work number.
So that's issuing someone's number.
Oh yeah.
You know
Mm mm.
An ex-directory one.
Mm.
I mean it's one thing letting the committee know for their records or something.
Don't tell them you have one.
But not just for the 
 
Well that's it, I gave it 
Just say you don't have the telephone.
out.
Mm.
Yes, but when you move to Fulham.
Oh!
I've just moved into a new flat, I don't have a telephone.
Yeah.
Mm mm.
And stick to it.
Yes.
And say the other one isn't valid now.
Mm.
Well just give your work number.
Mm.
I think that's fine if you give them your work number.
That's what 
Yes but what about work?
I've given.
I mean you're there five days a week.
I know that's what I've given.
Mm mm.
I'm delaying you now am I?
You're not.
I thought that meal was so delicious!
Mm mm.
This gravy is delicious as well!
Mm mm.
Do you like it?
Mm mm.
Took me  thirty seconds to make that gravy.
So what's that made out of?
Booze.
I chose the booze 
And has it got alcohol in it?
It has.
I wondered whether it had.
Erm  it's made from  Bisto, this instant
Mm mm.
granules.
You'd never believe that would you?
No.
Chicken variety.
With 
Oh right.
er two tablespoons of Madeira
Oh lovely!
Lovely!
and some  redcurrant and port jelly.
Mm mm!
Mm.
It's absolutely delicious!
Well   we've nothing to mop it up with.
Dab it behind the ears.
I'm gonna get Yum Yum to clear mine off.
It's good that bottle of gravy.
You'd never know it.
No that's great.
Little trick I learnt years 
Cos that's nice.
Chris does one actually.
years and years and years ago.
Mm mm.
And you can vary it though, if you're having lamb by putting some mint jelly.
Delicious!
Well I certainly wouldn't worry about being rude to that  to Don the train spotter.
No, I think there's some people you have to be very blunt to.
Donald .
Mm.
Don .
He's, he's an obsessive person.
I think his mummy and daddy were poor.
Did he tell you?
being a train spotter.
Who?
You did.
Who?
No, I thought, I thought you meant you'd spoken to him after my date.
No,they were on  before you went on your date .
Left mine afterwards .
Mm mm.
No he's very odd.
Cos I did 
Does he friends within the choir?
I did more or less ignore on the tube journey and the walk to the choir that evening, I mean 
Mm mm.
I'm very aware of
Not encouraging him.
Yes.
So, I I didn't er, I didn't instigate a conversation at all.
But it sounds as though he doesn't realize that.
I didn't ask him whether he got back 
But some people are so 
alright, I didn't  I answered  in monosyllables.
Mm.
I didn't instigate a conversation.
And then I ran out after the 
But he probably couldn't believe his luck that he was going out with you that night.
He said I couldn't believe you said 
I mean what happened erm 
yes straightaway.
I was thinking 
How's that?
that's because of the Mozart, not you.
In highlighted pen that you know  so when he goes out with someone in ninete , in two thousand he'll say to someone  the last time I went out with someone was in nineteen ninety three.
 
It's sad isn't it?
But I felt sorry for him, I did, but that was my immediate reaction that 
Has he got a good voice?
Yes.
He's a good singer?
Mm.
He is.
Well he's obviously musical if he's  involved in E M I as well.
Mm mm.
But he can be, he's very, perhaps a bit bossy in it, and erm  may, maybe bitter I feel.
Doesn't have a very good sense of humour.
Mm mm.
I don't think anybody should go out with someone on their own  in the beginning, I really don't.
Do you not, Gearoid.
No.
Not nowadays.
I don't care what anybody says.
Whether it's two 
Yeah.
guys  or two women 
Mm mm.
or anything, I really don't think anyone  should put themselves in that position.
You're better off going out as a threesome or a foursome
Yeah.
Yeah but if you get asked out 
but until you 
for a date, you're not going to say can I bring my friend?
By a total stranger?
Well I suppose I wouldn't do that with a total stranger.
She did.
I know, but a stra , what do you mean, what do you classify as a stranger?
Someone you don't know 
Yeah.
anything about.
I know that they're they're 
Because I go out 
they're involved in the ca 
if 
in the, erm the choir.
Just because you work with the guy
But you've never had a conversation with him.
Mm mm.
Just because you know the guy from Marks and Spencers.
I did that with Graham.
I went out, I hadn't even  I'd said hello to him, that was it.
You see, I think that's really strange  in this day and age.
Yes but you're meeting in a public place.
Not like, I mean I was making my way there, he was making his way there  and  I wouldn't want them to come and pick me up in the car
Mm mm.
and me go off, I wouldn't do that  without really  you know, having been out with him a few times.
But I'd make 
Good.
my own way there and meet them.
In a public place.
But if I met, but then that's slightly different because if I met someone in a  nightclub or  something like that  then I would be quite wary.
Mm mm.
I don't think I'd  I don't know  I don't know what I'd do.
I'd feel quite differently.
But something like the choir or where you've been working, I don't know you, I, I've got this thing which is
Well I still 
I think 
think
you, you know you feel safe .
that even in something like the choir  it's somebody that you should of struck up a, er a relationship  you know, over several 
The 
intervals.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you suddenly, you thought to yourself  well  you know I actually quite like this chap.
Mm.
You know, wouldn't it be nice if he had asked me out.
And then suddenly the day 
Mm mm.
comes along.
Not to sort of well you, you can't be blamed because I mean  yo , in the innocent you were actually going because of the concert.
I know.
You see I ne 
But he didn't , you know, he, he can't believe his luck that somebody 
No.
as attractive as you 
 
said yes  
 
he's got this goat beard and this hairy bottom lip!
 
You know, breathe that smells of moth balls, I mean who would have thought of that.
And he, and 
If he were taking several of you out why didn't you say to one of the other girls  why don't you come?
Did he have a pair of tickets?
Cos it was when we were walking down
Michael can I have a look please?
Oh  sorry !
Thank you.
Oh sorry.
Oh gross!
They are beautiful!
My darling would you pass me
Can I have some more milk?
Lovely.
Thank you
very much.
I better not put these on the table.
You did very well with these.
Interesting.
These are the ones that I saw on the 
Yes but you've got those brown ones that Paula gave you.
I know, but I don't wear brown.
Which is why .
I think it's lovely though with black.
They're very 
Yes.
smart aren't they?
Well who gave you, did you like Rachel's nice jacket?
Yeah.
I said that to you.
Yes, okay.
It brings out
Yeah.
You see I haven't got any unus , I've got stuff a bit like that, but I haven't got any  anything like this.
The heel and everything's lovely isn't 
Yeah.
it?
You look very dressy aren't you?
May I  start my chocolate?
 
Absolutely.
Don't  don't dribble it.
Yes.
Put it round this way.
   
 
I thought I'm going to eat some.
Mm.
Yes because we won't be going  
After that  comes.
late tonight.
Could you  could you pass me the milk please?
Yes.
My greatest pleasure.
  

Try this.
Oh that's nice.
 
Because it's so busy for me.
On five  in this one?
Yeah.
 
 
Pardon ?
  

What is he actually saying ?
And we haven't got a clue.
 
 
See you've done very well knocking those together.
Think nothing of it.
 
Neither do we.
Haphazard.
One week it'll be all savoury biscuits to go with  and  chocolate cake.
This cake's lovely are you not having any?
Yes.
Oh yes,
Just that I haven't passed her any
Oh sorry!
cake.
Sorry .
Oh sorry, sorry, sorry !
Oh well please calm down.
Just grab the knife up over head and down at the table.
This is a very timely supper.
 
  

You were tempted to take a knife out of?
I didn't have time.
Michael was asking about my menswear.
But he'd be made-to-measure.
But he didn't have any did he?
Waistcoats.
Oh no!
I remember we saw  in the other shop   It happened again.
Do you have any use for your  French  jacket at all?
When did you buy some jackets in France?
He .
And then  we got know the   go and get myself out of Marks and Spencers this weekend  which  for menswear particularly it was very  dowdy .
And, and we  .
Snobs!
Unlike your shoes Rachel, it's glossed out.
 
No.
Oh dear.
  

Was that in the sale, or that was the normal price?
In the sale.
I've never seen this gentleman .
Really?
Twenty five pounds is very good.
Don't you want some more milk?
No.
No we'll just pocket the money.
 
 
But you said that they buy
Yes, but they sell, you can buy 
I doubt it.
articles, but they sell them back again.
No thank you.
No thank you.
Sure?
No I'm alright.
Okay.
But then they se , you see they sell those in their staff shop.
But
I thought it was meant to be anonymous.
.
It's   up to a point .
Tell us about your job .
I can't stand it !
Aye well 
Whose , whose mother did you see this morning?
Mm mm.
Why have you just tipped cream on that?in Cornwall.
Not indeed, I recognise it.
The Royal Albert Hall.
Th the commissionaires on the doorway.
But will they be defending .
Yeah .
That is a West Sussex term .
Been teaching it to Hazlemere.
Keep your hands close to the  dish now Michael.
And we just  .
Getting Michael giggly.
No Red Rock's come back.
I just wondered if you'd rather 
 
pay it back.
It is on.
Isn't it?
Testing, testing, testing .
You're not supposed to know .
Oh my, I'm not supposed to see.
Switch it off now for a few minutes.
Okay?
Ah ah!
I'll leave you with that.
The  worm.
Look at these flowers!
So these are lovely!
Mm mm.
Five cheesies to one slurp of drink.
Hmm mm.
Why is it pure gin?
I think Ted would be proud of me.
Well, my stars say   if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry.
Every so often we all need to wind down.
There you are.
If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign.
It simply means you're in the process of recharging your batteries and reassessing your priorities .
Well Anna-Marie is there something you want to tell us?
I'm Cancer.
What does it say about me.
Mm.
Market forces do not make the world go round.
The earth does not spin on its axis for profit, the sun does not shine because it happens to have shares in a household firm.
If any force guides the universe, universe, it surely must be love.
In allowing yourself to be led now by the same illogical but kind motive, you are not being as silly as you think.
Indeed, the more selfless you can be this weekend, the better things will work out 
Oh how nice.
That sounds good to me .
What's Virgo?
Better .
It doesn't make sense to buy the cheapest brand of baked beans to save a few pence.
It's true.
So then fill your car tank at the most expensive petrol station  in town.
If you're going to make economies , make efficient ones.
Similarly, if you are going to be extravagant, be so in an a area,where you're actually going to see the benefit  
So you see 
Ha 
I told you you should have those two pairs of shoes.
happiness will come to all Virgos  who aim the right arrows at the right targets this weekend .
Gearoid, what are you?
It depends.
It is the nineteenth of February, which one does it fall on theirs?
Pisces or  Aquarius?
Pisces.
Aquaria , Aquarius.
Mhm.
Expect a hectic weekend.
Hmm mm.
You will have to spend a lot of time preventing tricky scenarios from getting any worse or keeping antagonistic individuals apart.
Who was that .
Simultaneously, you may be fending off  criticism from a friend or relative who feels 
Ah oh!
Aha.
Yes.
who feels your ,your plans  are not in their best interest.
Well
So naff off!
You can though perform a successful damage limitation exercise if you try.
You may even be able to coax a victory out of the situation .
That's Gearoid for you.
But if you attend church
I love this ad.
Tea!
Coffee!
What?
I shouldn't be so lazy.
Well we are.
I know but  there's a lot of food coming out now.
I can't believe how strong 
Is there?

It's good though.
I can feel the backs of my eyes warming now.

My cheek, yeah.

Clara B seems to live in fear of me appearing on there one evening.
Her tuning in and watching .
Probably you will.
You're joking ?
They interviewed, interview you to get on there anyway.
The one thing that really,apar , well not the one thing, many things irritate me about the programme, but one of them is  that they  get people on so you've got someone choosing who lives in Edinburgh  choosing someone who lives down in Plymouth
Mm mm.
you know, amongst someone else who's from  you know  Wales or something.
Mm mm.
 
I mean it's so silly!
Mm.
Well
They should all have them from a similar area because most of the time they say  oh well they live so far away
Mm mm.
you know.
I don't like it when they're horrid to each other.
Well there was a big  row, and I thought it was going to get really nasty.
They were so horrendous to each other.

So you could go to that.
I'm quite interested in seeing that.
Mm.
I'd like to see the Fugitive.
And Much Ado About Nothing.
I'm not sure if there's anything on.
We went to see something called the Wedding Banquet.
Called the Wedding Banquet?
Banquet.
Really?
It was absolutely hysterical!
I've never laughed so much.
Is this the one that you were talking about in the
Dunno.
I've not heard of that.
It's starts very quietly at the stage, there's very little  you know
Mm.
or anything but it's just
Oh really?
taken off.
Oh lovely!
It's about these two chaps living in New York  one is American and the other is er  Hong Kong, no Chinese  and they're an affair, they're living 
Mm.
together, very sort of 
Mm.
you know, kind, one is an architect and the other  the Chinese guy is a property dealer.
And he  so when it started he said sometimes my  drives me mad.
Oh oh!
You know, I wouldn't put that in where, in any review.
Yeah.
and in fact it starts off with him in the gym  doing his work out  and he has this Sony Walkman on
Yes.
and he's listening to a tape that his mum has sent him.
Instead of writing letters they sent tapes.
Oh right.
Yeah.
And it's the usual, well you know son you're getting on now and it's time to settle down and I've put your name down for agency in  Taiwan or whatever, and we've got this lovely girl who we think is ideal for you, da da, da da da  and we're sending over the papers for you to fill in.
So  erm  amongst the business property that he has he has this warehouse  with 
Mm.
a Chinese girl she's living in it, in a kind of a real dive of loft thing to do her art and she gives him the odd painting instead of paying rent.
Mm.
So things are getting more and more  fraught with the folks back home who are determined to have him married.
So he's filling in the application form of the dating agency, he said the girl's got to be five foot ten, living in China,
Mm mm.
an opera singer, erm
Is this is story?
This is a movie.
Film.
Oh right.
Got to have at least two degrees, if not three kind of thing.
Mm.
And you know, they're ticking off all these things jokingly and of course back comes a tape from mother,.
She's five foot ten, opera singer, she's got four degrees, and she's coming to Manhattan on Thursday kind of thing, to meet you.
Oh no!
No!
So the girl is in on this, the artist  and  he goes off to meet this er bride-to-be at the airport  and she comes in , perfectly , she looks like a model off of, off of Vogue, he practically drops dead of course .
Mm.
But he has no interest in her  at all.
He doesn't 
Mm.
want to marry her, but it gets funnier and funnier.
So  to shut the parents up  he says  I'm going to marry you.
Will you be  with  who's the artist.
Right.
Well, we're just gonna have a simple ceremony and er afterwards   that's it.
Yeah.
And apparently this couple who desperately  in China, you simply don't do it, you have a wedding banquet and that's all there is too it.
We're coming on the next flight  for the wedding.
And of course, they're all changing bedrooms, she's trying to memorize, you know, his favourite food and  where does he put his underwear and all this kind of thing.
Oh no!
It's absolutely hysterical!
Oh it sounds great!
Oh right!
It's wonderful!
It's so funny!
And then they have the wedding.
This girl is just so sensational!
The artist?
When she's dressed in the, the gown 
Really?
and everything  beautiful looking!
Really?
And then it goes to
But they do actually get married then?
They get married at City Hall so that she can have her green card and stay.
And, and then they go and have this  they go to dinner  like, his parents   his wife  his boyfriend
Mm mm.
and the other girl  and they go to this very chichi Chinese restaurant  and when they walk in the manager of the restaurant recognizes his father  who is obviously a very important man in China before the revolution  and he goes over, chats   so in honour of the Mr Moo Bing, you know
Yeah .
such important guest this evening  she's let him into the banquet and of course the guys are dying at this stage.
No!
So they have a wedding banquet that is  breathtaking!
This room was just   with decorations!
Really?
All the lanterns and her hair and everything, and the food and everything looked superb!
drink though cos I'm driving.

Are you reading him again.
I'm doing the Winter's Tale for Tuesday.
I did that for A-level.
Mm that's the most famous .
Mhm.
I went to see it at the Barbican, it's very good.
How much of Shakespeare do you have to do or do you have to do it all?
You can't possibly have to do it all do you?

Well I quite liked I preferred those.
The ones I really liked that we did last year were  the erm we did Great Expectations.
Oh yes.

But I'll drop my English after Christmas.
I do my exam in January and then I drop it because I go on a teaching practice and I pick it up halfway through third year.
Oh really  
How much teaching practice do you have to do?
I've got odd days and then a six week block.
And do you know where you're having that teaching practice?
Mm in Guildford.
Oh that's right, you said yes.
It's next door to my old middle school, it's where a lot of my friends went.
Are any of your friends teaching?
There?
Or in the teaching profession .
No.
Will you be a good teacher?
Pardon?
Will you be a good teacher?
Oh I don't know.
Who knows.
I think it's in the blood though isn't it with our family.
Yeah there's a lot of teachers .
.
Yes and erm  side as well.
Daddy's side has got his cousins, two of his cousins are teachers, his sister's a teacher.
Apparently his mother taught, that's how she met .
I don't know if I'd want to stay in teaching, I'd quite like to have my own nursery school.
But what I'd do is I'd I'd do it from hours something like eight until six and I'd give them a cooked lunch all fresh food
Mm.
and after say three o'clock in the afternoon they'd do activities, work connected with
School.
school.
Joy-riding, mugging.
Yes.
Yes.
.
If you g if you attend a nursery school, you're less likely to fall into criminal ways than if you haven't attended a nursery school.
Why's that?
I've never heard that before.
It's a fact.
.
It's according to satist to statistics and studies carried out.
But what's the reasoning behind that.
The reasoning behind that is that  come from a lower class generally if you can't you know you can't go to a nursery school cos you have to pay for nursery school education in this country.
And  you don't actually start learning how to how to structure and do things in your leisure time.
Cos at nursery school it's basically it is leisure.
Mm.
Pursuits that you're doing.
You see if you if you haven't been introduced to those when you're young.
At an early age.
It's actually and that's the most absorbent time, your mind's most absorbent where you're up to the age of five which is when you should when you're at nursery school.
And if you come from a family that don't bother and they haven't got the time to  show you how to do things, or do things with you, and don't send you to a nursery school then you start you know just I suppose like what they do is .
Well I think the attitude is and maybe I'm totally wrong  the attitude is that if they're outside, they're not creating mess and havoc in the house.
Mm.
Mm.
sort of turn a blind eye.
Mm.
You don't remember
When we were out for lunch a few weeks ago, Alan asked where I was brought up and I said  popped out on stalks  two brothers had gone to school at .
What were their names?
.
I can't say I remember that one.
And I'm afraid I don't know the other brother's name.
I think you'd be inclined to remember that name.
Well I was little red riding hood
I know.
in our production.
I would have thought that would have been your cup of tea.
.
I found it very inaccessible.
Sorry.
Very inaccessible  it seemed to me.
Well you have to travel by car to the station.
Oh it seemed to be a terrible drive.
Well you just turn off the A three at  instead of.
We just weren't used to driving in the country then, it seemed like a long way from
So we're down to Guildford but not through Guildford.
No not Guildford, you carry on the A three
Further on.
Much further on.
Further on.
Much further on.
And you instead of taking the instead of going as far as the  traffic lights to come to us, you take the  exit before that which is 
Mm.
and you just go down through there and you come into .
It's not I wouldn't say
very very .
Mm.
But to go to  and to go to  I would have thought would have taken similar lengths of time.
Yeah.
I remember the .
Poplars it was called was it?
Did you get it yesterday?
Junipers junipers.
So he converted his barn which was huge and he used it for recitals, put a lovely grand piano in it.
Mm.
to raise money for charity.
I think .
Are they real then.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
You could actually do these yourselves.
Mm.
You can grow them from seed.
There's a  to be made in developing a teapot that doesn't drip.
Yes absolutely.
It's just a million pounds and more.
Well I'm not moving only because it's the actually there is a bit more room isn't there.
Where are the dogs?
There's one on a chair.
And then the sofa.
Oh they're both over here.
Oh right.
On the floor flaked out.
What was life like for you before you had your cottage here?
What was life like for us?
Erm  
 
spend money stupidly.
We'd go out for dinner or we'd be
In the shops.
in the shops buying  
You see it's limited really isn't it?
What  
Being in London.
Being in London
All the time.
Yeah yeah.
Mm, not having any escape.
It's ridiculous.
I mean  you know we've proved the point with the the money that we used to spend stupidly.
Really you've noticed the difference?
We're spending the money now on the cottage and things like that but it just makes it just makes you think what we were frittering away.
Yeah.
And we'd go to the theatre or but I mean we do all that sort of thing still but we just have to cram it into the week.
Yes yes.
For you.
Oh no, really.
Blackberry jam.
Try it.
Oh God.
You must open it.
I will.
when did you get me some?
I bought it in Paris.
Did you?
lovely.
delicious.
Perfect.
.
Mhm.
We've been so lucky it hasn't rained.
Mhm.
Very lucky.
Last weekend and this week although last weekend was much hotter..
Mm.
Sing.
.
Strawberry mm they're delicious.
These are Marks and Spencers .
I like them cos I find some croissants are too buttery.
There's something wrong with her  jam.
.
Grandma used to make croissants didn't she?
Where did you get all the beads from?
in Paris.
Mm do you have to take them off every time you wash it?
No I walked through the children's department one day and I saw this necklace with these beads hanging from it
Mm.
I know where I could use those.
So I went over and I bought two necklaces, I gave them to Julie who made the shirt, and she took them apart
Mm.
sewed them on.
Mm.
Is that material
You don't approve Rachel.
I do.
I was just thinking about the practicalities of it.
Is that material brought back from San Francisco.
It is from San Diego.
Oh right.
It's lovely isn't it.
I I like it.
I'm just fascinated by all those things.
I told you about  didn't I?
Remind me?
With all the cowboy boots.
Oh yeah.
.
I have one that's got it's like a desert scene with cacti and a cowboy and this
Mm.
bison.
Really.
Yahoo and  yippee-ai-ay 
Thank you.
Dig in.
I'm going to  it's wonderful.
square dancing .
I'm not sure that erm a West Irelander's worthy of one of these.
Mm.
Mm that's delicious.
You should try some Anne Marie.
I like my croissants .
Mm really blackberry.
There's nothing worse than a jam where there's not bits in  it could be anything.
Looks like a jelly .
Mm.
of people who wouldn't eat this.
That would only eat the jelly.
Because this has got the bits in?
Mm.
It's like people who eat marmalade  has no peel in it.
Do you like marmalade with no peel?
I don't like marmalade.
The peel is even more off putting to me.
Urgh.
I I wouldn't eat marmalade anyway.
We were brought up on peanut butter.
And Marmite.
Delightful .
I like Marmite.
On toast or
Mm.
What did you 
We were allowed to have peanut butter I think on Saturdays.
Well we never had erm  we never had crunchy peanut butter.
towards the end but.
No she still buys smooth erm  I remember I must have been about three years old, it was when we were still up North and mummy was dashing out, it was breakfast time and she go easy on the peanut butter, there's hardly any left.
So not only did I ea spread one side with peanut butter, I turned it over 
Good for you.
We were in a supermarket, I don't know where it was but somewhere in the states  and I told you   I think they're boast were sixty something varieties of peanut butter.
How could you have so many varieties of peanut butter .
Well you have combinations of you know, peanut butter and jelly
Ooh.
flavoured with cinnamon.
No.
Ooh gosh I'm sorry but that's just
huge number of bizarre things.
Actually they're crazy into cinnamon aren't they?
Mm.
Well I'll never forget when we were younger, we had erm some Americans living across the road and they invited us er somehow  I was in the kitchen, they were going to give me lunch and she gave me the most enormous 
You probably barged your way in Rachel  
Probably.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I didn't know what to do with it because I certainly couldn't eat it.
It was just appalling.
I've never experienced anything like it .
Did you try to eat it?
I did.
Anybody want tea?
Well I found it very hard.
Thank you.
Fruit flavoured honey?
Mm.
What's that like?
It's really lovely.
Like raspberry honey.
Yeah.
Really?
Strawberry honey, cinnamon honey.
They're really lovely spread.
chocolate decadence.
Chocolate  
Are these in America?
What's chocolate decadence then?
Chocolate spread?
Put it in the microwave for two minutes, and it's liquid  chocolate sauce..
Really.
Oh God.
This must be nearly Oh no it's ten.
Well we're earlier than we were yesterday.
Yeah.
We're very well organized.
I slept like a log last night .
Did you I wondered whether 
Oh really.
you'd slept alright or not?
The dogs were up and down a lot.
Did you hear them upstairs at one stage?
Yes.
I heard them.
During the night.
was very cross that he couldn't get into the room.
Mm hopefully.
Well tough shit.
Well I invited them up this morni They were so excited this morning when I came down.
Yes but I think they
They were jumping up and putting their paws up so they I went up back upstairs and they sk tried to skid up but they were going so quickly that one of them went down the step again.
And basically they managed to jump up on the bed unlike yesterday morning where  pretended she couldn't get up on the bed.
Mhm.
He.
He.
Are you going to try any of this ?
No I won't thank you.
I mean I'm sure I'd like it.
I love the way he calls his grandfather granddad.
yes I heard him saying that.
Really.
That's rather unnerving  
Captivating, he's a very captivating .
And he was chatting away to them.
That's not the way you do that .
She's a teacher.
Oh is she?
That explains it then.
Mm.
Oh yes, I've never ever heard them speak you know, to him as though he's a baby.
Mm.
It's always been almost on their level.
Mm.
And you know from as soon as he could walk it was explained to him you know, that you must walk and not and 
So there's no father?
Which I think is a blessing cos I think he's a real so and so.
Who, the father?
Mm he was an actor in Emmerdale Farm.
Was he?
Yes.
Which one was he then?
The people who own the riding school or 
Mm no it doesn't mean anything.
So he's left he left her?
She left him.
They were never married.
What does he play around?
Well are they married?
I wouldn't do that for you Rachel.
I wouldn't expect you to.
I just thought if they were married and had children or something then they .
Much to mummy and daddy's despair, none of them are showing any inclination to.
anyone?
She didn't look that young.
She is actually the younger.
Yes she's in her twenties.
No.
Yes.
Sorry.
Really?
Yeah I think she's  Yeah I think she's twenty six or something.
what's her name?
Anna's the eldest, she's thirty five?
Thirty seven.
So there can't be that much of a gap between them.
I think there is.
She looks a lot older than that.
So do you have quite a few famous connections round here?
Did that guy live round here then?
No.
No, Yorkshire .
Oh she used to live up there did she?
Mm.
Had a cottage at a very remote location.
Quite a rustic
Mm.
way of life.
rustic Yorkshire .
And while he was on the film set or wherever he was you know, away from home for the week, he'd be playing around with every bit of skirt he could find.
But I think she's doing a good job of bringing Thomas up I must say..
She certainly doesn't  any kind of handicap or a stigma.
Good.
which is good.
it's young for her I mean
And she's got him into a very good er nursery school apparently.
Somewhere in Blackheath.
Erm which is close to where she's goes to school.
It's costing her a lot of money.
Oh she doesn't live down here?
Oh right.
They all live in London.
And erm  and she says you know well she just has to do what she has to do  he can go to school and  but she'll just have to make do on you know, what money she has.
she's on a very good salary.
What does she do then?
Eighteen or twenty thousand a year as a teacher.
Plus single mother's benefit.
She's not exactly destitute.
mortgage as well Gearoid.
paying the mortgage.
I'm sure she is.
I was thinking it  another room  bigger.
It's it's about half the size again.
If you if you did get  how would how would 
We'd have to keep 
you do it?
We'd have to keep the outside as is, it would always have to have two front doors.
Mm.
But that's no bad thing, if you ever wanted to sell it.
Erm
.
Just knock through here.
I mean the whole thing would have to be redesigned.
So you wouldn't knock upstairs cos you'd have two staircases wouldn't you?
I quite like that actually.
Sally has two staircases.
It's not unusual.
What yo you would have to do a a lot of remodelling downstairs because t there's no point having two kitchens.
But if we had the accommodation downstairs, you we could ea easily have a good sitting room that we never use.
Have it there for show.
.
Is that the way they've done it or
It is very  
What does that what do you what do you mean?
Their furniture their furnishings.
It's very white .
Oh is it.
Yeah it's all it's very stark.
So it's not kind of country cottage style.
No she has a couple of nice pieces though.
Erm wi if you had the accommodation of both houses downstairs, you'd have you'd easily have a good size sitting room.
You'd have a d a separate dining room.
Mm.
You'd then maybe have like a little library .
Yeah.
And and a good size kitchen breakfast room.
You'd actually have quite a lot of accommodation downstairs.
Mm and four bedrooms.
And four bedrooms.
You see we'd get rid rid of one bathroom, in fact I'd maybe be tempted to put a bathroom upstairs .
It could be en suite.
Mm.
With like a dressing room .
isn't there.
Well er I mean eventually we'd have to think of something .
But it it's if we don't have that opportunity with next door then  some years down the line .
But would you consider touring erm retiring here?
I know it's a long way off but you mentioned retirement yesterday.
You taking early retirement?
 
All your secrets.
 

I've no interest in work.
I loathe work.
Mm.
I just loathe work.
I think life is too short.
 
if you can retire at fifty.
Well we'd have to divest ourselves of some of our assets.
I also think there's no point retiring at sixty five you know, aged and decrepit.
Mm.
Probably incontinent and  you know whatever 
Mm mm.
And then you start thinking well you know now I'll see the world.
What's the point?
Yeah.
I mean you want to see the world when you you know when you're fit and able.
Mm yeah.
And do the things you can.
two years isn't he and he can retire early.
He'll be about fifty seven.
he could still do work, I mean he could still 
 
I think he'd want to have some kind of little business going where if he wants to he can go off  And then he can go off and pick it up and
And he does like to travel.
I know he is thinking of going to France .
Whereabouts?
In the middle really isn't it?
He doesn't want to go too far down to the South.
In  an hour north east of Paris, going towards Belgium.
No I think that's too north isn't it.
Yeah.
Yeah because our uncle also wants to  so they didn't know whether they should all go and get  or whatever I don't know.
But mummy's not very keen.
She wants to be near us.
She wants us to settle down and then she knows where she w where she should be.
And then she can go off.
And daddy's doing his advanced French classes .
Is he.
And he was delighted that he learnt how to say, I'm having a lie-in tomorrow morning.
Very useful when one is taking early retirement.
Is he I didn't know he'd started doing advanced French.
Where?
In .
Cos I thought he did advanced French last year.
He had yes he had some some last year .
she teaches business English to French people .
To French people.
Really.
And she teaches business French to Englishmen.
And she's one of the highest qualified French teachers around, she's adorable
Really.
don't have the same character, the other two are very .
A bit cold.
They're not just cold but you know, I'm sure everything that's done is plotted.
