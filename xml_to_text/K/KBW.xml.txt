On the remote control, he wanted to do it.
Yes, you can switch it off if you want to.
We can switch it on again later on so there's no worry.
Are we going to do these fish?
I'll go and use the bucket.
Well I'll come and help you Tim cos we don't want it falling all over the place.
Whoops.
Careful careful.
Oh that's the empty one.
That's alright.
Here's the full one.
And and this is the empty one.
Ooh!
Now, this is.
Have you cleaned up?

Well that's  we need Christopher to do it as well don't we?
Yeah.
Now whatever you do don't drip it all over me stereo.
Okay?
Who's gonna get the weed out?
Me.
Well you could perhaps do it together but be careful.
Mind the fish.
Whoops.
If you drop it into this one with the clean water in.
Whoops, look out cos it's dripping.
Right, it's Christopher's turn then, you've had one turn.
Can you 
Oh he hasn't got his sleeves done up yet look.
Only two.
Two what?
Two arms look.
True.
You'd look funny with four wouldn't you?
I I go and get a er a .
No but
Just let me go and get the cups from the kitchen.
 

Mum, Tim is making me  drop this and hurt the fish.
Tim is making you what?
Drop the  mm 
Drop this.
That's it.
When can I do the bridge?
Whoops.
I want to do the bridge.
I do the bridge.
Well as they're Christopher's fish we'll let Christopher do the fish  d sorry do the bridge.
Go on then.
Whoops.
No 
Got it.
Okay now then when we pu whoops  that's it.
Now I think we'll, that needs washing out doesn't it, that bridge?
It's pretty  mucky.
Right, put the dirty water in this bucket then with the bridge.
I want that please.
What the jug?
Mm.
I think you'd be better with a cup myself.
No I want the
No come on cos he might go and get the fish in the jug and then we'll be in a mess.
Why will the fish go into the jug?
Be careful because they don't want to be in a thunder storm.
Hello fish.
Are you alright in there?
Yes thank you.
Oh good.
I'm taking the bits out.
Right.
I I'm taking the bits out.
Well just take all the, it's pretty dirty, look at the stones.
We wash the whole bit out don't we?
Mm.
Okay.
We need to leave them some to swim in before we catch them.
Just a little bit more.
Gently Tim.
Why can't we leave them in that water?
Well what do you think would happen to the poor things if left them in that water?
I don't know.
Do you know that fish can't breathe unless they're in water?
So if they're out of the water they die just like if we're under the water  too long we die.
Right, I think we should stop now and get them out of there.
Stop Tim.
I I 
Can I borrow this, this cup now to fish these fish out.
Fish the fish.
Come on fish.
Fish the fish out.
Here you come.
Are you Edward or Bertie?
Erm

Whoops.
Think that one is Edward.
Right Edward, come on.
Think that's Edward.
Come on Edward.
Yes that's Edward.
In here please.
Thank you.
That's Edward.

That's bigger than the other one.
But that's the 
Whoops.
Bertie's disappearing.
Come on Bertie, in this cup.
Aha caught you.
There we are.
Now then I'll take those over there.
You don't need to do that now look cos I can just carry the thing into the kitchen.
Come and help me with the stones in the kitchen.
I've got some stones.
No no.
Don't get the stones out you  dilly What a noggin!
Right, let's take this into the kitchen and clean it up.
Can you bring the bridge.
Bridge?
Yeah we need the bridge but don't tip the 
Take that one then.
That's got the bridge in it.
Try not to drip it everywhere though Tim.
Mum.
Mm.
Can I get the water to .
Pardon?
Can I get the water to go in it with the jug?
Hello.
I've finished.
Yeah.
We've already got some water.
Ugh look, it's horrible.
Ugh!
What do you have to put stones at the bottom for?
Think we shall have to scrub these  cos it's so horrid today.
Mummy.
Mummy what?
Oh my goodness.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
I thought you were just bringing the bridge.
Didn't realize you were bringing the whole thing.
There we go.
Mum  when you  took it all back when there's a bit 
When we've what?
more water in  when you're ready to put more water in, can I get the water and put it in the jug and pour it in?
Yeah, if you want to.
We've actually got clean water in there cos that's clean water that's in the bucket that the fish are swimming in now.
Hello .
Hello.
I've lost the brush.
We need a brush for this.
Oh here we are.
Right.
   
My favourite dinner.
Is it your favourite dinner?
Do you know what it is?
Yeah.
It's meant to be cottage pie but I've put some 
 
What?
I've put some breadcrumbs on the top instead of cheese.
Because we seem to like that at the moment don't we?
It needs to go in the oven really.
What?
It needs to go in the oven really.
Pardon?
What did you say?
I really  this time.
Really tatty?
Mm.
Really tatty.
What?
Oh you mean the stones.
Yeah.
It's quite  it's quite erm
Are the fish tatty?
It's a long time, no no no, it's a long time we since we er cleaned them.
It's just dirty really rather than tatty.
Whoops.
water at me.
Pardon?
Tim's throwing water at me.
Tim, what are you doing?
Can you come in here Tim so I can see you please.
Tim.
Let's go and see what he's up to.
Come on.
What are you doing?
You're not throwing water are you?
No.
No we'll all get wet if you do.
Cos we're not, we don't want a bath.
Why .
Why what?
Why do you need to wash the ?
Cos they're  cos they're messy.
Look you can see it's all brown.
Ugh.
If we just wipe round the outside of the tank though, I think that will help.
Cos it's gone all funny inside, can you see?
Yeah.
Whoops.
Ugh look at that.
Ugh.
I think it's the kind of food we're using cos it's different food from the  food that we had at the beginning.
It didn't seem to get as bad as this at the beginning.
Why didn't it seem to get as bad as this?
I don't know.
It just did n't.
Is it because mummy
Pardon?
Is it because we've given them a different  have we already used a pot up?
Yes we used the little pot and then we bought that box.
Mummy.
Hello.
Where's the little pot mummy?
What's your problem?
You alright?
I wanted to put water in there.
You want to put water in?
Well we'll just give them one more swish.
Little pot mum.
What little pot?
The fish food you mean?
Well the thing was, because we bought a box and the box  was a bit flimsy, I thought we would put the new fish food into the old pot, you see.
So the old pot has still got some in  but it's really the new food.
Do you see?
Why didn't you keep it in the box?
There's still some food in there as well.
Right, okay.
If you want to put your jug of water in now, this is your moment.
Do you want to get a jug  full.
Do you want to get some from the tap?
Why?
You can if you want to.
Because it'll probably need more than what's in the bucket anyway.
Tim, do you want to carry this?
What?
Do you want to carry this?
What?
This tank.
Want to  
Can you manage?
Don't drop it will you?
Shall I hold the cup.
Don't drop it whatever you do.
Mum, do you want it up to 
Fill it up to the number one there look.
That means one pint.
Mum could you
What?
turn it on.
Okay.
I've done it.
There we are.
Put the dinner in.
Ooh.
Oh well done.
Right, away you go, see if you can get it in the
Can I have the cup now?
Oh Tim don't make hole will you?
No.
Right do it like this.
Oops.
Tim's made a hole.
I think you're doing it a bit roughly Tim.
Can you do it more gently so the stones don't move.
Don't just pour it in one place.
You're making another hole.
Put, tip it on to the bridge and then you won't make a hole cos the bridge will be in the way.
Oop!
What a dilly.
Ah no.
If you're gonna do it like that we're gonna have to stop you from doing it.
Come on.
Mind the fish.
Poor things.
That's better Tim.
Oh no!
Disaster.
Move the video quick.
Make sure it's dried.
It is dried.
Oh!
Now just watch it with those fish please  while I get a cloth.
The bridge is under water.
The bridge is under water now, what will you do?
Yeah.
So is our room look.
No it's not under water.
It's a good job it's just water and not orange squash.
Oh!
I caught a fish.
A fish went in.
Oh Christopher be careful 
That was quite clever really.
As long as you didn't hurt him.
There you go mister fish you can go for a swim now.
Now look we've got a fish in there and a fish in there Tim so we must be careful now because otherwise we're gonna hurt them.
No there's only one in there.
I think I'd better fish that one out do you?
Yeah.
There's already one in there Tim now.
Yeah.
So when you pour the water don't go tipping it 
There's already one in there.
on top of him cos he'll get a shock.
Let's have this weed out.
one in there already.
You gonna help the weed?
Whoops.
Alright.
I can't take all of it.
Woo er  alright wait a minute now cos mummy's gonna fish this fish out.
Er Mum, how do you think I caught it?
Oh look at all the bits in there.
I don't know how you caught it love.
It was rather clever really.
Yeah because when you catch
You've just got to be careful because 
fish then 
if you're not careful you'll hurt them you see because if you  touch their tails or their fins or something.
There we are.
Right now when you're tipping it in now I should use a cup now Christopher cos the jug will be too much water for them.
Alright?
Now just gently now.
I I 
Well watch where you're pouring Tim.
Not on top of the fish please.
use that but it's got dirty now.
I'm gonna use that bit.
. I'm gonna pour it over there.
Go on then.
But that isn't in the way of the bridge.
Oh Tim.
Whoops.
Oh look, next door's got a new car.
Unless it's a visitor.
What do you think?
Got a white one look.
Will that be enough water yet?
Er  bit more I think.
Gently does it.
That was a good one Tim, well done.
Oh no.
See if you can tip it without the bits going in then.
Whoop  whoop.
I did.
What?
I did put a bit in.
Oh well.
Never mind.
It will come out next week.
What happens if you put a bit in mum?
The fish might think it's food?
Well er I think those bits that are in there are really just bits of weed.
I don't think it's anything too awful.
What's this thing?
Ooh.
That's a funny thing.
Will any ?
I should think so.
Or does it nearly 
Just a little bit.
I think we've nearly got enough now don't you?
Mm.
No we haven't yet.
Well  if we have too much more we shall 
What?
have it overflowing.
And we don't want erm it over if it gets 
I'll g 
right to the top
Mm?
we'll have to stop.
I think we must stop before we get right to the top.
Why?
I think we're gonna have a .
This is a laugh.
Not very easy to get now.
Is it Tim?
No.
It is.
Look Tim put it down  
Whoops.
not very much left in there now.
have you got it all here?
Oh I think there's only a tiny tiny bit left.
Now who's gonna get it  
I'll tell you what look.
You hold the cup and I'll tip the bucket, right?
I'll hold your cup.
There you go.
All done.
Right, we need a cloth now to wipe up the bits round the edges.
What are you doing?
I'm cleaning it.
Well look why don't you have one of these then you can do it properly.
Can I?
Now Tim don't wipe in the  fish will you?
Oh dear.
It's in the fish.
Well you're a silly billy you are.
It's the edges you've got to do look, not inside it.
What about putting the roof on the ?
Yeah, we need the roof on don't we?
I'll put mine over the 
Mm.
Do you want to pick up the  top, the lid please.
I've got it.
Except if we're gonna put food in we didn't ought to put it on just yet did we?
No but we could put food through there.
Oh we could put food through there.
No you want dry hands cos if you touch the food with wet hands guess what happens?
What?
Can you guess?
No.
It sticks to your fingers.
Have to wash our hands.
food.
Yeah, just make sure, oh look at your trousers!
Soaked.
When did you do that?
Mummy.
Can I have  for a long time.
I just carried  fall off.
I've not feeded the food.
Okay well just dry 
I haven't 
your fingers first.
feeded a long time.
Well you did the  I poured your, the water into your cup so it's Christopher's turn to  feed them.
What about the box?
Well you don't need the box love cos the box's got some food in but the  that's got the rest of it in.
 
washing my hands.
Well it's okay about washing them, it's the dryness that matters.
Are they dry, your hands?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Go on then.
No not too much.
Anyway I can't get too much really.
You watch underneath Tim, see if they come up to the top.
Yeah.
Are they coming?
Is that enough?
I should think so.
Tiny bit more.
Go on then.
Just a little spot.
That's lovely.
Is that going to come up?
They come up?
No.
 

They did.
Well they're probably a bit shocked now cos they've got clean water.
And their bridge is in the same place.
Not quite.
Yeah their bridge was there, yeah.
Was it?
Oh it doesn't matter.
Oh!
Good.
That's that done.
There's a er I just saw one eating food.
Yes it's gone up.
Is that eating the food or eating the weed?
I don't know.
I'm never sure if they eat this weed cos it doesn't look as if it's going anywhere.
Mum, can we watch ?
Can you watch what?
The video?
What do you want to watch?
Pardon?
I haven't watched before.
There isn't anything new, no.
I haven't got round to videoing today cos I was out teaching this afternoon.
What about the , the morning?
Er  I was out at Tesco's this morning.
In fact I went to wave goodbye to grandma.
I took her to the train.
You'll never guess, when we got to the train station 
Why?
when we got to the train station, guess what erm  grandma had to catch?
What?
A bus.
Why?
Because the trains weren't running.
They're erm electrifying the line.
You know they're putting up the electric  lines
Mm.
overhead?
Well, they've got to have a bus to get to  Barnet Green I think.
Is that nearly finished?
Er  no.
I think it's nineteen ninety three before it opens.
It's nineteen ninety two
Next year.
Yeah that's when I'm seven.
Er  yes I suppose it will be.
When you're seven.
Cos you'll be six this year won't you?
Yeah.
And seven next year.

A hundred.

Oh.
Oh Tim.
the microphone.
You just pulled it down, it's supposed to sit on there.
Mum.
Why have you have you got it on?
Well a man came earlier on today and he said please would we record conversations that we have all the time.
So you don't have to touch it, you just have to talk to me and just leave it sitting there.
It doesn't matter.
Why do you ?
Mummy.
Yes?
Mummy.
Mm.
I
How does it  test you on the jumper?
It just picks up your voice.
You know like in church?
 
You know when we go to church and you have a microphone on, and it makes your voice go round all the church?
Well it's a bit like that but instead of making it go round all the church it goes on to the tape.
This?
So it records.
Yes.
There's there's a tape in my pocket look.
Where?
In there.
Why do you have to  let's have a look at it.
We'll have a look at it later on.
Oh very, very tuneful Tim.
Why do you have to have it  Why do you have to have it?
Because  there are some people that want to  listen to what we say in our house, and what we say to each other.
And then they can think about language and how people use language.
That's a funny sound.
What about in France?
Well if you can  in Fr 
In France?
No, it won't pick up our voices in France.
But in France if they did the same thing they would be talking in French down their machine.
Hello.

Now it's five o'clock.

There's no such time as sixty one.
Sixty one minutes.
In sixty one minutes?

It's five o'clock at the moment and I don't know time he's coming.

We keep having it.
I'll tell you what, when I was in school yesterday I went into a classroom and there, hanging in a classroom, was a skeleton made out of cardboard.
And all the children had made all the different bones and it was all hanging together.
It looked really funny.

Don't touch it Tim.
But how did he how did he not get pricked?
Tim?
Ho how did Ian not get pricked?
Mm.

Taking a long time.
Oh well it was just this er meal we went out to in the evening.

Mum.
What's supposed to be so attractive about it  
I don't know.
I was really.
I mean it's   you know that means  a cafe 
A place

Trying to be totally different and failing miserably.
Yeah.
Anyway, go on.
I prefer tablecloths to .
Did it take a long time?
Yeah cos we ordered when it was .
About an hour later it arrived but we were standing at the bar when we had er  ordered it.
But that was, we were standing there for about an hour I should think it was.
And eventually they told us to go upstairs and sit down at the table.
So we did and eventually .
Was it any good?
When it came?
It was quite nice actually.
Yes it was.
Yes it was very tasty.
but rather expensive  
And this wasn't the hotel or anything.

It's a bit like that, the same with porridge isn't it?
It's called that but  eating breakfast.
That's confusing.
Right.
Right.
We'll sit down and eat soon.
Yes.
Ah.
Well what did you get up to this morning  in your  few minutes of freedom?
Or was it very hectic ?
Well it was a bit hectic cos of having this phone call to say I've got to teach in the afternoon.
I thought I'd better do all my jobs which I thought was going to be spread across the d the day.
So I went to Tesco's first thing straight back from the nursery and guess what I forgot to do?
Take me list with me 
Take your money.
No I'd got me money, but not the list.
So you did it from memory?
Mm.
And anything might happen.
Feel sick.
I checked it off when I got back and it's not too bad.
Forgot about three or four things .
What's that?
What's that?
The juice.
The juice.
And then?
And then, after I'd gone round to Tesco's I went to see  to collect grandma to take her to the train.
Which wasn't a train, it was a bus.
Was that alright?
. She got on the bus alright?
Mm.
There was one 
Mum, is she going away?
Mm.
She's going to Manchester.
Oh.
To see  Irene.
Do you remember Irene?
Sunday.
Mm.
She'll still be in Manchester.
Yeah, we won't see her on Sunday.
Mm.
Mm.
It'll be funny won't it?
Was she mea were we meant to go to her house?
Yes, we were.
So next time we have to stay at her house again?
 
I don't know .
What?
We haven't really decided that but yes, I suppose we could.
Yeah  grandma's house.
You think we'll go to grandma's house?
Because we miss it.
Mm.
Mm.
Did miss it.
We'll see what she says when she comes back.
Anyway, arrived at the station and there was this great coach standing there waiting to take them all to .
It was blocking the whole of the car park.
So this car that was trying to  get out was sitting there waiting and there was no driver in sight and people were rushing about all over the station trying to   find the driver .
Anyway it didn't worry us cos we were behind the coach.
But I did feel sorry for the man who was trying to get out cos  he must have been in there for ages.
I suppose they thought that there wouldn't be anybody trying to get out cos the train
Mm.
wasn't due out.
So I just left her getting on the bus.
I didn't sort of wait till the bus had gone or anything.
I finally managed to get a  a card for the wedding  in Tesco's.
You know, I sent them a card, Mark and Trish.
Have you?
Oh.
Who, Mark and?
Mark and Trish.
You know grandma's going to go to a wedding when she goes away?
That's why she's gone away.
Why do you have to go away?
Well that's where the wedding is.
The wedding's in Manchester.
How would you get to the station?
To catch a train.
Beg your pardon?
When you get to the station to catch a train.
When you get to the station to catch the train?
What do you mean?

Grandma went to the station to catch a train  to get to Birmingham.
Yeah?
And then she got another train in Birmingham.
Except she didn't get a train to Birmingham, she got a bus.
Well, she got a bus to  Barn Green And a train at Barn Green to Birmingham.

And off we go.
Other way.
You go backwards and I'll go forwards.
You get up and follow.
You get below and make sure everything's alright.
Aeroplane's coming down.
An aeroplane's coming down  the stairs?
Come on then.
I'm carrying the aeroplane.
 
Listen I don't think that's too good an idea cos of the duvet.
I think you'll be going to bed in that soon and if you mess it up  then you'll never sleep.
Come on, it's all very well in the mornings but not now I don't think.
Why isn't it very well in the night?
But why can't we play it in the bedroom?
Because when you get into bed it will be all out.
Cos I have to erm  change your sheets and things.
Why can't we play it in the ?
Because  if you start messing your duvet up at night times it means that you don't want to sleep underneath it cos it goes all scrunchy and horrible, and all the duvet bit comes out of the cover.
Mummy .
What's duvet bit?
It's not a good idea.
Oop, here comes Ellie now.
Who's that?
It's Ellie.
Yes, it's Ellie.

Hope he's not a milk men.
Are you going to let them in, whoever they are?
Hello!

It is Ellie.
It's me.
Come in Ellie.
Hello.
. Mum said she'll be down about ten past.
That's okay.
We've got to go and collect Dianne as well.
By the way 
Hello.
Dianne rang up just now, you've got to go  erm  and collect her please cos er Barry's not gonna come home till half seven.
He's gonna come in the car and she doesn't fancy walking in the night.
Have you got all that?
He's gonna run me over mummy.
He's gonna ru 
You can't touch me can you cos of my wires.
Mummy.
Yes?
Where's your tape?
It's all in there.
Don't worry.
When  can I listen to it?
Mm.
Please.
One day you can.
Mum why are they round?
You what?
Why are they
Just let's think what we're doing first.
Let's tell Ellie what she's gotta do and what she's not gonna do.
Basically they go to bed about half seven, if you're lucky.
Well you know .
And erm  they've done their teeth and they've had a wash and they've done everything really so all you've got to do is get them in there.
They usually   they usually have a prayer before they go to sleep, right?
They usually do one and  you do one as well.
 
And then   and then erm, what happens then?
That's it then.
A story.
Oh the stories.
I forgot about stories.
We have the stories first usually before you and they're allowed two stories each and if they have any more then it's up to you.
. But they choose their own stories so you  And if you, it looks like it's going to be an exceedingly long story you can 
Well we can start
.
Yeah, we can get started on that anyway, sort of thing before we  Erm  should the house go up in smoke, Theresa across the road  run to her 
 

Otherwise if erm  if you desperately need us sort of thing if you ring  the vicarage  and then you can erm  Alison or somebody will probably be in and  come round for 
You what?
Have I been breaking that?
Probably.
I didn't mean to.
It just sort of happened.
I know where I'm gonna put it.
Where are you gonna put it?
where you can't have it.
Where?
I don't know.
Is it a secret?
Are you putting more ?
Yeah.
It's broken.
It's in the dump.
Okay, there's your emergency phone number if you're desperate.
As long as there's somebody in .
Where shall I put it?
Stick it up here.
Television works as it works.
Coffee pot works as it works.
Help yourself to the books and everything else as you like, yeah, in case you get bored.
Oh that's nice.
Just do your own thing.
Right.
It's dirty.
Dirty?
Yeah.
What's it gonna do?
It's gonna have a bath is it?
Yeah.
a bath.
bath.
It's in the bath.
Is it clean yet?
Mum, this won't work.
What won't work?
Oh no!
No?
No water.
Mum this  keeps going  
No water?
 
Well there's probably something catching on it.
What?
There's probably something catching on it.
There's still no water there is there?
Yes.
Here.
Right, what did I need to take with me?
Bible.
Andy  can you bring my bible downstairs.
The blue one  near the bed.
You can't get it now.
You can't get it in there.
You can't get it.
You can't get it  
I can if I .
Oh no you can't.
I'm gonna hide it.
Where are you going to hide it?
Somewhere you can't have it.
Figures.
Oh.
and you can't get it.
You can't get it over there.
I might be able to.
Mum can I try and make a different .
Yeah.
No you can't get it under the table.
I should go and get the other box and then you've got all the other bits and pieces as well.
 
Where is the box?
Near the window.
Mm I don't know about that.
Which window?
Oh  one where the toys are.
Don't pu don't put it under there then.
Think I'm gonna make a space.
No it probably wouldn't fit under there anyway .
Watch.
go under.
Go on then.
Then I go out and make a space.
I think they're gonna be perfectly happy there.
I shouldn't worry about stories and stuff.
I think they will just get on and get themselves  she can just lay the law down.
Cos it won't matter if they're not in bed till late will it, tonight?
Mm.
Thing is we could do with a lie in in the morning.
What else do we need?
Look, have you seen that.
Been having fun?
I've got a tooth missing now.
Ooh.
Haven't I?
 
You have.
Tell her again cos she weren't listening.
Look, I've got a tooth missing.
Oh.
And that's got a picture.
That's me.
Did you get some money from the tooth fairy?
That's me there.
Can you see .
It's good this isn't it?
You can do it, you don't have to do it in a great long line, you can do it in a sort of  cube or something.
.
Or there's another thing you can  mum we're trying to make that.
We're trying to make a house.
Oh right.
Yeah that'd be good that cos I  I think I've only ever made that once and it was sort of a bit peculiar when you make it.
Yeah.
But anyway you can make it  
We're gonna make it a mess.
Cos that one's got one on.
Oh no.
I don't think I got that on the top like that.
We don't make it all a mess.
Yes you would.
Did I?
You making a mess?
That's it, take it all apart.
I can make a mess.
 
Just a gentle sort of mess .
You know what I mean?
Tim's idea of a mess is to put his hands in it and got shooooo
with it on the way.
so we can clear it up after.
pop.
Yeah look that that's a good idea look.
you don't lose any pieces.
I gonna put this in there.
That's it.
Put it all in one bi big pile.
Oh!
Not a good idea.
No, cos you'll lose them.
Then you won't be able to play with them will you?
Oh look.
Look at that.
Now we need to turn it round.
Erm I'd better get you biscuits and coffee and stuff like that out hadn't I, to ply you with?
Don't you keep away.
Mighty cute.
Tim, can I put this on you before we go.
now  to go on here.
Tim, just come with me up to the toilet  for a minute.
Oh.

Well I just kind of was running round the shop because I was 
You got the first one you could see.
I had to go and collect grandma you see to take her to the station, and I didn't have an awful lot of time so I just sort of ran round and collected whatever I got.
Cos we wouldn't have wanted grandma to miss her train would we?
if we did?
No, bus.
What, miss the train?
No bus?
She'd have to get the next one.
She had to go on a bus actually.
Get the train .

Be a pity.
There's at least one blown over there isn't there?
Oh where?
Oh yeah.
Where?
We'll have to go and collect it, put it in a vase  on the side.
Where's one blown over?
There look.
A new one?
Mm.
Mm.
It's so windy at the moment.
March winds.
The others seem to have stood up quite well over on the other side.
Where?

One of them's dead.
Which one's dead?
The one which is f pointed erm straight ahead.
Mm.
See what you mean.
It's a bit dead.
It is.
Looks as if it  and the wind's got it again.
Mum, it's not very nice when the wind hits it is it mum?
No.
Still, we can always pick them and bring them inside.
I remember doing that once.
I remember 
 
finding one and putting the vase on there.
 
Mm.
So where is it now?
It will be dead by now.
You're talking about last year aren't you?
Last year's flowers aren't around now.

Right.
Thank you.
These are the same bulbs though that have made a new flower this year.
Where's the marmalade?
I took a bit.
Why they keep on making new bulbs?
They do it, well  they do it every year.
Can I have some marmalade please?
Ah.
The daffodils over there in that little bed  seem to be a bit later than all the others, I don't know.
Have some marmalade.
Have some marmalade.
I'm doing it a funny way this time.
I'd of thought they would have got just as much sun  and rain as everything else.
That's a little one.
Mum.
Look what I've done.
marmite.
Mm.
Very posh.
Candles.
Do you usually do that?
If you ask mummy  she'll

Have you got sp lots of spare tapes?
No.

Are they on every week or are they once a fortnight?
 
I'm not sure actually.
And you haven't seen  the  the puppet show.
I haven't seen one about a puppet show.

Mm.
Rosie and Jim mm 
Rosie and Jim went to a puppet show did they?
They go to Stratford.
Yeah a a a and a lion.
Stratford?
Do they?
And there's a lion is there?
And a and a lion .
He took an omelette.

So if it's a puppet show did Rosie and Jim do some puppeting?puppet.
No.
They were in the audience shouting and cheering from what I saw.
Where they?
Mhm.
Then they went round the back though didn't they?
Did they ?
Mm.
They run round the back and played with the  puppets.
When the show was ended 
Nobody mentioned that they were puppets themselves.
That's what I call a miracle.
I do that.
I don't think they like it.
Mm.
It was nice to see Stratford.
I wonder if that  they filmed that at the time when the boat was in Stratford.
Do you remember when we went to
Yeah.
Yeah.
we nearly went to see it but we missed.
Yeah.
Cos it had moved by the time we got there.
So it might be then they might have taped it?
Mm.
It could well have been.
But mum it's a bit late from that.
Well it's always takes a long time.
They  they do these things  months beforehand.
And then it comes on the television  later on.
How to get to know about these things.
Mm.
This chap we were sitting next to involved in all these canal projects  .
Oh yes, that's right.
He was.
Apparently he's a director of various canal preservation bodies and things.
Oh.
He was certainly into canals in a big way.
Yeah.
Yeah he is.

You'll have to get to know i is he in your ?
No, he's at Solihull .
Oh Solihull.

Actually she did very well on one of those .
She did far better 
Did you tell her?
Oh yes.
Yes.
Well I made sure my boss told her, that's .
Cos he was desperate for  cos he needed an answer for Monday morning for Dave.
It's going to be thinking about science.

It might be or it might not.
Mum, is the video on?

I'm not quite sure what happens you see.
That's why
I just pressed but cos there's a little line.
hear the sound of the video.
When?
Well I can hear it now.
Oh.
Yeah I'm wondering whether it's playing to itself, with the television off.
Do you think that's likely?
Or does it not do it?
No, cos it's not got the aerial  it would do.
It would do.
Would it?
Oh dear.
It's not got the aerial in.
No.
Shouldn't 
It is it's on it's on the video.
It's just that I can actually hear it.

It was quite funny when you looked round at the end, you know, and everyone was just getting up 
I know.

looking a bit sheepish and going.
At least we'd arrived.
Yes

I can play.
Yeah, you can play.
What do you want me to do?
What, what have I got to do?
If Geoff, because Geoff is supposed to be playing.
But if Geoff doesn't turn up in a few minutes.
I don't mind.
It's the morning, I can cope..
giving it just a couple more minutes and if he doesn't come
Oh alright.
then it  you know they might have been delayed one way or another.
And then you could perhaps  tinkle the ivories.
Yes, fine.
What are we tinkling?
Well I'm sure it's something fairly easy.
I'll cope, don't worry.
I don't feel worried.
.
He's arrived.
I don't feel worried.
I'm in friends.
I've never seen you in a suit before Barry.
It's my dashing  one

I feel a bit more with it now.
Oh good.
It's since I've met people you know, they all seem jolly.
Oh dear.

Have to change your job again.
Yeah.
I'm enjoying the job.
It's  
Yeah.
If you could just bring it here.
just bring it here.
Yeah.
Like  if you came straight out, what sort of time would you get home then?
You know, if it was sort of five minute's stroll down the road?

We don't know it.
Oh.

We might know it.
We'll be told in a minute  finished.
Round about six o one.
Six o one?
Yeah, the dummy one.
No, I said round about six o one.
Oh right.
That's the page it's open at.
Pick any one on the page.
It can't be that one.
Wait a minute.
Oh I bet it's five nine eight.
What's five nine eight?
Five nine eight?
I don't know.
I'm just guessing.
That would seem to be the sort of thing he was humming.
But then Geoff would know that wouldn't he?
Another erm  psalm looking type one.
That one?
Yes.
Where's Philip?
Is he with us?
No.
Oh.

He rang me up at nine o'clock.
He says I don't think I can quite make it yet you know.
Oh no.
Is he in work then?
Yeah he is in work, yeah.
All night?
No no no.
He went at seven o'clock this morning.
Oh right.
At least somebody's got some work to do.
That's good innit?
Yeah.
I think, I think it was more he thought if he didn't do his clearing up he might get the sack, so
Oh right.
So he had to go and clear up.
That's a good one.
Don't know that one Geoff.
Cliff Richard can't do this, what are you worrying about?worship song.
 

That will do Geoff, for our singing.
What number is it?
Is it ?
that all depends on how the, how he can get that guitar in tune .
 

He has to  he has to do without the rhythm.
I can't cope with it.
In the end I might you know .
You are .
There must be one that set you up.
Six hundred.
Oh.
Wrong again.
morning everybody.
Morning.
Did you sleep well.
Yes.
Jolly good.
Jolly good.
Let's just er begin with a a  a kind of quiet.
Get ourselves into the presence of the lord.
You can't have any.
Why can't I have an egg?
Because that's d Andy's.
Yes.
And that's mine.
Well that's okay, and that's Christopher's.
I'll have an egg without an egg cup.
Oh.
Why?
Well I can have it and just  peel it.
I mean take the  take the skin off it.
I'm not  
Why don't you come in the sitting room with me away from daddy?
And leave Christopher doing a bit of drawing.
Have you had a nice time this morning?
What did you do?
Alright then.
Shall we do it together?
And  gonna be happy when  
This is nice actually.
It's like when you 
I can soon break it.
Why?
Then make it again  
Alright then.
Mum.
Hello.
Could you get me from the shelf the black felt pen?
Which shelf?
The big one with all the  on top.
There's some colours.
There isn't black  felt pen.
Right.
I'll see what I can do.
They've gone now.
Where are they?
These ones?
Yeah.
I need a black one.
Well you can have them all and put the black in when you need it.
Oh excuse me.
In case one of these doesn't work.
I need a red .
Come on.
I'm coming.
Quick.
I can't be in two places at once.
Cut the paper off.
It seems a shame to break it up doesn't it, when it's so good.
Who made this one?
Christopher.
Did you know how 
Oh yeah.
Was it la 
Ellie.
last night when you went to bed?
Yeah.
Ellie came  put us to bed.
That was nice.
Did you enjoy that?
Yeah.
Did you like it?
How we gonna get this off?
We gonna get that off?
This one?
Yeah.
It's a bit stiff.
There you are.
Mm.
How we gonna get that one off.
Don't know, you have to sort of wobble them.
When you wobble them they come off.
Oop.
Ah!
They come off.
Break it.
Oh.
There.
There we are.
Now make it again.
Right.
What shall we make this time?
How shall we start?
A house.
A house?
We need one of these to make it stand up.
Right.
That's the 
Is that the floor?
Yeah cos  where's the story I got ?
Have you got a story?
Yeah upstairs.
I  one.
Oh.
The foundations.
That one about building the house?
Yeah, like ours.
Oh.
It's a different one though cos  this is a big one.
Right.
And that's not a big one in the story.
How's that?
House.
We need some more walls.
some more walls.
Oh that's a good one.
A big tall one.
Let's try that shall we?
Shall we put a roof on?
Yeah there's a roof on here.
How do you do the roof?
That way do you think?
the roof.
. Have to do without the roof.
Have to do that to the 
Then we'll make it come down now  this side.
Are you doing some more whoops a daisy.
Whoops.
If you're going to make it go out that way  then you'll have to make it go out that way at the bottom otherwise it won't fit  when you try to put the other wall up.
Ooh.
And the problem with that one is  is it's not sort of fitting the edge there.
It is.
Look.
Need one of these.
Then this comes down the side look.
Need one of these.
Oh no, that's not right.
Look at that  it's got things sticking out.
Do you think you've got to have it down the edge there, haven't you?
This time.
And how do we fix this on now?
Look, I show you.
Er there 
And could we take this yellow one off  we'll find it fits in like a wall, like that look.
Oh!
That goes on.
try that .
That's good.
Oh.
Oops.
Oh.
I'm gonna make it.
There you are.
Now what are we gonna do with this yellow piece?
I know   
Wonder if we can put that on the bottom, can't we  somewhere?
that be the floor.
Yeah.
This doesn't feel quite right here somehow.
It's all wobbly.
Shall we, just let's see if we can turn this round so it makes it 
We need one of these.
When Ellie did it it didn't seem to fall to pieces like ours is Timothy.
That's it.
We  the floor now.
Is it ready?
Think the eggs probably are but I don't think the whole lunch is yet.
Are you hungry?
Is it possible to lay the table do you think, for me?
I think we might manage that.
It's ready.
I don't mind burnt toast.
Adds to the flavour.
Mm.
Me mum and dad seem to have had trouble with their toaster don't they?
Judging by their letter.
Did you see their toaster?
What make 
Mm.
was it?
I don't remember seeing it.
It was a new one.
they had it.
Where they had it?
No,why they had it .
Why they had it .
Mum.
Well we had it in the evening.
You know when I used to have my
Oh yes .
toast and marmalade and
Was that nice?
But that was where the trouble was because it didn't toast properly.
Because you turned it up to number five  and it was pale.
And turn it down to number one  and it  .
have any of that.
I haven't had either.
Right.
What do you want on yours?
Erm
They're planning on taking it back so  
 
It's the cheese we've been having at work this week  
Mum, help.
It's called dutch.
I've been having it?
You've been having some of that, yeah.
Mm it's nice.
have that bit dad.
Yeah.
The trouble is this has  erm  crusts, sort of rind on it, that's all.
Do you want a piece?
It's called Edam.
It's a bit different from 
We don't usually have Edam do we?
Did I have it with my Marmite?
Yes, you've had it with your Marmite.
That much?
Is that alright?
I want a bit of it.
With my bread.
He's got cream cheese on there dear.
Right.
I like it better with Marmite.
Can I have Marmite and cheese please?
Mum I need some  not just a .
Cos that won't  very good.
I need three more   
Fold it over.
You 
What?
Mum I finished my bit.
Oh!
I can't do it.
Why is there not very much left in?
Because I had it all when we had breakfast.
Anyway, we've had it a lot haven't we?
 
We've had Marmite a lot.
I had it  for my dinner at school a lot actually.
Mm.
Mm.
Dad  
Right, what's on the agenda for this afternoon then?
Dad, it's not all over.
What's that?
What's that?
Mum, what's that?
It looks like a sandwich going up and down to me.
No.
It's a  lid.
It's a lid.
Oh.
What about you?
A rest I suppose.
I dunno really.
My body feels inactive, but my mind feels  fed up,.
this week.
Dad, I like the cheese better than the Marmite.
That's why I like Saturday's and
Potter about.
Do the garden or  walking or whatever it is.
Something very different.
Why did you toast  bread?toast.
No, there won't be any more now.
And that dozen in our garden can't decide  which way to face.
Have you noticed?
Cos in the morning they get the sun from that direction, then they don't see the sun again for a bit and then it turns up suddenly from over there.
They don't know whether to face over there or over there.
Mum.
Hello.
What  and then we had a lot of biscuits.
Did you?
Why?
I don't know why.
talking about Monday.
Monday?questions.
I know what it is.
What?
Questions on Monday.
I know what it is.
What is it?
Oranges.
You're right.
It is oranges.
They've been sitting there for over a week  
I just see the orange.
Well they were meant to go in a chicken but it never happened.
It's oranges, I guessed it.
I knew  
I was going to do chicken a l'orange.
 
It's my turn.
But you weren't here so I thought ooh, blow this for a lark.
I can see  black.
Oh.
Sorry for that.
No I don't know what that is.
Red.
Yes.
And that's black.
Red.
I I guessed the oranges.
That's right.
Half each.
Mm.
Good idea.
No, one each.
One each.
One each?
No.
Too big.
They're huge. 
We'll be having half each.
Half!
Mm.
Because they're rather large.
Do you want to peel them?
If you peel one I'll peel the other.
Okay.
If  if you  peel that one
Mm?
that's my friend mummy.
Your friend am I?
That's nice.
Am I a friend too?
We're all friendly together.
I'm I'm mummy's friend and daddy's friend and  
That's nice isn't it?friends.
Oh that's  friendly family.
All friendly.
Do you like everyone as well mum?
I do like everyone, yes.
I like everybody very much  
If  if mummy do that one 
Well I'll do one and mummy does the other one.
Yeah.
And you can  share it up.
And you share it up.
Yes.
They both have .
Oh,me.
Tim, put your hands over your eyes.
No.
Those satsumas we had or whatever they were  clementines were  they were quite nice for tea all this week.
Have you had one?
very difficult to peel.
One day I had them and they were full of pips.
Oh.
Did you have that problem?
Oh no we've never had that problem.
Mm.
Have you 
I've had that problem.
With lots of pips in?
Mm.
Did you have one at school with lots of pips in?
Mm.
Sorry about that.
Oh.
You just couldn't tell from the outside.
Beg your pardon.
I had that problem once.
I kept looking in mine when I  when I had it once I thought ooh.
And now I'm going to have a look in my orange before I eat it.
Very wise.
So I don't know whether this one will have pips in it, so be careful.
Daddy.
I would think the oranges will have pips in won't they?
Usually do.
Oh they usually do.
I think these have pips in.
Mm.
Orange pips are slightly bigger than satsuma pips so you can see them.
Yeah but sat the satsuma pip was really big.
They were quite big.
Actually I got it in my mouth.
Did you?
That's alright.
You spit it out again did you?
Yeah.
Mum what's that hard thing?
half.
everybody was eating 
Do other people get satsumas at school?
half please.
No.
Yeah.
No?
What do they have?
Half.
Sorry.
Dad  give them into little bits.
Just check there's no pips Tim.
Yeah.
And I'll check mine.
You're checking yours are you?
I'll check mine myself.
All I do is look in the  
I think there's no pips in mine.
Just as well innit?
Seeing's you've eaten it.
Whoops careful.
Slow down a bit.
Just go slowly Tim.
Yes.
Cos they're big slices, it's not like satsumas.
Chew them properly.
Daddy.
Yes.
You  you do this.
Mm.
You you you do this   you you suck 
No I'm not suck it I just eat it.
I rescued you  
Mrs  and Mrs  and Mrs  don't cut them properly.
Don't they?
If I had an orange mum
Mhm.
and they cut it all that 
They leave the skin on?
You don't have to eat the skin, surely?
No, but all they do, they leave the orange in the skin.
Oh I see, they don't peel it.
And you have to suck it out?
Oh.
That's probably cos it would take them too long to  peel everybody's oranges wouldn't it?
There's no skin on yours.
I think this one's got pips in.
Oh.
They're nice aren't they?
Mm.
Do you have Mrs  and Mrs  then with your class?mm  just Mrs .
No.
Mm.
What we do
Mm.
is we go to another class
Mm.
and we  
 
Ah I see, right.
So two classes come together and you all, each have a dinner lady?
And yours is Mrs .
Theirs is Mrs .
Got it now.
It's got a pip in.
Mm.
Well put it that bit then in there.
Mum, none of mine had pips in.
And mine .
Nice taste .
Very nice.
Mum.
It's nicer than a satsuma really.
It is.
Got more  faff 
What else is there?
What else is there?
Mm.
I'll have a look and see what else there is.
You might find some biscuits in the biscuit tin.
Is it biscuits again?
Oh.
See what daddy finds.
Mum  I didn't like  did I?
I didn't have a home made one because I had a very funny tummy didn't I?
But I haven't had one once and it tasted really nice.
Oh what we gonna have?
What we gonna have?
Er what we going to have mum?
What we gonna have dad?
Cloth by the sound of the water.
What?
We're going to have a cloth by the sound of the water.
I think I .
Yeah I think daddy's just erm making sure we haven't got such sticky fingers after our oranges I think.
Then we'll have a biscuit.
Can you pass me a cup please?
I want to wash my hands first cos . 
I'll have the next round.
Tim you haven't washed your hands yet.
I have.
When?
Now.
Then daddy
Thank you.
Yes?
You can keep this if you like.
Right, thank you.
You can have it if you want.
I've already washed my hands.
Oh.
 

Where's he going?
Toilet?
 

He's only had three drinks.
You definitely pay the penalty don't you, for leaving your children?
Cos other people say you don't do things your way.
It must be a problem if people sort of leave their children in nurseries all the time cos  it's nice for a short time but  for a long long time  they're just not yours are they any more?
Yeah.
It seems a pity but it's not for very long.
He's been chucked out a lot recently hasn't he?
He has yeah.
That's why I'm feeling as if I ought to stay in tonight really.
What do you think?
Think I'm just chickening out?
I think it's a bit of both.
I am chickening out cos I don't feel as if I've  learnt an awful lot.
Yeah.
Well do you want to chicken out?
Instead.
I think I ought to go.
Why?
I ought to go.
Why?
You've said you'll go.
Just because you've said you'll go or because you think ?
I think  
 
possibly.
Even though I have heard it all before.
And do you think I ought to go then?
Well I mean there might well be something 
I don't mind.
Well there might be.
But I can understand 
gripping and of interest but at the same time  my priorities at this moment 
 
got a pip in.
It's gone now.
It doesn't seem very fair.
Fair on who?
Him.
Oh here.
You alright?
Oh it's here it's wet.
I wondered what that was there.
Must be the oranges do you think?tipped out of your .
Considering everything put together like  your tiredness  your children
Mm.
not a tremendous amount new  just to get there   
Oh!
It is with this one.
I haven't seen him for two days.
 
 
I might feel differently by five o'clock mind you.
But you ought to let Dawn know .
That's true.

You've had six million biscuits already.

What else have we got in here?
We've got some plastic bags.
A very fine acrobat.
It needs a bit of sellotape there doesn't it?
Mm.
Do you want to sellotape him up?
I like this bit.
Oh I like his mouth.
That's good.
How did you do that?
Actually
Mm.
I  a bit like this

and if you look carefully on this you'll find some of those.
There's one mum.
Oh.
Oh yes I see.
There's a great big 
Yeah.
.
We could hang this up.
We could do.
If you get it st erm stuck down properly we can .
Or I could make it into a puppet.
How did you get this stick then?
Did you have to saw this stick?
Mm.
That's good innit?
Which end did you saw?
This bit?
Well I  did it  well that's a bit straight isn't it?
Mm.
It might be that one.
I thought it would be that one cos you'd be a bit wobbly wouldn't you with your sawing?
Or were you straight with your sawing?
Straight but mum we had a very straight thing which sta stood on the table very hardly and 
Right.
You clamped it down did you?
You need some sellotape just there round that arm.
On that hand.
Away you go.
See what you can do.
Round that?
No that one's alright, that one's stuck.
It's just this one.
Well you can hold it .
Look .
Mm very good.
We can hang it up.
We could hang it  over the stairs instead of that fish.
We'll take the fish down  put the clown up instead.
Whoops.
It's an acrobat.
Oh, beg his pardon.
The acrobat up instead.
can he swing over?
No, not really.
Yes he can.
Ooh!
Oh
It would be better if he was stuck on properly.
Then we could swing him over.
Another sticking session.
A  session.
A sticking .
I've lost my cup of coffee.
What did I do with it?
It was when you were playing with it with your fingers, do you remember?
Anyway it won't matter.
We can use some pliers or something to  bend it back.
  

Hello hello hello hello
  

Mummy this is for winter this isn't it?
Hello.
Your er ?
Yes.
I don't suppose we could have it  
For  for the chilly days.
Well in the summer you won't need jumpers will you like this?
No.
Hopefully.
If we have a good summer.
Mind you in the evening, if it gets quite chilly in the evenings so it might be a good jumper to wear in the evenings when we go for our  evening walks by the sea.
Oh what a lovely thought daddy.
  

Next time we go to the sea.
Oh it's the clip.
He's been playing with it, he's bent it out so it .
It's on at the moment though.
I tried doing it with my fingers but 
I don't know.
Thank you dear.
Very helpful.
Very helpful.
Oh.
Mum, what about giving him something for being very  
Giving who something?
What do you mean?
Here, I'm gonna whisper you something.
Go on.
  

Give you what?
Why?
  

Oh I see.
Oh right.
Biscuits.
No no.
Nothing to do with biscuits.
Right.
We'll have to go 
Nothing to do with biscuits.
do we need to go upstairs first?
Er, I think we should.
Come on.
Chips.
Chips.
I think we should have chips, don't you?
MacDonalds.
Mac 
Erm  have you got the purse mummy?
Erm  I don't know.
Have you got some money?
I haven't got any money .
It's alright.
I've got loads of money somewhere.
It's just a matter of 
It's stopped raining.
Good.
Has John got a new car do you think?
Oh well I saw that on Friday.
In fact yesterday we said I wonder if he's got a new car or  whether he's got visitors.
I should imagine it's a new car.
Very posh isn't it?
Is it new?
I mean
It's J reg is it?
  

I I I I told you to.
  

Will it fit in the garage?
It's a bit bigger than our  ford escort.
It won't mummy.
I don't think it will.
If it doesn't mum  anyway it wouldn't fit in the garage because there's another car in there.
Oh that's a point.
That's a bit tricky.
Well we think that that might be a new car.
Yeah, we think it's  
.
cos we're nearly there.
We're not nearly there.
We haven't even started .
Nearly there.
Got to be quick.
did you actually go to sleep mummy?
I did.
Did you?
I was absolutely whacked out.
You've done very well .
Well I haven't.
You've done all the meals.
Dad, could you walk it to MacDonalds?
Well you could.
It would be a little bit far for us.
But we could if we needed to.
Wouldn't be too bad cos you'd go down by the Jolly Farmer.
Yeah.
You'd have to walk like Gemma walks to school wouldn't you?
Mm.
Where does Gemma live?
Gemma lives   Oakenshaw 
Yeah, near MacDonalds.
Near MacDonalds dad.
She lives right near MacDonalds doesn't she?
She does actually.
Wonder if she goes to MacDonalds every night for her tea?
No.
But she could walk it from her house couldn't she?
She could.
Because it's not far.
Yeah all she has to do is go  go round her bit  round just a normal road, across the road  down a little bit  and she's there.
Mm.
It's not very far daddy, is it daddy?
A teeny  bit.
It's only round the corner  from her isn't it mum?
It's only .
I found it  over here.
I can't see it.
There it is.
There it is.
There's a lot of people there.
Do you think we'll get a seat?
Ooh there's a lot of cars.
I see MacDonalds.
There's not normally that many people there are there?
No.
It's
What?
it's a bit full.
Oh it looks crowded.
Perhaps there's a party.
It's not a party.
Perhaps there's only one person in each car at MacDonalds.
That's true.
I can't think that one person in a car on their own would want to go to MacDonalds too often.
Like a mum or a dad or  
Everybody must have thought what a dismal day this is.
Mm.
Let's got to MacDonalds for our tea.
Mm it is quite full though.
How do you know which way 
It is.
Are we gonna get i I don't think we're gonna get in.
Course we are.
What?
I've never known it that full before.
Where to park?
There's a space.
There aren't any spaces.
Well just keep going round.
There was some space at the other end actually.
There's a space.
Just missed a space.
I don't think we did Tim .
No there weren't any.
No.
I think there's one just over here.
Oh 
How you  space?
Where?
There.
That's the one I saw when I was coming in.
Don't know if you're meant to use it.
Well 
Are those  erm queuing up though?
Yeah.
Oh.
I'd better get out this side I think.
Why?
No, your side I mean.
Cos it's flowers and things.

I'll go round the door.
Appearances at noon and three PM.
I thought the man was dead.
I'm going out here.
Who is dead?

Isn't he dead, Ronald MacDonald?
Or perhaps it's sort of some dressed up character.
Don't!
Okay.
Are you coming Christopher or are you going to sit here to have your meal?
Just wait Tim cos there's lots of cars.
I just going go round.
Well just go and stand on that path there cos there's another  another car then.

It hasn't got holes in it has it?
Where's the holes?
It has.
It has hasn't it?
Yeah it's got loads of holes.
Er you could do with something to hold it with or else you're gonna get into a terrible terrible mess.

Mum it's gonna take ages to eat these.
It's gonna take ages to eat these mum  dad.
Mm.

Depends how long you want for it to take.
Do you want a cup of tea daddy?
Another  cup of tea, or a coffee?
This thing, is it on, off?
Has it been on?
It's not been on, no, I've just switched it on.
Right,toast and marmite, times two.
I think everything on this erm, machine is to do with food, don't you?
Probably is.
You need to sort of stop and talk when you have food.
Yes  .
Yes please  cup of tea  are making it then?good!
I did manage to sort out  the food for tomorrow and
Did you  really?
That's very clever!
Well I thought .
Did you manage to do alright?
Yeah.
Found .
I mean pinched one of  for starters, that makes a difference.
Did you try it did you?
No !
Ah ho,
A pathetic film on, I don't 
Ah!
know what it was about, but it was pathetic!
Ah!
Mm.
What's happening tomorrow?
What do you mean, what's happening tomorrow?
Well what is it tomorrow morning and evening and things.
What?
What is it tomorrow morning and evening, and what are we going to do in the afternoon without ?
!
I know we'll cope but what are you going to do?
  
Are we inviting anyone?
I know we're not inviting anybody for lunch Christmas day  couldn't cope with that but it would be quite to have them   in the afternoon    can't cope with the people!
Oh yeah.
Suppose we should do something, yeah.
Well that's what I was thinking, perhaps we could go with somebody somewhere.
You know, like by a canal or something.
Perhaps, well if it's snowing it won't be quite the same.
That's right.
Conducive to tripping about!
But if it's quite nice weather, it would be nice to invite somebody along  I expect.
They could just  .
Stratford?
Yeah  the Stratford Warriors   running about every  six weeks  something like that.
Is it six weeks since we saw the last one then?
They didn't, they we , they have them more frequently now and they're getting even more and more infrequent now for the rest of the year.
Mm.
And  next one .
That's Mother's Day  twenty second.
Is it?
No.
Mother's Day a fortnight
Twenty ninth.
Somebody will organize a party for Tuesday  
Yeah they want a party piece on Tuesday.
It's alright you don't have to,of cake.
If I don't bake them now  my mother.
Yeah well tell your mother.
I'll have to 
Yeah I will.
get one!
And it better be a nice one!
Pop into Marks and Spencers they have some  amazing shapes in Marks and Spencers that the children will enjoy.
Really?
Mind you it might be expensive.
Tesco's are probably cheaper.
You remember that Tom and Jerry I got for Tim?
Because I couldn't be bothered to cook it.
Well, leave it up to me, I'll see what I can get  I'll get   for the party.
Thank you dear.
Is that alright?
Yeah.
I'll get you some.
And I'll just make the rest of the  with salad in.
You're not supposed to .
I've told you what we're gonna for Christopher haven't I?
I know, he went to school  to do 
Yeah.
housework.
Is that naughty?
Thursday morning.
Right, Christopher  will be back too!
I wish I could   I'd like to 
You what?
Out at the meeting again on Monday night.
On Monday?
Where are you going Monday?
Going to Sue's house.
Oh right  the big  housewife!
The housewife  mhm.
like cooking this week.
Ah, I'm having Jane for a piano lesson, aren't I?
What day?
Which day?
Monday.
Are you?
Oh well 
So that fits in quite well  I couldn't remember what I was doing on Monday  but we said, sort of tentatively Monday would be probably quite a good day  I think.
Better than Thursday anyway.
So could Tuesday night be Inspector Morse night?
Yeah cos my mum will be here then.
Oh right  can we not take her home?
Unpaid !
Well she'll 
We shall see!
have been here all day, won't she?
So she might want to go home!
she wants to tell us all about her wedding 
Could you tell her we're going to watch Inspector Morse!
for the third or fourth time!
Will she have watched Inspector Morse?
She won't of watched it, cos it's bound to be on a Wednesday night!
Does she like Inspector Morse?
I don't think she watches it normally.
No, she probably doesn't like it.
A bit spicy!
I bet she would, she loves anything like that!
Bit of a body!
Mind you, it might be  too complicated!
It was  I remember reading in the paper  that it's been  it's been filmed at a house  which no one 's ever been allowed to go in  even the great  sort of  one of these country mansions, it was not  Bradley Hall 
Right.
And  even people who write about  
If it was not  Bradley Hall , it can't be  Bradley Hall again, they're always going in there !
Well that's fine.
It was some country mansion in Oxfordshire  you know?
Mm.
It's as you come off the 
And how did 
and 
they get permission then?
They somehow managed to persuade the owners, apparently it was  and it was  and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place  not even  erm historians who write about famous buildings, even they had been refused access!
Where is it?
Somewhere in Oxfordshire.
Oh!
They don't know where?
Oh  .
So
this was about last week's episode?
I think it was about last week's epi , but they seem to e imply that it was last week's episode that would
Oh.
do it.
We seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before Wednesday.
Alright.
Well that's the only chance.
Oh yeah cos we're going to Maryland tomorrow.
your dad.
Mm.
Erm  not it wasn't about your dad, it was about my birthday  cos 
Cos yo 
he'd realized that it was my birthday, and wha , what did I want?
So I said send me a cheque and I'll go and shop.
And?
And   last week cos she's  quite generous isn't she?
She is a bit but it's .
No, I didn't say anything.
I think that's the thing.
So your dad sent a cheque.
Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your dad, and she has heard from your dad  apparently on Friday  he went  to the  consultant
Mm.
and next week he's got his first  well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now.
Mm.
I don't know how long it's going to go on for, or what it is exactly but I thought  it would be a good idea to ring your dad up  and see.
Mm.
But at least things have moved, and at least they've gone round.
So I'm pleased really, are you?
Interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't it?
After seeing him, because he thought that once  he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to  get the treatment started, but they must have got themselves over that.
Yeah.
Well I mean everyone .
Yeah.
I think .
Gotta get moving.
And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him  has had tha , upset that thrombosis again.
I don't know whether to ring him tonight, oh it's too late tonight now.
It's much too late.
Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up?
Well they love talking to them on the phone don't they?
I know they do.
We could can prime them up on what to say  and types of things to talk about  so they don't get  moaned down or something !
Bogged down !
So he's had to go in, what did you say?
Three times a week?
I don't know  she just said 
Something like that
a few times a week  and I think it sounded like three  cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything.
Mm  a trial!
Well  I hope not  I mean no he won't be able to drive 
 
but presumably your mum can do that for, they've got hundreds of people there, he's always driving people everywhere 
That's right.
so I don't see why they can't drive him!
I'm sure they will 
Yes.
cos they're very good aren't they?
I mean look at that woman doing her  er   from the  from the church.
At times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer  could help out.
It would nice if we lived there but we can't so  
It's  about .
And write as well.
Yes.
Double dose.
Yes.
And pulled out.
Well it's sort of pulled out, but at least it's .
We'll be paying for it as well.
And it's hard as well.
We've been paying anyway, so it must of  you know.
What does erm  you see  er  Eileen's   and she's having chemotherapy isn't she?
By me , by medication, is 
 
that right?
Well she takes all these tablet things.
That's right  she has a sort of  massive dose every now and then.
And that makes her feel  what?
She's not in pain  is she?
More sort of  dopey.
I wouldn't care if they made me dazed  
Yeah.
!
Yeah.
I dunno.
Not gonna  
Difficult to know.
Oh yes, that was it!
I wonder how bad it is, that feeling's like, we don't really know  how bad it is do we?
No.
Perhaps he will be able to say, you know?
But whether he'd tell us over the telephone,you think ask.
I think he would wouldn't he?
I think so.
What do you want on your toast?
here's Marmite.
Right, shall I give the marmalade to you then?
Yes  can we have
Watch your arm there!
Marmite?
Which half do you want?
And marmalade.
Do you want some marmalade on it?
Yeah.
Which half do you want the marmalade on?
That on?
Are you feeling alright before you sort of?
That one?
Oh I see.
Daddy don't  shout because  I   when it's  and then am I allowed  .
Mm.
I would be like that.
Will you?
And I'll be
Do you want me to spread it for you?
Yeah  I want some milk?

Just one.

Don't know if you'll see it over there, I think you might have to be in the light.
Here look  inside here  it's meant to be bonsai trees but I don't know whether I'll ever remem materialize.
Somebody gave us one for Christmas.
Can you see?
If you look very carefully you can just see a couple of little green shoots starting to come.
I can only see one, I can't see another.
Oh 
Mum  
I can see one in a big lump.
You sit down.
One in a big lot?
Big one  but I can only see that.
Mummy!
Hello!
Sit down because I  
There's a green looking spot there.

Yes.
You sit down!

Oh.
Mum, is it meant to be a tree when it grows up?
You
Well 
you coming back?
it's meant to be a bonsai tree which looks like a tree but it's only very small  like that high.
But at the moment I think there's lots and lots of seeds.
I think there could be about fifteen trees in there, so far.
That fish came zooming up to the top then, to see what you were doing.
Oh.
Now then Tim, not too much, alright?
These are fish, not sharks.
Go on.
Ha ha!

I was just walking back to go  and he'd got a
Oh right.
Chris wanted to  into me on purpose.
On purpose!
He was looking where he was going!
These are .
And he said it was my fault, but it wasn't!
Was it mummy?
Well I don't, I presume it wasn't.
Need a bin..
Mind you, if you were going the same way as he wanted go, and he was going the way you wanted to go 
Need a bin.
and nobody wanted to move, then you would bang, and it 
Need a bin!
would be both people's fault.
You do need a bin, you're right, it's over there.
Is she in the  
Darren just 
, Mummy!
And also I was telling  
Well that's  
Mummy!
what he was doing too.
If you look after these, and I 
I'll look after those.
with the bin.
And while you're at it with the bin get yourself a tissue as well, to wipe your nose.
The trouble is, you see, if Christopher's doing what he wants to do, you're doing what you all want to do  and then both  both of you crash in the middle  it's nobody's fault particularly is it?
It  I didn't go like that.
Well what you've got to do, you've both got to learn.
I was  I was  there 
You've both got to learn 
and I was there  Jemima was there  I was there, and Jemima there
Mm.
Chris was there
Mm.
and I went round there and he went straight into me.
Oh there we go.
I suspect that one day, you'll both learn to look where you're going  and both move  out of the way.
Can you get a nice .
So nobody is to back .
Well I didn't  him coming, and Ian saw me coming.
Are you going to get that aeroplane?

I couldn't find  can't find any books  on 
What books?
well you know  we've been reading stories, little ones, that was only two I could find but there weren't any stories

Oh it doesn't what you 
or something like that.
But these are 
what you mean the 
the only ones that I've found  well they were , that was all.
I don't care what it was, it was just kind of, you know, a story that  they might know.
Can you do it cos they're not  
No, there we go.
I'll take that 
just happened to be the children's, that's all.
Does that matter?
I mean I'll bring them back again.
I suppose as long as you bring them back, it won't matter.
Yeah.
As long as they don't want to borrow them  .
Yeah.
Cos I thought it wasn't very fair to lend out the children's stuff 
No.
I suppose for  hours  cos I had loads from when I was teaching so wi that, I've donated those cos  our own children would never get to mark them.
Oh well ma , we were considering  ooh we got a green Jesus here!
A green face.
 
cos    like that but

Try and give her a red nightie.
That's the sky  it's all
No, that's supposed to be what he's thinking look  he's got little blobs coming from his head.
Why?
Cos he's thinking about Jesus.
I think he's going to the dentist or something, and he's a bit frightened  so he thinks, he thinks of that.
What's the matter Christopher?
And you get  a lot  
I don't need to  do all of this from an actual point

It'll be interesting in the year two thousand and ninety to look back and see what we used to do in the nineteen nineties.
I should think I'll be dead just then!
I don't think I'll be around then 
Well you won't 
somehow!

Alright.

It varies  considerably  you can have eight  you can up to fourteen  except fifteen  why, how many do you want in ?
No, it's alright cos someone's rung up from home,say be in eight o'clock, so  she wants to do something.
Right.
She said ooh, you know  can I  invite a couple of friends, can I invite sort of you know, people back to lunch  but when it's sort of  the list  I mean, cos I  I'm not 
Invite .
Well I've got to know, cos sort of   adult as well, I mean you included as   I mean it's to put 
Getting a bit long?
Yes !
I'd invite them 
Yes, I mean it's her sort of age.

Well that's  you know what I mean, it's got the .
It's more cosy!
And at home.
  
If she wants  her sister ,
No, yeah but on the day  no, on the day
When is it?

Erm  
I know that, but will you make it stick .
Yes, oh well.
Can you be a path finder leader on the Sunday because

No, you know what I mean?
But, if you can  you know agree to tell him  
 
And the   
But I'll find them, and you won't have any bother.
Oh I know, but I mean sort of there, I don't know she would actually when it comes to it, but if we see her up there  cos we can do the  
It's nice to see erm  Michael and Sophie 
Yeah.
Actually it's quite a cosy group, so they probably know each other by 
yeah.
now then.
yeah.
Looks a bit agitated!
But anyway 
 
that's somebody that would  would be  a few 
Telling everyone about her mum and dad when they   and erm  how she talked to her mum about that, and it helped her .
But her mum  I mean I know  
 
cos I mean, I know her mum.
She  
Well vaguely, but  
Are they moving to  to be with someone else  or
I don't know, I mean I don't 
But perhaps he doesn't want to change till  cos she'll  
Yeah but she 
so whether they think, well so it's after six months,
Well 
I dunno. 
Is that alright?
They were, they were really nice.
I hate  being sick and one thing another  well, it turned out  
Yeah you do.
Yeah.
Sophie was supposed to be doing the chorus  so I grabbed Mary, and said come with me on the  half way through, called Sophie  why are you doing all the talking Dot  and not Mary!
Cos she 
Cos she's supposed to be Andy!
Oh !
So, Sarah had a job to do, but it wasn't, sort of, till the end, and we're gonna finish too quickly because normally we have it    like Paul and Helen  being really with it  and  look  there's sort of upward
Oh no!
and then down below there's Helen  you know  Christopher and 
Yeah 
then Laura's with him.
But none of them turned up to today  so   
Actually can you really face the  from the other   pathfinders 
Mm  cos she'll see you there.
Cos  we're having, not problems, but at school it really   it's unfortunate because she was put in a third year, and she's only a third year now  and she was on a third year class last year.
Who else is there with her in there?
They're all
Well we've actually chose the brownies now  her age.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it really hit her this year, we felt quite disgruntled 
Yeah.
that I really    but I mean last year   still not finished   !
She's really funny !
So we had a laugh ov , well   said he  when he woke up, he said day one  you can do three on one day    !
Mind you, she's like that, better get 
When you're feeling keen I said, you can do a lot and then  
They're rather weed, I know my two even .
 
erm  rather than 
I suppose cos he's done that at school
Yeah, that's right!
they come home they've gotta snuggle up in bed with a book 
Yeah.
you know, or  Patrick's into psalms , she loves poetry   
 
psalms ,I thought !
Why not!
I used to do it, oh what psalm is it she ?
I've forgotten, about being in mud  was it a ?
Ri , she did it .
Yeah.
But as they do, it's gonna hit her cos it's not year that  it doesn't help, see if she's in a third year class, she was always  as she is now, in the top of that, but even 
That's right.
when she was only a second year   therefore  that means, she's not given enough work, but I mean 
I know what you mean.
She's sort of got  with children then because this erm  testing, they've got to  a school work outside 
curriculum.
they've go , that's it,the they do have to take them on to 
ta 
the next  
I mean 
Yeah  well she's sort of with the third year and will admit  she's so fed up!
But I, I'm 
Oh yeah.
there's a lot of   !
I mean I'm glad she's  er September , and an August birthday, I would of hated to have gone
Well I'm glad of that  my children  cos all 
Yeah.
mine are like that,
 
and  it does mean that they can relax  you know  about  work and everything
Yeah.
cos you know  they're  a million times ahead.
They've got an extra .
Yeah  haven't got to worry.
all of them  so when  her class came up, cos she'd been with the class  right from nursery  and  when she put into this  you know, with the double third year, cos they go upstairs for third and fourth year  and they really do   classes below  she didn't know anything in the class!
No!
I mean er  she , they weren't
No  I suppose er  it's a bit hard on th , the kid, sort of, work wise, expecting her to be her to be er  ahead, but not
But friends means such a lot don't they, at that age?
Yeah.
They see .
Oh right  yeah.
We've got , we've still not got it yet!
Oh, you've got the !

bag.
You're still hurting, oh dear!
There's nothing in the bag!
I think we'll have a quiet day today between us.
What about this library story time?
Are you capable of getting to the library  Christopher?
So we take Chri , Timothy to the story time and then you stay with me and we'll potter around  the shops and the little library.
Actually that'll be quite good cos that'd be nice to see whether you can  get out and about without keeling over!
And then you can come home and have a rest when you've been.
Mum!
Yeah.
.
I don't go to school .
To school you mean?
I thought we might just keep an eye open for Margaret and Beth 
Beth!
walking up the road, we can tell them.
Ooh!
Oh!
If we see her walking up the road we can  tell her, and if we don't, we'll give them a ring  later on.
Oh!
There you go, arm in.
That's James!
Is it?if it was James  to give them a message at school.
It might be, I don't think it is James.
Certainly somebody singing and dancing.
Er no it isn't James.
No!
Mhm.
But I,
 
I even saw my plectrum.
Did you, where?
It's not in my guitar.
Oh  where is it then?
It's  I see this.
Be on the floor somewhere, it usually is!
Come on  pop an arm in here.
We found our bag !
I don't think we'd lost it had we?
No !
It is 
Cor!
on the floor!
Mm.
What bag's that for?
Well we took  erm  mums and toddler  erm  what's it's?
Tea towels  innit, on Thursday.
I   went there then  he won't be with the church  I went to scramblers.
Yes you did, that was yesterday when we went to church and scramblers, but Christopher didn't go to  cos he wasn't very well was he?
That's !
It was a good job I didn't go because I would be sick there.
Yeah, we didn't want you being sick in .
And you went 
Because
home!
it's a good job I went home cos I got  sick at home.
You did didn't you?
It's not in here  and it's not in 
 
the guitar.
Good  and then you went fe , worse again in the afternoon didn't you?
It's not in the guitar  oh!over here.
I think we'll just have a nice quiet day today  erm  there's a little bit of a snag because I don't quite know what we're going to do about all these children that like to go to the library.
We usually have them all in the car.
Where's my plectrum now?
I don't know where your plectrum is, I expect it's on the floor somewhere waiting for my hoover to get it!
No!
I want it for my guitar!
Well it's alright I'll keep my eyes open and if I see it I'll pick it up.
No, I want to spin it.
Have to remind me cos 
What does he want?
I have to  go do on the floor 
 
Right, have you done your teeth this morning sunshine?
And  I haven't.
You haven't, right well go and do yours then, then we'll know it's done.
He  he hasn't.
Yes he has, he's just been up there to do them cos he thought he might be going to school  now he's decided he's not so we'll put the school clothes away again.
It's all very tricky to know isn't it?
Whether to go or not.
It's  and it's a bit of a  an exhausting day if you don't feel too well.
Mum why did you  bring some more clothes?
I didn't 
Whoops!

Yesterdays from erm, when you laid down on .
I'm gonna  see where my plectrum  my plectrum   no, it's not in there.
Have we seen Margaret coming along yet?
I've not seen them.
No, I haven't either.
You keep your eyes open, see if you can see her.
Will you see her from down there?
Tim would you like to come and do your teeth?
Please.
Not yet!
Why do they call her Margaret?
Well that's her name, ha!
I expect her mum called it her, when she was a little baby.
Right Tim, watch my lips  please could you go upstairs  and  clean your teeth?

How's this  and put it over there.
Come on love.

It's the pegs in there.
And what's fallen off?
These.
Well not all trees  lose their leaves.
Why kind of leaves it  what leaves never ever
Well they just sort of drop off when they die and then  grow some new ones  but they don't  drop them all off like all  some of the other trees do  in the Autumn.
They don't, sort of, do it all together.
They can't   but it's nice  
I know.
and it's  they do come up cos then you can see them below can't 
Yeah.

That's true  and it looks very fresh in the spring.

It's not winter?
Well  it's supposed to be officially  winter until the twenty first which is  soon.

Fifteenth at the moment  six days  but spring is really just when new things begin to grow and  they're definitely beginning to grow now.

Used to  his head.
No!
How many spots then?

One, two, three 
Three.

It's nice that  isn't it?
Yes.
Oh look, somebody's chopped a daffodil head off!
Where?
Here look.
Isn't that sad!
Where?
Can you see it in the grass.
One's fallen over.
Oh, I think somebody's picked it and thrown it down.
There's one it  in the .
Mhm.
Isn't there?
Yep.
Are they  I got more  but not when you  in here.
Why is it water  and not here
Why is water there and not here?
Well probably it's not dried up over there 
 
but it has here.
Why?
Well lots of things  dry up water don't they?
The sunshine dries it up  and sometimes it depends on what it's  use  how deep it is  as to whether it dries up.
Oh ha!
 
 
Boo!
Oh here's the dustbin men  doing their bit.
Where?
Here.
Is that dustbi bin men?
He's collecting all the rubbish bags into a big pile.
Mum, is it  lunch time?
No love, it's not lunch time.
Are you hungry?
I think you must be getting better, myself.
I'm hungry because I haven't had  lunch.
Well you didn't eat anything yesterday did you, except half a hot cross bun which is a funny thing to eat, but never mind!
Because I  wanted to  having another one  but I  
You fell asleep!
Oh !
 
I didn't!
You did, you went were fast asleep!
You ate your hot cross bun and then you fell fast asleep on the settee.
 
Who?
This  dinner.
Oh yes!
Are you alright?
 
Yes  it's ready for anything!
Yeah he seems to be.
Mummy, my head hurts!
Your head hurts?
Over there.
Oh dear!
I thought that might happen 
 
as we got a bit nearer to the library.
Well not to worry cos we're nearly there so we can have a sit down 
you got a headache.
You sit down and have a rest, and we'll pop in the chemist and get some Calpol, cos we're running out.
And a dose of Calpol will sort you out  and a nice rest when we get home.
Good job 
Yes.
we didn't go to school after all, isn't it?
What?
Good job we didn't go to school after all, cos you'd of run round in the playground, you'd of been shattered!oops, too late!
What's that bin?
I don't know  it's a bin!
Well why is the bin over there?
I don't know, it looks as if it's got some grit in it for when it gets icy  I suppose you have to put he grit down there.
But there's only one plate mum   in the ground.
But Teddy's still 
Mm.
sad!
Teddy's still sad?
I don't know what you're gonna do to cheer him up.
No.
You'll have to give him lots of love.
didn't he?
He normally gets to  .
This door's open.
Mhm.
I can .
Did you?
Another dream?
Mm.
What was that?
A funny one this time, or a scary one?
It was a dream that Mrs  was there again.
Mrs  !
Mm.
Well what did Mrs  say ?
It's not   about her.
It was the morning then   coming  .
Oh I see !
And what did she do?
Was it a nice day?
Everything go funny?
What?
Sometimes in dreams everything goes most peculiar doesn't it?
But it wasn't very sad.
No, it was a pleasant dream.
Sometimes dreams are quite pleasant, you think, ooh I like that dream, I'd like that one again.
It never quite works out like that.
No because you forget it in the end 
Oh yeah 
lots of dreams like that.
that's right .
Because when you remember it, it might come again.
Yeah !
Then you remember it and it  starts to come a bit true doesn't it?
Mm mm.
   
Well  I don't think they come true really  it just sort of feels real.
   
Mm.
   
Sometimes you can wake up and you think, ooh that was very real and then when you think about it
  

you think, ooh that was most 
   
odd!
Couldn't possibly of been real!
    

I think the night was full of dreams for all sorts of people .
But mummy    that  I sort of thought Adele would act  .
But really you were in bed.
Yeah.
Mm mm.
But sometimes when you're not very well and you get very very hot you get funny dreams, I think you had a very funny dream in the middle of last night didn't you?
Do you remember?
You were very frightened, we had to get you up  read you a story  have a cuddle  put the light on.
I couldn't remember when, I don't think.
It was something like half past two in the morning!
Anyway it didn't matter cos you were very good, and you went back to sleep again in the end  then you didn't wake up till after daddy had gone to work this morning!
No  because then, I just looked  over all those things that  I went  and  .
Oh right.
And then, I knocked at the  very  weak  leg.
Aha.
And when I looked at the clock, I was on time  and .
Didn't matter, we were glad you had a good long sleep, cos it makes you 
Mummy !
feel better when you sleep .
Now what is Timothy doing

I mean, he said his ear hurt, and ha , course that's 
Oh!

Yeah, Christopher said everything was hurting basically 
Yeah.
so we just dosed him up on Calpol 
Yeah.

Sorry, we're just standing here talking !
Oh!
Now, do you think we can make it to the post box  let's go and have a try shall we?
Mhm.
I thought we'd do it in the fresh air rather than in the car, cos it just means
What is that?
Oh yes, attached to it, and you've just had yourself taped by the way.
Have we?
What for ?
A little man turned up Friday afternoon, after they got home  you know how we're very susceptible to these market research  types?
Oh yes.
And erm  it's all to do with language in the nineteen nineties  to go to be  transcribed for posterity and used  to see the change and development of languages 
Oh I see.
and the dictionary people   so I have to tape myself conversing with people 
 
for a week .
Which is all very entertaining!
Yes.
And sometimes I, sort of 
!
things like that, but I'm sure they'll sort it out.
I presume that's why it's for a week, you know?
Yeah.
Out of twenty tapes surely they'll be one that
wouldn't   will  !
Oh dear!
We'll make our way down to the post box first, and then we'll come back and  get bits and pieces on the way Christopher.
Goes through phases of being quite  quite boisterous

James's mum said to me, and she doesn't know her from Adam, she said

Or is he not going to school this morning?
Oh  I'm afraid he's, no he's had chicken pox!

Look, that's easy it's six.
Right.
Because I 
It's back on the shelf there I think.
It's
Back on the shelf?
Mm.
Where?
On my bookshelf, just there.
Where?
There?
Shall I get it for you?
While mast 
Where?

Over here.
Where?
Where are we?
Number one.
Here.
Oh.
Is that that the first book?
Yes.
That I read?
Yes.
That's number one book.
That's right.
That's number one book.
How are we doing?
You just dropped a pencil.
What?
Have you just dropped your pencil?
Mummy.
I shouldn't just leave it on the floor look cos we shan't find it again and then when the hoover tries to pick it up it will  have a fit.
Who  who's gonna  who 
hoover up a pencil do we?
No we don't need to hoover a pencil up.
No we don't.
Don't know where the  is yet do we?
Perhaps it's hiding somewhere so it doesn't get hoovered up.
Mm.
Could be.
What about behind there?
That  behind there it wouldn't get hoovered up.
True.
I bet there's a lot of things behind there.
Such as 
Anyway there's glue behind there.
Scissors behind there.
No.
We had to get most of them out.
The glue's out.
What?
I tried to get most of them out.
Oh.
There's no glue.
Good.
There's not supposed to be.
I do try and get most of the things out from behind there it's this this bookcase I have terrible trouble with.
 
Come on.
Let's be getting going.
Are we having this story?
Are you ready?
Timmy the catcher mouse was a little black cat.
Timmy the catcher mouse was a very long name for a very little cat so everyone called him  Tim.
Tim.
Tim lived in a hole under the steps of a very old house.
He lived there with his mother  and his sister Tessa .
Tessa.
That doesn't say Tessa.
That one says 
Tim.
Tim.
That's right.
His mother's name was Peggity but everyone called her Pegs  .
Pegs.
And what does this bit say?
Pegs.
That's right.
One day Pegs was going out.
You can play in the garden while I'm away she said.
But remember this.
A magician lives in the house  everyone says that he's very grumpy so if you meet the magician you must be very polite.
I'll remember said Tim .
Tim  er
Mum, that's  
Tim and 
Pegs.
That's right.
Pegs went out.
She ran across the garden to the old iron gate.
She crept under the gate and out into the lane .
Pegs.
Er Pegs said
No, it says Pegs went out.
Pegs went out.
That's right.
Again.
Pegs went out.
That's right.
There's the word went look, and there's the word out.
Pegs went out.
Pegs went out.
That's right.
Went  out.
Where's the Pegs went out?
Well you can see it there.
There's Pegs.
There's went.
Went 
This is seven isn't it mum?
And that's out.
out.
Mum that's seven.
It is, yes.
Pegs went out.
Mhm.
Mum, to do a seven you have to go across and then down.
You do, you're right.
Mummy.
And then up.
Tim looked at his sister.
She was fast asleep.
I used to do it that way 
Tim jumped on her to wake her up but she only said go away, and went back to sleep again .
What does this bit say?
Do you remember?
Tim  er
Jumped.
Tim jumped.
That one bit says Tim and that bit there says jumped.
Tim jumped.
That's five isn't it?
Yes.
Whoops, we've missed, I lost our page there .
Tim got out of the hole.
The sun was shining and the sky was blue.
Tim went out into the garden .
Hold on.
You've got to say this bit first.
Tim went out.
Very good.
That was a bit clever.
Is that all done?
Are they all done now?
Tim saw a tree  well  er they look all done to me.
Tim saw a tree.
That's right.
The tree was growing near the house .
He's gonna go up there in the  the house.
Do you want to try that one?
It's a bit like what we've been doing before where you've got to look at the money.
It said  how much for both?
Tick the money you will need .
You have to tick off.
It's going to be nine p and one p.
That makes ten p altogether and you have to tick off the ten pence  by doing a five and a five.
So you have to add this bit up first.
Mummy.
Three p and five p and write down what it comes to.
What will that be?
So you have to tick that one off?
   
Wait a minute.
Well find that first of all.
Three p and five p makes?
Read it.
Jus can I just show Christopher what to do with this page?
Cos once he's got going he can get on with it himself then.
Eight.
That's right.
So put your eight p down there.
And then you have to work out the coins that you'll need for eight p 
Mummy.
or three p and five p.
Mummy.
Mummy.
So which ones will you need?
Just tick them off, the bits that you'll need.
Tim went  ran up the tree.
Erm 
Nearly.
Tim ran to the tree.
Ran to to the tree.
Will I need two and two and one?
Will you need what love?
Two two and one.
Two two and one.
That would make five.
And then you need another three.
Why don't you have the fi look for the three p first  and tick that off and then look for the five p next and tick that off.
Tick five p off?
Tick five p off.
I don't know this bit.
Mm.
Cos you know that five p and three p are gonna make eight p don't you?
Mummy  mum.
Does that say 
Five p 
Just hold on Tim while I just sort him out.
Cos if 
That's right.
That's five p and now you need
You can't really see it  
No you can't really.
That's better.
You still can't see it.
Well make a big tick sticking out like there's does.
That's it, now    That's it there, now what else makes eight p?
Mummy.
Tim climbed to the very top of the tree.
He looked down and saw the house.
The roof of the house was very close to the top of the tree .
Three.
Tim
You haven't got a three p.
Looked 
looked 
Well!
We have to do this.
Tick that one.
Down .
down.
That's it.
Tim looked down.
And tick that one.
You've got four p there.
Do you know what you're doing on that  that that's for that one.
You're up here.
Mm.
Mummy Tim  ran 
You've ticked the wrong things but it doesn't matter cos we can probably use those anyway.
 
Tim 
climbed  Tim climbed up there.
It's a good try.
It actually says  Tim saw the window.
Tim jumped on to the roof of the house.
There was a window in the roof.
Tim saw the window.
The window was open .
Tim 
Saw
saw 
Three  three p.
the 
the
window.
Three p mum.
Three p.
That's it.
That's it.
Well done.
Now you have to do this one.
Tricky aren't they, these?
Tim ran up the roof to the window.
He looked down into the room below.
He saw an old man sitting in a chair.
The old man had long white hair and a white beard.
He must be a magician 
Mum nine.
Tim said to himself .
Magician.
That's it.
The magician.
Well done.
Nine there.
Mhm.
He's going in.
The magician was fast asleep.
Tim leaned over to have a good look at him, but his foot slipped and he fell in.
He landed right on the magician's knee.
Tim dug in his claws and held on .
Tim  fell in.
Well done.
The magician woke up with a yell of pain.
He saw Tim standing on his knee.
Where on earth did you come from?
He asked.
I fell in said Tim.
Then you'd better fall out again said the magician.
Take your claws out of my knee and go away .
Tim
The
the  magician
woke
up.
That's it.
five  
Tim pulled out his claws.
He looked up at the 
Four.
window.
I can't get up there by myself he said .
Tim 
Looked
Look mummy.
looked
Look.
up 
at up.
That's it.
It is it.
You're right.
We'll soon see about that said the magician.
One two three and you're back 
Six p in there.
in the tree.
And he snapped his fingers .
Isn't it six?
This one says one  two  three.
Two  three.
That's it.
Tick.
That's it.
Very good.
Tim felt himself flying up in the air.
A moment later he found himself back in the top of the tree .
Nine.
And
Nine is here.
Yeah.
And 
Tim
was  in the
tree.
Very good.
You're good at this book aren't you Tim?
Tim climbed down the tree just as Pegs came back into the garden.
Tim ran to ni to meet her.
Tim cried Pegs.
Where have you been ?
Tim
Ran.
ran  home.
Well it should say Tim ran home.
It doesn't, it just says Tim ran.
It would make more sense if it said Tim ran home.
Tim been to the magician.
He has.
I've been to see the magician said Tim.
It was very exciting.
I expect it was said Pegs but you better be careful Tim.
Magicians can work magic.
I know they can said Tim.
The magician did work magic.
I flew up into the tree.
It was very exciting but I shall be very careful next time .
Tim  and Pegs.
That's it.
Tim on the pegs.
Tim and Pegs.
It's cos they're both on the picture.
And that's the end of the book.
You were very good at that weren't you?
Oh.
Another nine.
Oh good gracious.
Two nines.
Oh that's 
Look.
easy then.
You'll be able to use the same coins.
 

Two  five.
That's only seven.
Mum.

Mummy.
Two and five is only seven.
You need another two.
That's it.
Mum.
Mm.

You don't have to.
If you want to you can give up now and we'll do some reading next.
Do you want to have a go at My Mum's a Window Cleaner?
And then after that we'll go in the garden.
What?
I said after that we'll go in the garden before it rains.
We'll also have to ring grandma and tell her that we won't be coming to her house today cos we won't be going swimming.
Cos although you're much better now
Mum I want to read this.
I don't think you should be going to erm   I don't think we'll read another one just right this minute lovey.
Cos I'm going to read with Christopher 
It's a different one.
now.
It's Christopher's turn to read.
I feel really better.
You feel really better?
Well that's nice?
He going swimming?
He's not going swimming, no.
Would you like to go and get a card out of there look, and do some drawing?
Mum, will we play school instead?

Some people say it's unlucky to walk under ladders.
I think it's a lot of rubbish.
Unlucky?
Mm.
What does that mean?
Well there you are.
That's why it would be unlucky, cos she'll drop water all over you.
Do you think it's unlucky?
No I don't.
I think it's silly to say that.
Because  if it's silly 
It's just a bit of a joke really.
But some people think it's serious.
You have to be careful when you walk under a ladder  or 
Or you might get a

Here love, that's yours.
It nearly fell over.
Okay chatterboxes, let's have it.
How was your day then love?
Okay 
Oh.
Yes.
impressive.
That's you Tim.
And we'll chop your meat up before we go much further.
There's you.
Yum yum yum.
Nice sprouts.
daffodils out since  this morning.
And what else have do you notice dear?
Oh, a clean tidy garden.
Well half a clean tidy garden .
Can you see the grass is cut?
You've been cutting the bottom part of the grass?
We have.
And we've put a bit of seed on that bit so it's .
And we had the lawnmower.
You had the lawnmower out did you?
Can you put your bib on?
Can you see some seed where there's no grass?
Seems like an appropriate thing to do when one's stuck at home.
Tim  sit.
We get lots of birds in our  garden don't we?
Properly please.
can see lots of birds.
 
four huge pigeons sitting in the on the grass earlier on.
see pigeons 
And the cats.
There used to be two but there's four now.
Do you think they've
And the cats.
And you saw a cat as well did you?
And he run away.
Did it?
Because he doesn't like me.
Oh.
Right, who's going to say thank you? 
Amen
I bang the drum.
You did bang the drum.
Anybody want any of this?
No thank you.
I want some  I just  No I 
I'll do it.
I wanted to  get it out.
No Tim.
Tim.
I wanted to get it out.
Tim  otherwise it'll go everywhere you see.
You can shake it with me.
I wanted to get it out.
Alright you don't  have any then in that case.
I want it.
I want
Well if you stop crying and ask for it properly and you don't mind if mummy or daddy do it for you that's fine.
I want it  do it myself.
No.
Yeah.
I want to do it myself 
Do you want me to do it or not?
No.
Right.
I want to get it out 
You just want to pick it out?
Yeah .
You're not going to shake it over your dinner?
Thank you.
That bit.
No I want that too.
Right, here you are.
Mum
That's that one done.
out.
Thank you.
Right.
The lid.
Good gracious me.
What a carry on.
Welcome home dear.
Has it been alright today?
It's been comparatively peaceful today.
Good.
When did everybody get up?
Mum could you cut my meat?
They all sort of surfaced 
You were all asleep when I er
I think I'd  had I finished my breakfast when, no  I think you just came just as I was about to take my first mouthful of cereal.
It was about quarter to eight before everybody, well  after that 
No but it wasn't.
What time did you get up?
What time did you go?
I left at twenty to eight.
Mm.
It was about  ten to eight  when Christopher got up.
But Tim was still asleep  till about quarter past eight .
Oh.
And I shouted for daddy.
Did you?
Which is unheard of.
Yes you did shout for daddy.
You shouted for daddy?
I was already at work.
There was no daddy.
He'd gone to work already.
So then we had a bit of a wonder whether or not Christopher should go to school.
And I decided he was, should stay at home.
It's probably just as well cos
Mm.
pool his strength for tomorrow.
He was a bit sort of wobbly on his legs at the beginning of the day but he's been 
Yeah.
fine since.
And Tim's going to 
Nursery.
Holly Cottage tomorrow.
Aren't you?
Ow.
Where   Look I found a yellow .
 

We did go down to the library.
Cos I thought it would, it was such a warm day I thought it would be quite nice for him to have a walk  see if he  was alright.
Anyway managed to walk to the library and walk down the shops .
But when we got back we had to lie down in front of the video for a bit.
Mum 
Mum, can I  for a minute please.
Mhm.
So you just did your own private trip to the library ?
Yeah I rang up and said I wasn't gonna go   the children.
Anyway it turned out we met Ann and  erm both Martin and Ian are  been having a similar trauma.
Have they?
Mm.
Oh.
Ian's been sort of talking about all sorts of strange things in his sleep and
Really?
delirious and hot  hot
Yes.
fever.
So
It's odd.
A bug they're passing around.
Mm.
Must be.
Child to child.
And she said Martin was hot but nothing too traumatic.
A bit like these two really.
Mm.
But Ian had been sick as well.
So it's likely they picked it up from them.
I should think so.
Although Christopher didn't really see much of them did he?
Oh he did on Thursday didn't he?
Mm.
I would have thought Tim would have had it worse from  contact erm wise.
These things don't work like that do they?
No.
And is the parentage alright?
Mm.
Only strikes children.
Yeah.
Well it certainly did  in both these cases.
Although I met Theresa on the way back from erm  school and she said Alec was at the doctors cos  not the way back from school, way back from the library.
And she said Alec was at the doctors cos he was feeling  under the weather.
Yeah.
So I don't know what that's in aid of.
Julia  ill so she 
Was she?
won't be at work tomorrow.
Oh dear.
What's the matter with her?
 
I don't want the meat.
What's the matter with her?
Sore throat.
I don't want the meat.
You don't want the meat?
No.
You usually like meat.
It probably needs chopping up.
Mm.
Let's chop it for you.
No I don't want it chopped.
Tim listen.
I'm going to chop you 
I don't want 
I'm going to chop you one piece of meat okay?
We'll take away the other piece.
A big pieces.
Yeah.
There you go.
It'll be nice now.
Nice and tasty.
Well done Christopher.
Mm.
You alright?
Must be getting better.
So, it's been a nice warm day has it?
Well it has really.
It's been a bit sort of muggy this afternoon but we went out in the garden and we sort of just  pottled around you know?
Better than the weekend weather that I saw?
Yeah.
It's amazing how the worst weather we've had recently has been on  Saturdays and Sundays isn't it?
Mm.
It's certainly very wet out there.
We had a go on the swing.
Did you?
You've been on the swing?
Apart from her sore throat was Julie okay?
Seemed alright.
I  wobbly.
Mm?
Yeah.
No it was a fairly quiet day really.
Not many people seemed to be at work.
Oh.
Where are they all?
Some at meetings .
Like you know all 
Yeah 
the people who went to  Pontepool last week?
Well they're all off in  Bromsgrove this week .
Potato.
Mm.
and big Patrick and Sue  
Oh yeah, in Bromsgrove yeah.
Mm.
What do they do?
Mm.
 

You gave me lots.
I did not.
You did.
I certainly didn't give you lots of meat.
I'm full.
Oh that's alright.
You don't need to have anything else.
I want my pudding.
Oh no.
If you're full you won't need pudding.
No it'll be a tiny pudding if you're  not gonna eat er finish all that.
It's too much.
Well that's okay.
You can leave it but you just don't get pudding as well.
You eat just a little bit more.
Cos then you can have a little pudding.
That's it, you eat just a little bit more.
That's very tasty mummy.
Certainly looks as though it's a  Rosemary Conley type thing.
eat it.
You help me  meat.
Whoops, it's in your eye.
Oh.
Oh.
Potato.
Potato in your eye.
Getting potatoes in your eyes.
That's a funny place to put potato.
Mm broccoli doesn't want to come on the fork.
Come here broccoli.
Broccoli can't get on fork very well can it?
We rang grandma of course to say we wouldn't be swimming.
So she's at home alright is she?
There's a lot of things we're not doing isn't there at the moment?
Mm.
Yes.
She's fine.
And there are a lot of things we are doing.
 

What else have ?
Oh that's it really.
Library this morning and garden this afternoon .
And zom zombieness in between.
I can imagine actually.
No it must have been nice.
The  is more  and  
Mummy was there  it didn't feel like a long day did it ?
No.
Feeled like just this morning didn't it?
It all passed along didn't it?
It feeled like just this morning.
Mm.
Didn't it?
Mm.
Because usually this morning we usually have video and it feeled like this morning all the time.
Doesn't it mum?
We didn't watch much video this morning at all really 
Dad.
until lunchtime.
Mm?
When we watched telly
Yes.
we saw a boat, the big boat.
About a big boat.
What's the big boat?
He tells me 
You know you you told me about the big boat didn't you?
Oh about the Queen Mary?
 
Oh, right.
I think that was a different boat to the one that they showed you on the telly.
I was telling you about the Queen Mary.
Because it was on the back of  something which he was making recently.
You know he was cutting out some card 
Mm.
He showed me what it was.
But I couldn't tell that it was the Queen Mary at the time because he'd already cut it out.
and I was saying that it's a big boat that used to go across the world.
And when I was a little boy just a little bit bigger than  Christopher  I was shown round it with granny and grandpa  and Uncle Michael and Uncle David.
Mm.
That's  the same isn't it?
We went to Southampton to the docks.
I want some pudding now.
I read about it in the paper today 
Well done Tim.
and it's owned by Walt Disney .
I want some pudding.
And they're losing so much money they're selling it.
The thing is nobody wants to buy it 
Some pudding now.
so they're  scrap .
What was Walt Disney doing with it may we ask?
Well
Was it a  restaurant or something?
it was a floating restaurant   loses money on it.
I want pudding  
Why?
It was just too expensive to maintain.
Oh.
I want some pudding now.
I want some pudding.
Somewhere in the 
Yes we know that Tim but you're just going to have to wait until we've all finished.
 
Daddy left sprouts.
I can't manage any more I'm afraid mummy.
Daddy left sprouts.
Ooh daddy!
I might have  
Right.
I'm afraid I've had no exercise cos I haven't walked to the shops.
Well I suppose .
You'll have to put the exercise video on dear and
Are you gonna have some pudding?
 
But we've got the Rosie and Jim.
Mm.
Oh we've got Rosie and Jim have we?
 
A new Rosie and Jim.
It's about a horse and John gets a new one.
Because a pony goes faster than a big horse.
Does it?
Mm.
And they're in  
And you have to watch it.
They go to a shire horse centre near Stratford on Avon.
Do you know where that is?
Yeah and a shire horse doesn't go very fast.
I didn't know there was one .
the shire horse goes slowly.
May I have my pudding please?
Yes.
Let's just cut the pa 
And the pony went really fast  
I  
And guess who was in the pony 
Rosie and Jim.
Yes.
 
And guess who was in the  on the big horse and just went slow?
 

The big one
Thank you.
the big one went so slow.
They were in the front
Mm.
but Rosie said  come on fast.
And the pony went fast and it overtakes
Does it?
it on the way home.
Okay.
I'll just go round the other side and get the ice-cream.
 

We keep doing this.
I'm having a lot.
Are you?
Cos I finished all my dinner 
You did finish all your dinner in the end didn't you after moaning on.
Did he?
Yes, didn't you notice?
He finished the lot.
Typical.
Mum.
I'm gonna serve it out.
All of it.
That's mine.
Right.
That's  that's daddy's.
Who's is  Daddy's.
I'll just get 
Do you want to take that to daddy?
Daddy  yours.
ice-cream
Thank you.
it is.
It's a chocolate 
That's Christopher's.
Yours Christopher.
And that's  that's you.
And  mummy.
A pear and a  Mummy 
 

Mummy  all that.
Why do you always have pears mummy?
Cos I just fancy them at the moment.
I sort of 
I love pears.
Do you?
And me.
Oh  have some too if you want.
It's nice to see a happy family.
It's certainly much improved on yesterday I tell you.
A very jolly day really.
A trial weekend wasn't it?
It was a bit of a trial weekend .
In many respects.
 
Mum, when are you going to have actually porridge  again?
I had actually porridge on Saturday.
And would you like to have it again?
Mm.
Not next Saturday.
Why can't I have it on Saturday?
But last Saturday you didn't.
No the 
I did.
Saturday before that  you didn't did you?
Neither did you.
Yes the previous Saturday  you didn't want it.
Oh didn't I?
The rest of us had it.
Beg pardon.
I'd forgotten that one.
The Saturday before that  none of us had it cos we were at granny and grandpa's.
Oh that was what I was remembering.
And the Saturday before that none of us had it cos you were gallivanting up and down the country with the
Correct.
the railways.
So you haven't seen grandma presumably just sort of spoke to her?
No we just rang her up.
Very briefly.
Have you been out anywhere  car.
We've never had the car out all day.
 
What?
I thought it was more sensible to walk to the library rather than go in the car cos
Yeah.
I thought it was good for us.
I'm sure it was.
Mm.
All go in the car.
I like it better walking.
Mm.
So do I.
It's nice to walk.
mummy.
So you don't 
I think it says somewhere in the  in the writing you've got to have done at least two days.
Who gave you that?
Who gave me what?
That?
What?
That?
The cassette.
A man.
Mum's got to give it back to the man.
When?
It's only it's only on loan.
Why?
Because it belongs to the man.
Why will you give it 
Oh that will make a nice birthday present.
A little Walkman.
Very anti-social.
I'm against anti-social things I'm afraid.
Mum when you have to give it back to the man?
Mum you should have had it after your birthday.
I'll only suggest Walkmans 
Mum when you have to 
when the music gets so loud here that you can't stand  
 
back to the man?
Friday.
Why?
Why?
Because it's his anyway.
He's only just lent it to me to  to use during this week.
Oh I don't suppose it's his but 
Well  so in last week and this week?
Just this week.
Well Friday to Friday.
One week.
So they'll be able to record the excitement that might happen tomorrow.
I wonder what's gonna happen tomorrow.
Mm it's been very thrilling so far hasn't it?
Everybody being sick .
A week in the life of.
In the  .
A jolly little incident in Kwiksave that you would have been amused at dear.
Mhm.
We wanted to get some Rice Crispies okay?
And we thought  a good place to get Rice Crispies at Kwiksave
cos they're cheaper than Tesco's.
They were  we found the Rice Crispies 
 
place didn't we?
And there was just one sort of half opened, half scattered packet sitting there.
So we looked around and there was erm  a box full of them right up high, yeah?
So we thought oh well, go and get an assistant.
Yeah.
So it caused chaos
Did it?
you know trying to find an assistant cos there wasn't one walking about cos there was some at the  tills but there weren't any walking around and it was very busy, there were lots of people going through the tills.
So anyway this girl eventually she said she was, it was her coffee break but she would come er in passing and sort us out.
But mummy  mummy.
So she came down, it was so embarrassing .
Mummy.
I explained about the Rice Crispies she said ah 
Mummy.
I think there must be some in here.
There was another great big box but instead of being up high it was down below and I could easily 
Mummy.
have helped myself  to it .
Mummy
Yeah  seen it?
Mummy.
Well they must have been just well they must have I didn't see them 
Mummy.
They must have been unpacking Rice Crispies.
Mummy
They were a bit away from the Rice Crispie hole type of thing but  if I'd have used my eyes I would have noticed where they were.
Mummy  mummy.
Yes Timothy.
You don't know what to say now you've you've shouted at me.
Yes Tim, what were you gonna say.
That's what I'm thinking.
Come on.
Let's hear it.
Something about Rice Crispies?
Something about going to the shops?
Or something about going to the library?
Who do you take to the library with you?
No.
Oh, didn't Christopher go to the library?
Well he did but  we didn't sort of take Christopher.
He just came.
Oh.
Somebody else came did they?
Did you?
Who did you take to the library with you?
In your hand, who did you have?
We took  
 
You took teddy didn't you?
Did you take a teddy?
Did you?
He chose  
We hadn't actually heard anything about this library experience but when I asked him he wouldn't say anything.
don't know what 
We don't quite know what happened.
to teddies.
What did you do with them when you got in there?
What was it called?
You had a biscuit?
Mm.
We saw the biscuit 
A picnic.
a picnic!
You had a picnic?
A picnic for teddies?
Well well.
A pretend picnic?
Mm.
He came out with a a a biscuit covered in desiccated coconut.
Which he didn't like to eat so  Cider ate it in the end.
Cider the dog .
 
You can guess what happened  he gave it to me.
Yes.
Mummy dropped it when she was giving it to me.
 
And then we had to pick it up and put it near Cider and Cider ate it.
Cider likes coconut.
However we still don't know what happened.
Did you have some stories with this teddy?
Yeah.
Mm.
Mum
Stories about teddies?
I don't like feeling hot.
A teddy went in the dump.
A teddy went in the dump?
Oh dear.
Did they get him out again?
Mm.
Because a 
Oh.
He kick them home.
Kick them home.
No
He went in a van?
Mum  What about story  was a bit like that.
Mm.
Yeah because they lost a teddy in the dump.
And they went home in the lorry.
Mm.
Didn't they?
Mm could have been that one.
Did you have any more stories about teddies?
Mm.
What else did you have?
Teddy 
What about what about  
 
owl.
Teddy what?
With a owl.
A teddy with an owl?
And what happened with a teddy and an owl?
He falled.
He fell?
Falled?
The teddy.
The teddy fell down?
Did the owl catch him?
and you don't usually
No.
Oh.
you don't usually say falled do you?
And boy kept back.
And the boy came back.
What was the boy called?
I don't know.
It wasn't Christopher Robin was it?
No.
It might have been.
Trying my best .
Next time it won't be Monday when we go.
Won't it?
No, it will be Friday.
Wrong again.
Thursday.
Only we can't take him on Thursday cos we're busy on Thursday.
Yeah.
So we shall have to miss a week, and go the week after.
Is the week after a Monday?
Mm.
I presume so.
Why is not on a ?
Well they didn't tell us why.
Just said it wasn't.
I think they're just a bit shortstaffed because  the girl that's usually in there hasn't been in there for weeks, Josie.
They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday  during the week.
Perhaps she's ill.
What did you say?
What did you say mother?
I said there's normally a different lady in the  in the library.
For what?
On a Monday.
The lady that was in there today  not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there  well, when she's there.
The other lady, Josie, she's normally  in there.
But she hasn't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill.
Or on holiday or something.
No she can't be on holiday all that length of time.
She's back now.
No she wasn't today.
There was a lady there but that's the lady that normally goes on a Saturday.
But why didn't she go on a Saturday then?
Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well.
They probably had to rake her in to  hold the fort.
I expect she didn't go .
I don't know.
Why?
I don't know whether she did or not.
I've got a 
We've got a train.
Actually mummy
Mm.
We've got a train.
Playbus said about a horse which goes slowly.
Oh.
They're all about animals really that do things.
think about.
You'll enjoy that, it's all about eggs.
Is it?
animals.
Yes but you can't see that till after Rosie and Jim now.
Should you ever want to watch it all.
I don't think I've got time to watch all these things.
It's too exciting isn't it?
It's all very gripping.
Well there won't be any time tomorrow to watch anything.
There's three things.
Well there's four things.
I've arranged with my
Oh definitely tonight.
I've arranged with my mother to er take her home after tea.
There's a new there's a new thing on 
So all is well for Inspector Morse.
instead of Bump.
She was quite happy to.
She said  she wanted to really.
And she said 
Mum, there's something 
she'd got to  do Wednesday night.
And I've just realized I'm supposed to do Wednesday night as well.
I'd forgotten.
Mum.
So I'll have to prepare it tomorrow morning.
Mummy.
Or tonight, I could do.
There's something new  er instead of that Bump.
It's it's called 
It wasn't Bump today you mean?
No it's a new one.
It's not been Bump for a week or two.
Oh so it's something new now?
Yeah.
Not Bump.
Was it Poddington Peas?
Oh it was something about peas.
I don't know what it was.
Yeah.
Poddington Peas.

Yes.
And there was one place which was called creepy.
Oh right.
Creepea 
There was a .
Oh.
And a man looked for the .
Yeah and the 
It sounds very gripping.
Well that
Well the person  
I don't know  
and the drum went on the floor.
Oh dear.
Why don't we start right at the beginning of the  tape?
Because we're not bothering watching any more now.
That's it  
I'm gonna wash up now.
And then  oh it will be reading stories won't it?
I think so.
It'll be bed time.
Right.
Okay.
It's quarter past six already.
But you were going to play tummyache.
I expect you can play tummyache while I do 
True.

Yeah.
Unless you want to play tummyache?
And you wash the 
I'm prepared to wash up.
And you wash the
I, it it's my turn to wash up isn't it?
Cos mummy made the tea
Yeah.
so daddy does the washing up.
Except it looks as though I won't be washing up something here.
Sometimes we have  do the washing up.
Why  why is he not eating it up?
It's pie.
He doesn't like pie does he?
He's always eaten it before.
Has he?
Are you gonna finish it?
So is it okay if I eat it all?
Mum, we were going to watch Rosie and Jim 
Oh Tim, no.
weren't we?
Well we were, but only with daddy.
We can always do it another day.
Cos you know, as long as it's on there.
Yeah.
Cos last week I didn't see Rosie and Jim until  nearly the end of the week.
He doesn't mind do you daddy?
No I don't mind as long as it's not wiped off.
Not seeing it right at the minute.
Well it won't be wiped off dear.
Never wipe Rosie and Jim off for a long time.
Tim!
Yes you have, you wiped the jelly one off when it was  very new.
True.
Sorry about that.
A slip of the finger.
Naughty mummy.
Sorry.
Cos daddy hasn't watched that.
I did watch the jelly one.
Yes he did 
Yes.

Wibbly wobbly.
Before you  
You haven't.

It was all about moulds.
Yes.
And the mould for the windlass.
Oh.
Think all of us  and watched it and you and mum and me.
Well there you are then.
We haven't missed anything.
Yes.
That's right.
There are a few that I haven't seen on  isn't there?
Because one week we had one from a long bit ago but I didn't see the rest through the week.
Oh.
Did I once?
So I missed a few Playbuses.
Mm.
I don't think you do re miss it really.
You see them in the end.
I see them  one day.
You haven't  seen one cos you haven't seen the racing.
Do other people have so much trouble with their videos ?
I wonder if other people have so much trouble videoing videos as we do?
The racing cars.
Yeah racing cars is today.
Why  
Yeah.
trouble videoing.
Well it's not so much trouble but kind of you know 
Mummy.
excitement about it all.
It is a racing car on Playbus.

They were racing along and then  
Do you think it'll wear off?
You know as the newness of the video wears off.
The racing lorry 
Mummy  mummy  the racing lorry on Playbus.

I sat down with my coffee.
Did you?
As I, well I got given orders.
Come and watch this mummy.
So I thought I would.
You haven't watched the racing cars.
I haven't watched it.
No I haven't seen it.
You watched none of them.
I've not watched any videos or television all day because I've been hard at work.
What might be more interesting is if re Christopher reads you his reading book from the library cos it's really good fun.
You'll enjoy the story.
Cos it was a surprise to us wasn't it?
Yeah, it's not really about my mum.
It's not about your mum the the window cleaner?
No, it's about  
Don't tell him don't tell him don't tell him cos it's more exciting
Yes.
if he doesn't know.
Go and get it now cos he'll enjoy it.
I'll do the washing up.
Cos it's, oh you can listen to this now, it's only about
Oh.
ten seconds.
Is it?
Right.
It's not long, that story.
Isn't it?
And then we can play tummyache without any  interruption.
You haven't watched all of the
No.
You watched the puppet show one.
I've seen the puppet show one, yes.

Have you got yours in?
Is your seatbelt on?
No.
You'd best put it on quickly.
Mum 
Well in the garage it's a little bit different because  there's only the garage to hit isn't there?
So if you hit the garage you're going very very slowly and you might just give yourself a jolt but you wouldn't hurt yourself quite so much.

Hopefully.
Cos with sand you don't get soaking 
No.
We put water in our sand.

No we're alright.
We don't need petrol right this minute.

Just before you tell me about  yesterday.

You know when you go to  erm  collect Christopher from school?
Mhm.
Instead of walking back down to our house
go down towards the pub.
At the end of that place where you park?
No.
No no no.
Go down the path to the pub.
You know at the bottom?
The Jolly Farmer?
Oh.
And wait in the car park down there.
Oh.
Round that  
Cos that'll save me five minutes.
I can't remember which way I go.
Do I turn left?
Well, you know when you get up the top  you come out the school gates
Turn right.
and you turn right.
Mm.
And then instead of turning left down towards where we park the car,
Mm.
keep going.
Straight on.
Yeah.
There's a path goes down a slope.
Yeah.
You follow your nose down to the bottom of there.
Then you turn,
 
well you just follow the path.
It turns right  and into the car park.
Oh so we follow the path and don't go over that bridge over the road?
No.
Don't go towards that, just keep on the path  towards the Jolly Farmer?
I've been round there but 
Yeah?
I've forgotten it .
Well you'll see at the bottom of that hill that th there's the Jolly Farmer sitting in front of your eyes.
Mm.
We're going in there then are we?
Well I should think so.
I don't think the Jolly Farmer does meals.
No.
But I thought if you do that then I can turn in that car park
Mm.
at the Jolly Farmer.
And er
Pick us up and
pick you up and then we can sail off to  lunch.
That's right.
And it'll just save us a few minutes because it'll be  tight squeeze I expect.
It will if we're not quick because erm
Yeah.
we don't want to rush them eating it do we?
Oh no.
It's meant to be a party night.
Well  laugh 
Right.
Two girls 
It was 
on a train.
on Monday morning
Mm.
setting off.
I set off and we had a taxi because it was terrible and I thought oh well, we had a lovely weekend, I'm not going to er spoil it by being soaking wet getting to Piccadilly station.
So I said we'll order a taxi, so we order a taxi.
Well  er he came, the taxi man you see and  Irene  I don't know what, what was up with her because she gets my little bag  into the taxi  leaves all the doors wide open.
Ooh dear .
And I'm jigging out with another bag and the taxi man says er no, are there any more people?
I said no, I said.
Ooh I said she's not lo I said eh, what about the doors?
Dear .
Oh.
So we, and the taxi man 
She perhaps thought she was going home.
I don't know what she thought.
So er  the taxi man said 
Going away.
give me the keys and I'll lock the door.
I said alright.
So  we we pair of us supervised locking the door.
The 
Dear.
taxi man and me.
. Found out he knew all this area
Oh.
and had a right chat with him on the way but, laugh.
So last night  oh she said  that, you know what  did with the door she said, it caused a minor sensation with my two old ne next door neighbours.
They thought she was ill.
Oh I see.
Mm.
And the so the taxi man and I were er
Was taking her away.
was er t don't know what they thought we were d doing.
Yes, with her not locking her own front door.
Oh dear.
Cos we had to get the keys off her.
Well at least it was nice that they were  looking out and 
Well that's it I said well it just shows you that they do watch what y for you don't they?
Mm.
They're a nice couple, next door.
Mm.
He's called Fred.
So apparently last night he came knocking on the door.
To see if she was alright.
So she'd been out all day to this cousin's at  Blakely She goes on a Monday now.
Oh he said, do you go every week?
Oh he said I'll bring you a leaflet.
You could get a dial-a-ride.
Oh.
You're over seventy.
Oh right.
They take you there for twenty P if you reg he said I'll bring you the papers.
Oh that's good.
That's handy isn't it?
So  Yeah I sa er well she'd, actually she does two twenty P's cos she goes to town and gets a few things but, I mean it, I said it might be bad weather one day
Mm.
and you'd be glad to dial it.
Mm.
But you fill in this form
From your front door type of thing?
Yes, they come for you.
Oh.
So erm only in the Manchester area.
Mm.
You know Manchester City Council.
They do a dial-a-ride in Redditch.
They do?
But I've never used it.
But anybody can use it but under  under seventy or something you have to pay  so much.
You know, like go to the hospital with it or something.
Yes you can.
Well anyway  so he got her these forms.
I said well it's worth registering.
I said Annie could do that.
Mm.
She's over seventy.
I said why  they'd come for her wouldn't they?
Mm.
Do they do things on a regular basis?
You know?
I suppose they do.
I said fill it in and see, no harm in  always say no 
Mm can only say no.
can't they?
Mm.
So he, he, as I was talking to her last night on the phone the front door bell's going and it's our Fred from next door  right looking after her and bringing forms for her to fill in to get dial-a-ride.
I thought jolly nice isn't it?
Mm.
Well then th they must have been  she said they'd been concerned all day.

Right.
Then she does a bit of ironing for her.
She don't, she do she i she er finished her eightieth birthday  and then had a stroke.
Oh did she?
When she got over the stroke she fell and broke her hand.
The first time 
Oh I remember you saying that.
first time  that the church warden came for her to go to church she fell getting out of his car.
Oh dear.
Mm.
So then  I had  on the train.
And these two girls, I think everybody was going for interviews at Man er Birmingham university yesterday.

And it was all crowded and so forth.
And we met this gi I don't think these two were going to Birmingham university but they were going somewhere.
Mm.
So erm  these two girls, I couldn't  I mean I was reading but couldn't tell but they could.
And I heard the girl saying well  I don't look for smart shoes now.

I thought well at your age what are you going to do ?
Eh?
So she must have been wearing some funny shoes to get corns on

So then it got into 
It's too late though now.

They improve with age I
Er I I I  he said that oh yes I do want to go down these stairs but  there's folks coming up and down and the esc you know, someone coming on the escalator.
They ought to have escalators going down you know in Birmingham.
They did, yes.
So er  he carried them down for me.
They might have them might they, might they when they've finished all this refurbishing?
I can't see where they're gonna put them.
Oh I see.

Mm.
You've got to go and ask for them to take you on the erm
Lift.
lifts if you're er
Decrepit.

Mm.
But anyway  as usual you get on the station.
All of a sudden as they like to do in Birmingham station, all the trains are coming in on different platforms from usual and  and er delays here and do you know what it was?
It was on the television last night.
It was a huge fire at erm
Oh.

So everything was coming in on different lines?
and it sounded as though it was on the railway but it wasn't the railway it was a big factory at the side.
Mm.
And they er er they said  people getting on this train er it was  on the eleven, platform eleven near to where we were  make sure, they kept giving it out giving it out, you must get out at Leamington Spa if you want Banbury.
Mm.
And they're going to lay some coaches on.
Because this train is going to avoid Banbury.
Mm.
To get to wherever it was going.
Mm.
That's the trouble with Birmingham.
Because it's where it is in the country, any catastrophe up or down
It ups yes oh ah

So er there was this poor girl sitting on this seat and I'd seen her there and so, there was a nice lady sat  they said er  they took the Redditch train off the thing and put  this Shrewsbury on.
This huge, you know, one two five came  ooh we said, don't get on there if you want the university.

He just got  feverish in the night really.
He seemed to be over it much quicker.

We both survived.
Gritted our teeth and made it through the weekend.
Oh dear.
But you wouldn't want to be without them thought would you?

So the wedding, how was that then?
Oh that was lovely.
Ooh it was cold though.
Oh dear 
So I'm taking some
Were they wearing their thermals?
Well we were.
Yeah but the bride I mean.
Oh I don't know what she had on.
Because the dresses were deep, low there and oh those low ones that come .
Well I wouldn't have chosen them for March cos I mean that's  very nice  
It's the in thing though isn't it?
Off the shoulders and
Yes yes and  you see.
And and the underskirt and everything's all in with the dress isn't it?
Well anyway  she's a nice  I like her very much.
He's chosen 
A nice girl  
But he's, he's got this he's got this  now.

So I saw Paul.

First of August he's getting wed.
Oh he, he's turned into a nice boy has Paul.
I'm sure he has.
Yes.
really, and erm  I I've brought the service and things for you.
Erm Mr , you know Douglas  did the prayers.
Oh yeah.
But erm  the church you see was burnt down where he's gone to but it's nearly finished, altering it.
And and in a sense it's been a blessing in disguise.
Yeah.
Because you go in and they've got this new entrance hall.
Yeah.
And  made a gallery round  for the Sunday school.
And then you go into 
They had a fire at Saint Leonards and they've been saying that really it's been a good thing.
Cos they've had to rethink what they want.
What's  where yes.
And they've 
Cos otherwise you're tied by you know 
Yes that's it.
So 
preservation orders or this that and the other.
Yes, yeah but when it gets burnt down you, I mean they can't  
There's no preservation  .
So and er we got there fairly early, cos the taxi well the taxi man got lost, that's another story.
The taxi man got lost in Manchester.
Anyway we got, we got there in time
Oh no wonder he wanted you to set off early.
Eh?
No wonder he wanted you to set off early, he didn't know where he was going.
anyway we had a nice trip up past  and back through Prestwich and all round.
Till we found out that and he said oh I know where I am now.
Just tu 
He didn't charge you for all that?
No, he took some off.
Fortunately.
Oh that was nice.
He said ooh he said it was my fault.
So he took  anyway  er   I'm getting mixed up with me stories I think.
And at this church  we got there early and the  soon as we walked in there the, the church warden says  toilets are there.
Thanks very much we said.
You must have looked the type.
So we we .
You know we said where we'd come from, that sort of.
So they let us look all round, they said .
So we did you see.
Because er  it's marvellous what they've been able to do.
It's not quite finished.
I expect it was packed was it?
It was full .
And er the thing was, we found out afterwards why they'd done it.
The organ pipes are in the middle of the chancel and you couldn't see the east window at the .
No.
Oh well they said that's because they'd not got that section finished
and .
But the old gargoyles off the church were saved and they've stuck them up all over the  on the erm dividing piece between the church and this new  er  section.
They've got a lovely new kitchen .
Very nice.
I bet 
Oh yes they said.
But we've had a very very  well we've still got him  a good  treasurer.
Who knew what to do and instead of 
Yeah.
instead of saying, telling the er insurance people that they'd give them the bills and they could pay them as they came in, he said they'd got a lump sum.
And he's been able to invest it
Mm.
himself.
Mm.
Mm.
And he wanted, he was a man that knew what he was doing.
Knew where to get extra 
Get extra money.
interest.
And he said er  he's paid, he's paid for everything.
Just a little bit more money they wanted then he shoots off home.
I'm sure, you know, with Alan and this new building, he's been very good.
Yeah.
Because he's known the right people.
Yes.
And when things have turned up and they've not been quite right he's known 
Yes.
There's something sort of practical about him.
You know the 
Yeah that's what he, they said he's been marvellous, this treasurer.
They said we wouldn't have got
No.
but they've gotta let him.
You see.
Mm.
But he, he said to the insurance people no I don't want you just to keep on paying the bills.
Yeah.
He said we'll have a lump sum.
And he got the lump sum and they was investing it and just drawing out when he  needed it.
That's it.
Course it was very nice and we got a proper dinner  at this erm  mind you we were absolutely famished by the time we got there.
Didn't get me dinner till gone three .
Yeah.

set off at .
I had  but erm  we set off from Irene's at half past ten you see.
Oh .
It took him three quarters of an hour to get us there.
So anyway we'd had a good look round and this ch church warden said hey  you'd better go and get some seats cos it's going to get .
Now you've come early he said, have a sit there he said and you'll see everything.
Yeah.
Cos they only booked seats for the immediate family.
So we sat on this row and it was  Paul and his young lady and David  all in the row with us.
And er
Yeah.
It was very nice.
All there they were.
I've had a right good chat to David.
So he, they came to erm  Saint, Saint Kevins on Sunday morning.
And I reckon  Sunday I'd have got a lift home.
Oh right.
had a real good chat with them all Sunday night.
Yeah.
Just pleased you'd got that extra space.
You're not worrying about rushing off.
Well I would have been rushing off.
Anyway it wouldn't have been fair to Irene really  cos we went  Sunday afternoon.
Well you've got nothing to rush off t for have you really?
No.
To look at the er  .
Yeah.
Have they found out any more about  how it started?
Absolute shell.
I don't know, they've, no well they're investigating aren't they?
It's a shame.
you know, you know what it looked like.
But he had made a mess of it.
Are you taking me to the er
I'm taking you to the Jolly Farmers.
Oh, are you?
Which will give you just about the right amount of time then to walk up.
You'll have a nice walk ready for your lunch.

She said I don't know, it's a quiet morning.
Well she said quiet time of the year this a bit.
Oh I said there's none  they're all queuing for papers and cigarettes.
Nobody at the counter for the  post office.
Okay now, if you go on th this path  whoops it's gone.
Eh?
It'll be underneath the floor.
Wait a minute.
Good job I brought you.
Where's the path gone?
Well it's under the floor.
I mean it's erm  you go, the underpass is there you see.
Mm.
Can you see the grass there?
Yes.
If you walk straight across that bit of grass there you'll come to the  path.
I don't have to go on the underpass do I?
Well there's no point really cos you have to go backwards and go under the underpass and then up there you see.
So I'm going left aren't I?
You're going, yeah.
Well the underpass takes you left if you see what I mean.
Yeah we're not going back to the underpass do 
But you don't, no.
You want to go u you see where that big tree is there?
Yeah.
So 
You want to go across the grass and you'll hit a path which goes left up there, past those houses.
I think I've done it once before.
Yeah.

Just that 
Oh sorry.
No it's alright, go on.

Yes, with Christopher.
And then we've got to take Christopher back to school  for the afternoon.
And then we'll go

He can climb through the middle.
Have you had a good morning?
Erm we discovered we could have come through this road here
Oh.
instead of going on that grass.
That would have been quicker would it?
I think, yes we're going to have to go back that way .
It depends which way you're coming.
Have you had a good morning sir?
That was quite quick.
I was there before it 
It is, it's not very far.
Did you have to wait for ages?
No.

Got no other way has she?
Cos

And it's a pretty  horrendous road.

We could have one of those.
I think we'll have a mass trip to the toilet before we go into the cafe.

You want to go again?
Yeah.

There you are.
When it goes straight on there it looks like  you're reversing backwards.

So you were in for ten minutes and rushed them out and out again then 
I was gonna get out a little bit earlier

well considering we were sick the day before I shall think that will really do us in 
The heater's nice and warm.
There's a heater in there is there?
Well in the changing rooms 
Oh well, you mean heat in the changing rooms
Changing rooms, there's quite a good heater
There's one in the  just by the er, the changing rooms, the, the erm lockers and I always choose a locker that 
You want the  ones 
yeah, yeah I always choose a locker that's between the
Dry your hair  got changed
I always pick that little spot to get changed in, oh, well see you all then, right, bye, bye Mark 
 

Oh  bye, oh hello , are you waiting for your mum or do you go home by yourself?
Well my mum stay there 
Bit of both oh right, that's a good idea, see you  Gone the wrong way   a post box got a letter to post 
Oh we will unless we've gone down the wrong hill  We'll have to practice the window cleaner one if you're going to read it to the rest of the class, have to practice the face and read it with expression so they don't all fall asleep   oh hello, hi.
Oh it's  
I know, my word, oh it's brilliant
and that's my eldest
I've got a new one tonight, I don't know how we're gonna cope with this, we've got, we've changed schemes now, we're into the Oxford 
Oh
I like the Oxford  it, the stories are really fun 
Oh yes, yes
Yeah
You'll be  
If I do
My children just love that  over there 
and yeah we'd like to keep ours till September, I don't know if we'll ever get, we will get a free new one ever?
Or do we have to have, we have to pay our ten P's,to park
Every 
Oh every year,oh well we've got a long time to keep it going , within about the first, within about the first month daddy managed to get the iron on the top
Oh, oh
on the left carried on  
 

well that's I thought when I saw it coming out I thought oh goodness this is gonna be ten P a week, that's the same for everybody, very good
How does 
and because it's slight yellow you don't lose it you know, if you keep all your stuff in it at home you can see it under the chairs and you know huh, find it again .
We, one doesn't try to lose things, but they just happen don't they really  I think I appreciate more now, you know when I was, when I was teaching I used to think oh stupid woman she's not, to bring this book in and you know, and now I think oh dear, huh, yeah and you also appreciate the people, I would appreciate now those who managed to do it every day without fail, manage to sort of let, because they must of put themselves out no end to have 
Yes 
done it as opposed 
keep in 
to those who think oh blow I can't find it just tough   mm
no  hope we don't lose it on that Tim, it's got all my money in at the moment, it's a really good one isn't it, we're really enjoying it at the moment  doesn't what number it is but we just, what do we do with this?
Something seven
Something seven, sixty seven perhaps even or seventy something, anyway whatever it's got money hasn't it?
It is
well we haven't seemed to  the new five P's
yeah, well I was gonna say those new five P's are  but you see you just get the new five P's and low and behold they will produce something else 
they change   hang on
oh yes
He's got chicken pox at the moment I think
Oh
I think she's probably just come out for a quick stroll, we won't spend our time over that at the moment,hello 
Hello 
alright?
Have they not had chicken pox?
Yes, ours have, yeah they probably passed it on in fact, kids probably passed it to them
Oh
weeks ago.
I was thinking I haven't heard him cry 
Is he happier?
Tim you mean?
No, that 
Oh that one
Yes .
I tell you something I was amazed at erm the reading book he appeared with, Fluff and Nip and goodness knows what that went out with the ark when I came out of college, I don't know whether they're all reading that or whether it's just sort of found them and must of been just perhaps a one off or something, but, I was amazed
no I don't think it is, I think it's probably got 
 
yeah
it's the moral, that's right, and the moral sounds, sounds good doesn't it, I don't know if it is, but it just sounds it I suppose 
Well I, I mean  
no, no
I mean I like  very much
yeah
yeah, could well be, I don't know what it is
if it's anything  school
no and I, I think particularly this new head seems to know exactly what she's doing, where she's going, I think it's excellent so I'm sure she's working everybody to death and I think that's brilliant 
Yeah
well I was worked to death 
if she  
when I first came out of college and I really appreciated it
well I, I, I 
you know you had high standards and you knew where you were aiming for and that's what I want my kids to go through as well, you know, somebody who's gonna do their best 
because it rubs off on them 
mm
it's, it's everybody around them got to try hard 
that's right , that's right
you know the stuff I mean they will 
yeah 
know that's there expect 
that's right and you know that if the staff has put theirselves out to make a decent crash in their environment they're gonna go mad at the children if they muck it up, so therefore, you know, you're gonna have that
yeah
I think that one of the  things that get me at the moment is the time keeping, it's very bad
mm
I mean they stroll in at quarter to nine and I think 
right, right 
I think that 
it's a bit bad that 
yeah
yeah, well I was there the other day and erm the bell went and nobody sort of moved and I thought I think, I know, you know, so I got up and I washed me cup of tea like, you know, they looked at me as if you know oh there's a keen  , but I mean I do think it's important to do that, because not only that it's not fair for the 
I think  the day you get  I've, I've  
dinner ladies, because I mean they're stuck out there you know doing their best.
cos  from their every angle a child needs 
yeah, yeah
cos it's  I mean my two I've always been very 
yeah
and they've never been late to their jobs 
I aim to get things there on time 
you know they've both got little jobs, they've never be late and they 
mm 
have to go and 
yeah 
all that sort of thing, but
yeah
I don't know what  strolling and 
yeah, you mean the children and the say rather than 
oh yeah 
the staff
oh yes, I meant the children 
yeah 
yeah, I was thinking of the parent and teacher side of it
oh yeah
yeah
you're waiting to go into assembly
yeah
I don't know, it should, to me  every day, one, two children you know 
yep 
I think  they're late every day
yeah 
once or twice 
they probably don't get up until quarter to nine, see they have a struggle really to get there on time 
I, I, if you can manage to get here for ten past nine every day, why can't you manage to get here for nine o'clock 
to get here for nine o'clock every day, yeah
it's five to it says on the bits of paper 
it's five to 
but then the bell doesn't go till nine, although sometimes it goes at two minutes to nine and sometimes it goes at five past nine
I think all the clocks are  
they say something different or something do they?
yeah , because I was in the  
Cos sometimes I think we've got hours and we hear bell going as we're coming up the hill and we think oh dear and then, you know, other times 
yeah 
we'll be sitting in the playground for ages, well standing in the playground for ages.
I think sometimes these things crop up 
Yeah
and we all get rather engrossed
yeah
and then everybody's gone to the classroom and you think oh gosh the bell
anyway I  
right, OK 
see you.
bye 
I have to do my own one
Mum
Hello  pardon?
It's mixed is it?
Yeah 
I told grandma that's what you want

Right, can we just move it  a bit, cos we've got to make the mixture we sort of have to do  
There's plenty of room  right, just gonna put, I was gonna put the rice up here cos otherwise there's not gonna be enough room
No
to make the mixture
I don't want to put the mixture in

Anyway, mummy , it's right at the back

Why?
I have to put in it
let's just see whether we should use  powder or not 
there  
eh, what are you doing, you're gonna end up in, having a salty biscuit if you're not careful, don't do it

Where's mine
well we only want one egg, but 
mum?
what you have to do is, Tim have the first go, we have to stir it round like that with a, with a fork, OK
Why didn't you let us crack the egg?
Watch it Tim and see what happens because that yellow bit will start mingling in with all the other bit.
That's the yolk in the middle 
Could you wash my fingers though
Can I wash your fingers 
My turn
you can wash your own fingers
what's roll it out for?
Roll it out, when you get a rolling pin and roll it out, that's when you need the cutters to make the shapes you see.
But why do you have to leave it in the fridge?
Your turn
You have 
Christopher , Christopher your turn
Here you are Christopher your turn, can you mix it better?
Have some more 
Make sure  the white , hold it still.
Mum we've got a scoop and we could put it in there
Right, do you want to see how it's really done, let me show you, watch, are you watch Tim, then you can try, watch 
Where?
There
you hold it like this look, hold the, the cup with, with the handle
  

and you hold your fork like that between the  and then you just whisk it
I got to whisk it, whisk it 
you go round and round very fast 
whisk it
that's it, fast 
Mum
it will be better if you put it in that toy machine mum 
 
and when we put it in that toy machine, we could mix it like that wouldn't need you to do it would it?
Not putting it in
Right that's  there all we need now is a little bit  be melted
Yes
Yes,melted
  
 
Not  do you want to see then?
Yeah
It's not quite finished melting yet so I'll just bring it over to see and have a look, can you see look it's still all bits, lumps and margarine in it.
Can you see the lumps of margarine?
Why isn't it brown?
Those lumps well that under there, can you see that?
I did stir the spoon 
Don't  make sure I got all mix in and then that, the other 
And it looks nice and it looks like cheese  
together 
It looks like cheese
It looks like, hardly mixes it does it?
Because the margarine is all on the top

Ooh
Can I have the ginger bread man?
Now that's the big stretched can you, if you just put your finger on there you'll see how sticky it is, can you feel it's warm and sticky and  
 
If we put it in the fridge it will make it go all cold 
Can I have another 
and then it won't be sticky, I can't roll it out to make those shapes at the moment cos it's too sticky, yes we're gonna have to stick it in the fridge and when it comes out it will be just ready then.

but we  that matter
And that didn't have  at all, we just made erm biscuit men.

It's apple, apple or apple, helicopter
Where's the banana that's there then?
The banana's are not meant to be
No they're not,is anybody starving I want  
I'd rather have have a cup of tea 
Well there's apple and the cake   is it wet?
Yeah
cos I wash them
turn it round 
Yes please, is the helicopter sounds as if it's going to the hospital, oh yes, look there it is, ever so close, can you see it Tim?
Yeah, is it going to the hospital?
Probably.
Why is it going 
Well sometimes they fly things in and fly things out.
Flies it out
Like kidneys 
properly
well it's true, that's what they're doing  just the while we're having our tea 
But then, the usual  at Birmingham station 
Yeah, what do you mean by happily being sarcastic?
Yeah, very, mind you 
Mind you, it's probably 
it wasn't really their fault, there was a big  factory 
 
in Banbury
Mm
and it upset erm, the first thing we  it weren't  
Mum can I have another  
 
train from, to Redditch and it was 
Yeah
and all the .
We are very sorry the train at number eleven  platform eleven, when you get to Lemington on it, get out if you're going to Banbury, there will be a coach, because there's a fire at Banbury, well I thought it meant there was something on the other side of the railway, it was, a factory near there so, so then er they get you in  
Are we meant to eat these before the cake, is that the idea?
Or is that what everybody's doing?
I'll wait, I'll tell you the story about the fire
Yes, you carry on talking while we chomp
they, they all sitting on, a few of us sitting on the seat, the girl that was all shaky she was going for an interview at a Birmingham University  another lady was going on to Northfield
 
well you're alright , you'll be alright we said if you get on the train where we get on, you're OK, so they get, getting out 
It's a place I really like
What place?
Erm then we said er another  the train to such a place will be quarter of an hour late, we're very sorry cos it's held up, everything was standing outside the station, er they're all held up with this fire at Banbury, was upsetting everything
This is a bit odd cos Banbury's got a long way to travel
no, but it was upsetting all these  journey 
why didn't they get rid of the train to Banbury?
Ah? so eventually we got on 
Well do , do a lot of the trains go through Banbury?
One an hour 
I thought they would oh 
about one an hour
this happened to be the hour you see and it was on
O six past the hour
Yeah, yeah six minutes past the hour so there, yeah, so they kept giving you doubts, now if you're getting on this train make sure you get out at Lemington, so at about twenty past twelve, the twelve six went out from platform eleven, why, cos that will upset everything then, by, few of the trains kept coming round, then they said were very sorry but the Shrewsbury train will come in at platform ten  that's where we're all waiting, so the ready  train be outside somewhere, so, that came in just as the, the twelve, six went out about twenty past twelve these  in and this girl got up so we said don't get on this, you'll never get to Birmingham   you get on here, wait until we get on we said, cos they changed the train, oh she was getting all worked up, she come from Middlesborough, well I said well, well, anyway, we said no, there, there's no trains for university no, nobody will be going at the right time will they?
there will be quarter of an hour so it's 
Yes but, yes but you see they got so mixed up that the ,
There's a helicopter again 
the  Longbridge train, weren't a Longbridge train but 
Where?
Don't know, I can hear it
the Longbridge train was still outside at twelve six  been out there, so a little bit they gave 
You miss  
the little bit they gave out the Longbridge train then they said oh know the twelve O six 
that 
there it is, oh look
Ah
Yeah  ain't it?
Well it's the 
So he, they got themselves right mixed up, platform changed 
 
He'll go round again 
What's it 
circle again
There's another one
Another one?
Yeah, there's two
Oh something's up 
Not that cloudy though
Yeah there's one there
that's it?
oh dear 
Oh  
They will have to wait to come in now 
Definitely two of them just see the other one's just going over the  
yeah, yeah they will have to wait to come in won't they?
only two, one after the other
Yeah
Exciting  two lots of kidneys 
Yeah well  changes platforms of all these trains, anyway after a bit we decided that the Redditch train was going to come in before the  train, so, er they didn't change it to say it wasn't going to Redditch  cos once when I was doing that they said to me, the lad was it,because it's not to ready to change that time, you wouldn't matter, cos oh there's people here waiting to go to Redditch, change it, so he said oh  anyway it came, the twelve six came  all the young folks going to  you should of seen the number that had got off  
altogether aren't they?
Oops
but er, a lot of them got on the twelve six, you goes  the twelve thirty one  any way we waved to her when she got on it  the coach you see was full at Bart Green, you got, at Redditch
Did you not get on it then?
Oh well, yes
Is there every time when 
 
cos I mean there must be quite
it wasn't 
Mum 
completely full
Yeah, people were having two seats to one person 
That's right they only have it off the 
and when it comes to the  
There's a bit of apple there  
There, that's OK, don't worry, do you need to go to the toilet?
Have a look see, got a bit of apple there
Yeah, please go to the toilet before my cake  come on
He'll want to go to the toilet when you start blowing the candles out little horror
I'd should go too if I were you.

Mm you'd want more than  would you?
Fourteen, fourteen
What's fourteen?
I wouldn't want more than  
These things 
because  different 
There be twelve , there's eight there, nine, ten, eleven, twelve 
Oh no  
So you want 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I want drink 
Mum , I remember bit which I don't like of the cake 
Mm 
You see the top bit over the top?
mm
It's not that picture of what he said it's the little bit in there
Mm, I like that 
I like that 
Mummy
I like the black chocolate bit 
mummy  
it's between bit I don't like
Oh
I thought it was very nice, I enjoyed it all
Well worth the  I suppose dear 
All of us finished , all of us finished
I know
Mum
You did very well to have gone  birthday and get home in time for, whatever time it was you did 
You birthday mum can have all of that 
I did actually go into Sainsbury's on the way home, but I
Did you?
They haven't got any thing have like, no, I tried that with er Tim, cos Sainsbury's would of been really more on your way wouldn't it?
Yeah
Naughty mummy
You haven't got any  
She had  
I'm surprised at that
It's probably because
They have
a shopping Sainsbury's 
They had 
 
individual things, you can buy sort of individual cream cakes and things like that from the bakers actually, you can't buy like individual ones 
They might have them frozen in the frozen bit, frozen gateaux and stuff
But it's not quite the same with sort of birthday cake with a fancy thing round it is it?
Mm 
I've shown him these  I've show him that thing where 
Christopher staring again
Mummy
So we're gonna get the original magazine or have you already got it?
You can buy it yes
Well I, I think they will give it to us, cos er, Martin what's his name  said that we'd get complimentary copies, yeah you mustn't touch those Tim cos those are matches and children never, never touch matches do they?
Why?
Because if they suddenly catch fire guess what would happen?
We shall lose him
All the house will be burnt down
And you as well 
and be very, very sad
and you'd get very sad and it would hurt a lot.
All day
Yes 
Mm 
And all of us wanna be burnt
Yes 
Yes all of us could get burnt
and all our things
and your guitar, everything 
But even if we ran out 
Well we  but the house wouldn't would it?
It would be sad if we lost everything wouldn't it?
So you won't play with matches?
If you get a match and you strike it on something else it would still
Yes, it can do
And we get out all the way 
even the box if you strike it on that, that will
But it strikes on particular things, it strikes on something rough, but you never quite know, know what, not, no good trying it out because you never quite know whether it's going to strike or not, when you get to be older, we'll allow you to strike a match, but you have to be quite older to do that 
Mummy 
we'll show you how it works 
It's best to know isn't it?
I did  
I'd rather be around at the time 
That's why you stand and play with matches 
Mm  mind you some children fish about it in cupboards don't they?
Oh  
You know high up 
Cos high up, erm, I usually  ten people before they reach

Yes you did all of that, you did all about the  
 
I don't think we did this one properly did we?you only use your right hand cos you push on that foot
yeah, look, there's a C remember, then it changes a note to a D
Then D 
That's it, find your C
Yeah that's the C now you go like this 
And where's your D?
You go like this do you?
C 
That's it, but use this finger this time
No you go C, D, C, D
You do more or less go like it
but not quite, we shall just have to see how it goes

Mum 
Mum, can I have a whole piece of toast please?
No,
Is Tim having it?
It's 
Oh dear
Mum
I just wondered 
I forgot to  
Oh dear
  

I spoke to  that was Monday night, yeah, she's been head of department, did I tell you that?
You didn't say anything about that 
Oh right,I thought I told you then.
No,
Oh, well she rang up, I've seen Christopher in the catalogue
actually
and
they
and could ask if publications can 
the one that we see
We've seen the book

Oh, oh no, you're getting confused, you know the book that is out, that is on 
Yes , yes
beginning careers, well it is in a catalogue, the book is in a catalogue, yeah, so there's a front cover of the book sitting in the catalogue smiling at her, saying please buy this book of Christopher.
Oh I see, so he's even more liked
Yeah 
We don't want to buy it, we just want the catalogue 
I see, oh 
So she's ordered it because 
 

she's started Liam, they're having a pre-packed school at Durham choir boys, whatever it is, cos he's from school,apparently the locality of demanding six year olds and under  so they and another la labouring school 
Oh  
Oh Tim

Anyway  
 
I've had enough
Right, just, she said she's going to be head of department, it starts at ten  OK, so she'll be ahead of herself, then as  she'll be responsible for getting staff  said she still hasn't, got  she said, little love 
I didn't want a, a whole
Timothy wanted the whole dear
They've both got whole
Oh that's clever
That's it
They  they both had half a whole, I thought that's what you said half a whole 
 
 
Oh dear, yeah that was my fault, sorry  now if you have my plate then you won't have any trouble with that  erm, what  
Erm, I'll eat the half 
Teach us what age are they?
Erm, erm

read
I guess she really liked those, she only got moved because of er the 
Yeah
spread it
I am
Hurry up cos he wants the margarine, can he have the margarine while you're spreading on?
I think you've got enough there haven't you?
Mum
Mm
I've had the 
Did you?
Yeah I had it go over there 
When we've had half a whole, I'm thinking half a whole
we have got half a whole
No they've got half a whole
Oh, they've also got half a 
Yeah
I thought I was making the best of both answers
You were dear, very clever 
I can do it, how can you tell the difference?
Well there's two different wholes aren't there?chop toast  you can chop either that way or that way

What you do?
It's a day, trip
What day?
Computers, you know, software on computers.
Well I tried to get on one on Monday
 

I tried to get on one two Mondays ago in Redditch
and they told me that I was too late, the school told me too late 
 
so I rang up the place and said I would like to go are you having another?
 
They said there's a possibility of one coming erm April in Kidderminster if you're interested and I said well I would be interested  
 
now it says I'm now able to offer you the arranged dates 
 
for the  update for Friday  
Oh
There's no trouble is it really, just the morning as well as the afternoon and collecting Christopher as well 
Quite, I can't 
It starts at nine fifteen, so I'd have to bring him over to you quite, quite early
You bring him to me and then 
Yeah
and then I can take you home afterwards, see if it finishes at three I won't be home till quarter to four at the earliest
Oh we should just be right, won't we?
Yeah  oh I'll enjoy that, it'll be a nice little trip please bring 
 
a packed lunch, coffee will be provided, no funding available for travelling or subsistence costs, typical 
 
they always do this on a supplies teacher, you have to go because you want to do it 
 
Well this is a cheek really because I should imagine it's one of the most 
 
over subscribed courses as well, I mean when I went on the language and, and the national curriculum and that other thing that I did on the national curriculum, masses of people there.
What are you thinking of 
Is his face 
I did
I thought what a pretty thing to do 
Are you happy to do it, are you away or here?
I won't be able away I don't think
Fifteenth of April
That's the week before
I was hoping they weren't gonna put it on a silly day
That's erm 
Is it?
I'm gonna wake you up 
When's Easter then?
End of April isn't it?
Oh, it could well be then
Mary's talking about
Oh will she be here
Right, those poor  need feeding again  
They don't go 
Doing what you told me to unload it 
Oh I'm really pleased about that, cos last time on a, I was really disappointed I'd been refused the course cos I thought oh, it'll be right up my street that, cos when I was teaching full time I was quite into these er computers at the beginning and the one that went  
That's too much 
miles out.
You know if it had been in  
It's too much 
It's not too much, it's fine, you watch them gobble it down, only because it spreads out 
Ah
because they've been so much more technology, you know, since it's started 
Oh I know yes
I don't want 
You want to know the latest 
Yeah, and er, apparently there's a thing called in the afternoon it's called erm software for survivors  
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get under 
Sounds like a good scheme 
your hands
Oh are you?
Oh I wondered what you doing
Ah here's Jo's birthday card 
Pull any harder, you'll go flop if I let go
I what?
If I let go you'll go on the floor
Yeah 
Oh dear, terrible.
here's hoping your birthday will be unfrogettable  and the frog hopping about on it.
Who was that?
From Jo?
Yeah
Come on then
Yeah, oh that's very nice, a book token as well, three pounds
  

I like a book token cos I always feel a bit guilty buying books you know, cos I've got so many  
I do, I think I've got  somebody buying me another so I go and look into that oh I do what Mavis does now, she goes and looks in the book shop
And then goes to the library to get the book she wants 
like that, you know she didn't 
Oh
If it's a book token that's it isn't it really?
take them back.
Mavis stands in the book shop writing the name and the things down you see and then she goes  to the library, she hasn't been out properly yet with her knee has she?
Who we talking about?
Mavis.
No, she said in her letter, that she hasn't, well it was just a little square of paper, what are you doing dear?
Oh running round the room with a tape measure 
Clocks says
Clock says half past twelve nearly.
Mummy bed time
Oh no, surely not
It's  all the way round here and under there 
Twenty five past eleven, he should be asleep now.
Huh, Michael gave Gill erm a sun bed 
Oh where's  sleep
A what?
a sun bed for her birthday, to encourage her to rest
Oh
cos she won't stop, she won't put her feet up, you know she's pregnant 
That's when we go to sleep 
Ah?
You know she's pregnant?
Oh yeah I know that
She still rushes about like I don't know what
That's when we go to sleep 
So er , he's given her a sun bed 
Is the hand on the two?
I think that's rather clever 
A two?
You look, a little hand on the two and a big hand on the seven
two
Has er Andrew recovered from his tiredness then?
Me?
Or is he still tired?
Oh we were fine last night, we just sat plonked in front of Inspector Morse all night, you know, every time the er
it was nice  video is
but we just got the
the, erm you know like when the telephone goes and you think oh rats I'm gonna miss the programme
You can stop it
you can, wonderful, so every time the telephone went, which was quite a few times, we stop it and then we, you know, we fancied supper in the middle and oh it was nice 
I missed you 
I think I have to get one.
Well play the game with me, well it was very pleasant I must say 
Well Laura's got one, the more that you,the more you look at 
It's a luxury though, I mean you know, you don't need it, the fact that we got one for Christmas it was very nice, but 
Well I was only thinking that there's not much on the television so
No, and so, but you can choose what you want to use, to watch the video I mean I find it particularly good with children, we'd 
I don't, I don't think  not really 
hardly ever watch the children's programmes official
We you know we watch bit's and pieces if we 
Right then, Christopher likes this, that Wild one 
Yeah, the Really Wild Show yeah  She can't manage normal size 
What does she have big ones?
No loads of little ones
Three
when she goes out for a meal she's got a problem, now if that was me I'd be having loads of big ones  
Oh dear, quarter past.
Ten, you've got the big hand on three and little hand on ten
No we didn't   that's ten, that's eleven, six, ten and then ten and then twelve and they
Do you think he's worn out our little friend?
No.
This little friend?
No, he kept waking up constantly, you, didn't you?
You kept shouting for mummy or daddy or somebody 
What you keep waking up for?
Yeah
You're a silly 
You go to bed to sleep
I waked up 
He seemed to be awake for a long time, I think, you know like you wake up and you don't know what to do with yourself, I think it was like that, so every quarter of an hour or so he kept me, shouting for a drink he didn't know quite what to do with himself 
Yeah.
Your mother used to sleep like a log
and she still  
that 
Oh that's a very nice letter, I was just thinking that maybe erm Jill hasn't got her birthday card cos she's the type of person who would write and say thank you, you know to me
She has got your address?
She has got it and it was a lengthy letter so, but I thought it would be included in my birthday present
Oh no
but she's not, she's done it separate, in fact I think that second class stamp 
Has she got gone going to school?
Oh yeah
Is she not  
She's going to carry on till 
Touch that 
first of 
touch that 
May
Touch that 
Cos  
Oh I like that  
they always told you what date you got
She's got six weeks, well you can go on it when you like really, well, you 
 
no well, what they do is they tell you the earliest you can leave and then you can leave after that if you prefer
give you a date and that was it.
Right 
Still got it
I was lucky, cos I had the summer holidays
Right
included in mine, so it meant that they paid me for the summer holidays cos I didn't officially really 
No 
I hadn't officially stopped work till the first of September.
Catch, catch
I got paid for August which was quite clever really   cos my date would of been sort of half way through to book my holiday
What am I supposed to do with this?
Hold it tight mummy  I can tell you that   if I let go you'll let  on the floor.
What's this crayon doing down here?
Oh he's been 
Crayon 
crayoning
Oh he's been crayoning OK.
he's been doing a blue track sort of something
Yeah, yeah he's doing  blue 
, see I've got it.
That's because  I didn't have time to sit and colour with him  so he decided he'd do it all blue himself didn't you?
He hasn't done any green trees either
I  one box.
Yeah you can go and bring something else done.
I only brought that one down because we haven't seen it for a long time, just choose one 
I'm allowed to  
thing that you want to play with don't just bring down any old thing 
Don't bring down the box just bring something, one thing.
A game perhaps, that'd be nice.
Have we got time for a game?
It's twelve o'clock nearly
Mm 
So we're not having Matthew any more
Well we might do
Mm, when grandma's got better
Exactly
but I'm not erm, putting myself out, it's like  like April the fifteenth and everything
if you bring them over to my house
Does it say I've got to do anything about it or does it say I'm on it anyway 
Do you have to write in to say that you accept it?
No, I don't think so, if you are unable to attend on this date please contact Janet  at ITS Worcester, well I am able to so that's it then, enclosed a map, look forward to seeing you, jolly good  should be exciting, I'll never find me way round Kidderminster 
You did say you wanted I say you did say you wanted to go didn't you?
Oh yeah, oh I said I was very keen  Zian Hill, School
Does Christopher, haven't they got any, does Christopher do any er,com computers  
I  with a game 
Oh yeah, he's done loads of it 
He's not really not really mentioned it
Mm, I think they have a system whereby they have it in the classroom for a week
And then somebody else has it 
and then somebody else has it, so it's sort of once a month or something it turns up and they have sort of an extensive thing on it, I think that's the way it works.
Oh that's nice you've brought the tractor down 
Mum
can't make out where this school is
mum
down Birmingham Road, there we are,
mum
I can see it
see
Have you got his name down on a  creche then or not?
Who Tim?

I don't know, I hope so 
I wanna play snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders, you haven't tidied up that yet.
 

Better tidy up that game before we play snakes and ladders
Where's snakes and ladders I know
I don't know, you should know, not me
I do, in this cupboard
Is it?
It might be on the top
Where?
on the shelves

Why?
Mm  and I was told at one stage that they used to revert back to Yorkshire
You're not now, it was true when Tim was  mm
he's asked me to say things,I  no you've not said it like you do  
That was  that one
Is it?
Thirty odd years in Manchester is definitely er
I expect it would wouldn't it?
  

Pardon?
I don't 
My dear, oh I'm sorry
all the time
yeah  well grandma wasn't listening properly, there you are
Oh, I feel quite pleased having cleaned everywhere and popped  I feel like I can embroider the rest of the day now 
Oh if my

in the fridge
It's always such a hassle you're trying to do something  and you're just gonna have 
Your don't then 
got to provide activity
I used to get that  you
Oh
well you do.
It's a play or to deliver home?
Yeah, no it's a play  get the jobs done and then we used to deliver them back again up the street and one of us used to go in, I used to divert to Derby 
We don't have any erm Chris has never bothered us bring people back from school, I don't think he knows them that well, well I mean he does know them, but they're not really his type, you know,
He  you can imagine that
What?
In  man not seeing them at.
No, I mean he's quite happy being there with them
Mm
and I've heard him say oh can I go and play with such a boy, he said he likes going to Kirsty, Kirsty and Hannah and Kirsty and Graham he's quite fond of them too and Adam
But he's a little loner ain't he?
and all those really
Mm
are sort of his type of player
mm
see what I mean?
He gets fed up if people don't play properly
Likes to set things out and make them go you know
Mm
rather than throw it about
mm
quite a certain little somebody we all know he's toys do it, no I  put it there.
They played ever so well this morning didn't you?
What were you playing this morning when you got up, you and Christopher?
Didn't you have a game?
Snakes and ladders
Was it snakes and ladders this morning?
Oh no it was a tractor thing wasn't it, or did you play snakes and ladders as well?
Snakes and ladders
I've noticed he takes things from Christopher now
Mm
and we didn't go and sleep 
He fell off to sleep
cos we did go up ladders
Did you, didn't you go on any snakes?
No
Huh, good ain't it?
Yes, there's definitely there some proving, mind you, you'll have to pick the right time of day, do you know what I mean?

Mm.
I was very  when he said he didn't like it for sure,
Well he's like that  different taste, never sort of with Christopher stands for what he likes and what he doesn't like, shall we mix it round a bit more to mix in?
No,
Yeah

Watch what you're doing, I don't want it on me 
Do you like it?

Same as mine
Same as yours, yeah, I've given up buying funny flavours now I just buy strawberries cos nobody ever  liked them 
Mm, I don't blame you, not many of the cos some of them are, are a wretched likeness.
Well I like, usually I like three out of the four and then nobody seems to like the fourth
Nobody, so you're left with it

That's his favourite 
And he likes all long

You like pineapple 
I like pineapple and we like

Mm, yeah, that's true  
 
Weren't  things when you were a little girl, it didn't have bits like that, a lot of things come in that we didn't use to have

Weren't 
No they wouldn't be when I'm des when they're desperate, everybody rings me when I'm  
well I don't want too much, see what I mean
Mm
having told them to stay at home with Tim, I don't want to be
it's not fair to him, I mean when he's old enough to understand
Well it's quite fun just going off for the odd day cos then he goes off to see Ian, he enjoys that  but it was two afternoons last week cos I did Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon
It's not bad really normally 
I've a , well she's dumped hers on me
I mean she's got two children to dump on me so, I don't feel bad about that  in, that we know, we decided that's what we, we didn't mind doing and there no trouble, if fact they're less trouble cos they're together than they are 
You going to go teaching?
no, we're just talking about when I did last week  remember when I went teaching last week and you went to Ian's house didn't you?
Went in two afternoons 
Has Martin got chickenpox then?
Yeah  anyhow I think she's hoping to come to  tomorrow  cos erm, idea in the air that on Maundy Thursday instead of having an ordinary mums and toddlers we'll have a  in church for half an hour and then a run around cups of coffee with the big toys in the hall,a good idea
Mm
That'll be a nice idea, it's a bit tricky, you remember the Chris  what we did at Christmas, that went really well, and we thought perhaps something similar book for Easter, yeah, don't know what we'll do but   cos people like John and , so he's not teaching full time, in fact some of the schools have holiday aren't they?
Mm  that's why I thought you wasn't doing anything on that day,
Well she wasn't going to and then the elections got in the way.
Got to, are we having that thing?
Well we still don't know about that, and it said in the paper that they're having election in the church hall, nobody in the church knows about it.
Mm, can't get it if they don't 
So if they don't act, they've had it, but, if they wrote and asked quick then 
It's got to be someone with a 
 
with a caretaker hasn't it be elect them, there isn't one is there?
Why a caretaker?
To open it up and see to it 
Why can't they?
don't usually.
Oh, they will have to if they want to won't they?
Pay the caretaker 
Well in that case I expect, you know, some of us could become a caretaker if they're having to pay us 
you'll be up there for seven in the morning
That's alright, open it up and then what do you do keep puffing along and sweeping it up whether it's put 
 
cigarette ends on the floor
They could do.
there not to smoke in the place 
 
but I bet they will 
Our Man , our Manchester buses are not smoking
Are they?
They've  down now
Very good, I don't see why we couldn't be really, it's so horrible for everybody else.
and Birmingham station
We're desperate for those at work 
Birmingham station is non smoking
Mm, I've noticed that one
They give them all 
Well that's sensible for 
It is, they've give it out on the trains as you're coming in
Oh
please remember Birmingham is treated as a no smoking area, if you are smoking put your lights out 
Mm, mm,of the King's Cross Society you could have a King's Cross 
Well that is it 
in Birmingham's Station couldn't you?
I, well that's why they put all those election round the
Mm
Is that what all this refurbishment's been about?
Mm, mm, cos of King's Cross, had to come at all it's awful and one time you just went straight on the escalator and now you've got to go

With grandma?
telly
Something else on the telly with grandma, what will it be grandma?
I don't know 
Twenty past one what do you normally watch, Charlie Chalk no?

Probably watched the video didn't you?
Video I think we had on 
I know something at twenty past one on B B C two but I wouldn't like to say what
I don't know what it is now, erm
he probably don't need to watch the telly for the rest of the time
we didn't, we, we went in there and played a game last week before we, we played a game
cos we done not a lot this morning like I just sort of be zombies, I'm sure we could do play with  
I've had enough.

think you should, I don't think that we should have an apple if we're not finished our yoghurt, do you?
I had enough
Well if you've had enough that's it then we'll lose it and we don't do anything else  cos we can't keep doing that leaving half a bits and that, this and that

What's floating?
What do you think those children are doing there?
What's floating?
Victoria what does it mean to float?
You do in a swimming pool because what happens to you, it makes you keep up the top doesn't it?
So if you place it 
 
if you float you'll stay at the top, some people can float and they don't need arm bands, they stay at the top and if you sink they go to the bottom, now we've got to look at these things look and we've got to decide whether we think they're gonna float, stay on the top or whether they're going to sink and go to the bottom, now then what's this here?
What's that called, do you know?
No, it's called a cork, cork, you feel it Victoria and tell me what do you think, you think that's gonna sink or do you think it's gonna float?

Float, why do you think it will float?
It's light
You think it's light so it can float.
You'll think it'll sink don't you, why do you think it'll sink?

No
I was just thinking of two minutes ago like last week

all two minutes I thought, oh she's brought song books home, she's keen and enthusiastic with
that, because it would of been a lot of effort on part 
I would, I, I just get them out .
You were damn rude darling
Yeah
being in an attitude you've forgot to
, no it's alright.
But it's more convenient for you to go in that church if anybody else

Probably a bit of a strain  
Nice school?

it won't be

Oh, well they're not going tomorrow 
Oh, must be Friday then, I knew they were going away for the week, weekend
That's very nice too.
The first time
were saying this 
It's tricky to have to get here
I know 
the evil look, I shall move in a minute 
Bite back 
Funny old tramp , the leaves fall of him without those, they get stalkier and stalkier as time goes on
Yeah, yeah well I've got an ordinary 
 
A
pot, it came from
I've got an ordinary
just keep peeling the bottom ones off it, just get
missing
My yucca's dying
Oh dear
That could well be the compost, poor leaves and things
Maybe
Well I think I've over watered it
Best to let it 
 
I know I'm, I'm
I don't water mine very often I wait till the, one of the leaves start to go a bit yellow and then
Oh
I don't like them personally
Why not?
somebody else wanted one 
I hated it 
Ah, there you are.
similar to
chopped it up and then
and I've got twins
Oh that's nice
We've got one at work that looks like a tree 
together?
it's about twelve feet, no, yeah about twelve feet tall.
I've put it on the stairs you see so it's got like double height to go to, it's nearly filled that, the thing is, the
at the bottom then about six foot gap and then
at the top
Yeah,
the
the branch goes to the top
You won't do it like that, you'll have to sort of 
I suppose a handle of
 

Well now, that'll do us
instead of having, I mean you don't think at the time, but what she should of said was can I go away, come back for another interview another day, which means she, she's
for the hour because all she could think of was this
of course if she told me as soon as she'd done it
Yeah
I cou , I would of said well right tell them
yeah, yeah
Mm
ask them for another go, of course she left it till she had the results and then told me  so I'm writing now to the
yeah
Mm.
so, cos she's stuck in working 
Even if she's not 
selling curtains for them and erm obviously she was 
Is there anybody we know that's any good at tuitioning?
Oh, I come back from
of private lessons but I just really can't get a grip of it.
No, I meant just sort of somebody we know
What would we have to do?
The trouble is that 
like if you were dyslexic I could help you.
I could help with maths
You've got to know the syllabus though and you've got to know what, I don't know what
Yeah you've got to know what you're doing
It's not a case of helping because in the letters I know what, I know what I'm doing, I'm just, I'm just gone to,
yeah
I've got everything right, actually what I did and I couldn't give you, I haven't got a clue, trigonometry, well I couldn't tell you how to do it, I should
 
That's why you need somebody you can ring up and say look, we did this yesterday what am I doing wrong today?
Yeah.
It goes out my head from one week to the next, I can't keep it, I know what I'm doing 
Keep it up 
at the time
some sort of
but again if, if somebody who knows about the G C S E actual course 
 
you know the G C S E, did you know about
yeah I did that at school 
Someone must teach it somewhere.
Erm, oh erm 
Who?
Mike 
I was gonna say Mike  has had a degree in that
He
but he might know
What you'd have to do, you know, you tell him what you need to know, he'll be able to tell you how to do it.
Oh I don't even wanna do it, I just need
It's good book though isn't it?
books here, yeah, I just, read them, I don't know if I can do it I
but it, he needs to find out what he needs to teach you through the book so you know
What you need to do is to find
books are they
a memory thing, that will, you know, click your memory, you know how some people have an a
yeah 
well
I know what you mean
I can just remember though you know over the 
 
No I remember 
I just need something that reminds you of what you've done rather than, er 
Like my
I just can't remember that twenty 
Well, you'll pass
No you don't pass or fail you get given marks out
Yeah, but I mean you only
that was
and I'd written down
just sit down and listen, then read the question wrong
write down the answer
anything from 
What I could never do was
but I could never do them
being those things like well I can't do those tables 
all the 
 
and what not 
at all, I've never since a child remember
Well you should of been learning those
I've tried, I can't for the life of me remember them 
I can't remember 
I've tried
 
Can you get up to five, fives?
twenty five
Yeah, but can you get up to that, like get all your other tables?
No, I can't remember 
 
 
Right, you know the twos, threes and fours and fives tables?
Twos no, no
Oh dear
I can't do them, I've learnt them
sixes onwards I'll show you how dyslexic to do it with their hands 
I've got my sheet of paper 
You don't need 
 
One two 
Ooh somehow.
We learnt them by chart.
Yeah I did that at school we had to stay in most break times as a child cos I couldn't remember, and I, I know that my mum bought me a books so I used to sit for days and days, then my mum going over and then my nan going over and I couldn't remember if I wanted to 
The number you have put them together in different places and as usual I got the numbers that fell of the 
couldn't sort out, so those things, bit confusing so
complicated when you start it out, but if you can't remember for the life of you then, it's quite
Yeah I have to do it, you know, four, fours, five, fives erm providing I remember those middles then I can carry on, anything over 
I know 
you know, say seven, sevens I know are forty nine
Mm
so that eight sevens are fifty six and I carry on from there, but you can't do that 
you've got to have something like
well I, I
I can't do it, yeah I can't do it
And are there things like that then, tables?
Or is it more complicated?
Yeah I was gonna say 
No, they're much more complicated, if you get an equation what's X
Right
and you've gotta find, you've gotta know what happens 
I'll take Wednesday 
Yeah
and like they give you a secret number of what comes next
Yeah
I could never do those of, I never got one of those right.
I would hate to do that orally I could only do that with
I think
Yeah
You can write it down, by the time you've written it down and thought about it
Should of had the answer
yeah, I find that, that I've done it and I've written down the answer and then I can't think which number does it go to, and by the time I've got to number one they're on about six, so I might as well, I'm lost it completely, so I can't do that either and my project work, course work, goes towards certain percent of my marks and I can't think for the life of me why
cos I don't want
you get one percent on explaining how you do it
so that's that, I can't rely on my course work for my marks so that's
I can't do it, so that I've got to get full marks for the exam to pass, without the other two bits on it, I can't do that
Why is the project work so
You don't have to have English?
No, cos I'm old
Brilliant cos I
pass mark, I've done the work and I've
We've all stood teaching, I've got maths I haven't got English.
This is, is this O level?
A level English, Language and Literature I'm doing which isn't really
but I might not pass, I haven't got the time and difficult when I'm working I can't
if I start and it starts getting boring
motivation is
I can do an essay to prove I can
It's all too much for me
That can go next
Yeah
They're nice
these two, really nice, I like this one
exactly that's what I was thinking 
you could come on our weekend if you're not going
if you're not going to
cos they're going all weekend
Did he tell you?
He said, he was hoping to go and work there, so
And what did he say, three months?
For a year and that's all I need
this is what he would liked to do
Too frightened to ask him now
No we don't about it
oh
because he told me
Oh I think we will, well it's
yeah after a year, yeah
Unless he can get a work permit 
been before he said, yeah, and come back 
They don't always come back, they don't always use the
the main thing being 
I know if going for at least 
luckily
 

Anyway, unfortunately he was gonna go in 
I wasn't 
October which is a pity really cos that was when our weekend
ooh quite keen 
Enjoyed your 
for a year?
quite keen, well it isn't as if I'm gonna stay for a year, he's sort of thinking sort of you know going out there to work and I
What does he do?
 

See it driving, actually see me driving
Yeah
car park, drove in very slowly
me driving this blooming car
somebody saw me
crash
got the keys out, pressed the alarm, hello , I'm quite impressed, cos my car's a scrap heap
And why is your car a scrap heap?
cos I haven't got any money to do it up, nineteen sixty
no 
really, you see I was hoping that I was going anyway to
and that was gonna be it, I won't need it any more, but it turns out that I will so I'll, I've got a car
Oh I  patched together
Right this is er
both 
I have you know I've been going round and testing how many miles per galleon you can get out of it
Per galleon?
per galleon, yeah 
Well that's the trouble really, it's
Good
get depressed about it, I've been feeling very depressed about it
Why?
You still very depressed about it?
Remind him Barry he's got something to ask Pat 
 
homework afterwards
I don't know I
You might have a bit of a whirl 
 
project
I can't do it, I'll try 
 
Well ask him, he can only say
You're not
No I'm not .
Are you comfortable there?
It's surprising
Oh I've got a lovely
Lucky girl, what about your toes?
the one I had, Ernie my instructor at work was this thick from bottom to top
Well it would look such a
and they were black
obvious
this thick 
this thick 
and I didn't change them all day cos I haven't got any money to buy any more so I have to wear them 
Why not, you should put one of hers on and say it was patterned
No, it was horrific, it really did look
I ask you and someone got up and like turned the
Oh do you want bits and pieces back? 
Are we
how embarrassing, what will that be?
We've raised  half that size
I don't think I've ever had that amount in it 
cos really, we didn't really go into cost relations
No

That's right, they're all then
Mind you they must go somewhere I don't know where, cos we never pick them up 
I know that 
no, you've got a point really
No  I'm sure it's good for the ground
It's like all these people that go out really cleaning the leaves up
Oh I know, well we have to do some because if we didn't we'd be under thick feet
yeah
but we only just do it
yeah, but I can't see the point only we never do

It was yeah, Jamie's mummy said it was going to rain this afternoon didn't she?
I
it's daddy actually.
A big tummy
And, and
Yes
They let off a little despondent these mums and toddlers thinking oh the best bit of the day, and they forget, it wasn't.
And it was a very nice mums and toddlers, hardly anybody turned up too
Why was that?
I don't know, last week we were absolutely packed out and then this week
Are they all ill this week?
Well either ill or else they've gone  you know cos it's a nice day out  don't know.
All I know is
There are quite a few chickenpox cases.
Why
What did you do Tim at mothers and toddlers?
I played
Yeah, what did you play with?
Anything special?
We had a
Try it again Tim daddy didn't quite understand, say it again.
The prince and the
No, no, he's talking about a story
Oh
A story
story
looking in the windows
Looking in the windows?
Mm, mm
What?
and he be'd a fire engine 
Aah 
Is this er Christopher's book?
Yep
The one about mummy 
It's mine 
Yeah mummy, mummy the window cleaner went to rescue some people along came the fireman
Mums and toddlers thought it was wonderful, we only had half a dozen you see in there cos it was low numbers all round so we had low numbers in the
as well, had a little do with a little boy called Shane, he decided he wanted to come into the story with a, in his blue car, I explained that on the day of the choose he could either come in and have a story or he was to play with the blue car outside, well he had a fit, he's rattling the door, anyway, I didn't realize there was this childminder that he had with him not er his mum, cos she came and had her sort of say and things
we finished the story and we got onto the rhymes I presume and a little body sidled in through the win through the door and he sort of sat there looking pathetic you know, I said would you like to come and sit on my knee?
No he said, and I went over and I picked him up anyway, and sat him on, I sat him on my knee and I said we'll just do some rhymes and I could feel him sort of going mm, mm, mm, like they do all pathetic and whiny, anyway  Phyllis arrived and afterwards it was, by then he had calmed down and he was fine and I said wanna read the story now cos he missed it of course when he decided he couldn't do without his car , so I said next week perhaps come without your car, I think I'd won him over by the end but, it was a bit hairy.
Mum
Especially as the childminder hadn't seen what had happened, so she didn't realize why he was carrying on like he was, made the whole thing a little bit tricky, can I give you this?
It hasn't
 

Rosemary came up and said she really enjoyed last night, so, that's something.
I'm not sure it was that brilliant but ha, ha, and it's to change that law

Where?
Remember your dad putting in a big huge something or other which we never did find out what it was, and it's an ugly little specimen
I could see there's a gap there now so
Oh no, no, you're thinking of something else, that was that other pathetic little shrub
Oh
that never did anything, that we inherited, and when we moved all that stuff that was on there, all that junk, erm, when we first moved, I thought it might flourish when it sorted it, but it's kind of spindly so, that's gone, no, no, another bush, over this side
Can't see it
same time as you planted the erm, erm, what do you call it with the butterflies all go on?
Buddleia, same time as you planted the Buddleia, you planted this other thing, we don't quite know what it is against the fence, and it kept sticking out when we played ball, do you remember?
It was too big for the  border, I really wanted little flowers and prettiness down there really instead 
Yeah 
of a little bush
yeah
and I moved it 
It's a record 
Record, what is it?
and I moved it over to that corner there, where nothing else grows
I see.

Oh dear
It probably will die a death, you could hardly ever

highly disgusted 
Who would have children?
What were you doing down?
Quite fond on them didn't we?

Mum, some more water
Have you found a cloth, Christopher did you find a cloth?
Aaagh
Stop
Ah, daddy what on earth did you let him do that for dear?
Cos you thought he could do it, you were wrong.

Or five
or five, or six, or seven somebody will do it 
I've got some water 
Timothy too much 
Yeah, before Tim tipped it all over the mat and all over the

It's only
 

Do have this business chap staying all of Sunday or what do you think?
I don't know, I mean we can either take him up to 
right
or if he wants to
cos it won't be a long evening service will it?
No
whoever, which one of us is there decides to, of course if he decides this after the service you can't stay there very long.
Right, so it doesn't matter
So, whoever takes me, you know
that's probably just as well, so it's on, a couple of hours onto the service really isn't it?
Say you'll be back by half nine  ten
By then we'll know where to go
True, we hope  
I think it's on the A ten, erm
Have you looked it up then?
I, no,
 

Mm, quite exciting isn't it, I mean, well  are you excited by it dear, you seem like you're excited?
It is certainly different
and we can just poddle him along to everything we do, just, I mean it's, you know we can do things in the garden, we can do things round the house  we don't have to lay out anything special do we?
Well I expect
just because we're special type of thing, it'll be OK cos he will be able to enjoy just being with us  or not, as the case may be 
family, yeah  and the children I expect that'll be interesting for them, cos I quite imagine he would of meet many English children knocking around really, cos the situation is he went
Yeah
as many, and they're lots of fun, but, you know  and no doubt aunty will get fascinated by
yeah
and they get
  

there's too much
Yeah 
but, it was a pity he was able to speak on the telephone, so 
Well
people keep telling me about them and I don't seem to write them down, I probably
so I
Oh yeah
 

When
 

Mm, sorted out for April the fifteenth  this erm Information Technology Course 
 

Can I keep that writing
   

Two days
Joe, that's handy
I can
The er
David and
socks, he'll be wearing today and the balls
in the garden
I think we'll put some of that away, do you?
No.
going to have Weetabix as well?
Yeah.
she'll never manage all that.
in that case you can't cope all all that.
So we'll put some of that in there.
There you are.
Sir.
Woops.
Can I have some more milk?
Can I have some 
Where's your bib Tim?
I'm too tired 
breakfast  
Sit on bottom, please.
Don't 
When I'm drinking 
no.
my milk.
Pardon?
When I'm drinking 
There isn't any in there yet.
We're waiting for you to sit down properly then we'll start giving you things like milk.
Cos it starts going all over the place.
Come on.
Timothy.
There.
Ooh.
I drink that  
I shall have your guts for garters one day.
Oh, good job I don't wear glasses isn't it?
going to be recorded  everything.
Funny expression isn't it, that one?
Please may I have some tea?
Certainly my dear.
Thank you.
So what's on the agenda for you today then dear?
Work work and more work.
Oh.
suppose Julia will be there.
boss  
Suppose the what, sorry?
Don't suppose Julia will be there.
My boss is getting to the position where he wants lots of information from me.
Last night, before I came home  he dragged me into his office to  work out how much money  we spend  Pontypool  delivering parts to Solihull.
And do you know?
No, so you had to sit and work it out.
We had, we had to work it out.
Yeah.
I sat with a price list.
He sat with a calculator.
 

He only did that simply because he gets asked questions.
Mm.
Thing I don't approve of is the fact that  when I ask questions
You don't get 
that he needs and he needs to speak to his boss, he doesn't get answers from his boss.
But when his boss chases him for, you know  information or whatever you know .
I only got four sultanas 
information.
today.
It's stopped has it?
Four sultanas today.
Oh dear.
There's lots of Alpen in here but not very many sultanas.
Really?
They're probably all at the bottom.
What?
They are probably all at the bottom.
You say they're always at the top.
Actually they do tend to be, don't they?
They tend to be at the top and then there's sort of little bits and pieces go at the bottom.
So perhaps you'd had it.
Perhaps you won't get any sultanas now.
Why?
Till the end of the Alpen.
I don't know.
I'm just guessing.
I'm afraid the toast wasn't very square shaped.
Somebody must have sat on the loaf or something.
Probably squashed it on the way home from Tesco's.
you squash it.
Then  
Well it did get squashed.
Did you see?
What's happened to the loaf?
Somebody must have sat on it, or pulled it or   
if you do that 
I  one.
No.
You'll find your sandwiches at work will be a little, your sandwiches at school will be a little bit squashed.
 
Well he works.
He works at school.
What?
Daddy told, said when your sandwiches are at work.
You know what I meant.
He meant at school.
But then he said you do work at school so it's alright.
Course he does.
Works very hard.
Oh, it's a big fat one, this.
Be careful   stop.
You're having all of it .
And I had to spend a whole hour in a meeting not not an hour, two and a half hours in a 
I still haven't got very little much 
meeting with the French yesterday with  
 
To listen to the French to say non.
You know 
 
the French say non.
Except they didn't quite say non, one word.
And I haven't.
They said it in a round about way for two and a half hours.
Look at mine.
Look at mine .
We knew they were coming to say non.
That's why the meeting had been arranged.
They didn't need to take two and a half hours over it.
Look at mine.
I didn't have any.
 
And look at mine, I've finished.
I've finished.
 
And me.
  
I need some more milk .
Would everybody stop shrieking.
Hands off the jug please.
Off the jug .
 
What's the problem?
I want a drink please.
There's some for you.
Ugh.
And some for you.
And nobody ask for any more till  toast.
That's a lot.
Ooh, a cat.
Nobody
Go away pussy.
Why?
Go away.
Go away .
It's amazing how a huge c a huge cat like that can get underneath   I've just planted my bulbs  
I saw, I saw a cat.
I saw a cat on the step.
I think all the
Mum.
Mummy.
Mummy .
big green pellet things  
Mum why did you say go away?
Please don't shout at me.
I don't like it.
Why did you say go away when he wasn't on the flowers?
Well, I don't mind him walking across that bit but 
But why did he shout it?
Who, Tim?
Mm.
That might be why he's gone away.
Well that's alright.
We don't mind that.
What did you try to say?
Mum.
Yes.
I saw a black cat on the step.
Did you?
But he went away.
Oh.
Cos I shouted go away then he went.
.
Right.
We're not, not very friendly towards cats here are we?
I don't mind other people's cats in their homes  like erm there's a cat at Holly Cottage isn't there?
Yeah, a black one.
Is that a nice cat, do you stroke it?
Yeah.
Yes it is a nice one mummy.
Remember it do you?
Yeah.
It's the ones that come along and just have to do things in the middle of the garden.
There's a few little flaps mummy 
That's right.
in  Holly Cottage where it can go through and it's a great 
Oh that's nice.
it's very big and they're only small flaps.
Mm.
Cat flap.
Well you can see how cats can squeeze underneath  fences
Mm.
so I'm sure they can squeeze through cat flaps if they need to.
Is he meant to have half of that?
Yes.
I don't want half.
It is raining.
Mummy, it is raining.
I don't want ha I don't want half.
I want a whole.
And what's Tim going to eat?
Nothing.
Could you make another one for him?
 

Make another one for him dad.
Make another one for him.
No.
 

doesn't it?
What's that?
The amount of toast consumed.
off colour day wasn't it?
Whenever it was.
How's your throat today?
Much better today.
I think it suddenly improved.
I would advise  Tarazets if you want to  try and get rid of it.
It's definitely worked for me.
Suck Tarazets if .
Think I need, think I need some Tarazets.
My throat's hurting.
Your throat's hurting is it?
Oh.
Poor Tim.
Mine is as well mum.

So's mine.
Ha!
Think all of us want one..
Mine's on it's way out.
 
Mum's on it's mum's is on it's way out.
If I have it  o one first, then you, then him then 
I'm not bothering today cos I think mine is  nearly better now.
It can get better by itself now.
One for me, then  Christopher, then dad.
Then we 
Well  it went Tim  no it went mummy   
No.
Mummy.
Mummy's not having any .
But she always, she used to have one.
So she had it first, you had it second  erm  daddy had it  third and I had it fourth.
You've got  on your jumper.
Mm.
I've just seen that too Tim.
Oh.
How did that happen?
I don't know.
Perhaps your arm  
Think you  your jumper.
I didn't.
Where is my marmalade?
Marmite.
If you said  please may I have the marmalade it might arrive.
Why has it got a mar and E on the end?
 
Cos otherwise it would be marmit.
See, marmit  I it's marmite.
Mum 
Where's the marmalade?
Right in front of you.
Where?
Oh!
Here's the marmalade.
 
He didn't ask for it.
He just said where is it.
Just say, please can I have it.
say please may I have the marmalade.
Peas.
He didn't.
I said peas.
Not please, I didn't say please.
Oh.
Well say thank you when you get it.
Thank you.
I said 
That's it.
peas  instead of please.
I said peas
Timothy, how did you manage to get on your knees again?
What?
Easy.
Easy-peasy.
He must have got a spring.
Automatic spring in there.
What?
What?
You're supposed to sit down to eat Tim.
Remember?
I've  finished.
There.
Right.
Thank you.
Is he sitting down mum?
No he's kneeling up.

Yes he is kneeling up.
So, this afternoon
Mhm.
When we go to the dentist.
we gather at the dentist at four o'clock.
Shall we gather at the dentist .
You'll get there just before.
Erm  will you be able to take some money?
A chequebook, I'll take.
Right.
Cos it costs so much now.
I think they put the rate up didn't they?
Recently.
Did they?
Yeah.
So how much is it now, for children?
It's Ruth's birthday today.
It is Ruth's birthday today.
That's very clever.
How do you know that?
Mm mm.
He just remembers these things.
Mm.
It's not your birthday  
No, Ruth's.
No not mine.
Ruth's 
Your cousin.
Cousin Ruth.
Remember Ruth?
Went to stay with them and  Ruth came to read to you in the morning.
Oh no, Ann came to read to you in the mornings didn't she?
Ruth wasn't with us in the mornings.
Ruth.
Yes, you remember.
Ruth  and Ann 
 
and Uncle David and Auntie Gwen.
Do you remember them?
We went to stay in their house one weekend.
And we went with them to the zoo.
Do you remember?
Oh yes.
Remember going to the zoo?
We went on a little steam train as well.
And you and me nearly  nearly didn't get on the train.
Do you remember the train?
They were all waiting for us.
We had to run quick.
Why?
I can't remember what we were doing.
Probably weeing up a tree somewhere.
because, think the train nearly went.
Yes.
Everybody else was sitting on the train.
We had to run quick to get on it.
Because, because the little train nearly without us.
Mm.
Did nearly go without us.
If it went without you
We'd have to catch the next one.
Mm.
That's right.
Cos there's only one train.
It was going round and round wasn't it?
Mm.
We'd have to wait for the next one then.
Mm.
So are we all being  examined today?
We are, this is a family trip.
Right.
Because  said, are the children coming for a check up too.
Well, I have some Marmite.
Cos otherwise it's silly if we go 
Yeah.
and then they go and  they never know where they are.
Can I have some Marmite on this?
Are the children supposed to go every six months?
Something like that.
Well that's okay.
So it ought to work out twelve and a six month  
Mum.
so that we go every twelve and they go every six.
Can you chop it?
But somehow or another it got out of sequence.
 
Can you chop No  chop it.
Oh chop, sorry.
I'm not listening to you am I?
Presuming that our dentist still wants to do National Health Service work.
Cos most of them are threatening to give up aren't they?
Are they?
No.
Yeah.
And do what?
Private?
Mum  mum .
Private work.
Cos they say they don't get paid enough money for the N H S.
So people like, except the children you mean?
No.
For everybody.
The vast majority of dentists have threatened to  
Well how come when we're paying so much?
Do you want 
Well because you'd have to pay even more  if you did it privately.
My throat hurts.
Oh I see.
Is it dear?
Do you want two ?
Yeah.
Mm mm mm.
A  please.
 
A messy .
A ?
What's a ?
I can't wear my new shoes this morning can I?
Why not?
Oh no you can't cos it's school.
You can wear them when you get home.
Mm.
And walk to the dentist.
What?
And walk to the dentist in your new shoes.
And at the dentists.
Yeah.
Well you don't take your shoes off at the dentists.
He doesn't look at your feet, he only looks at your teeth.
He'll get a shock when he sees your teeth won't he?
Four of them have changed since you last came.
Is it today?
Is it today?
Mhm.
Oh.
It feels funny when she  you do it.
Mum.
Yeah.
Is it  are you going to be checked?
Yes.
Mummy and daddy and you two.
We're all going, family trip.
And me?
Mhm.
At the bed time?
Yes and you.
At bed time?
No, four o'clock it is.
I'm gonna look at my teeth.
 
It's a little, it's a little ploy to get daddy home early.
What?
gonna look at my teeth?
Daddy'll have to come home a bit early to have it done.
gonna look at my teeth?
Yes.
Will you let him?
Yes?
Will you sit on the chair, open your mouth, let him stick a mirror in?
Aah.
 

Stick a mirror in?
We don't 
I seem to remember last time you got two stickers didn't you, cos you had super clean teeth?
I bet you only get one sticker this time.
Why?
You think I'm gonna get two?
You'd have to clean them out very  did that.
I think you were a bit lucky to get two stickers.
I would have thought one sticker would be sufficient really.
It was when Mrs  was there then wasn't it mummy?
Was it?
Mrs  was there.
Mm probably.
Mm.
It was.
Oh you went to school didn't you?
There was a dentist came to school, remember?
And we had a letter home saying something about you need to go to the local dentist or something for treatment.
Poss no possible treatment.
And I think it was cos of the wobbly front tooth when  you bent it back when you fell over my foot.
But next time it won't 
So we didn't bother going because we were regularly going anyway.
What?
You didn't bother going cos we 
No.
were regularly going?
Yeah.
Well I didn't see much point 
What does regularly mean?
Regularly means that we go in anyway t every six months you go and have your teeth checked to see if they're okay.
Every six
So just when some  some bod comes to school and  opens your mouth and says ooh, this looks interesting, there's not much point because  our own dentist knows about it.
So you don't really need to be checked at school?
No I wouldn't have thought so.
But some people don't go to the dentist regularly, so they need to be checked at school.
People like Michelle probably never set eyes on a dentist normally.
It's probably a good thing for a dentist to have a look at her teeth and see what needs doing.
Because her mum  and her mum doesn't ?
Mm probably.
They've never been?
Probably not.
Why?
We have.
I'm just guessing.
We've been, yeah.
But not everybody does.
Well not everybody likes dentists and they think that something 
Well well we 
awful's gonna happen to them.
They're wrong 
What?
cos it's nice isn't it, at the dentist?
Think everyone goes.
To the dentist.
Well everybody  ought to go to the dentist if they want to keep their teeth nice and healthy.
But not everybody does cos some people get frightened of dentists and they think ooh I don't want to go there.
But that's silly cos there's nothing to be frightened of is there?
It's nice at the dentist.
No no-one can get frightened.
Mm.
But they won't get stickers will they?
True.
They won't get stickers dad.
If they go 
got toothbrushes to give you   but the    
Mm.
can't see that can you?
No, you can't see that.
That's why you need a mirror.
Could I have one of those ?
Can you have what?
Have one of those things.
What things?
Those pink things that af after we had our lunch.
Pink things?
Yeah.
Er those things in that bottle.
Oh I know what you mean.
For your throat?
Yeah.
Yes you can do, just wipe your hands first.
Why?
Well he's got his sore throat here.
I've got a sore throat too.
Have you?
Right.
And you.
You can have one each.
Where are they?
In the kitchen.
Would I spot it?
I don't know.
Think I'm going to get them because  I  I  
No Tim.
Mummy has to get those.
It says on the bottle, only mummies touch medicines.
Well no, not quite but  
It doesn't really.
One for you.
One for Tim.
One for you, daddy, would you like one of these .
One  yeah cos he's allowed .
He's allowed to have one.
Yeah.
I I I've got one.
Have you?
Yes.
I've got one.
Look.
Yes.
Already had these before daddy.
And me.
 
I I I I had another piece.
 
Right.
Are we gonna have a song?
I shouldn't be here.
I'm late.
It's got to be very very quick.
Very very quick.
And I want to watch the telly.
Well hold on cos  
Right.
Can we have a prayer?
Can I have be bold?
Right.
Yes.
After the prayer.
just gonna have a prayer, right.
.
Heavenly father 
Be bold.
we pray that  you'll be with us today.
That you'll help us as we go out.
Go to  nursery and school and work  and do different things.
Pray that  we'll listen to you.
To help us to be friends to those we meet.
That you'll look after and keep us safe until the end of the day.
Amen.
Amen.

Christopher.

Your clothes are upstairs on the chair.
Mum .

In we go.
In we go.
Shall we close the door?
You knit you knit Tim's jumpers don't you Dot?
Er sometimes, it depends.
 
Granny and
Ah they're not all granny's.
Some are granny's and some 
Oh I was just  oh what a lovely jumper.
Did you knit it?
And she said no, grandma knitted it.
Do you remember the teddybear one?
The trouble is he's wearing it out for Christopher so you won't see the new one.
you mean you didn't knit these?
I didn't knit this one, but I did knit the teddy one.
Remember the teddy one?
No.
Cos Tim said you knitted one.
He wears the, mm 
I said did nanny and he said no mummy knitted it.
No I do, I do knit.
Not often, but I knit.
Trouble is granny does it and she's got loads of time.
She sits there and does them twice as fast as me.
I th what I like doing, I like the pictures.
Yes.
So I don't mind doing the pictures.
If she'd do the sleeves and the back for me  I'd be very grateful .
Yeah.
Whereas she can't stand doing the pictures cos it takes her too much time.
It's like doing tapestry.
Yeah.
I like the picture bits  
And then there's all this, yeah green or something at the back.
So when I did one I sort of 
Ooh 
rationed myself.
A few rows of green 
good gracious!
and then I could do a flower.
It's just ridiculous   
Good for the good for the soul.
Let's open you up.
Why is it you can't do this, eh?
Cos you're on strike when we come to nursery and you like to feel that way.
Look at this owl sitting looking at us.
Sweet isn't it?
Little bit battered now.
It's got a lot of bits missing.
Oh well, well he still looks very sweet to those of us who are not familiar with him.
 
Oh yeah.
Well no but 
She keeps apologizing for him.
perfectly normal  
 
I think she thinks he ought to be totally angelic, you know  
They're not though are they, really?
Oh yeah.
No we insist upon being normal children .
Oh.
Yeah, what are we gonna do today then?
This side or the other side?
Do you want to go and see what's going on in the sitting room?
Or are you going to come in here?
Ooh, hello Bubble.
Where are you gonna be?
Do you want to go this way and have a look?
Shall I give you a kiss and say goodbye?
Oh no you don't like kisses at the moment do you?
Oh dear, don't you like sloppy kisses?
Sometimes he does, just before he goes to bed but you have to put them in just the right place.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning ladies.
Are you going?
They're all in here, the other people.
No?
What are you gonna do?
Let me down, let me down mum, let me down.
Ooh gosh it's cold this morning.
Alright Tim?
Sort of.
We don't quite know what to do with ourselves at the moment.
Morning Rebecca, morning Elizabeth.
Morning.
Isn't it cold this morning?
I'm warm.
Oh I'm warm too.
Or are you sickening for something?
I think  in fact it was too warm but I still thought it was cold.
And it was so warm  today.
The flu.
Definitely the flu.
Mm my husband's in bed.
 
Oh well there we are.
So I probably am coming down with .

Could be Bubble pussycats couldn't it Tim?
Morning Cath.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Morning.
Everybody's arriving aren't they Tim?
Shall we go in there and help find a jigsaw or something?
Cos you like doing that don't you?
seems to be our general  general start in life.
Ooh this looks nice.
Oh that's a nice one isn't it?
Chains and .
Right, I'll see you later then.
Can I blow you one today  or not?
Bye.
Can't kiss him .
My other one's kissy so it's alright.
He's huggy this one, not kissy.
He doesn't like wet sloppy kisses, he thinks it's silly.
do any sloppy kisses?
No only one.
sloppy kisses and this  this little girl we had sloppy kisses  ooh that's mucky, that's just for babies.
So we don't have any sloppy kisses  can't sleep at night.
You haven't lent it to him have you?
Oh.
Then in the end she decides it's alright.
Oh.
She can bear 
I wouldn't like to say what they're doing.
Look at that one, he's on his back.
Is one of them a drake then?
Must be.
Yes.
Which one's which?
Well he's got a little .
That one's on the other's back.
Oh I say!
Oh they might  they're coming for a swim now look.
Ooh just gonna have a drink.
Are you going to pop in there, go for a swim?
Come on.
In there.
In.
Going to have a swim?
Oh  yes, there we go.
Yes, he's doing what you told him.
 

Nice isn't it?
Come on.
Let's get in the car then.
Lovely aren't they?
Come on then.
No.
Think these ones gonna go in.
Well I think we'd better leave them just to do what they like, cos I expect Gwen wants to get on with her dinner now.
Yeah, and I want to go and get 
We need to go home.
I'm going to get some lunch at grandma's.
Going to grandma's house for our lunch now.
Have you had a nice morning at nursery?
Mind that road.
Wait at the gates.
Stop there, wait.
Good boy.
Have you shown grandma your new shoes?
No.
Oh.
Mind, cos there's a car coming Tim.
Played in the sand.
Played in the sand?
Was that with good James or naughty James?
Naughty James.
Ooh.
Was naughty James good?
So there we are.
Mm.
And they use the whole of the house, you know there's the downstairs, that little room that you saw.
Yeah.
That's known as the nursery room.
Yeah.
And then they go in all the rest  
Then they go in all the rest of the  well just the downstairs.
Downstairs, mm.
So they can go, they have a story time in the sitting room, you know with a
That's nice that's  
They play on the floor with a
Yeah.
trucks and everything.
It's friendly isn't it?
Mm.
You know what I mean?
It's not institutionalized.
Well it's better  isn't it?
Well I think so.
And there's nobody shrieking at them and there's only twelve of them there and  you know, nobody's getting cross with anybody.
Well I mean I suppose they do when they  do something stupid.
But there's not  there's not like 
 
Yeah.
That's right.
Which is also why I feel that he ought to go to  Ironcrest as well.
Because otherwise school will become a little 
Mm.
horrendous won't it?
And if he goes to  
Specially  Woodrow 
just for mornings only  he'll be able to stick up for himself and that won't he?
Yeah.
But it's sad really because I mean  does all sorts of things  with them which
He won't get when he goes, mm 
But then Christopher survived didn't he?
Yeah.
