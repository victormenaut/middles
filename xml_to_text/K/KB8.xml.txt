Which is the right one for
The pink one's a dish cloth.
The blue one's the one I wipe up  small stains off the floor.
Right.
I wonder how Bryony is?
What?
I said, I wonder how Bryony is?
And she wasn't very well yesterday.
Every time she got a bump  or knock off one of the others she was crying  instead of clouting them back.
It must have been Richard, I do I don't think  Richard's very, he 
Sorry, what d'ya say Richard was?
I said I don't  well stop running the tap.
I say, I don't think Richard's  very well either.
Cos he cried more than usual.
I wonder what time, the other night, Trevor had with them on his own?
What do you think of granny Jean offering it  offering again to get Martin  from school to save Trevor walking him home?
Well it's  well perhaps there's nothing in it for him.
I don't know.
I like her.
Mm?
I like her.
Can I just ri rinse my thingy.
And get my  in.
Ooh!
I've got hand cream on my hands.
That  spurtle was used as a  I can't 
A  
remember what Richard was using it as yesterday.
Well he was poking me  in the groin.
What are we going to do about these  tiles for the step
I dunno.
to cover this  little hole in our path?
I should hate to think what must be down there now.
Tt.
Oh!
Well leave it cos it's  it's
Well I told you that Fenwicks had  and they were cheaper than
Cheaper?
Fenwicks?
but cheaper than  what they call it?
The place in, the old place.
Yes.
They were cheaper.
I got the price for you.
Cheaper than the do-it-yourself shop up Brady's?
They were both
But when, can we get through to Newcastle?
Well I  well I'll have a week's holiday after Easter and I've gotta go  unless we go to .
And I've got a  an all day meeting, I've arranged it on the  Tuesday  that's if we're being presented to .
Which Tuesday?
After they break up?
That's right.
Which is, this, next Friday.
Yes.
So I hope to sort it out  the Lenten appeal  well
The what?
The Len 
Lin 
the Lenten's appeal at the schools  that Mrs  was supposed to  let Miss  know  so she could get it off to the parents to get the money back  so that they bought the scanner.
See, you didn't tell me about that.
I did tell you.
You didn't.
All you told me  go on  ah  only this one's
Miss  wanted to 
all you told me was that Miss  was retiring.
But, I haven't to tell anyone.
Which I haven't done.
Which I don't intend to do.
At the beginning of Lent Miss  approached me
Yes.
to see  what she should do about the Lenten appeal
Aha.
as she always does.
Since I said, why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was  plenty of children's things local?
Yes.
So I asked if we wanted anything?
And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital?
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds.
Oh you mean a bed?
Well
Tt!
D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be 
Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that  we were
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
But why's 
She di na she just said a bed, and so 
Yes.
I told her there were special beds that we have  are very useful, in fact  very necessary in some, some cases, and are  painfully short of them.
Aha.
And a Nimbas bed  costs two thousand pound.
And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of, which costs a lot more.
Mhm.
Something like, five thousand.
But I can't remember the name.
Anyway, I said I'd  make enquiries as to what a is wanted.
And I said there's a, there's a new children's ward  will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital  perhaps they would like something.
I saw Mrs , and Mrs  said  they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal.
Yeah.
But, also they're going to  have a  an obstetric adult patient's department  at the College Hospital for the very first time.
A what?
A
An obstetric outpatients
Yeah.
Yeah.
and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children  with mothers then  so they would like perhaps a play facility there.
And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the
or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty
Yes.
there's very limited facilities for children to play.
So  but I also coaxed Mrs  about  the Wandsbergh .
Anyway, she  wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible  and  because there was an arts appeal and  for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things.
So  I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be  she thought that that would be the best idea.
Not the children's things at the  Cottage Hospital.
I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital  and  the children from  will be invited to the hospital for that day  that week, sorry.
It's gonna be a week  .
So she wanted to know what date it is.
So I, I asked Mrs  to  but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details.
And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all.
And that she was going on Wednesday, I think.
Up she went  you know
Hold on.
Which one was going to see which 
It's 
one?
Mrs  was going to see Miss 
Was going to see Miss 
.
Oh.
I see.
I didn't know which one.
But I give them a  so then I saw Mrs  on Tuesday    when I was at Ashington.
And she came up with all sorts of things that  she would like for the  the new Wandsbergh development.
But on a  but there's nothing ready of course, so th there's, there's a  giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards  and it's a giant one  it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of  things in, in the  in the courtyard that make up the  the time.
So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the  of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth.
This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got 
Hold on.
Wha how  where is it going to be seen from?
I presume it's seen from the wards  that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard.
There's also erm  a play area for the  the children's ward  there's also some murals on the  the walls, various artistic murals.
And, of course, they've got this grant from  Artcan  for six thousand pound  for a  proggie mat exhibition.
A six thousand pound grant for a  proggie mat 
Well
exhibition?
well over, over a period, it's  and other things too but they sa they said that murals and  proggie mats are involved in it.
And various other art things.
But also,th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden  up.
But that's a, apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here  to  the Wandsbergh Hospital.
But then I thought, perhaps  if  that 
I can't see the education committee  with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here 
Well they won't 
to go Ashington Hospital to do a 
they won't so the they, they 
garden.
the, the, the  education committee and the school governors have no money at all 
No.
to pay for that.
I would expect 
But then 
that's a very low priority.
well it isn't even a priority, it is nothing.
They won't get the money.
Th they won't pay for them to go swimming 
Well I don't
they've gotta walk to go swimming.
But, I thought that  now that the M S has acquired that bus  and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time  and it's a twenty nine seater bus.
I mean, the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in  but  in between times it's twenty seats you see.
And then you'll need a P S V 
Well 
licence.
but, but that's, that's  that's easily remedied if you could get a er  a driving licence holder  to take them  oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents  or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing.
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss  about all these sort of things.
But I did also say  to Mrs , that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that it might be better to discuss it with them  after I've discussed with Miss .
I only know one person  I only know one bus driver with children.
There's ambulance drivers.
And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School.
Er  this  letter from the Multiple Sclerosis
Yes.
Says any 
that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're not 
To sixteen.
you're not reducing the size of the bus.
Well I think that's crazy.
And someone who's been just used to driving a car  are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
Well
tuition?
Well I, I 
Whether it's got  whether it's got sixteen people in it or  twenty nine 
Well er 
it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
I drive the minibus at the hospital
I know.
which only takes four wheelchairs  and of course there's the drivers of, of the minibus things that bring them.
I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just  
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition 
No.
and just drive 
But, but 
it?
but I query as well, whether just because you reduce the number of spa passengers in it  that you, you, you don't need  a P S V licence, or the equivalent isn't a P S V licence but it's, it's
Oh you do,the they've looked into that.
But it sounds  doubtful to me.
But anyway  there's the insurance point of view.
But anyway, any  I mean  that's the easy, and I mean, if, if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving  before they take passengers out.
I mean, I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
Yeah.
I mean I  I, I  I  drove the minibus   with only somebody in with me  before I drove out with people in it.
Didn't you da drive Dancy Dags?
Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that.
Yeah, but  yo you drove that one
I drove it to Ashington and  
Mm.
You drive her to Ashington in it.
Yes.
Erm  do you think I should throw these roses out?
They're 
Aha.
dead aren't they?
I'm afraid so.
It's a shame.
Well they'll be forced for last Sunday.
Pardon?
They will be forced for last Sunday, and that was 
Oh I know.
the air wasn't it?
I know, but they were dead by about Tuesday.
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
So  what a shame.
Never mind.
Right, I'll put my make up on.
Have you decided where you want this umbrella tree?
Er er
You need a saucer at the bottom.
But they're never the right size for that it wants .
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one.
Ah but that's in it  you can put one in that 
Well 
plant pot, that's a different matter altogether.
Jus just leave it there for now.
Erm  I'm going to put my make up on  and think what I need from the shops.
Right.
It's ten o'clock love.
I know.
I'm gonna have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner.
I'll take that upstairs with me.
Ooh!
My head feels a lot better.
It's gotta be better.
Oh !
I don't 
That er 
I haven't had a  a headache like this for a
Still it's much more quick.
I know.
I need some  le er  the, I wanted a carton of live yoghurt  I don't think the live yoghurt I used was any good because, for a start  it was  fruit flavoured, no it wasn't, it was natural, but it said mild flavoured
Mm.
and I don't think it was the proper  like the Greek style, real live yoghurt that would have 
Mm mm.
started all the fungus growing on it.
It is beginning to look like a proper stone cup though.
And they're saying that  er  okay, I'll go and get ready.
So do you want the yoghurt, yoghurt before we go to the  ?
I don't think it matters, but  if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
And if so does, does 
I've got the 
the,it's outside all the time anyway .
I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still.
I got it standing on that brick  so it would drain.
I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
Some of the  erm  stems on it look as if the  not mouldy but they're, they're sort of 
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put 
green.
another one in.
Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out aren't they?
I know.
I would have thought the tulip  that went in the er coal scuttle  the tulips in the cauldron  I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely.
I know.
They just straightened 
They were 
up.
just  grown up again.
And those  forget-me-nots  that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming out with erm  tiny  pinkey, purpley flowers.
I know.
If they're blue, so am I!
And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up, one that's on it own, that one with the
The wha 
on the tub.
Is there one in the tub?
No.
Yes.
Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one.
Mhm.
I like the other best as well, it's the peach one.
When are you going to prune them?
Well, when I plant that other one where you want it planted, that's
I wonder when er  John  's going to have the erm
Wheelbarrow ready.
Yes.
Oh!
Said in yesterday's paper  that someone had had a wheelbarrow  valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden  and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.
Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible.
So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds.
Mm.
Cos it didn't, it didn't say  a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow.
Well those er  four tapes 
So we'll have to get it
those four tapes, incidentally, I saw, you know the  compil the Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and  Tchaikovsky, I saw them for fifteen pound.
What four tapes?
The four, not tapes, compact discs.
The set of four that we sent  so they were fifteen pound in  there.
That who sent to you?
That Shirley and  Gareth sent me for Christmas.
Ah ah!
The 
I wish you'd think of something you would like for your birthday.
I told you, I want a  I would like a fiddle.

You have never sat down  and read 
You have to rewind it, it's a 
all the 
problem.
read all the instructions, the same with the video camera.
You haven't even watched the tape.
When have I had an opportunity to watch the tape?
Oh!
You must have been able to squeeze half an hour sometime or other.
Anyway, I'm going to get ready or we'll never get the shopping done before you go to work.

Oranges.

I had the Rotaract, erm, they  said they'd probably be, offered, er er, one of these castle things  er jumping castles from  .
Oh!
Did you see those on the news yesterday?
Aye.
I see, yeah.
They can cause a lot of  apparently.
Adults and children
Yeah.
injuries.
I fell off one the week before last  at the soft play  but  it wasn't blown up  quite enough.
Oh I see.
And, as I ste 
Well there's no carpet, he said there's just
Well, there was 
 
there's a great  you know the big heavy  erm, foam thing, but it kept slipping away.
All the morning I kept pushing it back again.
Aye.
Yeah.
They 
Er 
couldn't tell me I suppose.
and it a it had happened to of  slipped away at that time  and I went to step off, and, with it not being blown up properly  that's how  it just flattened and I went off sid I've still got a big bruise on my left knee!
Well erm  the only 
So I, I do not jump on any more.
the only trouble with that sort of thing i is, again if you ever get any wet on it because
Mm.
Mm mm.
Oh well.
And, there's certainly some 
So the mayor's taking out the oranges?
And er 
So they've got, they've got it back now, so it's got nothing to do with us?
No, I don't suppose, thank you.
Er
Do you work?
No.
Mm.
No, erm  basically er  I think for the  anyhow Trevor will be coming in, so we'll, we just st try and stay a little more to see what happens at the end.
But erm
See they handed it over to us and, but they didn't wanna  you know, it was very  when, what they call them?
Erm
It was Temple wasn't it,la last year?
Aye, Temple was    but it, it was a good job because we had no oranges  and they had to go and break in.
It's alright now .
Yeah.
Was that the year the oranges were horrible?
Er
I've 
Yeah.
they were Seville oranges, I'm sure they were 
Well they've, they've been nice.
Seville oranges.
Aye.
They've never been really nice.
Yeah.
Well I don't know where they're getting them from, but I mean, that's what they say.
Well that year 
And they've got Round Table laid on to help and they want help from the  from us.
So they want us to go around at  half past one  or the two of them can start cos we've got an addition .
Well, it worked.
Er, I'm just  wondered, you know,wi with  because they came to expect it and we, we didn't know.
And, they'd handed it over to us and then  obviously they wanted it back, but then
Well, I think it's like everything else, I think that  er, with, with Lawrence being off they're just sort of meeting everything as a crisis and getting, getting
Well if you're at work 
Yo you see as well to go with what you call them?
Er,
  
he, he
Didn't
he didn't want anything to do with it you see.
That's where  and he's not from , he's not from this end so  had  er no real interest  for him I don't think.
If you're at work Dorothy could go  If I help, I'll help with Trevor with his triplets.
Well you can go and get their oranges and the
Yes, but it's, he, he  couldn't possibly push that buggy
around that field.
But it isn't in the fields though.
it's up beside the 
It's, it's 
it, it's Carlisle Park.
Oh!
That's 
Because 
better.
because the, the, the pa the er
Oh!
Because of that lea 
The Easter Field is, is 
leaking 
It's got a .
Yes.
So it can't be used.
Right.
But I presume that  we do turn out if we do it right in the middle.
Well in actual fact, people who turned out were Isobel  and me, and er  what they call him?
Er, one who goes on?
Er, from Lonsdene?
Er  Fred ?
Fred  
No.
Fred .
No, Jack's not very well.
Well I helped you  one year 
Oh yes.

Yes.
there was only  you and somebody else.
Well the year I was chairman.
Th the, er  the year I was wi I was chairman, we were both there.
There was one child came up about seventeen times 
Oh yes!
I think.
Erm, down, it was down here remember?
I know.
That was the year the oranges were horrible, maybe his mother was making marmalade.
The only thing about er is that the Rotaract one tentatively mentioned about the .
Well that's it.
I mean,th tha when we took it over we, we got that, cos people said well, you know, just dishing out the oranges wasn't  there should be something organized so Rotaract said they would do  we said we would give the money towards the prizes.
So that they wouldn't hate us.
Well when er, the, the, the, there's two words, the charter, and what's the other word?
There's two things to do with .
Food and jar, that's right.
Yeah.
Well well Barlen, Barlen.
Barlen  and .
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't say that properly.
Those words aren't used where  I come from .
And er, er 
Mind, I use words that Jim doesn't.
the, the Rotaract er  presents this year that they're  towards, so he's been  quite pleased.
Mhm.
So they'll, they'll be done.
And Round Table it says, has laid on for the
Well Round Table a er have never, that's the first time then?
We got 
Well it's 
because, cos it's Rotaract who's always
It must be the borough involved with the
Mhm.
But I'm er
But they were keen.
I mean, I, they, they've, they've, they did work didn't they?
With, with the games and things when, when we were there.
Yes.
And it was a reasonable day too
I know all the children.
I mean, we thought it'd rain this year so it's  more 
Yeah.
likely to be a better day then 
And ee, all the kids ended up with a prize didn't they?
Oh, eventually, yes.
I mean,th the 
Yeah they 
they were  that had bigger to ones 
The winners got 
Who supplied those then?
Out of the money that we gave them.
Oh!
The 
Yes.
I see, it was, and that was what Rotaract did?
Yes.
Yes.
They had big eggs, well, you know, sort of the 
Aha.
Smarties type egg so about so big 
 
for the prizes
Ah.
and the others got little Cadbury's 
Ah.
Creme Eggs.
Which remi reminds me, I've got to get some for all they  spare children  before  
Yes.
well 
before they ran out.
It's surprising actually cos th the more, the more  common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a bit pricey.
The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round  and then they run out at Easter.
That's happened, I couldn't get any  one year  I took the triplets to the erm  Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola  and one of them  won a Creme Egg
but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag  and er  it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some  I, I can't remember what we were doing afterwards  so I gave it to his mother, I thought she could share it.
Mind, by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between  those three and their older brother
Yeah.
There's not much of it left.
No, but I could have seen a, there'd be an  almighty tantrums from the other two if Ji er
Aha.
James had had it.
I can imagine.
Mm.
Mm.
Is there anything much for the agenda for a week on Tuesday?
Not a great deal.
I mean, what I'll 
Yeah.
do is  we'll get rid of those couple of things left over
Mhm.
and er  basically, it's, Peter's got the one coming which is er  put the ducks in the river.
Mm.
Er, he's doing the, a, and what I'm er sug suggesting
Aha.
like well  apparently the fella that's done it, for years, and years, for years, for years has had a 
Mhm.
and he's, he's just  ke you know what I mean, I think he's, he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of delay on that.
Mhm.
And it's where that lot meet .
I've been counting them since.
Well how much, I mean 
I read the letter in the paper.
how much was he paying ?
It was summat like er  I dunno, it was summat like five hundred pound a year.
It was quite modest.
Mm.
Er
There were thirteen 
But 
drakes cha er chasing one duck  er, just past the baths along the promenade.
And then we sat  at the far side of the Old Gate bridge  and er  an old lady came along  and said, and she was counting them  but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven  although, in actual fact, by then  th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down.
And a there was a domestic one  in each group  there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one  near Old Gate Bridge.
Did he cull them as well?
Yeah, apparently so.
Yes.
Did he feed them?
Cos there's  there was, there used to be fe feed put down for that as well.
Well, to be honest, it seems to, I  Peter's got the details cos he's been talking to er, the public health clerk.
Mhm.
But it's, it's, it's  it sort a  it's, I think carrying through from the old borough days
That's right.
and, somebody ha erm  nobody really knew a great deal about it, so I think he's been doing some research on that.
That's the one paper that is a bit er  maybe a bit so  but th I'll have to check with the N  R A because of course er, the river
Mm.
er policing is their responsibility.
It is.
They, they've not  they'll not do that.
No.
No.
But I mean,we really, we've gotta make sure that they haven't got any objections.
But of course, in the meanwhile, of course we've had a flood.
Yes.
And it's going to kill most of the 
Yes.
eggs  wash most of the nests away I was thinking yesterday.
It's bloody incredible actually!
We always get extreme .
Well that's, it wasn't a obviously as high as the flood twenty seven years ago.
No.
But was, pretty near.
It was getting near.
But of course the higher standards they've got no protection cos they  didn't want  what was offered.
They didn't want a bank.
Well that's right.
Er none whatsoever.
It was 
 
a raised footpath that was before 
Yeah.
this wasn't it?
Than, than the bridge right round.
Which is what we're doing at, at the Wandsbeck innit?
So we'll put a  we'll put a bank in, very deliberately at the first level
Mhm.
erm  and went right the way through with, it did look, it doesn't look bad at all, it was 
Yeah well  no, it didn't.
I mean, this looks  well there's nothing else they could do here.
It doesn't look il ugly, but I mean it, it  it's not attractive
No.
but it's
but, but, but they've got protection.
But I mean er that one lent itself to that.
That's right.
Yes.
Yes.
It would have been ideal.
But you see now of course, that was when there were River
Yeah.
River Authority days and 
Yeah.
that was quite good.
Erm  it was quite useful er, they  you could get things done, now 
Mm.
now it's nothing.
Well they just  put 
I came along the river path when I came home from shopping.
Sitting in the, the sand, damp sand  under the bridge .
Mm.
You never saw that one that would er  you know the one on the Bedford Road because Bedford Road has a  
Well they  that's right.
I mean 
Yes.
there's nothing can be done, than the 
No.
nothing at all.
Mhm.
Mhm.
But er, ah, you know, it gets up into the garden but I don't think it, it's got anywhere near the house er this time, cos I was up there  on Thursday and I, you could see where it had been, but it was  and I mi I'd have got very worried about er
But you could actually put a bag all the way and tie it into  tie it into er  the  it's the Skillery Bridge that one.
Yes, the Skillery Bridge 
And 
yeah.
you just sort of tied up the 
Well 
Yes, well, that's where we'll have to go from there 
I think.
round  but 
There were wild rumours flying around on Wednesday, I was told
They didn't want to
by several people that the Skillery had gone.
In 
But it hadn't, no.
It survived.
Well Jim, Jim saw the children going back to er  school after swimming
Oh.
over it on Thursday afternoon  but er
But there was a lot of debris up against it, and high up against it!
Yeah.
So they could see how bad 
Was Fold Cottage flooded?
It was bound to be 
It didn't 
Ann.
Bound to be.
I thought they built a wall around it the 
No.
last people who bought it.
Yeah, but even on that you see,yo yo you know,yo you're never really stuck with it  I mean 
No.
, once you're in the clear  you  really it's the silliest in the world to have a little  actually.
Yeah.
Well this , who is  must be related to David , anyway, erm  they bought the house facing the o is it Old Cross, Old Gate bridge  and has spent a lot of money on doing it up,li just over three million  of course the whole of the downstairs was flooded today.
Is that Mrs  's?
Yes, that's right.
The one 
Yeah.
facing her, that's right.
Yes.
Aha.
It's called Aubern House is it?
That's right.
That's right.
It's Aubern, it's bigger than Aubern Place on the left.
No, it's, it's not, it's called something Cottage actually.
Aubern is the one round the corner.
Ah.
Oh!
Aye, she must have lived around the corner  but she was the .
Cos she was only, the only one I'm thi 
The first one I'm sure is something Cottage.
It might be Aubern Cottage but  but the one round the corner  the newer one, not the stone one
Aye.
the stone one 
Cos he used to live in that one..
.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes he did.
Before the .
Ah.
Well Stan was a  he looked like Cliff Michelmore didn't he?
Stan.
The original Stan .
Aye.
And he, and I remember ah, er er, I mean I was only, well I was sort of and he had his feet up on the table, he was smoking a cigarette  and he, and he had a laid back attitude.
Oh yes, definitely.
But we, we got our mortgage from, from the council, you know, obviously 
Aha.
because it's  our  it's, Ann was pregnant then  didn't smo and she didn't smoke so 
And I, I gave up smoking when I was pregnant.
So, do you smoke?
No.
I don't smoke.
Erm, d'ya drink?
Not really.
Erm, have you got any hire purchase goods?
No.
The, the cooker which we were buying quarterly, can't have a mortgage.
It was  it was the 
They say they won't believe that.
The cooker was three pounds a quarter.
He says they won't believe 
And he let
they, you can't have it, I'll put you down as a moderate drinker.
We couldn't afford to drink!
We were destitute in those days 
 
We didn't know at the time, but I wasn't working 
Couldn't have a mortgage.
and we were actually living, living below the poverty line.
If I'd read  erm  i if I'd read properly  all the instructions in the back of the er  book 
Yeah.
I would have got fo erm  free orange juice, free vitamin drops
Yeah.
and free milk for Gareth.
Yeah.
But, Jim was a charge nurse.
Goodness only knows what  staff nurses did then?
Jim was a charge nurse, it never occurred to us that we were living before, below the poverty line.
Yeah.
I mean, er
You probably still are.
 
 
I know we're
Possibly.
no, we're a, we're, we're 
we do we do live on 
we don't live on so much erm 
Ah.
broth and er 
 
we used to have, I used to make big pan of broth  you could get gorgeous bacon bones with plenty bacon on in the Co-op in those days, it were wi it was when they, they did all the boning in the shops and you could go, get good meaty bones and I used to 
 
I used to fill it full of vegetables 
 
and  barley so, and 
Yeah I know.
and split peas.
But er  it was po possibly a healthier diet actually, than we have now.
Aye.
Well of course, this is it, I mean you just 
It was quite fat free anyway.
When you, when you look and you see how people survived  and of course they delivered the   that you, I mean like we had dripping and bread.
Oh yes!
Yes.
That's a real, that's 
Terrible thing isn't it?
Yes.
You read books like erm  Lark Rise to 
Yeah.
Candleford and there they went  breakfast was bread and dripping and 
Mm.
It used to taste nice.
Oh!
I liked it.
I gave my, a
a few years ago when my sons were teenagers  I had some nice dripping and I said, you've never had bread and dripping and I gave them some, I put a bit of salt on, I said, try this, I loved a bit of med bread and dripping when I was  your age.
And they took a mouthful and urgh!
Urgh!
Mm.
And we when  how old were they when we went to Whitley for a holiday?
And I saw some liquorice root  and I said, oh!
Look Jim 
Right.
I haven't seen that for years.
I used to buy that for a ha'penny.
During the war time
a ha'penny for two sticks.
And I got them some of that, urgh urgh!
Mm.
They thought it was horrible.
So there was I walking round Whitley chewing this liquorice root.
Just look as if you were spitting tobacco.
 
I didn't like the locust beans though.
Nah.
But it 
And I loved a pennorth of, a pennorth of  karie lick your finger and dip that in.
Yeah.
I know they call it sherbet now, but it's not the same, it was sort of erm
it's like sugary 
We never saw sweets in those days .
Oh well there was, the sweets were on the rationing and, and they 
Mm.
were they very, very few to get.
Was it two ounces a week we got?
And that was only after the war er in 
Mm.
Scotland anyway.
That's right.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh yes.
I used to get my, my teacakes.
Well I didn't know what bananas were.
I mean, I knew what they looked like from pictures 
Yeah.
but I never
No.
never had a taste.
Just, no, no.
Well I 
I 
I obviously had just before the war but I don't, don't, didn't remember then until afterwards.
I knew what a pineapple 
And oranges.
looked like because we had erm
 

a black leaded, no we had one of these black leaded grates, you know, with 
Aye.
oven at the side 
Ah yeah.
and there was a pineapple on the oven door.
Oh.
Yeah.
The first 
I mean 
oh we, I, I got dried bana we had dried bananas Jim.
Ah, but you were
I was under five.
You were under five.
I wasn't.
And my bro 
I was the youngest, I was just five 
My brother and I got dried bananas 
when war broke out.
and we also got peanut butter because we were under five.
Ah.
But erm
the first bananas I saw, my 
Luxury, is peanut butter !
 
My great aunt had a sho 
Yeah.
They
a fruit shop.
You wouldn't touch the stuff now would you?
.
I like bananas.
Mind you, I bet you don't touch peanut butter then?
Erm  just very occasionally  in the school holidays
erm  at lunchtime I don't have many children at school holidays because  apart from one of them, all of them have one or both parents who are teachers
Aha.
so I have Sally, and, and er, her mum always cooks a meal in the evening so I, I do something like toasted cheese sandwiches or beans on toast or something like that at lunch time, but there was one time when she wanted peanut butter  and, all her brother used to ask, I, her brother doesn't come to me now, he stays at home cos he's going on fifteen, and as he's next door but one anyway, you know if, if anything goes wrong he can come along to me, but all he wanted was my homemade blackcurrant jam, and now he doesn't come any more I've got to actually give him 
Send some round.
I give him the blackcurrant jam, I give Myrene the blackcurrant jam, jam to take home for him.
He loves it!
Yeah, that's right.
I remember you saying.
If you will be industrious.
Mm mm mm.
Oh I like, I qui I quite like making jam.
And it would be absolutely sacrilegious to, to  buy hot cross buns.
Oh well.
Yeah.
Oh do no I
Oh.
No there are certain things that I just couldn't do.
I couldn't buy a Christmas pudding, and I couldn't buy a hot cross bun.
It, I think it's too ingrained in me from my grandmother and my mother.
You know, you made your Christmas puddings, everybody had to have a wish when they  stirred them.
I better see if this dinner's ready.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, you know, talking about the ducks on the river, you know that  elderly, ever so refined lady
Who brought bread to feed 
Yes.
the ducks?
Yes.
Yes well, that's right.
I think she must have been  quite well off some time, had fallen on  really hard times.
I mean, she told me  oh, a couple of years ago that she was eighty.
And, I better get this dinner out.
And erm  she always thought of her husband as daddy.
Mhm.
And her daughter  I think she must have been getting on because  around the time she told me that she was eighty, she happened to mention that her daughter was forty.
She had no grandchildren  
I know, her daughter, er her daughter's not married.
Well I haven't seen her feeding the ducks  for about three or four months.
I wonder if she's died or she's ill?
She's always going to jumble sales.
I know.
All, all her clothes came from jumble sales.
Everything.
She wa she was buying, long after nylon shirts went out of fashion, there we there was a pile of nylon shirts, and she said I'm, I'm just looking to see if this  if these will be suitable for daddy.
I can't remember  er, she gave me the reason why she wanted these for  oh, he, he, he always wears his cuffs out or something.
She was quite pleasant to talk to, I liked listening to her.
I don't think I know her name.
So, I couldn't even ask anyone.
Are you ready for your dinner?
I've made the tea.
I forgot to put those in the freezer.
I think I'll do the bedrooms this afternoon.
Especially Bry Bryony's bedroom.
And those begonias are doing well now.
Which?
Where?
In the front room?
Yes.
How many have grown?
Er 
Sometimes you look at them.
It doesn't matter, you don't need to look.
Get on with your dinner!
You'll be late.
Mm.
There's four in the sitting room, there's one well advanced that's doi doing quite well, there's one upstairs that's just about ready for  er, repotting, and there are  two more that have sprouts on.
Only  
So that's seven out of ten, was it?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
About seven.
Well that's not bad for one ninety nine.
There's erm  I know they'd be, probably be better quality  but there are  nine, I think it is, advertised in  today's paper that say, erm for er eleven ninety nine.
So even, we get  seven for one ninety nine, it's a bargain.
Depends what they flower like though.
I hope they're different colours.
And how long they last.
And if we
Well they go on flowering for quite, you you've got 
No, no, I mean, how long  you put 
Oh yeah, you'll have to le leave the children's.
I know that.
But  if we keep them for the next ten years they're a  a real bargain, if, if, if 
Aha.
they're all no good next year, well  it'll be just a  an ordinary bargain.
I don't think, I dunno  that  I wonder if we should put some gravel under that umb umbrella tree.
Or if it should even be near that radiator.
In Australia, you know they grow into great big huge trees in Australia, Mrs  told me.
Yes.
She said er, Derek  has them in his garden.
Well it's a bit better climate out there.
Well I don't know if it's a better climate, but it's a warmer climate.
Well it must get hotter  than it does in this house for a start!
It is hotter.
I was freezing last night in bed!
And you were snoring.
So were you.
I hardly got any sleep last night, my head was aching so much.
Well every night you do.
Every night.
How can I, it, I was on my side.
Well you still snore, er you snore on your side.
Ouch!
Ooh they're hot!
Have to close your mouth.
It's a wonder you haven't got a sore throat all the time Ann.
How many staff have you got off?
I'm not sure, everyone's off sick.
Mm.
Will you be home late?
I don't think so.
Mm.
Have you checked the television pages?
Is there any wildlife programmes or anything you want me to  oh hold on, I've got it here.

Right.
There's absolutely nothing on  on Saturdays.
I hate being here with  on my own on a Saturday.
Well you should save the programmes you recorded  and watch them on a Saturday.
I haven't recorded any.
Instead of 
Have I?
wanting, get rid of them quickly.
I haven't recorded any.
Can't remember what I was doing.
Might as well watch the wildlife programme.
You didn't record them either.

I'm early Easter Monday instead of being on late.
Why?
Cos somebody wan 
Has someone changed with you?
somebody wants  wants to be late for some reason.
And, if we're not going to Aldershot  it doesn't make any difference.
Well it wouldn't made any difference cos we would have come on the Sunday anyway.
That will be Easter Sunday.
I know.
Do we want to travel on Easter Sunday?
Well the traffic's not big on Easter Sunday.
The traffic would be big on the Monday.
Well if it hadn't been al for all those hours and hours hold ups last time we went down I quite like travelling  overnight.
Especially when you get to the M twenty five.
Are you ready for your pudding?
Oh yes please.
If it stays fine I think I'll put another load of washing in here.
Thank you.
I think I've given myself too much dinner.
And I've got, there was some left if you wanted it by the way?
If forgot.
No thanks.
I cooked too much.
D'ya know that blue wool I got?
That.
Well Dorothy got  er, some to knit something for Bryony  and she actually got too much so if I do run out  if I haven't enough to finish this  er er  vest, T-shirt  summer top, whatever it's called  she'll have some.
Is that one you're knitting for Shirley?
Mm mm.
There should be plenty of that wool for me.
I still have to stitch er, erm  my cardigan up for  Melanie but erm  it was easy to start off the other one while I was  talking to your mother.
Right.
.So were these dumplings okay?
Very nice thank you.
Well they were ma and they were made with vegetarian suet.
Well they  Catherine baked them.
Catherine's were baked not  boiled.
I prefer baked dumplings anyway.
You what?
I've, I would bake dumplings if you liked them.
I prefer them baked.
I like crusty tops on them.
Well with the taste, sooner have them  the hardness of it.
You only had a tiny taste of one.
No it wasn't.
You were pinching somebody else's  I don't know.
The Yorkshire pudding I love.
I don't know.
They were in the middle of the dinner when we got there.
I know.
You'd had yours.
And you grabbed a piece of somebody's dumpling and said, oh I'll have a bite of that.
And you said afterwards you didn't like it.
Well I didn't care much for it.
No.
Well they must be better for you than an animal fat.
Possibly.
With all this  it's a predisposition
They cook just as fluffy
the cholesterol you know 
as with ordinary suet.
that's, that's the problem.
What?
It's the predisposition to  heart attacks, it doesn't matter how well you sa stick to your diet what have you  cholesterol 
You can have a, a cholesterol test, you know  in erm
I know.
which chemist is it?
Er  Simm and Webb, they've got a notice on the window, have your cholesterol tested.
Why don't you go and see?
What for?
Well I would be interested  to see them put 
Well why don't you have your cholesterol tested.
I know what mine is, mine was erm  well below
Mm.
the last ti what did I have to go for?
The last time I went for a smear and  a blood pressure check and various things sh I, I said  are you doing cholesterol checks?
And she said no.
Would you like one?
And I said, yes I would please.
Anyway, I had to ring up after two week, can't you remember?
I rang up after two weeks  and I spoke to the nurse and she said, oh, your cholesterol's alright.
And I said  but what is it please?
And she said, oh well it's  no it was the receptionist, she said it's fine.
And I said, yes but I would like to know exactly  what my cholesterol count is.
So she said, oh I'll have to get the nurse.
So the nurse came on the phone and she sa she said  erm  oh it's, it's fine it's well within the limits.
And I said, but what is it?
So she said it was  five point  four, or five point six I think it was.
Why can't they just tell you?
Why do you have to drag these things out of people.

Cos Alex comes and he's putting a bet on, I says he'll have to put  ten pence each way or whatever for me on 
Mm mm.

Ah!
Oh oh!

I'm thinking about Tony.
Oh well.
Eighteen to one!
And it says, it's a stayer.

He might come.
But I mean it's
Anyway, talking of over the road, where is she?
Is she home?
No.
She's in the Cottage.
Still?
Same ward as Mr .
And has she been cleared o 
She's been quite ill.
No.
Has she?
She's been quite ill.
She's not, she's had a kidney  er, yes a kidney infection.
She's not
Er er
demanding to be home or anything?
No she's been  quite  very ill.
She's been very ill.
Er, but she's recovered.
But now she is wanting to be home.
Yeah.
But er  Doctor  had suggested to Jimmy  that erm  he try the new home this Friday.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Because they have qualified nurses apparently.
Mm mm.
And erm
Would she agree to it?
Well he hasn't dared put it to her.
Well, mind, she has been quite ill, but she's recovering now.
She'll say a few daft things like  she always says, how's my mother?
Oh!
But
And what does she think 
Oh!
of this carry-on?
Well I mean her mother's been dead  for, I don't know how many years.
Well how old is she, eighty
She's eighty two.
eighty two.
That's what I said to her when she said it the other day I said  how old are you Mrs ?
She said  eighty two.
I says, right.
How old would your mother be?
And I could see the  wheels turning 
Yeah.
round, see.
Then Jimmy said  well you know she's been dead for  many years  and er  she says, oh that's right.
And she just sort of brushed it off.
And she'll say to Jimmy  erm  I don't know how you're managing to look after yourself.
Who's getting your  meals ?
Well, of course Jimmy's got his own meals for  the whole of his life more 
Yes.
or less.
In fact, one of the nurses had said to Jim last night  your mum said  er  don't tell my brother  and then, then she said, your brother?
Who, who is your brother?
She said, I don't, I mean, don't tell my son.
So well Jim said, well what is it?
She said I can't  tell you, I haven't to tell you !
So he didn't know what she'd been up to.
Oh dear !
Oh yeah.
Well the thing is, she's got nobody to talk to there you see, she's in this little four bedder
Aha.
all the clo and like all closed off 
Mm.
and the lady  opposite
I've never been in wo in er  one or  two.
Two.
Two.
I've never been in ward two.
The lady opposite, erm  has had a stroke but she's not  exactly  and she's deaf
Oh yeah.
so she can't hear her.
Mrs  can't get up to go over to her.
Yes.
Now the lady in the bed diagonally, she, has to be hoisted everywhere.
Oh!
I think she must have had a really bad stroke.
Now she talks across to her, but she has a bit of a  ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, and it's difficult 
Mm.
Yes.
to understand.
Yes.
And the lady on the other bed  beside her, is erm  she's very deaf.
So, the result is that, that she just  sits there or lies there
Mm.
she can't, she can't stand or anything.
Who's Mr  got in with him?
Has he got
He's right at the bottom 
has he got 
of the ward  on the right  erm, and er, it's like a mens' ward.
Yeah.
Er, at the bottom and on the right and i it's all men, and I, I, I speak to them, but I don't know any of them er, personally.
Now, Mr   pardon me.
He goes into his riding on Wednesday
Oh!
cos he showed me his calendar.
He says, I'm going ma his speech is terribly good.
Mhm.
Erm  he forgets, he knows the word but he can't get it 
Get out.
out.
Yeah.
And he was trying, he says I'm going to my new home.
I says, when are you going?
And he tried to er, to get it out and he couldn't, then he pointed to the calendar
Oh.
and  on Sunday it says  Roger  comes.
They must have picked the wrong  
Yeah.
And then on Wednesday  it is erm  his riding  and I asked the sister, I said, is that right?
She said well depending how he  he holds up like.
Oh.
She says, there's been  
So are they selling his house?
Well it's not his.
Isn't it?
No.
Oh!
Who does it belong to?
He, he rented it privately, a private owner.
Mm!
Because that, he did mention that  he says  so the next thing is the home'll have to go.
You know the tears came at this time 
Yeah.
I says, yes.
I says it's sad.
I said you couldn't manage  on your own .
No, that's why he was frightened when they did the alterations.
Er, and they wanted him to move  out completely away somewhere, he was frightened he didn't get back in after.
Yeah.
And, I think he just moved in to  Muriel's next door.
Yes.
Yeah, that's right.
And he said well 
He did.
erm, he wouldn't leave in case they wouldn't let him back in after modernizing.
Yeah.
Oh well .
So  but  erm  Jimmy hasn't sort of put it to her yet.
Is Doug  going into the police  or applying?
Well he told me last year he'd applied.
I know.
He told me he applied but I thought he told me he'd been turned down.
Well I never heard the  well he had applied once before  and  he  he got as far an interview and then he  didn't get any further.
But then he applied just last summer for the Metropolitan.
Yeah.
Cos er erm 
I haven't heard the outcome of that.
Marie  Marie was going down to her mother's  she was running as usual, she dashed up to our back door and said, is Doug around?
And I said, I don't know what shift he's on, is his car out?
And it wasn't.
Mm.
And I said do you want a piece of paper to write him a message or something?
And she said, no it was just that  he's talking of renting his house  erm  and I know of someone who wants to rent one.
Oh!
So I said well where's Doug going?
Then she said something about  June  and the Met.
Oh well Doug wasn't here again, he never mentioned it.
Or did she say he's going for an interview in  June for the Met, or something, anyway.
Well he's not 
Cos I, I haven't seen him at all.
I walked up  from the woods with him, came 
Mm.
together, he never mentioned it.
In fact, I thought it must be all finished with because  he, he was quite talkative about it during the summer
Yes.
A well I remember a well I was, I was sure
then I, and he said to me about 
 
being turned down.
Oh!
Cos he hoped, if he got into the Met  and then he transfer  up here.
Oh!
You see, like  it's like  's grandson.
Yes.
I mean he started off in the Met  er  did his training and everything  and then I think he's up here somewhere now.
I tell you someone  erm  our boiler went wrong on  ah, I think it was Wednesday
Oh!
Thursday, I just can't remember, and Raymond came through
Yeah.
it must have been Thursday because I didn't want him to come, I said to Jim, tell him not to come we'll just turn the whole lot off.
But the kitchen was reeking  of 
mm.
fumes!
And, and 
Oh dear!
er, I could feel it prickling the back of my nose and my throat
Yes.
and  and my eyes started to water
Mhm.
I opened the windows.
Oh!
And there was  when it came on, in the afternoon there was this tremendous  very loud roar!
Now, it sometimes goes  whoosh!
Yes.
When they 
It comes on initially
Yes.
And dies down.
and it immediately dies down and then it's okay, but there was this tremendous roar  and a loud click and it went out.
And it was only about  we i it was wi within a couple of minutes, or, probably less  Jim came in  er  I think he was, I don't know where he'd been cos his day off was Thursday I think.
Yes he was.
And  I told him about it, and he said oh yes, the pilot light has gone out  and he relit it.
And it was fine.
It sounded okay  but we kept getting these fumes.
So we kept opening the door  it blew out once again and he put it on again  and we were still getting these fumes till about  oh  about half past five it seemed to stop,u we had the windows open.
Mm.
And then  Raymond phoned at about quarter to seven.
No.
He didn't.
Sorry!
Sorry!
It we he phoned at  it was, it was five to six, Jim was going to take me to aerobics because of the weather
Mm mm.
I had my wellies in case the leisure centre was flooded!
Ha.
There was only ten of us there.
Anyway, erm  Raymond was on the phone because he was tal and I was saying to Jim  tell him I don't want him to come if the ra if the road's cut off to Blythe I don't want him to get stuck, I mean, he's got a wife 
 
and two small children at home.
And I'm saying, it's time I was out, I'm gonna be  late .
Anyway, he insisted he was coming at half past seven.
And he came at half past seven and he cleaned it and he looked at it, and he said er  it wasn't  anything that he could see, he thinks it was just down draught, but we've had winds before.
And he said that  the cowl  we've got on that chimney
Yes.
off the kitchen and ru and runs the boiler, he said it's the best kind you can get, nothing should come in there.
And as he's driven up at the back then he looked up and he said  you ca you could see daylight through it so it was, wasn't blocked by anything.
Wasn't blocked.
Erm  but he said 
D'ya think it was the rain, maybe?
I don't know.
Driving wind?
I said could it have been continuous rain?
And he said something about  he'd once  they'd once had to work  all one day and all one night a near the Regent  Centre  because  er, something had gone wrong with the  gas pipes because erm of flooding.
Oh!
Right.
So whether we've  but nobody else seems to have noticed anything like this.
No, I, I haven't had anything like that.
Anyway, he couldn't find anything.
He said, we'll just have to  leave it  and, if it happens again we'll have to go into it further, but it hasn't happened again, so now it's okay.
Mm mm.
Except last night  I thought  what on earth's this?
It just smelt like Christmas cake cooking, and I wasn't cooking anything at all.
I mean  Jim went to work at one o'clock and the last of the kids  went home, I've had my dinner
Perhaps something's melting then.
at midday.
But i it was no, it was no stronger in the kitchen than the living room.
Mm.
I sniffed around the boiler, I sniffed around the cooker 
 

ah, but  when the kids went home I just had  ha I had a sandwich.
Mm.
That's all I had, I hadn't cooked anything.
Mhm.
Erm  the triplets had  soup  and  stottie and I warmed that up in the microwave.
Mm mm.
And this smell lasted for about half an hour and then, then I couldn't smell it again.
And it disappeared?
It's, what kind of boiler is that you have?
Er  ooh!
I can't remember the make.
It's one of these that uses less fuel.
More efficient.
Well we've had it, how long have we had it?
About  three, four years.
Anyway, how are the 
Well you've had a lo bother with it though haven't you?
We've have had,we 
Well about two or three 
Yes.
haven't you?
Th the shelf  with  containers on have been too close, you know those Tupperware containers?
Mhm.
Have been too close to it  and it had, and the vents at the back had got churned up with dust at one time, I keep dusting it now.
Oh!
Anyway, while I go Ra Raymond was here, he says, oh Alan's back.
And they said, well where from?
He said well he's got a transfer to Accrington.
Didn't you know he was in the prison service?
Is that 
I didn't 
his brother?
Yes.
Oh!
Right.
Oh!
And he had to go and train somewhere down south, but he's got a  he, apparently he'd been trying for a year and he's got to Accrington.
Oh!
Cos I thought he was doing pretty well in the Post Office, he was
Mm.
he was getting promotion.
Once you see th there's gonna be changes there possibly.
Oh!
Is there?
Yeah.
Well maybe not wi depends, depends whoever gets in.
Erm  that bloody racist.
It's, no, it, that's the Telecom I think, he actually worked for the 
Oh!
Oh!
Post Office.
Oh!
They er, oh aye.
He started off as a counter clerk
Right.
Right.
and worked his way  higher up.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Well I'm surprised that erm  actually going into the police force but he didn't hear when he 
No.
I mean it was just  day before yesterday I walked up with him.
I mean, last year was   Oh!
That's probably Gillian telling me  
Oh!
I saw Gillian  I met her round .
Ee!

That's the second time today I haven't remembered my 
Don't you know your own number?

I just got it off .
I'm carrying it over.
It is Gillian.
Yeah.
Oh!
Right.
So  righto Gillian.
Okay.
Bye for now.
Bye .
Well she says Michael hasn't rung so she said I assume that he's  coming  cos if he's  going to be late, if he's anywhere  reasonable
Yeah.
and finds a phone he rings and tells her.
Erm, because I was going out for half past two and er, she rang, she says he hasn't rung yet so I assume he's going to be home.
So that's alright 
Yeah.
isn't it?
I saw her briefly, and, I didn't even speak to her other than to say hello.
Dorothy and I took the triplets for their nursery visit  on
Oh!
Right.
Thursday 
Yes.
Yes.
Er  they wouldn't go and sit down for the story with all the other children sit at, sat on my knee on the floor for a short while.
Mm.
Cos, at home you see  er  Dorothy and Trevor always read their stories in bed, and when I read their stories I have me on the arm chair  two sitting on one chair arm
Yes.
and one sitting on the other chair arm
Yes.
so that they can all see the pictures.
All see the book.
Yeah.
So, they couldn't get it into their heads that you had to sit on the floor.
Mhm.
Mind, when I read their story on erm  I read them on Thursday afternoon and I said, right we better practise for nursery
Yeah.
so I had the older ones from Goose Hill
Mm.
you know the  when they were off school
That's right.
and I sat them  on the floor 
and they sat and listened then.
How old are the triplets?
They're three on the nineteenth.
Ah!
Right.
And, the other thing  it took a while for u for us to get them to, they'd never drunk milk out of a straw, through a straw 
Oh yes .
and a third of a pint bottle is too big.
Yeah.
I only give them half that much at a time.
Mhm.
Bryony especially tends to drink small amounts.
Mhm.
But you leave the cup on the table and she'll call you back every ten 
She keeps going back.
minutes for a sip.
Yes.
Yes.
But of course, they were picking the bottle up and they were trying to tip it as well .
So I'll have to get some straws and we'll have to practise 
Yeah !
that.
Aren't they bent straws or not?
No, this, they're quite, they didn't  th they were quite tough
Yes.
strong plastic ones so they  they didn't chew 
They'll soon 
they didn't chew them.
they'll soon fit in.
And er
Cos Stephanie will 
I know.
be there.
Was it morning?
Yes.
Ah, Jenny will be meeting Stephanie.
Yes, well when we came out  Bryony was difficult to start with, she didn't want her coat on.
Mm.
But Richard  I was trying to get his on a and I, I've, I've helped two other children to put theirs on, I don't know who they were, and Dorothy says, oh we better get out Ann the teacher wanted the  the visitors
Away.
to get out before 
Mm.
the others came.
Well, we just got out into the hallway where all these mothers were standing round  and
Yes.
Richard threw himself on the floor screaming!
Ee!
He wasn't going home.
Oh dear!
And I was try and he,he of course he's, he's heavy
Yes.
and when he just makes himself flop, he wouldn't stand up.
When I tried to sit him up 
Pick him up.
to put his coat on, I picked him up and tried to carry him, and he just flung himself around so hard I had to put him down and he immediately flung himself on the floor again!
Oh!
Lovely  exhibition .
Oh!
Golly!
Anyway 
And was it because he didn't want to leave?
Yes.
Oh!
He was staying there.
And we I was  I was trying to explain to him that erm  we've had to go home, the teachers were clearing everything up
Yeah.
all the children were going home 
For lunchtime.
because there were different children coming in the afternoon.
Mm.
But no, no.
So I picked him up and I carried him, Dorothy had gone out the wrong door, instead of going out the door at that end  she'd gone right along this long corridor
And come out the main door.
so I followed her and of course, we're going past all the blooming classrooms!
And the 
Yeah.
classrooms all had their doors open.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And  anyway I carried him half way along and I had to put him down
Mm.
I managed to get his coat on  and a woman came along, I, I don't know if she was a dinner lady or what, she had a  a sort of overall on  and er  I said come on let's catch up with your mummy, and she said, ah!
Are these triplets?
Are these 
Mhm.
Mr  's triplets?
Oh!
Right.
Aha.
And I said yes.
And she said, oh Mr  teaches  my son at school.
Oh!
She said, come along hold my hand as well and er, I'll tell my son tha that, that er Mr  's son  took me to the door.
So he shut up 
 
and listened to her.
Oh!
He'd calmed down tha 
Yeah.
by then.
Well I had trouble 
 
with Joshua on erm  what day will it be?
Erm  it must have been the last day, it must have been Friday, must have been Friday.
Cos usually, he's keen to go to Ron and Stephanie's.
Mhm.
He wouldn't get in his pushchair.
He wouldn't put his coat on.
Erm  I finally got his coat on, and then, I said, come on we'll walk.
No.
No.
And chuck his hat down on the kitchen floor.
I said, well I'd have to go and leave you then.
So, of course, he got up, I went to close the door  he was there  so  I tried him in his pushchair, I says well you'll have to walk, I know it's only five minutes away.
So
Mhm.
it was a bad day.
So er  he wouldn't move!
Got so far on, he stood and he started crying and yelling and, don't want to go!
Want to go home!
Don't want to go!
Now I used to get him along there  and  then he was sort of in tears but there was  kids in the hall, the little hall  and then when you sort come in the door, not the main door, the one, the 
Yes.
door you're supposed to come in.
The one we should have go gone in 
Yeah.
and come out of?
Well, immediately on the left there's a door  an and the hall goes along by the path that you, you come up to that door.
Yes.
And, the children were in there erm doing their P E and er  he went stood at the door and watched them and he was  quite happy.
And, they all filed out  and the  the caretaker, I presume, started putting the tables up, and the chairs for lunch
Mhm.
and er  he wouldn't keep out, so, so in the end the caretaker got him a little chair
Mhm.
and  sat him against the wall.
 
He said that's your chair, now  you can watch me.
Well he sat there as good as gold.
The only trouble was when Stephanie come out he didn't  want to come home .
Oh!
It was difficult.
It's a lovely nursery isn't it?
I haven't actually been in  to, I've only ever got as far as the .
They've got every kind of toy and equipment you can think of.
Yes.
And they've got it divided up into bits with a, sort of a little kitchen.
Are you still going up to start me off?
Well Gillian's been on the phone 
Or was that Gillian?
she says, she thinks Michael must be coming home because he hasn't rung her.
Right.
So you're not baby-sitting?
Well, not that I know of.
Not 
Aha.
unless he hasn't been near a phone and couldn't ring her.
Right.
So, I might get a call by half past two  but I doubt it.
Erm  and then there's one  like a little living room, it has a little settee in it and chairs, you know, child size?
Oh, Oh yeah.
Mhm.
And there's a big er  water play  bath sort of thing
Mhm.
and sand  and slides and
Well I know there's slides cos Stephanie talks about them.
Yes.
She loves it!
And every kind of building brick and  Duplo brick and Lego brick and Stickle brick and
things.
And plenty of easels and paint 
Aha.
and er  oh, they've also got books  yo you know you can buy the books
Oh!
Yes.
just  just in that er, sort of little tiny lobby bit
Yeah.
where you turn right to go into the  nursery
Mhm.
into the actual classroom
Mhm.
er, they've got  books on there
Oh!
and there's a, a book to sign and you can borrow any book 
Oh!
Right!
then you just sign the book to say you've got it.
Oh I see!
No I didn't know that.
And have you looked  erm, the headmistress took us outside to see the yard  and  that looks
No, I haven't been out 
huge 
there.
yard with a a apparently they have er, a lot of  in the summer  they do a lot of er  whatever they're doing out there.
Practically everything they do out there, they take all the equipment outside.
Yeah.
Well they have like  erm, sort of bogey things or something, cos I know  Stephanie was tipped out of one last
Oh!
year.
The friend was  erm  pushing her, and she came home with a big  bump on her head
Mm.
and erm  and that's what erm, the teacher came and said she'd fallen out of erm  one of the, er I think she said bogeys or something?
Because when Gillian came home, Gillian says who were you playing with?
And she said Melanie.
And, but she says it wasn't deliberate, it wasn't deliberate, it was an accident.
So Gillian had seen the teacher
Still around?
Still there.
Must a reluctant bride.
Erm, she said oh it was just purely and simply an accident that erm 
Yeah.
But she starts proper school in September.
Does she?
Mhm.
Mm!
Yeah, she's only four in August.
Is that, you put it flat onto it 
Mm.
it's a  windproof thing.
Yeah, she's only four in August.
Oh yes 
And erm
she's gonna be one of the very young ones.
and she's, she's really quite small, cos Mike isn't 
Yeah.
very tall.
Now Kate 
Ya.
takes after her mum.
But 
Mm.
er Stephanie's  quite small really  but, she's all there, she's, she's quite bright.
Do you remember when I had erm  Michael   he's fifteen now.
The one whose mum had multiple sclerosis  they lived at Upham Pond.
Oh yes!
Yeah!
He was only four and one week when he started school.
Well, Stephanie's just going to be 
His birth er his birthday was the thirty first of August  and  I think it was, I can't remember when he started 
About the sixth or something 
it was the fifth or the sixth of
September.
I think it was the sixth  of September.
And he was    I know he was chubby but he was quite  short.
Yeah.
He looked so young.
And, Joshua now goes to the playgroup at the erm  Saint Aden's Church.
Oh yes.
That's where er
I think just one day a week visiting allowed.
Dorothy takes the triplets on Mondays.
Right.
Oh.
They, they are actually starting nursery school on the fifth of May.
They seem so tiny to be going five mornings a week though.
The triplets?
Mhm.
Er fifth of  that's just next month?
Yes.
Oh!
I don't 
So is she going to drop them off there earlier?
Yes.
Er  well, well she'll obviously 
Or have you to go there?
collect them on Mondays and Fridays
Mhm.
and walk up, they'll get the minibus down.
I forgot to notice exactly where the mi where the bus stop outside the school.
They just stop anywhere.
You just wait outside the gate, Gillian just waits outside her gate.
The minibuses will stop anywhere, you just put your hand out.
Oh!
Jus erm  park yourself, you know, away from the entrance
Yes.
erm
Well I'll have to move myself away from the school gate  they can just  they think I'll be actually waiting 
That's right.
That's right.
at the school gate.
But erm, er, they drop you off wherever you want to be dropped off and then pick you up  I mean I  I come down on occasions  and I just stand outside their gate.
Oh.
Erm  and I've noticed that they drop people off.
They drop Jessie off at her door next door  they drop somebody else two or three doors down, er, they'll stop anywhere.
Oh that's fine.
And they run every erm
And the  yeah 
five minutes I think it is.
Mm.
Their grandma said to me yesterday, have you worked out how you're going to get to  nursery?
And I said, well yes I'll just walk up and I'll get the minibus back.
And she said, will you manage?
But, I've had them on buses several times just when I, when I'm going on a bus.
Well now the occasions
It won't be a special treat any more once  they're coming back from nursery three times a week on a bus will it ?
That's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
Erm  I mean I go up there 
And probably when I was 
at half past eleven, but that's when Gillian's on  doing the manager's job which is nearly twice a, twice a year.

And then Paul takes me  up to their house  where I, usually about ten past eleven  gives me time to get the pushchair put up again and
sorted out  and then I just walk along and pick up Stephanie.

So erm  but that's only about three times a year at the most.
Yeah.
Have I seen you since erm  I haven't seen you to talk to for very long have I?
No, well I, I tend to keep away at nights when I, cos I think erm, those triplets so you must be
absolutely worn out and ready for peace and quiet.
Cos I know what it is myself with  I mean, they're different ages but, and they're independent  but it's wearing.
Well it's 
Questions all the time.
d'ya know it's funny, on a Wednesday when I go, when they've gone home and I've tidied up a bit 
Mhm.
and gone straight to aerobics for six o'clock
Mm.
I feel quite fit by the time I get back, you know  by the time I've done 
 
the aerobics  you sho I should be feeling absolutely knackered!
Absolutely !
But I'm not.
I fe I fe I feel, you know
Full of beans!
I feel full of beans and quite 
 
hungry by then.
Well I, when I come back from Stop Hill when I've been on a long shift till five o'clock, I'm whacked because  their bungalow is so warm
Yes.
and it, really it drains.
Mm.
It's like Jim at work he's shattered when he comes in.
Ee!
I come here 
 
I sit down, I yawn and it comes to bedtime and I'm really too tired to go up the stairs.
Mm.
I feel absolutely, and I think thank goodness I'm back  in my draughty old house !
 
Wha oh dear!
I never feel cold in your house.
Well, it's alright if, you know, if you're in a room where the fire's on, although I have had the heating on  erm  a few days recently because of the cold.
But I was hoping it was off for good er  but it didn't work out that way cos of the weather.
Erm  I thought I'll try and save a bit of gas  this month.
This quarter.
But erm  and I, I got my er microwave and I'm trying to save some electric.
I've been doing most of my  cooking with the
Aha.
rather than putting a big oven on.
Yes.
And if  some, er,jus it was very thin slices of beef, topside of  well I thought I'll get some beef out, and I did it in the microwave and it cooked  but it was  it was quite tough.
I think if I'd had er  no teeth I wouldn't have been able to manage at all, or if I had
You might have slightly overcooked it.
That's what he said.
It's, you tend, to start with you do tend to erm
Yeah.
overcook things.
Yeah.
Well it  there wasn't a recipe to cover just what I was doing with the 
I know i i it
and it was just a case of  erm  pot luck, I would sort of brought it out and looked at it and, er no it wasn't cooked, it was cooked on the edges so I turned it over and  turned it round and put it back in again.
Did you let it stand?
Yes.
For a while after?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Before it carries on.
Er it was
It's like when you cook 
it was cooked 
cakes they look as if they're not quite cooked
Mhm.
but by the time they've stood for five minutes they are.
Well 
Did you remember if you cook a cake and you put a piece of erm  kitchen paper over the top
Mhm.
I don't.
Oh.
I, I can't remember where I got, I remember telling  Beryl that a long 
Oh!
time ago
Right.
Well I
well before she knows
well I've cooked a
Someone who told me roundabout that 
a cake recipe 
time.
The other thing is  yes.
but it was, to me, it was more like a erm  er, er a sponge  erm  like a pudding sponge.
Yes.
What 
Er 
kind of a cake did you make?
It was just a plain erm  Victoria
Oh.
sponge recipe.
Chocolate cakes are, are very nice if 
But I didn't have a proper tin.
you do, brown, but use brown sugar.
Yes.
I made a pudding actually 
And u and dark brown 
A pudding.
sugar.
I that's nice and 
Yeah.
moist.
But  when you, when you time  when the cooked cake's finished cooking
Mm.
if you leave it for two minutes
Mm.
run a knife round
Mhm.
tip it up onto your hand, just briefly 
Mm.
just for a second, and then 
Mhm.
back a again.
Yes I did.
Let's the air go, and get underneath
Yes.
and that helps the bottom to dry out quicker.
Yeah.
Now  someone else told me, and it worked, and if you just lay a piece of kitchen paper over the top, that absorbs some of the moisture 
The moisture.
as well and ta and the top isn't so soggy.
Mm.
Well I didn't have 
But chocolate cakes are definitely the best.
Well I did a chocolate pudding 
In the microwave.
and it was lovely.
Erm 
Yes.
but this  cake that I made  erm  we thought was more like a  a pudding  and I
Yeah but they're so 
put jam on it
they're so pale as well.
and the next day it, it was  sort o like a rock, well not 
The o 
exactly, but it was pretty 
the only cakes I make in erm  in a microwave are  chocolate cakes
And are they alright the next day?
Yes.
They're a lot moister if you, if you use dark brown sugar
Yeah.
they definitely are a lot more moist.
Mm mm.
And as long as you don't over, overcook them.
Mm.
Mhm.
And I'll tell you what I always do.
But what, what do you make them in?
Er, like a, a deep er flan, erm 
I've got these, you know the very thin microwave dishes?
They're getting a bit battered now.
Plastic?
They're very thin plastic.
No.
I haven't got 
They're about 
any plastic ones.
Th I got them in the electricity board, there three for sixty pence.
Oh!
You're only, I think you're only supposed to use them for a, a few months, I've been using them for about three years.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Er, they've got a dimple in here and there.
Mhm.
But er
Cos it's a, my recipe said a, a 
 
a souffle dish.
Well I'd smashed 
Yeah.
my souffle dish.
But I had, I, I  I never thought, I have a casserole dish which is about the  the same height as the 
Mhm.
souf I could have done it in there 
That might help.
but I didn't, I did it my pyrex  bowl
Yeah.
which of course, the bottom is narrower than the top.
Yes.
And it came right up like that 
Ah!
Ah!
and it come over the top !
These things are about  so high.
Smales 
Yeah.
have a lot of microwave dishes.
Yeah.
They're about that wide and they're about that deep and I just put a circle of greaseproof in the bottom
Mhm.
don't grease them or anything.
Oh, just put the greaseproof in?
Ju I just lay a piece of greaseproof in the bottom.
Oh!
Now, I grease mine and er, I put the greaseproof in.
I don't grease them I just put this  I've got  a pile of little circles of greaseproof paper ready cut to to fit the 
 
bottom of the 
Oh, well you're well organized.
three dishes.
You're well organized.
Well I, I do 
I've done it for all kinds of things, I mean, I, I cook vegetables in them in it and I warm up 
Yeah.
tins of peas in it.
I warm up baked beans for the children's 
Yes.

Pa Paul does that.
In fact, they're 
And I've 
stained with tomato soup.
Mm.
Baked potatoes, we've had quite a lot of baked pot 
I don't know why I get tomato soup with all that colour in it.
baked potatoes, and er it makes lovely erm  custard.
Yes.
Lovely custard.
Er
And 
the only thing is I haven't got a big enough jug so I have to do half quantities.
I make mine, I make my, my custard in erm  er  I think it is  it's a casserole about so wide, it's my biggest casserole.
Oh right!
It's in a, about 
It's a round one about that far across.
about a three pint?
Er er  nearly two pint I think 
Two pint.
it'll be.
It's about this shallow 
Oh well, I put 
I found it, it, it, it seems to cook quicker.
Yeah.
Oh I could be using that, that 
Erm  the last time 
casserole dish.
I made  half a pint of  white sauce in the  measuring jug  I 
Mm.
boiled it all over the place.
The last time I made  about half a pint of  bread sauce, I lost half the bread sauce all over it !
Oh well I can do half a pint successfully, but I've gotta watch.
Yeah, you need to stir it every minute or so.
Yes.
I have to, I have to watch it.
Er, I can do half a pint
And you don't
quite well.
no you know your erm  smoky  glass beakers
Aha.
don't use those in 
Oh no.
I haven't.
Nancy  used one of those in it  and she just lifted it out and the whole lot shattered all over 
Chee ee!
the place.
Yes.
But I read  you know when you make your coffee in it
Mhm.
Well Paul makes his in  there.
Give it a stir first.
It's just recently I read about this  it's not getting air into it or something is the reason it ex it can suddenly shoot up all over you.
Oh it's in my book, yes, it can come 
Well I always 
up.
I put the coffee, my milk powder, and the water in
Aha.
and, stir it  anyway 
Aha.
Mhm.
and then put it in, and it's  so far  it's been okay.
Well Paul makes, he does hot chocolate actually
Yes.

I di er, I only have er  I only make chocolate .
But mine has a, mine has a grill, I got one with a grill
Oh yes.

Yes.
covered  and then I erm  switch off microwave and put it on grill and it browns
Yes.
erm
I haven't got one of 
the breast.
those of course.
Well mine's a Moulinex.
When this wears out  I'm gonna 
I got it 
get rid of this one.
I got it cheap at the Co-op at Lyme.
I went to Argos to get this particular Moulinex.
Yeah.
And they didn't have it in there, they just had the  the touch oven ultra erm  is that on?
Yeah.
Tt!
Oh!
God!
Erm  and it was quite expensive.
Erm, and so I said no I can't afford that, cos I sold my shares you see.
Yeah.
I'm glad I did, they've gone right down.
Have you noticed?
Yes.
Erm  so  Paul says come on, we'll have a look in the Co-op  and here they had  the very same one I wanted in the Co-op  and it was ten pound cheaper.
Well you know when we got our Vax  vacuum cleaner
Yes.
that was ten pounds cheaper than Argos.
Really?
So, er we got that at the Co-op.
It was 
Really?
a hundred and forty nine
Yes.
in  or a hundred and forty nine ninety nine or whatever it was, I can't remember  in erm  Argos
Mhm.
and it was ten pounds cheaper in the Co-op.
Well
But  so we got it there.
this is what we found cos I said, oh
There was something else, you know when I got the  when I got my food processor
Mhm.
that was something like eighty pounds, I can't remember exactly
Mhm.
but for some reason we'd been to Gateshead, and I'd looked up food processors in the Argos catalogue
Mhm.
and the Index, Littlewoods 
Mm mm.
catalogue  and we were in Argos, I mean, sorry, we're in Gateshead  and we  I know  I was trying to get erm  a very pale peach wallpaper  for, for the 
Oh right.
bathroom to match  the very, very, very  extremely pale peach
I know.
flowers that we've got 
Yeah.
on so many tiles
Yes.
and I couldn't get any.
And, we've looked in Mawpers, and we've Newcastle, and Jim said let's go to Gateshead.
I can't  somebody had a sale on in Gateshead so we went there  and then we went to the Co-op, and of course, I got the exact paper I wanted, just sort of this mottley  mottley, marbly pale peach 
Mm mm.
paper.
And we looked at erm  food processors
Mhm.
and we got the food, food processor, it was cheaper than Argos and Index
Mm mm.
I got a free, there was a free electric carving knife with it
Oh!
Right!
plus, at the time there was five percent  extra off  erm, cos Jim's got a, a Co-op gold card
Mhm.
and if you got it through this gold card there was another five percent off so or  something like that off.
Yes.
So, we got a real bargain there.
Oh!
You got, you got quite a few 
Yeah.
bargains didn't you?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm very careful with my money.
I always 
Yeah.
check if them things are cheaper first .
Well erm  I do most things  in it if I can.
I did some pork chops er, the other day  erm  and, and they cooked  they cooked very well.
Yes.
They cooked very well.
Mhm.
Erm
That, that erm  yellow ex  Telecom van
Yeah.
that usually parked down 
That parks on 
the end of the road
Yeah.
is that the same one that's just gone past with  it said erm  snacks?
I could just er say read it when it went by 
Oh I didn't know.
in big red writing it said snacks, and one er, I couldn't make out what 
Whose is it?
I don't know.
Has somebody started up in business?
I wondered if it was ?
Oh !
Don't mention the !
 
I'd love to slaughter that child!
Were you having trouble with them the other night?
Having trouble?
Did you not hear about when they broke the thing?
Well I  I went out to them, and  because I heard banging, and I looked out the window and they were hacking at my fence, and I went out bu and was playing war with them when Jim crossed the road with one of them following behind and away down the street, and I thought oh!
Jim must have had  trouble.
And 
He 
then when I was in the kitchen I saw Mr  go to your door later 
Yeah.
one night.
And, I've gone out, it wasn't  that was hacking my fence mind, erm, it was another boy, I didn't know him with a , and I went out and I, I  and he said, I wasn't.
I says, yes you were!
And, that chap that lives  two below Mrs , they haven't been in very long with 
Yes.
a little dog.
Aha.
He came out the curtain  and swore at him.
And he said, yes you were.
He says, I saw you!
So I says, right get away from my property!
And they'd hacked two or three of the erm  the wood  erm  staves on the fence.
Mhm.
Now, when I came back from Stop Hill the other night, must have been, oh must have been Thursday, cos Paul erm, was going out with Alec and then they were going to Alec for dinner  and when I came back  one of the  erm  wooden staves was off  here, had been prized off.
Cos Paul put it on the next day.
So, a couple of nights 
One of ours was off as well.
couple of nights later, I looked down and here's three of them, boy, somebody else  and another 
 
one, and one was sitting on my fence, there, so I banged on the window and said get off the fence!
Erm  he just, he just sat there and
Mhm.
like that, I said,get off that fence !
And he just  he took no diving notice and they all were giggling at me.
See, so I went out  I said, get off my property you're trespassing!
I said, that is my property and when you sit on my fence  that is a, an offence!
Now, I says I'll get the police the next time!
Okay.
So they just casually got off and walked away.
I don't know who he was but he was with .
Mm.
I'm frightened to leave home.
You had trouble as well have you?
Well, Jim had just put something through Bob's letter box
Mm mm.
and he heard  there was a crash  and  Martin  said, ee!
I've broken the glass.
Mhm.
And the other two, Ali and tha you know the  erm, Bangladeshi boy down    he plays with them.
There was Ali and the  and Michael .
Yeah.
And Jim came along and he says what did you say?
Mhm.
He says I've broken the glass.
And he said well just get yourself home and tell your father that I want it paid for this time because I only replaced that glass last week, which he had 
Yeah.
Mhm.
he'd put it in at the beginning of the week before.
So he came in and he, he, he said I'm just going down to see  's father, he's just smashed the glass in the cold frame and I'm  I'm sick of this!
Cos he's already stopped him setting fire  to trees in the orchard over there.
Oh yeah.
Mm.
That's awful that.
He's stopped him cutting down trees.
So he went down  and it was Kelly  he spoke to  and er  she said he
Thank you for the parcel.
Weren't you expecting this?
No.
Oh!
You, when you rang the other night  you, you did sound like Jackie , I'm sure you were Jackie  on the phone, and with her not living here very long
Aha.
Thought it was 
thought 
me.
I thought she'd just er  you know, she was worried about her children cos  as usual they'd left the keys behind, they were the house.
Ah.
Yeah.
Oh well, if you don't know.
There again, it's gonna be, it's something like, that  said it was forty four days and suddenly I thought, bugger that!
I'm going .
Forty four days?
Aye.
Oh.
Oh well.
And I thought bloody hell .
Don't be daft.
Are you going to get 
 
to pay your debts with a  pan 
No I've got 
in your hand !
Ah no, this is, I'm just getting us a new pan.
Say, a big one, over the road they normally have it.
Oh!
Erm
You know my bathroom tiles are coming on  Tuesday.
Mhm.
Right.
I mean the bathroom's not yet done, it's still not a  of paper one side.
Oh.
Well then, while 
Once you got 
you can you've gotta 
got 
sell out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was up the street and  got the building society here.
We want some erm  er, what they call them?
Quarry tiles
Aha.
you know to step down into the kitchen.
Yeah.
I would like some quarry tiles on there, but we can't get any of the narrow ones, they've got a curved edge.
Mind, I'll have to go buy one cos I've seen them in Newcastle.
In Wroxons I get my plants  and they've got them cheaper  than .
Well they told, they, they told us that we couldn't get i they couldn't get us any
No.
with a curved edge.
And I don't want the little ones  tripping up and crashing their heads on a
Oh I see.
Mm.
And, and  in the corner where the door is there's a hole in the step underneath the  the door hinge.
Oh!
And er  James, triplet  he's pres er  pushing bits of paper and  I should imagine there's pens and crayons and all kinds down there.
The only thing you could do is get the, you know that kind of plastic edging you can get for  wall tiles
Yeah.
with curved  put a bit of that in.
That 
Yeah.
would take the raw, the raw edge off.
Aha.
It will curve it down.
You can get them in the square ones, the six by six, but I wa I wanted  the way we worked it out, eight by four would work out more economical.
Aha.
Cos eventually, I wouldn't mind the kitchen having quarry qua quarry tiles.
No I don't like them.
I like quarry tiles.
Right.
See ya!
I, the, I wonder it's for?
I don't know, it's been, I went  along to ask Betty and Paul if they knew .
It's been there since  before half past one I think.
I was putting the washing on at the back and I saw the en the bit sticking past the house.
It's that fella  the  probably going to a wedding.
I think it must be a, I think it must 
He's got it 
be a driver.
He can't, he can't be actually at a wedding because
She can just pretend it's her new car.
.
Oh yes!
 
We can dream!
Bye.
Hello.
Why's the door off the latch?
Oh!
Oh!
Mm.
I know what it was  erm  the Empire Stores' man  brought a parcel for Jackie when she was out  and when 
Yes.
I took it along  to her, to save me locking myself out I put the  sneck up.
I must have forgotten to put it down when I came in again.
Well I'd better go and lock the door.
That was hours ago.
Didn't know if you were in or not.
Well I'd hardly be out if the door wasn't  locked when it's dark.
Yes, but it seemed so odd that the door was standing open.
Ooh!
And there was
Was the inside door closed?
Yes.
Mm.
The inside door was closed.
We haven't got any 
Yeah.
of next door's cats upstairs then?
No.
No, no cats could get in.
Oh !
Have you had a good day?
Well it, it depends what you mean by a good day?
It's tiring.
Heavy .
Why?
Did you  have any deaths?
No, no deaths thank goodness.
There's a lot of poorly people I'm afraid.
Oh.
But they're all alright tonight.
Not expecting any deaths yet.
Yet.
Mm.
Had enough for this week.
Right.
I'll get you something to eat.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
A bit.
Alright.
Well it's now, I'll just warm it up.
Okay?
Thank you.
Yes.
Ah !
Was Jackie in?
And so you took the parcel?
Yes.
And she gets any, a lot of parcels that woman.
She must be the best, one of the best customers they've, she, they've got.
Yes, but she's got all the erm  she's got hundreds of  well not hundreds, but she's got a lot of customers, I mean, she works in  huge offices doesn't she?
Yes.
It's the biggest  erm  fraud er o well civil service outside London.
Yeah.
Right.
There was erm  what I thought was a, a white Rolls  parked outside our house when I was putting the washing on the line  just after you went to work.
Erm  well  I've gotta wash the dishes.
I was with, and it was, I could see it at the front.
Oh!
Er, it turned out it wasn't a Rolls it was a Bentley, but I don't know one car from 
Oh yeah.
another.
A 
It's still a rather  classy car.
Yes.
Well it looked like a wedding car cos there were bouquets in the back.
Mhm.
And, Paul was working on his car out the front  and I went to ask him if he knew who was getting married.
And er  he said it had been standing there for quite a while.
He thought it was  maybe just  er  the driver had taken someone to the church  was waiting to go back for them.
And er  Betty called me in for a cup of coffee but    and I was there, I think, for over two hours.
Tt.
I didn't mean to stay that long  cos I had a lot to do.
Anyway, it was, it was still there 
Like what?
it was still there when I took 
What do you mean you had a lot to do ?
Like what?
Housework!
Why?
It was still there  when I took Jackie's parcel to her and it wa I, I think  I didn't look out the, the window  till about five o'clock and it had gone then.
But Betty 
Well , 's a taxi driver.
Yes.
And tho erm  Betty thinks the er  the  for  do er cars as well.
Mm.
Yes.
See if it is hot enough.
Thank you.
Has that just come through the letter box?
No it came before.
Oh.
I'll make you some 
Yes.
coffee.
Yes, it's  hot enough thank you.
Right.
Is it raining?
I suppose it is.
I don't know if it is.
Well the back wall looks wet.
Well th there was no rain on it when I came  came here.
Must have su must have suddenly started.
It is raining.
I got the washing  nearly all dry anyway.
All the shirts.
I didn't  it was so bright and  windy so  I put another lot in after that lot came out  it'll be, only be  T-shirts I'll have in the dryer when they finish off.
Well these poor blighters who got flooded  who  could do with the wind to dry the houses out couldn't they?
Yeah.
The er 
The what?
I delivered those leaflets this morning  in Auburn Place  the house at the end
Which one?
the one that was flooded, the one that was
The one facing onto the bridge?
Yes.
That er  Tess  bought  and they did it all up.
When they told me at work she'd bought that, I was, cos they lived up at Green Lane  I thought my God he'd have  they've picked a  a bad spot there cos there's no flood protection at all there.
And in fact, when the river rises they  it drops down onto that house, and the house next door.
Anyway, I saw that everything was up, the doors, the back door was open, the front door was open  there was everything up from downstairs and  must be awful.
Well I saw the curtains were down  erm  when I took  the triplets
all around there yesterday, the curtains were down and it looked as if there was  a table piled up with cardboard boxes in the, in the front window.
There was.
Well there's, it was er  there was a table.
And a house further along  in  Abbey View there  cos i and it was four houses actually in the 
The one on ?
No.
Th the one just past the social club?
No not that one.
Well that one, I wa I, I delivered there.
But, no, about three houses on from that  they were decorating.
Now, it looked as if they were newly decorating so whether the water got into there or not, but it didn't look  as if they were in the process of decorating so  I hope it didn't for their sake.
Well, that one on the cor the first one
Aye.
That's the one that appears on television .
That was the one that was on television with the water right  the way 
Yeah.
up it.
But further on, you know er, what they call, the teacher lives?
Brian ?
They've got erm  sort of walls in front of the houses, right next to the, the bay windows with erm  with the slot, where they, they slot in these steel erm, plates.
Have they?
Yes.
Oh yes.
About two or three of them, they have, at that end.
I never noticed that.
Yep.
With erm  and they had sand, they all had sandbags along there, but they had these sort of  er  walls built up.
But I mean th they're decorative walls, they've got plants growing in the top and this sort of thing, built up to the, about the level of the window
Mhm.
and er  then they have  the gap for the path and they have a, erm  a steel plate.
Because when I went up I had to climb over the steel plate.
Cos they hadn't removed them.
Mhm.
Even though the water was all down.
But erm
Have they done 
the 
that themselves?
I think so, yes.
I think so.
Yes, cos they're not the same.
I mean each  each house is different but er  there's  not all of them have them, there's only two or three had done that.
And that was at Brian  's end.
The ones 
And he, he is the very end one isn't he?
I dunno if he's  er, but it's his end, I don't know if it's his house, I can't remember if it was his house, but at that end of the street.
Didn't he buy the one that we looked at, once?
We did look at one there.
I can't remember.
I don't know.
But in any case, erm  th the end house hasn't got that up  it's  oh, what they call her?
Rosie?
Rosie .
Her house has.
And the house next to her, on either side, those are the three houses that have got that on.
I've never seen Ro Rosie  for years!
I know, she's working erm
Well her husband was very ill wasn't he?
at the workers' education  what is it called?
W E A?
Workers' Education Association.
She works, she works for that.
Does she?
Oh!
Erm
What doing?
Does she lecture like?
Yes.
I think, yes.
What subject?
I can't remember, but there was a whole
Well it can't be in Moorford because the only thing that 
No it's at Ashington.
the only thing they do in Moorford is  birds.
Ornithology.
No, erm  I'm sure it's in a, at Ashington.
Mm.
And
Well I've never seen 
 
it advertised.
They do quite a, they've got quite a big programme in Gosforth and Newcastle  and
I'm not sure.
I think
Whitley Bay I think as well.
I think  I think I heard Jean   say something about erm  the writers' workshops.
Mm.
I'm not sure if  she said tha that Rosie had, had given them a lecture or something once, then I said oh!
 
I know Rosie  quite well.
There's your coffee.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That was very 
Was it hot?
nice.
Thank you 
Was it 
very much.
hot enough for you?
Yes, it was hot enough.
It looked as if it was.
Well I don't like it too hot,ever.
Pardon?
I don't like hot food ever.
Oh I know, you're like my mother, stone cold!
I don't like it stone cold, I just like it nice, cos if it's too hot you can't taste it.
Try to get it down me before it burns my tongue!
 
These folks and that with all these spices and things a you can't taste the food  you taste 
I know.
the spices.
Cos that's what it was all about,tas take away the taste  of the rotten food, that's the whole point of spices.
I know, I think it's hilarious!
Asdir  erm  saying my ginger wine was too hot.
Was too hot.
Bloody ridiculous!
When she's used to eating  red hot curries
But they don't drink red hot stuff I suppose.
I suppose that was the difference.
They don't drink red hot stuff, they drink,only eat red hot stuff, and they drink  cool things to cool their mouth down after !
She drinks tea.
Yeah.
Well she  she used to drink tea when she  if I ever  well I didn't invite her in for a coffee do, well I didn't to begin with did I?
Well they drink, do they not, does she 
I mean 
not drink coffee?
No.
I invite, when we walk back from school  erm  when she first came to live  round there, and er  I used to walk back from school with her sometimes  and say, would you like a cup of coffee?
Well she didn't know anybody of course and she'd say, no  thank you .
And then after  oh, after a few weeks she said  I'll come in for a cup of tea.
So I said, okay.
So I used to make tea for her.
And it got, in the end, actually, if I was, if I had to do something  that was urgent  or I had to go somewhere  I used to have to say to her  something like, you know, erm  oh I better get on, I got a lot to do this morning, or  I'm goi I've to be shopping and  be back in time to cook Jim's dinner or something like that cos he's starting, oh I've gotta have his dinner ready at twelve before he goes to work and  if I really was pushed  otherwise she would have come in every day.
Not that I minded her coming in every day, just didn't, not always that time.
Aye.
I wonder how they're getting on through there?
And also, if she came in  when I had the triplets  it meant that erm  you know, she was sitting talking to me when I wanted to be playing with them and  taking them out and getting on with doing things with them.
They still haven't sold the house have they?
No.
Well I was just talking about that today to Betty.
You ar di didn't you see it?
Didn't you show someone round it once?
Yeah, I've shown two lots of people round.
Did you notice the bathroom ceiling?
Yes..
I only saw it erm  you showed two lots round didn't you?
Mm mm.
I did.
I only showed er, Gillian 
I didn't show them right u opened the house and was stood with them, walked round with her like, you know, but  breezed
Well actually the time I went in it was erm  when Gillian  was thinking of buying it
Oh aye.
and er  I went  her mother and father were with her  and I just really went in up and down the stairs, and they went upstairs and they, they shouted, oh Ann!
Come and look at this.
And er  in the back  I think it was the back bedroom  there was a, a light switch  and the wiring  was sort of hanging from, from the switch.
It looked dangerous!
Mm.
And there was  there was something weird.
It wasn't a telephone point  I don't know what it was.
Television point?
No, it came from  half way along the hall, up under the stair carpet  and into the erm  front bedroom, but it, it didn't have a, a sort of, you know the
Yes.
Aye.
it didn't have a telephone, sort of attachment.
And the bathroom ceiling was black mould!
And of course, if it, if it had been  I know they came once  because
Who came?
Well, Syrej
Oh.
dropped Asdir off  and she drove away and I saw her and the four children go, along to the house
Mm.
cos I was in here  and er  I think she had some paint in her hand
Oh.
and after about ten minutes I thought  what the devil is she doing in there!
No, she only had the three children, erm  Asthana wasn't born.
That was it.
Yeah.
I thought, what's she doing in there?
Tha that's right, she was pregnant wasn't she, after
Can't be.
Asthana wasn't born when she left here.
That's right, she was .
Mm mm.
Well surely she was born when  .
No,go well perhaps it wasn't long after Asthana was born.
Anyway, it was, it was in the winter.
Erm
Is it two years now?
Oh I can't remember.
It is, you know.
I think Asth 
Eighteen months old.
Two Christmases.
No,Januar .
Janu 
It's two Christmases anyway.
it's January the seventh.
Asthana's birthday, she must be two.
No, no, no, no, she's the .
Oh!
They moved before Christmas.
I know it's two Christmases.
Aye.
Well, whatever.
And er  well that might have been it,A Asthana might have been a tiny baby.
So I went along there cos I thought  if she was painting  the children will be frozen and nothing to sit on and no 
Mm mm.
heating.
So I went down, and she was, she was painting the bathroom ceiling.
And I said  er, I'll take the children back to my house with me, at least they'll be warm, I can give them a drink or something.
So they came back  but of course, if it's jus if it's been pouring in on that bathroom ceiling again it's, it, when I took, when Elsie called up to me, come and look at this, the bathroom ceiling was black mould!
It wasn't black when I  showed those people round, but it was damp.
You could see 
Oh no.
the stains of the damp.
Perhaps he's been and washed it off again.
Sometimes when he comes 
Yeah.
through.
Aye.
But nobody, how long is it since the last time we showed them in?
It's quite a while now.
I dunno.
I can't remember when it was.
And the key's still on our kitchen windowsill so 
Yes.
Yeah but look at, the amount of houses that are for sale.
Oh yes, but  but look how quickly Marie sold hers.
But it was in a better state.
Better condition wasn't it?
Oh it was beautiful!
I know.
Aye.
But I mean, there's a lot of houses for sale.
Some of them are sold quite quickly.
There's some new people in number  ten is it?
I don't know.
They park their car just beside Doug's house.
I don't see them very much, they tend to use the back door, and sort of come out and then go down 
Mm.
the back lane.
I don't see them come round the front.
You haven't drunk your coffee.
Did you see your mother?
Yes.
And she's complaining about not going anywhere or
Ee!
The places she's been in the last couple 
 
of weeks.
Yes.
She's 
If she could only remember where she'd been  and how much she's enjoying it while she's actually doing it.
Aye.
Cost me a fiver for her hair to be done on Monday and another fiver to go out on  Berlin Square on Tuesday.
And tomorrow, she's going to this  thing at the chapel.
Going for tea.
What thing at the chapel?
Going for tea and then for the service afterwards.
Mm!
Oh yes!
So they're going about four o'clock.
I'll have to go  earlier to see her because they'll be  maybe getting her changed for that.
Aha.
Karen came and asked me  I says alright.
Have you got to go?
And I said yes.
Mind, she didn't go out this afternoon cos they went, some of them went up to the British Legion Club this afternoon.
Didn't she want to go?
Or wasn't there room?
I don't know.
She were up sick all night, but I don't think she, she would have wanted to go anyway.
The erm  you know the rather large lady that, who I always speak to?
Er, yes.
In the last bed there.
Yes.
Er, she'd been up there sometimes .
She's really enjoyed herself because  tipple .
What had she been drinking?
She likes her whiskies.
Oh.
A couple of whiskies.
Yeah, she said it was really 
Well your mother wouldn't want that.
I know.
And it was she who told me that she'd been, that's where they'd been.
And she remembers everything.
I know.
Aye.
Your mother doesn't remember where she's been as soon as she's, gets  out of the minibus.
Yes, I know.
Tt!
I mean, and she, and 
Well I was just thinking 
she asks the same question over and over again.
looking at those  well it was Denise who brought the list in, but I'd already  with the sta er the gardens  but, you know  the garden scheme in Northumberland.
It's lying around somewhere.
Aye.
And I thought you might want to go some time anyway  er, not on a Sunday.
But  there's one at Blagden Hall.
Has she got her colostomy bag back on yet?
Or are they still leaving it off?
I don't know.
How do they take her anywhere if she's got the bag off?
Must, well that's you out.
Well, I was thinking we could perhaps take her to Blagden Hall now that's open.
Well supposing you, if that's okay.
I mean
Anyway, they're having  it's
it's one thing being in a hospital but to take her somewhere 
it depends, it depends on the weather.
enclosed is
It depends on the weather of course.
not very fair to her.
So that, I mean that's  I'm a half day that day.
I think I read that Blagden was open from  half past 
It's open from 
one till half past three  or something.
Well that's, no, it's been 
Or was it half past one, where did I put it?
Was it half past one to dusk.
It's just there.
That's it there.
It's not much
It's later.
It's my half day on the, that Sunday.
Where is it?
I don't know where it is, I haven't marked
Well you've got so many piles of papers lying around!
They're not mine there, those are all yours!
Here it is.
Here it is.
Here it is.
Where?
I've got my glasses on, I'll do it, I'll read it.
.You can't see without your glasses.
I can't.
There, Blagden, there.
It's at the top.
Where?
I've marked it at the top.
Some time 
Oh yeah.
in May.
May the what was it?
You ca you can't see it.
I can't see at  oh right.
Well I can see there alright.
Wait a minute till I switch on the other light.
I'll tell you it's 
It's cos it's written on blue paper in tiny print.
it's the third of May.
Daffodils  and arboretum
And there's a coffee bar.
products, plant and cake stalls.
Suitable for wheelchairs.
Well that's what I was thinking.
Toilet for disabled.
Yeah.
Tea with home-baked scones and cakes.
Open from one till  five .
Mhm.
It still isn't a lot of time if you finish work at quarter past three, and you're not home till 
I'm, I'm a half day, I finish at twelve.
Oh!
Oh!
Right.
Oh that's okay then.
I was just thinking if we take her out that afternoon.
Sunday, May the third.
In fact, I was  there's a  I'm going to suggest that we, we take some of the patients er  and early about  when is this?
It's in June.
Well do you want to go  take some of the other patients that day and I'll go as an escort?
Well on the twelfth of June my  Age Concern are having  er, a fair at Blagden Hall, all day that day.
On when?
The twelfth of July.
So on Hazel's birthday.
No, that's twelfth of June.
Twelfth of June, your Hazel's birthday.
What's the twelfth of July?
I've no idea.
It's the twelfth of July is last year the er 
Fourth of July's Independence Day.
it's the twelfth of July of last year they  had one.
No, that's the fourteenth of July.
I don't think anything's the twelfth of July.
No.
It's the fourteenth of July is Bastille Day.
But, anyway
And what are you that day?
I'm on early.
All earlies.
Ordinary early?
Quarter past three early?
Oh, well, I say I'm on early but  I will be, I could be an early or a late.
So that's
So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were on duty?
Well, for pa most of it  or part of it.
But I could organize that.
And, if  what they call it?
Is that a Sunday at Easter?
It's a Sunday.
If they can actually let me know  whether that bus is available or not
You're not gonna drive that bus are you?
I didn't say I was.
But, Mr  has got a P S V licence.
I don't know if I can drive 
Oh!
the bus or not, it depends  we'll have to see.
And does he, does he drive the buses?
Er, the hospital bus like 
No.
that?
No.
No.
He's never driven.
He's not down as a  as a driver for the minibus now.
But he's got a P S V licence which is a different thing altogether.
Yes, but, if he was willing to drive in his spare ta time, he would have his name down surely?
Wouldn't he?
Well one would have thought so, but I said to er Mrs  you see, about the minibus, no not the minibus, the M S bus being available  and, I said the problem was  or maybe  that we'd have to have drivers who have had a P S V licence, or what they call it?
It isn't a P S V license now, it's  very different type of licence.
Well whatever it's called.
But it's the same thing.
Yeah.
And she said, oh my husband's just renewed his.
So he could drive and so there'd be no problem she says.
But he's never ever, as far as I know  offered to drive the minibus.
Does he work?
Well
It sounds, it sounds odd saying, oh my husband's just renewed his, it makes it sound as if he hasn't had a P S V  erm  licence for a while.
I don't know.
Cos if he was working, and driving  he wo it, surely he would have automatically renewed it?
I don't know.
So it sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while.
They used to have some sort of test on that .
So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before.
If he didn't have the licence, he couldn't.
Well yes, of course.
Except, he could have for the minibus of course.
Where's my knitting gone?
I think he had a pet shop.
Well he wouldn't need a P S V licence for a pet shop.
But, I don't know that he does now.
Unless you were a Pet Shop Boy  and were a roadie.
Mm mm.
I can't remember what line I was doing.
Well  because she  periodically brings the bird seed for the  the bird on the ward.
I'm sure he never .
Whether the business was successful or not.
I had a vague recollection  somebody said he had this pet shop at Blagden or som not Blagden er 
Blagden?
There are no shops 
not Blagden 
at Blagden.
Bury.
Oh.
Mhm.
But we could still take the minibus and just take  three or four.
Yeah.
Well that's an alternative.
But that will be a good day to go out on.
Mm mm.
But we could take my mother on the other one.
Yeah.
Or we could take  them periodically.
Could go out, well the next  then there's a queue a mile long.
I said no.
I said mark the ones on that thing.
you want to go to.
That's when I  
It's a bit far to take her to near Berwick.
I wasn't thinking of taking her there, I was thinking of taking you!
Oh.
Anyway, it might be too cold.
And Corn Hill on the Tweed's a bit far for you my love.
I was thinking about
There's Anwick 
cos you 
Howick at Anwick.
I was thinking of you going there.
Where's Hallington?
I dunno.
It tells you.
Does it not?
Oh!
Wait a minute.
Between Colwell and Kirkharl.
Mm.
Etaul Manor's open nearly every Sunday.
Wasn't it Kirk oh no it was Katheaton.
Was it Ka 
Where Capability Brown 
Yeah.
came from?
Yes.
That's right.
We never did find his house did we?
No.
If there's any
And there's nothing there !
if there's any  remnants of his house.
There was certainly no  indication of it anywhere in the village.
There wasn't even anybody to ask!
Nope.
But if you wanted to go to any of those, those I marked for my  days off, apart from the one to Blagden on a half day.
But I could go that day.
Cos it's no distance to Blagden.
The others we'll take
We could walk there.
Tt.
Aye, it's three mi it's over four miles, it's  I haven't got the street map, it's about four miles.
Well we took your mother and we  that time.
Yeah.
Perhaps we'll get the bus there.
And then, in those days there was a bus service that way.
I don't think there's a bus service running that way now.
Isn't there?
Nope.
To get to
Well how many houses are on that road?
There's only
Well there's a fair number.
Actually on the road itself there's  well there is a fair number.
There's quite a few in the estate itself.
Quite a few houses down 
Yeah.
the estate.
Tt.
Did you tell me  what did they call the one who lived there?
That worked with you.
Near the road there?
Yeah.
Di 
She got .
Oh that's right.
Where is she?
Well er, she's at home, or she's in the erm R E I 
I used to see her in the hairdressers sometimes.
while the death is being investigated.
And she  she went into the R E I, with a query  stroke.
I know.
I remember that.
A query  I think she had a query lump on her breast or something, er lump or something.
And  they transferred her to the, the Cottage  and she did quite well, and she was home.
And whatever lump it was  they said wasn't anything to worry about.
But then  it was virtually  er  clear again, she was saying  but she has a brain tumour.
And whether they can operate .
Mm.
Oh dear.
She was nice, she was a nice woman.
But he retired early, of course, because of his  bad knees.
Mhm.
He couldn't  well he was the  head gamekeeper for Lord .
Yeah.
And er  the dampness and the  tramping all over the  rough ground and what have you, wasn't good for his knees.
Mm.
He   came from all over  Macaw or somewhere down there  he came from.
Mm.
Didn't know that.
And when he came out of the army  you know, after the war  er  he didn't want to go.
Well, I think, I don't know if they went back to the pits and sort of left, but he didn't want to stay there and  and got this job as a gamekeeper .
. He had a stroke.
They say that if you, if it wasn't for the shooting  we wouldn't have any grouse or pheasants cos they wouldn't be preserved.
they  they'd be  on a farm if he wants.
The grouse apparently it would.
I nearly stood on a grouse once, when we were walking up  I wasn't walking with you, it was when we were with the Footpath Society.
Got the shock of my life!
I was walking along talking to  Mika I think  and it just shot up from in front of me, I had my foot out.
It waited till the very last second.
Mm.
Well that's
I couldn't believe it!
Perhaps it decided to stay put and I wouldn't notice it was there and maybe at the last second it decided it would  run for it!
Well we nearly  when I was up with the children at the to when I was 
Mm.
and it went up into those  they were coming down in the minibus  and er  we stopped  so the I can't remember where we stopped.
Anyway, it was a good job we did because these  erm  these grouse and these chickens, I mean, they were so blended in with the  the, the  roadside you could hardly see them, and then they moved.
As we were coming down so slowly, and I think  we stopped suddenly  cos then they walked across the path.
You couldn't, you co you couldn't see them when they were on the roadside, you know on, on the  whe when they moved 
Mm.
onto the actual track like, so
Mm.
And Joy got the red squirrel so, at er   when I was out.
Well Edith told me  that erm 
Or was it Kenneth saying?
as soon as she bought her house  do you know which is her house?
Yes I've been to it.
What did you go there for?
To deliver something for you.
Oh maybe, a Christmas 
Can't remember what it was.
card it would be.
Cos that, the, you know the le 
But that's not where we saw the red squirrel.
you know at the left hand side of her house they've planted some trees.
That's out the back there.
Yeah.
But there was already  no.
It's at the  oh!
It's out the back.
No, the back of her house opens  has erm
Goes out onto the spri the spring head itself.
The back of her house, the back garden  erm, faces onto a field.
There's the fence
Mm.
o over the fence from that, er, the back garden  is the field, but
That leads over to the 
 
other side of the house.
but to the left of their house, when you're facing the front door to the left
Whe you mean when you're outside 
the there are some trees 
or inside?
Outside.
There are some erm  trees there
Mhm.
there was already  quite a few trees there, it was like a small wood  and they've plan and 
Well it is, that is.
they've planted some extra ones.
I think they've planted some 
That's the spring .
fruit trees.
It's a huge garden!
So they've got a 
But we were 
wood in it
I know but up there 
but from the time they moved in she noticed red squirrels.
Oh we didn't walk that way, we went up  further down.
And erm 
I think she said she'd seen a badger as well.
Well it's quite possible, yeah.
In the  from there onwards, you know,we there's nothing.
No.
You know,a after those houses 
Yes I mean, that's right.
th er the, there's fields until you get to  the Irish Sea, int there?
Just about.
Well yes.
But there's a few odd houses, a few odd villages, which are only small, but there's nothing much really.
When you re walk, going west it's countryside all the way.
Mhm.
Well
She's gone to California, Edith.
Has she?
I met her  erm
On holiday?
Yes.
I don't know if she's gone alone or with some, or with a friend, but er  she said she wanted to, she'd never been to California  and she wanted to go  before she was too  old and crotchety to get there  because David's  he's in no fit state to go anywhere any more.
So why, what 
So she asked, she asked if sh her sister-in-law  cos Sheila's living er  near her daughter.
And did er
Well,so 
Near Berwick or something.
and somewhere near Berwick, yes.
Ladyki no they moved from Ladykirk into Berwick I think.
And Sheila, erm
Mustn't forget these.
Oh, your glass where've you, have you picked your glasses up?
Got me glasses up yes 
Seeing as you frequently forget them 
do you want some posters for Gordon and Adam, well I can only lend you a couple of ones, but those might do if she turns them over
What?
those there, cos those are the ones I had for the European elections
Oh 
So did you say the yellow leaves on this umbrella tree are due to 
If they're not, if they don't, if it doesn't get sufficient light, the leaves turn all green
Green, right, so in actual, so that would
it's proper name's erm, er Schefflera 
Schefflera 
Schefflera something like that
so those have been getting plenty of sunshine, light
Yes 
and those haven't
if it's been standing on the floor though, only the top leaves would, I don't know what to do about having it there though, that's right above the radiator, it'll dry it out that's, that's why I said 
Well that's where the first one was 
do you think we should stand it on some gravel in the saucer there's plenty of gravel 
You can do you can do
oh I'll go and put some in after, when you've gone to work
but that's where the other one, that first one stood, remember when you first got it?
Yes, but when we first got it the radiator wasn't on  it was the summer time
Oh
it was erm  it was bought for us in July ah July

can't remember which July

It didn't, we took it in the front room

I looked at, it looks a good little shop does that 
I don't know, I mean unless you
it's a daft place to have an antique shop isn't it, where there's no other shops?
Well, it's a long way down I know this erm
It's, it's
it looks like they'd have lots of good stuff in
erm  some of it is, but I mean, some of the things like that washing machine from about
Oh aye
nineteen ten by the look of it
mm
and the great big  photograph of Queen Victoria  but they do have some nice things in, some of the crockery was quite nice 
Expensive though isn't it?
I don't know, I've never been in it, I've just looked through the window and then they've got junk, I mean that, that er 
And they've not got prices on them neither 
that erm modelled bull
Aye

Been in?
Er, no, there's Joanna one of the girls I look after and er Rebecca who lives next door to me, erm  some friends of ours years ago were going to, were thinking of buying it, it was about five thousand pounds then, so it shows ya how long ago it is 
 
er, but it needed quite a few repairs doing to it
just from a quick glance it looked like it would need some er work on it
it had one of those 
 
it had, erm  one of them cast iron baths you know in the middle of the bathroom with the sort of er  curly legs, Queen Anne type legs on it 
Remind me that  
they said it was very nice, but, the, they reckoned then it needed about another five thousand pounds spending on it
Just think you'd be laughing now if they'd spent that five grand on it 
Oh yes, yes 
Shall I get out my side?

I, I know the last time and I was reading all me pamphlets that came through  and I thought why, you know, but a lot of them I dunno  it's hard to know who to vote for I think

Have you talked to a nurse recently?
The nurses always complain, they were badly paid 
Oh 
this that and the other
just talk to them, just so short staffed, I don't know when Jim last got off duty on time
Aye, they're short staffed
the last time he should have finished at quarter to one he got off about half past one  mm 
So is that because they could  they won't take on any more?
They can't, because of all the wards that are closed, because there aren't enough nurses
I'm, I'm sure there's plenty of people who want to do nursing  and a lot would be for the erm
They can train, there's plenty training, but when you've finished your training there's nowhere
There's no
there's no jobs, look at erm Sunderland

And do you think you'll like it?
Dunno
I'm sure you will
Cos she starts the middle school in September, it's just the sort of running in 
 
you know they take them for a little visit so they get used to the school before they go, which is a good idea, I mean we were just thrown in
Aye, we was, yeah

Were schools smaller when you were at school though?
Yeah
It was certainly, the grammar school

I went to only had er  there was about between twenty five and thirty in each year and there was only form for each year so I say 
Oh they were bigger the classes are bigger now
say there were a hundred and say, say there were thirty in a class, five forms is a hundred and fifty
There were a lot bigger than that, when I was at school
and er
Chris
there was about twenty  yeah 
there was thirty, forty in the class when 
there was two two hundred at the most and that covered fourteen small towns and small villages and mind some of them were very small villages 
Oh no, we had a  mind  were big classes
came from quite a wide area  way up in the hills  Airedale and all that area, at the foot of the Cleveland hills
Well the high schools now they take them from all over don't they?
Cos they just have one 
I think there's thirteen hundred at the high school in Morpeth, well yes they come from Rothbury
Mm
in fact there was one boy Les, Les   actually lived fifty seven miles from the school  he lived er, what was his address?
Something, his father was a shepherd, his mother actually did bed and breakfast, she was on television about five years ago, she'd actually got electricity  I think it was 
Oh
erm both he, he became a shepherd when he left school as well, erm something 
Look will you leave it?
was Pennine Way was his address
That's why I move you so you wouldn't  
but, he actually lodged in Rothbury well that was fifteen miles to come each day 
What when he was at school?
When he was at school, but he used to go home for the Christmas holidays and nobody saw him again till about March cos he was, he couldn't even get to Rothbury he was snowed in.
It doesn't seem very
It would of just, it would have been, if he hadn't been that he, you know that he had to go to a school in Northumberland, he was just as near
I think I am  
or possibly nearer to Scottish  well he went home at weekends 
 
It's, it's just the same as the kids from er, say erm 
that's you she's talking to mum
I know that just looking

That's her excuse 
I think I've got them in 
Oh I will have one please, thank you

Well they're good for dry throats aren't they?
Mm

It's just me paper I'm marking me rose on
She wants a sweet

What is that supposed to do?
That's supposed to be a picture of your intestines, that's your stomach  that's your duodenum 
Everybody alright?
Yes, we're alright as we'll ever be
that's your
When Jim and me mum sitting watching the football 
that's your large intestine that's your small intestine 
oh we can watch the football I don't know what er Sunderland's on this afternoon, semi final of the cup
Doesn't look very nice does it?
says to Jim what if they get through do you know what  for Wembley 
Is it ?
to go and see them 
mm, mm 
he says I've been to Wembley 
on the on the wrong side
I says I know, you haven't been to see your team here, he says right once you've been to Wembley the second time's never as good it's just that 
Mum you've moved me
I know because you, you were thumping me knee, I cannot knit with you close to us man
Why don't you move this Zimmer and sit on the seat?
What you doing?
And tell me what you've been doing all the week 
Well
Have you done anything exciting?
No
Well is that the way to have the chair?
No, I'll tell you how far the rain affected us personally, you know the, well the antique shop at the end of our road
Yeah
you know there are steps go up it
aha
behind it
yeah
well they go up at the side of it and down behind it
Down to the river?
down and there's a path goes along and it comes, it goes under the road bridge and it comes out at the foot bridge and it runs next to it
Aha
the water got up to the second step from the top, but, when, instead of turning right into my road if you'd keep straight on
aha
and go along the river, you know where the flood wall is?
yeah 
Mm 
that's called Bennetts Walk, Bennetts Walk was all flooded, that was closed off
mm
but that wasn't with flood water coming over, that was because it was coming up the drains, cos it couldn't drain into the river
ah, aha
so those houses were all sandbagged, but it, it got into some, the problem was that the, the road closed sign kept blowing down in the wind, I tried to stand it up but it was oh so heavy, I got it up, but it, it immediately blew down again, and
Well we went down
people couldn't see that it was water there
Oh
sort of going just a short way along and having to reverse back out again
I tell you how bad our one was, it was all over the road, this, the, the river line
mm
at 
from the 
goes up 
some, er when one of the
where the court is, where you used to play tennis
when the father of one of the children came 
it was right  
he said  has flooded
oh
yeah
and there's a house there, I think it's a farm on the corner and they, they always get it I mean 
When was this?
Last week with the rains
Thur er Wednesday and Thursday  the children I have before and after school at Goose Hill School, you know the one, the one near me, just the bottom of the road on the corner, that's had to be closed on Thursday because the boiler room had flooded on Wednesday and er they had to dry it out  and also the children from Newminster were told anyone living in the Middle Queens area go home 
And they closed that er school did they not?
I thought they sent them home cos the rains in 
They must send them home at erm they must of sent them home about quarter to three, because they got home at quarter past
I remember somebody came in at the shop and says the Newminster School had been sent home, but where, which school's that?
Is that the one round, down the bottom of your lane?
No Newminster is the one along Midford road the one in the same grounds at Chantry
Oh
if you were going 
Chantry school?
Yes
Oh, that's right up behind me
Yes, well, they, they, they thought it
oh I 
yeah, the, the, the erm, they share the same school gate
Aye
you go up along drive in and Newminster is on your left and Chantry is on your right, at, but I should imagine erm  I should imagine that quite a lot of Chantry School children would be sent home because they're for the children outside of Morpeth, you know they go there from  
yeah

I've got a pile of stuff in here anyway for you.
Have you?
Who's that from?
The videos, your children's videos
Ah right.
and er what else, oh and the Goldilocks book he didn't take home.
Right
I found that yesterday in the erm  doll's pram.
I was gonna ask a favour, if you don't mind for tonight.
Yeah?
Would you mind having the boys for about half an hour because I would like to get Bryony's hair cut.
I want about three or four inches off the bottom 
Mhm 
and I think she's gonna have an absolute screaming fit.
Where're you taking her?
Probably to the one at  Staffhill if I could have an, if I can get an appointment booked.
Yeah 
It's just that, well you can imagine what she's gonna be like.
But she screams so much when she gets her hair cut and she won't have 
I know.
it tied back.
So even though I'd like 
I still haven't given, that's reminded me seeing Shona there, I, I don't think I've given her that pair of trousers and the sweatshirt and I told her that I've got them.
I must look for them.
Right, so that'd be lovely if you don't mind having them after school.
Right, I'll get you these er
Oh I'll pick them up  if you like, cos I'm gonna go and see if I can get my shoes 
Alright, well I'll, I'll give you them now cos they're here in the car.
Oh right!
I've got I've got them with me.
That's erm the card with teddy bears on that Bryony wanted that she kept me 
Oh right last night.
she kept meaning to take home and kept forgetting.
isn't it?
It is, yes.
Oh she loved it.
She carried it all around on er Tuesday.
Right, there are your videos.
Right, thanks.
The children have been difficult this weekend I don't know what's a matter with them, I think they're just
Well, the er th they seem to  Richard seemed to cry a bit more or a bit easier, you know, if he bumped himself and Bryony, and I think it was, well Bryony it seemed to be a heavy cold that was making her feel miserable.
Yes
And I think maybe it was with all of them.
They were just slightly under the weather.
And Martin has taught them to say you stupid zombie.
Oh great!
Oh great!
I know, that's I'm really pleased about that.
Oh dear!
So James is going around calling everybody a stupid zombie.
Oh well, it makes a change from a  stupid idiot 
I know.
It's gonna be wonderful at nursery if he goes straight up to his teacher again.
Oh.
Oh heck.
Again?
Why?
You know when she told him to close the cupboard?
No.
At nursery?
No.
She was, he was going in her cupboard, Mrs  I gather he said you stupid idiot to her.
Oh dear!
Oh what a start on your first visit 
I know 
or  a good impression .
I know.
I think that's part of the reason why she said you've got your hands  full .
I heard her say you've got your hands full but I didn't know why.
Oh, hey.
And then with Richard having the screaming fits when it was time to go home.
Ah but that, that 
Very reluctant.
that was a good sign wasn't it?
He was screaming because he had to go  home .
Yeah but none of the them would sit down or anything like that so you know
Yeah, oh, no
I think she's got quite a   .
Well I mean that's what children are like.
Well  none of the others looked as young as them did they?
No, they're not.
I mean they're not even three, yet they're going to be the absolute youngest.
Joe who started, you know Debbie who's 
Yes 
got three boys?
Yes
Joe was er three at the beginning of February.
Well at that age a few months makes a difference.
It does yes.
Oh, how's your mother?
Alright, she's er quite 
She hasn't driven yo you round the bend yet?
squawking at each other because the kids have been so diabolical!
Oh!
Oh dear.
So I think she's got quite an impression of Trevor now.
I keep saying to her they're not normally like this.
Well they're not.
But if they're not feeling quite well what can you expect?
Mm.
I mean what do you feel like when you're not quite well?
Aren't you short-tempered and whatever?
Mm  
Oh I've undone me belt.

Do Winners sell them, do they?
I didn't know 
Oh yes but erm

I said I think she'll be at the hospital visiting her mother-in- law.
Yeah I was.
So when she went out I said Ann's probably back now and er she said well if I don't see her tell her I've been down 
Mhm

Yes, it was nice to see her wasn't it?
It was it was very nice and she said erm Edith's in America.
Well I knew that.
I met Edith the day before she was going.
Oh, right, right.

But Edith said to me 
He still comes down to  walks down

I haven't seen him Oh!
I said I haven't seen him.
Oh she says he does, he goes down.
I must've been out at the wrong time.
Cos he can't see, can't read for a terribly  
No

She said he's most upset because he can't drive any more, erm
Are you on your own?

Yeah, okay 
Right.
Are you going up the street?
Er yes I'm going to get these car mats.
Course.
I'm going as well, right.
Well if that's where I'm going to I wouldn't be able to get the triple buggy into that shop, would I?
Has it got double doors that shop?
It's only a small shop, isn't it?
Anyway,it's better to go today.
It's too far to walk them and it's, it's up hill  all the way in that, with that chariot  
on your own than push the buggy.
Yes.
Yeah.
Right, coffee's coming up!
Besides which, if I can't get any I'll have to think of something else.
Right, I'll go and lock me door.
I think it's the wet.
Which is Ann's?
You what?
Which is Ann's 
Which is mine?
without sugar?
The one on the .
That one, okay, right, oh!
How long has the kettle been on?
It's just been .
Oh right.
Oh might as well go and sit down then Ann, waiting for  blast off!
Ooh!
It is chilly, honestly and I don't want to put the heating on again.
I, I'll hold it off for the  I'm economizing on the 
Doesn't sound very hopeful.
Does erm Bob er m know a lot about growing plants and things as well as vegetables?
Oh yes, he, he 
I'm looking, I want somebody who knows something about gardening.
I'm trying to find out why one of our azaleas has turned up its toes.
Albert over the road will be the best one to 
Oh.
tell you that, cos he was erm, erm school
Oh.
grounds gardener.
He 
I'll try 
he would deal with shrubs more than, Bob hasn't got a, I mean he grows flowers and  
I know 
and things like that.
yeah.
Thank you.
Erm, but erm, I mean he nearly does know, but I mean Albert is 
Is it lit?
Mm mm Albert is the gard he, you know, really good gardener.
Er I mean he shows  
Well they're both in tubs, they're both planted in ericaceous compost which is what we were told.
Yeah
When we  fed them before the winter we gave them proper er  fertilizer for things that need acid soil.
Mm mm
I know they can be affected by wind and frost and it turns the leaves brown and kills off the buds, but why is only one affected?
And as soon as it's 
Are they different kinds?
Or 
No.
are they exactly the same?
They're the same kind exactly but they're different colours that's all.
They're both in, they're both in wooden half barrels.
But, but don't azaleas don't azaleas shed their leaves?
Erm I think some do  but some are evergreen and these are evergreen.
Oh!
Because I had one  in the garden here and we moved it actually when we, we took the er hedge out er to put the fence and the gate on er and we moved it somewhere else and it er it just died off.
Er but it used to er shed its leaves.
Well, yeah I think some do.
And I think you're supposed to prune a little bit, aren't you?
They're not big enough to prune yet.
They're, they're about er
But should you not prune them lightly to 
eighteen inches.
encourage new growth?you see 
No i it's er 
Albert going past, he's back and forwards to the garden.
It said in the gardening book.
It didn't say much about them.
Really it's about, you know, huge erm rhododendrons, it's only a little bit at the end of that.
But erm
I've got a book here.
you know that er polythene that's got wire netting in between it like a, like a wire netting sandwich with po with clear polythene on the outside?
We bent some of that round the windward side of the barrel 
Oh right yes a sort of  
and I, and tied a lump of string round it to keep it on.
So it's been sheltered from the wind.
Ooh unless the 
We've made sure 
cat's done something on it.
Oh God, next door's cats.
Er I thought I had one in the house yesterday I went, as Sheila was going erm  Jackie  was in her garden
Oh yes
and I was telling her that that was the daughter-in-law of Mrs  who lived there before 
Owned the house originally.
Graham did
Yes.
and er I'd left the front door and the inner door open and
It don't switch off I'll have to go and do it.
oh, and er the cat was lurking around  however, it had gone somewhere else.
I can't
Oh gosh!
I've done it full!
Oh never mind I'll drink half of it.
Yeah, azaleas.
It's a weak one anyway, Ann.
It just says, where is it?
Lime-free soil plus large quantities of peat or leaf mould.
Some shade during the heat of the day .
Er it doesn't get any.
Erm when the sun's at the hottest anyway it's sheltered it only gets, oh and the other thing is, you, er it, it doesn't say here but you're supposed to, it's supposed to be somewhere where they'll be sheltered from the early morning sun if there's been 
Oh!
a frost.
Oh we've had frost we haven't  any early morning sun  anyway.
Thank you.
They said your azaleas reach five to eight feet.
it doesn't say, does it?
I gave it some water cos I 
They might be different types, you see.
One might 
Yeah but 
you see what I mean?
I know it's, it's just turning up its toes.
Oh!
Dear, dear.
How much are car mats, Paul?
I think they're within the region of two quid each up to about five pound each.
Mm I can afford that.
Evergreen Azaleas.
Mostly small plants three to four feet high .
Is that what you've got?
Yes they are small cos I got them 
Small dark green leaves,
to go in these half barrels 
flowering prolifically May and June.
Mostly hybrids.
Forms of  azalea.
Look for the  hybrid  flowering June July.
Exceptionally hardy but needing shade..
Well it's against the garage wall.
Mostly very hardy, large flowers, pink  no pruning needed.
Propagated by layers.
It said in my book just tidy them up if you, you know, if they needed a bit of tidying up.
planting out  .
No, it doesn't say any more than that.
No, it doesn't say 
That's more or less what it said in my book except erm they need to be shaded from early morning sun if there's been a frost.
Well we've had plenty of frosts but there's been no early morning sun.
I know there's been wind
Oh there's been a lot of wind  
but er 
which probably is bad as a frost.
Yeah
Have you got them in separate containers?
Yes.
Ah yes, I think you told me.
And the, they're beside the garage facing towards the kitchen
Mm  oh they're sheltered 
and the sun always comes along the side of the house.
I can tell because me, me washing always blows towards the gate, to the back gate
Mm mm
right?
Mm mm
Erm  so that must be, that's south over there isn't it?
Mm mm
Well it should be a south wind, it's not even a north wind.
That's west  that's south
Yes, that's right.
No
Hang on.
That's west, that's east, that's north
Wait a minute,wh which, which direction's Scot oh me nose.
that's south, that's south, that's south
Yes.
that's south 
Well it's coming  along the side of the house along there.
Yeah, but that'll be like a tunnel, you know, when the wind's blowing because the wind hits our front 
Yeah 
windows and is it the one er nearest the front that is 
Yes.
Oh yeah, no
But it's only about er  what's in between the two barrels?
Th the,th you know that erm small cauldron with er primroses in?
Mm
That's all that's separating them, I mean they're close together
Yes, but different plants respond differently to  
and it's not big enough to shelter the other one and the other one looks perfectly healthy.
Mm  unless you've just got some disease.
Good cup of coffee that.
Eh?
I said it's a good cup of coffee that.
Oh!
Thank Paul 
Thank you Paul!
It's the one coffee I get made per day.
I get one in the morning and then at night.
Well he makes tea at night.
He makes a cup of tea at night and that's his effort.
So er Sheila  was saying that erm  Andrea's in Lon er Bath.
Oh!
Erm I said what's she doing she says she's gonna do archaeology.
Oh yes now 
But she said she's only, she said she's twenty one and she said 
I think Edith 
she's got no A levels yet.
Well what about erm Kathleen's Jenny is seventeen!
I know, I know and she's coming to Newcastle
Yes
erm University
Yeah
cos she said she'd just bought a flat 
Mhm
she's gonna lend to them.
Erm but I mean I thought Andrea was going in catering and she says well that's what we hope.
We thought that would be best for her  
Oh yes she was very keen wasn't she when she used to come and stay with her Grandma?
But she says she's now wanting to do archaeology erm but she says she hasn't got any A levels!
You can't do that without A levels.
So she says I don't think she's really capable of getting any.
So she's just left 
Yes
Andrea
Yeah  oh 
So she says Graham erm forgot the name, what do they call him?
And Jennifer's doing er did she say history and politics?
Oh right is she doing history and poli oh 
Aha, yeah 
Erm Gillam, he's working for some er publishers in London.
Mm so he must be twenty
Oh he'll be
four, five?
Yes I think, cos he's through university.
Oh and is Ann still in Kenya?
I didn't ask her any of it.
Yeah she's in Nairobi, mhm
Er yes
Nairobi and she says they come across, she comes across occasionally.
They were gonna let the house.
Well I thought Edith said she came across at Christmas cos if you remember, we've always sent her Christmas cards to her house in, near Harrogate haven't we?
That's right, yes, yes.
Well we didn't know where else to send them.
No.
Cos she said 
But I'm sure 
she'd gone for a couple of days when she was up but she says she hasn't been up to see her for about eighteen months!
You know when er the fir when we went up to Edith's, when she'd first moved in, for 
Yeah 
coffee?
Mm
Didn't Edith say then that Ann came across for Christmas?
To be with the children, mm 
Well that's two years ago!
Isn't it?
Oh yes it will be.
It it wasn't last  well, it'll be nearly two years 
No she's be erm Edith moved in was it January or February?
January.
That's right because we got a card in the, in our Christmas card saying that they were moving back to 
That's right.
Right.
and er they hope to be in by January the  something?
I knew it was January
Yeah, oh  cos that's when she said Frank, Frank only came for a short while or something?
Yes
So he doesn't have to pay taxes.
I mean they must find they must find it expensive because I mean if they're keeping that house on  they have to have somebody going in to look at it, won't they?
And they'll have a home in Nairobi.
Yes.
Still it must pay them, must pay them to do that.
Oh  what's Paul doing?
Perfectly honest I don't know he spends a lot of time  in there .
Oh I wa I was wa 
I don't quite know what he does sometimes
I was watching for him erm I'd been to the loo and I glanced out the er landing window and I thought it looked too tall for you.
I thought it was his shape moving behind your kitchen net curtain and er I thought oh I'll dash and ask him now about those car mats so I can go and get them.
Well I, tell him what kind of car it is.
Yes.
Erm
Well this is, this is why I thought perhaps erm  I didn't want to ask Jim too much or he would know I was buying them for him you see.
That's right yes.
And I remember this time in Winners when he, he picked them up and looked at them and said I don't think these are the right ones for my car and that, that's why I thought 
They were too small you see, weren't they?
and I was thinking where on earth is there a shop in  that sells, sells things like that or do you have to go to a garage and I'd forgotten that that fruit 
Yes 
shop was one now.
Yes it's, it's very useful actually.
I've been up there buying things for him in the past when he was er operating the taxi and he hadn't time to go himself.
Yeah
And er if they haven't got it they'll get it for you.
They're very good.
Mm 
Yeah
You mean if they haven't got any I'll have to make a model.
I bought him one Christmas years and oh hey, we were just married and I ordered him an extending ladder from the Co-op
Mm
and I ordered it in November, it finally came in February.
So I bought 
 
him something else for Christmas, something smaller and I made him a model out of matchsticks and I said this is the prototype 
Oh my 
of your Christmas present!
I 
goodness!
That would need some concentration 
I, I just sort of made erm two short ladders about two inches long.
Oh right.
I think I did it with a pair of tweezers to, so I could stick the 
 
matchsticks together and then I stuck one half on top of the other to make it look like an  extending ladder .
 
Yes
When is his birthday then?
Er Wednesday.
Oh right, right.
So he's er an April  erm birthday?
Yes.
Mm
He's always telling me all the best people are born in April.
Well my, my  vary.
Jennifer, she was born on April Fool's Day.
I think that must 
Oh yes.
be awful being an April Fool.
I'll tell you who else is the first of April as well.
Mrs  at this end of the old people's bungalows.
Oh yes!
I know who you mean.
I see he er the son's re er well he hasn't retired he's er given notice that he's not er going to be on the market committee now.
Oh I saw your photograph in the 
Oh
Did you see it?
I'll tell you why he's probably not going to be on the mar market committee because his daughter had a
Yes he said 
jewellery stall.
he said there's been a lot of erm talk about his daughter and erm son-in-law having a stall and  is one of the markets where he intends to trade in and erm he thinks 
This is 
that the  he'll be sort of for a right.
She's on the council, the town council, his daughter.
Is she?
Fiona  yes.
According to Jim she's never opened her mouth and said a single thing yet but er
She turns up?
Yes.
Well I suppose he's had a lot of flack, I mean look at the
Well he says that 
everyone says if you want a council house in  you've got to 
Well that's mentioned in the art was mentioned in the article as well 
you've got to join the Liberal Party and you've got to be related to Ian 
Erm he got a lot of flack 
But let's face it 
when he was on the housing erm 
well all his three children got houses at, at eighteen.
None 
Yes 
of them married
Yeah
and when  when this one who's got the market stall was pregnant
Mm
she gave up her flat and went to live with her mother.
Mm
When she was pregnant again, I think the father by then was divorced so she married him, she immediately got a house
Yes.
no, she had a house to start with.
When you think of all the families on the waiting list 
I know they're waiting  
and single eighteen year olds being given 
Yeah 
houses it's, it's, they left themselves wide open for 
That's right well that was 
people to 
mentioned in the article as well about the housing committee 
Yes.
in the  erm  well  silly to put yourself in that predicament wouldn't it?
Mm
It's mad.
It is.
Stupid.
I'm going  
But remember when 
this afternoon  
Are you?
I've been 
Oh yeah 
we're having a salad to make.
That's what he's doing in the kitchen washing the, cos Paul says if you're back late I'll be having my dinner before you come, I says okay.
I forgot to check wha if Jim's got a meeting tonight.
If he has I've got to think of something to cook  that he can finish off cooking so he can eat it before I get back from aerobics so I can stick mine  in the microwave to warm up .
You warm it up?
You warm it up?
Yes, I mean it 
mhm
it doesn't need to be absolutely freshly cooked.
Yes.
No this is why I ca I don't know if you remember, but erm she was interviewed by a reporter, Fiona  and she,i when the market traders were all on strike and you know all those months the  
 
er and there was only the two fruit stalls there
Yeah.
and occasionally the fish st well
Yes.
yes occasionally three fruit stalls and one fish stall, she said er the market, the market hadn't ceased trading, trading, it was perfectly healthy it was doing very well!
Cos I thought, I 
 
thought where have you been?
I mean there had been how many?
Ninety was it?
Yes.
Sometimes a hundred.
Mm mm
And er four stalls at the most there and according to her it was perfectly healthy and there was nothing wrong with it.
I thought, and then I happened to go, Jim came to carry the fruit and vegetables for me and when it had opened again, and there was she with this, I looked at Jim and I said ah!
That's why she said that she's got this jewellery stall.
Oh!
I didn't know what stall, type of stall she had I just read about it in the paper 
I haven't had a proper look around the market for  I looked 
I went down
I looked at the buttons next to the fruit stall because what I usually do I go and get the fruit and vegetables, if Jim's on the right shift he takes them home, otherwise I buy them while it's quieter, the man keeps them for me, I go straight across the leisure centre to soft clay cos it's only open on Wednesdays and then on the way back one of them walks
Oh you put them in the pram.
and I put the fruit and  vegetables in the buggy  and we come straight home cos it's time to eat by then.
Mm mm
I'll have another cigarette and then I must dash.
Yes I'm going to the street and getting an early lunch and getting myself organized for  going out.
What time are you to go up?
Well half past two I usually erm
Dorothy was telling me  this morning  you know when we were at erm nursery?
Mm mm
That's lit erm  I heard Mrs  you've got your hands full there.
Dorothy told me why.
She'd er Mrs  had asked James to close the cupboard and he called her a  stupid idiot .
Mm!
Yes.
Oh that's gone out.
Oh my!
And now Martin's taught him to call people stupid zombie so Dorothy's not pleased.
Oh dear!
He's not going to be very popular with her help at .
Oh he'll soon get out of it.
I mean they, they settle down, they settle down  
Yes.
I mean it's good for them learning to be amongst a lot of children and they soon learn that erm they can't have their way.
Well her boys are quite amenable really but erm
Bryony is the one 
Bryony you know
Mm
the tantrum screaming carries on when she doesn't want her coat on to go out.
Yeah.
I had a bit 
I mean 
of that with Joshua last 
if she 
week and he's got to the stage now where don't want to
Yes.
and he starts crying if you insist erm and you have to be pretty firm with him
Mm mm
and won't say anything er go away, go away 
Yeah Bryony went if you, well she's not so bad now she's got over that phase where she refused to have her coat on, but if you're trying to get her ready erm and she doesn't want to get ready, she'll say either go away or don't do that to me if I'm trying to get her coat on.
Oh dear!
The joys 
And and James sometimes says I don't want to hear that!
 

Well  she says it's not her and I don't remember saying that.
Oh!
Oh well, it must be you then.
I mean, no if he says something that I don't like I usually say oh that's not very nice is it?
Mm
But if er  if I'm s if I say to him you're not, you're not eating properly, sit up and, you know,pu bring your plate near to you
Mm mm
I don't want to hear that!
Tt oh!
Well, won't be long now before they're in school, another, another year?
A year this summer?
Erm they'll go a year in, wait a minute.
They'll go a year come September, won't it?
Yes.
April, May, June, July, August, September they'll be four in five months
Mm mm
by then.
Gosh it soon passes, doesn't it?
When you think it doesn't seem five minutes ago
Ee I know.
It seems when you first had 
that the tiniest 
them it, it seemed ages before they were going to be on their  
Well they was 
going to school.
well James especially, the, the tiniest Baby-gro
Yes.
his feet came down to the knees on it
Yes .
and they had Bryony in, I'm sure it was a doll's dress
Mm mm
you know when they were two days old, Trevor took me through to the hospital 
He's not working!
Who?
Erm Shirley's husband, Jimmy.
That's funny.
Cos I've seen him about a lot.
Jim said that to me yesterday and I said isn't he on holiday?
Well he seems 
That, that
to be having a long holiday!
Jim said to me last night  is er Jimmy   h is he not working?
No!
I've just seen him go past.
I thought, I wonder if you knew cos he's been about a lot lately.
I haven't noticed.
Mm yes he's been 
Oh!
going out with the dog rather than Shirley.
Oh.
I wonder if erm Shirley's sister's working because she often meets her  nieces  yes her nieces from school and she has her nephew with her, you know, Judith's.
Oh!
Do does her sister live here now?
No I
Cos didn't she leave her husband?
Oh she remarried.
She's 
Oh has she remarried has she?
she's got, yes, have you seen her
No I haven't 
eldest daughter,
I don't know 
Ruth, you know the one I used to look after?
Well, when she first left her husband she moved in with Shirley 
With Shirley yes.
and er how did they all fit in that house?
I don't know  
Cos there was Shirley and Jimmy, and Ann and Sarah, and Judith, and Ruth and Christopher, and Christopher was  was Christopher nine?
Or was he at  road, by then?
Erm Ruth was definitely at Goosehill School.
She's very tall, very slim and very, very attractive.
She's really pretty.
Mm I don't know 
And Christ Christopher's six foot something and a very handsome young man.
And does her sister work?
Well this is what I was wondering because
Mm  
because Shirley seems to have been looking after, anyway she married this  Robert
Mm
apparently she used to go out with him before she married  Derek, I think her first husband was called.
And now she's got er Rona and Sophie  I can't remember the boy's name.
So she's got six children altogether?
She had three to her first marriage.
I can't no, she's got Ruth and Christopher, Judith's the mother 
Oh!
Oh right.
She's got Ruth,a Shirley's Ann, to me, looks more like Judith than she looks like her mother.
Oh right!
Yes.
Except of course, Ann's blonde and 
Yes.
er  Shirley's black, or it was.
She seems to have gone very grey very quickly.
Oh!
You know, really, really quickly.
Well I, I suppo this is her sister you're talking about?
Mm mm.
No!
Shirley herself.
Shirley.
Oh I hadn't noticed it 
Yeah, her sister's got slightly lighter hair than, than Shirley had.
I do I don't know her sister much.
But I think they live at Pegswood.
But the other thing is, Judith's husband plays  in a band  now  I'd, I th it might be a pipe band, I'm not sure
Oh!
and he travels arou they go  or is it a  band?
I don't know , erm but he sometimes goes abroad with it I think, but he, he goes to different parts of the country and Judith goes with him.
I know erm when there was only Ruth and Christopher  before Judith had Rona, they sometimes used to come and stay with Shirley.
I would think it would be easier for  Shirley to go to their house  to look after them now.
I'd have thought so, yes, yeah.
But I think, I think 
Does, does the boy come to this, the, the girl come to this school?
No, erm the little ones?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh and they live at Pegswood, do they?
Well
I just think they might  
I wonder well they did, they certainly were living in Pegswood, but I've noticed when they bring the children to school the car frequently comes along the river way.
Oh they must live down there somewhere or maybe  I mean 
So that to come  that way
they've gotta be, they're coming from the bottom of Bennet's Walk or from
Or from 
Courts  street 
or from up the hill or somewhere, yes.
Mm
Or unless they come from Stobb Hill and come by the station and over the crossing.
Well that means they've gotta come over the crossing.
I know but it's, it's sometimes
Gotta be quicker!
it's sometimes very difficult to 
The traffic!
turn into Goose Hill off erm
That's right
off the main road.
Right, I'd better go and get ready and go and get those car mats.
Well make sure you get the right ones.
I know.
Ask, can these be changed if they're not right?
 
Keep the bill.
Yes.
Keep the bill.
I'll take the jars.
I've got some jars there's s bottles and things for the erm
I've got milk bottles that I, you know, when I bought the odd bottle  
I've still, oh 
and I don't know wh how to get rid of them!
I've still got one milk bottle left.
Well I've got three because sometimes they, they haven't got milk in the Co-op and they haven't got milk in the, in Iceland
Mm
I call at Louie's and he 
Oh!
had bottled milk.
I didn't know they sold them.
Yes!
Yes.
Erm so I've bought a few bottles and I don't  
Well take them, take them back.
Is there a crate there or what?
Take them back there.
Oh I never thought!
Yes, I never thought.
That's an idea.
I wonder if that has, does that milkman still come round here?
Has he got any  customers left ?
I don't  I think he does, I think he comes late at night, Paul er said cos sometimes he's up watching videos or whatever
Oh I've heard the milkman 
erm 
I've heard bottles rattling early in the morning but I, sort of one o'clock, two o'clock but I hadn't 
cos I was sort of lying in bed sort of late 
noticed who it was 
one night when Paul came up and I wasn't asleep and I saw like  this bright light
Mm
and Paul was coming up the stairs, I said is that the police, is that a police car?
And er  he said no, it'll be the milk, it's the milkman, he comes at this time.
So it must be that one
Mm mm
because the other chap comes about half past eight in the morning, nine o'clock.

erm, I'll get, have I got time?,
I've got time to do the potatoes before I go, erm
have they  around a bit?
she said yeah, she, erm, the reason that women who does the earrings couldn't make them for me, was that she buys all the parts, well the flower earrings she makes, she buys all these parts and she ex assembles them which ever parts you want
mm, mm
the colours and everything and the order you want them, but the little figures  erm, she buys them and she just paints them, and that's how she could make er the ones for Shirley er for me, erm  she gets little soldiers and she can paint them in the camouflage dress 
yes 
you know the, er the para smock and er 
with the red hat, and  she dyes the red hat 
but in, no it's not red, it'll, I think it's military police, erm, that's how she can do it with er, erm a maroon beret, because she said to me did I want a peaked cap? and I said no the, the er, erm maroon beret, so it shows its the parachute regiment
what, oh, erm, there's something I've just thought of though, when they wear the er camouflage things, is that when they wear the maroon belt round?, isn't the kaki belt with the dress uniform?
anyway she said, er Catherine said she was surprised that the woman couldn't do it for me, before the end of June
but Catherine, cos I didn't know Catherine sells stuff for her
that's nice
that's how Catherine gets such a lot of stuff by post she, she actually 
I know she does, she does

You're supposed to say, oh, no I don't.
And I say, oh, yes you do.
I don't!
And then you say, oh, no I don't like Richard does.
Yes, when you get a bit bigger we'll have to take you to a pantomime and then you'll be able to say that.
Right, shake.
Who's that?
Oh, just the boys playing in the lobby.
I think they're, I think they're

Wait a minute!
You're not going with wet hands.
Perhaps they're going back in their space ship.

Thought I heard Jim's voice.
It wasn't.
He said he was going delivering, he had a whole pile of stuff to deliver.
Oh.

You've done it before and your arms.
Er, let's, let's, let's do it again 
What are you going to do again?
They open the door and they say boo!look in the window at them 
Let's say boo!
Let's say boo!
You want to say boo as well?
Are you all going out and leaving me in here?
Don't, stop banging the door so hard!
Boo!
That's just what I need as well.
Just what I need all your filthy fingers and, and mouth marks all over the glass  top of the door.
I can see you from here.
You've got funny striped  faces through this glass.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!

Let's, let's say boo to Richard.
Listen who I can hear, listen.

She's not that way she's that way!
Well, aren't you coming to see your, come and say hello to your mummy!
Come on, say hello to mum.

how have they been?
James has been a James today.
Has he?
I could've throttled them after dinner.
Hello Richard!
Mum!
Hello.
They fought over everything they could think of to fight over they were really niggly!
Well James was.
I thought maybe he was getting the same as Richard and Bryony had had, but he's cheered up.
You've cheered up, have you?
You've been a monster today?
No 
 
You have been, James monster.
Have you been a Jimmy monster?
Yes, we had a carry-on at, at dinner-time.
He would not stop hitting, slapping Richard across the face.
Oh!
I don't like the sound of that!
So I, I made him swap places as, er, with Bryony and of course he wou he wasn't sitting there!
He was gonna sit in his own seat.
I said you can't cos you keep hitting Richard in the face for nothing!
You won't let him eat his dinner!
Was he, was he 
So 
naughty to you?
so Richard's crying because he'd been hitting him the face.
He's howling and scr w wailing cos I wouldn't let him go back in the same chair!
Have you got a proper cuddle?
So he ate his tea later  and then he said to me  I'm not gonna hit him any more.
He didn't at teatime, did you?
Good!
And then they just had the bikes and cars to  fight over.
Ee, what a mess they've left you, Ann.
Oh, we've been like this all, Amy and Richard tried to tidy it up.
Well I tried to tidy it up before we went to school and they were flinging it all out again and there just wasn't time!
Charming!
So, I shall do it when they've gone home and then I'll, at least I'll know,that it won't  it won't be being undone.
I wanna go in the car!
Is it Jim's birthday today?
Tomorrow.
Oh tomorrow.
Get your shoes on popsy!
Go in the car!
You can go in the car when Bryony's got her shoe on.
It's gone upstairs!
It's upstairs is it?
Whereabouts upstairs?
I've just put it back on her?
Are you not feeling well then?
Oh Richard, James, James said can I have the hairbrush out.
I said as long as you don't go near your sister.
  
I didn't want to hear everybody running round the hair, room screaming, not having my hair combed, not!
Have you got pretty hair now?
And he's chasing them with a brush and saying, come here, an absolute mess!
He said to her, not today this was a week or two back.
She's going  screaming, not get my hair done!
He says come here, come here!
You're an absolute mess!

There's your shoe!
I definitely have got a video.
Find your shoe.
We haven't got another video!
Well you said you had and I remember you had.
You've probably wiped it off now, by now cos it was ages ago 
I recorded one and he took it home and if Jim had recorded another episode on it I don't remembering him doing it.
Because you took the recording 
 
home after
Sally was the one, or somebody wanted the other programme I put the tape in and recorded  
Yeah.
thank you and I gave it to Dorothy.
Mm.
Yeah, but there was another one  
Well I don't know anything about that!
Well that would make three and we've definitely have not recorded three because there were only two episodes to go when you were upset 
Come on  
because you were going to miss it.
And I 
That's right!
recorded it and I sent it home with you.
I didn't know Jim had sent another one, had recorded another one 
Have you got any others then?
The other one wasn't sent home it was kept here.

Unless one of them tipped it over.
Oh, it's here.
If you, Anne!
If I find it I'll  it but I, I don't know of any other recording.
Well it was  that one.
That's just Richard he likes to ring the door bell.
If it was someone else they're hardly likely to ring the door bell with Jim standing beside the front door, are they?
Get your shoes on, Martin, please, your mum's waiting to go home.
Are they here?
That's rubbish.
Puzzles forever.
 

Have you got your shoes on, Martin?

I don't really know what else I can do?
It's about eight times he's taken himself out.

I must sit down for two minutes, Jim.
Alright, sit down for three minutes.
I will.
I'll sit down for three minutes!
I need to sit down for three minutes or, me back'll snap in two.
Oh thanks, Hazel.
Now where's that 
consider how expensive those houses are in Rectory Park and Rectory Dean the roads are just shockers.
Are they?
Mm.
Well, are they not private roads?
Oh no,
I don't know.
they're unadopted roads aren't they?
I don't I've no idea if they're adopted or not.
Oh, where does this go?
Oh, I'll put them away later.
They go in the cupboard under the stairs.
Where does this go?
I was a late and I changed to an early and back to a late .
Well you wouldn't have been able to go if you'd been erm
If I'd been in earlier I might've gone and seen 
Oh I see.
Some of these puzzles, Jim, must've fallen down behind the erm fermenting bin.
Mm mm.
I just can't get close enough to see.
Some of these things as well, they've been pinching  back from upstairs, toys they, they've played with when they were smaller  and they don't play with them now and I put them upstairs out of the way and they keep going and finding them and bringing them down.
That was up, cos they don't seem to play with that much now.
So have you got all these things delivered now?
How many?
Where?
Which area?
Oh.
Where does that shape go?
So er  yeah the children from  school were singing in their Easter bonnets and Easter hats.
Oh, was there?
At the hospital?
school, yes.
Oh!
Is erm  Matthew at  Matthew 
I would imagine so  
Oh, well he wouldn't 
must be.
I can't remember how old he is.
Well the oldest one's   
Ouch!
 

When I want to sit down and have a cigarette I haven't got any.
Are you at a meeting tonight?
Yes, at half-past seven 
Oh,.
Do you want me to go up and get you some?
Yes please.
Oh, there's a piece of  I should imagine there's bits of puzzles under the chairs anyway.
Sure to be.
Oh!
at the match last night?
I saw, I saw bits and pieces of it.
Er  I was on duty 
Do you have any more work to do?
Well
When, when  
 
You could hear such cheer when they, when they got the goal.
Oh it was a great goal was that, wasn't it?
It was, yeah and erm there was only Jim and I watching, the dog was lying peacefully  then he jumped up  he started barking he didn't 
 
know what was going on.
Peter  selling er, er a ticket to go, he didn't watch it.
Jim says no, Kath's asked him if he would like to go but  he wanted to go down to Wembley er  get yourself away!
If you can, if you can get yourself a ticket.
Mm.
Er he probably thinks he could get one through  but he says no, I've been once.
But the second time, they tell me, isn't as good as the first time when you go.
 
She says, well it's your team!
Yes!
cos it wasn't Sunderland that he went to see when he got the ticket the last time.
I can't remember who he said it was  but erm   I've always fancied going  
So you get yourself down there, then.
Sunderland were there.
Oh.
I wouldn't have been bothered about any other  cos you see it better on the, on the screen.
Yes.
Yes, you do.
But you, you lose out a little bit on the atmosphere.
Yes.
Unless you can create your own atmosphere.
Well, that's it.
I mean you should have all your friends and neighbours in and have a party!
Well the last the last time when Sunderland got to the Final in seventy-three  er there were five of us in the, in my house and I'd made red and white rosettes 
 
we had our red and white rosettes and when our, I was sitting watching the match and when they scored the goal my slippers went up in the air.
And Jim er Bill grabbed the camera that was on the mantlepiece and he got a shot, not of me, but he got a shot of Pat and her friend and Bryan  and er, it was er, er, something I'll never forget.
Mm.
it really was  So erm  but I don't know, I, I think if Jim got a ticket, if he got two tickets and he said  do you wanna come?
I would 
Mm.
go like the shot but I, I certainly wouldn't go without Jim, without somebody else.
Mm.
But I'll have to get me red and white coat out again  
Well you wor work on, work on Jim!
I mean Pat said he can go so  tell him to get two tickets and you'll go with him.
red and white scarf  got plenty of other reds 
I don't know if er
I could, I could quickly get a Sunderland scarf, believe me, Ann.
Mm.
There's shop in  sells them.
Well our Nick used to have er a red, the red and white scarf and hat and everything.
He had a tie  there's drawers full of stuff upstairs belonging to him I don't know if there's anything in there.
Do you remember when we used to  
I knit him red and white stripe gloves.
yes.
red with a white tassel on it.
Mm.
Red and white scarf.
Mm.
Those were the days!
Yeah.
Well, you know, apart from anything else they always  they were prepared to give me free tickets for the  would never do that.
Yes, I know 
I mean Newcastle, we went to Newcastle and they showed us round the ground er  when there was no match on and we saw the trophies and the directors' box and various places like that.
But they wouldn't let us in, if we wanted to go the match we had to pay.
But er, Sunderland gave us free tickets, complimentary tickets not free tickets, complimentary tickets in the seats in the Grandstand!
Aha.
And er   were not cheap seats.
No.
And then we went round, you know where that  they had a training place at Washington?
We went round there and showed us all the way round 
Did they?
Yes er  yes cos er 
When they opened the ground at  a few years ago  Bill was still alive, and er we could go and visit, go into the ground and go and have a look round and it was open to the, the general public.
Er, he took me down  
it was the tunnel where they came out and all round there 
Well, we, we went in from the  
when there was a match on.
and we went in from the  end and er  down the pitch and in through the  saw the physio room and the, the changing room, baths  upstairs  saw the trophy.
Mm mm.
highlight in Hazel's life.
And when I, I mean when I, I actu actually felt quite emotional cos I'd not been to  Park to see a match for a long time and I mean we're living up here erm, and er, I just felt quite emotional when I got out and saw that lovely pitch it was in perfect   
Oh, it's immaculate, oh yeah.
Oh it was gorgeous!
It was in the summer, before the season started.
You haven't, you still haven't told me what this is made of?
What, oh that's 
Jim, will you go and g , what time does the off-licence shut?
The Victoria Wine.
Cos it's where,
Later isn't it?
Isn't it later?
it's where I get my cigarettes from the Victoria Wine shop.
this programme on.
And there's this  to start with.
Er, and Mo Mowlam, that's why I watched it cos Mo Mowlam was on    but anyway  all these nurses getting twenty thousand a year, staff nurses.
No, what, he was talking about taxation.
That's right.
And that er they would be worse off because he said even staff nurses are getting more than twenty thousand pounds a year.
Which of course charge nurses aren't getting anywhere near twenty thousand pounds a year and only a few  erm nursing officers.
Well it's nursing officers, you have to get into that bracket if you get twenty thousand a year.
Yes.
Paul was er telling all these nursery rhymes, nursery, fairy stories rather 
There's this, there's, there's, there's Hague  this Hague fellow who's a tory 
Hague is a 
you know, so I rang up to Anglia television last night in the programme and objected to this,
And of course he had the nurses' pay 
this lie!
scale in the other hand while he was ringing them.
Where's me purse?
make an announcement but no announcement was made.
There was no announcement made at the end of the programme so, and they never got back to me, so I rang this morning first thing and last night they didn't ask me my name and address, but this morning they did.
They got me name and address and telephone number at work and at home so  I told the unions that they had to write in and complain about it too.
Mm.
There you are.
Thanks.
and er  but what, I mean  
 
who was sitting in the audience who is a nurse  and er would've known and she would've been trying to get in and say this is not true.
But she did ask a question, she was the first question that was asked, the one about erm
Yes, but that's all very well but, bout, but er
it's too late then, that's what A Angie said, Angie said, you know they, they make this and it's too late you can't undo the, the, it's a lie!
That's right!
So there's half the country thinking staff nurses are earning well over twenty thousand are owning, earning over twenty thousand.
Your Pat said to me on Sunday while I was talking to her, she said, when she was saying oh well she doesn't know whether to vote Tory because
They've never been so well off.
she's done quite well under them.
As Jim said, in six months time if he's redundant she won't be feeling 
Yes 
the same.
it's true.
But she said, I said oh 
It was the La it was Will Owen and the Labour government that brought 
I said oh Pat just, just, I said have you spoken to a nurse recently?
You know, how demoralised they are and the state of the hospitals and things and she said, oh well, nurses er, they, they've always complained that they're hard up and,
And they always have been.
and the rest of it.
So, talk some sense into her will you?
Just point out that they might be redundant and
Well, if the Tories win, I mean the privatization will really go to town.
I mean even the trusts.
The ambulance men in Northumberland because it's a trust  and they're paid by the trust
That was another thing he said, wasn't it?
They, they 
That they privatized erm ambulance service, they're now the highest paid in the country.
Which is
and Jim, Jim's got their pay scale and, and
Well the trust  paying them 
They're being paid,
less!
they're being paid less than the N H S 
Than, than the N H S!
ones!
I mean just across, if they go down to Durham which is an N H S  ambulance service.
And that's, you know, anybody listening to that on the television would think, oh yes, that's true!
You know it's, it's 
over there and you er believe everything they've said.
once it's stuck in their head then it's like reading things in the newspapers.
What, what am I going for?
Cigarettes.
Er,fort well if you, if you manage to get to Victoria Wines in time er, get me erm,er twenty erm  no, get me forty er Emb what do they call them?
Elite, please?
If you've gotta go to the Co-op, just get me twenty of whatever's  there is.
Forty Elite?
If you get to the Victoria Wine in time.
I don't know if he will.
I don't know if it shuts at five o'clock or what they do  or if evening staff come on?
I've never tried to go after  five o'clock.
Mind you, Ann, I suppose that's why Pat got thinking about a Tory er vote.
No, she wasn't thinking, well she wasn't exactly thinking about a Tory vote.
She said, well I, I don't know what to do, she said, I haven't read, you know, she hadn't read the election, she hadn't had time to read the election addresses, and she's not really interested in ac actually so she hasn't watched it on the television.
And I said, oh Pat, you don't want a Tory government in a again, do you?
And she said, well, I I I don't know, she said, you know we've done alright under them.
What does she think's happening to education?
What does she think's ha happening to the hospitals?
I don't think, probably she hasn't really thought it, she's, she's been more concerned with her own self but she's .
can't, I don't know.
I'll have to have a talk with her.
Put your daughter straight!
I've, I've  I've often thought I would never vote Tory but, I mean, I've been better off in some ways in that I was able to buy my council house.
But that, as far as I can make out, is the only thing that I've benefited by, you know, with them being in.
Mm mm.
erm
The unemployed certainly haven't been better off.
The, the thing is 
The young people leaving school haven't been better off.
Well it would be erm, the number of people who are being put out of work
Yeah.
and it's not just every week or every month, it's every day, when you hear of jobs being lost 
That's right.
It's a, it's a  
And isn't it a hundred, hundred and, hundred and fifty small businesses go bust every year?
I mean they keep saying we've given the all, all these opportunities to all these 
a case in point 
small businessmen and there's a hundred and fifty.
She tried to get, she's tried to get started making, doing her own business, spoke to her the other day and she's, well, Pat spoke to her on Sunday and she got more out of her than I did
Mm.
but er, she's not getting 
No.
Paul next door left school, you know, he cou all he wanted to be was a mechanic, it's, it's all he's ever been, he's really good.
But he's learnt from his father
Mm mm.
and he couldn't a job and then, I me I mean, he tried for apprenticeships all over the place and other jobs and he just couldn't get one!
When his father died, when he was twenty- one, he took over the erm taxi business.
Well it was private hire, but most of the work came from Northgate Hospital.
Mm mm.
You know they, they ran, they took the nurses, because the nurses home was a mile or, was it a mile or a mile and a half or something from the hospital, they had this, they took them in the morning and then they took them at lunchtime and then all the different shifts coming on and off they took them, and they had the schools run as well.
And then, of course the er, they started running down Northgate hospital and they closed down the nurses home.
So there was half his business worked out, wiped out in one go.
And then erm, his schools run was way up into the country, quite a long way  and then that was changed.
First of all th the erm registration went up, then something else went up and then  two of his children from farthest away were moving so he was gonna be paid much less than that.
Well the ordinary private hire, there's so many of them, I mean his dad had been doing it for years but there's so many started up.

That's right it's in the bott the trees hanging the branch is hanging right down to the river and the moorhen's standing on it.
That's right.
But I can't see any more moorhens and there's usually a few more round if there's one.
But I can't see them.
Right then let's get in a line again.

We we can't go and see.
Listen.
Yes that's what kind's that one Bryony?
Bryony says she can see one in the sky.

I want to see the one in the park.
Yes it's a white one with a black head.
I want to see the one in the park.
You want to see the birds in the park.
The trouble is
I want to see the one in the park .
Yes but but I can't push this buggy up that very very very steep hill to get down the other side to the birds.
Isn't it beautiful.
I am.
I am.
They want to go up to the aviary but I I can't get I can't get this buggy up there up that hill.
I should think not either.
Listen we'll come
Another day.
Yes cos we we can walk easily
Yes.
We can easily 
lovely weather up here.
Oh I hope so.
Better than last Wednesday.
Oh yes.
You wouldn't think it was the same month would you?
Yes that's the weir.
I want to see the one in the park.
You want to see what?
But I've just explained about five times.
To go to the one in the park we'd have to go up that hill and there's no way I can push this buggy with Bryony in the front and all these fruit and vegetables I couldn't get up and the hang on to you two with your reins I couldn't get up that steep hill.
So the best thing to do the best thing to do listen.
No Bryony I'm telling you you listen I'm telling you.
The best thing to do would be to come tomorrow and we'll walk there without the buggy.
We can easily walk there and we can come in the front we can come in the front gates of the park and we don't have to go up great big steep hills do we?
