My head was going like this on the  .
He said I'll come up  he said if it's more than thirty pound Ange, he said you can give me some money next week.
Don't worry about it, get what you want and I'll fill this for you.
Thirty pound?
What do you mean  why he charging you to  do it?
Yeah I said cos I couldn't ask him to do for nothing.
Yeah well what are you giving him?
No I'm giving him a tenner.
I said I'll give you a tenner to build it all for me.
Drill it and do everything.
Come with me, get the wood, measure it the lot.
And he said that's alright.
So how much you reckon that's gonna be, cost then?
He said what, if you're getting them  he got a worktop six erm  sixty inches.
That must be two foot he must mean.
And  for his kitchen the thick stuff.
That's what you want he said the thick stuff.
You don't want that thin little stuff like that.
He said and that cost me  he looked round, twenty two pound.
Well I said Angie said she went up Wicks' and got her worktops and it cost her fifteen pound.
And he said well Wicks' are cheaper he said we'll go to Wicks' then and  I'll measure up for it when I come over.
What, have I gotta take him up?
Yeah because Jenny might, she might be on a late.
If she's on a late.
But she's on a early she can come with him and we'll go in her car.
Put the roof-rack on her car.
But if not if, if  I go up with them and I'd go in with them.
Just wait in the car.
I'll go in with them and see what I gotta get  and just strap it on the roof.
And he'll come home and do it he said.
What colour are you do , well you gotta , haven't you?
Yeah.
as well.
So that's what he said, it might be a bit more than twenty pound.
So he said, I said well  what if I get the stuff  right?
Erm I said if there's any money left over  I'll give you the money, I said and give you the rest the week after or if there's none left I'll give you the tenner week  Oh that's alright don't worry about that, he said, that's fine.
I said alright.
Well I want it done properly see and I said you gotta drill and all that.
You gotta buy my Christmas present yet mind.
Eh?
You gotta buy my Christmas present yet.
Oh yeah I'll sort that out.
Is he better yet then?
No.
Well then.
You could sort me out this week with all that money you've got.
I'm getting me kitchen done.
And then I'll get Christmas presents.
Cos the walls ain't gonna be done  I'll get back and get a tub next week and I gotta tenner left over look to get you something for  and get your hat.
You'll have to come with me Chris.
Because they do it in sizes.

If they haven't got any green  worktops cos Ange said when she went up there 
You'd best price that as well.

They didn't have any worktops, the green Ange said.
She can't remember any but there again you were she weren't looking for green.
But they've got that marble.
You know what we had?

They got that sort of marble stuff.
The same as the floor so I might pick the green marble.
To go with the floor.
I don't know yet.
Well I really want  light green.
If they've got it.
If they haven't got it well  He said if, I can always cut it down to size and that.

Gotta sand it off.
The Polyripple peels off though Zoe.
It goes like rubber.
Does it?

Do you know how much I paid?
How much?
I paid  for a tub of polyripple already  with the stuff in it

Something like that.
Is it?
And then erm 
Roll it out after.
You gotta roll it out af , and you've gotta leave it on so long like overnight, and it stinks.

And it's  in a Rome pink it is, like a sort of a  nice pink.
It looks really nice it do.
And she got her bath in the middle of the bathroom.
So you buy a packet of Artex?
You don't buy it in tubs?

About a fiver I expect, the Unibond.
And you gotta mix it up 
 
it's like mi mixing a cake.

The Polyripple.
But the bathroom  bathroom

I went up the shops and changed  a pound.

so I'd have it for her?
And er  she asked me for it.
I thought bloody hell Lynn you're only waiting for fifty P, you know?
But still she seems to be round here all the time more or less don't she?
Yeah.
She's a bit funny.
Do you ever go up her house?
Yeah, now and again.
But she erm   like, you know?
Yeah.
I remember another time I borrowed her strimmer, right?
Yeah.
And I  on the Friday.
On the Monday I  take it back but I didn't see her and I forgot.
Yeah.
See her on the Tuesday and she said to me  erm  Chris was coming round your house Saturday.
And I looked at her, I said what for.
She said because er he wanted our strimmer back.

He was looking to see where you lived.
I said my god Lynn, I, it was only a mistake.
Forgot, you know but you'd get it back.
Oh and she didn't take no bloody notice of me might have been  
Well she knows she's, she's a bit funny then.
Otherwise she wouldn't feel so conscious about it.
You gotta be careful with her.
Mm.
You know, what you say to her.
And if you tell her about somebody she'll tell them.
Yeah.
You know  chat I said  don't like me hair.
She'll go and tell them.

Cos  Ange said she'd, she'd been chatting about Jenny to her.
She went and told Jenny.
And Jenny asked Ange about it.
See?
Maybe it's the best thing she could have done then, get a job?
Yeah.
And now she's paranoid.
She thinks everyone's talking about her.
I said I've got better things to do than talk about you Lynn.
Yeah.
And that day we was all over Jenny's.
Ange said let's pop in Jenny's.
So we go down Jenny's and er  the door knocked and I said  Christ it's Lynn .
And Lynn came in.
You should have seen her face  cos we were sat in Jenny's.
Ooh.

Oh well.
She does stare quite a bit I must admit.
Yeah.
Don't she?
Yeah she does.
as if every, she thinks everybody is talking about her .
Yes.
There's no need for it.
Yeah I know.
And what's this  Angie's taking her kid  little boy out of school.
Yeah.
She's thinking of taking him out isn't she.
Cos erm  I mean she went to a report evening and Miss  said, was saying about Jay and saying  you know if he falls behind you  know what'll happen and Ange says what?
Well you'll have to go in the office.
Course that was playing on Angie's mind see and Miss  said she'd give Jason extra work.
Yeah.
Cos it had been playing on her mind for weeks.
Mm.
So she's been trying to get work off her.
Well in the end she took a stack and went in to see  Miss  and Miss  tried to change the subject,subj 
Subject.
Yeah.
So erm  anyway she told her that she wanted Jay out.
And she wanted her to  Mr .
Well she hasn't gone to Mr .
So Ange rang this bloke, woman who  sorted out Chrissie at at the school.
Yeah.
And she goes up Parker school so  she was going, she said to Ange she was talking to Miss  tomorrow.
Yesterday, sorry.
Yeah.
But Ange hasn't heard nothing.
So I think she's gonna ring them back up again.
I think Miss  shouldn't have said what she said because  Jay hasn't got a problem.
But she just said it  like if he drops down like Chrissie you know what would happen see?
Yeah.
Course it worried Ange look cos she don't want to go back in the office like last time.
Mm.

No, I trimmed it for her last week
Yeah.
cos it needed cutting.
But she, she's asked me to perm it and she's cancelled and she's ever so funny with hairdressers sort of thing.
Well erm  I said if you want me to do it let me know and I'll come and do it but just make  well she's cancelled before because once she hadn't got the money and 
Oh.
which is the excuse, I'd rather somebody went along sort of said right I'll have it done such and such a time rather than keep buggering about
Yeah.
like anybody, do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Oh come on, you've got to have one more in here.
Right.
And er  you know she asked me to cut it for her so I cut it for her.
Yeah.
Which, it looks a hell of a lot better now  than what it did before.

Yeah but erm 
So what time did you cut Ange's hair?
About eleven.
She still going up Kingswood?
