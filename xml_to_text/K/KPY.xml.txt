I'm sure there's a bus strike
where's the thing?, yes it is a bus strike it said on the, on the
and yet we walked to school and we didn't see one
yeah, but that one was going the other way
yeah
what time did you catch a bus?
really, really, really, really late


well we, we, we never saw it
I know 
unless we were just kind of indulge in a conversation and we didn't  see it
that means we'll have to walk there if we go to 
yeah 
unless, unless you wanna go to your house, and then you come to my house 
no
and then  come to my house when you 
you're coming to my house you know
yeah, alright, alright
at first, are we taking the tube alright?, you walk up and have a look
and then you, us go to your house and look and then  and then us go to my house okay  and then
 
yeah, but that's gonna take ages, it's, we're not gonna be able to  get up to Kilburn on time 
why'd you have to go home?, just to get some money, how much is it a pointer?
if you two take the 
yeah, go to my house it's much quicker
and phone your parents at your house
yeah you can phone your mum, just say you're going up to Kilburn
no way
to buy, to buy some pens or something for school, cos I need to get a pen anyway, so it won't be, you know
catch a train now?
no  quick increase your pace, increase your pace
aha, ah?
increase your pace, increase your pace, only joke, er, normally I'm made  Amy's coming over this summer
is she?
yeah
stay at your house?
no  
 
I'm not having them stay at my house, it's not big enough anyway
Sarah tonight I'm gonna stay at your house
not in my bedroom 
I think so
no, no
hey, guess what?, and we'll buy some chips with vinegar
are you?, wow, just come to my house, don't go home
yeah can I phone from your house?
cos it's gonna take way too long, erm, yeah
of course 
sorry I didn't take it in, yeah
of course, what you have to pay  
what are you, you're given you're given her permission to phone
yes  
from my house 
yeah, yeah
do you pay the phone bill?
no, you do though
well no  I don't, I
who pays your phone bill?
well my nan pays a third, no, a third of it my dad pays a third and my mum pays a third
oh
well, like, my mums and dads are all in one really so they pay 
so they just get it out
two thirds, yeah
yeah 
so you know a bit like that 
so your mum doesn't charge you anything for using the phone
no
that's good
does your mum?
no 
but, she prefers for me not to stay on the phone for very long she does
yeah
cos the phone bill 
she doesn't like me doing 
I don't listen, I mean  sorry, I've got a frog in my throat, erm  like, she tells me not to stay on the phone too long, but sometimes I have to, okay, not, not necessarily just as a conversation, but, homework and stuff
 

why you walking?

oh yeah, yeah
so, so then Anita goes, no I go tell him to put it in a letter then, yeah, and he was gonna put it in a letter and then he changed his mind and he said he was gonna ask me after school, but then he didn't ask me after school and Kate gave him my phone number and then he phoned me
yeah
and then he asked me then  and erm, he didn't know whether to ask me or not, well he knew, he knew more or less I'd say yes anyway, cos I more, I'd already said yes, but not to his face, so  but he didn't know whether to because Henry fancied me 
when you ask someone out, I'm scared in case they might say no
I know
