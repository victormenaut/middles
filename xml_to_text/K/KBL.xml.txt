There's some che there's some tea down here.
I would have been very concerned that some great big hairy  bouncer would come leaping out at me!
Anyway, it was a bit weird cos we had to go with parties cos they're all  they're all black and they're all about six and a half feet tall you know!
And they don't take any crap from anyone,I tell you !
Don't they?
Oh oh oh!
I said , I said we've been doing boundaries for the trial park today and they ran out of passes and gave us these and said they'd be alright.
And he goes, er I'm not sure ah, and he nearly let us in there and then but he had to go and see somebody else and he said tell them to go away!
So we had to go away !
That was the first attempt?
That's the first time and then we  and then we were still around the back and we darted up over these banks
Ha!
and into these trees and  where we were up there no one could see us and we could see the place, so we would see all the gaps in the fences.
So we planned out our next move and went  just went down and did it!
Oh God!
Next to the  !
 
Sounds li like the S A S!
Finally did it then?
Mm.
Took us about ten minutes.
Well you're very brave!
I wouldn't do it!
I'd be frightened to death!
See and all that screaming and all that aggravation could have been avoided if you'd have known you were going to get in.
Well I mean  that's him isn't it?
Noisy for that reason.
Well Dad   and Sophie told him exactly what, what he was like and everything   thought oh my God!
Gonna be trouble here!
So a big argument was there?

Yeah, all fluffy and  good aren't you?


Tongue hanging out!


Got lovely bright eyes!
Looking very well these days!
Masters again, yeah.
What do you mean masters?
Mastered to get into the race.
Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in!
I bet, I bet  he's scared 
I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's  for security guards.
You cannot walk past them if  you're going in that way.
So we had to go  past this little shed which is right up  right up this stupid grass earthy bank  right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.
Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great  hole in the gate  massive!
Walked through there and got to the simulator  took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in  walked straight past and we were right on site!
We wasn't aware it was there.
Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!
So all  ?
We were going , we were in!
We're in!
We're in!
Pretty good!
So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really?
Eh?
All that 
And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
Have you got to pass for the stage then?
Yeah.
I used an 
What 
old one.
So  those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine  turned mine round she saw it and went  she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't  thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't  just turned it round on her.
I bet your  friends a will be  sick then, won't they?
I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one!
And there must have been about ten thousand there last time.
They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in  and you can spin round.
Oh yeah!
They had one of those in there  but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!
Those lasers  lasers that   the .
Velcro walls?
No, they didn't have that there.
A huge octopus,octopus  -ish, had these massive  tentacles that's going right the way across the ceiling!
Video screens.
Very good!
They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in for nothing!
Why is your voice so quiet?
Cos  the washing machine out there  it's .
What sort of smoke  from the machine?
Hiss!
Oh it's ?
No !
What hissing?
Proper smoke machine.
Oh!
Mum!
I've got to write to Bicksons.
Mm.
Ask them to write me a reference so I got form to fill in  to send off for something but I've gotta write something.
And I've gotta to, I've gotta say something to them.
Yeah, well?
And I dunno who I'm writing to either.
Well, put the  Principal.
What should I say?
What do you think I should say?
Ask  to write me a  ah I know who I'll ask, alright..
Well cos  said that   this guy said that  's the guy in  so I could
Well then you
I can
have to send him a stamped  envelope with the address of the guy and putting   on it.
He'll be more inclined to  do it then won't he?
Oh what , what inside in the 
Inside the  letter that you're  writing to him.
I think that that would probably be quite a good idea wouldn't it, really?
Yes?
You must be exhausted?
Why don't you go to sleep?
this stuff haven't I?
I've got things to do.
I suppose we could  just ignore it.
It's a waste of a day isn't it, really?
I'd rather be  extremely tired.
Saw Zac last night.
What did erm, he say?

And take my earring out when I go to have an interview.
If they don't love me for what I am that's just tough shit!
Yeah, but I mean if it, if it  erm  if it  means that that it might spoil your  entry into it, it's such a sa small thing isn't it?

What?
I dunno  really.
Show me.
No !
Why ?
Why not?
I'm aching all over.
See all that bolshy  all that silly  bolshiness was totally unnecessary wasn't it?
I tell you all those Fantasia Security blokes are a bunch of prats, all of them!they're all so stubborn!
Well er 
Why?
In what way?
Just go up on the stage and just start  just talking to people and suddenly they, get back!
Get back!
Get off!
Get off!
Why was they saying  were they saying it to you then ?

Go on, get off!
Get out the way!
You know?
Anybody from Cornwall there?
Yeah, who?
Neil was there, Chris was there, Wayne was there, a few others.
I thought, I thought that Matthew  was
No he's not there, he's skint!
God he's spent  he's spent all his grant hasn't he?
God!
He's gonna get into some awful trouble isn't he?
Mm.
I mean, he's nearly as  as overdrawn as Sophie and she's, she's nearly completed her course!
I know!
He just hasn't got a clue though!
He doesn't care yo hasn't got a clue!
He must be worried about it though?
Surely he must be worried?
Well I was talking to him about it, I said I reckon you've spent the  you've spent quite a bit now so you might as well just go another  get final .
Three years!
Three year course!
I know !
And he  can't   he usually works in the Bistro in Padsdown, he couldn't work in there to repay it!
Because when he's in there his wage packets are like minus fifteen pounds when he's in there!
Why?
Because he spends it all!
So really he's got to get a job which is gonna  pay the majority of it off.

Annie, Annie works twenty four hours a we , Annie works twenty four hours a week in this shop right  and the , she claims family credit as well and i i ,we if Adrian works  all the benefits go under  he has to 
Yeah but yo 
earn something like two hundred quid a week to  to match what they're getting now!
It isn't like that!
It is!
Well yeah, er okay I can accept that  but I think  mentally
Yeah.
you know, I think I mean, I mean he even to  going back to college doing a couple of  A levels wouldn't alter his benefit.
I mean, do something, you know!
Yeah.
I could not live like that!
No I couldn't.
I'd go mad!
Especially out there over that shop in Kings Dainton.
He's got his car, he's got Jamie  so he's not that bad!
He's got his son and er 
Yeah but it's not mentally stimulating is it?
It's not!
Er.
At least he's quite happy well I'll tell you that.
Alright for six months but when it, it gets starting to think oh my God!
