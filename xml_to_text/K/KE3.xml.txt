the body.

It's about that long  and it 
and it 
just came up over night  till we found out in the morning  well you can see it can't you  Oh you  did you see it?the swelling on your dad's foot.
Yeah  yeah I did.
If I had a swelling like that come up on my ankle I'd  say right go to the doctors.
Just one more and I'll do just have a quick look round the outside see if they're here.
Mhm.
I really enjoyed my day off today   .
Lets face it theirs wasn't  to pick from  should say  really miserable.

No 
No not worried  she said you walk in, you get changed, and you sit back and that's it, silence.
Oh.
Nobody speaks.
Mm  Can I have a few more  thank you.
What?
Oh okay  I'll set a little game.
Will you?
Yeah.
I liked it knowing what I want.
No it's horrible cos you just sit down an that's it.
It was a good idea taking your own dressing gown though wasn't it?
Mm.
There was one girl there today, she was about fifteen or seventeen  and she had to put her coat on over the top of the gown because it was 
Oh.
all open down the back and you had to walk out through a huge waiting room full of people.
Well that's bad isn't it?
That's awful isn't it?
Yeah  mm.
Would they lend you a dressing gown?
Well normally they'd given them dressing gowns before but it's the first time they've had gowns isn't it?
White gowns.
Yeah they had gowns before and that's what, remember?.
Oh yeah, that's right you had to hold yours up together as well.
Mm.
Don't go in there  and that could have gone down my whole body as I was walking through everything  keeps falling off.
Just think that's going to pick up all your tummy gurglings   gurgle gurgle .
Do you think we could have a listen to this?
Well  the only way you can listen to it
Mm.
Is on the headphones.
Couldn't you stick them on me?
How long will one of those tapes last then, Tony?
Forty five minutes  well each side is forty five minutes.

Well  I don't know but it's still going.
There's a tape counter on it.
Sorry?

Okay.


If things had turned out differently I'd been driving you down here.
Ah  never mind  it won't be long.
No it won't be long  saying that a year ago.
I think half of its nerves.
Yeah.
It's all nerves.
It's like you the first time weren't it.
Yeah.
Oh come on  don't play me up, we'll have to check this.
Got a bit cold have you Jack?

Your welcome.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow night then?
Okay then.
Yeah  worst luck.
Cheerio  cheerio Christine.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh cr 
Mum, would you just sit up there with the bike  like a twist bike.
Hurry up.
Put the radio on now.
Can I put the radio on?
Yeah.
I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that I'd never driven in the dark before.
Well yeah, it's bound to throw you, I mean its 
Mm.
it's the first time you drove in the dark was on your driving test  wasn't it?
Yeah  I must admit I think that a little bit erm
It was unfortunate
Yeah
but it was .
I suppose I could have er  looking at 
Was it as dark as this?.
By the time I'd finished, yes  it was pitch dark.
Well the only thing you can do is hopefully your next test isn't at the same time  make it a 
Yeah.
different time.
But in any event it would be a good idea if I had some tests  some lessons in the dark.
Might be  I mean ask Brian, see 
Mm.
what he can do because
Yeah
I mean I knew  the first day I drove in the dark was the first night we had the car and it was most odd experience
Yeah.
I mean  first day 
I found it 
driving a brand new car and then
Yeah.
driving in the dark for the first time, ha.
Yeah  I'd find it quite difficult  well I could see the headlights  coming up  and I was thinking  now how fast is that car coming up  I don't really know.
Yeah  and the thing is also being  new to driving you tend to look at the headlights rather than look away from them.
Yeah.
And that doesn't help because  I don't know, it wasn't, I don't think you'd find it was as dark as this.
Mm.
Not at four o' clock, its not quite that dark at


half past, yeah
Yeah.
but not this dark at four, not yet.
Well he had to switch on the interior light to be able to fill out the form.
Oh yeah, it's pretty dark but not 
Mm.
it's not black like this.
Mm.
Are you, what are you doing tomorrow, are you coming in with me?
Erm  yeah.
Friday.
Yeah.
Good.
I'm coming with you  I've got to do er  I've gotta do some prep 
it's nice to have someone to talk to.
Yeah, but you may be recorded.
I don't care.
Oh.
Nice chap.
Where did he come from?
He came out of the Harvester but it would have been nice if he'd waited  for there to be a gap in the traffic .
Yeah.
If you see what I mean.
Yeah  Oh he wasn't gonna wait 
.
either.
Oh dear.
Ah  it's gonna be one of those nights tonight .
Yeah I think so  I must admit from one point of view  I'm quite glad that I  haven't  passed  cos 
Why?
it's a bad  as you said it's a bad time to start driving now there's an awful lot of
Idiots come out.
idiots on the road  especially coming 
last 
up to Christmas
Yeah, last Christmas was a real eye opener to me, cos the Christmas before
Mm.
I didn't drive very much cos my Dad was still so bad I only did 
Yeah.
the essential journeys
Mhm.
and I mean I then I'd only just had my operation an and to actually  drive  for longer than about  twenty minute journeys was killing  so 
Yeah.
I only drove over to to do the shopping and to pick Christine up from School.
Yeah.
That was all.
Yeah you're right I look at the headlights.
Yeah you must do you see you've got to 
Mm.
look  if you've got to concentrate on anything, concentrate on the white line or
Yeah.
the kerb  certainly the white line if you can
Yeah.
cos if you concentrate on the kerb you tend to drive a bit too close to it
Yeah.
and also it's not always there for you to see easily
No.
whereas the white line is  But if you look into the headlights it can be  not dark  erm but  it appears to be dark because
Well your pupils re erm
they react into the headlights.
react into the headlights, yeah  so it makes it seem darker.
And you've gotta be careful as well at night not to hang on to the tail lights of the thing in from of you
Mm.
cos it's very easy to do it because they're two little red beacons
Yes.
you know you've still got to look ahead
Yes.
and concentrate on what's happening
Yes.
further up the road.
There was one point during my test when I was driving along and erm  the I was creeping forward in a stream of traffic and the person in front of me had crossed the solid white line at some traffic lights  and the lights changed and it would have been very easy to follow his lights and just carry on
Yeah.
but I didn't I stopped  
But you see it every day  I mean
Yeah.
You know I've had it happen the lights have changed just as I've been crossing them so I've gone over and three cars immediately behind me have followed me.
Yeah.
We're gonna have to get a tyre gauge I reckon  they've got a new depth of tread  one point six millimetres which is bigger than the.
Now he's gonna be sneaky now .
No the only thing that consumed me I was looking to see if there was anyway  that material from the seat could be used to sort of target us for a mailing system or something like that
No but it can't
Not  not if they stick by th what they've said
Yes and it's more than they 
Well yeah.
We even know where it came from.
Yes  that's right  He was travelling wasn't he?
Well on the wrong side of the road as well just a bit rather nutty.
Yeah.
Are we gonna have another go at Christine's bedroom this weekend?
Could do, yep.
Do you want to see if we can finish it Christine.
Yep.
How about if we went out and bought the desk  erm 
Yes  yes Mummy.
Now wait  erm Saturday?
Yeah.
Only we I don't, I don't know about you but I don't want to leave it until the last minute
No  No 
I'd rather 
Mum.
We're gonna have to take these for Christmas shopping.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well  we've got to finish sorting it out Chris cos there's still too much stuff  for once it's 
Can I 
when it's completely sorted out Chrissie  erm  oh I don't really know what to say, she's having this desk for Christmas
Yeah.
once her bedroom is sorted oh well, well we'll have a talk about it later on okay?
It's whether we put the desk in the room.
It's whether we do it now and we let her have it before
Mhm  and then she'll feel she's not had anything for Christmas.
No I won't.
Well  this or
Find a cheaper one.
We'll have a think through.
Well she'll still get her ch her stocking and
Yeah.
a voucher for Christmas.
Yeah  and she'll have other things to open on Christmas day won't she.
Yes, I don't think she's going to be short, do you?
 
A bit like with the keyboards isn't it  two keyboards for a birthday present.
The thing the desk you can use  once we've got your bedroom sorted out
Yeah.
but Christine it's gonna be  arranging that desk is gonna take a whole er oh  arranging the bedroom is gonna take a whole day  cos you're wardrobe is too heavy to move on it's own it's got to be taken apart
Yeah.
Okay?
I really want it in.
But it's gonna take a long time, it's not gonna be a  quick half hour job
Yeah  It's gonna involve a lot of moving as well 
Well no not  the heaviest thing is your wardrobe
Yeah.
and that's gotta be taken apart right?
 
And the bed will slide to one end.
.
Everything's got to be sorted out I think her pram and  her other desk is gonna have to go up in the
Mummy?
Yes.
Mummy, there's one thing I don't like though
What's that?
Gonna have  ages
Well I think I might be able to sort that out a lot of it will be underneath your
You know where 
well some of 
Yeah.
it will covered up in any case.
Yeah.
It's alright, I'm just  going up one  up here.
No.
That place where your wardrobe is
Yeah.
erm  will be covered up by your bed
Yeah.
and the place where two of th 
It's not my wardrobe so much, it's my bed  my bed 
Yeah, but 
is at one end
Well I've  heard of a tip  whether it works or not I don't know  so we'll try it and see  that's all 
Alright, what's that 
we can do  she put an ice cube on the  splodge  let it melt and when it drys out the carpet comes up again but I don't know if it'll work but it can't do any harm, can it?
No, just might be quite a bit wet.
Be a  daughter.
Oh god.
.
.
What's that?
This thing 
The 
that you we're playing with this morning and you didn't put it in properly.
Yeah,and rubbing it all down the window with my cardi.
Yeah.
I've spoken, don't do that any more!


Squeak.
Don't do that any more.


Can't wait to get this bedroom sorted out   Do think I could have my desk ?
I think so there's not much point in  keeping it in it's box is there
No, it's gonna put to good use 
What do you think?
Tony?
 
Yeah, okay but we'll have to do it when we've got time
Don't
and that might be  shortly before Christmas anyway.
Okay?
Okay.
It's only another three, four weeks to Christmas now in any case.
You might have to wait until we're act 
She's been a bit sick.
Oh  you might have to fit  you might have to fix  you might have to wait until we've got  time off over Christmas before we do it, anyway.
Yeah.
Cos we've only got Sundays  and this Sunday

How do they feel now?
Ah  I mean they will soften anyway and they are comfortable  it's just that the sides are a bit rigid at the moment but then they're bound to be  and they will give.

Yeah, I think so.

.
The this is better technical jargon that suppose to help
Right .
,the recovery of that circular four, appendix one of the planning resources handbook so, all of the items for which the E S can recover the VAT and that the invoices payable, the re-coverall VAT for once are part of the resource allocation and any short fall can seriously effect the E S budget.
It's  that in the period April ninety one to September ninety one there has been under recovery of VAT of nearly half a million pounds, will wait until they recover it  of which two er twenty six thousand is the true result of the South West Region of twenty six thousand pounds just over twenty one and a half thousand pounds related to job club fees, with all staff responsible for organising rosters even sure they are around the content of appendix one, section four, and that that  correctly identified in cages, Margaret Cornwall.
Write in the Margaret all systems computer  so we can all read it.
.
Well I, I got to get up and walk over and find it .
.
Because I do not hold  the appropriate resource in hand, whatever she's got, very helpful isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, wonderful.
That's all of interest in this I .
oh, you know it's amazing when you erm  a reference always refers to something else, you gotta go and get that
Yes, I think  we ought to do something about it Tony,a message.
Ah look at this, Client Service  Handbook, that's in this  over Section F.
It says F is for literacy problems, debts problems and drug alcohol problems as well as.
Try telling that to my three year old see what .
.
It's  fire engine.
.
I didn't .
Where am I, here we are, New Employer, you have to get a copy of that .
Some of these official inspections are awful aren't they?
Well, there, there going to  understand what they, what they've written about as well as .
yeah.
Oh here, here is a fine example  anything with  in it has got to be doubtful.
, yes .
Goodness gracious me, here we go.
Right.
Th this is a crunchy, sort off pot putting anyone within the employment service can request change to .
E G a change to a cost centre or a .
Changes are to be carefully considered before there  because due to the complexity and the importance of those  even minor changes, cause unexpected problems.
That can't mean nothing.
I suppose,tell me what I shall consider
No.
How I shall consider it.
Why I should want to change anything, just nothing..
Here gigantic  gi , we use to have a word of the day when erm Ian was here, use to put word of the day up on the board
Mm, mm.
What we do is take the, the day of the week and the, the calendar date, it might be the  say it was the fourth day of the week Thursday
Yeah.
And it was July, it's got to .
It was the third day in July, page four, seven, three and then I had to find a word that I'd never heard off before and put it up on the board.
.
Like gromwell,..
.
And then people would put up there suggestions of what a gromwell was  .
.
It was good fun, we won't, I won't re-institute that one.
Yeah that's good.
Ginormous, where are we, ginormous, erm, no it's not in here and er G Y or J I or J Y so no it doesn't  .
No , but eh, another word that was  I've heard used, and it was, actually it was quite annoying because the chap used it, used it wrongly, but I didn't know that he'd used it wrongly at the time.
Mm, mm.
What  .
It was paradigm.
Paradigm?
Yes.
Yeah, paradigm that, that's a bit like a paradox but completely different
.
What, what is it  as a paradigm .
You, you, you can't, yeah , you said you can't use er money as a paradigm for energy.
Ah.
And what he really meant to say was, you can't use money as a er a  as a sort of parallel to energy, but paradigm doesn't mean parallel, it means something, something different.
It does, doesn't it?
Yeah.
I mean it's not  they way you expect it either, yeah, paradigm means example of pattern of, reflection of noun, hence parasite, big .
.
No, I don't think I believe  at all.
No, but, he was using it as, as a fancy word for parallel and he wasn't using it properly.
The trouble is I didn't know because I've never heard the word before.
So, you could off asked him, what's he mean by the word paradigm.
Yeah.
Because I've never used that word before, he'll say something completely pathetic.
.
At least you'll know what he meant by it.
.
In years to come now they'll life it out and say oh look at it.
I think it's how they used to speak in the twentieth century.
That's right, in the year nineteen ninety one or whatever, no I thought it was quite, quite good.
Yeah.
Bit of erm  and it's all anonymous and everything so
Oh you've got  tape, you've got another one?
How did you get two?
There's some more at college, I haven't got one yet.
Oh alright then.

They got erm
Did you take your bottle of milk in this morning before you went ?
it's stopped raining and  it's not raining or anything.
Well there weren't any, didn't have any.
No it's not raining.
Well you have it might  .
There be stalls outside if it's not raining , if it rains then they have them indoors.
Did you take our milk in this morning?
I can't remember.
Well there's two lots there 
Crates there , but no milk.
There's two in, in your, in your, in your, your er a fridge, and I thought it might .
I normally bring that .
So I picked up the thing with an empty bottle and put it in the, on the kitchen.
I normally bring the crate in.
Well it was marked for one and there was no milk, there was no er, there was an empty bottle in the thing, but no milk, as long as he don't charge you for  .
What they telling her off for?
Cos they've been worried with the press in the hospital .
Dad phoned me up twice from your house this morning and couldn't get no answer here, he said, I was sat here so I can here the phone go, anyway he went around again later on, tried it, and it was alright then.
Don't what it was.
Weren't that funny?
Also in dad's last night said sat up watching the gold fish and he said oh I'll, I'll give you, I'll give you a tank and I'll get some fish on Sunday.
So what did she sa did you say?
Well she didn't think he was serious,he was, so were gonna have to phone up tonight and say look, no fish.
Mm.
Oh well not, you can't get them to fit?
No I can't, I can get a size eleven.
Mm, mm .
But I've got a very high in-step you see..
Oh, so they don't fit across the front.
Is that  you bought last night?
No.
Similar to that though in it?
Yeah.
Well when I finally chuck out these brown ones what I wear every day.
Well you've got another pair of brown ones upstairs you could wear as well, you've got a new pair of brown ones upstairs
I know.
and you've got a pair of black shoes ain't you?
Yeah.
Got any others?
No, so I was gonna say, I, I, go  up to the  shop up Kingswood see if they had any cheap up there.
No, it'll take a while
Yeah .
it'll come suddenly.
What all you need know is a polishing off.
Mm.
You know, you, it's, that's what it is it's getting the flow 
Yeah.
and that takes the one off
Erm, but, he sorted something out for me, I, I said, cos of course now
Carry on drying your hair can you?
You've got it all  .
Yes of course, you carry on drying your hair.
erm, so what happens now, is that er  I'm coming off the er, coming off the clutches as  before the corner
Yeah.
and if it's a tight one, and you're going round it in first, really tight one, then what you need to be doing really is slipping the clutch 
Yeah.
if it's really tight, slipping the clutch in first  and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to control it on the accelerator, you can't do it.
You'll be able to, but you can't at the moment.
Mm.
And that 
And it's much easier to try and control it on the clutch.
Yeah.
So he s , I said to him is it alright, says am I in danger of coasting if I've got my foot on the  if, if I'm taking the corner in first and  I'm slipping and  I got the clutch, I'm using the engine but I've, not much
Yeah.
and he said oh no that's not coasting.
No.
It's only if you've got the clutch right in.
Yeah.
But, erm,in second my foot should be flat on the floor.
He took me round that blooming Argyle Road three times.
Oh, the horrible corner.
Yeah, cos I told that was one, I said that's, that's the one I, I over slowed on my test.
Yeah.
And he's told me that it's first gear, right.
Yeah.
So what I was doing I was coming into it, I was coming in too fast for the gear, not too fast for the corner, but too fast for the gear.
Yeah.
Shoving it in, shoving it into first, bring the clutch up quickly and the car goes  weer and virtually stops 
Yeah , yeah, yeah .
so it wasn't the fact I was trying to lose too much speed, it was that I changed into first and didn't have
Enough revs on the engine to keep it going 
enough revs on the engine , he'd be going and when I lift, raised the clutch, whereas if I had brought the clutch up part way 
The car would of slowly slowed down to be at the speed that the engine 
Yeah .
was going on, yeah  yeah.
Well as I actually had to going round the corner, to get myself round the corner, I had to come off the brake and onto the accelerator
Yeah.
to actually get myself round the corner.
Yeah.
 

Yes, because you see,, I don't remember, I, I think I take that one in second you see.
Mm.
But,
I took it, I, he said well try it and we went round it in first and I went and it went  rrah 
Yeah.
and, and, so erm, we  er, then I came round and I did it in second, he said there you went too wide there
Yeah.
you came close to the white line.
Yeah.
Yes, course there's always a car parked on the corner isn't it?.
There's always a car parked on the corner 
 
.
I must admit I'd always cheat at that corner, when I'm coming up to it, I don't do it suddenly
Mm.
I'm then coming up to it, I move fractionally out into the road
yeah.
then you've got more room to get round  If you sit glued to the pavement it's a hell of a job to get round
Mm.
whereas if your fractionally out further into the road it's easier to, got slightly different 
I didn't have that excuse because there's a car parked before the turning
oh, so you've had to get out 
I had to be out wide and then turn in 
yeah.
and there's a car on the opposite side of the road as you turn in  aha, so you go outside work and then round and ha, ha, oh 
You'll get it.
But, that slipping the clutch is blimey useful.
It is.
I beginning to find how useful, cos I can keep the revs going 
Yeah.
When, when I'm not sure what's happening, and people are sort of weaving about and things like that, you can use that and you can just tick over and your ready to move if you need to and you can stop quite quickly if you need to as well.
Yeah, yeah, I see.
I mean, we've, I've, there was a  situation  these are the roads he's taking me around now, he had me reverse round the corner which was practically blind, couldn't see what was round the corner, so I was edging round, and it was on a hill so I had to do it, every time I stopped I had to put the handbrake on so I didn't roll
Yeah.
And  edging round the corner, checking all ways, there was a parked car, there's a van parked the opposite side of the road so anything turning in had to come over into my, the path of me
Yeah.
and a, coming out of that there were some cars parked, some other cars trying to drive through, I was coming out trying to turn right, there was another car waiting to turn left, and he couldn't come in cos I was coming out.
Yeah.
So I had to drive out past him, pull over to the other side of the road as much as possible to let him come through and the other cars come through, then I could  come .
Yeah.
And doing that, to have the clutch sort of half way up in first you just sort of, you just 
you need help  ,
sort of kick on  and it's quite nice and you've got it all under control and if you get a chance to go you can and if you've got to stop it's no problem.
yeah 
And then I got myself in a knot  cos there was a car coming up the road
Yeah
between a lot of parked cars and there was a, I was coming down the road and all I needed to do was to actually stop where I was  cos there was enough room on his side of the road for him to come past the parked car and round me
Yeah.
I sort off, parked car there and I came up and he had room to do that
Yeah.
and what I did was, there was a gap here, and I drove into the gap nose first, and I did do a hell of a lot of steering to get myself out
Yeah, but  that means that they still do occasionally
Yeah.
I mean, that, very, very occasionally you'll do something and you'll think, erm why didn't I do that  you think that's stupid, you know ,
 
and you think oh.
yeah .
There's no need, no need to do that he said.
No, occasionally I'll do something like that mind you .
There's plenty of room, yeah there's plenty of room for him to get passed in.
Yeah  I was annoyed, up at Christine's school the other day, I was waiting for Anita, and there's driveways all along that road
Mm, mm.
so there's stops where you can park on those 
Yeah 
driveways, it was pouring down with rain one day so I was going up to meet her and we, I'd got up there, I've learnt now, I leave home  at quarter past three if it's raining
mm.
I go up to meet Anita, anyway you can get a parking space up there, so I've turned, drove up there  they say I haven't left as early, it was while I was learning 
Yeah.
when the erm, so it, a car parked across a drive  and a car, the car behind him which was in a space was going
Mm.
and it was in quite a big space, I could off got in behind him and then changed if I'd reversed in  but when I saw this other chap sat in his car and then he indicated he wanted to pull out, so I let him go
Mm.
Then I drove into his space  well then somebody else came and drove in behind me  and the car in front then was sort of, oh yeah, then somebody else came and reversed in in front of him, so the car in front it was across the drive was boxed in by this time, I didn't box him in I just 
No .
parked behind, but then somebody else came and parked in front of him, and he was there and sort, you could see him looking you know, he looked at the driveway and he looked, he was looking in his rear view mirror and then he turned round and looked like this, then he looked at the front, and he was thinking my god I can't get out of here, and all of a sudden a little car comes up the road stops, goes beep, beep on the horn, wanna get in the drive, this bloke went ha, ha, ha, ha  and he couldn't do anything  
.
So, so, he looked, he looked round at me, he looked at the  the other group waiting in front and he was, he flashed his lights at them so that, they realised what was going on by then, they moved forward a bit , I moved back a bit and he just had enough room he reversed right up close to me and then got out but he just had enough room to get out, and since then I won't park over the driveway up there, cos you can bet your life the one driveway along that road and you parked in front is the one that somebody wants to get into.
Ah .
Yeah.
Oh right, I'd better go actually.
Mother eh be er complaining.
Yeah, okay.
Where have you been, you said half past three.
Well it's twenty five to four, what does that .
It'll be twenty to by the time I get round there..
Better do this washing up hadn't I?
I can't 
I'd put 
believe it when he took the .
I put in for the eh, my driving test again.
Oh good.
Okay.
Good, good.
Sometime in the New Year now.
What date did you put on the form, not before
Well he's put a month from the last  test.
Mm.
Well you won't have it around Christmas, after between Christmas and the New year .
No , no.
It'll be erm, January time I suppose .
I, I said to him I, I don't want, I know I can't have a test soon, but I don't really want another one  that soon.
No  but now all that your doing is polishing your drive better off
Mm.
unfortunately that can be a very painful business 
Mm.
Depends
Yeah.
You might find it easy
Yeah.
easier.
What 
But.
we doing tomorrow?
Tomorrow well, trainee to wash and a hoover  
Mm.
This is yet, Tesco's open as well, we've lost our
Yeah.
little driving spaces now.
Yeah, okay.
Masterline's open,are open.
Yeah, so I can't
You can have a drive round actually, round by the Coca Cola factory there maybe somewhere
Mm.
you can go.
I think I, what, what I'm thinking is that this sort of  are there's er any, any driving would be good
Yes it would.
No matter what I do.
Yeah.
But checking this slipping the clutch in first.
Yeah.
Cos, when you try, if you try and control it on the accelerator it's very, it's really jerky
Yeah.
or it's very difficult to keep it smooth
Yeah .
I won't say it's really jerky, but it
I can do it, but I've been driving for two and a half years
Yeah, yeah 
and then it's 
I 
And I can only just do it
Yeah
It's very, I mean the foot control is very, very .
And it's so much easier to put some reeves on than use the clutch .
It is.
It is .
But then again, you've got to feel a bit careful there because it can misconstrued totally
Mm.
if, but I mean if your obviously doing it and you  more moving the clutch up and down
Mm.
then fair enough.
Mm.
You know?
He said something and I couldn't make sense of it
What did he say?
because he said  that  when I came into that corner I pulled in  I'd slowed too much  and then had to drive round, drive round the corner with my left foot flat on the floor  and I thought oh, shouldn't your left foot be flat on the floor when you corner and that's probably what he was getting at, as I could off been slipping the clutch.
Yeah  
But when he said it, I thought  oh I thought I had to have my left foot flat on the floor when I cornered, cos in second you have too.
Yeah.
In second it's cut and dry
Yeah.
You've got to have your foot flat on the floor before you corner.
That corner is an absolute horrible
Yeah I know.
it does, on the corner
Yeah
and that one you've got to drive it definitely than most corners
Yeah.
so you, you can't treat that as an ordinary left handed turn,
No.
it is very 
But if you can't cope with it.
You've got to be able to cope with it .
You've got to be able to cope with it.
Yeah.
But you've got to treat it as a special case
Yeah.
and you've got to 
No, I , I won't tell you how I was taught to do it because I was taught to do it very differently.
Mm.
I was taught to do it in first and use the accelerator.
Mm.
You know.
Yeah.
Mm  so, cos he said it'll help.
Help with your accelerator control .
With your accelerator control , yeah .
So it's diff of course there's  courses giving 
yeah ,
instructors different ways of teaching you.
yeah.
He said 
You , you need fine control on the clutch ,
Mm ,
but you also need it on the accelerator as well 
yeah.
and he said well, okay, with your reversing and everything else your getting the front control on the clutch
So yeah 
this will help you to do it on your 
do it on your accelerator  
accelerator.
whereas 
So,
I, I finding the control on the accelerator difficult
yeah
in first, erm, and I've got some fine control on the clutch and I can use that to deal with that particular corner.
Yeah.
Perhaps.
Yes.
That's just what he's saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Any rate.
Yeah.
See you later then.
Yeah..
I see you later than, oh where's the car keys I had them on the  .
There we are, I was hiding them with my hand.
Yeah, I know, do you want a cake or is it not too naughty?
Christine can you turn that volume down a bit, it's up too high.
. Yes you want to take it .
.
do your hair.
Bye.
Bye.
Where is it?
.
Oh yeah.
.
No, but it's near 
Where about's in  where about?
I don't know  it's not far away.
I wish I could go there .
It's landed.
Has it?
Yeah.
Do you know, do you know where it is?
Not really , anyway I'm gonna get started, ok.
Hello.
Hello.
There's a cauliflower and a bag of potatoes left, ok .
Ok, I'll go and get them.
It's alright, I'll go and get them.
Ok..
Oh.
I read the instruction  again about this thing.
Yeah.
It actually says record all your conversations.
Oh, are you?
I don't know how that all worked with work, because erm, they may not want me too.
Well, you can't do it if they, if they don't want you to
So er, that's right, I'll check 
You can do what you can do 
I'll check it out with the manager.
Yeah  see what he means?
Yeah.
I'm gonna take mum out on Monday
Yeah.
And were gonna get some more Christmas stuff on 
Mm, mm.
and a few drinks.
Ah, that sounds ok .
And chocolate, you know what I mean?
Your gonna take the stamps?
Yeah.
Right.
Sorry I've been a while, I went into mum's to take her shopping in and Uncle Philip was there.
That's alright .
Oh right.
And having, seeing as we see him so rarely now
Mm.
I ah, look, don't say anything to Christine .
Ok.
and I bought those, because you know Jane came up?
Yeah.
and she ate two of the vegetable ones 
Mm, mm .
well there's two left in there and that's not enough for you and I
Right.
so I thought we could have two, one of those each and five fingers.
Yeah, ok.
So .
You know I dug the information out again, I've had a read through of it, and it actually says, were asked just to record all your, all your conversations.
Yeah.
So it's not for me to sort of sit quietly and listen to, record other people, so it's my conversation they want.
Yeah.
Well it's other people as well I think, but, I believe you don't have to sit down  conversation on your on do you?.
No, not very often.
unless there's something seriously wrong 
Where, unless somebody's fallen asleep or something has bored somebody to death.
.
Erm, now what am I doing?.
You don't want one of these do you?
Yes I do, that's why I put the kettle on.
Right aha.
Erm, I better put these in the freezer for now hadn't I?
Yeah.
Cos were not going to do Christine's two straight away.
No,hot dogs tonight so do you mind having eh
No not at all.
right, I'll light the oven.
Mm.
Give it a chance to warm up, we needn't put it in for a bit.
No.
Sorry I was a long time I didn't
That's alright.
Eh  started chatting told him you've got a photograph of  for you.
Aha.
He said when were moving her bedroom around, if he, if we give him a shout he'll come over and help.
Oh, that's helpful .
Cos of taking the wardrobe of it and what have you.
Right , yeah.
I must admit I would be grateful cos if anything goes wrong
You can't get it back together .
can't get it back together
Yeah .
It'll be shameful to ask her
Yeah.
And then were, were, sort of D I Y .
Yeah.
Ooh, and mum also
Mm, mm.
this, you know with been thinking of Chris Causeway at the erm place too go.
Mm, mm 
M F I.
Mm.
And it's, it's the colour she wants, and not only has she got drawers, but she's got shelves down that side as well.
Yeah, that looks good.
Look at .
Yeah  I know M F I isn't far from er you.
No,.
There was a M F I along
There isn't any more it was right opposite me.
Oh it's gone ah, right.
it's not there any more.
Ok.
But we can get her, that  Christine  Christine.
Yeah.
Come and see, you know originally you wanted a white desk, not a black one.
Yeah.
Do you like the look of that with book shelves down the side there?
Yeah.
Yeah, you've got three doors which is more storage space than the other one, cos the other one only had a cupboard down  had no drawers, what's the matter?
Doesn't like it, you prefer the other one?
Yeah, I do.
It's just that you, your better of space if you have that one and you can books down there or on them whatever you want too  and if you had that one, you'd be able to have a, erm another cupboard as well probably.
Is it cheaper?
Well .
It's only cheaper because it's in a sale, it's been reduced down from forty pounds, it was forty pounds before.
No, if, if she didn't like it then we 
Well you can go and have a look if you like 
A .
If you don't like it it's up to you .
No I'm .
What's up?
Nothing.
What's up? there is, we can tell, what's the matter?
Tell us.
I like that one and now you've put me in a difficult position cos I like that one, have that one, but I like the lockable cupboard on the other one.
Lockable cupboard? there isn't a lockable cupboard .
Yes there is .
Yes there is .
Is there.
Yeah .
Yeah .
Yeah, but the other one, remember it was a choice of two wasn't it?
I thought we were getting her the one with the drawers  one with a lockable cupboard is,
Well , is a bigger one.
is a bigger one.
Yeah 
I thought we were getting her the one, but the only thing is the other has got drawers both sides hasn't it? if I remember rightly.
Just one side  I tell you what, let's take you, don't do that, or you'll break it off, let's take you and you can have a look at this one.
Why do you want a lockable cupboard?we don't  well it's very , so why do you need a lockable cupboard?
Cos I just need one, I just like it 
Well I don't think that one will fit in your bedroom in any case, having looked at the size of the wardrobes and the site of the gap that you've got.
No it was the other one, with the t , with the drawers that, that would er
That we thought was best 
Smaller one 
Well let's have a think, we'll, we'll have a think and then have a look, if we go up there it's a huge furniture place, they won't have just one they'll have more than one ok?
How about that?
Yeah.
I said, they won't just have one designer desk will they?
No, we'll have a look around, and see what they've got.
If they  just furniture ok, whereas Argos do a lot of other things as well, so if we take you over there you can have a look see if there's anything you really fancy.
I know it's awful  making you actually have to  decide for yourself .
I, I .
I like the one with the lockable cupboard door, but I like that one as well.
I don't think that one will fit in .
Yes.
If they took out one of these drawers and have a lockable cupboard I'd have it no questions.
Yeah, well let's go and have a look, ok.
Mm.
Don't make up your mind one way or the other, cos were have to take our tape measure.
that bit of icing.
No.
What's that?
Go on.
She's after h , our cake .
Have a gingerbread man.
I want some icing.
There's icing on the gingerbread man, your not .
.
After our cake is she?
She's asked for the icing of off our cake not our cake and she's not having it.
Do you want a gingerbread man with your cup of tea?
.
Oh, told you, got to eat all her dinner, oh, wow, gee 
Well, she had a chocolate biscuit, she had one of those snack things and an orange chocolate biscuit
Mm.
and I said well if you have that now, you better eat your dinner.
Ah.
And that was well erm,ha about an hour ago now.
I see, torturing that child again aren't you?.
That's right, I've been exceedingly cruel to her.
Childline, Childline  Den got us a Hovis loaf it looks  than the other one.
Mm.
Now .
Mm  
to have a gingerbread man if you want it otherwise let daddy    Oh what's this Bedknobs and Broomsticks?
Yeah, on tape   You know this  ah, it's the, the actual letter says we would like you to do, what we would like you to do is to record all your conversations with other people except telephone conversations over a, over a one week period, erm, but that's, that's not, doesn't quite,just need to record as much as I can.
Yeah.
Which is fair enough, that's what I'll do .
I just wondered why I heard a noise,the gerbils running .
Oh, yeah .
That's right.
It doesn't say anything about background noise or anything.
No.
So,television's on, radio's on or something.
.
Yeah.

No.

Tape.

Yeah.
might be different.
That's right, so we'll have a look at it shall we?
Mm  That was  second tape is it that one?
Yeah, second tape .
It actually says that it, to only tell people if they ask what your doing.
Cos if people know there being recorded they tend to
I must admit I wondered.
Mm.
Because, it gets ridiculous and everyone gets very  into what there saying.
Yeah.
You know, and they  long conversation with each other were they get used to it.
Mm, yeah 
Oh it says in here explain what you are doing when you are recording the conversation you will need to explain to the other people involved what you are doing and why.
Mm, mm.
Ah, it maybe that  after the conversation has finished unless they ask you directly what you are doing.
That's what I, that's what I said, yeah  and they say that if your just walking around, unless your actually on your own 
Yeah.
Mm, pardon me, it's just, it, it pays just to run it, just to keep it going continuously 
I must admit you'll get through the tapes a lot quicker that way won't you?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Oh, Big is on.

I'm er  I'm gonna erm, I might see if I can record some conversation on a bus, but I don't know.
Jack.
Sorry.
If I get Jack and somebody on the bus I might pop my hand inside my brief case and press the recorder  where's that cameraman hid then? oh it's built into the dashboard, yeah 
she's  
She's trying to be very nice and she's really fuming  Have you er finished with your tea?
I get you another 
Never mind when you come to  .
Yeah, look forward to that .
I'm not erm, I'm not going to be in a situation to record all my chat anyway, I don't think, because of the erm, the amount of it, when I'm running a course I do an awful lot of chatting during the day.
Yeah, well I mean even if you recorded as much as you can, if, you've got twenty tapes
Yeah.
so you've got plenty of er
Yeah.
I mean, when if you  .
And also I don't , I don't want it to be a barrier either.
No, well the thing is you, to be honest you forget about it don't you?
You do, yeah.
Just  explain and see what people say.
Mm.
If anybody asks us, you can tell them.
Yeah.
I'll have a quick, I have a word with Pauline on Monday see what she says.
Yeah.
And the thing is do, information about then if it procedures  for fraud, that's the problem.
That was brilliant..
We can record us going to work and coming home and on weekends .
And erm conversations erm at
At lunch time .
lunch time tea break time, things like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, you can have ask Pauline see what she says, but 
Mm 
But, erm, actually it would be probably be nice for you if you could record it in your training session because you can take  in your pocket and sometimes you, you can get a better idea of how it's
Mm, yeah.
How you sound and how it goes if you can
Mm.
do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
If  light bulb .
The light bulbs gone.
that one went the other night 
.
Oh dear, isn't that rotten?
He's got little  shorts on.
Yeah.
Do you want to play a game with me?
Well, well, what, what we've got to go and put the dinner in my darling.
I gotta get your dinner.
.
Oh you poor thing..

Did you?
Er, ok, you tell me again.
.
Well I'm sorry Christine I've got to go and get dinner.
Yeah.
Grandma's be around here in about an hour.
The only reason I can er play is that, your dinner won't take very long to get.
you always , it's difficult  when were sat down doing nothing you don't ask.
Can you change your game, so you can play it with thr with two?
No, what you do
Mm, mm.
is erm, well you do it, you've got one Joker in pack right, and you mix them up and you deal them out and you look at your cards, if you've got a Joker
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah
then, then you, everyone's got to mix up there cards again
Mm.
You've got to put them in the order so you can see him, but the other person can't
Mm.
and you've got to pick someone to choose out your card, and they don't know if you've got the Joker or not
Mm, mm.
and they've got to pick one of the cards and they might get the Joker.
Right, I see.
But, the trouble is you can tell who's got the Joker when there's two, because if you haven't, you know the other person has.
Yeah.
But if you've got more than one person then it's harder.
Mm, we could play pairs if you like.
Snap?
Yeah, can play snap.
I put the same cards oh  and we can play .
Well, I won't, I'll play one game with you and then I'll go and get your tea  alright?

And then not record anything to do with the procedures, although there are some things that will probably be ok to record.
Yeah, that's it, I mean, you, you've got to  job,.

Yeah I mean she  probably would be wise to mentioned it to her.
Yeah.
Cos if she saw you with it on
Mm.
doing, running her lecturers
Mm.
she might get  what she's doing you know.
Yeah.
So it would probably be better to mention it to her, but say you'll be discreet, not record anything that .
Yeah.
I mean there are certain things like, the general conditioners to benefit, which erm, are alright, but there are other things that I know about and that I will pass on to people to look out for that I wouldn't want  eh, that you wouldn't want eh, erm, outsiders to know.

No, good ones move on so fast don't they?

Mummy .
Oh, Brian took me round that corner, right, slowed down too much

They said what's that, what's that, it's margarine every single bit right, and  was wearing the balloon it was  in his eyes.
Aha, ha.

Oh got to .
I nearly got involved in that at one time, I's about 
You .
yeah, I's about ten like that, when I was about eleven 
Mum I thought 
There's a metallist girl who was interested in it, she wanted me to be her partner  mm, went along once or twice but
I've got a
two left feet.
Weren't impressed.

No.
I've got a  hour.

One girl there, she's in our group she had brilliant , really good singing voice.

Well she was a dancer, but eh  .
Well, she's a dancer, singer all sorts  acting 
You have to work  hasn't she?
Raise me foreheads be careful there.
Yeah, strong.
Ya, straight on the floor.
Mm.
She had her foot up touching his ears, he had his ear like that.
I must admit I was never very good at dancing but, I was good at catching.
and they dropped you  yes .
Never dropped anyone.
But, just that you couldn't keep up with them .
Step on there feet, yeah.
.
.
.
.
lift me up, lift me up and I went back  and I went back and I, I   fell .
Mm.
Was she .
I know but she still lives there,drop me then, she dropped me .
Oh save him a bit of it.
No.
Ah I've forgotten his chip, his looking all
Cos you've eat it all.
Yes, yes.
You've been cruel.
Oh.
.
Your licking your lips and you haven't got a chip have you?
Go on dad 
Got one, say thank you..
.
Aha, cup of tea?
Ok.
Oh aren't they lovely?
What the  jugs?
The jugs yeah.
Didn't see them properly.
They were like bunches of oranges and lemons
Oh.
if you know what I mean
Yeah I know.
.
In ceramic?
Yeah 
A what?
A Pocket T V.
Pocket T V.
.
A radio, the  the cuddly toy er
Good grief she's got a good memory.
The coffee maker, the  the  er  
God, she, she was brilliant.
She got an awful lot of things didn't she?
There's a really good game we did at, at  Rammore for remembering people's names.
Yeah.
And they, it was a bit frightening because we were in a group of seventeen and see what I mean when, I mean how it starts is like if were starting with me, I have to say I'm Tony, right, and then you would say I'm Jackie and this is Tony and then Christine would say I'm Christine this is Jackie, this is Tony, I was at the end of a group of seventeen  and I had heard it sort of, you hear it, it builds up round the room
Yeah.
We've had a game like that .
So that you can in the end, when I came to do it, although it was seventeen people I didn't find it too difficult.
No, cos you just remember the order that you went round the room in and .
That's right, well no, these were people and, some of the people I knew, some of the people I hadn't met before.
Ah.
Daddy.
And so I had to sort of go round the room and say I'm Tony and this is, and go all round, and I got round the room.
.
Yeah.
So you did quite well.
But I was surprised that I got round the room, cos I'm awful at remembering names  I think I'm gonna have to try and
Dad do we have to  we have to come up with a name.
Mm.
With a first name, so I said her and Chris
Oh yeah 
The man said .
Mm.
 

Erm, but, we had a, that was, that was quite good, but I must, there's a trick to remembering names, and that is that you use it all the time, so any time, if you want to remember somebodys name, every time you see them you say hello and there name
Yeah.
and that sort of imprints it on you.
Yes.
Cos I've noticed there is an awful lot of people do that to me.
Yeah.
I'm terrible for people's names
Mm.
I'm absolutely hopeless.
Places, I can tell you I know somewhere looking at them and I think where do I know you from
Yeah.
Names ooh.
Yeah.
And that, that can be difficult in training because you see so many people and they spend the week looking at you and they've got one name to remember, but you've got eight or twelve names to remember
Yeah.
and you see them a three weeks later and they say hello Tony and you think hello, who the hell are you?.
My watch is breaking up.
Breaking up.
Yeah.
What the strap?
No, the case.
, oh, the case.
, fit this in already,so, you know the other side.
.
Where the strap goes into the case.
The other side, the  
Oh oh I see.
See the bit lifting?
Yeah, I can.
Missing a little bit missing bit further along as well.
Daddy I thought .
What you doing .
Erm, I think if they killed a shark 
Well they yeah, they, they killed Jaws about  .
Yeah, but there's an awful lot of sharks about.
Yeah, but they reckon that this is the same shark,he's killed twice now.
Well it was killed in Jaws.
It was killed in the second one as well.
But there's lots of great white  .
Cos this is the fourth film.
Yeah, I know, it was killed in the one where it got trapped in the .
That's right.
And it was killed in the first one, that was two .
Yeah .
But, there's thousands and thousands of great .
Oh, I don't know how people can eat fish like that.
No, I can't, it'll, if you don't take the head of it I can't eat it, I couldn't even, I have prawn cocktail  and you have a prawn, they put, they put a prawn on top whole, I couldn't eat that, I could have peeled it, I looked at it and I thought about it, no, I can eat them when there done
Yeah but not.
but not when there not done 
Oh remember when I was squeezing that .
I haven't heard a word of this so far.
Sorry.
Not a single word .
It looks really weird seeing Christmas and it's hot and they can go swimming and .
Yeah .
That's right.
I really don't think I'd like that Christmas and it's cold toesie's
Mm.

There are.

For I'm afraid my 
I 
love there are, till it becomes automatic ,
Mm .
it could take a little while.
I pulled up fairly tight behind a car
Yeah.
and then I was trying to come out and I started to pull out into a gap and Brian said oh know, don't pull out  I said oh okay, he said the thing is your fairly tight so your gonna have to come out slowly so you need a bigger gap than otherwise.
Yeah.
And the gap wasn't really big enough, do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
It would off been o okay if I just been able to pull out and drive down the road
Yeah.
because I had to pull out round the stationery vehicle as well, I would off taken too long getting out
Yeah.
and I'd have caused the other one to slow down.
Yeah, there's a lot to this driving business unfortunately.
.
So while your trying to do it, it, you .
Yeah.
I've pulled the old greens out.
Good.
They didn't seemed to have that much of it actually.
No, it's erm  it's sometimes .
It depends how they have to feel it .
Oh, can you .
Yeah  Oh 
Ah, you'll find some cupboard .

Ah

I wonder, I wonder what they get from some people you know.
Sorry.
Must be fun.
Yeah.
Cut all our naughty bits out.
.
.
That's right.
I do find I'm conscious of it a lot of the time.
Other people probably can forget about it cos I'm wearing it, I feel conscious of it a lot of the time.
I'm not, I must admit I don't think about it now, so if  wearing it puts you off.
Yeah.
You know what I mean, it's taking you .
What I'll do when I'm, if all the if signs and buts are covered, I will put the mike on it's stand when I'm working tomorrow, put it on the desk and put the recorder in the, in my briefcase underneath the little desk
Yeah.
cos there's a little coffee table sort of thing that I put my script on
Yeah.
and put my brief case underneath it
You'll have to take it home.
and the microphone on to on top.
Have you read it again and realised what you're supposed to do you'll have to take some spare tapes in and spend lunch times  won't you?
Yeah, but that's, just one, I mean I'm not gonna record, if I try and record the whole of the course
You can't.
I can't.
True,.
That's right, but
Because ok, yeah stuff remains anonymous
mm
but you're giving people how, how to defraud benefit.
yeah, I can't do that.
Erm, so  you've got to do that.
No, oh, a lot of the session's when they're talking about data types and things like that  oh I don't know, cos there's security aspects to that you see.
Yeah, but then, if it's obscure that nobody apart from someone working in the office that'll understand it, does it matter?
The only way it would matter is that somebody breathes the information to, if they could get hold of a card, and get into an office, they could actually use the information to make a payment.
If they knew how.
If they knew how.
Mm, yeah, but be honest for what you're using, for what you've said, would they pick up that, with not having 
Not unless .
a computer in front of them and being able to look at it and do what you're saying?
No.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I'd, I'll have to blank it out the part when I'm talking about passwords and things as well.
Yeah.
Cos they're all passwords that protect the system.
Yeah 
Yeah, but apart from that, you're right.
Yeah it's like ours we've got passwords.
Mm  yeah and then everyone's got their own, I've got my own personal one as well.
We've got our own personal one too, our .
Mm  no, mines more boring than that.
Is it?
My pin number.
Oh.
I use my bank pin number, that way I don't forget it .
Oh I see that, that's how you remember, oh the other day I went to look at Asda you know, put my card in the machine and my mind just went totally blank, do you think I could remember the dam number.
.
I stood there, in the end I keyed in a number which was one digit wrong
Mm.
and I thought, it came out erm, incorrect pin number, please remove your card, I thought  at least I'm getting it back you know so I whipped it out, I said to mum, I'm gonna have to pay for this with a cheque, I said, I can't get the cash out, and she, she said why, and I said I, I forgotten my number , I was getting in quite a panic cos I knew I didn't have it written down anywhere at home.
Yeah, mm.
Do you know what it is now?
Yeah, I remembered it while I was walking round the shop, cos the more I yeah, the more I thought about it the worse I got when I stood by the machine.
That's alright then.
Cos I know yours, yeah, yeah
So I took my card and went in I thought well I'll pay for this by, by cheque
Yeah.
Erm, but I wanted some cash, so what I did in the end was walked round Asda remembered it, or thought I remembered it, came back out put the erm card back in and the terminal came up erm  it's ok.
nervous now, you're gonna be checking that quite a bit.
Yeah the terminal came up erm, due to an error were unable to complete your transaction, so I thought oh great, so I can't have my money in any place
.
then I felt a real twit, cos a man came up and I said I think something's gone wrong with the auto bank machine, says I, it won't give me any money because it's, it's coming up there's an error, so he said well I'll try and see, he says, he put in exactly the same card as me, he had the Midland card, put it in, got his money
.
so I thought, right, I'm not going to be beaten, so I got, went back in again, put the card back in, gave me my money that time.
Mm.
But, it, it wasn't saying I'd made, made an error
No.
it was saying due to an error
There's probably some disruption to the  to the transmission or something for an .
Yeah.
Cos it only needs 
But I felt such a twit, cos I said to this man I, I don't know about you, but I can't get my money.
it only needs for a little bit of attention on a wire or something
Yeah.
to just make it erm, shut out just for a split second
Yeah.
and it'll throw the whole thing.
But that was not a good day  .
no  .
Oh, no I put a six where a five should be, in my pin number, that's all I did, but I just, I just stood there and my mind just completely went blank, I couldn't remember it at all.
And I'd already pushed the card in
Yeah.
so I had to key in something.
Mm, oh I , I'd turned round, I can't remember what it was  oh, what was it all about?
I was doing a training session and I said erm  I'd, I'd started to say something and I'd done it, I was talking about something and I hadn't done the bit before
mm.
so they couldn't understand what I was saying, do you know what I mean?
Yeah,.
and I said  erm,
Do you want to make .
forget all about that, just let your mind go blank and I look round and I said cor that was quick .
.
Cos they're all looking pretty blank anyway you know.
Yeah,.
Ooh 
Well I don't think information about the, the seven, what are the seven conditions of receipt of benefit and things like this would be a State secret.
No, unemployed dirty old thing,living in a caravan, with a big dog  Sorry.
Big, hairy and stroppy, you'll get whatever you like.
yeah .
.
Oh yeah,, big, hairy, stroppy, dirty thing whatever you like.
Not quite true, but
Go on   doesn't it make you sort of  bias when you actually work for the system?
Erm.
And you see the nice people coming in and not getting really
Mm.
what's due to them, see somebody coming in threaten to punch somebodies lights out and they get all the
Yeah.
you know?
But then, to my mind, the person that who, who threatens to punch the lights out and gets whatever they want, everyone should get the degree of service.
Yeah, but the don't, and unfortunately it's the nice people that suffer.
No , but it's up to the every individual to try and make sure that they do get that level of service.
So what are, yeah but, if to get that level of service you've got to threaten somebody
Yeah well you, you shouldn't have to threaten somebody to get good service.
no, but you do have to.
You shouldn't.
No, but you do, in the, in the end.
Depends on the people.
Mm.
Depends on the actual person you see and what their attitude is.
Yeah.
And I must admit once I'd been  I'd, early on when I didn't know an awful lot, then, yeah, but, later on when I had been more experienced there wasn't, there was very little difference between how I treated people whether they made a fuss or not.
Yeah, that's right, well that's the way it should be
Mm.
but you're in the mi minority in, in actually
Mm.
doing that and saying that, and that's wrong.
Mm, yeah, I'm 
But ,
trying to do something about it.
yeah.
.
That's right, I mean the thing is you train people to do it properly
Yeah.
they then go back to their office and unfortunately a lot of what other people in the office are doing are taught
Yeah.
and that I think really have more of an influence, cos they're not going to change themselves into an individual
No.
by doing something different to everyone else.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
They're not in a situation where they can take an individual line at that point.
No.
It's only later on when they're more experienced that they can actually say, well hang on a minute  I can do more for this person  and I'm going to do more for this person.
But I think that's the only thing were, if I worked in a benefit office I wouldn't get on very well, because if I saw something  I'd try and move heaven and earth to make  everything to go right for me .
And that, and that would make you good.
Yeah, but in the beginning I'd get criticized for not being quick enough in my  ,
I don't know .
because I'd chase people round to find, till I found out what I wanted to know.
Mm, yeah.
Do you know what I mean.
The sort of things I'm talking about, I'm, I'm thinking of is ok somebody, a mistake's been made, somebody hasn't got their payment out
Yeah.
alright, and the difference between that is er and then the degree of service that they get, erm you can say you'll get it in the post two days in, in two days, or you can say erm, we'll get a giro cheque written out for you, initial it to you at the counter
Mm.
at half past three  or you can say  if you'd like to, if you'd like to wait for half an hour, we'll get a giro cheque to, issued to you or if you'd rather you can come back at half past three and collect it.
Yeah, that unfortunately the majority of people say you'll get money in a couple of days, then the person would start to argue, because they need their money now to go and buy their shopping.
Yeah, yeah  and that's   degrees of service
Yeah.
I mean that, in that situation I would try and say sort of 
Me, I, I know .
Do you need the money urgently?
Mm, and they're always going to say yes aren't they, unless they're a reasonable human being and has got a bit of money they can use .
Yeah , yeah, only erm 
But I must admit, I, I am a bit snobbish in it, I would move heaven and earth to help someone who  looked clean and nice and had good manners.
Mm.
If it was someone coming in with a nasty attitude really filthy, scruffy, dirty, no fixed address because they lived in er  er, an old wagon some where
Mm.
I think I'd be less inclined 
Yeah.
but having said that, I'd still give them
Only thing is dealing with the awkward people 
Shall I get down?
Yeah, yes please.
that distinguishes a professional to somebody who isn't.
Oh yeah, I, I'd give them the same options but
Ow!
with someone who's nice, put it that way, I'd almost definitely try, I'd get the, say that they could have the giro today
Mm.
Straight away.
With someone who's not I'd try and get them to wait for a couple of days and then if they wouldn't I'd go through the  and get them it today.
Mm, mm.
Do, do you see the difference?
It wouldn't be, I wouldn't say oh no you can't have it, but I'd say well you'll receive it in a couple of days time and if they said oh well that's not good enough, then fair enough, you, you know.
Mm.
But somebody who's nice I'd think no, why 
Mm .
should they have to wait because  but the, I, these people they are , they've opted out of society, they want nothing to do
They don't ,
with society apart from the giro cheque on paper
yeah well they don't
they want
you don't have problems with their payments.
no, no it's, it's the people that think the world owes them a living, but they don't want to give anything back and that really bugs me.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Mm, mm, yeah, I must admit I wouldn't, I agree with what you say, where I wouldn't classify those people as being of no fixed abode, they're not necessarily of no fixed abode, there are a lot of people who would, living in flats and Council houses and things like that, they've got that attitude
Who .
and some of the people who were no fixed abode, actually trying very hard to get work.
Mm, no, by no fixed abode I didn't mean, I did say the .
Mm.
It's the people that get
No, but, even, even some of those  erm the only thing is they tend to get work and they tend not to tell you they've done it .
No, it, no it's the one's that have opted out and they don't try to get work and they don't want work
Yeah.
those are the ones that I'd be, cos it's obvious, I mean, they've done no work in the past sort of twelve months
Mm.
or nearly twelve months, and they're not trying because whatever people say, they do, the works there.
Mm.
You've only got to go to the Job Centre and see all the jobs.
Mummy.
I mean
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
Yeah, that's not bad.
Right, erm, mum
Yeah.
Do you know with this model,those paints  with got to get it done by this Friday .
Alright, I'll try and sort something out tomorrow.
Ok.
Ok, only I haven't got time today, if we can do the  that today look, might as well get done really.
It is, it is a bit more complicated than that,
Mm.
in that er, some people would like to work, but the level, the amount of money they need coming in, is not in line with the amount they can realistically expect to earn, and that's a difficult situation.
Yeah, but then they've got to adjust their life style.
Mm, erm, yeah, you can't adjust your life style by killing a couple of kids,
Oh no ,
that's the only problem , if you've got a large family and you've had a well paid job and then you loose it
yeah
erm, and you're not likely to be able to get into that line of work again
Mm.
it, it can be quite difficult,
Mm.
but there are, what there wasn't before, that there is now is these, erm 
But, then, as I say , if you've got a fam if you, if you can get a job  and you, you, it's their just life style adjusting.
well no, because what you can do know is you can go to somebody who will sit down with a mini computer and that's what you need, a mini computer and will sit down and will look at a job and will say right, if you take this job, it can also claim Family Credit of so much, and, and they actually do a, a sort of alternative benefit calculation, and what they do is they look at, if you take this job and take all the other things into account, will you be better off?
Mm.
Mm.
And they'll actually sit down and work that out for people and encourage them to go for a job and give them all the forms they need to claim Family Credit or whatever.
Well that's what I was gonna say, if the system works properly there's no way.
But sometimes people fall through the cracks
Mm.
and if, you can actually have somebody go, who's interested in going for a job, and when you do that sort of calculation they end up they're gonna be worse off.
Yeah.
And that shouldn't be allowed to happen, but it does.
Yeah.
Because it doesn't su , it doesn't match the whole, there, there are holes in it .
Yeah, so, so what happens then if they say I'm not even going to that interview then because I couldn't live on it, even with all the other benefits, what happens then?
Right, erm
See this is it, they get punished then, don't they, for not  for not trying.
Well, erm, as I understand it er calculations for  in work benefit at erm, by somebody who's separate from the normal benefit section
Mm.
and I don't think they, they will pass on information about somebody actually refusing to take a job
Because of the pay.
because of the pay.
Oh 
But, the system ought to be water tight, so that people are better off
Mm.
but the trouble is it's so complicated there are always exceptions and problems that cause
Yeah, but I mean, be honest, you, you say that, but people have got to be prepared to adjust as well.
Oh yeah.
Because you say someone with a large family and they need a lot of money, you see someone with a large family
Yeah,.
Child Benefit or something like that
Mm, mm.
and they're not given a large amount of money
No.
and there's somebody else saying oh I need five hundred pounds a month more than that, to live  and you think well, hang on
Well.
You, know, if, if these two people with the same number of kids can live for this
yeah
why should this person need five hundred pound a month more.
What you've got to take into account is that, an all, there's an awful lot of things that you get when your unemployed that stop when you find a job.
Oh yeah, cos I mean I know they pay mortgage for you, well not mortgage, but interest on your mortgage.
Interest on mortgage, yeah.
So you've certainly got to erm start paying the mortgage again.
mm.
Also if you're in rented accommodation you're claiming housing benefit, you'll probably haven't got to pay any rent, specially if it's Council there's relief, relief from paying 
Provided, if your pay is that low .
community charge, which you don't get any more once you start working.
Well you do.
Well
Depending on your circumstances 
it depend, it depending on your circumstances, yeah.
That's what I'm saying you'll still get people who, they don't qualify for any of these benefits  
Yeah .
because of what they're earning
Mm.
and they're still saying they're not getting enough
Mm.
those are the people who need to adjust what, how they're living and they don't.
Mm.
They've got a big car, they've got a big house
Yeah.
you know, say to them buy a smaller house and Phrr, you know you'd never
Mm.
never hear the end of it.
Erm.
I mean it was like Deborah and Dave, can you remember?
I believe, ah , I believe the D S S do look at the situation, but they, before, yeah ,
Do you remember Deborah and Dave?,
before they actually suggest to somebody that they sell a house, that they sell a house and moved to a smaller one, they have to be unemployed for quite some time.
yeah, but I mean they just desperately wanted to get away from Bristol
Mm.
because of what happened with the accident
Yeah.
what have you, and they moved from that really nice house
Mm.
that they had
Yeah.
and that was Deborah's mother's house, that was where Deborah was brought up and where I used to go and play with her when we were little
Mm.
and of course her mum moved to Cornwall and Deborah bought the house of off her, a bit cheaper than they would have bought on the  they moved down to Cornwall and they bought a much smaller house, much, much smaller.
Mm.
I mean she had three or four children
Yeah.
so she's still needed, I think she bought a three bedroomed house which meant she had two girls  two girls and a boy, she had three children.
Aha.
No two boys and a girl, so it meant that two boys have to share a bedroom which they weren't doing in that other house  and David's been unemployed well
Mm.
I say, they did just that, they sold up, moved down to Cornwall where her mum lives and bought a much smaller place.
Yeah.
D S S don't help with the mortgage, at the first I think it's ten weeks as well, but I think  help with the mortgage at all .
Yeah.
Unless people are insured for that sort of period in time any way.
, yeah are we?
I don't think we are.
No, because of the type of job.
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know if we would be.
I don't know, but it's, I don't know I, it's a very difficult sort of situation where you get, there are so many things to look into, and it's not being done well enough
Mm.
basically.
It's very, very complicated.
Mm, it is, but it's still not being done well as
There's no way it should be that complicated  a lot of the problems are caused by the rules being so complicated that you have to be working in that particular field
Mm.
with two or three years before you really know what's going on
Mm.
and in Avon we've got erm  we've got a large turn over of staff
Yeah.
people don't stay out long, so you don't get many people getting up to two or three years experience, the one's that stay on that long stay 
Oh yeah , they, they're very good.
They're, and they're very good and they, they tend to stay a long time.
Yeah.
But then they tend to get promoted and move on to other things.
Yeah, but I, I think the reason I feel a bit bitter about it is living round here, you see all the dirties and the scruffies, you get annoyed, absolute no order, they've crawled into the system right up to and doing openly in front of you
Yeah, mm.
and you think well to hell with it, they should be, come down on hard.
Mm.
You, you know, you 
Yeah ,
just see them all getting away with it and they makes me thing something ought to be done, which has the people that lose out or the people who go in there very politely, fill out their claim
mm.
suffered at home and because of all the dirties and scruffies making a fuss they don't get attended to properly
Mm.
and that's what makes me evil, that's why I say I'd moved heaven and earth for someone who's nice
Yeah.
and  for someone who's not.
Mm.
Because you know dam well that those people, the ones that are not and are making the fuss are probably the ones that lead, need the money least.
Yeah.
Cos er, somebody I can think off with a, not a million miles from here is working and claiming
Mm.
I know that  I mean he's actually thick enough to go up there and sign on in his overalls.
Mm.
Then he says, oh he's working on cars for the family, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Mm.
You know, and you, you know dam well he's, he's defrauded the system.
Yeah.
When, and he'll be the one going up there shouting.
Somebody like Hilary
Mm.
that needs all the help she can get goes up there and
Mm.
gets little  You know it just doesn't seem right at all.
Mm.
Erm  I wouldn't  there are ten per cent, well perhaps less than ten per cent who are absolute loonies.
Yeah.
Erm, but an awful lot of people who would go up and make a fuss  may not get this, the same level of services erm, somebody who went up there and was nice.
Mm.
They might get less.
Yeah, perhaps it's just that I know some of the loonies that go up there and get what they want every time.
Well.
.
The thing is you have to look at your source of information for that.
Yeah.
They might think they're getting away with it, a lot of people who, who, I mean being unemployed isn't, you tend, people tend to feel devalued and so if they can think oh, they've put one over on that, on the er, benefit office, then they'll go and brag down the pub about it.
Yeah.
Whereas in actual fact if they come in very nicely and ask very nicely, they might have got more than they actually got here when they came in shouting and yelling.
Mm, yeah.
, but then, when you come to the lunatic fringe  then supervisor's will cut an awful lot of corners to prevent them busting up the office or punching somebody in the nose, a real, I don't mean people who are just stroppy, I mean the real lunatic .
Yeah, yeah, big red L written on their claim.
.
, I know, ha, ha, I can sue you, you take care.
Yeah, I mean there are some virile people who are mentally sub normal.
Oh yeah.
There are people who are mentally ill, for one reason or another, there are people on drugs, there are people who are alcoholics and when those people come in, in that state, you minimize the areas of confrontation.
So when you say to them sorry you don't get any money because they're not entitled to it what happens then?
Well there's only one thing you can do any way.
Yeah.
You see the  it's gonna happen eventually with all these people, there's gonna come a time where's something gonna happen that they're not gonna like
Mm.
you know,
Mm.
erm, as long as, cos they can only claim benefit for a certain length of time can't they?, then it switches from unemployment to Social Security .
Income Support , yeah, but Income Support, paid indefinitely.
Yeah, yeah.
And Income Support is a lot more than Unemployment Benefit anyway.
It is, is it?
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't think it was.
Yeah, Unemployment Benefit is only forty one quid a week.
Oh.
Or sixty five if you're claiming for a wife,, what good is that?
Well, you said what good is that, it's more than mum and dad's er pension  it's more than dad's pension
Ah, yeah.
and he's claimed .
I don't think you've got that right somehow, there's no way, that retirement pension will be less than Income Benefit, it's always a bit more.
Well, it works out
that's based on National Insurance Contributions.
No.
And dad's in receipt of a, in receipt of a full pension.
Yeah.
Right, he's getting more than sixty, sixty five quid a week.
Yeah, but it's not a lot more.
Ok, it might not be a lot more, it might be seventy.
Mm, yeah.
But it's always a bit more.
Mm.
Because they
They ought to be a lot more that's the thing.
because people who are signing on will er, well,pe he's, he could still claim Income Support.
He can't.
He's got too much money coming in then.
Yeah, cos he's got a private pension of one hundred pounds a month as well.
Yeah.
Cos they get hardly any rent rebate now, hardly any oh, but, well, Poll Tax, they pay nineteen pounds each
Yeah.
which is practically the same as were paying.
It is the same.
Yeah,, they get no relief there, no relief any where else.
Mm.
I mean, I be honest I don't know how they do it, because I do know what they've got coming in
Mm.
I mean they've got their old age pension and dad's private pension and that's it.
Erm, I don't know how they live, yet they always seemed to have enough money  you know.
They get help with the rent?
About one pound odd a week.
Rene said they're twenty four pound a week.
Yeah 
They get practically no help at all and yet mum still manages to sort of save a bit 
Yeah.
and I think well where are they going short, because they must be.
Mm, it's a thought, they seemed to be able to manage ok.
Yeah.
I mean, were, were be in a totally different situation.
Yeah, but then we've got three hundred pound mortgage, which they haven't got, I mean we've got different circumstances.
Yeah, but, we will be totally different situation .
Oh yeah, when , when we retire.
Cos we'll end up with no mortgage, we'll get I don't, I don't know, if I , I must admit I rather fancy the erm, the old er  the erm, a re-employed pensioner, I don't know.
.
It's quite a good one.
What going down to E.O.
Well I can work till I'm sixty two as an E.O.
Yeah.
Or Sixty as an H.E.O.
Would you want to?
What, you could then do which I think would probably help, cos you see you don't get State Retirement Pension till you're sixty five
Yeah.
but what I, what would be a possibility at sixty two, when I'm at that point, I'd be receiving half pay
Yeah.
as a pension, so if I'd retired at that point, and then worked part time
Yeah.
to keep your green matter in the wear
Yeah, yeah.
As an A O somewhere.
Yeah.
So I'll reach State Retirement Age we can, end up with virtually full pay.
Yeah,
When I've, I've got 
that's if I was still working.
I'd be working part time for full pay , if you see what I mean
Yeah, yeah.
and then at retirement age I would continue to receive half pay plus retirement pen State Retirement Pension
Mm.
which be, at the equivalent of about seventy quid a week as well.
Yeah, I h , I honestly think though that when erm  I don't know, you see, cos I, I's been saying oh when I get a chance I'll get a transfer out of my office
Mm.
because of they way it's run
Mm.
but they way it is at the moment, with me able to use the car for work
Mm, mm.
and things, you think is it worth it because the car would be sat out here, if, if say, say I transferred and still did three days but did it when you work
Mm, yeah
in the building you work in
Mm.
I wouldn't be able to use my car
No.
so, I'd have to pay bus fare
Mm.
so I'd be paying, we'd be paying for our petrol which wouldn't be a lot different to what it is now really 
No ,
a bit, two or three pounds a week perhaps
mm.
and I'd be paying a lot more in bus fare
Mm.
plus you haven't got the convenience of being able to go and get in your car
Yeah, cos standing about waiting for buses is not fun.
No, you know, if I could work somewhere in an office where I could use my car
Mm.
then that would be great
Mm.
but you'd want to be able to know that you can  I don't know, I mean, I , I think, with, with the place I am now  I just don't know what to make of it really
No, I think the thing is, is once you, this is gonna sound awful, but once you've done your time and you know as much or more, then you're E O  then you're gonna be left alone to get on with your job.
What do you mean love, we've always been left alone to get 
Yeah ,
on with the job.
what I mean is, that you're not gonna have, erm  you're not gonna have interference like you had lately, ya, not gonna have comments like you had lately.
Huh, there'll always be 
And , and you feel, comfortable with what you're doing, you won't have to erm, you won't have to worry about the work, if you know what I mean, you'll know how to do it.
Yeah.
Once you've got that, I, I think you might well fined that it's quite nice and comfortable to stay there.
Yeah, well this is it, I think 
Rather than, rather than face moving into Benefit where it is very fraught at times and in a situa , and coping with that as well as not knowing what you doing isn't nice.
You, you say it's very fraught in Benefit at times, I don't think you appreciate what I do,
right, you are very busy
no, when you get someone's relative phoning up because they've just been crushed under a lump of machinery, that's is very fraught.
Yeah.
Having to deal with that person
Mm.
why aren't you prosecuting the company because my son has just been killed
Yeah.
and who has to deal with it, da da.
Yeah.
Not, you know, the inspector's are out, where you can't reached them on the phone.
You've never talked about that before.
Oh no, no it happens.
Mm.
Quite a bit.
And that's, that's on a par with the sort of problem we get in benefit
Mm.
and somebody comes in, Aunt Maud has just died, what do I do?
Yeah, yeah.
You think, oh , and it 
Yeah, but , the thing is with that it's very different because,, it's not your fault
Ok, erm.
erm they're not coming to you and saying, my wife has been killed why aren't you doing anything about it,
No.
they're coming to you and saying my wife has been killed please can you help me which is 
My kid ,
is different.
They're coming to you asking for help
yeah, yeah.
whereas they're coming to us and blaming you
Mm, yeah.
you know
Yeah .
For doing nothing, which is
Yeah.
you know, if the help and safety executive had done this, this and insured that this was right and that was right
Mm.
this wouldn't have happened.
Yeah.
You know, that's a bit different to my wife has died please can you help me 
Yeah , yeah,
sort things out.
another scenario that comes up quite often is that, somebody comes in and say my kids haven't had any food all over the weekend because you didn't send out a giro 
Yeah.
that be a 
Yeah, but mine  they're lying instead.
, well you,
.
you won't  sometimes.
Yes, that means
Yeah, but
my kids haven't had any food all weekend that I've paid for because you didn't send me my giro, they've had their meals because they've been round there at grandma's, but I'm not telling you that, yeah, you know.
Yeah.
I went down the pub on Saturday and drank it, all the rest of my benefit.
Yeah, quite.
But, that's, that's what you're faced with sometimes.
Yeah, I mean.
But, yeah, I mean
I mean we get it as well, it's not, you so sort of say oh my jobs a cosy little job, but it's not that cosy believe me, you get put in some very awkward situations .
no, I didn't, I didn't want to say that.
No.
I didn't want to say that because I didn't, I don't think it is a cosy little job
Mm.
especially with the management's support you get.
Well we don't get any.
That's what I meant .
From the management we get positive hinderance not support.
, yeah, that's what I meant.
I mean, my immediate management,, now in, in a crisis she's brilliant, you see, I, I don't know whether this with this the other day, whether she didn't  go to see Paul to see what I'd say
Mm.
because I'd said this, and I don't know whether she was sussing me out
Mm.
a bit as well, cos I've, I've said that, he's said something to me  and,
Ok.
and I don't know whether she took me down to see him to see if I'd backed down
Yeah.
and I didn't, because he said it.
Mm, yeah.
And I think she was 
No, I ,
quite pleased with me cos she said, don't get irate, don't get upset, and I didn't.
no.
I talked him down at one point
Mm.
cos he kept doing it to me so I did it to him.
Mm.
He wouldn't let me say something and I tried about three times and in the end I just kept talking,
Mm.
it was a case of you stop, let .
Mm.
But I don't know anybody in there who hasn't had a really good shout at him at some point, and that's all, that's including A O's
Mm.
you know, and when Ah 
Yeah , the one thing you have got there is that people are prepared to take him on.
Yeah, they are, Julie will
Mm, whereas, if you 
and Joyce definitely will .
yeah, whereas if you had the situation where people weren't prepared to take him on, it could be awful
Yeah.
you have people leaving hand over fist.
They have now.
Mm.
I mean they've got a job to keep people.
Mm.
Since I've been there, they've had.
Yeah.
I think A.O's, they, they, the A O's tend to stay
Does they tend to have more gumption, they tend to have to stand up to him in the end .
yeah .
Yeah.
But the A O's don't, they've had one, two  they've had one new A A to date
Mm.
in the twelve month's I've been there, just one, and we've had three leave.
Yeah 
You know
Yeah 
I, I don't know it  cos he, he sort of says all this, that we, were very good to people you know, great flexibility and all this 
.
oh yes, you get a hospital appointment then you have the time off it, that's it, they'll 
,
move heaven and earth, you know
so what
so what
.
quite.
If you have a pre he's actually said to me if you have a problem I will listen and I will help you, so there's me going to him and saying look due to a misunderstanding I have a problem and this one saying tough
Yeah.
you know  but it wasn't any misunderstanding either, he said something
Mm.
and now the chips are down and I'm calling on him to do what he said, he's not prepared to
No.
that's what it boils down to, there's no misunderstanding it's him.
Mm.
Him, he, he wanted someone to work there desperately
Yeah.
I was there, I was prepared to do it
Yeah.
and he wanted me
Yeah.
so he offered me the moon to get me
Yeah.
having got me
Yeah, he then starts trying to take it back
yeah, and he's not going to.
No.
So .
He didn't exactly offer you the moon anyway
Well no,


no
But he was prepared to negotiate on something which now he's saying he didn't negotiate.
Yeah, that's right, what, no, he's not saying erm, he's not prepared to negotiate any more
Mm.
he's saying he didn't say it in the first place .
First place , yeah.
He's also saying, but now I have a more responsible job, therefore I have to be in  time, five minutes after him, not good enough.
Mm, yeah.
You know  and, as I say with my partner  I haven't mentioned it yet, this business about cover
Mm.
but it annoys me that, why, you see, I'm, I'm asking for cover for technical half an hour in the morning
Yeah.
Possibly fifty five minutes.
Mm.
Somebody has to cover our group from half past three till five
Mm.
during the week.
Well that's not  time, so it doesn't matter.
No, when your partner 
This,
goes home early 
it's, it's a question it's not a question of cover, and it's not a question of erm efficiency it's a question of small mindedness.
Yes, luckily he's gonna look at all my flexi .
Mm.
The one that's been really bad, is the one that I'm still doing, they can't see that.
Ah, right.
Yeah.
I looked at the other day and I was thinking oh god, I want to go to sleep a couple of days last, you know
Mm.
five minutes, ten minutes, and I was thinking erm,the car broke down
Mm.
well that's all the sheet I'm doing now
Mm.
so he won't see that one.
No.
Keen she is
She is in't she?
.
Got my house keys?
It's up there, I saw it on the door last night.
Oh, was it late?
no .
Oh where is it, this side or the other side?
Erm
The passenger, yeah, grandma.
Just getting used to this damn er choke again
.
No.
They'll service it, and it'll 
They'll service it ,
be all different again.
such a pain, it really is.
I  seemed to do anything to the car, mind with the water pump I think they check, they have to er adjust the timing.
Mm, mm.
When they er put the new pump in, but it is such a nuisance.
You've got to push the choke in now as far as it'll go.
Oh.
The only thing is then you'll run, when you stop and take your foot off the accelerator you risk stopping.
Yeah.
you'll have to give it as little as it you know
Mm.
It seems to be much more sensitive to too much choke.
Yeah, it floods very easily.
Yeah 
Pick, are you gonna pick her up at quarter past,quar , er seven o'clock is it?
Yeah, erm
Okay.
So you could, explain sort of why.
Yeah.
See you later.
Bye.
Be a good girl 
Hello Tony, was Christine okay?
Hello , yeah.
We'll drop her back.
Well we can, we can 
Unless you want her earlier ,
pick her up about seven.
yeah that's fine .
Okay , cos were going out, so we can pick her up on the way out, about seven?
Okay , yeah, is that alright?.
Yeah, that's fine ,
I'm gonna drop the other's back at seven
oh.
We've got Charmaine and  Charlotte, we don't know if Becky's coming round, we've got a video.
Oh, right.
Okay?
Erm.
It's, it's up to you, if you, if you like us to drop her back first at seven
Erm
or we'll hang on until you call for her and then I'll pop these back home, I don't mind, whichever.
Erm.
Or she can stay later it's, it's entirely up to you.
No, were actually going out at seven
You take her out

You say we were on our way out any way .
And I said well were on our way out so she said alright, were hang on and wait for you to arrive at seven and then I'll take the rest back.
Oh the rest, how many has she got there?
I don't know.
I think Becky, I think Charmaine is going, is there as well, so, she's gonna have a house full and they're all gonna sit and watch a video.
going back.
God.
Yeah, brave lady.
Oh my, must admit, gets a bit much of it you know.
.
But then I suppose.
Mm.
Oh I wish we could get all that grass cut, oh.
Yeah, I can't do it can we?
No.
We've had a real sort of little  later you know.
Yeah.
It'll be ideal to do it, but you, actually say you just can't do it all.
Mm 
I suppose being realistic we could clean the car out in the evening because you only got to have the door open you've got the interior light on
Yeah.
you know.
Yeah, you can't clean the outside of the car by the interior light.
Yeah, but then we'll do that in the car wash then .
Yeah 
see it's busy on a Sunday.
Yeah.
I wonder actually if their car wash is open 
Oh, we'll have a look 
Yes, the garage is .
Yeah there's somebody in there now  I'll go and get the ticket.
Get the wax one as well, that'll give some protection as well .
Okay  Wax or hot wax?
Erm, what do you think?
Which is 
That's the hot wax.
What do you think?
We can try that.
Wax, yeah.
Okay  Hello, can I have a three pound fifty car wash please.
There's been .
.
Thank you..
.
There we go.
Thank you.
.
Bye.
You haven't  got the dry on it as well?
Yeah 
It'll give it some form of protection which we haven't got round to doing the erm  oh
Silicone.
yeah.
Yeah.
I mean it says it lasts up to two years, we've only had it on there a year
Yeah.
it's just over a year, so that's .
It all helps if you start the engine.
Right, I'd better go and push the ticket in hadn't I?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
And I've got our aeriel down.
We'll still have to do all round the doors, round the you know.
Yeah.
Not a bumper, all over, number plate, on the front.
The number plate's only hanging on  by one screw .
God.
Every time I come up here I think is the  alright, that one.
It was broken when we bought the car.
Yeah.

You know a lot of these big cars with really wide wheels.

Hello Lorn.
It's all right 
Lorna!
Lorna!
Do you know you're part of a national survey
Why?
On the spoken word.
Why?
Because it's something I'm doing and I've just recorded all our conversation here 
I didn't notice that  the microphone.
I didn't know what it was.
I've got little microphone up here.
Good God.
look 
Like like a survey down  have you?
What have you recorded?
What I've recorded and just letting them have the tapes.
And just keep a record of the time that I recorded it and er a little bit I've just got to give the first names of the people that were talking but it's done anonymously so there's no no problem with that.
You didn't tell him that I got my  
No no no I didn't 
Have a see what it's like.
Oh that was stupid.
Ooh what was that?
That crazy fool run out there didn't he shouting out .
That was nasty.
Bye.
See you.
Bye.
I knew there was some on it.
Oh dear.
Cheerio.
Cheerio.
Yes yesterday she was straining the boiling water off the potatoes.
Hm hm
And it splashed back and burnt all her neck.
Oh no!
Chow!


And she burnt all her neck.
Oh that was a good time to have it on Tony
It was
Conversation on that one 
So you did
I tell you what as well with directions to that place on there as well.
The only thing is I think I'd rather try and er find out now we know it's Fancy Goods and look it up in Thompson's local and then find out the address and then we'll find our own way down there.
Ya.
 

My God!
No those posters all over the boards and there was  head.
No we'd just picked up Christine from her friend's house and I had sort of half a dozen people 
On there yeah
to on there to note down.
Yeah.
Somebody I'd never seen before said hello and
That was Shane's granddad.
Yeah.
Aye.
You got some in there tonight then Tony?
Yeah.
Oh that's brilliant.
Oh I wanted I wanted not being mean I wanted to get Lorna because she's a classic example of the Bristolian accent.
Oh yeah yeah .
Yeah .
And I even noticed that she she was coming out with the thees and thous that that erm
And that's what they want.
Yeah
They want dialects and accents as well as and if you tell somebody you know it immediately stops them .
They don't yeah They talk start talking what they think 
Yeah 
is properly.
The note says sort of don't tell people until after or unless they ask you 
Or unless they ask 
they ask you directly what they're doing and erm
No wonder our Tone went to sit down which he don't usually do.
as you're being my mum you didn't keep us very long.


It was er and when she got worked up about that Fancy Goods place 
It was really
It sounds ever so good though 
It's it's really coming out.
Surprising though cause normally a place like that can need a car 
Car .
Yeah.
The thing is I suppose they rely on word of mouth.
Yeah 
Yeah 
They must do.
Well they don't they keep there prices down because they didn't spend a lot on advertising.
That's right 
How's Windy?
All right.
Are you still still with us?
Still captive is he?
Oh dear.
Seems so funny having a Houdini dog.
Seems so funny having a tall dog after having short dogs.
Yeah
And he's all he's all legs.
Oh.
Oh they're beautiful.
Hm.
It's odd though you get used to them.
Yeah.
He really is all legs.
Oh.
He's got such a tiny little tummy.
Yeah.
Hm mm.
Big chested where their lungs are for running.
Yeah .
Yeah .
And nothing but miles of legs
Yeah .
Oh .
I must admit a whippet was the dog that I originally wanted.
Yeah.
Very timid .
It's just Yeah.
Hm.
The trouble is if you're 
Oh he'll come out 
if you're the only one in house he follows you and you're looking for him and every time you're moving around he's moving around behind you  so you can't find him.
I thought I wonder where the hell's he gone.
. I mean he was he was immediately behind me.
Oh ho ho ho.
Oh.
He just goes around and I can't find him.
You need to take your hand off him and put it round you..
Yeah.
He he he keeps really close up to you when he's following you.
Hm.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh I reckon they lovely.
I really do whippets.
He's got a lovely little face on him.
Yeah.
Cause I'm I'm so used to small dogs.
It seems funny to me.
Yeah .
Yeah .
I you we I got used to Wendy's.
And you I mean people say whippets are not cuddly but they're just as cuddly you know you get used to picking them up .
Picking them up and you get they put one paw on the settee like and I said no Windy and he went 
Oh .
Oh .
Of course when he gets over the timidness he'll probably get up to more mischief.
I'll tell you what if he's six months old you'll have to watch him chewing as well.
Yeah yeah.
Because he'll be losing teeth.
Yeah.
And he'll chew.
I only caught Ben chewing once.
Ben was eight months old when we had him.
He was a bit older
Yeah
And I thought he's quiet and it was about a week after we had no twice.
And once we had it was before we had all our carpet done in the hall
Yeah .
we had a rug at the top of the stairs
Yeah.
And he was chewing the corner of this rug and it was all soggy and horrible 
Yeah 
And another time he went quiet and he was in the front room and when I went in he was chewing the leg of the settee
Yeah.
And that's wood.
And there's still the teeth marks on it now,
Oh yeah 
We can't get rid of them.
a lot about that when you went when they went last year.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Laugh.
Oh yeah that was lovely.
I was worried you wouldn't get the 
Yeah.
You left them in my pocket Remember when we went to Tesco's?
I thought so.
When you went into Tesco's.
I looked in my  the other day and I thought I thought now I haven't got it now.
I I thought I probably put
Put them away.
Huh.
When you were looking at the door
He wasn't looking your way was he?
No.
I expect you to put these in your pocket 
And when I went to go to work I pulled me gloves what I thought out of pocket and was going to put them on and I thought er  
Ooh.
Turn the heating down a just a bit.
Yeah.
Different colour 


Oh no!
It's all new.
Anything you say  menace here.
Cause in the summer when the traffic lights are changing the trees are growing over the ones this side
Yeah you've got an awful job to see
And all you can see is the red at the top on the other side cause the walls in the way.
So if it's green it just looks as if nothing's there  which is a bit of a nuisance.
Hm.
You've got lots of lights on this one Christine.
So that whenever
Oh yeah
They always seem to do a lot just here 
Oh yeah .
This little shop  it's lovely.
It's only a sort of a hi-fi electrical goods place.
It's only a little shop and yet it always seems to have lovely decorations.

You pull one out and whatever it says on there you've got to pick and  if there are a policeman judge victim then you just walk around the room.
If you are the murderer you've got to walk around the room and do that to somebody.
And then they fall down and die and they give a signal er they scream and they pick something up.

Then all of a sudden 
Yeah
You know and
But they are they're pretty docile type of dog but they're a chaser.
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah
 

They tend to like 
We've


Yeah.
And erm with a dog that moves that quickly he's not just a chaser he's a catcher as well 
Yeah
Yeah definitely.
I notice that with Ben.
He saw something erm he saw a cat and he zoomed out the front door and he was gone and it's only when he lost sight of the cat he thought about where he was
Yeah
He just went straight for him and you know he just didn't think about where he was going or anything and he 
And when he comes to look round
He was completely lost


And as it was I could see him and I called him and he looked over and he saw me and he came dashing across all the gardens.
He was ever so pleased to see me.


Yeah.
But  he see a cat and choo he's gone 
Yeah.
You know cause it's all been on here.
Yeah I suppose so.
I first  when I come in this morning Fred was on his blanket.
Then once this morning Fred's bum was on his blanket and Windy curled up by the side of him.
Well they can't be arch enemies to do that can they?
But when he gets up he unwinds.
Yeah.


And curly 
And then he stretches and he stretches so far 
And he gets longer and longer
Yeah
You wonder how much longer he's gonna
Can he get yeah 
He won't get much bigger though from what I Wendy's dog he's nearly there 
Yeah 
No.
He's pretty much all brown isn't he?
I didn't expect him to be quite that big but he
I said to you he was pretty tall.

Shall I take the  out?
Yeah.
Oh year

Oh no.
It says in here six weeks.
Yeah
No with them being so fast it's not 
No.
Yeah but I think it's a period of six weeks.
I mean that gives them time to become accustomed.
He'll go backwards and forwards in that field so often.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He said you weren't to let a new dog off the lead until he had  for six weeks
Gosh!
I think perhaps if you go over the field after Ben she would make 
Yeah.
After about six weeks you know.
He certainly seems to know his way around now doesn't he?
He can find us 
Especially us.
It's the first time he's been brought out this way as far as we know
Yeah
And er he wasn't walked up.
He was brought up in a car.
It's fascinating how he found his way down there.
Yeah.
I though 
He doesn't know where he lives 
Round that  erm  I think he was found may I need to ask?
Oh yeah.
It's not that far is it?
Isn't it funny that Ben come from .

Only Ben's stand right up.
Yeah.
But  flop down.
But Ben's flop down sometimes uh huh.
Most of the time they flop down.
And he's 
Well not like that.
If Ben was led like that he'd they'd be up straight.

I had to sort them all out again so you can see what he got up there.
I tend to put sweat shirts and jumpers together.
Yeah well what I do sometimes I wear a thing just once and I think well it's not dirty so I put it back in.
Yeah.
That's right and a Parker pen.
No no I like a separate pile for sweat shirts and pullovers and jumpers.
Well the proper place is in the cupboard.
It doesn't matter where but as long as it's in the cupboard .
No no .
Oh yes it does.
It matters.
It's bad I know I 
If you go up and want a T-shirt you go to that pile.
If you go up and want a sweat shirt you go that pile.
If I want a T-shirt I don't go to any pile I go to the hangers.
Because I hang my T-shirts up.
Oh 
I hang my shirts and my T-shirts up.
and my sweat shirts and jumpers I I fold up and they're all in together.
Well we don't  together.
It might be  because I keep looking at mine and .
I must sort that out .
Of course ours will be high up
Yeah yeah.
so you can't push anything in the back.
No you you got a more or less get up on something to sort it out.
Yeah so overdue for getting up there and sorting.

That's right
Yeah yeah .
and it's all I mean I use this gel stuff
Hm
which doesn't dry the skin dry the skin out or anything and erm it's just like washing your face with water.
I mean it doesn't  I used to hate it when I was doing plays there and you have er grease paint on and you'd be you'd try and you'd have to cream on your face to get the grease grease paint off .
Get it off .
And so you'd be putting lots and lots of grease and much on your skin and then you get spots.
Yeah
And you'd be trying to shave and you don't want to cut spots.
Err!
Oh!
Horrible!
And the cream actually brought you out in spots did it?
That they were putting on or was it the actual make up or?
Well it's just it's not the the grease the make up or the cream it's the fact that you're you're putting so much muck on your skin all the time and it clogs up pores and causes spots.
Cause you have to put a lot of cream on your face to get the make up off  and you do that especially if you're doing two performances a day  it's an awful lot mess and much you're putting on your face and you can't get it all off 
Done anything about a Christmas presents yet Jack?
Yeah.
which  got a lot more space.
Oh!
Three drawers down one side and it's got it
Oh!
And there's a support the other side is a book shelf.
Oh that's nice.
Hm.
Yeah
got one exactly the same as that except it's wooden.
It's got three doors one side and a book shelf the other side.
Hm.
It's wood.

As same as 
Is it nice?
Yeah.
Where's that Grace is it?

You might be able to decide which side you want it on then Christine.
Yeah
Yeah .
Because if you're right handed 
It's a flat pack Yeah.
Mum is it wooden?
I don't know.
It's erm
Well it er it will be wood but whether it's covered over whether it's wood grain or whether it's white or I don't know.
They might have a selection.

Hm.
So we I think we might go with  mightn't we?
Hm mm.
Hm.

Still making less  
She's more or less  she's er

Desk yeah.
I mean she she might want to buy  a nice desk.
No she's got a desk tidy.
She's got a desk tidy.
Yeah
What might be an idea is to get her some good blotters.
Not ones with blotting paper.
No no I know
Yeah I know.
Yeah because this one because it's easier to write on than er than a wooden .
Yeah it's like er a very a layer of plastic with a very thin layer of sort of felt underneath.
So when you write it's soft.
It's was like you were writing on a writing pad.
Because you don't feel right on wooden table it's quite hard isn't it?
Yeah.
Well it makes it it's a nice soft surface for you to write on.
You mean something like sort of like a board.
Like Daddy had in 
That's right.
Yeah only 
This  After having a think.
I reckon most of your books will go in that bookcase.
Which would mean you could you could have your work
I could put my little shell boxes on top of the shelf.
That's right.
You could put all sorts of little things in there.
But let's wait and see cause I'll take you out and we'll have a look.
Perhaps next weekend.
Yeah.
What is it another free weekend?
Right I reckon I'm going to get

Peculiar.
You'd never think he'd go into that sort of ball.
I must admit they're lovely to cuddle because they do curl up into a ball.
They love cuddling.
Oh yeah.
Let's wait and see.
See what we can get.
If there isn't any chance you could get a 
I'd just love to get that.
Could I?
Make it first on the lead.
No.
Because I think Thursday Daddy'll be working.
Oh yeah well
You've got to have it when  there's least disturbance.
There are  two problems with that.
There are things certain things I'm committed to and  to have  time off means I still got to be able to do those things.
Do you see what I mean?
So I've got to watch that.
But I could manage.
I could certainly manage to have a half day.
Yeah.
And if we we're looking around in town.
Well we will be.
Could I have a day off?
It's a bit late.
Okay but
This is it.
If we going out  
you'd have to you'd have to come and get me and we'd go straight off .
Well the thing is 
Yeah.
The thing is.
The other thing erm is that I haven't got any leave.
Oh hell no!
Of course I've got my leave 
Yeah.
I haven't got any leave.
What I've got enough leave to take the time off over Christmas.
That's all agreed.
But I haven't got any extra.
And I already took a half day off flexi leave .
Daddy'll  we'll have to do it .
I've already took a half day off flexy leave to have my driving test last week
And if you do it on the tenth 
Hm.
Erm and I really want to  I will build up some more time but I haven't got any to take at the moment.
Look we've got to sort your bedroom out first.
First job.
You don't have it till Christmas anyway.
Oh but 
Now I don't get any more leave till February now.
I've got some leave 
You'll have to get it first .
But what I've got booked is that I finish  when's Christmas?
Is it a Wednesday?
I finish the Friday before that Wednesday.
That's nice.
And I don't go back until the Thursday after New Year's day 
New year's day .
That's lovely.
And we've both got that lecture time off and so  but that's used up all my leave.
I haven't got any more to take until after February.
Well how do you feel either tomorrow night?
No perhaps not tomorrow night.
Tuesday night about seeing if we can do a bit more sorting out in her bedroom.
Cause if we leave it all till the weekend we don't do it.
You know what it's like?
Yes.
Specially now Brian's got your driving lessons instead of the middle of the day?
Yeah.
The only other thing is to er  it's no good.
We've got to do things in the morning.
Yeah.
It opens till nine o'clock any night.
Erm I don't know.
But but if you if you wanted to er come and meet me from work  we could go straight off somewhere then.
Yeah but you see the thing is that if I come and meet you by the time you  no point.
We don't get home till ten to six.
So that if we have to go to Brislington we won't get there until ten to six.
You know what it was like when we went to Tescos.
Be fair  after work .
Yeah but it's open till eight o'clock.
Oh yes it's open till eight.
If they were open till late you could er
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know a lot of places that will be open late.
All the shops in town are open late on one night a week.
Yeah.
But I can't remember what night it is.
I'll phone them up then and see.
I believe   in in town.
What?
Or easier still I'll tell you what.
Hm. mm.
I'm going into Tesco tomorrow
I've got a feeling
If I get back
Yes.
God knows where M F I is in  If I get him to drive me round now I'll remember which way to go.
Mm.
It's not very far off the beaten track
Mm.
I'll have a look round
Yeah
And then we'll have to see if we can sort out something else.
I mean 
Because we'll find it.
On the weekend we've got so much
Yes you've got no time to do it.
Mm.
We don't get a chance.
What we're trying to get the washing and ironing up together and the house work and everything is well you just don't get time to do it.
Hm.
We did have this problem before but we started earlier didn't we?
Last Christmas?
No.
Oh no I we had some time off didn't we?
Yeah we did.
I haven't get any time off I can take now.
I could possibly have a half day next Monday.
Well let me go over and have a look at it and see what they've got.
They may have more than one 
Because this week I'm I'm doing a five day course I tend to add on about an hour to my time  every day.
Yeah.
Cause I tend to do half past eight till half past five with no lunch.
If I do that that's five hours I'll have built up in one week.
Yeah.
So I could take out half a day
Yeah

Mhm.
it'll be while you're settling down rather when it's your er 
Good.
We, we're starting at nine
Yeah.

Well I'm hoping they'll come at half past eight.
In which case  we'll be finished before you get there.

I think it's only three items to be moved out  for you.
Not stuff to be moved in.
Good.
So you've got some 
I got eight.
You got eight?
Yeah

Yeah.
Mm.
So if, if you wanna be wiped off  I can do that.
But if you've no objections?
No, none at all.
That's alright.
It's all in this  thing here.
It's just that er  I'm telling everybody.
Mm.
How did you find out about that?
Ah somebody approached me.
Came to my house and 
Mhm.
when we they found out what sort of  job I did
Mm.
their eyes lit up.
Cos they were trying to fill their quota
Mm.
and they couldn't find anybody living round by me that were employed.
Oh  
So  Certainly not in my age group.
Yeah.
So er 
Oh, brilliant.
So  I get the little  gift voucher .
It just means sort of walking around  recording 
Mm.
It's no problem.
And they give me all the equipment I need.
Yeah.
So er
Mm.
Great.
I, I thought that everybody would  I haven't done it on erm  I was wondering about recording a training session.
Mm.
But then   first day I was with them.
It's the first day I've been with them and I thought  I don't know.
See how it goes.
Mm.
I might  might check them out to see if they would mind if  we did something later on in the week.
Mhm.
They've got to do it till Friday
Mm.
anyway.
Mm.
So   going to be talking to  won't you?. actually it doesn't matter because it's 
they'll think their offices have been bugged.


Oh it's good.
It's quite interesting.
Yeah.
Better show Margaret as well.
Margaret.
Can I just  show you that.
Okay?
Yeah.
Where's this come from?
Well it's erm  something I'm involved in.
And er  something   I switched the erm recorder on just before you walked in to see if it recorded.
What for the whole of the morning?
No  no, no.
Just  just when I was here.
Just a minute ago.
But er if you've any objections I'll wipe it off but
All I can say is that people who hear my voice keep saying  don't you sound like Pam Ayres.


Who comes from a totally place to me.


Yes, one or two.
Yeah.
Erm  Oh I was just trying to remember what, what was said.
Something to do with  Ah Jerry said something quite good about  availability.
Erm  like you can't  although peop people will go for jobs, now produce proof of jobs they've applied for.
You can't tell whether they really want the jobs or not.
Yeah.
And and it is 
So they're actually seeking  then?
Yeah.
Well I suppose not really.
No.
It shows that they've applied for the job.
It doesn't show that they wanted it.
Yeah.
They really tried.
Yeah.
There's no way you  can know that unless you've got the  from the Job Centre that these 
And gives feedback on how they turned up and 
Yeah.
and all this sort of thing.
Yeah.
But er
That's what really makes
something, something very odd came out of that, this Ann  said something I thought  what?
 
And  and the thing is I didn't understand it.
So it's quite difficult to remember exactly what she said.
Mm.
Erm  something to do with  no.
I can't think.
Trouble is when you don't understand it it doesn't sink in.
No that's right.
But everybody sort of.
I remembered  
Have you?
Yeah.
It's a bit like a single office group.
sitting in and we're trying to split them up cos we don't want too  
Yeah.
Which, which they did.
But they've gone back now to sitting altogether.
So.
What's a data type for changing date of birth?
Thanks.
I couldn't, I was asked and I just couldn't think of it.
Yeah  
And there were no guide fives.
No.
Otherwise I'd have said  look it up.
Yeah.
And I didn't have any  Treas keys so I couldn't tell them to use the  help service.
All my options were gone.
Oh, Judy 


asked after you.
How, how you were getting on.
So I said you were getting on okay 
You lied you mean.


Yeah, she's nice, Judy.
Yeah.?
Yes.
She fell about  at one point.
When I said thank you for that.
Evidently she was sta , she was a trainer at one point was she?

Whenever it falls on a Friday it's always a very good birthday.
Erm  I've put these codes in my box.
Yeah.
Being nice.
Yeah.
And sort of not wanting them to go astray.
Yes.
I've now got them on my desk and I don't know where to put them.
Could you politely suggest 
Those three cabinets.
Oh right.
Alright.
So  research  sort of 
Ah.
Huh.
I've lost my bearings now.
I don't know where anything is.
Well I  
I want  the cabinet with all the supplies for the trainees.
For erm  tea, coffee and stuff.
Yeah.
Tea and coffee?
I know it was  was it on the bottom of the A to Z thing?
I wouldn't know.
The A to Z file's in there.
There's a big  Tony.
A to Z files in?
The A to Z files are over there.
Right.
I think that's where it is.
And .
Yeah there's only two lots of cabinets.
One lot over there and one lot there.
Paid the phone bill and the Access.
Oh great.
Okay.
And I'll go and see the building

So I didn't know what .
through the door again the bugger.
That's right.
Ah.
Our dad had a   you know?
Mad, innit?
Oh I haven't got much to do now then.
That's one skirt, two sweatshirts.
And your jeans and that.
I've nearly done, about another quarter of an hour or so.
Mhm.
Okay?
Yeah.
. Make us some tea okay?
Okay.
No the course went alright today.
Good.
Are they a reasonably nice group?
Mm.
They're not, you haven't got any troublemakers?
No.
One or two a bit odd.
A bit odd!
But they're alright.
What do you mean a bit odd?
Erm  there's one girl who's a bit erm
Weird?
Define odd  
Er  She's very  very sure of herself.
Oh one of those.
But she's wrong.
Yeah.
Oh well I'm sure you can knock her into shape.
Oh yeah.
say 
Find it a bit easier now you've done  three as well?
I, I feel more confident, yeah.
Yeah.
I just sort of say  no, er 
Yeah.
. Must turn that radio off.
It's driving me nuts actually.
Yeah.
You can have too much of a good thing.
Or a bad thing as the case may be.
Yeah.
I've been listening to it  for a while.
Mhm.
I've got a  oh I've got a carol practice tomorrow.
Yeah.
So I'm not gonna be able to get to the building society until Wednesday.
Well that's their tough luck.
It's their mistake.
Yeah okay.
So
So long as you feel like that.
I'm not that brokenhearted and I'm, no I'm annoyed.
Does the standing order form say what day of the month it's to be taken out on?
Do you have to fill that in?
On the such and such day of the month innit?
Don't think it does.
Cos I filled it all out and I don't remember having to  if there had been anything like that I'd have asked you about it.
No I'm fed up with them.
This is twice now they've done this to us.
Yeah.
You know.
They
Yeah.
Well I'll go in and see them and sort it out.
But
Only I've got a horrible feeling  if it's 
not until Wednesday 
not done  by now 
It won't be right this month either.
It won't be right this month either, but if that's the case
Yeah.
we can write an extra cheque.
Yeah.
You know?
That's right.
But I'd rather if you didn't mind that you did go in and sort it out cos she said  well put a cheque in the envelope with the standing order form but I mean
No.
That's just  they've already  putting it frankly cocked it up once.
Yeah.
Another opportunity for them to do it again.
That's right.
What cheque!
Yeah.
I didn't see a cheque!
There wasn't a ch , just a standing order form, that's all we got.
You know?
Yeah.
Cheque number blah blah blah  written on
Yeah.
It doesn't make any difference, it's just  you know  hassle.
Yeah.
This skirt is horrible.
I was keeping it for cleaning the car.
And I'm having to resort to
Oh.
some paint splashes .
I'm looking forward to our tour round the chocolate factory next Wednesday.
Yeah it'll be nice.
Be interesting.
Next Wednesday?
Yeah.
Erm 
Right.
We'll go out and see Auntie Bettie before then.
So
Mm.
I'm not in class next Wednesday.
Oh great.
The only fly in the ointment is if it starts at seven, it's going to be a bit of a rush.
Cos you don't usually get home until ten to six.
No.
And after all the fuss that's been going on in work I don't really like to ask to go early.
No.
If you see what I mean.
Mhm.
But.
I got two Helens in the group.
Oh that's nice.
Helen, yes yes .
Luckily they've sat themselves on opposite sides of the room.
Oh that's good.
So you look at one.
Yeah.
So I can look at one and say Helen?
When they sit together you've got problems.
Yeah!
Fine.
Er.
Mum!
Hello.
Can you do my coat for me.
Pardon?
Take everything out the pockets and then
Okay
do the buttons and the zip up.
Will you?
Yeah.
Better bring my book up to date.
I've 
See what I mean about that skirt?
Yeah.
It's horrible.
Is that beer alright that I bought for you?
Yeah.
Yeah I  I had a vague recollection of you drinking Newcastle Brown sometime and quite liking it.
You certainly did.
And I know you quite liked this didn't you?
Yes  I did.
So
It's quite strong, but
Well.
Well it says strong lager, that's why I bought it.
Yeah.
Stop saying yeah  in that tone of voice.
I found in the bottom  can I talk to you while you're doing that or?
Yeah.
I found in the bottom of the freezer  some pork  that I didn't know we had.
Yeah.
Pork loin steak and 
Mhm 
two packets of chicken breasts that I didn't know we had.
So in having a clear out I
Oh good.
It was quite good  today.
But I've thrown a few things out, as well.
That were  in the freezer and they'd obviously been in there for a bit too long.
Yeah.
So a couple of bits have gone.
Mhm.
Oh that was a disappointment, there's another sweatshirt lurking under there that I didn't see.
Oh.
Ooh.
Gonna have a cup of tea in a minute?
Yeah.
Whenever it's ready actually cos my back's aching so
Okay.
Well it's made.
I've only gotta
Well if you go up to 
pour it out.
I'll finish this last sweatshirt and then I'll
Okay.
have a sit and a cup of tea.
see in a minute something's gonna go in that I swear it is.


I've narrowly missed it about three times already.
Now the problem with them doing a course the worst  the worst bit is erm   the Wednesday.
Yeah.
You're not halfway through.
Well, sometime Wednesday you go, you really go through it cos you  you're not  you're not halfway through but you're still  but you've done quite a bit.
Yeah.
It was Wednesday night last time I did this course I felt really whacked.
Yeah.
And you're gonna feel it this time as well because  having that cold.
Yeah.
Think erm  I'm getting er  oh  getting better.
Things don't throw me as much now.
No.
Well it will I mean
Found out one, one of them used to be a staff trainer.
Used to be?
Yeah.
Well used to be's don't count.
Well I actually said thank you for that and she dissolved into fits of laughter.
Why did she tell you that?
So I I've got to avoid  no that's  I wondered.
And she told me then, after that, why she'd laughed.
No.
Explain it again.
You've lost me somewhere.
I said  thankyou for that  at the end of an exercise.
Yeah.
And she said  and she di dissolved into fits of laughter.
And I won , and  I didn't know why.
Thanks.
Have you poured out one for Christine ?
Yeah.
Can you bring hers in, or she's gonna create hell   biscuits .
She's had bran flakes.
She  .
Mm.
And er  so I said  she dissolved into fits of laughter so  after that she explained it by saying well I used to be a trainer and I know how  I got to avoid the stock phrases.
You alright?
Christine, there aren't enough biscuits for us to have one each.
You can have a Snack if you want but if you do you won't have one for school tomorrow.
You've had two bowls of cereal, you're not starving are you?
There's some chocolate chip cookies out there if you want some.
I'm gonna have    there are some crumbs in those packets but they're impossible to get out.
Oh well.
Crumbs don't count.
Don't worry about that.
No.
They'll be  will they just get washed out?
They'll get washed out, yeah.
Erm  do the zip up and tie a bow in those strings.
Life-sense
Oh ow!
What've you done?
Ow!
Ow 
What've you done?
Let me see.


Christine let me see, what have you done?
There's nothing there.
What did you do?
Bend your nail back?
Yeah.
I I could have sworn that they came off my skin.
Feels like it but it's just where it bends back and it pulls it out straight.
That's why it's  horrible.
Do you mind eating a bit later on?
No.
I've st still got this sort of   this sort of
Are there any Rice Crispies mum?
Oh aren't there any out there?
Oh that's it then.
I still got this little housewife feeling that it ought to be ready when you come in the door you know   .
Well  there's a couple of hours of good telly on tonight.
Good.
There's erm 
Will I be able to move the car up  outside the house a bit later on?

It's good that.
Mm.
It's alright.
Christine.
Do you trust my judgement about your desk?
So if I were to go out tomorrow and see one and it was nice
Mm.
and I got it, would that suit you?
Mm.
Depends if I could have it still tomorrow or not.
Well you can't have it until your bedroom's sorted out and  
Yeah but once my bedroom's sorted out.
Well you've been told you can have your desk and your chair, but you're not gonna have your lamp and  erm  some other bits.

It's not that he's being kicked out.
My pencil case is breaking.
I know.
It's only the lining though.
I really liked that  that one.
And that one's great.
I'll see this little bit then I'll go and finish that ironing and  would you record er Watchdog for me?
Yeah.
On car safety 
Do you wanna make a cup of tea?
If we're eating later 
Yeah.
Have we got any crisps?
not a lot in there.
I was gonna get some more tomorrow.
When am I gonna have my tea?
Erm
I can get your tea in a minute.
No no I don't mind.
Ha ha  I just  she just said to me you any good at German .
I looked at it an I said that's French.
And she said I know but are you any good at German.
Sorry.
I'll erm  get some kitchen roll.
Put tissue over it.
Mm.
What's this gonna sound like on that tape.
I know what I'm getting .
I know what I'm getting .
no look.
Don't break them.
No.
Oh don't do that.
Right.
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
You choose.
Ooh.
Alright?
Ah.
Is she a shepherd or just an old crook?
Can I have a crisp
Oh dear.
I must admit I like to see that, because  so many people, if a dog had to lose a leg they'd say put it to sleep, put it to sleep.
Mm.
Yeah 
And  why?
If you lost a leg they'd stick a false one on you or give you a set of wheels.
Mm.
Right.
So why kill it why kill a dog because it's gonna lose a leg.
Mm.
It's got  well you've only got two.
You lose yours, one of yours and it's a disaster.
Mm.
If a dog loses one, well it's still got three to get on with, you know?
Yeah.
It's hardly a handicap at all to a dog.
It's happened to one dog and he learned to walk like a human  
Mm.
He walked like a human.
. And he spun right round and he  like that.
And they said get up.
And he rolls over and then he sort of put his legs up.
I can't remember  no he sort of I can't do it.
But to lose a leg for a dog is hardly a handicap at all.
Mm.
Cos they've got three others.
They just lose their balance occasionally.
Well that's why a dog that limps slightly  very often there's practically nothing wrong with it.
Yeah.
If it thinks it's gonna hurt it will limp.
Yeah 
 
Whereas people, if you've got a painful leg you've got to walk on it.
Whereas a dog might have a slightly painful leg and it will limp like hell.
Mm.
Yeah.
Cos it doesn't have to use it.
Oh no we've got some really hard numbers    french if I had a dictionary I could look it up but I haven't.
Right.
Who can claim income support?
Er  to be over eighteen is it?
Erm  some people under eighteen can claim.
Who are the main  area of people that we deal with?
A generalization for most of the people we see coming in?
Most people.
Unemployed.
Unemployed.
Unemployed.
Yeah.
So people who are unemployed  can claim income support.
Any other people apart from people who are unemployed that can claim income support?
Those on low incomes?
Low income, yes.
Anyone else?
Training courses.
Training courses.
You know?
Like U T and
Right.
They're actually paid a training allowance, which is related to income support.
But it isn't their income support.
Mm.
So anything  anyone else who might receive  income support?
Old age pensioners.
Pensioners.
Yes.
Anyone else?
If you're disabled?
Erm  yes but they normally receive their erm
Disability allowance.
their own benefits.
Yes related to disability.
But yes they can if they don't receive enough from other means.
Yeah.


Yes.
It's what the government 
Think I heard that one   That's quite an old one 


There's
No it's alright.
There's erm  there's one other erm  group of people that might be able to claim
 
One parent families.
 
Yeah.
Single parents.
That's another very common one.
Yep.
Single parents.
Right.
So what factors decide what you get under income, income support?
Your income I suppose.?
Erm 
means tested.
Yeah, yeah.
So looking at somebody's needs  and what are the sort of things they're likely to take into account?
Yeah 
How many there are in the family.
Income.
Er  how many in the family?
Yes.
Number of dep 
Number of children.
Number of children.
Is that opposed to the number of adults 
Erm
as well as.
As well as.
Financial commitments.
Financial commitments.
Mortgage  
Housing 
Yes.
Mortgage will  They will help with the mortgage.
What happens about rent?
Get some housing benefit.
Yeah.
They can claim housing benefit.
That isn't income support, that's another benefit that they claim from the Local Authority.
So if they're in rented accommodation then they will need to make a claim to a Local Authority for that.
What other things might D S S take into account?
Poll tax.
Savings.
Er  savings.
You mentioned poll tax.
Erm another, another thing you can claim is relief from paying poll tax.
So it's not directly linked with income support.
You claim relief from the people who collect poll tax.
But the fact you are claiming income support is a factor that they look at.
So if you were  in receipt of income support then you don't have to pay very much.
So who are these people then that you  get relief from if you want help with your poll tax?
Right.
You would claim that from your Local Authority.
In the same way as housing benefit.
You've got housing benefit forms 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay?
Savings.
Erm  something else that would relate to number of children, adults is also the age.
The ages of the people in the house.
What, just of the children, or of the adults as well?
Well  once they're over eighteen age is immaterial.
Oh.
Right.
But erm there, there are a couple of different rates at which er income support is claimed depending on how old the child is.
Oh really?
Yeah.
What about the other er end of the scale?
Somebody over sixty five or seventy five or eighty  
Right.
As I understand it there's no no banding at that end.
That's strange isn't it?
Because there's a lot of erm pensions that are triggered off by the age of the elderly person.
Mm.
Of course there, there are things, I mean there is the pension.
There is also attendance allowance and there are various things like that which are  outside this.
Mm.
Yeah.
But they will take into account any special help that is needed for somebody who's disabled.
Washing.
Extra, extra money for wa if they've got lots of washing to do.
So you can get special help if somebody's disabled.
Oh you're right.
There's a pension  as well.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
That's alright.
Right.
So.
Let's have a look  has any , has anyone not seen erm B one?
No I haven't.
I'm not really 
Right.
Well  I've only seen the back of it.
I've never looked right through it.


So how, how many do we need?
All, all 
You have a look between the two 
You've been reading B one's all week.
Have I?
You've been reading B one's for weeks haven't you?
Right.
Your rate of allowances aren't there because they go out of date so fast so I've got an extra, you can have one of these each  with the rate of allowances.
Thanks.
And there's also  you may or may not have  the erm form which you claim relief for community charge and housing benefit  inside the form.
You have to have another one if you're in cou , if you're not in council accommodation from the l which we issue as well.


.
You get so much stuff from the N C A's who do that.
The N C A's who do 
Right.
So  can I wipe this side off.
Ooh.
That's not fair is it?
If you're eighteen to twenty four years old and you're bringing up a child on your own.
You get the same as twenty five years and older.
Right.
So if we look at a  a typical family.
We have  wife and husband both over eighteen.
Both over eighteen.
How much would they get?
Sixty two twenty five?
That's it.
Sixty two pounds twenty five.
Okay?
Now if they had a child who's four years old, how much would they get?
Thirteen thirty five.
Thirteen thirty five.
For each child.
Okay?
And then another child who is  sixteen.
Right.
That's right.
So.
What about if they're fourteen?
Nineteen seventy five.
Nineteen seventy five.
There you go.
And in addition to that there is a premium because they are a family.
And the premium because they have at least one child is seven pounds ninety nine, ninety five.
So ev even if you had six children, you'd still allowed, still only get seven ninety five?
That's right.
In addition to the 
Yeah
Yeah, yeah.
Okay?
I doubt if you'd have six children under four would you?
You could have I suppose  
Oh well  .
Going back to what Jerry said you'd 
So.
You've got a total income coming in, er a total amount of benefit there of a hundred and three pounds thirty  for this family.
Okay?
Now  they will also be entitled to child benefit.
Okay?
So child benefit  for two children it's ninety twenty five for the first.
Seven twenty five for the second.
So that sixteen pounds fifty.
 
What are those rates again?
Nine twenty five first, and seven  twenty five  
It's not 
Ah.
Sneaky peaky eh?
So the, for the oldest child it's nine pounds twenty five.
Sorry it's not on there.
No  
What is it?
Ten pounds twenty five?
Nine twenty five for the first child.
And then seven pounds twenty five for  subsequent children.
Making sixteen pounds fifty in total.
This would then be treated as income by D S S and so this amount would be reduced by sixteen pounds fifty.
That's a con innit?
Mm.
I make that eighty six eighty?
Yeah?
Mm.
Now that's an idea to how they do it.
Don't try to counsel somebody and tell them how much income support they're going to get.
Because that's very very basic.
There are lots and lots of other things the D S S can take into account.
Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau.
Yeah.
Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau or the D S S.
I feel sorry for the D S S cos the Citizen's Advice Bureau  to make sure that the people get all they're entitled to 
Mm
The Citizen's Advice Bureau has got a pro forma which if a person goes in and says  I think I ought to be getting, I think I, I don't think I'm getting sufficient income support or I'm going to apply for income support.
What should I get?
And they go through and tell them what they should get.
Mm?
Which I would find very trying if I was in the D S S quite honestly.
Yeah.
Right.
Now  so having issued B one, where's it got to go?
The D S S.
Right.
So it goes to the D S S.
Which one?
The one nearest .
The one in the area which in they live.
So it it's not specifically related to the benefit office where they're signing.
It's based on where they live.
And so you might find that some offices have to think of two or three  D S S offices and refer various people to the, to various ones.
Depending on where they live.
Okay?
Now when you had that bundle of handouts that are all stapled together  
 
There was  a list of the D S S offices  together with guidance on their address.
Now if I can check that you've all got that.
I you haven't, I've got a list here that I can let you have.
It looks like that.
and then if you come across it later.
I was just wondering that.
Or is it  it is in fact North Radstock isn't it?
. The actual town is North Radstock.
Okay.
Any question so far?
Okay?
Right so when do you issue a B one?
At fresh claims.
Change of circumstances.
Fresh claims.
Fresh claims.
Er what do you mean by change of circumstances?
If they change their address or something or they live with somebody else or they  move out from somewhere 
Yeah.
Erm  change of  let's say person's circumstances.
It might be limiting with a change of address it might not.
Yeah?
Any 
Also when they run out of U B.
When they run out of U B.
Yes.
Any other times when you might issue one?
Erm  situation where you have somebody  who has left their job.
Wasn't clear at the time what the circumstances were.
You may find when you have the reply back from the employer that you have to suspend unemployment benefit.
In that instance you could issue a B one so that he would have some money coming in.
So  if unemployment benefit is suspended  and erm another circumstance which might arise is somebody  expects to receive unemployment benefit and then finds that they're not entitled to it.
Because of contribution problems.
If in doubt
Yes.
always give a B one in my opinion.
Yes.
That's right.
They may  the only thing is they may not wish to take one.
You don't have to, you don't have to claim.
And they may say no no I don't want to claim.
In which case that's fair enough.
But at some future time they may decide they want to.
If a person refuses U B.
They should take  you should issue them with a leaflet 
Sorry?
Refuses U B?
Issues  refuses I S
Mhm
You should issue them with the basic leaflet telling them about I S.
Mhm.
So that they're aware of what they've refused.
That's a very good  er very good precaution to take, yes.
Very good idea.
I don't normally.
But  you can do .
Well yes you can but  if anyone refuses U B er I S rather I always give them a leaflet.
so that you are sure I'm not conning you.
So before we issue  before we hand over the B one what do we do?
Fill in the back.
We fill in the back.
Yes?
.We'll be giving you some exercises later about filling in the back.
Erm
Who would do this then.
I mean it wouldn't just be  anyone could do this, fill out the back it doesn't have to be an E O does it?
No, no it doesn't have to be an E O.
Right.
Erm the only thing is  what does happen occasionally is somebody comes from the D S S offices and they've been told, I need a B one.
What they haven't been told is that you actually have to make a claim for benefit.
And have to sign on every fortnight.
every day .
It happens every day.
Every day.
And  yes.
And, and so then they, they're a bit miffed that instead of the B one they're being asked to complete a U B four six one, a U B six seven one.
They then have to come to an appointment and be interviewed.
Whereas in actual fact I don't want all this, I want is a B one.
But they have to make a claim before you can issue a B one.
And the D S S can't issue B ones unless they've gone through all the procedure.
That's right.
In fact D S S don't issue B ones.
We, we have to issue B ones.
Because they have new people on the counter and it's it's 
 
Good question.
It happens every single day .
Go down and get a B one 
How long does it take for income support to come through?
Once a claim has been made.
According to the managers five and a half days in this area.
How long is a piece of string?
Five and a half days?
They can get it immediately.
get it immediately 
That's what I was quoted last week.
Right.
When I asked the self-same question.
He said five and a half days.
He hasn't .
The last time 
I, I would I would have thought it could have, could take, it could easily take ten days.
Yeah Two weeks.
Two weeks.
When they had problems not so long ago it was taking a month.
Yeah.
I heard it was six weeks.
A month, six weeks.
Well they have targets like we all have and one of their targets is how quickly they can turn around the claimant's money.
Mm.
What does a  claimant do then they've got no money then for six weeks if it takes six weeks.
Come and bang on our door for six weeks.
They get, I think they can 
Yeah
They can get a crisis loan.
They don't, they can also get paid early direct by the D S S.
D S S will actually pay them rather than telling us to pay them.
But is it up to them to actually go to D S S and say I want a payment now?
 
That's right.
So if you get someone in that situation who's saying I'm desperate for money, I'm claiming income support, I've heard nothing  and you haven't been told how much they're entitled to.
Then they can actually go to the D S S office and say that they need some money urgently and D S S may make a payment.
But may but not nec 
May 
May not.
Yeah.
It depends on the circumstances and you're not, you're not in a position to say  what D S S will or won't do.
So you can only say they may make a payment.
under er  I think they would do under most circumstances.
It would only be if they suspected that something  odd was going on.
Okay and how do D S S tell us how much to pay  income support?
B two.
Yep.
B two.
Right.
Before I ask you to complete B one there's one more thing we need to talk about.
And that is about what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord.
So what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord, what happens to their unemployment benefit.
Suspended.
Suspended pending enquiries.
Yeah.
But not, it's suspended, it's suspended but it's not disallowed.
That's right.
So what, what's the difference?
Well it's suspended pending enquiries so it's in suspension.
They, we're looking into the reasons.
And if erm  they don't like the outcome of our deliberations they have a right of appeal.
Right.
But when, when the adjudication officer has made a decision  he will then allow or disallow.
So that that's the  so at first the claim is suspended.
And then when you have a decision from the adjudication officer it is then allowed or disallowed.
And then they can appeal.
And then they can appeal.
If they wish.
Yeah.
It used to be six months didn't it, and now it's gone up to 
That's right, yes.
Big jump isn't it?
Well.
It went up in stages.
Oh did it?
It went to thirteen weeks and then it went to twenty six weeks.
Did it?
Yeah.
As a deterrent.
Which it never has had any effect on  at all.
That was the reason behind it.
It was a, a deterrent to people giving up their jobs but nobody knew about it.
People don't know about it now.
So if they immediately fall back on IS, I mean it
Yeah that's just what I was going to say.
What happens then, to income support?
Paid at a reduced rate.
It's paid at a reduced rate  for the period of the suspension.
I thought if it's disqualifying, if you were disqualified then  income support pays normal 
No.
Sorry it's, it's, if it's allowed they would have a reason  income support to pay.
If it's disallowed  then erm they would have their entitlement in that they would be paid a reduced rate during the period of the susp , er of the disallowance.
And would they still get the income support after that but still at a reduced rate or not?
Right.
Once we're out of the twenty six week period it would go back to its normal rate.
I think we're talking about  once the suspension was over
Yeah
and the adj the A O has made the decision.
disallowed
Mhm.
they'd carry on getting the reduced rate prior to the period of disallowance.
That's right yes.
They'd still get paid then?
Yes, but at a reduced   reduced rate.
What is the reduced rate.
I'm sorry.
I'll go on to talk about that .
Is there a handout on this because
Right.
I've got a handout on the reduced rate, yes.
And I'm gonna be giving you a handout which gives you information about how to calculate it.
I never tell people getting a reduced rate 
Well no because they just go bananas if you do.
You've got to be careful.
What, what do we call that  reduction, deduction?
U D
Right.
Yep.
I don't know if you've heard that term at all around.
What does it stand for?
The  deduction.
Yep.
oh.
Let's try that again.
Unemployed  deduction.
Okay?
Details of any reductions that have been made are held in enquiry screen four.
The reduction is made on the personal rate available.
So in this instance it would be made on half, if, if the husband had left his job of his own accord  it would be made on half of that amount.
Surely that's  for his wife as well so she 
No 
No no no.
No that's why it would only be  it would be made  your deduction would be made on half of that amount.
 
Oh I see.
No, no.
The deduction is based on
The deduction isn't half that amount
No.
it's made on half that amount.
It's, yeah.
And it is forty percent of that.
Made on the 
So
So can you give us  on that.
Yes.
You've got
I'm just trying to  
The man's would be sixteen erm
Thirty one 
thirty one pounds whatever on the twelve.
thirty p.
Yeah.
So it, it's forty percent of thirty two pounds.
Yes?
Yep.
That's right.
Reduction then on the personal  sorry, can you repeat what you said about  the reduction is made, made on the personal 
 
Yes.
It's made on the amount that that person, that individual is receiving in income support.
It's not on the whole family.
family should be penalized.
Yeah.
Just the the individual  and that one portion of the income support is reduced by forty percent.
So  what's forty percent of thirty one pound twenty five.
Erm  erm 
Yeah.
It's about twelve pounds a week.
What happens if you, if you're not on that rate 
What if you're a single person only getting thirty nine something?
Then you  doesn't need much does he.
But do you get the reduced rate, is it reduced forty percent for all sort of categories whether you're married, single?
Yes, yes.
I thought there were exceptions if the person was pregnant or something.
If there's a pregnant person in the house.
Yes.
There are exceptions.
So that the  majority of people will be subject to a  forty percent deduction  on their personal benefit  and their personal rate.
Okay?
That's irrespective whether they're married or single?
That's right.
Erm  the deduction will only made, be made  if a suspension is held on our computer.
So if somebody forgets to put the suspension on


It's not actually cos it causes real problems .
In other words it can take  doing that person no good service  like if there's any doubt  suspending it immediately.
They can always get the arrears.
And they get very uptight if they get erm  too much and then it's reduced rather than the other way round.
Mm.
Can I  ask ?
Yeah.
queries at the end.
No.
No that's fine.
I'm still a bit confused about erm  sorry I should have brought this up at the time.
It's alright.
Claims suspended for twenty six weeks by our good selves
Yes.
therefore if they apply for income support
Mhm
that is also reduced by forty percent.
Yeah.
Right.
What if they're unemployment benefit was disqualified?
The adjudication officer, we suspend it, the adjudication officer says  right, they're not supposed to have it.
What happens to their income support, do they still continue to receive it at a reduced rate?
That's right.
For the period of the disallowance.
And it would then revert back to full rate.
And the disallowance can be
Up to twenty six weeks.
Yeah.
thank you.
Okay?
Right.
Erm  the  some people can actually have a reduction made of twenty percent instead.
If, in this family the wife was expecting a baby  then  then it would be a twenty percent deduction.
Also if one or other of the partners, well it would have to be the partner that wasn't signing  was seriously ill  then the reduct deduction would be twenty percent.
Providing  there's a condition attached, that they have savings of less than two hundred pounds.
What if the claimant should become seriously ill?
sick.
Sick 
Do they get a reduced rate  on the sickness benefit?
No
No  They get more on sickness benefit than they do on 
And another thing  if you're living with somebody  and, and you're both unemployed.
If the person that's got the sack doesn't make the claim but the other person claims then it doesn't affect them either.
If you see what I mean.
Oh I see  so er  you're assuming then that the person that was claiming  isn't working?
Wasn't, wasn't.
Isn't working but hasn't had the sack.
Perhaps they've been made redundant.
Perhaps their partner's had the sack.
If the  person  that has had, been made redundant to make the claim, can claim for the other person and there's no red 
dependent, yeah.
Yeah so there's no reduction on that.
 

suspension  for three hundred and twelve days.
very often find knowing that they've left voluntarily to have babies and have decided not to go back to the job although the job's been kept open for them.
They're disallowed for six months and then coming and 
Right.
I hope this doesn't cause you a problem, but the rates of benefit have changed  very slightly since the first of October ninety one.
And the handout I've got here which I couldn't tie in just now when I was trying to do the deduction is because the rates are very slightly different.
It's about thirty pence or so more.
Than actually what we were talking about.
So I'm sorry about that.
I'll get the other one updated.
Erm but what you've got now  if you, can I pass those round and I'll explain what that says.
Is this one the same as we've got in that erm wad again?
Oh you had one in the wad did you?
Yes I had one, yeah  else did but I
In the one that we shouldn't have had which we did have.
Oh it's been a good week.
Right.
If you'd have a look at that.
The appendix age twenty  the  category which you can see there, nought to four.
That tells you the amount of income support which the deduc er for which the deduction is appropriate.
Hang on a minute.
Are we looking at 
No, we're looking at page two, yeah.
Right.
 
I've got April ninety one here.
Right  some are April, some of October and they're all mixed up.
I'm April
Wonderful.
I'm October.
Okay, October  you want, you want, anyone else need  October  
Yes please  
And if you please destroy the other one.
Yeah, that's the latest one.
Right  Okay have a look at that.
The B U category  nought to four.
That shows the amount  of weekly rate to which the  can be applied.
So that shows how much we're gonna apply our deduction to.
Okay?
And we can see the rates for which the deduction is going to be applied  the other side.
So erm a single under eighteen or couple both under eighteen twenty three pound ninety.
That re , that should relate to the allowances you had before.
And that's  so that's twelve fifty five if it's 
So if a forty percent deduction is made on category two, then somebody receiving thirty one pounds forty a week  would actually, it would actually be reduced by twelve pounds fifty five.
Do you see how that works?
Mm.
No sorry.
I've lose where that twelve fifty five comes from.
Right.
If you look at category two.
What here?
Yeah.
Yeah right.
They're in receipt of thirty one pounds forty?
Yeah.
So if you look at category two down below.
Forty percent deduction applied for a full week.
Twelve pound fifty five.
Oh right, twelve fifty five yeah.
Mhm.
Yeah okay.
Okay?
So the B U category shows the amount of income support that er is being, that the deduction is being based on.
And then the B U indicator  indicates whether it's rate one or rate two and indicates whether it's a twenty percent or forty percent deduction.
Now right at the beginning of a claim you can have an odd number of days before the first benefit week ending day.
There will also be an indicator on the B two to say how those days should be treated.
There will be a number which will be the number, should be the number of days before the benefit week ending day in the first week of the claim.
Right.
Any questions on that?
Well only one and that is
Mhm?
you've given us this information.
Right.
But  don't tell them  what they're likely to receive.
Yes.
So the information that is given us is for our information only, or?
Right.
You can go so far as to say that  I mean, you will be safe in saying that if your, that as your benefit is suspended  your income support for you, not for your family but for you, will be reduced.
It will probably be reduced by forty percent.
.. Yeah?
Yeah.
But if you, if you look at a B two  it makes sense, I mean I've looked at B two's and I haven't really understood what the one's two's and three's are for but now it makes sense to me so people who are  B two  makes more sense to them to know what 
 
Yeah.
We'll be having a look at some B two's and we'll pick up this bit about  and er the coding when you have a look at that.
It's knowing how much information you can supply and how much you keep out isn't it?
Yes.
Yes that's right.
You know.
Cos what we give to the client 
Okay?
Right.
So  I've now got a handout for you  and it'll be up to date about how to complete a B one.
Yeah, anybody else want to stretch their legs a second?
No, Okay?
 

handouts.
Some of them are quite hard to read.
Yes this, this one, this new one  ought to get it retyped.
It's quite an important one really.
Mm, yeah.
I'm using it all the time.
I've got better copies of the blank B one, but the handout is getting rather  Right so if we're looking at, we'll complete the B one.
Note the reverse of the U B A T B that we're issuing  and pass it to the client with an envelope to send to the right D S S office.
Sorry which is the A T B?
I can't remember, is it?
That's, that's the one er the shopping list.
Oh the shopping list, yeah.
I hate to tell you the D S S are on an economy campaign and they no longer issue envelopes.
They no longer issue envelopes.
At least they don't in Bath and you have to write the address on the front.
Oh they don't  
They don't do here either.
And then if it's in another area  which invariably is if you've got to give them  somewhere like Trowbridge or sometimes erm  in Bath or Chippenham You then have to ring up D S S to find the address.
Well hopefully all this will give you the address although it depends how far away it is.  contact D S S to get the address.
Actually it's stupid that business about the envelopes.
Mm.
quite sure which one.
It's slightly higher than the other.
Well it just sort of right.
It's just like that.
No it's not, no it's not.
Tiny little bit.
Yeah.
I  I think mine are more out than yours actually.
Yeah cos 
Yeah.
But mine are, I think mine are more out than yours but  they're not level.
And that's  those dimples are the bottom  are on the bottom bit of your spine so  if the dimples aren't level it means that bit of your back is slightly
Yeah and you gotta have something wrong with your back.
No.
you get that, can't you?
No.
Did I have that when I was ?
That doesn't matter.
Daddy's legs needn't be the same length.
Men's legs needn't be the same length.
 

In fact very few people's legs are exactly the same length.

I ordered a skirt this morning as well.

Yeah Well, we tried.
Why is it lately that I go to, before I start my  my work
Mhm?
I feel absolutely done in.
You know I've worked so much at home
Mm.
that I feel so tired.
So I think this is half the reason why  I'm not  that .
Mm.
Because by the time I get to work
Mm.
Yeah.
You know?


You get there and there's, there's not that much pressure so you tend to sort of think  ah.
And you go at the speed that it warrants.
Mm.
If there's a lot to do you go quicker and if there's not you go slower.
Mm.
One of the gir er one of the women on the course  is er  she's, she said is the introduction course on, week after next st 
Introduction?

But  then she couldn't very well say, oh no, could she?
No.
Oh what you again!

And that book upstairs.
I don't want to read it, I'm not interested.
No.
But what can you say to her?
Say, mm yeah.
Yeah but then she'll start asking me things about it and I won't know.
Ah.
I'll just say, look Julie I haven't had time to read it
No.
so you might as well have it all back.
And don't give it to me again.
Only  she will say  well hang on to it till you've listened to it.
I'm in no hurry.
That's the problem.
Yeah.
And
Well fine.
In that case I'll hang on to it but I really think she ought to, actually I'll I'll take round there when I'm home.
Either that  or
Wrap it up and drop it through the letter box.
No!
No you can wait until you can see her going out with  wait until the car's not there if you know what car she's driving these days.
Oh dear.
And then you drop it in on Iris when she's looking after
Well Iris is there Wednesdays and Fridays.
Mum ,
Alright .
So you can drop it in on a Wednesday  drop it in 
On Iris.
On Iris and say 
I haven't seen Julie actually about the kid's Christmas presents.
And not getting stuff for each other so I hope she hasn't been out and done it all.
Mm.
Ooh   
That programme's on  in about five minutes about food?
Oh yeah.
And we've got quite a bit well  either that or we could watch the programme and then wash up, clear up and go to bed.
Couldn't we?
I haven't had time to do any shopping today or anything.
So we  we'll have a cup of tea in a minute.
We'll ge , see Christine in bed.

Do you leave this door open?
Yeah.
and I fumbling for my key.
You were fumbling were you?

Fumble, fumble, fumble.
It amazes me how early they are people are putting up their Christmas decorations.
It's only three weeks, innit?
Yeah but no I mean  Caroline down there have had lights up for about six weeks.
Oh good god  a bit too early.
Erm  I mean most people in your flat it's still three weeks away  we tend to put ours up about a week early, just over a week before Christmas.
That we do.
No it gets a bit ridiculous when it's  a week before and then until January the sixth.
Yeah.
That's what we tend to do isn't it?
Mhm   
It always looks  
 
like that,
I wish they'd stop going on about Christmas for heaven's sake,.


I I'm trying not to think about  way I feel on Christmas morning cos 
her birthday  because of Christmas
Oh I see.
she gets so this is your Christmas present and your birthday present
And that's all wrong.
all in one  and I think that's horrible   Did you see that car 
They got a bi they got tinsel around the aerial 
Just put  yeah  tinsel wound around 
Oh no.
the aerial and he's trailing some in the back window as well.
Ha ha.
How stupid can people get!
Well  you sa 
I don't know that.
you say that but if we had a cigarette lighter in  in this car, a socket  an electrical socket I'd 
You'd have a little tree with flashing lights.
No.
Looks like you can't get out.
Oh look at that one they got arrows  an they got two arrows facing one another.
Yeah  Rightio Jackie  I'll see you all tomorrow night.
Okay then.
Bye.
Bye.
Cheerio Christine.
Okay?
Yeah I'm alright  ah.
Chilly isn't it?
.
Oh it's pedestrians I can read the sign from back there.
Mm.
it looks.
I suppose.
no there's already a pavement there.
I don't know.
Mm.
better pavement?
Possibly.
Widening the road?
Maybe  or putting in erm  that cable   cos they've dug a trench around it.
Yeah.
Putting a barbed wire fence round the  stop the   I don't know .
Yeah.
Can you turn it up again Daddy?
I still can't here it.
Well I can  and I don't wanna be deafened by it.
This man's up here selling his Christmas trees again, he's a real menace this chap.
Mhm.
No  it gets blocked though doesn't it?
Yeah  it's on a weekend when everybody comes out here to buy their trees and they're parking they're cars on the roundabout
Yeah.
mm  it gets a bit much though.
I'm glad we don't go for that  sort of tree actually.
No  I was looking at trees in er  B and Q
Yeah.
I'm not suggesting anything don't say it in that tone of voice!
It's alright no I didn't mean t .
and they had  do you know how much er a really nice  sort of six foot seven foot tree is?
No.
An artificial one from B and Q seventy nine pounds was a seven foot one 
Good grief!
sixty nine pounds was a six foot one.
Oh.
Mind they were lovely trees
Mm.
they were sort of blue spruce type, do you know what I mean?
Yeah  but
But you think ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Good grief!
I know what I'm gonna do for practical .
Oh Christine!
You made me jump then.
Yeah so did I .
I know exactly what I'm gonna do for practical .
What are you gonna do?
Exactly!
I'm gonna make this little shape of a snowman  and then I sew s sequins on it.
Oh yes that would be lovely.
She showed us one, she had a Christmas tree  and she had er  star  and tha that was the same kind of thing it's sort of 
Mm.
stuffed and then it had sequins sewn and that.
Oh that would be nice, Christine.
It'll be lovely   do that.
Sounds really nice.
Yes.
Mm.
But you've got to pay a little of money.
Well that doesn't matter.
Because
It's alright.
She said all the fabrics and sequins are fairly expensive.
They are.
Yeah.
So if you wanna take them home you've got to pay a little bit of money
Well that's alright we'll 
That's alright.
it's only about twenty  twenty, thirty, forty pee something like that.
Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a pound  yeah I know .


No  the highest she said is about fifty pee.
Alright.
It's not much  and that's 
And that's e 
the highest   
Well that's not high.
I wonder what's happening here?
Well what's happening here is all the cars are stopped and there all  one behind the other


sorry  I  .
I'll get my own back on you!
Oh.
Oh  ha.
Oh no  somebody's in trouble.
There's been an h accident.
No there's been an accident Christine.
That's what it er  seems like  erm if there's a police car  you can bet your life  the chances are  there's gonna be another one or an ambulance  if there's been an accident.
Yeah.
This cars turned round even to go out the bottom of   there's been an accident  oh.
Mum?
Mummy?
Just take it out of gear  please  yeah?
There are pe some people are going down erm  Shallard's Road.
Probably a good idea  actually well done  if er we get the chance we'll er  do the same 
Mm.
go down  Shallard's Road and then we can go down er  where is it?
Oh it's up there  where is no that's the police  yeah the police cars parked down there
So if you went along  Shallard's Road
and came out of Long Beach we'll miss it 
Came out of Long Beach Road we'll miss it.
Yeah  so 
Or you could go down California Road
Well that's what I  that's what I mean go down  down  Shallard's Road here down 
Yeah 
from California Road
and along Long Beach 
and along the Long Beach Road
or you could carry on along California Road
I don't wanna go 
you 
past that  if it is an accident I don't wanna go past it.
If you went on down  California Road  and went down into  Oldland 
by Christine's school
Oh no I'm not going all around that way.
then you could come off the roundabout from  Kachenend 
avoiding the strategy.
I hope that's not what I think it is.
It's probably a road accident Christine.
Someone's been knocked down.
Did you see?
Awful lot of people standing about.
Yeah well that's because people are ghoulish  some people will stand in the road and stare.
Mummy, there was shopping bags and bags and things upset on the floor.
Oh.
In the road.
Might not be it might be equipment out of the ambulance or something you don't know.
Mum in each of these groups  in erm  today  I know exactly what they're doing  what we did before was cookery  this month's sewing and fabric  and next month  what else is there ahead in projects?
Ooh all sorts.
What are some of them though  Mum?
There's sewing, cooking    machinery and   no  no  machinery, it could be  yes?
Don't know Christine.
Could be you could have all sorts of things sweetheart  We I bet you we'll come out and it'll be right opposite us  instead of missing it do you know what I mean  still it was further up the road than the junction  but the  bus didn't seem to be having any trouble.
No.
There's no queue of traffic along here so far  it seems to be coming through fairly er  well.
No there's not hold up up there.
I can't see properly yet.
Well what I saw was some tail lights going along the road.
How could you have seen it from here?
Back there you couldn't see the road up there.
Aha.
Well you didn't see it from back there  Well there's an ambulance.
Yeah  somebody's hurt.
It's impossible to  maybe maybe somebody 
Ah.
knocked down Christine.
Yeah.
Happy Christmas.
Yeah  that's what I was thinking  it's funny it's sort of  Christmas makes everything better or worse.
Yeah.
Bad things  for a bad thing to happen over Christmas, it's worse.
And if a nice thing happens 
happens 
it's te ten times better.
it it's  better  it's makes every thing more intense  somehow.
Mum my technology teacher said  she erm   every year she  Christmas decoration.
I think everybody does Christine does, we always 
Yeah.
do.
Do we?
Yep  don't we?
Yep  but I haven't
Oh my
I haven't succumbed yet this year  have I?
ha ha.
Or have we  did we buy something when we were going round er 
No  no we haven't bought anything yet.
Erm  there's something up at  Matchland I'd like though  we haven't succumbed to our set of lights yet  actually.
No  well that will be our  that will be our Christmas trimmings that we bought this year.
I always cringe when I see a lorry like that coming on the road  when you can't see past it
yeah.
cos you think well if I can't see any of the cars behind it then they can't see me either.
No.
I always sort of tend to ease off a bit.
I'm afraid that's why I get paranoid Christine and say
Yeah.
be careful of the roads because  a car  can't  erm  can't always stop in time  it's up to you not to walk out in front of them  cos they can say oh well you should be able to stop in time  but in practice if you drove to be able to stop in time if somebody stepped out in front of you you'd never above  about five miles an hour  you know?you must sort of stick to the speed limits  I don't believe it we got  gaining on the car in front.
Still he's a learner again.
If it's a learner he's breaking the law.
Yes he is  ha ha  he's breaking the law anyway.
I know.
Yeah  cos he should have his L plate 
And he's not 
on his .
that's right.
We'll have to apologise  say there was a an accident.
Yeah.
It is true.
Yeah  it didn't hold us up but there was an accident.
It did hold us up  I mean we would have been down there a lot quicker if we hadn't had to
Yeah.
five minutes.


What?
It's alright.
What?
I would have slowed down a lot more than that .
Well you're learning to drive, I'm not .
Yeah  that's right  no reflection on you  it's just that I'm thinking  oh  I ca I just can't see the time when I would ever drive through a gap like that that confidently that's all.
My foot went on the 
But it'll come.
accelerator.
Ah yeah you eased off  that's all.
That 
Only I would have probably braked, changed down  ended up in second and crept past it  on the inside  and then speeded up again.
I don't  perhaps not that bad but  I would have definitely braked  and not just eased off on the accelerator.
You'll have to give these brakes a bit more welly 
Mm.
they are er  in need of a
A service.
Oh Neil's complaining it's started  oh I haven't got enough money.
Ah.
He's just moved into a new house you know
Yeah.
about a fortnight, three weeks ago
Mm  modification to lifestyle
Yeah.
needed.
And his girlfriend got the sack from her job not too long ago.
Oh no.
So she does  she's a florist  flowers 
Yeah.
so she does a lot of flower arrangements and that privately
Mhm.
but as she said you  if you make twenty arrangements and you sell half of them you just about break even with the flowers you've bought to do them.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
Leadless plumber  not legless,legl leadless oh  You know I'm sure that the  this roof rack  I'm sure you can feel the difference  in the car sometimes  well not feel the difference but you can hear it, it makes an awful noise at times when the winds blowing.
Mm.
You know?
Yeah.
You think  urgh!
I hate driving round this with the rack on  I absolutely hate it  if it's windy it's  awful .
Mm.
It sounds like fire engines going off above your head.
Oh Brian annoyed me on my lesson  I pulled up to the Kingsway  right?
And I was wanting to turn left
Yeah.
going along the Kingsway coming back from the driv the driving test centre
Oh I know.
yeah?
Yeah.
And there's a filter light  and he said oh you'll be waiting here ages put it in neutral  just as 
.
just as I did it the bloody filter light came on
Yeah  he's silly 
and you oh 
I don't know why he makes you do that  I mean it's  if that was something the I mean all Tony used to ever say when we were at traffic lights were  if you want to  you can put the handbrake on at this set of traffic lights  if they were downhill
Mhm.
because erm  there will be  oh what was I it's alright I was concentrating  said you can put the handbrake on these set of traffic lights if you like  because you might be sat here a while and your foot will ache  you know?
Good grief  wha I always have to put the handbrake on at traffic lights.
No  he says it's a  Tony used to say to me it's entirely up to you  hi traffic lights coming up hill yes  but down hill  no it's  you needn't you can sit there wi ready with the foot brake.
Mm  yeah Brian's argument to that is  that er if you've got  if you were hit  in the back
Yeah.
you would tend to raise your foot off the brake  sort of jump and take your foot off the brake and you'd go forward and hit the car in front.
Well the handbrake is only a parking brake the handbrake only o operates on two wheels in any case
Mm.
not four  so the handbr I mean the fact that you can drive with the handbrake on
yeah.
if you're insistent about it  you know?
yeah.
Erm tells you a lot it wouldn't erm  if somebody hit you in the back you'd still move if you had the handbrake on.
Yeah.
In fact probably you'd move more  cos he says yo your instinct is take your feet off  I think your instinct would be to jump on it all the harder.
Mm.
Cos the instinct would be to stop the car from moving.
Mm.
If you see what I mean.
Yeah.
No then I might be wrong I don't know  but all this  putting the car in neutral  goodness knows what!
It only makes you slower away.
It does it just makes you slower getting away
Mm.
and one of the things is that's important is  hesitancy
Mm.
or la and lack of it  .
But ha I remember I was on my test and I pulled round  er it was very, very busy and there were two rows of cars  and I pulled up  and I thought right there's a gap down there and I want to go straight on and all these others were turning le turning right so I squeezed down through the gap  and then I thought right I'm gonna be here a little while shall I put it in neutral, blow no I won't.


So gi given the  unless somebody's out  unless you're if he'd actually tells me to do it  I will say  I was sort of oh alright and do it.
Yeah.
Yeah but  mm.
No he he makes you do an awful lot of things that are really unnecessary.
Mm.
Well I mean  I passed my test an I weren't made to do any of that.
No.
I would have thought how stupid it was  if I'd been made do it.
Mm.
That's why I think I've said to you on occasions oh  you know 
Mm.
what are you doing that for sort of thing.
Yeah.
I bet your Mum's thinking we're not coming.
.
Can Grandma sit at the back with me?
No I'll sit at the back.
Well no let her sit at the front  now Christine  don't be 
No.
mean.
Hello.
Yep.
I know 


Daddy.

So every everything was held right up so what we did was we was we cut back off  we're coming along the main road cut back off and went all down   Halbury New Road and along Beach Road and around that way.
Oh yeah  it's a long way round isn't it?
Yeah but there was an accident so everybody stopped 
Ah.

Where's your
Yeah

.
her chest of drawers and her desk just won't go.
Oh right.
So what we've gotta do 
And we can't turn it round anyway we tried all ways
Yeah.
and it just doesn't fit.
so what we've gotta do is we gotta buy her desk and we've gotta buy her a little chest of drawers 


so that she can use 
So if you know anybody that wants plain set chest of drawers

They can have it.
Ha.

I won't be a moment.
Do you think they're er taking their money alright   Tony?
I know they are.
Oh.
Cos I did erm  I was thinking  we're going through this fairly quickly  are they really taking it in  so I s we stopped after I re reached a certain point and I spent the next sort of half an hour or so just asking them questions  and some of the things they got right, some they got wrong  so I went back over them until we got it right  so  sort of help to confirm things.
Like that .
What this?
Mm.
Mm.
Lovely!
I'd think it was comfortable to wear.
I don't know  what it's like  mm.
Cosy.
Yeah  sort of warm.
Mm.
These rugby shirts are  they're very expensive  it's amazing there's no way really that they should be  overall  I suppose it it's cos it's a bit of a cross between a sweatshirt and er  but still eighte eighteen pound.
that.
Eighteen pound for a shirt  and the they're lovely these  I do like them but ooh 
So do I  are they not very warm?
They're not as warm as a sweatshirt.
No  are any the same 
You you're just paying for it being a rugby shirt really 
Mm.
aren't you?
Yeah.
Because it's fashionable.
Mm.
Well not

I'm not  because I'm not.
I heard Brad having a conversation again today about  Ooh I don't feel ye I heard him saying why don't we feel very happy about this and not  and not happy with the subjects and I  don't feel very happy about running the session  so  go up this way  he's never done the work you see  so he's trying to learn it from i instructions and things  and  a lot of the time you need to have actually done it to be able to talk about it 
Yeah  from experience.
So it's not his  his fault but  a lot of the training that we have to deliver is to do with  procedures that he hadn't dealt with  whereas  a lot of the procedures  are things that I'm familiar with  there's only some  the job centre stuff 
It takes an awful lot of the different kind of practical experience.
Yeah.
Text books don't teach you everything.
No  and I've got the erm  I haven't got any experience in job centre work
No.
but the job centre work isn't as  complicated .
No  we had er   the marriage certificate and that back.
Oh  good.
Yeah  so it must have been alright cos there was no letter it just said with the compliments and just take it to 
Right  right.
two things back so
So you have to assume everything's okay
Yeah
because they haven't told you.
They didn't   so.
Good  fine  this is the way we operate.
There's less in the jars than in the tins or although the 
Yeah 
tins look look smaller.
Yeah  yeah  that's a cold
Yeah.
Frosty you li you like these chips don't you and there's more in it so  that's a mild one.
If that's alright?
Yeah it is  they're with 
Mm 
the other ones.
That's the other one.
Yeah.
I'll have to get another marzipan another time I'm not
No.
thank you for letting me get that top though I don't know 
It's alright 
if it'll fit I might end up bringing it back yet.
Okay.
But I've ordered a navy blue skirt and I'm praying it comes and if it comes it fits.
Yeah.
A navy blue skirt, that white top  and that nice jumper that I bought in here, cardigan  will look really nice when I go out with Mr  and

No.
It's the same coming up hill  from round there, it's terrible that road.
Yeah.
Can't see anything coming over the horizon  cos it's almost on top of you.
Yes  no I think once I turned round in that way and I wouldn't 
Mm.

Oh you turned in did you?
Yeah  Well I think  for safety's sake
Yep  I think you just might 
it's 
get in there.

Yeah.
so he's getting to know you now  that's what it is.
Yeah.
Mm.
It is.
I remember you from last time, but
But I don't remember what you were like.
Yeah  .
Now that's your pep talk.
They get on alright like  but 
I'm not edible.
Oh
Well don't take 
yes she is.
any notice 
 
we'll  on the other one.
Ah.
Ah.
Are you on Fred's cushion?
Are you?
.
He   I reckon he's .
Going to sit down?
That bag smells of Ben  mm.
That bags quite old so it'll smell like a lot of things, it'll smell like  school friends even  Mum?
O if you never  it's quite a while ago but
Oi!
I told you to stop it!
Oh  didn't mean no harm.
Go round this side then  stands there holding her tummy   You can see it can't you .
But the truth to tell  Sunday morning I went up and come in and Fred had his er  cushion and Windy was   fallen across it 


so I think tha Windy's getting his own back now .
Mm.
Yeah.
We didn't do bad at all tonight  seeing we were late.
No we did quite well.
No he's always, Fred,thou you think of him as the policeman don't  you   that John Thaw.
I thought he was the 
Mm.
policeman in there.
Oh yeah.
He's no trouble when he goes behind there  you get and come over to play food don't you?
Yes.
.
Is he quite  it course it's something you gotta gotta get used to haven't you really?
Cos he he'll get more  adventurous .
You've gotta say no, very severely several times isn't it  sort of just push him away so tell that  that's all you can do really.
Yeah  oh he'll get the message eventually 
Mm 
it's a
take a long time but I mean  I know it says  got well puppy mess to get over yet.
Get over  yeah.
Mm.
I mean Ben  now even now he has relapses  I mean  nine times out of ten you ca he ignores you when you  too much 
Yeah.
and it he'll come up and just cuddle into the side of you without 
side of you and not take any notice.
taking any notice  erm  Mum will give him titbits  occasionally  and  you've gotta work hard then to get him out of the habit of it.
Of it yeah.
Mum so to be a little bit weird.
Mm  it all looks a bit weird upside down cos I can't see out of my  no that's fine.
Mm  I'm just  I'm just drawing a shadow  don't worry I am going to shade it all in and I'm gonna 
You can have some 
blow the  
You can have some branches that curl back down here too
Mm.
they don't all have to go up.
No.
They can curl back down here.
Yeah.
Mm.
Cos they won't all go up on a tree.
A few gaps  maybe just a little bit coming out.
Mr Who?
Mr All!
I've started doing some card for that.
Oh.


We haven't got very many presents yet have we?
We really haven't got into it yet 
.
Mm.
I  we went out and we got er erm  a suit so we were laughing 
Mm  we got off.
did it?
Yeah.
Erm  and we got 
We got about  two didn't we?
Sorry?
We got two  two presents?
Yeah  buy two  and that's it.
I'm
So we've gotta get 
I've gotta get a few for my girl  girlfriends, but I mean  just gonna get them a selection box  and a  chocolate  sweets  but er
Did you go up Sunday  to the shops?
Erm  we washed the car in  today, we  we didn't actually go shopping, no.
No.
Yeah  we just  really thoroughly did the car out  but that's all we did  we didn't go shopping.
You can get a straight twig without anything on it, can't you?
Mhm.
Or you can have twigs with bits joining on together can't you?
They do vary.
They go all different ways  twigs.
Yeah  they vary.
They'll be like one another ha.
Mm  and my art's not too good I'm afraid.
That's not bad.
What's wrong with your art my love?
Is it complications or what?


Can't draw properly.
The way she said my art's not too good .
my art .
 
Funny  yes really hilarious!
Well it sounded like it Christine .
Oh dear.
that twig joins there.
My art!.
No look at it 
 
I mean that is suppose to be a tree  does not resemble a tree at all, you'd think it was a  carrot!
Let's have a look.
Antlers!
These  they don't 
 
they don't  join onto the trunk like that.
No they go up  thick in thick ones and then come out from the 
Mm.
if it was me I'd draw a thick trunk and lots of lines  come out from it .
Mm.
You don't I mean you don't see a tree with a flat top with all the branches coming out do you?
Mm  well I can't think of any other way to draw it though.
They come out it in  thick ones and then  the thick ones are on the  thin ones are on the thick ones.
Have you got an old piece of paper?
I'm terrible  let me rub out the entire thing and start all over again, yeah?
Yeah it's the best thing, I find.
Here I go.
And you branches  start off  what are you going to do?
And rub out.
All of that.
Yes, that's right.
It'll be a mess 
No.
Christine.
No  get, let  start off  yep  on erm  show you 
What  I've just rubbed it all out.
on a bit of paper.
Yep I need a separate bit of paper.
Daddy I have in my bag can you get that out?
A little spotted bag.
 
I can't find a bit that   Give me the pencil and let me show you.
I'll get  you'll have to go just go right to the back  just at the back  otherwise you're gonna be flipping through millions of pages.
Okay.
Can I do it on there?
Yes  yes okay.
Look you start off and you've got  your trunk okay?
Yeah.
What haven't you got  you got two or three perhaps  two big ones 
Can you turn that up.
coming off at the trunk  see like that
Mm.
and you  
Oh I see what you mean now.
another one like that  and then what happens is you've got smaller branches  lots of smaller branches  coming off of piece
Yeah and then it joins up together doesn't it?
and then you've got smaller branches coming off of the smaller branches
Mm.
and it makes twigs.
Yeah.
So you've got  an this this branch will keep going  perhaps  until it gets really tiny.
It's incredible cos all the little bits join together I mean what's that?
No  they don't they cross over  and they tangle up  but once a branch starts off  it doesn't join on to another one.
I didn't mean that  I meant  when you look at a tree it's sort of got
A cris-cross.
yeah sometimes you get a tree like  with a little bit coming off the side
Mm.
and then it's sort of joined together onto another branch and then there's a branch there.
No  I don' know what you mean.
Er it's hard to explain I can't explain that.
As Daddy says once they come out they don't join onto another.
You see that one would sort of 
Mhm.
carry on  going and that one would go up behind it.
Look Christine if I draw it 
Yeah.
as a diagram rather than as a tree.
Right you've got one branch
Yeah.
you start off with one branch like that
Mm.
now that branch will divide into to two  or you'll get one  one bit coming off the side  you might get another one up here
Mm.
right?
So they're going to go  see then you get other branches coming off of that one
Mm.
the same  and other branches coming off of that one  and other branches coming off of that one  it's sort of gets smaller and smaller and is gets
Mm.
so you  you've got  perhaps two off of there  and then another one off of the side of there  and as you go it gets  it gets sl slightly smaller each time  see what I mean?
Yes  and it comes to just to to the 
to the 
light one then you stop don't you?
Yeah  that's right  see  see what I mean?
Yeah.
It ge it you just sort of keep going until it  stops  
Right  I'll clean that up and start again  this is brilliant!
Mhm.
Have you seen that?
Yeah.
Mum?
Nun .


She can't find the stereo  Oh lovely .


Pulling out one by one oh no  ooh!
The worse thing I've ever done is wax for my legs  I did it once  mhm
I never did it.
What happened?
Did it work then did it?
Yeah it literally  it's like sticking a sticking plaster on your legs and pulling it off.
and tearing it off  urgh!
Only it holds onto the hairs so much that it rips them out  so that you end up with  legs with no hairs on it but  ah!
It's best done very quickly.
My legs have never been hairy.
Mine are the only  actually they're not as bad as they used to be  they need doing now but    Daddy's  so they're not too bad.
No  some people it if their hair's dark and it don't matter what length 
No.
of time  they don't do it.
No mine aren't too bad really it's just that I don't like being   having said that I had one .
 
Mum  so there's my basic trunk, trunks aren't straight aren't they?
They never  straight
No.
straight, straight are they?
No not sort of  bits sticking out  Windy  Windy  hello darling.
Let her go.
He's beautiful  good boy  yeah  are you a good boy?
Ben  go round there  can't wedge through 
Hello darling.
oh ar alright then  you've got him now!
 


I'd be in quick  Oh 
Windy
think he's a lovely cushion 
cushion 
ha  hey  he's got his cushion back  Eh?
Got his cushion back  ah  oh Windy  yeah.
They get them you can do sort of like
Oh Windy  has he got his cushion back?
Oh dear  That trunk divided into  two or three different branches 
Yeah 
I see 
it's sort of does  that
That's right  .
I think you need to make that a bit thicker  so it divides into two 
Do you to as well or  will he eat
I don't know what to do there.
I haven't tried to get one.
Yeah but there isn't a flat top it divides sort of in the middle 
I don't know anybody   
Do see what I mean?
No I don't  a flat top what you on about I haven't got 
There isn't a flat top  it divides  sort of 
Eh!
down the middle.
I see.
Yeah?
horrible   I gotta rub it out it's no good.
Yeah I suppose eventually you'll have to start giving him one won't you?
Yeah.
Cos otherwise er  it's gonna 
No.
lose him.
I'm just rubbing it out a little bit to give me a bit more space
Mhm.
if you see what I mean, right  I'll re-draw all that bit in a minute  this is all gonna be sort of black.
Right  so if you mark in where you want it to split 
I wonder how he'll grow up.
Like that.
You got you you try it.
Ha ha ah.
Down the middle so put the pencil  sort of in the middle
Come and have a cuddle.
and draw the  the middle bit first  do you see what I mean?
Mm  like that?
Yeah  and the other side.
Yeah  you don't 
That's it.
wanna be grown up do you?
Looks like a waterfall ha  then you just do a thicker one don't you?
Then you take that and taper down a bit  and then it's gonna split again
And it can split  like that.
Mhm.
Have you got used to the feel of him now?
And then does that go round like that?
I don't know.
Basically they feel  just   
Mm  you split it down the middle again  so that will go off that way and then that branch go that way  see?
Mm.
when Jack comes in from work  ha ha.
Then 
And then it splits again and splits again.
I can't split it again look at the size of that line  I'm gonna have to  oh yeah I see what you mean.
Mhm.
That's for my
See the branches get smaller and smaller and smaller.
yeah.
That's slightly nice.
Yeah.
I've got  we haven't gotta do any leaves it's just an ordinary tree
Mhm.
of Autumn.
A winter tree.
Yeah  and then it goes  up again, yeah?
Whatever you like dear  it can bend round and
Whatever you like?
it looks quite weird doesn't it?
Erm  and I think I may do one in the middle of there  and then leave that s like that.
But if you were to split that  one and that one again can't you?
He's ever so stupid he'll 
Oh alright then.
lie down with his head  sideways on the floor and his bottom still up in the air.
Yeah.


No don't get thicker.
Yeah.
Ha?
Oh I see that's your
You're a daft dog baby 
yeah 
that's what it is  cos you're still a baby really.
Yeah  oh it's lovely to see him not shaking and coming over to you.
Yeah, no  mm.
It's certainly made a difference to him in that four days.
Oh yeah  you're beautiful now.
You can't get any thinner than that.
Yes you are  yeah  you beautiful boy  yeah 
Can you, you can't get any 
Mhm.
than that?
So now you can work on that one.
That looks weird  Mummy does that look weird?
No  cos you'll fill it in with all the other  branches 
Cos you you fill it in 
Yeah.
with other branches, you see.
Don't worry about the lines in the middle and things like that because that's  it's all gonna be shaded in.
Give your tummy  
So 
yes you are  His tail now when it's down it's still down between his legs but it's li it's limp isn't it?
Yeah, it's not curled up under.
No it was definitely pulled up under his 
Yes  it's just  down.
Yeah.
Hanging there.
Mm  perhaps it'll go to sleep on his cheek.
Isn't that lovely that other hostage got out.
Oh yeah.
There's only two German ones there now.
Yeah, it's amazing really.
It happened so  quickly hasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah  it's going
Yeah.
it's going  
It's we it's once the ball start rolling it
Mm.
get's everybody out.
Oh I'm gonna split that once more I think.
Stand all that.
I like dogs that sit like these  I must admit.
Yeah, so have I.
there's Fred then and  Hipner and they all like being cuddled  to  don't they?lovely  Doesn't he look different to his other parts.
They needed to write 
Yes, he does.
a bit more  and start making a bit more 
Oh yeah.
Three D  mm?
Right  yes
And how you can that you could draw  imagine there's a branch
Mm.
growing out  that way  and then curving up  see what I mean?
Yes I se sort of growing up and then
Mm  but work so 
like that 
behind  so it it's it's growing that way 
Are you gonna come down .
Mm.
No.
and then up  so you scr draw it starting to coming up like that.
He's that bad in those.
Yeah or you can draw it 
Windy!
going up like those 
Windy!
on the bottom  then 
No!
up like that and as it goes up it gets thinner 
Oi!
and thinner and thinner
That's right.
like
No, I do it 
 
but I do it very  artfully and turn my back.
It's that.
That  so it looks as though it's going away.
Then you can split  split it several times as well.
Oh  mm.
What did they tell you  about Fred and me?
I reckon that looks really sort of weird  I don't know why.
Well draw 
I don't know.
It'll look less  the more branches you draw 
Windy  hello darling.
I'll talk to somebody else then.
the more real  it will look like.
Yeah  doesn't look 
Come on.
too realistic at the moment.
Well you wanna  split it as often as you can.
Mm  you saw where he had his thing done.
Mm  slightly it's just a little so  when he's head 
Oh yeah 
just a little tiny   so that takes precedence 
Oh my god!
cos er  it doesn't get in the way.
Ah!occupied isn't he?
Yeah  engaged   you had it .
I'll talk to somebody else then.
And he'll put up with being stroked as well.
.
You can see how he suffered, walking in.
Mm.
I mean if you always  
He stands there for so long and his eyes start to close you know   it's sheer   blink and er
Oh  oh dear  Wendy's dogs used to erm  get on your lap and cuddle down
Aha.
and  they'd jump up on your lap and then very delicate jumping up although  they're quite heavy 
and heavy.
but when they crawl down in the hall they they're no bigger than
Oh no.
you know   
I bet he couldn't get in the smaller ball than Fred can get  you 
Yeah  yeah.
He's determined to go back for that bag, aren't you?
Mm.
It's supposed to look like one of those cycling hats 
I know.
when he lies like 
Mm.
that.
Yeah  oh yeah.
Well Windy's the legs are crossed and we're away  just the legs crossed and we're away  there you go.
There!
He says no  I don't like that.
crossed   no.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh he's lovely.
.
No well
She's trying to do something.
It's gonna take me ages, I thought it was gonna take me .
Yeah .
Know how to do it properly.
No  I think what I'm gonna do 
Have you drawn the  haven't you drawn in another branch yet?
are you?
No I've been doing  I've been doing 
Oh right.
a bit of extending and 
Mm.
I've been doing all this  that  looks nice yes?
Yes it does.
Yes, non  non  alright non
Mhm 
non doesn't look nice non.
I makes you wonder when there is  up there and what's happened to them but this is what we said we found.
Mm.
But mind I'm surprised he was found strayed    Nicole let him off the lead and he's gone phew!
Oh yeah.
Is this all I'm gonna do, just these two sort of long things  and that and then just do those branches there?
No you have to do draw another  branch coming out of there and there and there and there and  you know?
Yeah  yeah I know what you mean.
Little bit longer and he will be.
Yes.
Oh  ah.
Don't you think you ought to put your leg down .
The way he sits   look  Ben  yeah  I love this bit, look.
Little bit of white .
Apart from his chest he's  the only bit of white on him, isn't it?
Oh no just a little bit of feet on 
No, that under  on his paws.
Yeah.
And .
Yeah.
 
 
 
Round his private parts.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hello  yeah  there's a good boy.
My o's  gonna be a snake and I go right down  look at that that's the last thing I'm gonna have to be able to do.
No.
And that  I can't I won't go on my  if I did it going off it would go over there.
Mm that's alright.
No it looks  it looks wrong.
It's alright, Christine.
I want he er  I won't to do it down there it's out the way.
It's amazing how  
No you you draw lower branches off the off here
Just a few  
I'm talking about this bit.
Well that's right.
Yeah but shall I do  a bit coming off here 
That's still  now
like that 
Yeah  looks alright.
yeah  yes
Just leave it like that.
That's what I'm saying!
Yeah you 
Yeah you couldn't sort of get at any where near him to start with.
No  I know.
I'll do one branch coming out of there and that'll be it  there you go.
Mhm.
I'll rub out one of these  in the corner.
No you  you don't have to rub out the line you can just draw  another one as if it's coming out from a bit you can't see.
I don't know whether that's shaking 
Mm.
just because it's up there or not cos it's on the only leg that is shaking  the others aren't .
 
Mm  it's probably shaking cos it's up there my leg does that sometimes.
Perhaps he don't realize he can put it down.
Yeah.
You've got a branch like that
Chris cos they're shaking our chests and that they can't be any .
branch like that 
roll over as well.
I 
Alright?
Well he has rolled over.
And then you could have
But I should imagine they were lying  and stay there 
Well they were  in front of the fire 
something growing out  the back 
Oh yeah he doesn't  there 
You know he sort of 
he thinks that we're all 
again so you sort of 
go go go goes back.
Yeah yeah I see 
 
what you mean now  I think.
Look  look at him .
It's all gonna be shaded in in the end anyway  so 
it Ben 
Yeah.
Don't make it too thin.
I'm gonna fill it in in a minute  don't quite fit  there you go  okay?
Mm it doesn't really look as if it  it's gotta be  about that thick  coming down  do you see what I mean?
They're not  not that thick but certainly that thick.
Oh.
Yeah?
Yeah.
And then divide down like the others.
No I don't think that nerv that's nervous  cos hi his front legs not.
Aha.
No it's probably er a reaction like you do if you tickle him in a certain place they go  don't they?
Well he's definitely a cuddly dog isn't he.
So it goes like that
Mhm.
So why are they shaking like that?
No.
Yeah  odd!
And another one 
 
Like that?
And then I can do them  yeah?
Alright.
Oh  like what?
It needs to be thicker and that end.
I'm trying to do it thicker, I can't do it thicker!
No shapes now.
Sorry?
No shapes now.
I can't draw this.
You're doing fine!
No I'm not.
Just don't give up now.
Gotta colour all this in  it'll take ages!
I
That's cos you're not getting
I'm tryi oh!
What do you think I've been doing!
Yes?
Yes.
Oh it's cold innit?
Yeah  oh he's turning into a real dog.
Yes  I know what you mean   He's not the nervous little thing he was.
No  and he'll get more used to it, I thought tonight was I was I pushing it too far when he started 
Mm  I've taken it off.
but it wasn't it was just that he  probably it was
Daddy  guess what I got  for us?
What?
Guess.
Oh I can't guess.
Aha!
I got  
Mhm.
science  and geography  and I got art  nice.
Mm    ah  excuse me.
No see I must admit I wonder whether your Mum will find too much of a handful  she's already telling him off a lot  you know?
Yeah.
And I wonder whether she'll find bi erm
Cos he's quite tall he can stick his nose into things.
And when when he gets to know us a bit better  we got quite a welcome tonight.
Yeah.
With all things considered.
We did yeah.
When he gets to know us better we'll get a hell of a welcome when we go in.
Yeah.
I think.
That's right.
Now we that's one little dog that I do want to get know.
Yeah  well I think you made great strives tonight.
I know .
There it is.
See Fred Fred knows us.
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?
Aha  oh excuse me.
It's so long  I don't need a map for some reason.
Ah  crafty!
Everybody's seems to speed all of a sudden.
Yeah it ha 
Ha ha!
Ooh.
Your Mum is is really being foolish though with that dog  she's got problems already  he's wanting a chew and she's give him one she  not give him one to him, I haven't tried him with one yet she said  she actually 
Oh 
held him tonight while Fred eat his.
Mm  no that's not good is it?
No you give one you give them both  she 
Yeah.
she'll have him pinching it off of Fred you see
Yeah.
eventually if er  she's not very careful  or they'll be a fight 
Or they'll start 
cos they'll 
Yeah.
fight over it.
Yeah.
New dog or not  you know?
Yeah.
I mean  it says in there about feeding them  feeding with feeding th a dog you use your own common sense.
Yeah.
It's as simple as that, he's showing interest so let him have it if he wants it.
Yeah.
It's not gonna do him any harm  you know?
Yeah.
The diarrhoea and that they're talking about isn't  now it was when they first had him.
Yeah.
Back last week.
Yeah it's o it would only be short term wouldn't it?
Very short term, yeah.
Mm.
Mummy?
Yeah.
Sorry?
These things you bought when you was 
Yeah.
Do you think he's dead?
I doubt it, no  he's probably got too much of an idiot  cos he shouldn't have let him off  and he knows he shouldn't have let him off.
Oh Dad  my 
Aha.
I mean it's to set this up, it's about maths
Yeah.
she wants   about my maths  he wants  he's   so

Yeah it is drunk.
Unless it's    decided to 
Yeah.

It's screaming.
Can't hear it screaming.
I saw him he was dying to do that  go back 
Yeah.
I guessed it.

Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
Stupid place to overtake!
Next week I'm at Kingswood on Tuesday and Bishop's Grove on Thursday.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to find your own way to Bishop's Grove.
Yep.
After all this I've had with being late  you know?
Yeah  If I'd passed my test I wouldn't have driven there anyway.
You wouldn't?
No  don't know the way.
Oh.
Oh  I've got a horrible feeling I've forgotten to put the milk in the fridge.
Well we'll have a sniff at it and see what it's like.
No we won't.
Why?
I'm talking about the milk that's in the training room.
Oh  has it ever occurred to you  to take a bottle of milk in from home  save going out to buy it?
Erm
Do you think  they 
well it's cartons
ah.
and they're easier to get rid of  I'd have to bring bottles home again wouldn't I?
Well yeah I suppose you would.
And I get the money back.
I'm quite pleased with how I got on at work today  with the amount of work I'd done  that 
Good.
that erm  stops  see it?
No.
It's he's gone by  ran across the road and went down that
Oh.
slope.

Yeah.
Must sort that out.
What's the matter?
Just checking 
Oh thank you for that I was forgetting what it was.
Sorry
It's alright I thought you were trying to cos of the door
I didn't wanna put you off.
or
No  I was just making sure the tape was still going.
Probably would have been enough for them, but
It's not worth making the  fighting your way through is it?
lesson before my test
Yeah 
I'm driving along and there was somebody  coming round  and it was a bit narrow and so I hung back and let him come through
Yeah.
and he pulled up next to me and he said  wound his window down he said ah chicken!
What did you say ?
Were you annoyed or
No  I think

slightly!
you could have got through there  you chicken.
 
Oh it's quite funny.
Oh great  I like that  No we've seen a fo we saw a fox the other night, Christine didn't we?
Yeah.
It ran across the road, it even 
You always see the foxes I never see them.
Well when you're driving along you're looking a long way ahead that's why  and anything that comes in the road you see it  Oh I hope whoever was involved in that accident tonight was alright.
Yeah so do I.
Urgh!turn that off.


It always makes me think because last time we saw an accident like that it was Penny  you know what I mean?

I said yes .
Oh dear.
Mum this is supposed to be a silhouette  it looks more like a black tree to me  ha ha  it's supposed to be a silhouette.
