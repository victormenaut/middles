And I will , I can't remember what it was but  I don't think I'll get it again.
They'll find me at Nagines, where all the girls are dreams!

Lots of times!
Lots of big headedness!
Yes !
At least I practise what I preach.
Sometimes.
How many more of those records have you got to tape?
Mm.
A fair number, but we're getting through them.
Have you sorted out which you've done and which you haven't?
Oh I know.
Yeah I've wrote it all, booked in.
Aha.
Looks quite tidy now.
You're getting all methodical in at last.
Which is blooming what I said 
Well I was thinking

I was thinking it might, seriously, and we used to say  hands up all those who haven't seen the sea?
Oh don't go back i 
Forest of hands, bar two.
And er  well I er  I was one of the two.
The lad next to me he'd been three times!
His hand went up just the same.
Life doesn't change much does it?
Well!
You get the twisters don't you?
That's not twisting, that!
And probably, mother said about the linen and a suitcase  not to, not to put a hand up.
And yet, the one who'd been, he said I've been twice hi his dad  se , er  rides stallions fo on those two wheel tongas to the, take the coal to co , to .
And er, so I mean  he was pretty well, he kept about six shire horses, those big
Mm.
big plates of meat horses, and er  there you are, that's how it goes I suppose.
Your getting as bad as my Aunt Ada.
What?
Being out of breath?
Keep telling the same old tales!
Is she the one with a teapot in suit rack?
No.
No.
 
She's not.
I could see the foreman now!
He come across with his un one of the managers and he says  what's the idea?
He says  of where you get er, you've got a so , cup, a saucer with your cup of tea, he says we never get one!
I said well it's my wife's er   aunty .

Said they had to  two 
Oh yes!
factories into one.

They had to concentrate.
Well they had to get their own  machines out an there's one old boy had a stitcher, a be he looked ninety, he probably wasn't, and er  he was chu , it was just after lunch and he was chewing  apple  and old Jo , I was working with  so you know, Jim someone's  I said look at the silly old B, I said!
He's really enjoying that apple, I says  er, and it's a  waste of time   er, eating anything!
So they look at me!
Oh Jim we got a big  four foot o , you know, opening in the floor, lowering the machines  and bringing them up.
He nearly fell down for looking !
But he were really going at it you know.
Mm.
But er  that tickled Jimmy that did.
But still, if you can't joke you can't do anything can you?
I know.
See  children with skateboards they amaze me!
Mm, I know.
Anyway , I bet they cost seventy pound don't they?
No!
They don't cost that much.
I think they're about twenty pounds.
Now, what have you done now?
Straight down these trousers!
Saw it  it's going in.
Do children still go errands  er for old ladies?
Mm, I think so.
I don't see any round here.
Well
I used to be, and I was 
some of them.
willi , willing and a a kindly nature but  we if it's in the middle of a game  you know, and er, you know how you are when you're playing a game  well they'd fetch me away to run  for some cheese for an old lady.
And I, I ran there and ran back to continue my  game, at play like  and I heard a,mo , her say to mother  well I like your lad to go  says  th look at this cheese it's never been unwrapped  he said those other lads he says  it's always looks as if it's been unwrapped and 
Mhm.
a bit broken off!

Water.
and a big cap.
He said er ooh  go go and see if we can get a jug of water, he says er  wash my cans in.
Mm!
Really?
It's anybody's guess whether it was the cans or the milk he washed out.
But still, that's life!
Mm.
It doesn't change much.
I used to run, pick ladies smocks up down the tailors.
Course, it wasn't like it is now.
It was all tailors.
Oh no!
And er  you don't see lady's smocks today do 
Mm.

That tickled me to death!
When I told our fellers  when I got back to the depot  wouldn't believe me!
Yeah, they go got it and swung it up like that, and I'm sure to the stallion couldn't find where it  was !
I thought well, what a carry on!
Mind you, if they got big hooves like plates of meat  you know, great big
Oh yes.

Mm.
to lift up onto a mares back.
Oh shut up!

And er  they were the sort of things you had to do.
And in, you know  Woodboy Street Sunday night  in the summer when it was a heat wave  they'd got little bow windows then in  Woodboy .
Mm!
two foot from the cobbles, you know, like 
Mm.

Yes, well it's Sunday night and they're always fighting and that  and he, he came out  four rows of the bow wi , they were twelve inches square  he kicked three of them in!
He said I I'll show you who's boss of this house!
And, that was his idea of showing who was boss by kicking the windows in!
Mm.
Funny that was.
Then another Sunday there were two ladies  one had got a bread knife  and she cu , tried to cut her hair off.
And ne o , nearly scalped her!
Mm.
Oh life was rough there!
In pla , in  Woodboy Street the police used to walk in twos!

That's all altered hasn't it?
Oh, not much.

I got on well with the teachers there before I went to Bridge Road.
The  lad I played with, he  you know these steel  fash , er  what they put in ladies shoes now  strip of steel  in the ar , see the archway?
Mm.
And he'd got a strip of steel about four inches  the half inch  and he stuck at the back of his,i it was a  long seat that were a  four of us sat on with iron legs  and they stuck it in the wood and  you'd flip it and it i , you know how it would sto 
Yeah.
shur shur shur shur shur shur shur,and this went on for a week an little teacher, Miss , she called out  stop doing that!
And she ke , said yo when th , one day when there was, went out for play time  quarter of an hour  they rang the bell, she asked me to stop and help her with some papers.
But I found out afterwards that was a subterfuge.
When they'd all gone out she says  er, what's that noise they keep making?
I says, oh it's a  bit of a spring.
She said show me.
So I walked to the  last bench what seated three pupils, I said, there it is look it's stuck about three inch.
She said, well what does it do?
So I flipped it, you know and it went 
Mm.
shur shur shur shur,so  she never said no more, just hooked it out and er  took it the desk.
But she never remonstrated with er  Len  his name was, she never i , remonstrated with him.
And er  I was out with him, his er  his dad was dead  his elder brother was crippled, and he had a job of  is wo Wilkinson and Phil Kilpacks next door, he did something with the  sweets and jam I think.
And, he couldn't walk properly.
And er  he er  we used to go there and play with, you know, three or four hours and  keep him company, like.
And er  we , one of the few times my dad came to Foundry Lane he  I got a book, I think it were called Tiger Tim  and, on the back they gave  a model that you cut out with scissors  and pu 
A comi , a comic type of thing?
Yeah.
er, at the back page  about nine inch by six  wi you, were cut-outs and  you cut it out and stuck them together to make a little  paper, well, thick paper model.
And er  oh it, it were about seven o'clock and I said I'll go and play with Len   ti till half past, he says well be a , be back by half past eight.
And, my dad ever suspicious says er  what are you going to do?
I says, well  going to take, er cut these models out and stick them together I says he's, he collects them.
Anyway, when I come back about half past eight as I was told to do, you know, there were no disputing it, you couldn't sa , say half past eight and be nine, like they do today, my dad says er  where's the model?
I says, oh I've left it there.
Ooh!
He says, how can you cut a, and make a model and then leave it?
I said well he's got a sa , brother that can't walk, he's crippled and  sits there all week and that, does a little job for Wilkinson and Kilpack  and er  quite annoyed!
You know, he thought I'd  been telling him a lie.
You know, as I hadn't brought the model to show him.
Mm mm.
Mm.
But I took no notice!
I hadn't got much time for him and he knew it!
He used to say  you can't go out and kick your boots up!
And I put a toe out of one of them!
And i , it were just to show his authority, you know.
But mother used to play him down alright.
Yo , you'd only got to tell mother and she'd soon be after him!
That were the best when she chased him down
Ooh !
Yeah !
Fetched him out the hou , er out the factory!

Ah this is it!
Taffy goes back with Petra .
Just read it out.
No!
I will.
I can't read that little bit.
One of the last jobs of Leicester  serviceman Taffy   he retires shortly  has involved working on a machine of the type he first handled fifty years ago when he joined the B U.
The machine, an original  Boston Tacker from the early nineteen hundreds was prepared by Taffy for showing at the exhibition this month at Wellingborough branch.
The organizers of the exhibition wanted a  Boston Tacker to stand in the foyer to tie in with the theme of the seventy fifth anniversary of the B U  locating  however, locating the complete model has proved something of a headache like the Model T Ford, the  Boston Tacker was always very common but is now something of a rarity  and the branch had finally settled for head to be borrowed from C and J Clarke, shoe machi , museum in Street, Somerset.
Luckily, Taffy returning from his annual holiday remembered that there was a complete  Tacker in the factory of a local manufacturer  still being operated.
The directors of the firm kindly gave B U permission to borrow a  Tacker for the exhibition and after Le Leicester branch arranged a temporary replacement, Taffy began working, cleaning up the machine to showroom condition.
Taffy spent five days cleaning, polishing, painting  he copied the motives which were missing from and old nineteen hundred and eight B U machinery catalogue  which he examined with a watchmaker's glass.
Taffy  spent the  majority of his time at B U  as a serviceman at  Risden and Leicester branches, but had an eighteen month period during world war two assembling jet engines at  Powerjets, Wexton His wife  and he lives in  Spencefield area of Leicester .

Well he don't smoke much.

I in fact now, he doesn't smoke when Madge is in the room.
But I still think
He waits till she's gone to bed.
Mr Churchill had nine inch long cigars sent him at Christmas  and 
Really?
he was smoking like, and he were ninety odd!
Yeah.
Well they daren't sa , er
What, how do you com 
Yes, well.

Yes, but they used to say cigar smoking's not as bad as  cigarette smoking.
Cigars 
Cigars.

Mm.
That's what they 
I shall be up 
that's what they say 
There's there's more in this 
and Tom only smokes a pipe now, he don't smoke cigarettes.
Yes, but there's mo more emission from a cigar in a car than  a cigarette.
Well he just didn't smoke in cars.
Mm.
I don't know.
And do you remember  we went to er  David's er, one Sunday with me  to his grave and when we come out of cemetery that public house across the road

You cou , it ju literally, you, you could hardly 
Oh I know!

A and it was down steps as you went in.
Wasn't above the ground, it were sort a  three feet below the ground.
Mm.
So there by hangs a tale.
Mm!
Mind you, you can make fors and agai , er fors and er against for most things can't you?
Course you can.
Over eating  can do it can't it?
I mean, look at er, George Bush in America, he's  tried to act like forty, as I've tried to do  a , and you have to pay for it.
I mean, it's one thing  running along the road before breakfast when you're twenty isn't it?
Well  no!
Another thing you'd be e ,yo you have a, you eat more when you're old, or appear to.
No you don't.
I'm eating more than 
You don't eat  no you don't!
You don't eat  nearly as much as you used to.
Oh!
Oh well.
Seems a lot when I have to go through 
How?

Ah!
But I was nine years in er  digs.
Yes, I'm not  disagreeing.
And you don't get  they don't overfeed you in digs.
Well, that was when you were young!
Cos the whole object of the exercise is to have a lodger  is to pay yo your way.
Ah I know.
Well you needn't go into all that.
Well that's
I know but you 
It's a known fact, we'd still do 
you don't, you 
Have you pressed that?
You are now recording, yes we're recording.
Recording.
Oh so that should be alright then 
Yeah.
shouldn't it?
Have you mashed the tea?
Yes  after all that  
I is there anything else you want to  fix?
No, after all that trouble changing the  I don't know why it went 
 
went wrong the first time do you?
Are the birds coming?
Yes.
They've ate all the seed  and that bread's still there.
I'm making a cup of tea.
Has the robin been?
No  
Is there some salt on is there?
Yeah.
Well he, he often is.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
The robin was at the back door.
I've thrown another handful.
He's getting brave.
And the blackbird.
Do you want some whisky in your tea?
Er  yes 
You're not going out.
might as well.
Er is it 
 

Is it still recording?
Yeah, no I dunno it's re going round.
I didn't know whether you'd put the, stopped it.
Mm mm  
No you can leave it, might as well leave it on.
Yes.
Well it's funny it's working this time int it?
Well there's so many things to go wrong int there?
You've gotta watch it all.
Is there any, do they want any bread?
Or have you thrown it all?
I've thrown some out.
Mm.
They've got some.
Ah after all that trauma .
It's going to be a bad frost tonight.
I know, shall I  put the gas fire on, as well?
No, I'm warm enough.
I'm not very warm.
It's getting dark isn't it?
I mean you did the same with that as you did with the other didn't you?
The only thing that was different is that, that  it's not starting on the same
Well you get obsessed with that but you're comparing it with yours.
I was just sitting figuring it out.
You're comparing it with our 
You know the ones you put in?
thing  with our system.
Well no y she couldn't put the B side in cos she s you've got to put the A in.
Yes.
You put the A in.
The only way you can get it 
A 
right would be putting the B side in but you've gotta start with A.
It's rather curious that.
Well you, you always do on yours when you're recording on our er set don't you?
But you're obsessed with the position of the, the tape.
Well  I compare like with like don't I?
What's this one in here, the d 
Leave alone and I'll sort them out.
Well  that's what I'm saying.
Well  
Ah, there, that's it.
That's it.
Now do you want any cake with that second cup of tea?
Yes I'll have a slice.
There's not
Have you got much left?
Yeah there's half of it left.
Oh.
Yes but if you're not here you won't will you?
Well I shall be in a minute, I've only just got to go in the kitchen and get it.
 
No!
It won't matter for a minute or two.
On my daughter's wedding day ten thousand pounds I'll give away.
On second thoughts I think it best to put it back in the old oak chest .
How big ?
Normal.
Some folk sing opera, some folk sing jazz, some sing like sawing wood, I sing like that.
But when the dickie birds sing in the trees I think we ought to try and sing like these.
Well what's all that in aid of?
Let's all sing like the birds can sing  
You needn't sing on it.
Shut up!
tweet tweet tweet, tweet tweet 
And eat that cake.
Is it as good as mine or better?
come from there.
Yes   Is this as good as mine or  better?
This is Madge's cake.
Ooh I think I like yours the best, this is a bit heavy.
It's not heavy!
It looks like rain or snow.
I think it's too cold to snow.
That mark's gone off my arm, I think that erm  bandage was too tight.
Well you'd better leave it off then for now.
Well I don't know, it's
Well if it's better for you I should.
I don't know that it is.
It gave me a bit of support but
Not much, I wouldn't have thought much, it's elastic.
I know but  I should have thought by now it 'd 've been  better.
Look in the doctors' book, it might tell you how long  you have to suffer.
Well I think as you get older you take longer to heal.
If it's, if there's not any frost we could go to Sainsburys in the morning.
Mm.
And do some shopping.
A bit of shopping, yeah.
Unless we go on the bus.
Hmm don't be silly!big shopping on the bus.
Besides it doesn't even go in till about  about every hour.
Do they go on a Sunday still?
Not very often.
Well I'm alright for everything till about Tuesday.
Mm.
How, you know the last time you saw the doctor, how long did he say you'd got before it completely
He didn't say.
Mm eat all that cake, you're not giving that to the birds.
Mm  
They've not ate, ate half the potatoes and bread that's there now.
You're not supposed to speak with your mouth full.
Hmm.
There goes the marzipan, all on the floor.
You cost me a fortune in  soap.
What are you giving that cake to the birds for?
I told you not to.
What are you giving that to the birds for?
Is this your handkerchief on the floor?
Is this your handkerchief on the floor here?
I think so, that's mine.
Mm.
Now finish that cake.
Any more tea?
Yeah, please.
You've had two.
Well I'll have three then won't I?

I'm looking for the  German U boats, when er  that's the beginning of the German U boat
U boat pens.
Evelyn took some of these with her little camera and it weren't very good.
That's er the mystery one Ian took.
But I took some better ones.
Shows you what they was up to, aye that's it.
Tom won't be interested in that.
Look at that then Tom.
That's what we was up against.
Great big deep submarine pens 
And that's only one that's only one part of it.
you know in er near La Rochelle.
No wonder we didn't bomb them.
They were s 
No they're very very heavily fortified aren't they?
Mm.
Look.
he wouldn't know that.
they had three or four lots.
Would you like a drop more sherry?
No I'm fine.
Ooh you've not drunk that yet.
Have you seen the satellites erm y you know, our satellite places?
You know, down in Land's End?
Oh those, no, no.
Satellite dishes, we went t when we went to Falmouth  they took us on a trip there, it was interesting.
I think that's a bad 
Is it on the downs?
that's a bad one 
Er yes, that's it, erm
Is it  Goonhilly Downs 
Yes  Goonhilly Down 
Ah yeah.
And that's one, that's one Evelyn took and she got the light in but  that's it look.
Gosh.
And th they're marvellous things.
They're huge aren't they, really?
Mm.
And there's not many men working on them, you know, it's all sort of great big massive dials and er
Ooh.
How many how many of these dishes are there?
Ooh quite  six, all around a big field.
Oh about six.
Six of them all all round this great big field.
So w were they all pointing 
Cornwall.
in different directions or?
Mm.
Yeah.
 
There you are there they are i in all directions look.
That's only a bit of them.
I think I took some of those, I've only got a
And that's, that's the fence 
well 
round round where  
when, when Arthur bought his camera I said to the man er  do you think I'll be able to  use it ?
And he said 
 
he said well  so he said I'll give you this one.
Lit it's a little Russian one.
But it, it's not go not got any gadgets on.
It's pictures.
But they've got a picture of sunlight, cloud and all things like that.
But it doesn't take some bad pictures really.
No 
No, no.
I mean I do I can't  
What do you think to the submarines Tom?
They say it was only a part of it, you know, because we only had half an hour, didn't we, there and then
No we had about an hour or so.
Well not too long anyway.
I recommend these bus things though, abroad, they were lovely weren't they?
Well you fly and
What was that, that with the boats in the  in the river?
That's Thames isn't it?
Int that the Eiffel Tower?
This is, er yeah it's the Eiffel Tower, not the Thames, the Seine.
Yes Eiffel Tower.
Not the Th er S yes, the, yes 
I, I saw that and I thought  
Yeah it's the Eiffel Tower we went on that boat.
Mm.
That's what, oh no we were on a boat and we took that, but it was a similar boat to  what we went on.
Oh yes it is  the, the column of the Eiffel Tower is hidden by those buildings isn't it?
It's just 
Yes.
behind it, it looks as though 
No we took we took er  that was, that's a lovely trip if you go to Paris.
I'd like to go but Tom's not that interested.
Well we only, on the way down 
yes.
 
on the way down, and it was a lovely Sunday morning and er, you know, it was
Yeah.
well one of the girls said to me who sort of tagged on to us, she was on her own,er she said er what was the highlight of the holiday and she said that trip down the Seine
Yeah.
and the Sunday morning sort of all round Paris and all that.
doing a trip, you know, a two day trip
Mm.
you know trouble is it's, it's either May weekend or it's I can't get the time off 
Yeah there'd be a lot there then.
but you know I'd like to go, you know, say a couple of days.
What about your Yugoslavia?
Well I know I went four years running  
Yeah.
It's, it was, it was er er sheer coincidence that Beverley had been to Crete the year before and I said to Jackie we've been to Yugoslavia four years, do you want, do you want a change or do you wanna go back to Yugoslavia, she said well I'll, I'll have a look, I said how about, how about going to the Greek islands for a change
Yeah.
she said alright, and we changed and Yugoslavia came out like that.
Yes and you 'd 've had to have cancelled anyway wouldn't you?
One of our friends that we'd met were there, they'd been there a couple of weeks
And they had to come back.
a week before the July fortnight and they had to come back.
I always wanted to go but when Tito died I said to Arthur ooh it might be a bit risky.
And then it got that it blew over didn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
And so w 
Well I mean when we  to go I mean the tourism and they were just 
we've never been.
beginning to bring them up, you know 
Yes.
give them a better style whatever, yeah.
Well someone gave me a lovely address in erm  mm 
But they made us so welcome, the tourists, you know they were fantastic.
Mm.
Well I know everybody er I've spoken to really thought
Yeah.
and it w wasn't too expensive originally was it?
No it wasn't.
No, no it was cheap i i i it was er when we first went 
It was getting expensive.
Yeah.
it was a lot cheaper than here and when we last went it wasn't quite as er as cheap there as it was h it, it was always cheaper than here but not quite such good value was it?
Mm.
No.
No.
It was still very good    
Have you lost your headache from this morning?
Sorry?
Jackie er er said you'd got a headache this morning, has it gone?
Oh yeah.
all got it at work, it's being in an office.
Have they got flu?
When one gets it everybody gets it.
Mm.
There's, there's several had the flu and there's three of them next to me with a headache yesterday.
They all we 
Mm.
were quite pale and I thought here we go  it's me next .
And er 
What about Bush then?
He, he passed out didn't he?
Collapsed 
Yeah.
that was terrible.
But I just remember  
But mind you he's a bit he's a bit silly, looking back  at myself er er three year, or was it two year back, or one?
You know I, I've got a big laurel and it was coming right over what we call the roundabout so I decided to have a go at it.
Well  I got some foot long  pruners but the branches were hitting our thing and I were doing this and, you know, and now I've got 
And that's what's  shoulder.
a frozen shoulder in each, when I go like that in bed, ooh it's terrible.
And er I thought I can do what I did at forty, and I did it, but look what I've got now.
Yeah.
Mm.
And that, getting back to Bush, he's doing the same thing isn't it?
He's been jogging, he's doing some footballing  
Well it's  the pr the pr the pressure, the pressure on him to be 
Take that picture from the  it's come off that hook.
Yeah it's handy to put up 
Well my, I rang my  sister, said are 
That's a really good picture that.
you coming round tomorrow afternoon?
Tom .
It's a bit odd isn't it, to say the least.
because it's her er daughter's  birthday and I usually give a present to take round .
Ooh she said er I've got a bad cough.
It seems unusual.
It, it w it would have been nice to have asked him, you know, how come they took it?
What was the reason for it.
Is that the one that was poorly over Christmas?
Yeah.
Because it's not very high up.
No that was  young sister.
No it can't be can it?
No, no.
It's not very high up at all.
Unless he's got a er
Mm.
er er  
Well I was out there watering at time scares was on and I had this letter and  planes did come over and I laid me ho hosepipe  down, I mean you know  so he wouldn't be able 
 
Well planes are always coming over cos there's an airport just over there, that's right,airport.
It's the aerodrome  yeah.
Yes but why did he say why's my grass greener than everybody else's?
Yeah well that was just a comment, silly.
Ah I don't know.
I don't think they could say anything, as I say there was no hosepipe ban then anyway so  
You say just a comment comment, what about that letter we had ?
Yeah well  
It seems to be a pain in the neck me cleaning the  sometimes there's a lot of dog dirt, on yours as well as mine, and I, I  and they were quite er happy to do that, yet it seems to irritate somebody over there.
Still.
What about Mrs ?
 
Nice isn't it?
Breaking her ankle.
Put those 
Put them on the floor Jackie.
How is Mrs ?
I've not heard.
She came across for the first time today, I was out  egg yard getting some eggs
Mm?
and she  poddled over, she said she'd been across to Fernbury Lodge for the first time
Oh
yesterday.
mm
Cos I thought she m I said have you been to the shop, thinking, I meant up here
Mm.
and she said no she'd been to pay her poll tax over there, she said she'd had a rest in one of the shops over there on the way  
Mm 
back, so  
She's doing alright.
I didn't think they were like that, did you, these satellites?
Oh!
You know.
Ah these, I thought they were  yeah  I was trying to think.
I think, they, they're quite large aren't they?
Mm.
I, I've not been near one, I wouldn't know but  you have to stand next to them to get an effect, to kn know how big they are.
to get the er how big they are yeah.
That's right.
Mm.
And it showed you all the sort of  countries of the world, you know, on lights and, and that, and which light was for which wh when they took us round the er 
Oh that was interesting.
control room you know.
Well yes you, you know the  De Mont the stage and the organ and all that?
It looked just like that 
Mind that glass!
er and the man was sitting there at a  looked like a lot of 
A telephone  
looked like a great big piano, you know, with like the buttons and he were doing this  and they've got every country within range on the wa on whatever it was, wall or a gantry, and if that wasn't too, too good he, he were doing something and it come up.
And, and, and all, he'd got all countries' television er going, you know, so you could look at any country at the moment, the moment it was producing.
Mm.
I thought it were wonderful.
Aye.
It's er marvellous.
When we were kids we'd never of dreamt of this would we?
Oh no.
Yet the kids all seem to er  adapt to it just like that.
Yeah.
Very very 
And the, the son-in-law's got a, a computer hasn't he?
And his 
Mm.
the little one, she's only four,
Mm.
and er D er  er Dave was showing me how it works and he went out and the little one was saying I'll do it for you granddad, look this is how you do it, and she starts typing away, and she's four!
Four!
Just, you've gotta go on that, and she presses it and the chart thing which is  press that one and it'll get rid of it all.
Doing and it all disappeared.
And I thought ooh f you know, we were   
I know my, my sister's er grandson, he's had a computer, he's fourteen  and er  anyway, oh he wanted a bigger one costing about eight hundred pounds.
And now he's, they've got one and I think it was about five hundred pounds, they bought this one s but they managed to sell the other one for about a hundred and fifty they say.
Mm.
Now he's got that, he says he wants a wordprocessor.
Mm.
Mm.
And they're expensive aren't they?
Er yes they are.
Ooh he, he's m mind you he, he reckons that's what he wants to do when he's older but  I mean the life, or the career of anybody in computers is not very long is it?
Because they're changing so rapidly.
Yes, yeah.
I mean my, one of my friend's  sons, he was a computer man, he was working on his own but he's in his  I should think he's getting on for about forty six  and he was doing freelance but this recession  the people who er the firms who were employing him are using their own staff  and they're not calling on him now and er  he's not done any computing for twelve months.
Mm mm.
The building n next to us, where we are, you know  do you, on  
Mm.
Street?
There's a big glass building next to us, have you seen it, it's 
Mm.
quite huge?
And that was all, that was all computers, all computers.
Yes we kept going there when  yeah.
Th th that's going now
Yeah.
because somewhere er headquarters, they're going to do the work for all the region, so therefore they've gotta go
They're, yeah.
So all those computer people are out
Yeah.
and you think Christ what's 
Well erm I mean  Andrew, he was very clever, he went to university and as I say now he's nearly fif getting, getting towards fifty  well even so he's buying a house and last December things got so bad  he took a job as a dustman  a at Anstey, he lives 
Yeah.
at Anstey, and he said well, got to pay the mortgage.
Yeah.
Mm, that's right.
I mean, I could be er  mm maybe  they're going to give us numbers on the seventeenth how many 
What as to 
how many people they're gonna keep or not gonna keep so 
Oh 
we don't know who's gonna go or what, you know, it's quite worrying really but er 
Oh it is really isn't it?
Well you see he thought the Gas Board was here forever you know?
Well you do don't you?
But
Well since they've gone private
And especially these computers where they change every 
Mm.
every few years don't they?
It's, it's er 
they employed 
Yes  
they employed six thousand people and when the  came they all went to Law Street adjacent to the factory so they could walk across to the job and er look at it now, they've smashed it all down, it's gonna be an Asian big store.
It's all been levelled now and taken away and they employed 
No they're not, it's supposed to be being used  
six thousand people.
I don't know whether you go down Valmer Road do you?
Not very often no.
I went, I went there about two years ago to Walkers Crisps and, that's just next door to er .
I went by but yeah a lot of it's all down, there's still, still a part being kept though isn't there?
Mm.
Oh they've still got a small part there.
Ah that's, that's the American section.
That's right.
Mm.
American United.
That's the  
We w we was  partnerships you see well  when our place collapsed they carried on  just carried on a bit because they were connected with Japan.
In fact er just before I retired they were saying, you know, my job's obsolete and that, and then  and says oh we're opening up a big depot in Japan.
So you see it's gone there you see.
So you  just retired in  retired just about the right  time.
Mm.
you know, it's gonna be difficult to get another job now, so 
You're in the drawing office?
Yeah.
Cos I've been silly in the past, I've told Evelyn lots of times and  we had a new machine, a rapid na nailer, it er  nailed er army sho er soles onto the  at five hun it used to do three hundred and fifty nails a minute and we m made one just for  I er went out on the road, er to five hundred a minute you see, and er we were building the first half a dozen and er  er there's two pawls at the back of the machine 
Ooh we don't want to know.
Ah but th th th there's a rack and w one goes on and holds the  horn post up to the boot while it's driven, then it comes out  and there's two, one's half a tooth, so it ensures one or the other's in, and they work like that.
So I was spinning the cam round, it hadn't got pinned to the shaft, just spinning it round on the shaft and these pawls were doing this  and Les , the top one, he went to Kettering and then Don, the next top one, he went to er 
We don't want to know all this.
r er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden, and er this top one,, and his mate come out of the toilet, been for a smoke, and er walking by I said hey Les, look at this, and I spun the cam round and it went bang and stopped dead.
He said well you've got no bloody springs on the pawls, I says  so I picked a tin of springs up, we kept it for anybody who wanted a spring for their bike, any spring where, you know the hooks on each end?
Mm.
Well they broke off in wear and when you was overhauling a machine you'd throw these springs in the tin in case you ever wanted one.
And he said er  oh he says er er there's no, your spring's broke.
I s so I showed him this tin full, I says well look they do break don't they?
Anyway, do you know the easiest, er and at that time five pound were five pound, if I 'd 've gone to the foreman and then the er  
Drawing office.
drawing office, I 'd 've got five pound on a suggestion.
Anyway in the fullness of time er  went to er
You said that.
near Kettering, Don went to er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden  and er I'd been there about a year and all of a sudden there was a call in for Shorteners at  so I went down on the bike and er  what er the one over me who, who was elderly, well wasn't over me but he was er  he was on my job but the senior man on it  he come in, the boss had sent him in to have a look cos the er Shorteners were complaining, and er then they rang up for one of us, he said well I'm not leaving till I've solved this problem so I had to go.
But er  all he did was, you know the two pawls that go in and out?
He made a bit of eight inch wire, like er a U piece, and the bar at, bottom bar of the U held the tail so if the springs broke the tails didn't duck under and smash the cam.
It'd smashed the cam and, and the lever and bent the shaft  colossal expense at that time.
Mm expensive  
Now him and his mate says ooh  er you, your spring's broke.
Now I were bloody daft, If I 'd 've gone to the foreman and wanted to put a suggestion in, I, I, I 'd 've beat  sure they were crowing abou when he got   but I was first really wasn't I?
Mm.
I, I'd seen it before it happened
Mm.
you see, and three more went like that eventually but er he got the dough and that was it.
That was it, mm.
And Evelyn always says I'm too diffident to push my plate up and
Well, he used to come home and say that and I'd say put a suggestion in but
Mm.
Mm.
if he did I  had to write to out for him .
Mm.
Still we didn't do too badly.
Anyway how long have you got to go before you retire?
Ooh eleven years officially.
Ooh.
if it was up to me I'm 
Mm.
gonna go in nine.
I shall go at sixty three at the latest, I'm not going on to sixty five 
Not staying longer.
and it might end up 
No, no.
There's certain rumours that there's no  
Still you might get a a big redundancy  pay out if you do.
Well  talking about a year's salary  
Is that  
You get a pension of course but it depends how many years 
Yes you get a pension.
you've been there and I've only been there thirteen years so
Oh.
that's not
Not as good.
they said about a quarter of my salary didn't they?
Mind you how many years were you in your pension?
Not all that many.
From the beginning weren't it?
No you weren't
No?
the B U didn't have a pension scheme till after the war.
No, no.
But talking about pensions i 
Do you get a pension in yours?
Only my own what I put in, no.
I've been paying a full stamp since nineteen seventy four.
Yes, it's a good idea isn't it?
Yeah.
The sad thing is  
Well my friend never paid 
Tal talking about pensions Tom, the chap er cha with the office girls and that and, and checking our expense sheets, he, he er they put a notice on the board  you could ante your  what, in your pension, you could a put a bit more into it  and I were looking at notice and he says ooh he says it's no good for you, he says er  w well I told you about it didn't I?
Yes.
And I said ooh 
He said ooh he says you won't get no more if you retire.
So I mentioned it to Evelyn and, being an office-wallah, you know, and any, any e extra money she were all there, she worked it out says ooh that, it were another ten bob a week you see, well we've been 
Which was a lot in those days.
Mm.
Well you had a rise as well.
we've been glad we've been glad now haven't we er
So he anted his up.
I mean ten shillings was a we a we was
Mm, quite a lot, yeah.
years ago.
Yes but we're glad  now .
Oh yes because now  mind you the B U pension's quite good because every year we, we get a p a percentage increase
Mm.
Mm.
but I mean ours doesn't, mine doesn't, I mean mine's only a small one because I haven't done many years there.
Ours goes  cost of living it says.
But er, oh that's alright if it does but the B U is, is, you know, a really good one.
Mm.
But you've got to get some years in to get a really good pension, but I've got thirteen and  the maximum you can get is forty years but you get, then get two thirds of the salary you would have got,
Mm.
your own salary, so that's pretty good for a pension isn't it?
You know.
Still perhaps you get the earnings  thing don't you?
Earnings related as well sort of thing.
That's being stopped though  
Has it?
It's gonna be in the year two thousand they're gonna wipe it out.
Oh, oh  
So that's it.
Oh dear I'm not  au fait with those things now.
No well this is why w you know like my girls have got just to take their own  now.
Take their own private ones see,
Yeah.
Yeah my nieces are doing that, Audrey and er well her husband's self employed so er
See all the firms I've been to up till the Gas Board just gave you your money back for your pension.
Yes they did.
If they could have said to you would you keep it and, or transfer it t I would've said yes please.
Well they can do now, in those days they didn't.
But they, they could but they they didn't in my day, they just 
No.
gave it to you back and you got no choice in the matter, that was it.
No they didn't, no, we didn't in our place.
So that was a shame really as far as I'm concerned.
Do you reckon the er 
Mm.
Although Peter my friend's  he, he did that but er it didn't come to much, they 'd 've saved it or something, one job, cos he was made redundant about three times  and er  one, one place he was at  they're supposed to have kept it and paying him it now but I don't know how they came about that bu because actually they we played him a dirty trick, they persuaded him to leave his job  and then about nine years or probably less than that later  you know and he was out again, redundant  and, you know, I think they felt a bit guilty but he only gets about five pounds a week from, off that one, which is  
Nothing is it?
No.
Er er do you reckon we ought to have had, you kn you know we went over to gas, I toyed with the idea of fetching that   do you know, you know when this house were built we went looking at a depot where they've got all these grates and I took th funnily enough I took the measurements of the breast   and er  the only one we found was just that  dead on look, right across
Is that recorder still on?
Oh yeah  
Oh ye yes, yes it's still going.
Oh that's alright, finish one tape.
Tape and
Mm.
well we shan't finish that lot shall  we at this rate ?
Well if you, if you finish three we're 
You can't very well go in a pub  can you ?
No not really.
You've not seen Jackie's new lounge 
I er 
have you?
No.
It's beautiful int it?
Well it will be when it's finished, the curtains are 
Have you finished?
Well they came and fetched the curtains on Thursday, they've got to go back.
Why, what's the matter with those?
Not level, the dining room one was two inches shorter one side than the other, the tie-backs 
Really?
were all creased, and the lounge 
Ooh  
is like this!
They weren't level at all.
They came back 
Ooh!
back and they were disgusted so they've taken them down and gonna make me a complete new set.
Oh, oh I didn't know that, mm.
Yeah.
And he suggested tie-back is, cos it's, the pink is the thinner material, they're gonna pipe it instead of what they've tried.
Oh the machining was dreadful.
Mm.
Who, who was who was the
Well Maples, they contract out to this 
Ooh!
workshop
Oh I see, Maples.
But
Cos they should be good there shouldn't they?
Well this is it, the man was disgusted, he said oh dear.
Yeah.
They are very good though, they come when they say and they, they d they do something about it 
Oh they've been very good, oh yeah.
Mm.
Yes.
they don't just leave it, they'll go and do it, you know?
They've very good  
Mm.
Cos we had Linekars, course they've gone out of business, but when he came, when the boss came to this one  he reckoned one of these was  a bit out didn't he?
Mm.
But this, I mean they measured, in fact he even measured the track to see the, make sure the track wasn't level, you know, and 
Yes.
Cos the windowsill is about an eighth of an inch out, well in one place
Mm.
but he still, the curtain was supposed to be something like sixty one and a half inches  one was about a sixty one and the other was about a sixty three one end, you know?
Tt oh that's sad.
Oh what a shame.
As he said it was Christmas rush I think, you know?
Yeah oh of course it was just before Christmas.
But er you know they've just not done the edges properly either, you know .
So they've all gone back.
Luckily we've got the old curtains.
Cos I've not seen it with the curtains  
No  
Have another drink Tom?
Do you want a drop more sherry?
just a little drop then 
Go on.
just a small drop.
You pour it out Arthur, I can't get that cork off very easily.
Tom, here you are then Tom  
do you want some more  
No I'm fine.
 
have a martini.
No I'm fine thanks.
Have a whisky.
No!
You can't mix the drinks.
I thought Tom might have a whisky if he's got a  
that's a funny  
Oh I, I don't want to don't want to butt in Tom 
sometimes I feel I'm sh 
Ah never mind about it, what about  with his new car?
What sort is it?
It's a Ford Sierra.
E Evelyn 
Oh it's the same sort is it?
Yeah he had a Ford last time didn't he?
Yes it was a Sierra 
It's not quite the same, it was erm
Maroon colour?
Mm  
Do you reckon he's given,th there's been a lot of er goings er to-ings and from-ings, do you reckon they've had a whip round?
No!
I don't think he could've been insured do you?
Well there's been no end, there's been no end to it.
Well except for third party, how long 
It's funny, I don't know.
Yeah.
he left it there, do you?
I don't know he's a s 
Mind you yours took a long time, you know that bump Tom had going to his 
Mm, mm.
mother's funeral?
That was April, it's only just, you know?
Yeah but they sorted it straight away though didn't they?
 
Yes but I mean you get get the repair done don't you?
Ye yeah.
Yeah.
I mean that looked a write-off so I don't know  
Well erm
You couldn't  
and he said it wasn't cos he  
Funnily, funnily enough he, funnily enough his car's on that picture   
It is  oh well it is, it's there, yeah.
M Martin said when he  
Have you noticed how he, he creeps that bit, he  you know, he, he don't keep back he, he just  he gets just that bit behind the
Yeah.
you know?
during the day cos our cars are not there.
No well that's what I said i er  and probably perhaps when you were on holiday.
The road intrigues me Tom 
Yeah.
how clean it looks and the, you know the marks, those black marks, they're the joints of the concrete where they 
That's right,
You know they kept  
It looks very clean doesn't it?
Can you see the paving stones?
They're white  
Yeah, mm, that's what, yeah.
I've never noticed those before.
Mm.
Well that's the new bit they did, you know, the little
Do you know y y you, it's a different aspect, you go out here and all you see everything at ground level and you can't really see on top of everything 
Yes, mm,s see low, no.
But on there see you can see all the details can't you,at all.
Mm.
But I was struck, I was struck by the frame.
 
I think that frame's worth it these days, I
Yeah.
I,but  I reckon you've got a bit of money in the fra in the frame.
Cos I was 
Oh that lady who came with this, she said er  Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it, and she said how much did they charge you, twenty five pounds or thirty pounds?
Mm.
So I said no, only twenty.
So apparently  she said ooh he probably charges, perhaps if he's not very  he reduces the price  but  funny she said twenty five pounds.
She seemed to know about it.
Yeah.
And it's funny they came together and she, she pushed 
She knew, not quite together.
in while I were  with the other chap .
No it was a minute afterwards because I thought 
Well 
oh he's come back  for the, this, to show to you.
Mm.
I thought perhaps he'd been to you and  sort of were you interested and he he'd come back.
But it was only a second 
No.
after er sort of I'd more or less half a second  and I thought oh he's come back again  
But, but I had more to do with her than Evelyn but er from what little bits I've gleaned, you know, er I'm a bit into everything like, and I seem to think, I've got a f strange feeling that she's something to do with education and they're worried about children not speaking properly eventu 
No!
Le let me finish.
Er eventually they won't speak real English, with all this Asian kids in  now al all the Asian children have gotta go in any school haven't they and th everything, well sooner or later er this mixture of languages is gonna spoil the English language isn't it?
Bound to.
Yes it's bound to.
No what the they'll do, they'll put all the words that are used into a computer er from all these things won't they?
And then they'll see how many  are sort of used a lot and  percentage and that's what they'll do.
Mm.
But as Arthur says though perhaps some of the Asian words will start being used by the English people.
Oh, oh yes yes.
Well it says on the, on the thing we have to fill in  er  if any of the speakers is of non
Non ra er non English, yeah.
English or something a different race if you like, you're to  put it down .
Because you only have to identify them by a name not  not a 
Do you look at er C Cilla?
not, not the surname, just J John or whoever 
Mm 
Mm 
and, but if any of them are of  not U K origin
Yes.
you've got to put it down and say which one it is.
Do you ever look at this Cilla er Blind Date?
Oh did you see that tonight?
Yes  
Did you see t what do you make of that blackie with that lovely  lovely young girl, pretty as a picture, and he were doing this round her and leaning back, and his great big lips  ooh ooh!
Oh I hate it when   white girl gets an 
Well if you were  if she were your daughter Jackie what would you have thought?
I know, well I ha didn't see it last week but Tom said  
No I didn't see it last week.
she liked coloured people or something
Something like that, yeah.
when they were talking to her.
I was, where was I?
I don't know  
We didn't see last week's, I don't know, was something else on?
But Tom said she was saying something about, you know, she liked coloured men or  
Well she liked one of the coloured film stars, I don't know which one it was though  
Well we we're not against, we're not against coloureds, the fact that er 
 
you, you want to keep your race,i if you've got a  an alsatian or a, a bulldog, you don't mix it with a  some o you keep them, another bulldog with it don't you?
And breed your bulldogs else you lose your race don't you?
Arthur don't like 
Sometimes on the television the, the 
do you?
Not very much  
Not really  
they were showing something and er  one of the er Asian lads says ooh I'm English now, and his mate says no you're not, you're British.
This were in a school playground.
Course being at home all day you see we see these things.
That, that programme that follows that, we've never looked at it before, Barrymore er did you look at that?
No  
I've seen it before  
We saw it once before

He's a , he's a bit funny isn't he?
Yes, it was quite good really.
Sometimes he's alright and sometimes it doesn't go very well.
Yeah.
Well he'd got a seven year old girl copying him hadn't he?
Yes.

I didn't see the beginning.
She were doing all this that  and i the audience was screaming weren't they?
Yes.
But she'd got it off though hadn't she?
Mm.
Then they had er  some fatty, fat  ladies, elderly ladies, doing the can-can.
Oh was it the Roly-Polies?
Ooh that was grand.
That was good .
Similar to the Roly-Polies but this was a sort of erm an amateur group.
Mm.
Doing it for charity or  
We did, we did the Merry Widow and we had,th the Gazettes they're called,th the Gazettes and er they used to come out the wings with all this, you know?
And as they run in er and I always thought it was the best of the show.
Oh well er it is nice isn't it?
Mm.
But these were very fat weren't they?
Made it more funny  
Yeah, yeah.
Like the Roly-Polies, they were good weren't they?
I've not seen them lately have you?
Yeah

Cos that, that,th leader gone now, she wasn't there but she turned up, she came on.

Not always.
and he swears and shouts.
I said turn it down, you'll upset Tom and Jackie.
But that was a classic, classic one  they were talking about at Christmas
When, last night?

And er 
Oh w well no you haven't got Sky, it's on Sky

Oh you have to laugh don't you, at some of them .
Do you reckon there is anything on that damn cloud up there?
No.
I, I look at these science things where, you know, they're sending these things, America's sending them, it's been going for two year  thousands of miles an hour, you know, probably a minute  er and the as the man came over who went to the moon, the top man, to lecture and he was asked innumerable questions and one was  do you think there's anything up there?
He says well, I don't think
keep waving your hands about at the window the  pigeons will be conspicuous by their absence.
Well perhaps it'll be a good thing in some ways, we're getting too many.
You'll have no seed left before you're able to get to the shops to buy more.
You know what Glen said on the moon.
Oh well.
They asked him  what he missed the most, he said the birds.
Well we're not likely to miss those are we?
We get too many.
Well you'll miss them if they go away.
I shouldn't miss the pigeons all that much, I don't mind the blackbird and the thrush and the robin but  and a few starlings but I don't like  many pigeons about the garden.
They're too dirty.
They're not.
Yes they are.
Are you very bread hungry, toast hungry?
Oh no I'm not hungry at all 
Well you should be.
 

Well you  didn't have much after your  dinner yesterday did you?

Don't be silly.
We're not going to go out at all then today?
Not in this fog.

What was like an ice box?
The pantry.

Is it?
Oh I stand corrected.
You'll have to go back to the nursery.

I used to think dreams, you sort of stored in your mind, you know, cos as a lad I did er sle once or twice sleep walk  and er  at lunchtimes they used to delegate  er when you was on your last half year they used to delegate one every day to pick 
I know you've  I don't want to hear all that.

and I, I remember mother saying oh we shouldn't wake them when they're
Asleep.

Off and on.
Well it's, more or less is.
About the same as yesterday I meant.
Oh well it looks like being frosty Friday doesn't it?
Well you, you can clear the table and put a few more photos in the album.
How many more cards have you got to fill?
Too many I'm afraid, those thin ones.
Well you bought them.

And I'd thought they'd be, suffice.
Well they're alright, I mean
They're too flimsy.
you can't have everything, they're not too flimsy.
They do, they flex too much.
waft about.
No they don't, when they're, when when they're on top of all the others and you just turn them over more gently.
And we'll go to that new place, Office World.

Mm well it's Sunday morning, people at work have a lie in don't they?
Well I never used to, did you?
I did in my teens, I used to have breakfast in bed on a Sunday.
Yeah you're talking about a dream, because er in my mind I can hear George now in a bar lounge  I walked in, he was with two of his mates  and we got talking, he said here's my, this is m he used to say Chip then, you know, George did  this is my young Chip he said  he goes to work in the middle of the night.
You see painters couldn't start till nine, till the sun got up you know to 
Mm 
they had to go round with a blow lamp to get the frost and the dew  in those big houses
Yeah.
Cos I said to young George, his son, I said  he came when I was painting the sills and  I says what do you do when it's frosty when you start to work?
Oh we just go along with a blow lamp.
. Suppose it's one way isn't it?
Mm.
Here comes the big pigeon, there he is.
I don't think they should 
Look.
Oh yeah.
He's got a white collar you see and also he's very big 
Yeah, I can see.

I should think he is fat on what you put out for him.
Well
Or her.

Looks as if they've cleared it all up, he's looking all around.
There weren't all that many came either.
There were, there were about twenty.
You exaggerate so.
I don't.
Yes you do.
You sound just like my wife at times.
Mm.
Pity I'm not.
Are you glad you married me?
I suppose.
Hmm  you didn't sound too very enthusiastic.
You shouldn't ask the obvious should you?
Wonder how you'd've got on with our Bill 
I might have tamed him.
I doubt it.
Anyway he didn't appeal to me.
Very mean.
He was a r a r a rare one for getting little sharp digs in wasn't he?
Mm like you sometimes.
We went in the Gra Grand  just done the lounge at the Grand and  when we had our first car  and I went round to see mother and I said come on, we'll go up to the, take you up to the Grand and have a drink.
And we walk in the lounge and they've got two foot round copper covered tables, they'd covered the original with sheet  and the the there was only us two and he was polishing them, you know, getting them ready
Mm.
Bill says  you love d er cleaning those don't you?
And he were gonna make something of it, the barman, you know?
He always got these nasty little digs in.
Are you coming back?
Yes.

That yellow one, where's that yellow one gone?
Didn't know we had one.
No I didn't, not recently anyway.
Here it is look, yellow embroidered one.
This one.
Tatty old thing.

I just washed that, that's a lovely colour.
You could have fooled me.
Hmm  not very often.
Now get your cards out and the glue.

You start at one
No

Ah I see what you mean.
and er, if you do it the other way 
Well if it was in chronological order, you want one on the top.
Yes I know but when you come to put a another one on you've gotta lift them all out.

Mm.
there?
It's not, it's not on the 
Oh well that's what I said, it was no use, bothering 
 
there's no use bothering to  how ours worked  you've got to sort of know how this one works.
Well it's nothing to do with the working really,ma , it's the fact that they  with A facing you  the spool is ready to run.
Yeah.
And then, put it the other way i if there were nothing that side you'd have to put it on B because that's ready to run.
Mm.
It depends on which side you start you see.
Well they say always start on A don't they?
Oh!
Well I mean it's nothing to do with the 
I mean you are now  
mechanism of it, so 
No.
the fact whether, one side is full, the spool you're going to wind on is right for recording.
Mm.
Ah, and like 
Well we always do ours on A for a start don't we?
Mm.
You do don't you?
I don't know, I never do ours.
Anyway, are you very hungry?

You'll have to try to do it.

Being a nervous type.
Ooh!

Neurotic  over certain things.
Why wouldn't you say I was a nervous type?
Well, not normally.
Er , what conclusion has it come from?
Well, not in the same way Joan is.

Do, you feel cold don't you?
I did do in the front, er, yes.
Yeah , but you got the radiator on and the gas fire!
Yo , well you've still the gas fire as well in here!
Hadn't you better  sit in your chair for ten minutes before clear up the lunch.
Well it's still winter isn't it?
Got worse if anything.
February's always the worst month.
You reckon?
Oh it is!
Everybody always says that.
Now sit in that chair
Finish?
No.

How do you feel after last night?
What, the late night?
Yeah.
I'm alright.
I wonder what possessed you?
I've not had my bandage on today.

Oh!
I know!
That's a bug.
It's
I never went though did you?
No.
No, I was dreaming, I told you earlier I
Oh!
Well it's what you want with your arm int it?
Course not.
It's still
Rest and more rest.
No!

Oh!
Or try to use it, but it's still 
You won't be able to
I still can't
you won't be able to keep hurting it though, eh?
No.
I still can't carry  anything heavy in it.
But still
Will it be always like that then?
Oh no!
It should go back.
Does Marge ever say
No, she said she gets arthritis in hers  and I expect that's what it is with mine.
Cos I got a bit before when
More like it's the aftermath of the break.
It probably has  it.
It's the only thing I can say  and I think 
Well it's the 
I think 
the silliest 
my thumb
silliest thing to happen isn't it, really?
Well it's happening every day!
I bet after on Friday
Well I re , I noticed you the other  er, last time we went anywhere it  you look one way and walk another!
Well, you have to look what's on the stalls!
Yes, and therefore it happens , you tread on something and  Bob's your uncle!
You should always look where you're treading I was told!
Mm.
I notice you do.
And that was mainly for dog dirt but now it's for  other hazards int it?
Did you put that clock right after  you put 
Which one?
In the hall.
You know, you pushed it on a couple of minutes to show somebody.
Oh!
Never bothered to do it, there's plenty of other clocks to look at.
I know, but  cos I, I think our bedroom and bathroom clocks are   
Tell me what this one is compared to Madge's?
I could tell you.
This is  one thirty four.
This is one  about wo , er one thirty three in the .
That clock's right then.
Oh what about that then!
Yeah.
You must have altered it.
I know most things obtrusively.
Ooh!
Which you never give me credit for.
Have to do all the scenery 
Well done!
but I never pushed in and stood on the stage, look I've done all this!
Well
Some would.
I've seen them do it!
No wonder!
Stop!
Is it that one?
Oh!
No birds about at the moment but they've had a good feed of  chicken, but 
Yeah.

Trouble is its too fast too close in it? all the time
mm
I don't see how any one doing sixty can be three or four feet from another's bumper can you?
no  oh yes I should think he's learnt his lesson putting it on the
I reckon somebody
bashed the other one
well its been on the road 
yeah 
its never done that before has he?
no , no
perhaps somebody didn't like, perhaps he told somebody to stay there as long as he likes
mm
they showed him he couldn't
mm, oh don't let me eat any more of these because there too sickly  wouldn't you like a Jamaican rum truffle?
I mean he had it brought from somewhere didn't he?
mm, yeah, wouldn't you like a Jamaican rum?, here have one of those that's Jamaican rum see if you can taste the rum 
I suppose there he he didn't like to leave it the way, the way it was done
no, well 
Oh, we can see it from back room now can't we?
Mm, if its a good record, yeah, how d'ya like that? could you taste the rum?
yeah
couldn't eat many of these though could ya?
oh no , but there's plenty of lights
mm, I'm glad were not out in it aren't you?
It looks as if their all coming back, their all coming from the shops where their usually their going.
Cos I thought it'd been a nice day we could of nipped down to Sainsbury's
well say when you look at that picture its just a bit er unusual in't it?
well aerial photo is er, bound to be different
he must of come low to took that mustn't he?
unless he had a big zoom lens
Tom seemed to think he come low last night 
did he?
mm
oh I wouldn't know  I mean these zoom lenses are pretty powerful aren't they?
well there is that  wouldn't taken him went off to the ch 
it was taken about last July 
the, the leaves would be off wouldn't they?
July, and I bet, bet my bottom dollar it was taken when Jackie and Tom were on holiday because of how their bit of front garden is all dried up  and that building at the back was completed
about that time, mm 
just before they stopped work the day before the July a fortnight holiday didn't they?
yeah
they'd got little bits to do, but there was 
the front hasn't been, all their rubble still on the front 
still there , but they finished the main building
yeah
at the end of June so that's when that was taken, you ought to of asked him when you saw him today 
can tell his white brick work, that were only done last year wasn't it?
no been done two or three years
mm
you ought to of asked him when he sold it to ain't ya?
eh, it were that lady come quick and he 
no 
he went off quick 
no he went off quick, but I mean before you, while I was getting the money
mm
you should of asked him if you 
I was too busy looking at the picture and the frame 
yeah I know you were 
I were weighing up the value of the frame
not the picture
I like the frame though very much
oh I do its like the mountains 
its  some moulding like that 
well you know 
I bet the mouldings very dear
well you know
cos you know that black stuff well, well that was four pounds wasn't it that length?
about nine pounds a length for eight feet
yeah, summat like that weren't it?
yes, well there's a new shop opened near the showers market, erm new thing  brick a brac its called, we'll go in there  its got, they keep advertising and they've got one in Mayfield Road
oh we'll have a look then sometime
so when were out
so if you don't get it 
when you've painted some more pictures
I if you don't bring wood worm with it 
no, well the you, they've got mouldings as well as the frames
mm, mm 
you've got to paint some more pictures though haven't you first?
we've got a, got a picture of those just, er, with er you know with the flowers on, so be, really wanna is to make them back to the original, see they had nowt frames and I cut it up but
yeah, pity you didn't keep the frames
yeah, oh well I did for quite a while 
still I like I'd like them as they are I did 
but there was in the coal, well they looked a bit heavy on the wall
yes they did
you want a big room really don't
well if you see any in the Antiques Roadshow you'll know what to do
yeah
see if they are valuable these days
well there just cast your look, but I think cos of the frame was a modern looking
yeah, cos you changed it for a
yeah I don't think he looked at these last too much
no, well if they come in handy
they, those people don't like it altered in any way do they?
mm, well if they come again I shan't let the say were not selling any more bits
no, I'm sure the landlord I'll
well I don't know we've still got plenty
his entitled to the
in he?
well there not finished yet are they?
well that one is and the one in there
that one's not its not got the flags on the top 
well the one in there is
well they, they specialize in
nick knacks
no, in certain things either
well as far as that stoat didn't offer them any thing because they, a chap about forty he reached it
it was, it was all tough weather scale of six, on, you know, and I said what, how much is that up there?, and he said ten shillings, I said a little bit dear in't it?, cos ten shilling then was ten shilling
mm
and he says su its a good buy even for that says, it, you know, its a hundred years old, oh well he says it was continental, but er
well it perhaps wasn't just what he was looking for
no  well he knew what he were looking for, something worth when you think
no its not 
I bet they come across it as well 
what about those painti , that painting before he had the market stall
yeah
it were rolled up in a wood set er cardboard cylinder and it fetched half a million didn't it?
I think it was er 
I think it were a lot of money 
some painting of some homes in er a desert at night, it had been missing for er nearly a century
I er, the Antique Roadshows on tonight 
how much was this? mm
so we'll have to see
best of it is he hadn't taken it out of the
roll 
roll , roll you know the box
well he put it in, probably didn't put it, must of taken it out to of looked at it surely 
it'd look like that might of been looking in the markets and that 
oh I know 
for that thing
well you've done quite well really haven't ya?
yeah
collect so many bits  Val buyed it didn't she?
yeah, oh
that teapot and plate
she did well to of got them didn't she?
and what else did she, that tobacco jar oh no 
its a pity 
you bought that didn't you?
pity, I wonder what if we'd of had those what they would of offered, but they went for sale 
I think 
and they only fetched twenty five
no they didn't, they fetched seventy
seventy was it?
remember you said that thirty five of that would of been ours any way 
be, yeah yeah
but I think a lot of those about they get astronomical 
they, they also there a dangerously expendable on that corner of 
mm 
that shelf wouldn't they?
mm, you'd of knocked them down 
er you you'd of knocked them down wouldn't ya?
you would have, or I would have 
yeah
you going to make us a cup of tea?
I will if you so desire 
those chocolates have made me sick, take them out of this hot room
what the chocolates?
mm, put them in the pantry
I thought you were going to put them inside here
no I've had too many, I feel sick
I've eat er four some
well there the sort that you only want about a couple at a time at the most 
well one , one a day I should of thought.
How
I don't want any thing in me tea
no
I put all the things ready
what you say?
I put all the things ready, but use the tea in the old, empty the old lot out before you fill it up, I put the packet there ready to open.
Don't knock your tea over
I shan't
have you done it?
yes
you know what's happened in to get in free er this was around there
oh they were cos he got a guarantee slip with it
do you?
yes oh you bound  
get in free now 
that's why it was a bit difficult at first to break down
are they gonna give it us then, when they've got it?
of course they don't silly, they made about twelve pounds or they were, I don't know what they are now
I seemed to remember, you know when my school was about
mm
I seemed to remember he had one and put it at the back of one of his chairs, and
I don't remember 
there's something on the radio and I were commenting on it and then he all of a sudden he played it back, oh, er, it was about then probably 
oh, oh I know that 
probably not as good as
no there not the same sort they were bigger a few years ago, I wonder he's getting on?
probably dead, most of the people we know are dead aren't they?
well you know Gillian  the couple who lived next door who went to live at Burnley ?
mm 
she kept in touch with them for some time  but er, I've not seen her for a year so, I wouldn't know.
I feel hot now, do you?
No I'm just right
shall I put this fire out?
yeah, alright
I shall get too hot 
we shall all end up in the same place 
mind you, not that I'd lite, the fire, not the glow  that's what you did one night put the
yeah
out
yeah if er 
and er left the fire on all night, oh
if, if there's any thing after life do you reckon Hitler's managed it?
no, doubt it.
Well if Bill had come today
mm
if we'd of asked Bill I don't think he would of liked to of come 
he would of come, yeah 
not in the frost
or George for that matter, it was
I'll ring him up today 
okay I, I get forecast
well that's what I said to you, but we didn't want to er visit again this weekend did we?, with last weekend 
no 
having Madge and Tom
well Tom's his own, he can come one day if he wishes
yes, but I was gonna say er, he wouldn't of come any way in the fog
no  he doesn't seem bothered about electrics does he? erm tapes and things 
he doesn't do the electrics
tapes and things
well I don't know, he's got a, a record player
oh
that it, well he, that his son Phil taped
tapes them for him 
tape them well tape them for Marg, I don't suppose he's done any since Marg died  no
mm
they bought it for Marg when she was ill  and Phil taped you know a lot of his records and some of Marg he'd got and that was it I suppose that's what sort Bill plays now.
why he didn't 
You can fill my tea up
he didn't, he didn't seem to me to be er a mus 
not too much sugar 
a musical sort of chap, does he you?
well I think he likes  never give him a, a chance when he's here
why's that?
too much gabbing 
that so 
never stops talking  I want it filling up, not washing up
what you say?
I want the cup filling up, I thought you were washing them up
no I was washing the
no I want, I want another cup please

Mm what you like , your choice 
This is a nice cup of tea 
About time I finished that saw in't there?
I thought it was finished
well perhaps
linked it up and used it 
but its too cold to go in the garage now
it is really.
you know that back door key, I seemed to remember picking a key up thinking it was the  garage key
oh
when I went in for the steamer
you perhaps took it in there then, for  
and then I found out it was the back door key
mm
and, and the garage was unlocked so I didn't bother, I probably put it down when I got the steamer out of the cupboard 
mm, I'll got and have a look in a minute
well you needn't go in the cold, I've got a spare one in the drawer .
Was that one of the book's you got out on Friday?
mm
cos some of them are getting
ah, well better take them back after a while then
no, you needn't, needn't take those you got out last Friday, its the earlier one's of which will be due next week I'm sure  cos they've put up the prices now, its about ten P every day you have them out.
The thing is there's millions of books and you don't see all that many people
well, don't you remember I had to pay one pound fifty something last Christmas
still I suppose you've got to pay the assistant
well it comes out of the Poll Tax, we pay enough of that  oh yes there's a
a
no er a hair lip, Mrs  I think her name is no the lady Mrs 
didn't know she'd got one
well she did have one it, she's had an operation, but er, I, she manages to go to the post on a Sunday afternoon, she must write to her sister in Australia, which makes a little round trip, a bit of exercise  that's what you ought to do more of
what?
walking  keep you fit  its a bit you had a hair cut last week if you'd of left, if you hadn't of had it done you could of taken this thing down to
with you and recorded that 
oh no 
once he starts, its something
you'd soon get into some arguments down there wouldn't you?
yeah
telling a tale

I don't know, you'll have to see, I mean switch it off and 
they might play a record you see, might'nt they?
well you'll have to see what it is
well I can't till I've tried out one we've got
well I know what's on there, it won't be the same, its not, it won't be the same songs or items, will it?, they don't repeat their repertoire their, there not different items  I mean if we did and it was  a repeat you could always wipe it out, put something on top, couldn't you?
Have all the birds gone?
They went a little while ago, apart from that they never came on this end
well yesterday the black bird was there and they ate till late, I think, I think they roost in that er holly bush
possible, I suppose it, the waters always there and they've got a wall at the back
mm and that I, I think they do and the robin and the, that one starling and the thrush, I think they all roost there  cos they seem to be about every time you throw stuff out   I just remembered Tom's father worked at er, the electric company
mm
in London B T H or G E C, I remember he told us that the last time  you know because he wasn't called up in the war he was reserved.
Ooh can you see the fog now swirling about, look at it
ooh
you look, its all swirling about 
mm its getting thick in it?
mm 
nice to see the front clear
yeah it is, kept the kids in today 
seem to hang around here like a magnet don't they?
well
you never see them across the other side
yes you do, you don't always see them, what have you done with your glasses?, oh, I thought you might be sitting on them again 
have you thought about a holidays?
yes, I shouldn't mind going away  in a few weeks, if, if
mm
it looks like being a nice
would you like a change from Wales then?
I wouldn't mind going on a bus tour again
mm, what to France?
no, well I wouldn't mind going there, but, I meant for a first holiday, a little holiday  I mean you enjoyed that did last April didn't you?
yeah, its nice in your own car though in it?
I know, but you don't have the hassle though in those buses do you?
only hassle if holiday, big holiday is when everybody's
ooh I don't know
we got to Wales quick enough that Sunday didn't we?
oh yeah, yeah 
so  see the thing is if you wanted to go, see, that Sunday half way we did didn't we?, don't you remember we had to cross the road?
mm
if you put that on a worse bit, but you could and that 
well you get, get lots, lots of stops don't you?
you won't like it very much if you 
yes they do you have lots of stops 
yes, but none are appropriate
yes they do 
there are twenty aren't there?
no
some days they've been about four ah?
well it was like till nearly five the other day
I expect had enough sitting around wanted to get back to the bit like mews 
like mews 
well it can't be very pleasant sit up there
no
all day, every day, can it?
no well get plenty of food any how.
Have you given them all those potatoes?
Well I crashed them up and its er, it ain't, I made sure those two slices, but they didn't touch them.
I think they've gone off potatoes a bit 
well you've
about any way, so
any way I've only got enough for about two 
its not only children's programme, the young chap said to the bird expert which is the best er potatoes or bread?, oh he says potatoes every time
mm 
see bread has salt in it doesn't it?, still potatoes do don't they?
expect they do, well you always add some potatoes, salt to the potatoes, but er, I've only got enough for about two days
oh 
so, the weather had better improve, I'll just have to buy some more from the milk man
what bread?
potatoes I'm talking about
oh I'll got across the Co-Op for me paper in the morning and get the potatoes from the shop no problem 
I know, but there not very good there, about three times as much
yeah, well why ain't they any good then?
well those people have them in stock for a long time 
they seem to sell them don't they?
I don't know, most people buy them in bags today, those in, those across the
mm
Co-Op the other week were horrible
how many have you got, another day?
I've got about enough for about two days, might be three 
that's alright then
I should think the weather will change before then
mm, er, got a bit of revert back to the nice 
I've not heard the forecast today have you?
that's
no I doubt it, its
well I've had, had a little of
oh I had to switch it off it was no good, it was all political wasn't it?
mm , give it time I mean its talk, talk, Churchill said jaw, jaw, but you can have too much jaw, jaw, can't ya?
Did you read that er a bit about him?
the documentary that their going to put 
yeah 
which will, it'll be interesting you see, listen 
says you won't like and then
well he was a bit of a slave driver I mean every body 
yes, yeah
knew that  he was a bit bombastic
mm and he didn't do so well in his college days did he?
ooh he wasn't very bright
yeah
or he didn't try, well he didn't have a very happy childhood did he?
no  in those days
well you didn't try when you were at school, you told me yourself
no, I didn't bother  and next to me
I mean a lot of it depends on, or perhaps his par well if his parents didn't really bother about him 
mm 
he said his mother didn't and then I don't suppose 
well my mother were out working and my dad was non existent
and then I suppose er in those cases like yours  children don't er, unless their sort of erm pushed a bit  or the parents show an interest in them
oh you know the Meccano things?
mm
try to that there was a clip on it, but
mm
he bought me one for me Christmas, he came at,lo you know, loader with er, what's that in the bar, loader with erm
I don't
when Jesus were born?, any way, this thing clicked on and er, it, I, showed me how to do it and I ain't got the strength, of course the war was on and there was er people were borrowing cups of sugar and er, probably, any way I couldn't clip it, he says oh he said to er mum, oh he says they clip on easily, but I couldn't
well your finger isn't 
the next then we moved from Archlin Lane to Founder Lane, where next Christmas I had Meccano that could screw with screws
mm
mm I told you about Bill wanting it
yeah
and then after Christmas dinner I built this windmill and mother and I liked it and he said well its only screwed together, I nearly said well you wanted it any way, see, he wanted it and yet cos I got it, it were, any body could have it
any body could do it you mean
well that's the same thing in't it?
what time is it?, is it time to put that radio on?
what that, three, four minutes  oh you can put it on if you like
well just try it and I'll tell you what, I don't know  him 
er, rather throw suspicion that
it won't be the same
its the same thing
it won't be the same songs, radio two
what, what I could do I shall put these on and see what it at, starts and quickly put
no, its, its, Palm Court, we want to see Those Were The Days at four thirty
mm
just try this Palm Court see if its worth recording 
well its 
its not on until about two minutes past 
well I can get it ready now

they we are 
Those Were The Days was quite good this week
Yes very good, is it working?
Yes I think so, didn't you like it today?
yes
didn't know about that fish, did you?
well I've read, I seem to remember something about it
I mean you've gotta remember all those years back all those things can you?
mind you for yea , when old Charles's said we crawled out the sea
yes  but it seemed a bit far fetched, if they said that 
but any then look at it like this
if that's been caught now why hasn't that  changed
well it's the stoppage in evolution 
well in sixty nine or whatever
but, er, you look at it like this then, if we didn't crawl out of the sea and er evolve then did we just appear like a flash of lighting 
no, no I'm not saying that we did, we did evolve 
oh 
but
we must evolved somehow 
why hasn't that fish that they caught recently evolved?
yes, well I used to read a lot of story books, travel avidly and I think I forget all about the author and the story, but I remember one portion where they discovered a depression in the middle of a continent where it was in excess of and they'd grown quite a different specie
of what men?
the human , human's, you know I know it's only a story 
I know several stages I know that 
eh?, but er
I mean there were several stages before they got to present day man, but
yes, but they do know,le let's go back a bit further, but they do know at the beginning of the world most of it is water
yes
so it's quite feasible 
oh it is 
if, if, if it was three quarters water er human's must of been in the water to start with
well not human's, but
well whatever we comes 
antecedence of humans, mm  I don't know
I mean we've still got a barren at the back, somebody kicks you at the back on that barren and er in the skeleton that's exactly like the barren in a monkey's tail
mm
so at one time the theory is we our, we did have a tail
mm yes, but we didn't have a tail in the sea then did you?
and then another thing you got 
fish don't have
fin finger nails, well surely millions of years ago they were claws
possibly
then you've got your two prominent teeth, they could of been the tiger's two teeth 
mm
and then there's another theory with your feet, you know that bit of skin between your toes, they claim that was web at one time
well isn't, you don't know much of
not know, of course there's a, wears away with lack of use, but when you're in the water you want web feet because there 
yeah 
the water I'll go through your fingers
mm, mm
this, this skin here
yeah I know that 
it's not pronounced in mine , but, some er they say that with where it's gone away, you know, there's all sorts of things that can prove it  I mean the obvious thing is we came from somewhere didn't we?, we didn't just drop here with a flash of light  and er they've studied plants and other animals and they evolved.
Yes, but plants evolved with men's, man's
I hope that they, they had had on their own for 
 
a million years, the plants did
I don't know, probably several hundred million years  mm, can't really understand them  can you?
well, you'd go mad if you tried wouldn't ya?, like that man said the other week, er, you, human's invented god, well they did didn't they?
mm, did you take that tape out in the other room?
yeah, to cut, cut a in that
oh did you know 
and the other thing 
do you know where it is because it in't in this 
yes I left it there to call off 
oh I see
well if I've left it there to call off I'm not gonna put it in the case and shove it away 
well I know, well you want to label it so you know what's on it  just reminding you, you say, oh you'll say you didn't remind me to write it down
yes cos you always right, you remind me at the wrong time and the wrong thing
no I don't
yes you do  oh I was gonna say something, you put me off now
mm, I'm always putting you off, I put myself off  you don't concentrate.
well you're alr the, point it's greater the things they find it, that er three quarter of the world were water once
yes I know, you said that, you going to have the Antiques Roadshow at
and then there's another thing, yeah, if you like, another thing Evelyn, you know when they give these rock,foss fossils out of rocks
yes
big sand stone rocks, they find things that fish today er had, had got other pediments that million years back, same thing, but not, not, not the same as they are today, you know, well they must of got hold of it to be different from a million years ago
mm
those shell fish things they're always on about in they get out the rocks
five thirty Antiques Roadshow  on B B C one, it's in Cleethorpes
ten minutes then
huh, from Cleethorpes  I shouldn't think they'd get much from there, oh they might get some ships might they?
yes don't 
they might get, erm
true, then there's another thing about religion I've often wondered, they say you go to heaven don't they? well, so well 
well, no 
no, but some sort of place, well when, when you look at these pictures now, the satellites been going twelve months, still going through 
two or three years
well where's heaven then in all that lot?
no
and how'd, how'd ya get there when you're dead?
well you don't, that's just
well then, why do they carry it all on?
well they don't really so much today, people
yes, but you talked, listened to a parson on telly, he's convinced what he's saying true, yet it's only what he's been told in it?
mm 
with all this killing of children and that and burning them alive with flame throwers, what, what if this higher, high of command, why don't he interfere
there isn't 
he did in my case
what'd ya mean?, huh 
well wait in the Cathedral and out
and prayed 
and prayed, when you left me
don't be silly  didn't really leave you  you were just being stubborn weren't you?, still are.
Did Ken a member of church he didn't did he?
Ken, no, no he always went, not church, chapel you know he did 
oh did Tom leave?
no me dad used to say he was an atheist when he was courting Madge
oh they don't, he don't believe in it now I don't think
and yet, yet, the children went to chapel
mm
come
 
 
but I mean I went to a church school 
well probably Madge, Madge sort of 
well obviously they were going to teach me religion weren't they?
in a church school, yes.
but you know the breaking up day for the summer holidays and Christmas
mm
the vicar used to come and sit at the back and, you know, they used to do a little turn, you know play in the bands
mm end of term 
wanted that old , is it, the rag and bone people, you know, rubbish, and er I suppose somebody taught him and er he, he played in that and er you know did the little towns and the vic the vicar used to come and sit at the back, a seat under against, under the window and watch, perhaps he thought he'd er get some little co 
well I expect if it was a church school they had to put in appearance odd times .
er, yes .
No Madge, Madge must of sent the children to chapel
mm
I don't think Tom probably approved, but she  well actually when they used to come to us on Sunday I used to take them to er, to Belver Fall  me and David, Thelma's husband and he's er, his father was a superintendent  so, do you want any tea?
er, only ice cream if there's any

washing 
washing and ironing and cooking and cleaning
and shouting at
ooh  you get rowed too quickly you do 
I don't accept er fools gladly
I'm not a fool
its you who, who gets all up tight 
 
yes you did
that's what
well you get all aerated then, if things are not quite right, you ain't got much patience with some things 
I set up the and I like how its done
no you don't
until you come along and upset the apple cart
you just dream a lot 
you get some weird ideas about
 
no I don't  I know I'm not very mechanically minded, but
huh, you, you know how many 
I can fathom things out eventually 
you know that twice two are four, huh 
mm, you never listen to people and then you think  you can just pick it up by deduction
instead of just obeying instructions you just say well that should go that way and that should go that way and to me that's immaterial if you just see it going, see it, if its working that's it, know where the tops and bottoms of it all  I mean I see 
that won't that's obviously of won 
she, she was, no , I don't see why they had her on last night, terrible  I mean I couldn't even tell what
that er
that song, she or tune she was supposed to be singing 
you know in, erm 
phew
oh, er, oh John's Wood, you know that  film where the lad played er, sang didn't he?
where who sang?,
Al Jolsen with the boy?
in that film with Al Jolsen 
yes er , as boy
he had a boy on, it was boy on, on the front of 
well he was a boy 
the cinema
yes
well he lost his voice and he started whistling didn't he with his 
mm, mm 
with he, he, I mean he could of beat er, it, couldn't he?
well they must of had a profe really good whistling mustn't they but why they brought her on last night I think she was hopeless
that's what I mean if they'd had a good whistler he kept instead of her, couldn't he?
That man with that ten thousand table, apparently he said he use it nearly every day
yeah
he, it opened out
yeah
into a beautiful card table and, with the pockets
yeah
and er  he said he used it every day he said oh er, now I know the value I shall have to tell my bridge pals 
yeah, but that's what keeps 
not to put there glasses 
that's what keeps it why its kept so long then, then he said that 
then he said I shall have to tell my bridge pals not to mark the
yeah
because you know in the corners there were wood
yeah
wood, inlay wood things, you didn't see it, to put the glasses on or cups of coffee, he said I'll have to tell them not to put the glasses or cups on there
but er, any thing that's put in the spare room and left, that's when you get wood worm 
do you remember when you thought you'd got wood worm in our new table
and it was where they pinned the er, the, get the lips, the circle.
They even gamble, we were talking about and she says oh my wife knows all about that from where we come from, you know, live, live one like Random Street and which I suppose they had to get where they could, she come and looked at it and said oh that's one wear, said they're only four, four holes
they were pattern holes weren't they?
mm, but there was a bit er, you know where the legs moved?
mm
when it were made like the sawdust, some of that had got on our
and you thought that was them
that's what made me
you, you get to annoyed over trivial things, so I don't suppose you'll change at your age
probably not
drink that coffee, its gone cold.
when you think of this 
mind its not in the saucer you'll spill that down you 
when you think of these er music boxes like George's got and you see on telly
mm
but when it laying here and you look at this little box there, okay, with the real Doncaster
yeah oh yeah I see what you mean 
see what you mean 
yeah
they all sit round that Sunday afternoon wouldn't think it were
 
well it wasn't in those days  that were a good programme on, on Court today wasn't it?
yeah, do you wish you'd like it done now
no we wouldn't have it on today, we'll have it on tomorrow, see how it sounds 
I bet it don't work though 
mm
I bet it don't work
even when I'm doing the ironing tomorrow morning.
Say you're gonna have an early night?
mm
I don't think, you see, you see what that films out in't it?
mm we've watched it
oh, er, well it, well that was, but I mean that's not gone back right has it?
don't know 
you think it has, look you see there that's straight
mm, you probably bent it back when you fall, with all the pain and you, you ain't noticed it so much.
I know, I told him that was the only part that was hurting and he looked at it and said didn't 
alright 
say it was any thing to bother about
yeah, perhaps isn't, cos look at the pain in your frozen shoulder, its pain and yet its nothing broke is there?
no
disguise in't 
I suppose it will come right in the end  its taken a long while because look at that lump there 
mm, yeah 
look, can you see?
mm 
shall I have a new wedding ring?
of course you can if you want one, you'll have to ask about it do ya?trouble though a cartoon ring will do just as well 
you cheeky thing I've still got the other one, but it won't go on, but if I had erm 
well maybe they'll expand it 
no, if, what, where if you haven't got any gold?
well cut it through and open it and put a bit in 
oh no I didn't  
you've got plenty of old rings I can 
I haven't got plenty of old gold rings
well you've got some rings can cut a bit off and put in 
no  no I think I'll have a new one, that's got very thin
any way I've looked at them
how much are they?
dunno
how much was that?
what?
can you remember my wedding ring?
my that's going back in't it?
only thirty  thirty eight years nearly
the man was going for the engagement ring did do er high street 
no, yes well we had the wedding ring from there, he's closed down now
why come out I thought myself I'm trapped
did you now?
I'm trapped, huh, now I feel
 
I wished I'd never known that 
mind you I reckon my life would of been
well your mother was the wood there wasn't she really?
yeah, and when mother died what d'ya think my life would of been?
I dunno, can't see you getting on with Bill very much  much
well they were always against me, well Bill was during the war, what I'd done to them, finished all the decorating, put shelves up, go on the slate to put his aerial up, he wouldn't go up, I had to climb out my bedroom window onto the gutter and its a wonder I didn't kill myself then, put his aerial up and
what, did you get a big ladder?
no, I climbed out of 
oh 
my bedroom window
oh
you know your bedroom window where mine was 
yes I know, mm 
it was a yard at the back, but, I climbed out and stood on the sides
that was a silly thing to do 
and pulled myself over the gutter, it were alright getting up, it were getting back in
mm
and across the, er two yards the, a man and a woman were sit there watching me, hoping I'd fall I expect.
His aerial had come off the chimney
mm 
want any more coffee?
when I was going onto the roofing that was Saturday before the Monday, he says we should
in case I couldn't do the job
mm
that were a very good send off weren't it for me?
mm 
mind you there were times when were miles away we said er, we, we 
your sugar was all at the bottom of your cup then
I suppose it was, well I think
its er its only eight o'clock
yeah, but I get up at five
oh you're not going to bed yet 
well once in a blue moon do we have a late night?, not all that late at that 
yes, but when we see when we have
mm?
what do we look at when we have like a most nights  last I see that Argentina thing 
you was, Jackie and Tony came in 
mm
Jackie and Tony came round
but I mean, er last night
oh I see 
so I mean in particular its alright if there's a good film worth watching, for that I'd sit up till twelve 
yes, but you sleep you sleep through those mostly
sometimes
would you like a cam corder, or whatever they're called?
I don't, what for films?
like those video things 
I don't even know what they are here, let alone talk about it 
what, you did , you saw when we 
what they hold on the shoulders
yes, what erm
and they take pictures what, with 
what's er name's husband was carrying 
like the old er movie camera with Kodak?
yes, similar, er  you know next door to you, that girl
er wasn't that got that the 
she'd, the husband had got one 
Elsie had got, well that's 
Elsie 
that was a camera weren't it not a
it was a cam corder
oh it was moving 
yes it was a movie picture, yes been showing here, because  when she said she was blind, I thought well what's the good, but she said oh well, he, when he runs it through he sort of explains to, but he was using it all the time wasn't he?
mm  I thought you meant something like this
no
no
there about what's it  four or five hundred pounds
mm, I'd get two ladies for that
no you couldn't get two ladies, any way at your age what do you want a lady for?
well I don't know, but could do with it years ago 
well you should of had one
I mean that's why I'm left with the cash, two hundred cash 
no never thinks she'll thought any thing like that, well you could of bought one couldn't you out of that 
I know I probably could of had one right from the word go 
yes, but you're always on about it as if you wished you'd had a
 
well in the early days I only got er, what was, what was your, yours a quarter horse power motor wasn't it?
I dunno
oh one eighth horse power motor, well it drove that little lad, you know, that I, that, what I use now, but you see to have a big one
you wanted a bigger one?
wanted er like I've got, half horse
mm
well you see then I thought the electric running it you know 
well 
and, and er
you think too much
I thought well its
cos your drum of it instructor told you
eh?
years ago
can't have bloody 
I said you think 
can't bloody think er
no he was right  that's what I say you thinking about that thing, this isn't just doing it as it said, you ponder 
what might go wrong
no, on, on why should we be doing this way or that way instead of 
just pushing it in and hope for the best 
just pushing it in and and if it goes that's it, you, you want to question every thing
like we did last night
no we didn't
you're looking 
no 
better, do you feel better?, mm a nice pair of leg is it?
yes, I'm not too bad , no
sure just nice 
don't you ladder my stockings, your
what's this here, you've had a
I know that, that's why its been hurting at night
you've caught it on the er
 
er, no I don't mean that the stockings me tights 
that little 
no oh there 
squares you had a
oh yeah
hole there, or nail
oh, no wonder that's been hurting at night
its been, that has been blistering some time that, think its
have you been walked through the garden near the fire or any thing?
mm, might of done when I've gone to the dustbin
cos you haven't got any nails around there
mm I've caught, I might of caught it when I went to the dustbin
yeah
once or twice, or the barrel, and that's overflowing, you've not emptied it have you?
no, I was too busy ain't I?
no every time you go out to feed the birds you should take a bucket out
I could of finished that ship in the time we might of had 
oh no you couldn't you'd not been messing with that all that long 
poor old Cath, she, she doesn't know where she caught it, I bet she thinks she caught it her mother 
well you just catch these things , no she didn't got to Madge's when they got the
she did she went on talking through the letter box to them
not to Cath, no he went in the porch, he'd only go in the porch to Audrey and tell Audrey not to go in 
 
because Audrey cut his things easily, the cabinet went
no, its just in the air, I mean, if its going around you don't want to catch it, you catch it not going out any where, and the milkman probably, yeah 
and what your dad had set for, for all this and
he'd of liked the horse racing on T V
I bet he would, yeah and the cars.
and the car to take him around, well though he liked to walk in a way, when he was younger any way.
Didn't he lean on the window sills towards the end?
Yes he did
quite yours
well you do that's like your, I've seen your Bill he walks like your dad did
mm
when he was not still

who your Bill?
mm
well he probably has his er, he's got a 
married now 
his music thing hasn't he?, he likes music  he likes to be on his own  , ooh that nails sticking in  if you trim your nails properly
you tell mother when I were fighting for me country, he ain't got a bloody scratch on him  now 
do you hear me washer still going?
yes its just changed over and its started off
oh  I know when I've got a lots of, if I do one lot tonight
you'll get it all done  is it still raining?
mm, I shall er  get the other lot in and do that, do that first thing in the morning, get every thing cleared up, and then if you give me your pull overs, I can hand wash those and put them in the spin drier  so you'd better sort them out  do you think you'd of put some tassels in that pelmet?, you know where the I've got some spare one's no, don't you remember I went into and he gave me a piece of the trimming and I can take the tassels off
and stick
and push them through that loop, it looks 
oh bit 
a bit hard
bit of Araldite just on the end of the thread is 
no you don't I don't mean glue on
Araldite will stick any thing
did you hear Jackie had to send her new curtains back
mm, Tracy said
and she had them from May Porteswell.
I bet, I bet the plain poor people wanting them for Christmas wouldn't bother to send them, well she kept them for over Christmas.
Well it getting difference now here with most things, I mean now, er none of the shop keepers are sa , like they were very helpful in our day weren't they?
oh some of them are now
oh I expect there is, but not in general 
well I dunno, they ought to be even more now that fighting, er supposedly fighting for business 
yes you're not gonna tell me  er eighteen year old girl today compares with an eighteen year old girl in your mother's day
well, they wouldn't be making curtains, I don't think they could 
no I mean er they went, they did assist didn't ya in a shop
well some do today, er especially if they're on commission, perhaps they bother and try to sell you things you never really want 
I know that Iron mongers at er, near mo er Chequers Road, you know, where I used to go in and there were
down from the top of the steps to the path, just what I wanted
well that's a, that was a good little shop isn't it? oh I've been there lately 
it was, its still er 
yes you was
nobody went, dear old Maisie went to all that trouble
she's a very old
yeah what they do now if its, if its not within sight they say we haven't got any thing
no, well they come all in packets now don't they? you have to buy a packet 
yeah I suppose 
five, when you want six so you have to buy two packets
mm
that's a gimmick isn't it?

Aye but  well it's the right size  sort of thing it's, but it's er  to double up with the picture you can't do it.
So you've just got to draw natural?
Well, well  not being twice the size.
See twice the size, it wants twice  say the  it's nine inch and you want it twice the size  the canvas wants to be eighteen inch doesn't it?
Oh it's not that big is it?
You see?
And er  it's either, I think it's an inch and a quarter bigger than that.
So you've either gotta have a border and paint something in it or  you know?
So that's what I'm working out.
There'll be east top and bottom superfluous to the er what I'm painting.
Well you can put a bit more in can't you?
Oh yeah, of course, fill it in.
Don't have to be exact.
I think it's worth having a chicken for the soup do you?
Aye lovely.
Bring the dead to life.
Yet people have tinned soup don't they?
And these youngsters, what do they do, you know these young brides?
Packet soup.
Course some can cook.
A lot of them have these erm  deep freeze meals.
I never thought a lot to canteen meals.
Ours weren't bad.
That ti I was at er canteen at erm  and I took my plate, I was there thre two or three days and  she says you're the only one that's ever brought the plate back.
Perhaps they thought you wanted seconds.
Rice pudding do you want after that?
Mm.
Bit late today aren't we?
If you did it years ago they used to have a man in the lounge, only in the lounge
Oh  
you always paid a bit e extra and he'd er  fetch your glasses and bring another one.
Mm.
I think those days are gone.
And I, I, I di took it back once myself  and he says that's my job .
Ah!
Well there's not much on telly this afternoon is there?
No.
Nothing you fa there's plenty on but nothing 
Well that's 
you like.
No I'm going to rest after this meal.
Ooh I shall er do Countdown at four thirty.

Oh probably not.

Fed up with it?
Well no but  erm I've got on well, I've got the paper draughted fairly well and 
Jackie's back.
Mm.
Did you say somebody called but  perhaps they had a key though, I won't say anything to her, they might have had a key.
No.
A white van came, chap got out, you know, I never sh I di I didn't look to see if he come back.
Oh well  
But he, he, he, he, he'd gone shortly after.
Oh.
Whether he couldn't get it in I don't know.
She has been letting them in hasn't she?
Well leaving them a key or giving them the key to get in.
And it, now she's got to have the curtains replaced and I wondered if it was him who'd come
Mm.
and 
They don't have things on the van now do they?
Saying who they are.
Not all of them.
Still I got all the washing and ironing out of the way thank goodness, it's not bad now is it?
No.
Er  are you going to get the car out to get the wheely- bin out?
The morning isn't it?
Comes about seven.
Yeah  I, I shall be up.
Well you might not be.
You might  you might forget .
Shouldn't lay there too long.
Well it's up to you isn't it?
But they were there about seven the other week.
I know we're always up by then but  you never know, we might s be a bit late 
But it's always 
and not get up.
It's half 
it's always 
it's nearly full this week.
I was gonna say it's always half empty.
Ah no well it's nearly full, and there's that big carton in the shed to put in.
It's too big to keep isn't it, that big flat one.
That big oblong one, put that in it, get rid of that.
Well you do get  aeriated though when you're trying to do a new job don't you?
I don't suffer fools gladly 
I'm not a fool, it's you who's the fool .
The simplest little thing.
Do you want any more soup on there?
Yes but you won't be told, I mean
Oh!
to me, electric, the plus always goes to plus and the minus to minus, you can't mix them up.
Well I know you can't.
Do you want any more soup with that erm potato, those veg?
There's 
 
plenty left, well not plenty but there is some, do you want it?
No, the bit that's in the thing, there's plus and minus stamped but on the back there's  but you assume, you assume that there's 
well it's the other way round  well of course you do
Well
you turn it the other way round, everybody knows that.
You didn't, you were
Yes I did!
You wanted to put them upside down.
So I, when I proved to you it didn't work you were satisfied.
You were going with the picture on the outside, well that's fatal.
You wanna go plus and minus don't you?batteries, see if there's anything 
I don't know where I put them.
Was that anything?
No that's 
Yes I know.
Do you feel warm?
I do, I've just taken my jumper off, haven't you noticed it?
It's the soup making you warm, and the wine.
Mm can't eat 
Can't you  eat any more ?
Well I want 
Give it to the birds then.
I'm not going to have a sweet.
I think.
I'm gonna have a biscuit and cheese, just a little.
Come and have your pudding.
What do you think to the rice pud, is it  do you want any more milk on there?
Yes?
Mm?
The top's a bit hard, the crust.
Oh.
That's having dinner a bit later isn't it?
Well your jam's soft in the middle isn't it?
Have you done all your washing?
Yeah.
It's all up in the airing cupboard.
Oh no I don't  sit and think about it like you do with things.
Just get on with it.
There's nothing like forward planning.
Ooh   you're the least planner  I've ever known.
Or organizer should I say, you're the worst organizer  I've ever met.
Well let's hope you don't meet someone   
Have you got another bag of seed?
Have you found it?
No I had a look but erm 
I knew you hadn't got him one you would argue wouldn't you?
Think we'll get it, got it Friday, this Fri 
No you got one on Friday.
Couldn't carry two with not having the car.
And you reckoned then you'd already got one nearly full  
box are in the toilet with a paper bag in there's a, where I used to  put them and I've had a fair look but not sort of 
I don't er I know you haven't got another one, I remember you emptying the first bag.
That's weeks back.
And I haven't got any stashed away.
Well we shall have to get some then if, when it's propitious.
You don't want to go this afternoon do you?
Not particularly.
Anyway you can't go in the car cos you've had some drink.
Go first thing in the morning.
P pigeons have been dying, not,no the one up on the top.
Well you don't want them to come if you've got no seed for them do you?
No.
Well there's all that stuff up  meat and bread, one of them's gone there now look 
Have they cleared that chicken off the roundabout?
I haven't been up there.
Didn't you look?
Oh I 
No.
thought you went over there.
Thought you weren't putting any more cos of the cats.
Well if you go and pick the bones up.
You know, they were all round it just before, while you were drawing.
I'll go up and pick the bones up and it'll be alright.
Ooh I'm going to go and have a shower and a change  and go in 
 
the other room and have a rest.
eight hours sleep I should think.
Why did I keep you awake last night?
No, no.
Light.
Well I didn't sleep very well again.
Do you want a bit of this cheese, it's lovely?
No not really a cheese man.
I don't mind a bit on a biscuit on occasion but
Oh I thought you used to love cheese.
I used to like that Canadian red.
Well this is.
No this is Canadian white.
working on the stage musicals then weren't er  if you'd not had your tea and you brought something  the commissar would eat them.
Did you see that Joseph and His
Many Colours?
It's m m making a big hit again in London.
Well it is a good show isn't it?
Mm well it m ma er m made a big hit here didn't it?
Mm.
Well I suppose  it's good for children anyway.
Well you see they've been brainwashed to that sort of music so they're bound to, bound to like it.
I know but it's not all that sort it's erm  I mean you enjoyed it 
 
and you don't normally like pop do you?
Say the children that  when that, we saw it  now what would they be, fourteen, fifteen?
No.
They've bound to go for it aren't they at that age.
They only like to listen to rubbish.
No they don't.
Why people spend good money to go and listen to that sort of stuff I'll never know.
Not the co Dream Coat, that's alright.
No, no 
You liked it when you went to see it.
Yeah but you can't beat it with er  can you?
With who?
 
!
Er nice er and that one we listened to this morning, the  dance.
Lovely, you could listen to that  three hours at a time.
Well some folk music you can can't you, that's what it's  for.
Well and what do you reckon those are, now all those, would they have  pop music?
Well times were different weren't they.
We lived in a gentler age.
Oh some, I have a   sort of fee 
finish that pudding.
I have a quiet feeling that this no reading and no a add up and all that stuff co co stems from the music they're always listening to.
No it's not, it's the teachers.
They walk by with headphones on don't they?
I know.
No a lot of it's these young teachers.
And probably the training colleges.
yes but teachers are like them aren't they?
They dress like, they dress 
Well that's what I, that's what I mean.
like them.
Remember our teachers?
Yeah.
A dark suit and moustache.
Any more?
Any more wine?
No thanks.
And a severe 
I'm going to have to clear up and go in the other room.
a severe expression and it wasn't put on.
It was built in.
We had screens on wheels in latter years at, last few years at school and er  he used to go down to the tea room for a cup of tea half way down the stairs, the teachers' room and perhaps go toilet as well, and er  the one at the back was a foot out from the screen and every now and then he'd have a look to see if he was coming and er we, what had  had a big case with birds in and the lads who were doing it looked in this, saw the reflection and shh he's coming.
So er er after a bit you see he changed them round, he, he guessed somebody were  and of course I got the job 
I'm glad I'm getting rid of all the Christmas remnants.
I've only got one round case and about two vol au vents
I forgot about that.
so
Still you said you want it running d ?
Yes that's  
understand what you're 
Well I'm just getting it on the 
Well   Now have ten minutes with your feet up before you change.
Did you know?
What?
You dozed for about three quarters of an hour.
What ?
This afternoon  just after 
What were the birds doing?
Well they cleared all that chicken now I've picked all the bo 
with all this 
  

with all this  you arguing and telling me I'm wrong when I'm right and right when I'm wrong.
No I'm not!
In fact I felt tired and when I went to change I er
Went on the bed.
No I felt like going on.
Oh if you'd shouted down I'd've g come with you.
Oh no you wouldn't.
No I didn't but I just changed and came down here and put my feet up here.
Yeah we're getting on now so 
I keep going cold.
Somebody said in the paper shop that  looking for the papers er I thought, I couldn't see any, I was starting to walk out I said have you finished with the papers, said no there they are in that cabinet
Oh they're always changing the position.
Yeah, some old girl in there  I said you get like that at eighty two, she said you're never eighty two I said I am, she said well you look well on it.
I said yes I can rise to the occasion as well.
Well that's a silly remark to make.
Well I can rise to any occasion
Pardon?
woodwork, windows, anything.
Do you want a chocolate biscuit?
No, full up   
Such as?
have to burn it up when you're   Feels as if only just gone.
Well you know all the chicken bones?
Mm I see they cleared it out.
They clean oh, oh I've put all the bones in the er dustbin.
I see they cleared it all up.
And I didn't cut, you know I didn't cut it up, I just left it.
About another three weeks we should be out of the real winter shan't we?
Should be.
Although March can be  pretty cold.
February.
February's usually the worst.
February you get wet snow and rain.
Mm.
Mind you don't burn that ch table.
Well you pushed the table nearer the fire.
It was, you left the back door open that's what's made it, the room cold.
How was your tea?
Very nice.
tea now.
Nothing to watch is there?
Well yes Some Mothers Do Have Them about seven thirty.
Yeah.
I'm going to have Countdown, I'm going to do Countdown.
Yeah.
Ke keeps your brain active.
We've got enough active there.
Keeps your brain active.
Yeah well  use it on there then.
By the way is it er
It's still recording I think.
Might as well use this tape up and  
Do you think I ought to finish the ship first of all or do the oil painting?
Well if you've got to go in the garage, it's too cold to go in there to finish the ship off so you'd better paint in the house hadn't you?
Well if I want to turn something  I've gotta keep walking in and out and I don't wanna do that.
Well then leave that till warmer weather.
It's not ready for rigging yet is it?
Will you take that to Tom's or not?
Who?
Your Tom.
If we go tomorrow, yes.
We might as well use a tape up.
Do a pennorth do a pennorth of it can't you?
Perhaps Maggie's got some bright ideas of
I doubt it.
Cath I know who could fill it up, Cath.
Cath .
Well we've got to go round there if we're out to  because erm we've still got Penny's  
Well it'd show willing if we did get a bit of all on wouldn't it?
A few more.
I mean if, if they had,ha had nursery rhymes.
No don't be silly  they just want vocabulary, they don't want things like that, they want to know  a person's vocabulary a to cer you know, at a certain age.
I think the not doing very well with some sixteen year olds.
No!
Tim's got that lady friend.
I know he w she were on about a room weren't she?
No!
Why would Tim want to come and live here?
I didn't say he would but Cath might want him to.
No course she wouldn't!
Anyway Tim's paying a lot towards that house.
Mm.
You know he paid for it to be 
Well that  very much when you live there does it?
Well
Look what we pay  
 
Look what we
And then the double glazing cost over a thousand.
Mm.
Glad we didn't have it then.
Well it is about, about a thousand for one bay window so she's had the whole house done  so it's probably nearer three.
But can you honestly say you've been cold in this house?
No.
I've been in digs 
Well where lots of people  
I've been in digs where you went to bed and you've had to put your top coat on the bed.
Mm.
There are lots of people let the windows go and it was a case of either having new wood windows
Yeah or get glazed.
or, or paying the bit extra and have it double glazed.
Yes but you can't open your windows in the summer.
Well you can with double glazing, some  
 
but you can have vents.
But while our wood frames are in condition
Yeah what sort of problem is it when you, say a kid broke the window like they broke ours, what sort of problem is it as opposed to these?
Well you get it done on the insurance, your insurance covers that.
I don't mean that I mean it w is it a bigger job or s 
Well of course it would be.
Well then.
That, you take that into consideration an'all.
If you get it done on the insurance I don't suppose people worry.
There's always a debit side.
Anyway it's always  er  they're tougher than ordinary glass anyway, even if footballs do
Mm.
It's not footballs is it, it was er
Well stones or whatever.
it was a stone or half a brick.
Or even somebody who went berserk with a hammer, that's been known.
Oh yeah I know.
One thing they seem to be giving the skateboards a rest aren't they?
Mm.
I mean how wh er how the parents can let them
Yes, yes but, but it's not the time 
come down three abreast I don't know.
of year for skateboards so you, that's no criteria is it?
No but why, how parents can let 
Yeah.
let them come down three abreast
Mm.
and say that they've got, have every right to do it.
Well
Well you wouldn't say that if you got knocked down and broke your thigh would you?
Look at your dad, he died in three days.
No he didn't.
Three weeks.
Well  three something or other.
Then there was your Aunt Nell, she, she broke her 
   
Mm?
What'd you say?
   

I think it's a silly thing anyway  sit o lay on that with your nose er two inches from the pavement
Well  kids have different games don't they from  
That's not games it's annoyance, it's just
I'll get it.
You go and get it.
It's annoyance value.
No I don't want any more.
that's what they do it for.
You go and get yourself another cup of tea then.
Before it gets cold.
Have you got some slippers?
Oh yes.
Look when they kicked the ball at , they could quite as easily kicked it at tree.
Mm aye.
Find me a bit of 
You know if they wan wanted to rebound it.
scrap paper while you're out there.
Do they hurt?
They look a bit tight across  
No slight they're very soft com 
I know they're soft for the bedroom, take your cup!
I don't want any more, I've just had a chocolate and that's made me sick.
They're a bit sickly aren't they those chocolate w Don't you think so?
Yeah they're a bit too much 
 
a bit too much int they?
I like, you know the old fashioned Fry's Cream, well Cadbury's used to make one like it only different coloured creams
Mm
and they were lovely.
Well I think we've only got one box of chocolates left.
The rest are chocolate biscuits.
Oh.
I like Cadbury's creams  
Well you can't get Cadbury's cream chocolates now so stop harping.
   

Well there isn't anything for them if they hadn't gone.
Well it's not damaged the  has it?
No I, I  dead-headed them today, you were going to do it yesterday but you didn't.
So when I went to shut that gate after that 
They  themselves now.
No they don't, they just die then  
Well I've seen them on the  l lawn so that 
Well it's where I've
Yeah it's like the wind and 
clipped them off and the wind's blown the flowers from the corner.
Wh when I went to shut the gate after that man had left it open I er I went round and dead-headed them all.
I can't understand tradesmen, they come hoping for business
And leave your gate open .
and leave your gate wide open for the dogs to come in and, and tear your 
Plants.
plants up.
Hmm.
But I mean i it's beyond belief innit?
If I wanted somebody to  buy what I'd got I'd be scrupulous about that, wouldn't you?
Well it's the people they employ, probably, not the people who are  who er 
Do you, do you think
want the business.
well if it's er if it's kids say, you know, youths  do they leave their own father's gate open like 
They probably haven't got any.
I mean really when you look round here most people have taken the gates off haven't they?
Yes.
Oh w oh w er have to, up the top, you know those two  she said why don't you take your gates off like us, I said why should I?
I said what do you have gates for if not to close them?
No point having a gate is there if you don't close it?
Well they do it because they're lazy.
They want to put their car, put, they want to drive 
No 
straight in with their cars.
it's deeper than that, they don't like what they see.
If they don't like what they see they spoil it.
Watch the children today.
And they'll get worse.
Is that somebody's alarm ringing?
It's a bit wet isn't it?
No.
No it's a bell.
You listen, you go to the front and listen.
There's er there's er somebody's alarm ringing across the road.
No nothing out there.
There is, I, I think it's two doors up 
No.
where they had the burglaries.
Could be a gas van.
Oh they're all lit up across their car.
Yeah they do that now.
Put their lights on early.
 
No they keep open till eight.
You go to the front door.
 
You go to the front door but it's probably  next door but one the alarm went, go to the front door.
It's not the fire.
Yeah but listen.

The birds are all gone.
loading stuff on something.
Well I've made a start in my painting it's

Well I ain't going out on that  Fox again.
Well we'll go on the corporation buses.
You were alright on the  Fox on Friday.
I mean when they're full I've noticed when,we they were standing in the gangway.
We were the only two on Friday coming back from town.
Oh I know,w when we were going we, I stood in the gangway alongside you and I could see, as they were swaying, people were  pushing onto other people who were sitting down.
Hmm!
Well you don't want that do you?
Well we'll go on the corporation, wait for a corporation  you wouldn't wait for a corporation, I said wait, wait for the big bus.
I mean if we go, we're sitting on the outside and invariably they're a bit over into the gangway  well if a chap kept pushing against us as the car went round corners  it wouldn't be very nice would it?
Some might like it, some might object.
Well they wouldn't get on again if they objected would they?
But I mean it could've been made a bit bigger than that couldn't it, for the seat  
Well the new ones are a bit bigger.
And there's nowhere to put your parcels, like you with 
There is, the front seats.
you with a broken arm.
Well there is the fr a front

And then there's  there's dog dirt on the wheels and that goes on the, in th then that's 
Oh don't be so 
transferred to your  shopping.
 
Your shopping's transferred it to the pantry.
Oh shut up!
You go to the pantry, get on your hands  then you take it into the dining room   
It's not, it's a good game.
It's alright for children.
It's alright for children.
No!
Grown ups do it!
Yeah, think you  
It, it keeps your brain a bit active, you learn new words.
Martin's always said I've got a too active brain many's the time.
Well you've got too thinking a brain now  some things.
How was our Cath?
You didn't put the kettle on did you?
No
You haven't left the kettle on, that's not whistling, no.

Lock the back door.
Arthur?
Tt have you locked the back door?
Eh?
Have you locked the back door ?
Yes.
Oh.

Ooh dear    Well do it on the canvas, after all that was
What it was for.

When will you start painting?
Oh I do feel weary, I hope I'm not going to have the flu.
Well I felt, that's how I felt  and you said

I felt weary this afternoon 
You know what it is, it's the worry of that.
No it isn't!

I had a bad night last night.
It's bound to take it out of you.
Countdown was quite good today.
Arthur?
Oh aye?
Er Carole Vorderman, she's not getting a chance to  do the figures.
I, I think everybody's catching up to her methods like I am.
So she got two, two words better than
Yeah mm.
either the contestants or the er dictionary judges.
So  she scored on that line.
I think we'll look at the news in a few minutes to see what the weather's going to be  and then, do you want any ice cream or anything?
Or a drink?
No I  
Just get a, are you ready for an ice cream or later?
Later?
What about holidays?
Yes but  this time we usually book that April holiday about January.
I know but in April you've got to take a chance.
I could do with one now I think.
Are you coming to look at the news?
No.
We saw that Jack the Ripper didn't we?
Yeah it's been on so many times.
Yes it was on Sky last year.
So the only thing
And it's not as good as the real story.
No.
So the only thing er we're interested in is in er  Some Mothers Do Have Them, seven thirty.
Oh er yeah and 
And the Falklands on Four.
and well and there's mink a a about those 
Ooh I don't want to see that thing.
Yes i i ke f er

Eight thirty.
I don't like to see those er mink  
Well it's life innit?
I know but erm
You'd like mink if somebody gave it to you.
I shouldn't, not these days.
I rather think that's a, a repeat, I seem to re remember seeing it because er didn't a lot of them escape and they've 
Mm.
sort of bred all over the country?
Over the country.
Well I'll perhaps go and have a bath then.
Have you had a shave yet?
No.
You know what Mr  said.

No remind me to get some jars.
Have you seen Forg Fergie 
Yes, I don't think she looks nice like that.
She looks thinner though.
Oh she's a lot thinner but  She's smoking to get thin.
I think that's what Cathy used to do  cos she used to get tubby, hasn't she?
Mm.
And then she'd suddenly go thinner and I'm sure it was when she started smoking again.
Have you looked in the garage for your slippers?
No they, they must be there, I w I know I went in there.
Well are you ready for your ice cream now?
Went in to look for the seeds so I m I might have changed, just gone , I dunno.

Mm.
think it might lead to a, an epidemic, mm.
Well,s I thought it was tending that way.
No this is a stronger strain apparently and er they're a bit worried.
I don't think I've ever had the real flu.
I think you did years ago, that time, the only once  you had the doctor.
Oh bad though wasn't it?
Mm
I had a fortnight of it didn't I?
Yeah.
Ma Madge said she had the real flu because she ached all over and  really weak.
But I've never had it  like that, it's, touch wood I never do.

I wonder how he 
What's for breakfast?
I dunno, what you want poached egg or egg and bacon?

When he came home he was messing about on pavement for quite a while, I was, I thought somebody was trying to get in, you know
mm
I stood and watched for a minute or two 
well his dustbin wasn't there cos the little lad took it in yesterday 
mm 
perhaps he was just admiring his new car
mm, possibly 
unless he was looking around and see if it had been bumped in the night
mm  he'd not put it on the drive this time
didn't he?, perhaps he's going to take his wife to work
mm, mm 
perhaps waiting for all the kids to school first  perhaps can't see to do it in the dark
mm

just the, so we can put the new filter in, only they  fret wants cleaning, I can do that, if you'll get up and undo it for me 
I think I, get up and go the thing
go where?, huh  I, I had an awful night again, I didn't get to sleep till about one or two, I'm not going to go to bed early again
what didn't you have?

I don't know, you were up at six, just after.
Just that shoulder still hurt? keep rubbing it 
mm, just I just rub it down and to keep it moving    another salt for a week or two in it, the icy roads, bound to put salt down aren't they?
no, you get obsessed with that
that cow I'll run down the stairs quick enough when the signal comes, salter's away  seemed to love throwing it out don't they?.
Er what made me smile when they found out that the salt were going through these er motorway bridges and attacking the steel work in the concrete  with all sort of powers that they would of known that wouldn't ya?
mm  
damage it must do over the country

I think this time of the year the mornings seem to get darker
I want some sort of phraseology that as the nights get lighter the mornings get dark

porridge and I
it was all greasy
 
well that was the milk

try 
nothing else

well, oh you're supposed to have four cups  I'll er  I'll use it one day and not tell you and see if you can tell the difference shall I?
Those bricks of
seemed to be holding them from better place from the springs we couldn't find aren't they?
what the 
you know I used to sort of bellow out 
bellow out yes, well the, the wind, the wind, the hand will blow the light springs up eventually  perhaps I'll put, when I've made some true er, perhaps I would put six inch pieces in instead of any
oh it's alright, er I thought this was a nice bottle, but it's a foil bag, look
mm
that's it, they say in, you know what they've done, they've left the gate wide open again
oh did they?
I'll have, I'll have to go out and shut it
they wonder why you don't want to buy, in the, they must see the flowers there mustn't they?
yes  another cleaning offer, half price  should we have these carpets cleaned?
mm?, no 
they'll be back where they was weren't they?
yes 
you rubbing round and in case under all the furniture we don't tread 
oh another offer, hand cream, Neutragone, Neutragena  don't give you much as a sample, oh highly concentrated 
 

two to three applications
there's black
on the railings look 
gone, now, see
I don't know how you can see with that curtains pulled like that, why's it, shall I pull it back?
eh?
what's the mat , look I've just trod on two grapes there
oh sor 
that's why I say we want the carpets cleaning 
It's you know, what you used to like 
That's it you can spitting your grape pips on the top if I'd er been, I've picked up  
yeah, they fell out me they probably fell out me hand
oh yes that's a good excuse  is it alright?
what?
your paint a graph, is it working?
well it's, well I'll fix it 
or haven't you finished it off yet
no, I'm finishing off the bits that are left 
mm, like every thing else  you told me you'd finished it the other day
well I have, I'm making adjustments, what I mean, what I'd finished it, I didn't bother to try it cos it didn't work, now I found out why it don't work  I have to change the rod, I've got the rod in the wrong place
mm
so I had to go and put a thread on  and put it in, it in another place
use your glasses, do you want another drink?
oh yeah keep coming
no you're not having too much
why?
well, I don't know whether that man over there is cleaning the windows or whether he's having to look at the double glazing again
probably burglars 
well, he was there yesterday, apparently he's must have a complaint on the double glazing  wouldn't be cleaning windows two days would he?
wouldn't of thought so, it's near enough dry, now
do you want it hot or, or with dry ginger?
er dry ginger would be nice
oh you can have it hot
dry ginger, yes
well I'll give you dry ginger this time.
Flap jacks don't appear to be cooked and yet they've been in the time they should have, I don't know what's happened, there you are there's your drink  don't knock it over
no
put it that side 
so where is your
oh I'll get it, it's all mucked up in it, gotta clean the shed next thing 
I thought you always kept it in here  oh
yeah, but
mm?
don't get enough heat from there 
it says leave it for ten minutes so I expect it er hardens now
What do you think to the pudding?
What?
Would you sooner of had a pie?
oh no I like pudding, pie it's a bit dry in it?
not really, always have more gravy, didn't, I didn't think the meat was as good, you didn't either and I went to another butcher because I thought it 
you had to break it to bits to eat it
no you didn't, shin of beef is like that, but
too much shin on it
don't be silly, no I thought it looked better at this other bit, this butcher's, it looked leaner, but erm  it wasn't perhaps, perhaps I didn't cook it enough yesterday, drink your drink
yeah 
but I've got some left of that beef, so
throw it away then
I'm not going to throw it away, it's too expensive to throw away, no I'll cook it a bit more and do a  do a curry, rice  or spaghetti
make a meat pie and take it to Cath's
why should I take it to Cath's?
that was when I burnt my arm 
come on and put your feet up you've done enough
I'm gonna put me feet up for a few minutes, do you want now we've nearly finished?
mm?
I say I'll put me feet up before we wash up
I'll wash up you sit there 
no you needn't 
have the birds gone?
yes, twenty four pigeons it's too many 
out there?
no  no the starlings seem to be pecking away at the top  slabs are getting dry so I don't know, er you see that man's still up there, I wonder what he's doing up there at the side 
has he got a ladder?
well he wouldn't, don't take all that long to put guttering up does it?unless he's pointing the bricks up, he was there all day yesterday 
perhaps the  
oh I see what you mean 
any way that's his problem
oh I, yeah
mm
are you going to do any drawing or painting?, are you fed up with it?
no, it's I'll go
rest
and get on with me, you know the board I made?
yes
behind the drawing pins
mm
this, this little board there's no room to work here
oh that's why you bought the big board
yeah I know, but I 
you know where your drawing pins are?
I tried it but the paper was stuck down, stuck down already 
look there's the drawing pins
mm leave them there though
out, in this cupboard?
mm 
I should like something nice to finish off with
take your skirt of then
don't be silly
mm, ain't that nice?
no
I thought it was
do you want half this orange?
I'll have a bit then if you're not gonna eat it 
cos the big ones are too big, big aren't they these are 
how is it that we forbid
how is it that were still 
I've only just put it on
oh  are they different oranges?
no they're Morroc but they're 
they are 
but they're a bigger size and thicker skinned, I'd sooner have the smaller ones
you don't see blood oranges now do ya?
you do sometimes  these are the best Morroc's, but, same, the stall I go to doesn't stand on Tuesdays  only Wednesdays and Fridays and Saturdays, here are 
don't get juice all over it
I shan't get juice all over every where, it'll be you.
Well Made your Barbara's on at two o'clock, are you going to see that?
mm, I might as well 
you've got to be quick though
what time now?
it's nearly that now, are you going to change
mm
mm?, you better, they're your old trousers aren't they?,
I mean 
well with Clare and
 

look at all the pigeons again  do you want to have a bit more?, nice aren't they?, sit up, sit up  these are juicy aren't they?must still be very cold outside, can you see the steam from the boiler?
mm  where was that fog on freezing roads?
I'm glad we've got the cooker hood done, you can see all that black
mm
can't never that filter to be like that have you?
ah, I've put you a three eight, wide eight thick piece of steel lay it on the top that would hold it down in the middle 
well those hack saw blades do, don't they?
mm, just hold it down and
I mean I think so 
that spring didn't work the one we had did it? cos it 
I think those springs are, are dangerous, they shoot up and down on 
came flying out when out in't it, when we put it in?
mm 
now we know 
I mean 
it won't fly out when it's inside
that's what I mean, as you were putting it in it, it shot out didn't it?
mm
last time.
Not much on these potatoes
I've not had any today, just had one little bit, do, do you like 'em?
one thin strip of metal edge ways on across the centre I'd do it won't it?, that thing
would it?
well you've got all the size pattern down
well your the expert
in that across 
well that, that spring you got was too thick
mm
too wide, wasn't it?, it was wider than the, the thing itself, so you want, it's got to be cut down width wise 
you know how according to the thick, the.. bull clip last time, you had a lot of cause didn't ya?
ah but on, you know the new diagram, the new packet, the springs went like dia er
diamond
half a diamond shape
yeah what you really want is a
and on one side and yet inside the instructions it gave, you know
mm
two curves
yes well I've been thinking about it, what you want is a 
well we paid about three pounds for those springs
springs?
mm
when do you ever buy
when we bought them, when we had the first lot of springs 
oh I we haven't got them now that's before
you must have, must be in me diary
well any way look, if I made you a thin bit of steel straight across the centre like that
yes, that would
it's thicker than hack saw blade, perhaps a bit heavier
mm
straight across and then put a cross on the other way that's all you want
mm
like that
mm, I know
like hack, hack saw blades sort of thing
mm
edge ways on
mm
not flat because you stop the air from, to that simple enough
where you going to get the spring from?
steel
mm
oh I've got a load of that back of the car 
Is this too hot with the fire on?
no I'm alright 
is that the boiler making that noise?
yeah
seems to be louder than usual, don't it?
or it's your fan
I thought I'd turn the fan on
your fan?
I know I thought I'd turned it off, I'm going to have a look, something seems to be making a noise  it was the vent
 
yeah, yeah 
I'd put that on as well as the other fan 
as the fan , the fats congealed with the frost
what on the
you know in the opening and 
mm 
the fans are catching it.
How, what's the time now?
nearly five too, five too 
oh 
stop moaning, you know what you didn't have
that there
your medicine before your meal, that medicine you're supposed to take before for your chest
that's alright now, it's not er, it must of been er congealed in the night in the chest.
Tis now
she won't agree
yeah
I the, the disturbed at the way the English lads are speaking
ooh without a doubt
in a way they find out 
no I think that it's to get the vocabulary various classes of people and varies age group 
yeah, but as Les says there's more in it than that
there's a, there's of course the entire speaking
is getting very bad now in't it
yes
I brought those all Arthur, erm
it's gotta be like that is it?
they're the things that's got to fit in, no they're not 
and now I think, do they just clip on? they just clip on?
yes they well, er see that step only there's erm 
yes I'll just have to stand up 
I reckon there's another one the other side, perhaps that they 
yes 
only just drop on like that don't they?
yes and then the piece sticks out where you just er, where it goes on
yeah
so I don't how'll you, how will you do it?, will you be alright to do it?
yeah, is it, is this one alright is it, is it only the one broken or two 
no there's two, they're the two pins
they're, these are all the bits
yes 
well there's only, only enough bit then for  I don't
yes
that's why I shall come up and have a look at 
are yours 
don't know 
that stuff what's clipped on yours, with your pin?
no I'll show you in a minute, no
or are they just er
here you are lets take these
what I think Les, I think you should have two walls, I don't know, I think you should have two walls, one either side
yes ther ,ther ,there 
then and that 
them split at the end
yes
where it's on
er, right
see it's split
mind that might be hot
ooh
don't put it on the carpet if it's hot 
there it is look
no that
see that spark 
don't want sewing up?
yes
see were on a bit of a
yes, I move that metal, that comes out and it's split
yeah, well what 
is yours split there?
no well what 
don't stand on it
what I think is this
oh I see, yes, I see
hold on a minute Les lets turn these off
mind, your going to spray
lets move it away
underneath in't it?
oh we've got one of them, light bulbs
oh things come out
to be replaced, look one of 'ems gone, that's why it's dark 
er, used to, any way, that wants seeing, er I reckon you should have, see that lip
yes
I reckon you should have another lip and it fits that slide on like that
yes
so you'll, I shall have to make one 
yes  I wonder if er if you got two bits of thin tin you know
yeah, well I and er
make you
and er
it just slides on I think
lower that and, and you peg stones up like that
that's right, yes
see you can't go out cos that's er, and er just pushes on I think
yes cos the, cos, cos where's, yeah 
you see it's very fragile got a 
where it's come off
mm
it's, it's parted, the, the, the, the metal fang comes along and then when it gets to the end ere it's split, it's split
I you know what that's for, for the spring, it's split like that in't it?
what?, yeah
it's split like that
yes, yes, the metal yes and it 
which is 
clips on there I think
well, yeah you open that out to make it tight
oh I, to fasten it on
yeah
I see
you see you get, over the years it probably expands and it
yes
becomes loose
ah
so you open that a bit 
yes
that spring 
which is that yeah, I
and then 
alright then 
you'll have to push it on
I got it, yes
any way I'll make summat to do it
right, thank you, you've got the two pins have ya?
yeah, yeah 
Arthur
Better find a little dish to put them on so you don't wa 
well I've got plenty
loose them, let me get a dish
I've got plenty of drivers like this
have ya?
yeah
here's one here and you've got the other one ain't ya?
used to drive erm our machine used to drive
did they?
what we call drivers
yes
about two inch long, you know
yeah
and er, they are very fragile
yeah
they've made it so as it, it do , you see I, I, I reckon you ought to open my let me make them in te in steel because er they made them like that so that when you pull them off or adjust them
yes
they won't burn ya
no  yes
I mean they're like er ha hard plastic
it is in't it, yes it's like it
what are ours?
er well metal you see there look
yeah 
well you don't, you don't have to make it in plastic do you?
well it does it, its method is to shove them on
oh
er in or out according to where he wants them to flicker, well you see, as it, as the wearing get hot, that plastic expands and become loose and he's got a, a split, see that steel thing
mm
ours is like that solid, well his is split, the idea that is you opened it like that, so when you push your others on, it has to compress it and it holds, but over the years it's er  the body 
weaked 
the body 
yeah 
yeah 
er, er, I can make you one in plastic 
what  
but er
oh what, oh, I dunno know, er
mm, have you had it a few years?
ooh yeah about, two the same, one in the lounge and one in the in the dining room one's got the convector on 
it depends don't it?
the top
mm
and the two bars and the other one's got the two bars
mm
yeah, they're very good and er, funny that, one in each has gone
oh, oh it's 
you see not the two, yes, so we've still got one lighting on each 
my tubes have gone, one out of each pack oh I see you've got one, one er, er out of each room
that's right yes  yeah  yes
I just remembered one of these lights went last night 
did they?
I forgot to remind Arthur to er
yes
to replace it
yeah  yeah 
get that one down
yes without go coming up to say and I presume it's like this, you perhaps told, when I draw it
don't draw on that table too much, you'll mark the table 
now that's your piece still I assume
yes coming that way
that way
yes
now this, this is the matter, now you your other bit, I don't think your gonna see it mate
put that other lamp on Arthur
yeah
so you can see
yes 
is Eadie resting?
yes, yes, she'll just have an or orange when I came out , she's been, I've been getting a few of those, it seems to help a bit 
mm, I always eat plenty of fruit 
yes, yeah 
Arthur does grapes
does he?
mm, he loves grapes and apples
er
we couldn't bring any apples though yesterday, not taking me car with
ah carrying, yes 
we get er 
how's the arm going Evelyn?
well it's, it's still swollen
yeah
oh her tempers getting the same Les
yeah, yeah, yeah 
but, er I can turn taps and hold things a little bit more 
can you, yes I well it's gonna take time for that 
not, not all that 
to go down, in't it?
as you, you know how you sort of hold want to 
yes 
hold things in your left hand
yes
er, it's still not very strong
is it?
no
mm 
but the swellings gone down mostly I've got gloves 
ooh it is, it's a lot better, yes quite a while 
on for the first time yesterday
Christmas, yes yeah 
so 
yes 
I think I'll go
you can't draw it in yellow cos it don't er take on this so I'm going 
you don't have to draw it in yellow
no, no I'll be alright now 
if you do them both white it looks all wrong
yeah
but you've got different colour pencils 
now this green is your, your yellow
yes 
er there's a slit there ain't there like that?, keep this still
yes, that's right, it's open, yeah
well
oh that's how, how it works
now that's, that's the wall of your yellows 
yes 
broken
that's right
and that's the other wall which you need to go 
yes, as far as I can see with the other one's 
yeah
still on yes 
yeah , they now, looking at end ways, it's like this  in't it?
yes
that's your, your yellow plastic
that's right it's just on the end 
that's it now here's your steel bit that's split
yes
like that
yes
so if you open that er steel bit
yes 
wide like that
yes
wider than what it is
yes
it grips when you push it on
that's right
and the idea that is, is I see it
yeah
is you want 
so they will slot it won't they?
yeah as I, no, no not the yellow, the, the metals slot in
yes
and the idea is so you, you push it down to earth, you want it down to there
in other words you can move it up and down aargh
and I reckon that's it, that's broke on your movement you see
yes
it's, these walls have broken off there
mm 
see those two walls
yes
and that's the bottom bit, and that, that there's your steel inside 
yes that's right
but these have broken off and of course it's dropped off
I
so what I'll shall have to make you is a, you can either have it in metal, or in plastic
whatever is, is, is easiest for you Arthur you're doing 
well I think it's both easy, but er
yeah
there, it's done with plastic so it don't get red hot when you, when you adjust it
yes
but then again you'd be a bit daft 
don't suppose you adjust it very often do ya?
no, but you'll be a bit 
never touched it I haven't
no
you'll be a bit daft to adjust it when it was hot wouldn't ya?
mm, yeah
yes, but I've never touched them er
 
if it was mine I'd er, I'd er 
I've took these off to, to put the bulbs in
mm
for my money I'd have it with all metal
yes
but that's the i you see the idea of it now can't ya?
yes, yes
your yellow bits slides along here to where they were, here's your, here's your point
yeah
you can have it there, you can have it there, you can have it there 
ah, ah 
by pushing it up and down
yes
and this gets very hot, well fairly hot
yes
and the plastic soft and broke 
yes I think what I can see of er of what's on the other one on each fire
yeah
er there right on the end
mm oh I see 
there right to the end 
oh Arthur's all, always messing about with ours
is he?
to sort of make them go round
ah
you know unless there's a draft
yes
they won't always flicker do they?
no, no , no
he likes fiddling about 
yeah
I've made ours go right and left we've got two 
yeah I've never touched ours much at all 
well he's only got on , there's one out of each fire
oh, we've got two and er
well so has Les got two
on the same fire?
yes
but there's one alright and one broken 
there's four altogether 
yeah, but, oh four well I'd like to 
yeah of course, yeah
you, you see those wings that are going round there 
yes, yes 
he's got two fires
these
yes
I turn 'em what that, that way
yeah
and this one that way
yeah
so that one goes to the right and this one goes to the left
ah, ha, ha I've nothing, never, yeah 
he, he fiddles about with he likes fiddling
he did tell me though about doing the old pencil in, in here in't it?
yes 
in here Arthur ain't it?
or graphite
or a bit of graphite, yeah
you put the in there, in there do ya?
just put your 
in there?
pencil, just put your pencil in and along there 
yeah and roll it round I
yeah, now here's your, there's your peg look your pointer, now draw it in black, you can see it better, there's your pointer, now draw it out here, the bit you brought your, your yellow bit is like that
yes 
and if you, if I make in steel and then can drive in and fit your pin
yes
you'd have this effect, see  there's your wall  and the, that  then you pin up the middle like that
ah, yes
you see, but now that, if that were metal and this is your other metal
yes
you know, what you say that's split
yes, where it's gotta go on
yeah, gotta go on like that in't it?
yes
now, for my money now if that were loose I'd open these
shall
no
strip, straight them open so that, they're like that a bit instead er 
ah, yeah 
straight like that
yes
and then if you did that it would tighten on to your walls
yes
and you could make, adjust it and it'd stay there
ah
but over the years it's got loose and you've probably fiddled and it did broken
ah
I should have them all metal cos ours is all metal as you see
mm
but I'll make you one in, two in plastic if you like
yes you want one of them 
no, no, well 
whatever
it'll be easier
these are the best then
these get fairly hot
yes
and er  you see these get, well, they're not too hot there
yeah
but, there's your wall look  er what we done with it, there's your wall, that goes, should run er, like that
yes
then you can adjust it in or out
ah I've got it 
just to get it in the right
yes
location
yes
you see, well to keep it tight
yes 
you open those prongs
yeah
and of course it's probably been 
yes 
over tightened or it's
and that's all they were fasten on with that sort of stuff 
that's it 
mm 
just slide off
would you believe it, it's
if, if you like I make it all in metal
oh yes, which evers you wanna make 
well I'll make er I'll make two in metal and two in plastic and then see how you go on 
no make two in metal instead
 
oh that won't take me five minutes to do that, it won't
oh I know your five minutes Arthur, five hours 
it, it, it be a quick five minutes 
usually always
how the birds going oh
I thought you were feeding 'em when
oh I was looking you see
just before you went upstairs for a bath 
yeah 
you were cos I when Les came I thought you were still feeding them 
apparently on these you know you twist them
yes, I, yes I've never bothered with 
you do know that, not too much 
them, I mean er
but if, if you twist that, that way
yeah
and that the other way
yeah
you get erm one going that way and one going the other 
yeah and also they go better as well don't they?
well they're nicer you see
they should go better really shouldn't it?
mm
if there
have you seen the records Les is, oh he's going to feed the birds before seven 
I think you'll find there's quite a selection there and they're, sort out what you want and that you know and er, ooh there's lot of the old ones and every thing and 
mm 
yeah
well he's busy taping nearly all, our old records
is he?, yeah
well they're easier to put in the tapes 
yeah 
are
that's right
you, you haven't got a tape machine?
no, no
no
no
well we only bought ours last year
yeah, yeah
but as were getting older we find
yes
put a tape in ea without any trouble I can't 
that's right no
I can't see to put the needle on properly on the record 
no, no 
Arthur says I scratch them any way
oh 
trying to put it on so 
ah yeah
so I never bothered with the records
no
but with a tape
yes
just slot them in
yeah
and that's it 
no with the, er
in fact if I'd known you hadn't got one, the one we had before, oh know it's not got a tape on though, but you've got a record player haven't you? yes 
yes , yes
right, I mean the record player that we've got and radio was quite good
yes
but it hadn't got the tape
no
thing
no
and we gave it to the erm  school at over Downing Drive
oh yes
for, when they were having their sale for their sports and swimming pool or something 
oh yeah, yeah , mm 
I mean we had given to us our friends, mad on radios 
yes, yes 
and er, you know, he always wanted the very latest and
that's right, yeah 
when he got some money
that's right
he, he decided to have erm video and every thing and cassette 
yes 
music centre
yeah
so erm, he said would you like it
mm
instead of your old record player
ah, very good
so, er we had it for about four years and then Arthur decide to have one of these last year .
yes, yeah , yeah 
It's funny about Ellis having ya, I think, I think 
yes 
the re-unions though wouldn't be the pre-war would they?
oh I don't know this, this Eileen said something about they had one the year previous
yes but for what year?
but they didn't when they're having the next one 
oh it was of your age though
oh yes oh yes 
oh, oh 
same age as me
oh
yes
because not many of the
 
you know when your
was you er, was you in the hockey team or any thing?
no played 
no 
hockey but was never in a team, no 
I , us there were one or two er
you were in a football team?
yes and then there were the er
what other name black, Dora 
oh yes, oh I know Dora  she used to be in our dancing troop

We've got a fair length in there haven't we?
Yeah.
Cos it was  good!
You know, there was more than enough really.
I keep going hot and now I'm cold, and then my throat's hurting.

We shall have to see shan't we?
Shall we not?
Oh dear!
No, but if they took Les's garden you see  the other side  would be a rubbish dump so 
Mm.
True.
But then 
They probably wouldn't take it.
it won't always be a rubbish dump 
I know , but
Yeah.
but  you wouldn't want a photograph of your  garden a and a
rubbish the other side.
Well that's only a little bit that bit is.

We had a piano but  nobody 
Mm.
ever complained about us practising.
Well, you got good neighbours then, that's all I can say.
She came and knocked on the door and then we went back and I, I said what you stopped for?
