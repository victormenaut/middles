Eh?


I'd be owing to the stage Mike!


Won't be!
If your lass sees it cos she thinks you've gone shop.


You see, ours is more interesting than Robin's.
Be fucking handy!
Yeah, well you're getting ready to make a bi bid for that er, Shearer.
They won't let him go unless they're gonna replace him with a stag.
More money though.
Well they're wanting eight hundred thousand  well, to start with, he's going to Southampton.
Lee Martin's five hundred thou, Robins is a million, Dave Moore's on loan at Blackmoor, Blackburn  he's getting, he had a million quid in it for  decided they want him.
That's go there ain't no money ready  to make a bid.
Have you calmed down like?

But all I kept getting was thirty four 
 
thousand.
What are you gonna do next year?
Thirty four thousand.
Thirty four thousand!
Fucking hell!
But you wouldn't give me straight answer would you?
Well of course I would!
I mean 
Don't get anyone to  get the bloody training 
Man United not 
to er
Man United don't  to the fans.
 
I mean, Leeds you've gotta find five hundred pound next year to get into 
No.
ground.
They've asked us.
Eh?
Two and a half million towards
You know what I mean, they're thinking of the working man there aren't 
 
they?
Eh?
And they think, do they, everybody who er own their businesses that go and watch Leeds?
You know,whe where does a working man get five hundred quid to go watch a bloody match!
You know, I mean
You have pay that over the season don't you?
Eh?
It does for our lot, you know.
Well I'm going.
Take the money  it's just to get our two and a half million.
Well you've gotta .
But Ward, five and a half million for a new stand.
So it's gonna drop down 
But they're not, but over next ten seasons  they only pay, they get hundred pound knocked off the season ticket.
Yeah.
They get first choice for  European Cup tickets
A lot of clubs 
seats 
play in that though.
Yeah, but I'm saying, that's how that's the deal is like, and it seems reasonable.
But you put five hundred pound in a bank for seven years


you'll get probably seven hundred pound back at end of it.
Anyway
Know what I mean ?
They're not thick, they know what they're doing.
Oh aye.
I know that.
Big money, that!
Well, they do
But they said if they don't get it by a certain date 
Look, we're all working men here aren't we?
they'll leave it.
Could you afford five hundred pound to go and watch  a match next year?
Working men?
