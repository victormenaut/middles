Even if they say it's out
No.
I don't believe they could ge 
It might not be out.
I don't believe they could get lost coming round here not with all the back fields on fire.

All that time.

And I didn't put it over there.
Where's the erm  comma?
Just down there.
No it's not.
Yes it is!
Oh yes it is.
Do not argue!
Er  I want the co oh!
I dunno!
What are you doing?
I'm not getting far.
in capitals.
Actually what?
Yeah.
Supposed to leave a space Emma!
Shut up!
Slant your address.
Mind you  if  she was erm  she weren't in love with a poor man, then yeah, but no  I don't think she is.
Mind you
had his other girlfriend didn't he?
He packs  his girlfriend in then went  with Jane, but he was still going out with a girlfriend  if you know what I mean.
He went, she was pestering him.
Mind you, I don't know 
And he asked Jane to go down to sort her out  but Jane's scared of a fight.
Jane's scared of offending her.
I know.
Mind you, I'd feel now she'd mucking up.
Yeah.
Well her mother's gone and mucked up everybody's life.
I don't think it was her mother  to tell you the truth.
I think it was erm  him.
Mm.
Mind you  well  going, going erm  getting her best friend's husband  and lived next door to them as well!
Mind you, if erm  someone erm thought of erm  if you're on your own and a man says to you  I'm married but I don't like it can I come and live with you?
I would say no!
And you sort of like him and
Make no difference.
Well mind you, she's thick anyway, so
She'd have to be with that hair!
Oh!
And I, I really wouldn't believe that her friend couldn't see what was going on?
They used to have walks didn't they, all together with the dogs?
They were like sisters.
Well she should have known.
Mind you  when she says erm, when Jane says th she went on holiday with them and her mother and father's  and that's when they split up.
But I think it could have been over him.
It could have started years back  you know  but who's to say.
He  mind you  but old men  don't they?
Mm.
Don't they just.
Mind you   got out.
Yeah.
He'd done the right thing.
Yeah.
Jane's done sort of a good thing by getting out, but  she's gonna have to be  an idiot
A 
Yeah.
 
 
Even worse!
Yeah !
Yeah.
I can't undersa I can't understand how comes she's got involved with the first ma guy to come along?
I mean, in school
You can't really call him a man.
He were wet behind the ears!
Alien!
Looks like an alien !
Believe me, with that body and that head he does look like an alien!
Mind you  if she thinks she likes him then  go for it!
But  in fifty years' time we could be saying well did Jane pick the right one?
And their marriage has lasted.
But th then again we could be saying  we sa we told you so!
In fifty years time I could be married.
But I doubt that very much!
Urgh!
Some things will be better if you're married.
Oh there's quite a few.
I don't think Jane's got any erm  brains when it comes to men.
She's got no brains at all.
She's got no brain!
I mean  in school right
Mm mm.
the simplest test you could ever do  she failed!
She got three!


Erm  just because I got  ten, if you got ten, you passed  if you got under ten you're a drip  that's what  said.
Mm, so she's a drip.
And she was saying to me, she says, I wish I were brainy like you!
No.
She says I'm brainy, I'm brainy!
Well we all can't be born with brains can we?
Well your one ma one erm  that er example 
Got some , I've got some brains somewhere they just  keep falling to sleep!
And
I doubt if your brain would fall asleep Tracey!


But it could be true  your brain might be asleep after  mind you  if you went too erm  mouthy at work tomorrow  shut your mouth  then your brains would be working!
Yes but she's not coming in tomorrow is she?
Shit!
Well no.
Mind you, it we it was quiet today.
Very quiet!
Er very, very quiet !
I can't believe how much I got done!
Well the letters were going alright  but when it came to that  the  
The menu.
party  oh!
The menu I can do, I've do that's fine  but,
Well my typewriter my typewriter were going funny  it really was.
But when I pressed O  it turned out W  but  you know as we're typing and all of a sudden you've pressed O, and then I say I press W  I got W up  but no O.
as if I'm 
Every time I 
sticking.
every time I pressed a key  the ribbon kept flying up!
It's either the correction button going or you need a new one.
No, the ribbon's alright.
It's the correction button then.
Cos you put the ribbon in didn't you?
No.
You had a  oh!
You had this one didn't you?
Yeah.
Now I'm gonna put S I.
Changed over.
Mm.
But I think  those bigger ones, that ones they had to have  today, is better than the ones you're on.
Even though I can't find that  button to  take the other ones off.
Oh I know!
I couldn't find that one.
I pressed every button I could find and I still couldn't find it.
No I couldn't.
I kept getting percentages.
I didn't want  a percent !
I wanted the other one.
Mind you, if they give us a  manual.
Mm mm.
I wonder if Jane used one?
Mm.
Now she was where we were and that office junior turned up she would have gone for there and I prob bet she will probably be quite
She would of.
Mind you, I could go for it anyway  if I wanted to.
But who wants to work in a solicitors?
Be fun!
Yeah but  they treat you as a  skivvy.
Oh do they?
Make make 
 
make coffee, make tea, coffee, general duties
General dogsbody more like it !
Probably.
Yes but where does general dogsbody lead?
Mm.
The front door mostly !
Oh aye.
Oh well like she said today, there's no guarantee of getting a job at the end.
No.
But in some cases there are.
Now there's us working  working, taking everything in, working slowly  taking everything in  piece by piece  we could end up with a job at the end of it  cos we know what we're doing.
Cor!
Do you think so?
Like she said to that new girl  take your time  learn it, get to know it properly  she said  you  learn  what was it?
Well actually she said erm  what did she say now?
If you do it properly first time around you'll know it  all the time.
Mm, mm mm.
But then she's  taking it  here, do it!
But I think  tomorrow I'm gonna take it in and tell her I can't do it.
I was thinking about saying that !
Well you shouldn't lie to her.
The books haven't come in yet.
You should tell her that you can't do it.
I suppose you're right.
Mind you  get in early while ev before everybody else  gets there and we'll ask if she can explain it to you.
.They stopped  when Annette went through the   right?
Mhm.
Then he stopped.
And she went at around one o'clock.
And it was two o'clock when they stopped talking, they stopped having their break!
I've had, one!
No it was two o'clock when they stopped talking.
They started their break at one o'clock  and finished at two.
Well they were still working when we left.
Yeah, because th they keep nattering and  they don't get nothing done and then it   after then, but we've gone.
But it's ridiculous!
What do you call that one with the  big, Mary is it?
I don't know.
Seen her today.
She has finally stopped saying she's got, she's had office experience.
And she
About  she actually says that about 
No.
Jaws.
No!
Oh I mean, you are talking about Jaws?
Yes !
I'm talking about Jaws.
She hasn't said, since we said that   off that time, she hasn't said anything about her office experience.
And she hasn't mentioned the incident with the erm  copying machine.
Mm.
Well anybody knows she actually int  cos there was nobody in there to, to see what she were doing with it.
No.
Suppose, I suppose if erm  Pat or erm  Annette wanted to find out what really happened they'd ask Dianne  and Dianne would tell them cos they, they get to find out the truth then  and she was lo lo lying.
But it was a bit of a coincidence when she walked out that day and er  she didn't come for a week!
She didn't come back for two days.
For a week!
A week?
Yeah!
She didn't come back all week.
I had flu!
She didn't have flu!
She said, I think she were gonna wonder what, what they're gonna do to her  for  for the copy machine.
Yes!
Mind you, they're well suited!
They're both big!
And bulky!
Urgh!
No.
. If she'd have got  done the pho photocopier machine she would have got, she would have got all she deserves!
She would have!
Just cos she's erm  worked in an office before doesn't  doesn't mean to say she  she knows everything  like she implies!
Well look at me, I've worked in an office before but, do I know everything?
I don't know, do you?
No!
Enough to run the  photocopying machine !
Well you're one up on me cos I don't!
I know how a basic computer works  I think.
Yeah, I don't, I don't think I'll forget about that.
I can type.
I can type.
Mind you, you get .
We'll put the flags out when she leaves!
I'm just frightened that, in the 
She'll
  

What about  !
Erm  no!
No way!
I couldn't do that.
But I keep ra every time I close my eyes I keep wondering if she's gonna pop up with the same er
We started there on the twenty sixth of December, November
No!
When we, in the, in the , in the  the erm
It wasn't the twenty sixth of December 
We 
because tha 
when we first started there on the course itself, typists  first time we got into the erm    it was the twenty sixth of erm  of December.
It wasn't because Christmas 
 
Day was on the twenty fifth of December!
Course  !
It's the, the, er what was it now?
Twenty
It was the week before.
Twenty something.
Wasn't twenty, it was erm
It was twenty something.
Erm  twe twenty nineteenth.
Nineteenth!
Nineteenth or so something like that.
So from that day  from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, those four days we have there  Jaws kept saying, but I haven't worked i but I have had office experience 
Yeah.
and I have had office experience.
I've worked in an office before!
If she's worked in an office before how come she's there?
And learning to type?
And er, she hasn't had any qualifications.
No.
And her husband's eight years older than her!
Oh!
She keeps saying that every time, she keeps saying that!
I know, that's the new one int it?
Husband's eight years older than 
I feel sorry for the poor man!
No you should feel 
I've 
sorry for her!
Yesterday  ye yeah, yesterday someone came in saying sorry I'm late there was an accident.
And she started on about it!
She's like that!
You meet many people like that.
Sh and she really, and she makes me laugh when she said, talking to someone and when they start  working again she turns round to the next person at the other side of her!
She's got no need to talk about other people.
She should talk about herself!
Mind you  I think she owns the place myself.
Ha!
Like when the boss is around she goes ooh!
She's as bad as me and  you !
Ah!
Not quite.
You could both the  the building shake!
Er  Did she give up smo did she say she gave up smoking?
Yes.
Well I think it was her.
My mum gave up smoking.
Stupid to start anyway!
Yeah.
I mean, what does it do for you apart from 
Give you bad breath, make your clothes smell  awful!
taking your money.
Takes your money.
Well fo for that much money you can easily just say, look I'm going away.
Yeah.
No, I wonder why?
Er, a certain Canadian!
Yeah
Mind you, I suppose you'll go off with the Italians.
One Italian.
Well, they've got the right kind of  equipment!
Yes !
That's a new one, equipment!


Oh!
A few days ago it was the right body, but  equipment!
Well I don't mind if he's got all of these!
Oh well it's just the luck of the draw there.
Mm.
So  I like  Canadians  you like  Italians.
And don't forget the little Canadian.
Oh!
Oh little?
Mm.
You can't call that little!
Ooh!
We've got muscles  on his eyelids!
Little Canadian!
What about his brother?
Tiny Canadian?
Well he's a only a little bit, he's only two hundred and thirty four pounds.
Only!
Mm mm!
Not very big.
Big enough.
Mind you  you've only gotta look at Jane's boyfriend and he's about  two pound weakling!
I wouldn't go that far.
No.
Neither would I.
I noticed!
That's right!
Would she never go for likes of erm  Matthew ?
 
No.
She goes for the ones who erm  think she, they can protect her, but when it comes to the crunch she'd have to be the one that protects them.
She's good at protecting !
Oh!
Well she did 
That's right.
when his ex-girlfriend came around!
She'd let him  he'd be .
Pretending she were a dog!
She's no need to pretend!
Well she does look like a Rottweiler a bit don't she ?
Oh!
Get out!
I like Rottweilers.


They look like Shaun.
How about the  chihuahua ?
Now that's Shaun!
No!
I pulled them.
Shaun?
Yeah.
Do you know something?
I don't know why but  Hit Man look  tons better in  clothes than he does out of them.


He does!
I've told you that's because he's erm  leggings or whatever they call them th they wear but  the 
Leggings tights.
stretch yes
Yes well
tights we'll call them  they stretch out.
Mm.
They make him look fat.
Now they're all he wears.
Urgh!
Well, I don't know what he's trying to hide !
Or trying to erm  save  but who wants to wear them kind of trousers?
Oh I don't know I used to  boyfriend.
Oh I can see Emma wear, wear  did wear them.
He's grown out of them though ain't he?
He's grown out of it.
He's grown out of it.
Andy said he wanted some of them.
Oh!
Oh!
They're awful!
I think it was him, or was it David?
It were one of the two.
They are absolutely awful!
You don't need to tell me!
I've  it's yo it's not like we was ?
Can't see !
You move onto the
His legs.
I always start at the back so there's nothing else.
Er  now whenever I 've me I honestly wish  he would go under a sunlamp  and melt!
And melt!
He is pathetic!
Underline pathetic!
Mind you  I suppose his head is erm  smaller than his shoulders so that makes him  like  like a, sort of normal person.
A wimp!
Ah!
Did you see that ?
Yes.
Coming back.
Mm.
Er  what about that line he came out with?
Something about  don't go with the zero when you can go with the  ero !
 Ero !
Oh!
If he's an  ero I'd rather stick with the zero!
I'd rather stick with Superman!
Even though he does fly around in funny tights!
Wears his undies on the outside!
Now I have seen Martin   and they are fifteen  well built
Mm mm?
Mm.
Just the right kind of shape
Fine!
to go with his  body  which is also well built.
Well I thought Shaun was gonna show his legs but  no he didn't.
I don't think he will, not with the erm  heavy bandaging he has on his leg.
Should wrap it round his face!
Would 
What 
be an improvement!
Oh!
Shut up!
I used to like that !
Well you were the one who said you wanted to marry him!
I've quickly changed my mind about that!
Mm.
Very quickly!
Mm!
I suppose it'd be alright if you find the right person.
Yeah.
But after a time the right person could tie you down.
The right person sometimes turns out to be the wrong kind of person.
I'm glad I've got two to choose from.
Oh yeah !
Are you quite sure it's two?
Yes.
Quite sure.
Oh!
I had three last time.
Well  just depends don't it?
If them two turn out to be
Creeps!
unavailable   is available  and any offers
No way!
I might just take him on it!
No way!
Why?
He's too big!
Yeah, but he's the right kind of height.
Cute and cuddly, yeah  but  muscle-wise
I know he's got muscles  bigger than  muscles !
I think he's bigger than Arnold Schwarzanegger myself!
He's just a big friendly giant that's all.
I don't think yo I think you may be right but  I don't think I could keep up with the different kind of hairstyles!
I didn't know he changes hairstyles every day.
Mm!
Mm!
It looks the same to me, until he's  had it cut back a bit.
I think it looks alright when it's cut back.
Mm mm.
Well I like it over to the side.
I like it like that, it looked cuter like that.
Mm.
Mind you, I think I'll have my hair shaved off.
Wrestle mania, see.
Where he took on Hulk Hogan for the championship round?
No.
Way before that.
In the ultimate, while he were there.
Ooh!
Dead cute!
Mind you, he isn't the sort of
he wasn't the wrestlers that I liked.
If you know what I mean  it was wrestling in those funny kind of shorts.
No it wasn't.
I remember last year  his jacket  now that was nice!
Ah!
And he looked good in that jacket.
I've seen him in a proper leather jacket.
A proper, proper leather jacket!
Have you?
Yeah.
I, do you know something?
When he's in clothes  when he, not wearing his wrestling tights, or trunks whatever he calls them
Shorts.
he looks smaller.
Oh he don't, he looks bigger.
No!
He looks smaller.
You know height-wise but  muscle-wise
Muscle-wise bigger.
more wider
Yeah.
which, you should be in shorts.
You know that  stripy T-shirt I've got  the 
Mm.
black and white one?
He wears one exactly like that.
Oh you, what you mean when he finds erm   
Yeah.
Yeah.
And a leather jacket.
Mm.
They're probably wearing those awful !
Oh yeah.
I bet they're all wearing them boots!
Oh!
I've, them yellow ones with the black  Christ!
Urgh!
They are awful!
It's like bananas going bad!
Oh my God!
Mind you, it can only happen in America.
Yeah.
And Wrestle Mania si seven  no now that was funny!
Yeah.
Ah yeah!
That's
ding ding, ding!
Oh!
Where did she find that dress?
Oh God!
She must have borrowed it off Derby!
Oh!


They were awful!
Yes.
Not, it was erm, a sequined one.
Yeah.
And it was awful!
Low cut  thin straps  fairly short  I am almost positive she borrowed that off Barbie!
Mm.
Or could she have got it off one of those star dogs!
Mm!
She could have!


Mm.
I wonder if they're going to go out this year?
this year.
Mhm.
Er  where they've just held the erm  Superbowl.
Ah!
Football!
I hate that trash!
Yeah.
American football.
Mm.
I can't understand it.
Oh I can.
Yo se you erm


Erm  there are a lot of touch downs.
If you get the ball in  
!
it's a bit like rugby.
It's a cross between rugby and football.
I don't know.
Now if you can understand rugby or football then you can understand  
I'll stick, I'll stick , I'll stick to wrestling  can understand that better.
Oh yeah!
Get in 
Er the 
the ring, ding ding, start fighting  down, you're dead and that's it!
Yeah well I know all the  wrestling.
And I also get rugby.
Mhm.
I know what a wrist lock is  I know what an arm lock is, I know what a head lock is.
Yes Tracey!
We all know what you know what it is.
I also know what his mum's like.
Ah!?
Big.
Daft.
Big
He's daft!
I don't know.
Big!
Mm mm.
Yeah.
Can't wait till they come back over here.
Ha!
Well I can.
Oh !
Maybe, next time we'll get to meet them  close up.
I got really, fairly close up this time.
If you say you want to meet them close up
That as well.
Yes I do.
You never know what could happen.
Yeah.
They're gonna take one look at you and run the other way!
That is not funny!
Sorry!
Anyway, who's to say I couldn't be erm  the next Mrs Hitler, or the next Mrs Genetic?
Or both at  the same time ?
Ooh no!
I get too tired!
No, I shall settle just for one person.
Mind you, you could let your thoughts wonder a bit.
Well  they do wonder !
Wonder why you're stuck over here and they're over there.
Mm.
Wondering why they never write back.
I've come to the cil er, conclusion that Americans don't know how to write.
Th they know how to make everything bigger than anyone else.


And go over the top.
But they do not know how to put pen to paper!
Mm.
It's nearly three years  since I started writing, I haven't got
It can't be!
Nearly three years!
No two.
One 
Yeah , nearly two years.
No.
Eighty nine  ninety one, ninety two.
Two years.
Two years this August.
Crikey!
I didn't think that was so long!
I have written  in two years  and not one reply back.
Not one reply back!
Probably
I don't know if it's my writing  or what !
Probably is.
It could be you know.
Even when I typed it.
There's got to be a reason that they have not replied.
Yeah.
They just don't know how good erm  ways I'm gonna 
Oh no!
I'll send them a photo next time then they might reply.
Yes they will definitely
No one with pictures please!
Or send them one of Jaws!
 
Oh!
Then they'll have to reply.
I'll send them one of Jane.
Oh no!
I don't wanna scare them.
Put Jaws and Jane together.
They'd not know the difference.
I mean Jabber Jaws.
Mm!
That's what I mean!
Mm.
Mind you  if Jabber Jaws  and Mrs T over there,talking,you wouldn't be able to stop them !
They'd find 
They could have a talking competition.
they'd find any of the conversation under the sun to talk about!
Mm.
And then every so often it's  I've had office experience and  my husband's this, and husband's that and  my brother-in-law can do this, and my brother-in-law can do that!
Yeah.
Oh and I've stopped this and I've stopped that!
Oh!
Haven't you e have you heard her?
And don't forget my husband's eight years older  than 
 
Shh!
Well I suppose it's better than being twenty years younger or whatever.
Or even fifty years.
Might even got married  cos somebody   older  I don't know if it was fifty
I don't know.
I know someone in the States has married an eighty year old and she was only eighteen!
Urgh!
Yeah?
Yeah.
He was eighty and she was eighteen.
But he was eighty, she was eighteen, not he was eighteen and she  was eighty ?
I said he was eighty!
Nearly eighty one.
And she'd just turned eighteen.
Silly that!
Well of course it is!
How long do you think they'd have together!
Mind you, do you know that if you'd marry somebody  erm years older than er  and that, she says, well if I die she'd have the money.
But  also sa 
That's it int it?
also said that  when that person, if she married  somebody, say fifty years older than her, that they died and didn't leave her  to pay.
Then she'd be laughing!
But, she doesn't want children.
Well she's just a number anyway, whether you  stick together.
Yeah.
Mind, don't take it too far when you've got  when you go in er, an eighteen year old married an eighty one year old  now that is going too far!
What about  someone twelve years younger?
Mind you, I suppose it's better than being fifty odd years older int it?
Mm.
Well, look at Tom and Marjorie they were  she was eight years younger than him.
But thank God it didn't last!


No I won't hear of it .
If he'd of married her, she'd be er  pancake.
As he said in that advert, she's pancake!
Pancake?
Yeah.
Hit by a steam roller !
 
Oh!
four people.
Yeah.
Do you know I  if you ask Andrea about it, anything  she'll probably go on for ages, and ages, and ages, and ages!
Well yeah, even when we probably don't though.
She lives on her own now!
Oh yeah!
Brand new, this year.
Well mind you, I like  and my dad says   is your mum twenty one again?
And he goes no, she's thirty four !


Oh!
And Beryl phoned my dad.
She doesn't tell you everything about does she?
No.
Mind you, kids don't anyway do they?
No.
Well Brett doesn't.
I still can't get over  being over the edge.
Course you can!
I can't.
I can't think    hitting him but  I don't think I could put him over the edge.
Er er er, I can't remember him throwing him over the edge.
Mind you, that's my violent temper.
Mm mm.
We all know what your violent temper's like!
Mm mm!
Make a good wrestler.
Oh shut up about wrestling again!
Mm.
It's my favourite sport!
It's not your favourite sport  it's  the hunky wrestlers themselves,that's your favourite sport !
Only two!
Er  two and half-ish!
About two and a half-ish.
Three-ish.
Why's that?
Well the
You can't be  than six.
 
Er, you love .
Mm.
Oh !
I wonder how we're gonna  games.
I haven't got rid of this one er bloody yet.
Sorry I can't do these  they're off.
Goodbye.
I honestly believe I will cough up.
 
That's if we get a typewriter  I will be gone!
I will just fall apart!
Nothing to worry about.
I'll be a bag of nerves!
Mind you, what am I saying!
I hated the exams at school  I didn't think I'd have to go all  through them again.
I didn't think I'd passed.
Well hopefully they'll pass them round the table.
But I came out with an O level!
Do you?
Do you think you'll pass your R S A one?
It all depends  I, er, it's fifty fifty.
I know it  and I've passed then I'll say  yes, I can do it.
If I haven't done it  I and er
You don't need  bu but cos you haven't done it, you don't know if you'd pass it or  or not do you?
And if you get in 
We don't know anything about
if you go into the room  sit down in front of the typewriter and the exam begins, and you do it  you could pass easy, well I've done it and I've passed!
No need to worry about   then you get on to your R S A two !
Mind you, once you get to the know the typewriter and that I mean  you know what you're doing and you've done your R S A one.
And it stops breaking down with you.
And you stop swearing at it!
Ah!
One mistake!
I'd like to see that silly   next to us on the computer  going into an exam and the machine won't work for her properly.
But I'd probably end up breaking it!
Even worse!
Probably head-butt it!
Mm.
But
Or like yesterday when you  you stupid machine!
He looked at you as if to say  Jees!
She can swear!
I wasn't swearing!
Just said 
I know!
stupid machine.
I know.
He did, he did look at you though.
Mm.
Oh your face though !
Although I were really mad .
It caught me with my hand  I were going so well and all of a sudden 
And there's you thinking  well I'm on the other side of this book, well past you Tracey and   you had to  start all over again!
Oh I know!
But you wanted a bit of  lesson didn't you?
Erm, I probably would have done because I made lots of mistakes and I couldn't be bothered to go back  and check them !
Oh.
Yeah.
I think I might get another se seat tomorrow.
You're not having my seat!
There's no way I'm sitting next to 
Oh have you got 
Fat face!
It's not that bad.
No, she never does.
Mm.
No.
Mm mm.
Nothing interesting up there.
Conversation-wise or
Well it depends
All depends who turns up tomorrow.
Mhm.
I think Dianne said she was gonna be in but she won't erm   
Well if I turned up
Well, there should be, it's bound to be  when you starting a, you know, big exam int it?
Somebody in the erm  exam wouldn't it?
She could do it when no one 's here.
But they could of easily just said, well, come in Monday, Tuesday, off Wednesday, and Thursday and Friday  instead of having all them days off.
They should go in a separate room for the exams though.
And the per people who are not doing exams still can  can erm, do their work.
Oh I know.
Now it's not fair on those others that are in the other room  doing their exams there, and they're just making all that noise from the typewriters  in the other room.
And you're walking straight through.
Anyone!
And you're walking through, yeah!
It's not fair on them!
They should have had erm  you know,yo yo , there's another, there's another  erm  like another office at the top of us  stay 
Mm.
there.
And there's er, steps going up.
They should have erm  right up the top up there  they should have had that for an exam room.
Mm.
I don't think that  the whole office isn't big enough.
Should have it  should have separate room for the computers and for the typewriters  and for the Y T S students.
They have that, when I up there, the other place I was at, you know and  that judge thing, and I'll have it all to 
Yeah.
myself.
Er you had erm  a room for, you had erm  it were like school.
You had er  a class for   a class for postage  right?
Then you had  ee, you had, the white classrooms  then you had  er, a class with all yo with your compu computers
Computers.
computers  a classroom for your typewriters
Mm.
and you took turns at using it, each one.
Mm.
And  even though it was like a classroom situation they didn't treat you like children.
And they  like  the computer teacher  he wo he se he taught us  from the very beginning  step by step, or even how to plu plu push the plug in.
Well everybody knows how to just  push the plug in, but  he ta 
Well what do I have to contribute?
Anything.
Anything.
Normal day conversation.
Normal day conversation?
Yeah.
Is this part of your er, course  at college?
No.
No,i it's er a survey.
I, I think they want to  find out exactly how  words were used
Yes.
twenty years ago, and then compare it with what words are used  today.
So you need  people of my particular age group.
No.
It don't matter what age gro any, anybody.
Yeah.

I don't know Dave.
I honestly don't 
No!

See you don't!
Yo you can't know!
See  just, she  you said something about going in and ask her, and you said  they put it down with that money that went missing and so they didn't put it down until paid it, but we didn't pay it.
Yeah because they'd no knocked off somebody else as well.
They definitely had knocked off somebody else er i what it i

I mean, according to this, somebody's checked this.
It's not Mike.
I don't think it were Mike.
It definitely weren't me that checked it.

What Linda paid last week.
What you got for her?
You know the two pound what Linda 
Yeah.
paid me last week, that went onto Tracey's.
No it didn't.
It did!
Because I've just had a look here.
It shouldn't have.
It shouldn't have.
Yeah!
But I mean
What you got on loan 
Do I ever know who's whose in these  this house here?
Yeah!
Course you do!
Well you marked it in Linda's book!
Didn't mark it.
You marked it in in Linda's book.
I know!
But, on here  I've marked it on Tracey's 
What you got for Tracey on loans?
So you got a two pound transfer?
And what you got on Tracey on loans?
Off Tracey's onto Linda's?
Eh?
What you got for Tracey on loans?
Hundred and eight pounds eighty five.
Then that's wrong here.
How much is that, hundred and seven?
Hundred and nine.
Yeah!
Yeah!
This is what I'm just saying Dave!
Right.
But if I added 
The two pound 
if I add these up,th th there's, they're, they're, they're different again.
That is right, that's docks.
Yeah.
That's right.
But when yo when, when you come onto these
See!
oh that's Graham's.
Don't know how to do we?
Don't let him tell him does he?
Are you  up and  paid 
Yeah.
for these?
Exactly!
The two pound what was given  so I'll ask them to transfer that onto your  whose ever book  next week 
I mean, if I add all them up  right?
What?
I add all them up.
Yeah.
Whose is this one?
Tracey's.
Right.
Add that up.
Then add the two together  it didn't tally with that.
No.
But  can I ask you something?
Can I take  Linda's book in to have the total?
Get your book.
See I've  there's two pounds
I've cleared that.
Cos I never o know who's who in here!
So how much is it altogether?
Well all it is, all it matters with me 
Hundred and forty quid according to that innit?
all it is with me
Yeah.
I mean, he's paid me two pound, right, last week
But that was 
cos that were 
well, didn't it?
Didn't you?
You 
Well I 
paid me two pounds.
and one o 
 
Yeah.
I paid you.
Well I've put it onto Tracey's.
Okay.
It should be just under a hundred pound.
Er, there were two pound payment put through
Wanna get that 
the, the 
video?
er  and all it wants is doing is transferring off.
What are you looking for Tracey?
No.
It's over there.
All they'll do is put a  local transfer erm, thing in.
So it sho still should only be the two pound out.
I put it in the back of the red thing.
But what i should actual fact be, one should be owing two pound more than what it says  and the other one should be owing two pound less.
Yeah but Sue got it  Sue got all the  tried er everything I could to, to get it to  to tally.
Linda.
Yeah.
And then 
Hundred and one I think.
Hundred and eleven.
Eh?
Don't know what it should be.
Er
Hundred and forty six on this.
What?
On whose?
Tracey's.
According to this lot.
I haven't checked, no you've just said Linda before.
No,bu er on Tracey's  together, is hundred and forty six, forty three 
Oh no!
on this.
How much?
Hundred and forty six eighty three.
Hundred and forty four  eighty three.
But then I put two pounds, which should have been off Linda's.
Cos you didn't pay me owt off
You can have that.
I should have real ah?
You can have that.
I should have realized when I'd taken Tracey's book in.
Right.
I'd put it just down here, I marked it down here  when I were here last  last week.
I marked it as Tracey's but I were taking Tracey's book in weren't I?
So I 
So I 
picked Tracey's book up.
get a letter  from the girl there then.
Mm.
Yeah I know.
What about?
To say I haven't paid, but I have!
Well no you'll not get, cos I'll take this in  and say, look, can you just transfer two pound off Linda's onto this.
I mean, all it, all it means 
Off of Tracey's onto there.
Yeah.
All it means to me is one owes two pound more than other one.
No, no it 
but if 
it'd be, it'd be understandable if we were identical twins but we're not!
But we're not!
Yeah but I mean I don't 
 


I just  you're just names to me, do you know what I, I mean, I still don't know who, which one you are, now  even though you said.
Who are you?
Linda !
Eh?
She's Linda.
Yeah, I know.
But I mean
That's Tracey, this is Linda.
I dunno, I always think that one is Linda and that one's 
She's e she's Ivy's daughter.
I know.
Yes!
And that one's Ivy's daughter!
I know!


But i if you put yourself in my position  and  all you do is call 
God forbid it if ever I put myself in your position!
No but 
 
You know what I mean !
God almighty!
Yes.
Have you got Tracey's middle name on there?
On their books?
Tracey Anne?
Yeah.
Then you can't get really stuck can you?
Yeah, but I still don't know who Tracey Anne is there!
That one's 
You don't 
Linda  now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mine's just plain Linda.
I'll try and remember.
Ah?
Hers is just plain Linda.
When we get some money we'll get name tags!
Yeah.
Linda, Tracey's got a middle name.
And Linda ain't.
And I'm blonder
Yeah but
she's blacker.
but to me.
Yeah.
Dark hair.
Tracey hasn't 
Well I just know that Tracey and Linda and I don't know who's Tracey and Linda.
You know who Brian and David is?
Yeah, because they're  I dunno.
Brian !
No, I know, I don't mean  owt, owt wrong  but I just can't remember  these two names, I don't know why, there's something I've never been able to, cos I've always said to you ain't I?
Margaret  don't punish yourself!
Even these two get mixed up with us.
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's very, very 
I ain't   sometimes I check  and ask Tracey for Linda.
I don't know why it is but  probably because they're always together.
I think this is what it is.
And, I mean, even when I say  make a cup of tea
Who are you now?
I'll even ask them!
Don't I?
It's because a  there's summat.
I don't know why!
But I'll get yo that two quid transferred.
Would you get mixed up with her?
Oh chuff me!
That's, I bet that's some sports thing.
It's a load of shite that paper!
To be perfectly honest!
Yeah, I'll get you your two pounds knocked off o er
From Linda.
Tracey's onto Linda.
Listening Linda?
Yeah I'll cha 
 
Yeah I, no I know, I know where I got it.
And I'll just put a note in.
But I mean, that were a simple mista I mean you made a payment of two quid  didn't you?
Yeah that saves you making a payment don't it?
No, well  I mean, it weren't as though I hadn't put a payment in  it were just that  it probably was this taking Tracey's book  and I marked it onto Tracey's, er, Tracey's book.
Here he goes look!
And 
How do you know?
Eh?
But that  will be in together or not?
Do you think you can get me something  didn't he?
Must be in there.
I mean I have put a payment in,i it's not as though I didn't, I mean that was quite easy mistake to make, to me.
But erm  I mean, I don't know about other.
Cos normally they both pay anyway don't you?
I think I might have to er change the wallpaper.
Oh!
Don't you Dave?
Who'll come out?
Mike.
Ah?
When did you  pay in?
Last Wednesday.
Last Wednesday?
No, he's 
Eh?
been on holiday this week.
No!
Last week 
Week la 
week past.
week last Wednesday.
He said to Tracey, are you not paying?
were they?
I said, what have you come for?
He said is Tracey in?
I said, yeah.
What do you want her for?
He said can I have a word with her?
Don't worry about me!
I said no.
Mother!
Dad.
Don't worry about me!
No.
And he said, is Tracey in the kitchen?
Yeah but he's probably  done tha knows who's anyway !
I mean, I doubt if he'll know  who's Brian and who's Dave  to be perfectly honest.
Well, there you are then.
Eh?
off me.
That's why they're always going up to him.
Mind you, he and Uncle Brian they are identical twins  people can  find out who they are but, well they can't find out who we are can they?
Don't think it matters at work.
Oh your tea's here.
Yeah.
you can make  make it right next time with Tracey's and Linda's  anyway, if they hadn't done it in office because I can put  two pound what  Tracey paid  onto Linda's anyway, it'll still balance it out won't it?
Do you know 
No.
what I mean?
No!
It will, yeah!
No cos Ta Linda'll be a way behind then.
No.
Er say, I mean they normally give me three pounds don't they?
It's, it's, it's, it's th th the mix up has come on, in that book it's 
Yeah.
not on their cards.
Oh no, it's not on the cards.
But
I'll pay  as the erm
Well I'll tell you summat
No that  that were my mistake that.
I'm not having owt to do with this!
No that were my mistake, which er, is a genuine mistake, I mean sh you paid me two quid, as I say, I don't know who's whose now
And then you 
that was Linda now.
Tracey didn't pay that did she?
No.
Tracey didn't pay.
But I took Li Tracey's book in  and probably I've seen the Tracey and marked it down there you see  on Tracey's instead of Linda's, which, I mean that's a genuine mistake int it?
Well, who put that 
Well he doesn't 
on card?
Ha?
parcels haven't been marked.

What?
You've got to get one  very special  on your side .
I said that!
Make arrangements, and get people on your side.
Well you said that.
Oh yeah!
And I thought of something else as well.
And besides, if it's all rigged like they say you do  it'll already be arranged for us.
Music!
We need the music.
Ah!
No wait.
Well sort that out, later.
Mm.
The jewellery.

I would think of erm  having er  pearl necklace.

Oh no!
Diamonds.
A thick diamond will do that better.
Cos you see it cuts.
Mm mm.

Well mind you, what you could really do is just erm, sort of erm  have a hammer  necklace.
Hammer?
Hammer necklace.
Say it's, new fashion jewellery and every time she gets out of hand just bash her one!
Mm mm!
That's an idea !
Yeah, well I'm brainy.
I come up with all these ideas!
There's something else we have to arrange.
What?
Where to stay.
Well
If you're thinking what I'm thinking you better think again!
Alright, I'll think again.
We'll have to stay in an hotel.
Of course you could stay in an hotel!
Oh!
Now which one can we stay in?
So many to choose from!
Yeah but it's , is, you don't know where you're going first.
Hilton.

Family.
Friends.
What friends?
Tell you there's one  person I wouldn't miss.

I don't think Jane can  see Jane.
So  we're really going to do it then?
We're really going to take 
If 
the plunge?
Probably, yeah.
If we get accepted.
Yeah.
Be exciting!
Very!
And think of all the publicity.
Mm mm!
Getting recognised in the street!
Er probably.
The big welcome home we'd get if we came over here.
Especially if we came to Sheffield.
If we were there.
Yeah!
Home, a sort of  home ground as it were.
Mm mm.
We'd be Bryan Adams.
The attendants!
Nobody could be Bryan Adams!
But Bryan Adams could.
Well  oh yeah!
Mm.
So  but there's one thing   ambition  and it's to smash that silly cow in the face!
B I C T  I will personally do 
Well le ge well why don't we just use  both fists?
We could  sort her out together.
But you're forgetting one thing.
Double 
You're forgetting one thing.
What?
She wants what I wanted.
Please!
Don't ever tell anybody you fancy   Like I was saying, don't ever  say you liked him!
If you tell anybody 
Well you did once.
if you tell anybody  I will deny you are my sister!
I will deny everything!
Deny everything.
But it's true, I did like him.
But  honestly  don't know what you see in him.
Dunno what anybody can see in him!
He is awful!
I noticed that when the  camera 
 
got onto him !
You know that he is, you know what they say cameras pick up  things.
I've been on camera.
I'm going to be on camera.
I've been on camera and it is nerve-wracking!
Even if it was in front of the school  it was nerve-wracking.
Cos I made
There's one thing I don't like  and that's having my photo taken.
And it will be hard when we have to photos
Photo sessions!
And just think of all those cra cameras!
I know.
I always crack the mirrors I look in!
And all them people saying ah!
She's beautiful!
But she's not.
Well I mean but 
In her own way !
Well  put it this way

I think, I think maybe I would refuse to go, if I go in front of a T V camera.
Especially if we were doing an interview.
Ah!
And don't forget the talk shows we'd be on!
Ah no!
Do you think we could  do you think we could forget about this plan of ours  for stardom?
I know I'd, I know I would freeze.
I'm not doing it for stardom.
We could make movies!
No thank you.
You're right though  that's when I would freeze.
Starring role with Tom short Cruise.
Bloody hell!
No way!
He's too horrible.
Mind you  co could be even  worser 
What could be even worse?
Acting with Tom Cruise.
What could be even worse than that?
Acting with Dolf Lundgren!
Oh!
Gees!
Sylvester Stallone?
You're getting  worser!
Arnold Schwarzanegger?
Ooh!
No.

America, yes.
Canada .
I wanna try  white water rapids.
Ah!
You don't?

I don't know why.
It looks interesting.
It may sound interesting but  it's very dangerous.
Don't forget there's all those rocks  and the water is cold.
Alright then, I'll send Sherry down there.
I'd rather throw her off the Empire State Building!
One better  take her parachute jumping and forgo forget to give her the parachute.
That's even better.
Mind you  you don't want the ground splattered with  horrible things like that though.
No.
So that  sleep on it.
Yeah.
Well I'm gonna think about what I'm gonna put in that letter.
Mm.
I think it could do with changing.

So would mine.
And not dull colours.
No, not dull.
Not brown horrible shirts!
I think I might change my hair colour as well every week!
Oh no!
Not dyed, wigs.
You know, one week go out with red  the next week go out with  pink, pink, bright pink  or even  blonde.
Don't you dare!
No I won't.
You can go out with any other colour hairstyle, any other colour hair you want, but don't you dare go out with blonde!
No.
I won't go out with blonde.
Cos everybody'd be thinking you were me.


Mind you, does it matter?
Everybody says we're the same anyway!
Yeah.
Well  I'll erm  think about it.
I'll tell you what  after we've sorted her out  we'll sort it out.
Him!
Who thinks he's erm

The right word for him!
Oh I hate that name anyway.
It'd be a daft name to live with anyway for the rest of your life!
Mm.
Now, who'd want to be called  Ellen?
Ellen?
Yeah.
Sounds like lemon!
Shortened!
 
But
Urgh!
No way!

I wasn't gonna say
A.
A a Er I won't say it .

Yeah.

I wouldn't be meeting the wrestlers though.
You might be meeting er, the wrestlers  but I won't.
Why, what will you be doing?
Oh I'll think of something!
Something cheery and nice.
Well if you're on the same bill as him, well  could always just ask him.
Or even take her over.
No, ask her over.
No.
Oh no because she'd  tell everybody you were  used to be in  with  prat face, prat face !
I don't think I can do that.
Do that sheet properly at work.
What sheet?
That what she gave us to do.
Oh you mean on the erm
Background .
background .
We are making
Yes.
That one.
I'm dreading this term when that  assessor

You're not the only one!
She scared me witless when she said that on Thursday about  coming in 
Assessor.
but he, no one 's expecting him and  .
Yeah but he does,sh you don't.
You get told in advance.
That's alright then.
Didn't you hear her on Friday when she talked to us?
When  oh yeah!
Yeah I remember that.
What she says was  is erm
I think I'll try to do  put some more to this letter.
What she said was  last time the assessor came in
Mm.
they thought he only wanted to see two people.
He's gonna change his mind and
No.
Three.
What, what they thought is that  all the ones that 
He tells, he tells us tha that he's going to see two
No!
but when he gets 
It's not like that, no!
What they thought is because he's assessing them and she's, they're assessing us while he's assessing them.
If you know what I mean?
Alright!
Now, they thought it was only gonna be two because there's only two assessing people, right?
Yeah.
But it turned out to be three and she was put in this  an awkward position and she doesn't know what to do, the poor girl who got picked!
Mm.
They a they'll have the other two, they got told in advance  but this one, she never.
And  that's all that happened.
But she says you do,sh that you do get told.
But I'm taking no exam!
The R S A One exam!

Why?
I don't know.
Did she say you can use a dictionary?
Yeah.
Well that'll be da that's daft in your case!
Why is it?
Cos you ask me how to spell them!
Only because I can't be bothered to  look in the dictionary sometimes.
Ho!
No?
How long have we got till July?
February, March, April, May, June, July.
Not long!
Six months till July.
Well it isn't long when you're  in the old  .

No.
The mistakes are there in the words 
Well when I, when I re-do it  I'll write it out as I type it  and I'll  let you see it.
Okay.
First.
Can I see the other one?
That you won't let me see!
No!
Why not!
I said not!
Great!
So if I wrote a letter  and wouldn't let you see it, how would you feel?
I wouldn't feel anything cos I'm not really bothered!
What if it's about you as well?
Well if you write something about me  you write something about me!
And if I don't let you see it, I'm dead?
Yeah.
You're clever!
Very, very clever!

Really?
Until the end.
I didn't think he was anyway!
No I didn't.
Until the end.
That's what got me.
Mind you  the title was a bit funny because it didn't  Almost an Angel  but  if he died and he went to heaven, then he must have been an angel but came back down, he's still an angel.
Yeah, but an angel on probation, don't forget.
Oh the funniest part about it was when he  set these people's thing .

I know he's married his  wife's supposed to be in all his films int she?
She can't act!
I know.
She cannot act!
I don't think marrying the husband's gonna do much good.
Mm.
I'd like to hear her voice though, she's supposed to be speaking Iri Irish but I'd like to hear her voice.
Australian, American,Irish accent !
Yeah.
Bit of everything.
Mind you, we can't act either.
No.
Now  the best film I've ever seen him in  is when he gets killed at the end!


Or, even better  at the beginning!
The beginning's much better!
Mm.


We can hardly speak .
No.
Can't help.
Mind you, his movie career is going downhill a bit.
Yeah.
He's  Born on the Fourth of July.
Started going down.
Yeah.
Well, anybody could see that the stupid  bu er the way they've  he was made up to look like a forty year old and he still looked like a twenty year old!
Yeah.
And nobody can imagine him like that in  twenty years time.
Was Born on the Fourth of July after  Top Gun?
I don't know.
Or was it after Cocktail?
I think it was after Cocktail.
No, it were before!
It weren't, it was after!
It were after.
Now Cocktail would have been a, been a bit dull if he hadn't have been in it!
Yep.
Still like it when she's in  Babysitting .
That's a good film.
Mind you  don't mind going i in the mornings to work but  in the middle of the day
No.
Don't think you
No, but if you go in the middle you've got a chance to wake up.
Well I prefer to be in the mornings so 
You have to get early don't you?
Well you do anyway so it don't really matter.
But you've got some time to wake up haven't you?
Proba yeah but  well we haven't got all that long to go now.

But, next year will be fine.
It'll be alright by me.
And when would you like to make debut then?
Oh!

Or  when everything's settled.
No.
Better get in while it's hot.
Yes, but you've gotta wait for your visas and all that lot, remember, like you said.

What's that?
How are we gonna get you up in the air?
Easy.
Put me in an aeroplane!
Yes!


Alright then.
Your fear of flying  is over!
