And then he goes, he goes erm it's, it gets erm it really gets to me when I think people are chewing around school, I don't know what to do to stop people and  I wasn't chewing, yes well it looked like chewing, but I wasn't chewing!
Oh God it was so pathetic.
But just to call anyone a slut is just so rude.

I thought if M if Dr  looked at me and  oh are you alright, I was that angry to actually say something cos I wondered if, you know, shall I, if I shut up
Mm
I never I never knew whether to say anything 
it's probably safest to shut up about things like that though

Yeah.
Well you'd definitely got something but I
I know.
I haven't, mine's not quite as bad as that but er he was wrong I think.
I know.
Just say to  erm  I am er I mean Mr  told me 
But the point is

They're prepubescent dicks basically 
Yes no they don't have dicks, they have little knobs.
so stupid.


they're not used to girls being round till they're 
Yeah.
in the sixth form.
Yeah and also it's like if you  a personality here then you're doomed.
I mean when I got, when I got here okay  er when I was in the lower sixth and I like sort of got in and then like it was so weird being, I mean I'd never been to a blokes' school before I came here 
Oh really?
Really?
so I'd never had blokes in my class, it was really really weird
Yeah, I'm sure.
and they were such a load of dicks when we first met, you know, and they're just like trying to impress all the time  and now I mean you've been here for, what, a year and, year and a bit and 
And you know them and you see them when they look like shit in the morning and you see their 
Yeah exactly .
I mean  I went to a boarding school before I came here that was just like that  but, but it was more like, I don't know, the guys there, I had more friends that were boys than friends with the girls, yeah 
Mm.
because like  I don't know, but it seems like they're, they're  they don't, they're not interested in being friends with you er it's just like I wanna fuck you I don't wanna  I don't really wanna talk to you
Yeah.
urgh!
Who's a student here?
I'll do whatever I feel like when I'm   
I was thinking when I've left the school if anything else happens I'll just feel really pissed off and I'm gonna write a letter and say, you know, now I've left the school 
 
I feel quite 
Yeah and I'll say, I mean 
you are the reason why I left the school, you know, none of the girls are happy by their upper sixth, in the lower sixth you might think it's alright but by the time  
 
Yeah but in the lower sixth the fucking rules  
this time last year that  
I know, it depends how much you've been caught for.
Oh my God the time I nearly got busted!

For fuck's sake, when I was going, when I 
Well have you ever have you ever been busted for smoking?
