Finding the pressure on the ground, under my feet, is a very hard thing to do.
Last week, Joanne  wrote down the method of how to make a bridge.
Whilst the rest of us were copying down the maths work .
A car has four tyres, each of which tor touches two hundred centimetres square of ground.
If the weight of the car is eight thousand somethings, find the pressure on the ground, under the tyres.
We will use F equals S divided by A to find this out.
Right, F equals eight thousand, A equals four times two hundred centimetres squared, equals eight hundred and   ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a ding a boomsha 
Oh, alright then,you wanna know, ding ding ding ding ding ding ding a ding a ding a ding, ding ding ding a ding boomsha  oh, oh .
This is so boring.
