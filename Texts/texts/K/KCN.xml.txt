Jump down then Phillip!
And when I spoke to Mr , I said well  if I was renting a caravan and went to see it and it was dirty like that, I wouldn't want to take it on!
And, I said surely you have somebody who goes round and checks them before they're let?
No, he said!
So what they do is, apparently they wait for somebody to complain
Yeah.
and then they look at the caravan!
Do they?
That's somebody who comes up to rent it!
So I said and in that case then  probably  you move them into another caravan?
Oh no, we clean it and  they go into it!
I said, you mean to say people wait around while you clean the caravan?
I don't believe it!
You're alright , you're alright for your holiday, find a caravan dirty, you've gotta complain before it gets cleaned!
Ha!
People will !
They can complain to the Tourist Board.

There we are!
The way they do 
 
No, but these caravans
Should you carry on?
I don't know, is it here or over there?.
So you see, this is only way you can  them!
Get to a situation where you've had a caravan before  and to make any money to pay, you've then got to  buy another caravan  to subsidise that one  and you seem to be  it's sort of 
 
like a chain all time.
Mm.
Yeah.
And the profit you've had from one is paying the expense of the other!
Tha , if you're lucky!
Mm.
Yeah.
I mean we heard some horrendous stories last week, walking round didn't we?
Yeah, we did.

it's gonna be, you know what I mean, I just 
So  who covers the loss on the caravan and on the rental?

Listen, you could
He's the General Manager, like.

Now, we were  washing

Yeah.
and people were to come in here on the Tuesday.
Oh, well I I thought, I don't know .
A bus load er a  four, three or four bus loads from
Lancashire somewhere.
Lancashire or North of England somewhere.
Saying there was, what say?
Bus loads?
Three or four bus  three or four bus loads of .
Old age pensioners!
Pensioners!
Last week?
So they said!
That's what they told us!
Cos I said there's no way I'd sleep in it myself!
Cos it was too damp!
Well we never had any   last week!
Well somebody said it  .
I I  I might, I might be wrong 
 
like!
You know .
 
Well that's what they said!
I never see   !
You'll see a bus up there won't you?
Cos I'll .
We're learning  
Are you , are you sure it was this week, it was supposed to be?
No , not next week?
Last week, cos I had to get it all!
I had to have the bedding in here.
Mum , can I ?
You see the, the boy 
I mean 
that, that just got out?
Yeah.
He, it's his weeks holiday and he was going to come down 
Yeah.
here for the week.
Yeah.
Now, there's no water here!
Yeah.
Well, no hot water !
Well that's what they told us,
Yeah.
and that's why we've
Well that's  like I say, with the 
We must have the caravan finished!
the thermostat.
Yeah, like I said  with the actual water heater there, it's been, there's been water heaters in caravans like that for years!
When we to 
You know what I mean?
We only had this at the end of the 
Yeah.
summer.
And we've had trouble with it 
Yeah.
all the time!
Yeah.
But er  like I said, the fluing part of it, is, is out of our hands.
It's not 
Yeah.
it's not us who's put that on.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
The what, pardon?
The actual water heater, the re-flueing of it.
Oh!
Oh!
You know, the, the
The gas people.
it's  yeah the gas council and all, like, these new bloody laws they've bought in like!
That's right.
Mm.
That's why you can see they've all had them
Yeah.
they've had to extend the pipes  all this and that like, you know?
Yeah.
But it's down to be getting moved.
You know what I mean?
But that's all it is, because it's in a confined space  and with a shower going they're worried about fumes and all like, you know, the carbon monoxide, like, you know?
Mm.
Yeah.
But er  put it this way, I've been on courses, like I wouldn't  I use it.
You know what I mean?
Mm.
Cos er  like I say, if I'd had a window open or so you know what I mean?
That's right..
And all  if it's a little nippy you .
is it?
But I said, that they've been in bathrooms for years like!
You know they  and smaller bathrooms than that like!
Oh, well I don't know what to do!
But like I said, it  it's just, it's gonna get moved like, no cost to you like, you know what I mean?
It's er 
Yeah.
But an advantage to them!
Is that what you mean?
But if something went wrong then, this caravan was burnt  that's the end of it!
They  might just take those down.
Well i , cos the co , the insurance wouldn't cover it?
Cos they have got these records   will have these records.
No, you'll have a certificate then, and all, saying that the caravan covered, it'll be tested every year then.
So it isn't going to be used this week?
But, no
You know?
not this week.
No, not this week.
So we shall lose our insurance?
like that, yeah.
innit?
See that man and woman that , yeah?
Did you see these people in there?
What people?
A man and a woman.
There was two people sitting there.
They've just gone out.
No.
After you came.
Well they've, they bought a  a caravan down here, a brand new one!
Yeah.
And they bought it last summer  and they've had trouble ever since!
And they're going around asking people what !
What's up with their's then?
Well they've had to move the caravan !
It was dirty and damp and  !
They're going round the caravans   .
 Ay 
he hasn't come .
Oh!
Here Ricky!
Yeah.
I'd like one of your crisps.
Any one would think that you were tired all day!
Now we .
And you weren't told there was gonna be ?
No.
What the hell are they talking about?
Nothing!
We knew that they were testing them, and checking it over  and bringing it up to standard, but we didn't know anything about it other than that!
Only .
You  take one, that's your one.
Lovely!
Well it wasn't me anyway, I don't know!
Oh Mark'll be fuming that's for sure!
Can he do ?
No.
But what's in it for me?
.Ooh ooh!
How do you do it??
Alright?
Yeah.
Well I don't know what to do now?
I'll tell you what to do.
Do you?
Here without a damn thing, you can't use it can you?
What do you think?
you know?
They never asked me 
 
if they could  or the flue in so it's 
That's right, say it like that!
never been  repaired.
neglecting the .
Well having said, what, what is it all about?
It's because  the  no, no water heater should be in the bathrooms!
So where's that gonna go then?
Well it must either go in the kitchen or in the cupboard somewhere, but you know?
That's what they've er  put it to.
what you said to me.
Oh yeah.
Oh well we'll have to move won't we?
Yeah.
It's working, like gas-wise, like I say, it is  it's virtually, it's just the ventilation clearing out the  the fumes  which are given 
Mm.
off from it.
Do you see what I mean?
Well it is  isn't there a, there's a chimney above there isn't there?
Yeah.
That's right, yeah, but  but now  like I said, you're gonna have to , to have your certain pipes.
Like, have you seen them all going round?
They got long poles on the back step.
Will it'll be longer than that ?
No  cos they haven't done this one  because it shouldn't be in here!
Even in the fire?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be in here, like, that's why they haven't  that's why they've put it there.
That's why they hung on the to the shipment cos these aren't supposed to be in  the bathrooms.
Right.
You know what I mean.
You know?
The 
Alright 
I think there'll be a lot of people who won't move off  to be honest!
They won't do?
, cos they won't er  go to the cost of them.
But, like I say, we're covering that, like.
You know what I mean?
 Hoh 
He's bloody !
He didn't know.
He doesn't know, he's the only one I can think of.
He , he's, he's not in a position to say whether he knows or not.
He says he doesn't know!
Oh!
No, well I  
It's nothing to do with him!
It's not his department.
But he said there is a gang going round, and some are putting the chimneys on  and the others are going in and doing the flues.
And he said, it looks as though they've put the chimney on and found that the flue is the ba the boiler's in the bathroom, so they've had to come down here.
Said because it shouldn't have a chimney on it!
But he said, I don't know it's no , nothing to do with me!
It's the 
No.
Bri it's the British Gas that's doing it!
Oh  well that's right he's gotta blame somebody!
But he said, I would do it because I know, I've worked for the Gas board!
Mm.
I would know how to handle it.
I said, well there's one thing certain, I can't!
Perhaps , pay good money for it!
You said somebody wanted to know about .
Mum!
No, it, it,
Mum!
and she's going round, she's gonna try and take them to court!
So she should!
It's bis , I think they mean business people!
.And she's going  she got out papers and pencil!
Taking names and addresses who'll back her up!
Mum,.
You could see through the window.
And the rain comes 
 
in when you open the door!
Blimey!
And she said  and he said, well they told  didn't they?
Got three bus loads, three or four bus loads of people!
Yes of old age pensioners coming down!

Why?
Cos I'll make him!
 
We let him out .


 
No, I've been meaning to.
Come on Mark!
See you later!
Mark'll go bananas I expect!
Well now how long have they known you were going to rent a caravan?
Well it's been booked for three or four weeks hasn't it?
Ooh , more than that!
on the bed.
I was taking a long time!
What?
They're supposed to 
Ha!
Ha!

No, I mean this flue thing should of been .
The caravan's been cleaned!
Well you says they hadn't even washed the curtains!
I'll leave it till next week.

You said they hadn't washed the curtains!
They're not washing the curtains, they're putting new ones in!
Yes, well that's their er  stipulations and  that's  what they're supposed to do once a year!
It hasn't been done has it?
No, they're not!
Danny's paid for new curtains to go up!
Yes, I know!
But they haven't done it!
Mum!

Going home  minute of the day!
No I bloody haven't!

And that woman!!
I went out to check the date on the  and to turn the place over.
 Gees I was shocked!
Brand new!
She owned it!
Mm, yeah she had a  with her!
And I couldn't wait you see.
Well I'd have had it all on tape!
Have you gotta ?
Have you?
No, you'll have to get in touch.
I'll just pack things all up shall I?
Ha?
What about these !
Diamonds

Emeralds are they?

Yeah, and a ruby on the other!
You found the good bit !
Mm.
Well wait and see what er  Mark has got to say.
Mm  .
laying properly.
Aha?
No.
Let Danny do it.
That's them gone!
What's ?
Was that them?
I don't know!
No it wasn't.
Some
Who 
No 
was it?
.
So what did she say to you when she went?
She said  .
This woman and man.
Oh she said we'll make enquiries she said.
She was going on about the grass they've left on the
Do you think I could leave it just there?
But she was in a frenzy you could see that!
 
Yeah, she was a bit!
She's looking for somebody to back her up!
Mm.
And that's why I cannot get involved.
But we're gonna do it and she says she hadn't  as yet!
That's what she said.
Mm.
.
I don't think she said she's doing extra!
She says you'll have the bill for this!
Yeah.
A man just stated it!
That we're taking responsibility  we'll be moving out!
We won't get paid for it!
We wanted to charge them!
I don't know anything them see.
It might be that they're in under  promotions team.
Their only parking!
I see us having to 
Perhaps 
last year.
perhaps erm  perhaps they're only parking  their caravan on the  .
And only letting it to friends and I suggest 
Mm.
their grandson.
But er  somebody was in and left it all filthy and mouldy and  what for!
Oh!
Yes?
Had the cleaner gone in  it?
I don't know .
I don't think so, no.
How?
Because er, I've seen it and dirty and that.
And they're bloody cooker's filthy!
It's true!
I have seen it.
I don't think it's really clean, and they charge you for it!
Of course they do!
They're out to get all they can out of them!
Mm.
As he says  it, it's the biggest holiday 
And 
company in Britain  and he said er, they just keep under  their 
Yeah.
legal limit!
He said.
You can't get them to admit that.
And, and they'll keep all the profits that they can!
They're not gonna let you get away with a lot!
You know, such as new curtains!
They try to bother  them.
And I dare say, like these he said they  they've paid for their caravan, cash!
So that's close to ten thousand pounds!
And they thought it was an investment!
Where as now they 
 
find it had been better for them to have left their in the bank!
Didn't say it so many words, but that's what he meant!
And an investment on ten thousand's about twenty pound a week!
So it's a lot of money to , I would think.
Perhaps he can
She said thought, she'll only only let it out about six or eight times through the year!
Well they haven't got total control over letting it!
.
No.
Perhaps they'll go.
Mark is making his will  isn't he?
Ah a good !


Oh she's left her dolly in there!
Ooh God, Sally was taking her out!
Who's key are all those?
Dunno,.
I dunno!
Oh, she's, she coming back, look, there's her book and her pencil.
Mark.
Well Sally was right anyway.
This is the caravan  here.
Sally will take it off, Mark's   .
I don't know what this is.
Oh!
I know she bought any  there's her roller skates!
Oh yeah.
Oh well, I'm off!
I know, he was going into the office!
Why?
I can't find   he's not in there  in reception?
Perhaps he's gone to shops?
I don't know which way he's gone then.
What's  surname?
erm  No.
?
Dunno!
Perhaps you ought to look for a phoney.
In the phone book see if there's any there?
I dunno!
Then we can ring them, see what happens.
When we get home then.
Yes.
But what if 
Oh look!
Silly isn't he!
What about her doll and things?
I'll bring everything home if I'm going home.
 Tara 
She said they're getting money for nothing!
Hey?
!
Now we'll go and find mum.
Mm.
I can't remember, the man he said  .
Keep it on 
Ooh!
enough will be used at  from it.
Oh!and all do you think?
What kind is it?
A recording?
Yeah, a Walkman.
It's recording everything.
You put the headphones on and you can listen to your choir!
Which is far easier than the one you were using.
Mm.
Oh, you put one of them in!
Well it's going round like hell, any how!
Well yeah, it's taping your voice!
Oh!
Oh, I hope it heard something nice !
Yes, well they're listening  for slang !
Oh!
Oh my God!
I said to her check the phone boxes and Penny's in there phoning  Danny and , and bloody Lorna!
Mm.
I re , I er  I co , heard Sally
And  down there 
counting 
phoning them.
but I didn't know  who it was  and I thought, God, has Danny arrived!
He does sound, that woman!
Can't understand her!
Oh yes 
She's out!
I can!
She's in piling a bloody list!
Yeah, I'm, I, I can't 
And she's got it down  where do 
I can't 
you come from?
Your name?
I thought  when I was looking at her talking  and I thought, you're a school mistress.
I wouldn't say that, I'd have said  , she's a landlady.
And this is extra.
Oh I would have said she was a  school mistress.
And her  her  bed and breakfast is 
Was a school mistress!
bed and breakfast is er  paying  keeping this caravan.
No, I would say that they were 
And it's not 
retired and he's had a good job in his time.
And, and this was a little 
Well I feel he's 
But I said 
 
to him.
No.
I said to him  er that er  it was an extra  and he said that was the object of it.
Helps the pension.
You know?
He didn't say it in so many words, but
Mm.
It was an investment, that's what I said.
Mm.
He said yes.
So I shouldn't be surprised, they're both retired  and, and er   pension.
She said they've had  they've had a couple of days out here trekking, trying to catch people!
Their pension is  their pension and their bit of income  keeps them, and that's all sort of thing, in a little bit of luxury.
He  she's looking for tenants!
No.
How, I  did you find it clean?
Mm.
You know, are you happy with er  arrangements 
 
then?
What did you think of cleanliness and
Oh well of course that 
And then perhaps she'll take their names and addresses!
Yes.
And the date see, Mrs so and so was in that caravan on such and such date!
If ever it came to court!
Cos he said  somebody's got to bring them down!
Mm.
And he said, we're disgusted with our caravan!
Yes.
Well of course, that might be a private !
Well that's what I would say about this  if this was new I wouldn't let people go in!
Theirs might be a private caravan on the site, and le , like Jackie's.
And letting it as private.
See, Jackie won't let anybody in her caravan.
But she said  they've let it to people and they've just wrecked the inside of it!
Everything she said!
It's a total mess!
And it's a brand new last July we've had it, she said!
Mm.
And it's filthy !
Mm.
And she said that everything was mouldy  in er  you know the  even the curtains were mildew!
And how did she put salt round?
Because this is a hell of a lot damper today  than what it was when I had the salt about you.
you  but er  some people  
Course not!
Yes.
Well I'd never heard of salt being put down before!
But she  yes, she told me that in all, in the shop.
In the reception.
She said, put it 
Yeah, well 
down.
yeah, these might tell you but  I always heard that salt was damp!
Yeah but it attracts the 
The 
water in 
the 
the air, into the salt!
and of course, once it's in the salt, it's steams!
Well it's only now it feels like this!
It was not like this when we were down here washing it.
Well that's common sense when you think about it isn't it?
You put, you put a drop of water on it  you put er  a bowl of salt  and  that will go down  eventually!
Mm.
If the air is damp.
It's collected the water .
Once that's damp, that's rising the steam!
So how else do you keep it dry?
She said, straight to me now!
I said that caravan is soaking wet, I said!
The mattresses!
mm.
And she said er  well it does take time for them to dry out doesn't it, she said?
But I, there was people in it last week!
Yes I know, she said!
Well if she's covering
I said well there's no way I  
she is paid to cover the boss!
There's no way I'd of slept in it, I said and not  I wouldn't of done it!
Let alone, old age pensioners, I said!
And you know  we've been to a few caravans
Go in that end bedroom and feel the bed!
that feel a bit, caravans that we used to go to were like this chalet.
The chalets we used to go to  Mrs er  I can't remember her name now!
But her boys used to run steam roller outside middle house and I used to take them in.
She used to see  that the beds were aired.
She did see to them!
She put oil heaters  in the caravan  and she kept the  the mattresses in her bungalow!
She'd only got about eight caravans then.
And  then we went in and had a caravan  somewhere up by Aberystwyth, Ginnie and me, and you kids.
That was an old farmer's caravan weren't 
Yes.
it?
But it wasn't too, that was too damp to sleep on!
who won the bloody war,roof up weren't it !
There wasn't, there wasn't a cup and saucer each!
Remember?
Mm.
And these are no better!
I mean, caravans are caravans, call them what you like!
Only one saucepan we had!
And it was stew everyday if we didn't go out for dinner!
 
 
Ah!
And you  
Remember that cup of tea?
Remember that cup of tea   cos the water gave out on us at one stage!
Yeah, we had to walk across the bloody fields for water  !
And milk.
Yes, friendly  woman at the farm!
We should have had a time, we'd of had to go home!
Well who's caravan was it?
Oh somebody who's lived er  out  Gloucester !
Yes I know!
Perhaps that's where Aunty Ginnie got her 
But er 
bug from !
But erm


the  people at the farm  they were supposed to seen   you know, for her?
She made out that she was paying at the farm to  clean it.
Did you tell them that in the farm.
Well Ginnie did!
 
Got her to do the dirty work for   for free !
Well  same when we went and found them boys in it!
Oh he's walking back home in temper now !
Well it was a job to get in here  just after !
And now you're on the staff!
Oh  shush here's 
Now he 
somebody!
No, he's got another one!
No.
Yeah , they got a job to get him back!
Well it's clean here is it?
People have 
Yes.

They haven't been here!
There's been nobody here!
Come and have a look!
Cos everything is, as I left it!
How long do I keep that for?
Somebody else been here,.
This water heater is not to be used as it failed to reach the er  oh well I  now!
Wait, and I'll go and find out!
That's for the bed  er  television and the microwave.
This  and the water heater.
And ask her about the water heater cos if I can't take a shower I will stink!
Funny way of running business any how!
Look at him with the bloody roll in the window!
Oh .
But er, Danny says that they said that they were
People had been in!
overflowing!
Yes I know, but he  he said people are in last week!
But that's what  
They're overflowing with bookings for the summer!
Oh!
And now?
Yeah, cos they could have three times as many caravans!
By June  they'd let them go!
They're overflowing with them!
Not now!
Of course, you see, it's you that's using the caravan this week so they can come here  they  can they?
No.
Somebody comes quick and wants the caravan  they're supposed to be there ready!
Oh!
Ooh the sun is warm!
Can you feel it?
Is it the sun  or is it this  heater ?
You can just see 
Oh I dunno, maybe 
the sun!

Oh, and he's taking Tarzan for a walk!
Is that Sally?.
Mm?
Who's with her?

Now  erm Mrs  and I  down the caravan park.
Right.
Yeah, they were .
But people were in last week!
Mm.
Erm,.
What?
Cos I came down!
And I  cos I was amazed they told me about this salt   rubbish!
So I did it  and bowls are full of water!
I was shocked!
And then, I thought well I gosh this caravan isn't   is it because the salt had gone?
I i , it could be because it feels quite cold and damp .
Anyway  there's er  there's no !
There's no television in there!
Right.
There's  and there's a big sign on the water heater  it's not to be used!
Right..
And I said we are going back home!
Er  would you

She said she's trying to find it.
Suppose we  better go back home!
Going in the shop first.
Why is it?
She's got no excuse!
I'll go down there first.
To tell them not to mess about with that water heater!
 Ohhh She didn't know!
I said well when I was here last  that sign wasn't on the  thing then!
Don't forget!
And I'll put them back in  the back .

That's the more important thing!
She said, she didn't know but she getting somebody down here now!
So we still don't know whether that's gonna be operational!
Because, according to B S standards
Yes.

Right!

I don't know!
And she's getting somebody down now!

And erm 
Hey!
some of them of failed, and if they fail you have to pay so much.
You have to pay so much anyway to have it changed.
But, as I say, we've been very unhappy about it!
We had erm  notes through about  Out of 
 
ten pillows, seven needed replacing and we needed a new milk saucepan, a new frying pan, a new ashtray

things were done well that's a matter of .
Oh it'd be better for him to put that fire on at night time  and go over in the morning and switch it off.
Well  be at work before he can be out of bed probably, in the morning.
Have to .
And if he's gonna walk to Tenby they could be starting when he's in Tenby.
Well Sally will be there.
Well Sally'll go with him.
Yeah?
I mean if, if he forgets Sally could remind him.
Two of them.
If those men wasn't going there I would say right, put the gas fire on.
Put it on low and leave it the night and day cos it was left on for a week once wasn't it?
Mm.
Oh god that was, that was  at er  the flat.
Left on for a fortnight.
Oh and it was a cold day.
But it was in  August or the end of September or someth er er the beginning of September  and it was a chilly day but it was still summer.
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't terribly cold.
But we went home and I remember going in the room, I opened the door and  oh it's lovely and warm in here!
So I stood by the door  I wait till dad come in cos he was the last out  and it was always my fault like, I would have left the fire on not him.
So I stood by the door and I never moved till he went in   oh he said  But with a caravan I don't know.
Mm they're not very powerful grates are they?
Dunno   Oh nan he says, get Mark 
Is, is yours a  heater?
Mm?
Is yours a a long and 
Well you either put one bar on  or the lot is on  or it's very dim like this is low and you can't see it at all.
There's no heat from it.
You want something that gives heat 
There is heat.
But you can't see it.
Oh.
But you want to air them beds, you want to dry them beds.
I mean you've got to have heat there.
Well Danny says get Mark and bung them in the bloody car and bring it home.
the best thing  you want to stick it in the room and put a   heater .
Well we could put it in the spare bedroom.
Put it up against the radiator.
Mm.
But if someone's going there next week, that's  two beds, three beds.
You could put them in the sitting room.
And put the heater on there, put the fire on there.
Mm.
Well I dunno.
I do like this.
I'm afraid I 
You don't have to.
Have a drink and it disappears.
Oh I dunno  
And there isn't the flavour in it that used to be.
And this is Marks and Spencers?
Mm.
There's a  you know they used to put  I suppose vanilla essence or some of these  no almond would it be?
Mm.
I don't know.
There used to be a lot more taste on it though than there is on that one anyway.
Well if he's going down there tomorrow why can't he bring them back?
Well I suppose he could.
I have to say it would help him.
I suppose they're  I suppose they're worrying him?
They want something done about it.
Well I wouldn't bloody .
No way.
That thing on top of that mattress, the thing that doesn't fit  who's is that?
Oh theirs.
Dunno.
Belongs to the caravan
Yeah.
Well that's what I mean, belongs to the caravan.
Why was it stuck on the bed?
Because that is the mattress for the bed that folds away in the sitting room.
Right?
But it seems to me to be a foam thing.
It is.
And it's covered in a, in a  po polythene would you say?
Plastic  or what it is covered?
Cloth.
Cos you couldn't put that by the fire.
Yeah.
It would melt.
It's a cloth cover on it.
But I bet it's plastic inside it.
It's like these cushions isn't it?
It's foam.
Yes.
Foam.
But why was it so damp and cold here then?
Because it's wet and it's damp.
Well plastic doesn't hold the damp.
It isn't plastic, it's foam!
Well the foam, it doesn't
Oh god, yes.
Well you couldn't put them in the car could you?
What?
The mattresses.
Mm?
Well I've put the big one in but I know that the rest wouldn't go in.
Mm.
But then the little bedroom wasn't so  didn't seem so damp.
But you didn't try it did you, really?
In that caravan  a caravan's a caravan, call it what you like  but in that caravan that Mark is in  there was that little  room where the w hot water heater is
Mm.
and there was a hole er on the floor over there with a grating on it that was  you could see through to the ground.
Mm.
Well if  through the winter months  when there's no fire in there, no nothing in there  the damp is bound to be coming through there.
Fog gets in.
Course it does.
All caravans are like that.
But you've got to have those caravan, those vents because the van is so small and you've got gas supplied.
It's rules and regulations.
If you've got a gas fire in  
It it means that they haven't been doing their duty in the winter then.
If they guarantee to put the mattresses all up  in the dry  they asked you to do yours  or did they say they would do it?
They done it.
Well how's the damn thing on the bed then?
Because they put it back there for these people  that was coming in.
Oh.
They didn't seemingly.
We don't know.
Do we?
No.
Well there were no  there anyway.
So they say.
It's all hearsay.
Well alright.
Perhaps the man was working part-time.
Perhaps he never noticed the .
Perhaps the people were in the van  and found the beds wet and said well we can't sleep here and they slept in the sit with the fire on.
I dunno.
It could have been.
cos there was only two here.
cold weather in any case.
Eh?
It's cold weather in any case.
That's right.
Shut the lights.
You don't know.
Mm.
So you can't swear to that then.
No.
That, that they weren't there.
You can't, no.
And then again alright, the fire was condemned on the sixth.
Well those people were only there from Tuesday to Friday.
And the sixth was a Friday.
So it could have been condemned as they were going.
Oh.
I don't know.
Neither have I.
That's why I 
But er anyway if Danny's, if if Mark is there now  he can bring one home today and then he can bring the others tomorrow.
Er it's only the two little ones.
If there are two little ones there.
Yeah.
If there are two little ones there.
If they're big enough for  for Susan's two boys.
And and one for  
Well their girls have gotta sleep in them.
Mm.
Er it's only one big one and two little ones.
Well then you might as well push that little thing in as well mightn't you?
Oh yes.
And bring them home.
But Mark won't be there when you take them back.
Well he says he's going to the, he said he was going to the  on Friday and they would be  finished by Friday.
And he was going to see that it was finished by Friday.
Mm.
Well you could take them back on Friday.
Mhm yeah, I could take them back Friday.
How am I gonna get them in the van?
What van?
In, back into the caravan.
On me own.
Oh.
It's a double mattress, a double bedded mattress.
I can't bloody lift that.
So the only thing that I would suggest is to
Well still Mark will be  there.
Or he could come down with you on Saturday?
Or Sally maybe would be able to come down with you Saturday and help you?
Unless we went over the same day that Susan went over.
And kept the mattresses till Susan goes.
But the understanding is  that like Mark has got the caravan this week.
Mm.
But if they had a booking to go into it, Mark's gotta get out.
Oh well he could ring you up and you could take them back down but at least they would be dried.
Cos if anybody  who could they come on if they caught cold and and
Well I dunno.
You or him?
I dunno.
It's like fighting a losing battle isn't it?
If someone else 
I wouldn't worry at all.
I wouldn't hesitate.
It's an embarrassment for people to come in and catch cold and think it's your mattresses that's done it.
Mm.
If those men were not working on the gas I would go over there now, and I'd switch the fire and I'd leave it on.
Mm.
Yes.
The thing is old Mark is there to see to it.
Mark won't be there to see to it?
Why?
Because  how does M Mark know?
Mark right, he's got up this morning and he's gone to Tenby.
And he's gone to look around Tenby.
While he's gone those men have gone in there.
That's what I mean.
He can't be standing there watching the bloody thing all the time.
No.
But he could put a note on it.
Please leave this fire on.
Please do not touch this fire.
Well they've got to haven't they?
To disconnect the gas.
Oh I thought it was water problems.
Gas.
A gas water heater!
Oh.
They've gotta disconnect the gas to get the water heater off the wall.
And fix it to the 
Well Mark will be back there tonight and he can switch it on when he comes home.
Make it his responsibility.
Oh you don't understand!
In the meantime  the men have took the water heater off the wall.
They've put it from that wall, and they've stuck it on to this wall.
Oh let's connect it up  see if it works.
Now in the meantime there's gas seeping through that fire there with no light.
Oh.
So you've blown your caravan.
Well then again, there's Mark and Sally.
You could take the mattresses and put them in their caravan in the spare bedroom.
Is there a spare bedroom?
Well no.
Cos Mark's going in one, Sally's going in the other.
Oh bring them home then.
Bring them home and tell them that you're taking them home to air.
And I don't suppose, they're not wet  you see.
It's different  it's, they're damp  it's different if there'd been a hole and the water was coming in.
They're not saturated.
No.
It won't take them long.
That's what I says.
If those men wasn't working there I wouldn't hesitate.
The fire would go on and I'd leave it on low
Mm.
and the atmosphere would warm up  right through the caravan.
Mm.
But I'd hump them into the sitting room.
If those men came there on Tuesday
Mm.
and done their work  and Mark rang me here and said, on Tuesday  the caravan's great now, the fires are alright.
I'd go straight over there and switch the fires on.
Mm.
Well I'd even tell him to go down only he ain't got the keys.
Cos they're not going to take an awful long time in a good hot room  to dry.
the only thing again that I'm thinking of  what if we gets them out of the caravan  and we gets them into the car and we're getting them in and out here  and then we gets them back into the car to take them back over and in to the caravan, what if we rip the bloody things?
Well if we rip them we rip them and I'll mend them.
Mm.
They are yours aren't they?
Mm.
Put a patch on them.
Then she turned round and she said, I said to her those beds are soaking, I said.
There's nobody can sleep in those.
Yes, she said but er when I went down there to check after you'd gone, she said  erm  yours was erm  the driest of them sort of thing.
Suppose they didn't bother with them.
And I said 
Didn't bother with them.
See they're alright.
I said then  well I said from the time now, I said  there is nobody I said, can sleep on those mattresses.
No she said, it does take a while for caravans to dry out.
Well  say what you were saying 
So in other words  you don't go to the caravan.
. Let it be their responsibility, they put them in there.
Well Mark's going in at his own risk, see?
They sold them to you complete.
So?
So they're yours.
What's the good of a bed  a bed without a mattress?
I'm talking about the mattresses.
What are you talking about?
The caravan!
Well I thought you was talking about mattresses airing in front of the fire.
Well that subject's gone!
Oh well
I'm saying  that  Park, what the woman said that she went down to check the vans  last summer
Mm.
end of last summer.
long time since then .
And to see that the salt was there and the mattresses were up and that was great.
And she went down to check in the winter time and she said your van was really dry.
Oh.
Well it all depends how she checked.
perhaps.
Well then they then they went and put the mattresses back  in their places.
Now the mattresses are soaking.
Mm.
And I said there's nobody can go and sleep on those mattresses.
And she said well it does take a time for the vans to dry out.
Mm.
Not until the sun comes hot and heavy on it.
So whoever goes there, to anybody's van, that's what they're getting.
Oh well, I should take advantage now Mark is in, bring the damn things from there.
Then you can get him to help you take them back on Friday.
I think we'd have to ring them up and let them know what we're doing.
Well go in office and tell them.
You can talk  personally better than on the phone.
Cos they are your mattresses aren't they?
When you take them back they're there for their inspection.
Unless you  you  take electric blanket down?
Put it on, oh  You can't put that on a damp bed can you?
Not really.
Don't think so.
Not 
Well they are protected.
What?
Er er electric blankets.
Don't know.
They're built er pretty, pretty good that way I think.
I don't know what about the lags for the wall  
And another thing, I didn't even look in Mark's room.
Was there pillows and blankets and quilts in his  caravan?
I didn't look.
Well perhaps Sally had a hunt 
Dunno.
Oh well   Well I dunno I think I'll go and wash me hair.
It's desperate for it.
I've gotta have a bath in the morning.
tomorrow.
Is it?
Well I'm not bound to, no.
What?
Have a bath tomorrow.
Well you can have one .
Good god, you can have one now if you want it.
 

 

I hope  you know I'd er  see he'll have to put the back seat of the car down into a van.
Shit I'm afraid in case those mattresses rip.
Mm?
Because they're so thin.
Well  I'll mend the buggers  for you .
And don't be afraid of a patch dear.
It's not that I'm afraid of a patch.
Are caravan sizes the same as everyday sizes?
The beds, the big beds are.
The small beds aren't.
Well you can get erm two foot bunk beds nan.
Mm.
But they're not spring mattresses.
Mm.
Although what's on the bed is nice mattresses.
Oh what's  have you got his dinner?
Yes.
Oh.
Bloody cheek, do him the world of good to go without for a day or two.
He won't eat it.
Well that's it, he he 
It's treating him like a kid of  five or six year old isn't it?
He forgets that he
Well the thing is he doesn't have a dinner every day of the week.
It won't hurt him.
Lots of people don't have one at all.
And then he looks forward to the weekends and that.
He had dinner yesterday before he went.
So that's his weekend dinner.
If he was in living in a flat by himself he wouldn't be having one at all.
Well I don't imagine, unless he went out for it.
Fish and chips at night is it, his dinner?
Look at the ruddy traffic.
Mm.
Oh  held up.
Oh the lights have come higher up now.
Oh.
It's Sunday today.
There's more transport on the road I expect.
The lights have been moved up the road.
Oh.
I don't like the glass in those windows.
Where?
Coloured glass isn't it?
Yeah.
Don't look right somehow.
Still, net curtains on them.
Eh?
When you've net curtains on them.
There are four niggers in there.
Mm?
Four niggers in that .
Mm.
Oh  god.
Now I need the key .
Mm?
Gonna need the key for this.
the west end of London.
The east end I think.
East end then.
Oh he's got a nice shirt on.
in a pub he was, got drunk and for a twenty pound bet shaved off all his hair.


I still owe him the money.
But he is stupid cos he went hitchhiking once and left a day early to avoid traffic.


Here, do you know what I fancy?
I fancy an icecream.
She said well I'll go and get you one.
He said no, you know what your memory's like, you're bound to forget.
She said no I won't, what do you fancy?
He said well  I fancy  vanilla and strawberry icecream with chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, crushed nuts and a flake.
She said right, vanilla and strawberry icecream, chocolate sauce, crushed nuts.
said right, I shall be back in five minutes.
Two hours later she come back with a ham sandwich.


He said you silly cow!
You forgot the mustard.


East end.
This week on handy hints we are talking fishing.
I once went for a job as a fisherman.
The boss said Connolly you've got the job, you start on Monday.
I said that sounds alright, could I have a sub?
He said no you're on a fishing boat like everybody else.


Well one of the greatest qualities a fisherman can have is of course patience.
And you can spend the whole day without a bite.
As for me, I always take my packed lunch.
And pot noodles is one of my favourite dishes.
No.
 

I don't think  that the pub is open  the cafs aren't open  the amusements aren't open.
The bar's open.
No.
All locked up and in darkness.
?
We went there, had a look.
Perhaps they'll open at night time.
Dunno.
When he asked me when they opened.
I don't know I said.
And what time do they shut?
And I said I don't know but I said I shouldn't think it would be too late.
I dunno.
And er 
Did he eat the dinner?
Well I dunno.
I left it there and then  went down the caravan.
When we come back he'd got the dishes all ready for me.
So you don't know if he ate it or not?
No  the dishes .
Mm?
She gave me a key.
Mm.
She told me here's your keys now she said because you've lost a set.
You didn't tell her any different did you?
Well why didn't you tell me ?
I did tell you!
I told you yesterday.
You told me they'd got a set of keys.
What's happened?
So she give me a set of keys.
And?
And erm  I give them to Mark.
Aye.
And I told him I want them back, don't take them to the office.
So  what did they say about you keeping them on??
I went in there again and I told her that you'd rung and some  Angela from sales  Andrea, we haven't got an Andrea she said.
So she said somebody else it could have been.
I said I don't know I said.
Angela 
No.
I don't know.
But erm  she said  she has said that we could do this and she said that's fine, she said.
As long as you don't  as long as you don't put erm anything too near it.
Mm.
And I said Mark's here so that he can switch it  switch it off at nights.
So anyway while I was there  Darren came in.
Is everything alright?
He said.
Are all the jobs done?
And I said well look I said, I've got to come  because I said there's no way anybody  I said I wouldn't do it myself, I wouldn't put anybody in those beds.
I said something's got to be done and it won't wait.
And I said I'm going to leave the fire on  and er Mark's here and he'll switch it off at night.
That's alright she said.
Let's see she said,th when's the first  when's your first booking?
Not until, I think she said April twenty first.
Yeah that comes under the  bookings.
That's our first booking, paid booking.
Nothing about these ones that's already been in.
We're there
Susan is there  she said the twenty first and I  on the twenty first.
But she wouldn't be on their books like that would it?
Well she'd be on a form, yes.
That's the twenty first of March.
Yes.
Well perhaps she was talking about Sue then.
I don't know.
I didn't really stop to find out.
And er  she said that'll be alright.
And Mark's there, I said he'll switch it off at night.
Fine she said, as long as there's nothing left too near the fire.
So I took the envelope off those tickets and I tore that up and wrote down and I stuck it in the  water heater that the sitting room fire may be on, please check.
I put another one then on the draining board.
Cos if they're going to fix it round the sink, he doesn't know where they're gonna put it.
You know, while I was there Darren came in.
And he said er have all the jobs been done yet?
And I said well no I said there's some water I said.
Mark's on holiday this week I said.
they've put him in another.
Oh that's right he said.
I heard something about this he said, er  I was on holidays  all last week he said but erm  it's bloody lies cos I saw him last week.
And he said erm  yeah he said cos we've gotta pay this he said because it's all in the guarantee.
In the warranty.
And he came in and I said and the mirror on the dressing table isn't done.
You know and  that's gone and I said feel these beds I said.
They're soaking wet.
And he felt them and he said they are a bit he said.
So I said well I  Danny rang this morning and he got permission to put the fire on  and put them, I'm going to move them all into the  front  and erm to air them up.
And I said there's no way anybody can sleep in there.
That's alright he said.
And he checked and then he went  So I took the bags off the pillows in case they were sweating in the bags and I put them out on the seats.
I put the quilts all out on the seats.
And .
Because there's eight  there's er   seven, there's eight pillows then and
He's done nothing.
Yeah.
He 
 

Mm?
The girl in the coun the girl behind the counter, the little tiny one.
Small and 
She's still there?
tiny.
Yes.
She said how's Danny then?
And I said oh he's at home I said  this week I said and that oh and she said  well tell him to get over here and we'll sort him out.
I said eh  I said when Danny comes in he'll sort you out.
And she laughed about it.
Darren said you know the girls in the  were saying that you weren't well, how was you and   one of these days.
I don't know what this is all for.
Well they th th the kids were there but  
And he said will you be there?
And I said well I don't know.
You should have said yes, we're gonna try to.
That's why I got the tickets.
It depends now how er  mm I don't know.
tea?
he enjoyed it for forty years.
two thousand five hundred pounds.
Oh.
He made a mistake.
You know, if there's nothing like the  last week then  Did you have your tea Danny?
I had one piece of butter and jam.
I can't take them tablets till I've eaten something.
Oh.
No empty stomachs.
No.
So 
Terrible.
that was at four o'clock, I had to take a tablet.
Mm.
 
Well Mark is quite contented where he is.
Sally said the caravan he's in is a lot better than mine.
Ooh it's out of this world.
I mean you can't compare it can you?
And the bedrooms!
You can't compare it, it's the rolls royce of caravans.
That's, that Darren said oh aye, he's the one, he's in the maroon one he said.
He's in the rolls royce.
Top of the range he said.
Beautiful thing.
Good god there's a mirror in the sitting room as big as that wall.
You'll see it when you go over there.
Beautiful thing.
Yes,
And I said I've bought a box of matches for him to go down and light this fire  thinking you know he might need two or three matches at a time.
But er  well I gave him a box of matches to go with him and I thought oh well  he'll have plenty of matches then.
And I took them in, he says  what do you buy them for?
He said.
I've got loads of matches.
In this caravan everything's electronic.
Fridge, light switches ooh  beautiful thing it is.
Ten times the price of ours I expect.
A caravan is a caravan after all, isn't it?
But for what we want it for  ours is good enough.
Good enough.
That's what I'm saying perhaps  they must let it out though.
If we were having 
Why's Malcolm got it?
if we were having a caravan like that, I'd be too frightened to let it.
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't 
Well there we are.
let it.
There we are.
I couldn't afford to pay for it then could I?
No.
He's right up by the wishing wheel  well  or whatever it is.
You know this reproduction furniture?
And the little lead windows?
That's got it all inside it.
And the shower hasn't got a curtain it's got a big black door.
is it?
No.
the shower is.
Quite a few people there today.
Whether it was the fine weather bringing them out or   yesterday.
Lot of owners where down checking it see.
Eh?
Lot of owners were down  checking them.
Mm.
They were .
You could see the mattresses all under the sheet.
And they were cleaning the windows and  washing the box 
I would do that next year.
Mm?
Mm.
I'd do that next year.
We never saw that old girl trudging round today.
The  life of a caravan isn't long is it?
Not  we've got.
When we bought it he told me I'd have at least ten years because the make of it is  it's a good make.
And the make has got a lot to do with it.
Oh.
And what is the make of it?
Doesn't know why you let it like you do.
You'll get kids in it running and jumping and wrestling about.
And this woman said that she stated no animals.
But she said they tell you that and she said they tell you, it's on computer she said, but animals do go in the vans.
Well I can tell you one thing, animals will not go into ours.
And I tell you she's got a different contract with me altogether.
You read our contract didn't you, last night?
It's there in black and white.
Mm I know, that's what she said.
I don't how she knows.
If I, if if I found out there was animals in our caravan, I'd take them to town.
But how do you know if you're not there every second?
You  you for one, like her, when you went to the caravan, you'd smell it like that.
Oh I .
But you'd smell it wouldn't you?
Mm.
And they know this.
Cos there are dogs there, great big ones.
Yeah.
Mm big white ones.
That   that man yesterday, he paid six thousand pound for his caravan.
He s he said that on the tape.
Mhm.
I listened to the tape with her last night.
He paid six thousand pound.
We paid fourteen thousand seven hundred for ours.
Mm.
He hasn't got, ours is a gold golden olympic.
He's not having the rent we're having.
No.
He's got a .
He hasn't got a brand new caravan.
But he nearly gave six thousand pound for it.
That's what they said though.
Yeah I know.
I know they said it.
I heard them.
But a new caravan starts from eleven thousand eight hundred.
That's the price of a new one.
I know they're as good as a house almost.
Well he said on that tape, I gave them a fat cheque of six thousand pounds.
Mm.
Well that isn't bloody  half of what we paid.
Yeah I'm paying for mine monthly, but I won't disturb fourteen thousand seven hundred.
Perhaps perhaps he's got a  an agreement.
Like perhaps he bought the ground and the caravan, and then they had an agreement that er   Stone Park would er  b you know let it, be responsible for when they let it or something.
Yeah.
See  there's different contracts altogether there.
Mm.
I mean he  she was going on that tape about she had to replace some things.
Mm.
She had  well I've got nothing like that.
No.
If something is gone  they replace it.
That's part of the contract.
Well everything had gone on the  one.
Well
Dishes and  furniture and 
Pillows.
everything was ripped out or destroyed.
Pillows.
Well
She had to pay for eight pillows.
Mm.
We've had no bills like that.
We were asked if we wanted to do the chassis.
And  she was so toffee-nosed as if they said  the curtains.
Oh yes I'll have them c gotta have them done.
And and probably said they'd maintain the thing for her  at a price.
Well at a price yeah.
I mean  they don't do nothing for nothing.
No of course not.
They're out to get money, aren't they?
It's their living.
But when we had these things through for the chassis and the cleaning of the caravan, it was all optional.
If I, if you wanted to go down there and scrub the van out, you go and scrub it out.
You go and do it.
And it saves
And I will next year.
it saves thirty five pounds.
Mm.
But for that thirty five pounds  the carpets are shampooed, the seats are shampooed, the lot.
Were they in today?

Yes, it's could be like Thomas  shop.
He has it for so long.
Oh I don't know.
Mm.

And then you've gotta go.
You've gotta put in tenders for it then.
Cos they must make a bomb though.
Unless Stone Park has got it.
Cos a lot of stuff isn't in.
They could be put a manager in and   the benefits.
I suppose they would.
Mm.
Perhaps they do.
And then there's staff there to run it.

No.
He bought the Saturday one that's got the week  part in it.
Why didn't he come over and fetch the car then?
Because he said there's no point, I don't want it.
Well I've got to take his over now, he'll have to bring me back.
Yeah.
What I was going to tell him, if he was to come over, take my car there  when I'd have taken this car over, I would have had a car to come back.
Well that's what he said.
He said you'd better keep the car there in case his won't be ready or something.
Mm.

has had to tear up its election coverage plans because tory ministers are scared to meet top industrialists .
Mm.
Top industrialists, those are big business boys.
Chancellor Norman Lamont and treasury ministers were told  er  chancellor Norman Lamont and treasury ministers were to be grilled like labour spokesmen by a panel of businessmen  and just one union leader .
But there was to be  Norman Lamont and a tr and treasury ministers, three or four of them.
And there was to be the big industrialists, three or four of them.
Same as labour was done the other day.
But the tories 
 
but the tories have scrapped agreed plans claiming the panel is not politically balanced.
The B B C two programme is regularly pr presented by Peter Jay who's Panorama Special on the slump was controversially axed last week .
They're not willing to stand up  see erm  er what's it, Richard Dimbleby  was it Richard  or the other one?

Jonathon, Dick
No.
What's his name?
The other boy.
There's two boys alive.
David?
Mm.
I don't know one from the other  by name.
But the one was at him yesterday and he, well he didn't know what to say next.
He did quiz him.
That's David.
Is it?
On a Sunday.
Well  And, and er  Lamont even said  that er unemployment would get higher.
He even said so yesterday  
Can't get no bloody higher can it?
Oh it could.
Twenty two percent VAT if the tories get back.
Mm.
Jobless er tory jobless figures were exposed yesterday as a fraud.
The official unemployment total of  two  two million six hundred  and four thousand one hundred  is more than a million short of the real figure  because the tories have found  thirty ways not to count jobless people .
That right?
They say unless you've been unemployed six months you're not unemployed.
You're looking for a job.
They don't call it unemployed.
Well you can't go on the list for six weeks anyway.
Six months.
six weeks, yeah.
Well if you haven't been working for six months you are looking for a job, you are not unemployed.
They don't call that unemployment.
Course this is all  voting   propaganda again.
I mean when is it  it's a disgrace to the social service workers isn't it?
To make them wear uniform.
They're getting them like prison officers and policeman and 
Well it's the same as anywhere else.
If you work in Marks and Spencers you wear er their uniform.
If you work in the hospital you wear their uniform.
Yeah.
That's only to advertise the place though isn't it?
Marks and Spencers and 
It isn't.
If you went into your Clarke's shoe shop they've all got the same clothes.
It's it makes it so easy that  the staff, one can't dress any better than the other.
They're all equal.
When you go to places like  in the big stores  the staff have all got the same type of apron er overall.
And that's for the customer, if it needs help they know who is who to go for advice.
Yeah.
That's all it is.
But when you've got people stood behind a desk and serving you and doing nothing but serving you as you come.
They'll be wanting bank clerks to have uniforms next.
Good god bank clerks have been wearing uniforms for these last three four five years.

Not at all.

Each bank's different.
Well they've had them for years.
Well in the Midland Bank and they were wearing them the last time you were there.
The electric board wears them.
The gas board wears them.
Woolworths wear them.
Mm.
And so really it is no different, just that they are making a song about it.
But there's no need to go to that prices.

You can have the firm's name and give them a brooch or something.
Well they've got them anyway, haven't they?
But  Val was on about it last summer.
They was talking about it then.
But she said that they had been so many months  or when everybody else had a pay rise they only had a little bit.
And the extra that they should have had is going to pay for these uniforms.
Oh.
didn't want the uniforms.
Well a percentage is taken out of your money for them.
There's no doubt about that.
Mm.
Well that's what she was on about that, and and they was  they were going 
Well everybody has got to do that.
to go on strike because of it.
And really, it would be a good thing for Val.
Why?
Well she's gotta pay so much for her bloody clothes.
She makes her own, a lot of them.
She's still gotta buy the material.
Well she would rather have her own than be dressed up like  looking like rolled doll she said.
Cos they were all on about it.
They were talking about going on strike over it, about it anyway.
Is it going to rain?
Mm.
Could have the odd little shower.
No er tonight it's supposed to rain.

Or do you want me to take my caravan off here?
He said why?
I said because I feel I'm being .
I said I'm not getting a fair square deal here.
I said and not only I think that, other people on the site think so.
He asked me if I could wait five minutes.
when I'm in there.
And Darren was on a day off and he's been .
And Darren come in  spoke to me and he says  oh I  Danny.
I said no you bloody won't.
You'll get in that office with me.
I said I want him in there.
He sold me the caravan.
And I went in there.
I says now  have you had any visitors from   a couple of nights in my caravan.

And making accusations.
And you were making accusations?
Yeah.

And he wanted to know what steps he could take.
Well Danny wanted to know if it was true.
So they asked  they wanted to know how, how we got the tape.
So I showed him that letter you had.
Mm.
And he asked me to a ask you to  when they ra give the tape back  if they could possibly supply a copy of it, of that tape  to them.
In the meantime he's gotta write to these people.
They know the people.
Mm?
To instruct them that their caravan must be taken off within twenty eight working days.
They know the people who were talking?
Yeah.
I said they would.
Mm?
And the caravan must be taken off within twenty eight working days.
Well I think it was taken off this morning.
No, it's still there.
Cos I saw that er bloke in er  park landrover.
Oh you saw him that day didn't you?
Well they're moving and hunting caravans all the time Mark.
They're on the roadways  
Yeah well he he said he said
No I'm talking about I saw, actually saw that guy who's in our caravan
Oh yeah?

And all of a sudden three big juggernauts came into the camp and one of them was on the back of a truck.
They they they 
Well er er sh 
they took three off the site.
Did
She said she couldn't take it off.
No, he 
 
Maybe it wasn't him then.
I just thought it looked like him.
He told me it was still there and that he'd been told he's got to write to them today  and they've got to get it taken off within twenty eight days.
Yeah.
Cos she was trying to find a, a reason  or an excuse  to sue them for it.
She stated that.
Mm.
It's all on the thing.
Mm.
And he said how can they do that?
Is it in the law?
They don't break the law.
They can't afford to break the law.
No well
But you can understand that.
The thing is Danny is that they said they'd only bought the thing in July.
Well the, the, the camp is closed 
Yes.
in, in
In October, end of October.
so that was only er July to September 
Don't give them time for the 
to October.
Yeah well what they bought
Hardly two months.
was an eight year old caravan they bought
Oh brand new.
No.
Eight year old.
Six thousand pound 
Brand new she told us.
But it isn't, it's eight year old.
Brand new she told us.
That's why
Emphatically.
she had to supply the blankets and dishes and everything else.
Oh!
Coming round now aren't we?
That's what she told us, brand new.
She's looking for batter.
Does it say that on your  brand new?
Said it didn't it.
No, he just said he paid six thousand pound  on the tape, for the caravan.
Which was true.
Yeah.
Well does it say on the tape that it was brand new?
No.
Because they repeated that several times.
No, what she said was that we spent er no he said  I gave a fat cheque for the caravan.
And then he said six thousand pounds.
And he said of course the site fees are in that.
First part of the year actually.
Yes.
Yes well even so, if they bought it say the middle of July, there's July to September to October.
Er they weren't in it three months.
They didn't have it until the camp closed.
Three months.
They wouldn't have had it long enough to clear their own ground rent.
Expenses like 
Well apart from the cleaning and all that and getting a bit of profit.
Well we bought ours in August  and we had enough to clear the profit.
Yes but it was already bookings from the year before weren't it?
Mm.
It wasn't ours.
Plus the fact their bookings wouldn't be as much as yours if it's an eight year old caravan.
Mm.
No.
But you'd have thought by her that it was immaculate.
It was a luxury thing, yeah.
No.
It was eight year old.


Wonderful how you  isn't it ?
Yeah.
This man  this Mr  wants to meet you, to apologize to you
 

 

Oh.
whatever.
For the  discomfort, the upset that you went through  with having to listen to her.
While I was there Mr  was the other side of the counter.
But we enjoyed ourselves didn't we?
We enjoyed it.
And he just dived into the bloody office.
When you were in the caravan.
No.
this people.
With the fire?

If I knew where it had come from I would do it.

See if it was warmer and dryer, I'd go out there and I'd rake that  lawn.
Yeah.
Cut it short and I'd rake hell out of it.
Yeah.
And then I would pour moss killer over it.
Then you've gotta rake it again.
Well I I think it's a whole summer's job isn't it?
Well how else can you get rid of it?
No, well it is.
To clean a lawn like that, is a whole summer's job.
You've gotta rake it
Yeah.
and rake it and rake it.
Then nobody else'll do it, so I've gotta do it.
And even if you dig it up  turn it over and start again  that moss is in it isn't it?
That's it.
The seeds are there.
No I would say it's er  it's er bunging the ground up.
It's not aerating the ground at all.
You know the  the air can't get into the ground  to let the grass grow.
It'll just take over.

I dunno.
I've gotta read about it.

The first thing they asked him was how much money he'd got!
Yes.
And, do you belong to Bupa?

Elderly patients cower in terror as two nurses battle it out on a ward!
A tribunal heard yesterday.
Tempers exploded at breakfast time after Rosemary   and  Carssier who had feuded for a month accidentally bumped into each other between two beds  and their slanging match  to violence  when Rosemary shouted   what you need is a man!
Bed ridden patients at St Mary's A St Mary Abbots Hospital  are geriatric and   and psychiatric unit in London's Kensington  narrowly escaped injured  injury as five foot two   Carssier grappled with Rosemary  six foot and well stoned!
And it was Rosemary who finished  up in casualty after  Carssier kicked her three times in the stomach!


The ides industrial tribunal in Chelsea was   the fight ended only when they were pulled apart  by the angry matron!
Rosemary, twenty eight, claimed  that  Carssier grabbed a patient's  organ  no  angry Rosemary, twenty eight, claimed that  Carssier grabbed a patient's orange juice  threw it over her and kicked her!
But  Carssier thirty two  insisted she only tried to defend herself after Rosemary repeatedly punched her!
Rosemary who had a caesarian operation just four months earlier, said  she did not touch  Carssier She told the tribunal, just look at me!
If I had touched her it might have been a very different thing!
Simon , ex-manager of St Mary's  Mary Abbots, said  the safety of patients was put at risk!
 Cassier of Notting Hill  so she's a black-un!
Was sacked by Riverside Health Authorities  after disciplinary hearing.
She claims unfair dismissal .
 Cassier's the white one!
Oh yeah.
From Notting Hill.
She claims unfair dismissal  and the case continues .
So  Mm!

He got together with the T V presenter  when she opened a half size replica  of Sleeping Beauty's castle at Battersea Park, in London  the castle, giving visitors  a preview of the Euro-Disney Centre  which opens near Paris  on April the twelfth.
See they're still saying April the twelfth.
Will stay at the park until Sunday  before moving on to Birmingham and Manchester .
Oh yes, well I dare say  isn't finished!
It might be finished all but from painting and  you know?
Extra trimmings.
I mean, they're working there forever and a day!
Fergies twenty million kiss-off.
The Duchess of York  will be ordered to  .
It was I, it was in the book, Fergie and .
She can't do it!
She can't do it!
But if she opens it  gonna take her to the cleaners!
She'll get the house if   The Sunnin Sunninghill  the five million house, built  for the couple  at the Queen's expense  will remain Fergie's home for the  foreseeable future.
The Queen who gave it to Andy and Fergie as a wedding present  has made it clear to her advisors  that the Duchess should not be forced to leave, as long as the she adheres to her agreement  not to talk about the marriage break up .
But, a broke up's a broke up, innit?
Well she's been talking hasn't she?
The decision means the children will remain physically close to the queen  and Princess Beatrice will be able to remain at the same school.
The house is not regarded as a ac architectural masterpiece!
It is nicknamed Southyork  because of it's resemblance to R J Ewing's ranch, Southfork  from the soap opera, Dallas!
The house is like a fortress behind eight  foot walls  and set in four acre grounds.
Various critics  have likened it to a Tesco's superstores!
The little chef  and a glorified council house!
It has  pseudo-Tudor beams  no expense spared furnishings, including a dome glass roof  in the entrance hall  and vast main function room with a marble fireplace  and a galleried landing .
Musicians gallery, innit?
The house has twenty five rooms including  special quarters for the Queen  and the Duke of Edinburgh  and Charles and Diana.
It is multa and  it is mortar and bullet proof.
Outside is a twenty five foot  swimming pool and landscaped gardens .
I don't think Fergie would want to stay there.
It is like er  it is like 
She'll leave the country I think.
It is like Tesco's isn't it?
Mm.
Oh yes, she'll go probably, I should imagine.
The mul , and the Duchess of York will become a multi-millionairess, in her own right, as a result of the break up of the marriage to Andrew  we can reveal today .
Possible job, they can reveal it because it said in the  on the front page that  there's nothing been decided!
Mm.
Fergie will receive a mammoth payment of twenty millions pounds,!
Which will come out of the Duke's personal trust fund.
And another five  hundred thousand every year  paid for by the Queen!
This will more than insure that she can continue to live  in the style she's enjoyed since her marriage.
Quite separately, the two children, Princess Beatrice, three, and Princess Eugenie, two, have been independently looked after again by the Queen!
On their births a trust a fund  of tens of thousands of pound  was started for them in their names by their grandmother  .
This will guarantee all their school fees  and the basis of their future .
The huge down payment will come from a trust fund  of one million, set up by the Queen for Prince Andrew, the day he was born .
See, they've put that million pound into  into a fund for him and that's been getting  erm
Interest and interest on it.
twelve, twelve, thirteen, fourteen percent interest  a year!
And, you know  compound interest.
His sister and both brothers have identical trust funds  this million pound figure  has grown to the size, just today  around forty million  because Prince  because the Prince has not touched it  in all these years.
As Andrew's wife, Fergie can claim  half of everything he owns !
And they've given her half of it aren't they?
Mm.
Well everybody can do that.
Mhm.
Only it's just lucky that he's got a lot!
.Senior Buckingham Palace aid confirmed last night  the Duchess is entitled  to claim half the sum now  contained in that fund.
City experts had  calculated last night that the original million pound will be grown  with wise investment  to thirty eight and forty million.
In addition to this lump sum the annual   Of course, they don't pay tax!
In addition to this lump sum the annual half a million pound  allowance will be paid to the Duchess by the Queen  partly to ensure that she is never tempted  to publish memoirs  or talk about her failed marriage.
Such,shu shut up money  arrangements are never openly discussed, but the financial arrangements within the Duke and Duchess will include a contract  with a silent clause.
The senior aide said last night there will be carrot and stick clauses.
The Duchess will be told quite clearly  that if news or information gets out publicly  in any way  she could be fined, for example will be warned  that  time spent with her children will possibly be curtailed  if she doesn't tow the line .
And it goes on and all.
Well if she does  she can have the children taken off her!
Yeah.
Her time spent with the children.
So the Queen would hire a nanny to look after them 
Mm.
at Buckingham Palace, and she'd visit  occasionally.
Well they'd give them to her too.
Regular bills  include a household expenses  food, eating, a dress allowance  and the retention of two nannies  they've

Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is on the telly all the time  telling us he can't put his eye on a labour government  to be firm with Gadaffi of Libya  or sa or Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
So here I publish a picture of him ten years ago  when he was Junior Minister  he is enjoying a marvellous a party at London's  Intercontinental Hotel.
He's forced the Libyan government  a cause for celebration  the tenth anniversary of the coming to power  of their president  Colonel Gadaffi.
Mhm.
Previous year Mr Hurd  on behalf of the Foreign office was celebrating in the .
The great event, an anniversary 
 
of the coming of power  of the  the   dictatorship.
And who was top man in that dictat in that dictatorship  to which Iron Man Hurd raised his glass!
Saddam Hussein !
Mm.
didn't it?
Mm.
Mhm, and now they're trying to fight to get him from there!
Well now they are fighting!
I mean the , they've done it once a , and  didn't do it!
That's all creating him back up now isn't it?
He was given a, a week 
Ah, ah, ah, ah !
or a fortnight or something  to do something with their lot.
It isn't raining is it?
No, I don't think.
A bit foggy!
Dunno.
Well, let's hope this weather picks up for when Margaret gets here.


Or she'll be looking a bear skin!
And her super warm coat!
Oh yes !


Well i ah, I dunno.
Well she won't think it's cold because  I mean, it's sunny every day is it?
Well she couldn't of had it colder  than when dad was in hospital!
And by hell it was cold!
Bitter cold!
And wet!
And blowing!
You couldn't had it worst!
The only you could of had was the snow!
Ooh, but that was!
Well she shivered!
And she shivered!
Yeah !
Yeah, and what, new clothing  
 
 
and she said as, well what she used to say about it was nobody's business!
And I mean, if they get a we , a wet day isn't it just rainy in there, it's lovely and warm!
In there, well , but it isn't warm .
But it is to us who is used to this sodding weather!
We had lovely weather then!
And, and we only had a rain  on one day I think it was.
Er, you know, like a shower, one big shower.
Well normal shower.
And it must have been cold  bloody flat!
Mm.
Must of been, cos they'd been out all day.
No fire, no nothing on!
And then to go home, tired and cold in an empty place, and cold and  must of been terrible!
Oh I dunno if yo you  get into bed and the blanket was on,yo you know, you know?
She said she wasn't expecting to go out, out all day !
Well she erm  she can't remember exactly!
But I mean er  she knew 
But Rowan and her went on Boxing Day.
When did David and Pam go?
I've no idea.
Cos she didn't sleep here.
So they all must have gone out for the dinner.
So they must of stayed until erm  Boxing Day, Christmas Day rather.
Oh they're coming here for Christmas.
Wish they was.
.And they went on Boxing Day dinner.
They had their dinner and went!
I've no idea!
Not the foggiest!
Didn't they stay at the flat?
Somebody did!
Yeah, David and Pam and Margaret all slept at the flat!
And they must of come over for Christmas dinner.
Yes, because David tucked into his er  Christmas pudding!
He loved it!
And Pam was shouting about the bloody cholesterol!


And then they had Boxing Day dinner.
And David and Pam must have gone as well, cos  Margaret went with  Rowan.
Up Newtown way, they were going up to Ruth.
And 
Wonder where she got ?
I shall bloody quiz her about that!
And er  David and Pam must of gone the other way  you know, they'd gone their way home, and  had gone her way home.
But er  and then Astra was here and she was going bloody North!
She goes  ey and it's colder  up there !
Well she found it cold here and she .
Oh it was hysterical because it was blowing a gale!
Violet and me were over cleaning your flat.
That was the day you was taken into hospital  and she was in the bed, cos they were on their way down  so we were changing  the bloody beds!
And you come down through the alley way  and you could not keep your feet on the floor!
You could move!
And we'd got these bags,, I said  just bang all the sheets into bin bags, we can wash them next week if you think I'm starting!
But make sure, you know, you  well you take over the house, so we know what's in them in case they get thrown out with the bloody rubbish!
So we put them all into bin bags and we was trying to carry these bin bags  so the wind was taking them like balloons !
And you were hanging on  and trying to keep your feet on the floor!
God, I laughed!
And then er  they came.
I can't remember what time or anything about it.
I think they must have come to the flat.
They'd been for a meal and they came to the flat and they rung us to say they were there.
Something like that, I can't remember.
And then, the next day they came over.
I think they came that night.
The next day they came over.
And this gale was still blowing!
And it was blowing!
You just couldn't
Well I dare say they went back to the hospital!
No, they didn't!
No they didn't get, be there till eight!
Just  eight-ish something like that.
Cos they'd been for a meal on the way as well!
Cos I've said come over for supper.
No, they didn't want supper.
Cos they'd had this meal.
And erm  then the next day  they came over  and David was laughing, he said, do you, do you know the alley way down between  he said, well it blew it her up right against that bloody wall he said!
Well Aunty couldn't move he said!
He  I   and I said, and you laughed at her?
Course I did  he said !
And I said, did you help her?
No, I didn't.
Let her battle it out he said!
Well they came over here then and they'd been up  and they come back  with Gillian and all that and they stayed.
And they went from here about   nine-ish I suppose?
They'd had supper anyway.
Then they were going over and they were gonna go to bed.
They'd been to the hospital, and they'd been over the flat so I said to them  well pop the blankets on  and come over here then and have your supper  and go back.
And the beds will be nice and warm for you to get into.
But anyway, they left here about nine o'clock.
Well  she'd gone out through the door and the wind took her down the  bloody street!
I said to  though, he said she was going there another way!
And David was there  
 
was laughing !
And it was just   she was running with it!
There's just her battling against it !
They have mid-winter days just like our high summer!


It was lovely!
Oh and we laughed about it!
And I said, better go and  collect her!
But David said  look at  shifting !
Yeah  but er you see  on Christmas Day  children were going about in bikinis and  and shorts , or no socks or so 
Mm.
I couldn't, you know,i ,i , it's difficult to put it in your head, like when I was there!
Oh, it's Christmas Day you know?
Mm.
Christmas Day!
And I get us up in the morning now  and, she  said  she said the temperature rises to  sometimes a hundred and twenty in the summer!
And if it's a very hot day you try to stay in.
Yeah, but it isn't summer yet!
Mm?
It isn't summer yet!
No!
But if, if it'll do that at mid-summer i , it
It's about ninety there now!
Eighties.
Yes.
Eighty to ninety, sure to be!
And that's one of our terribly hot days!
Of course, everywhere i ,i , it's all air conditioned and  and it's, obviously.
Definitely mustn't open a window!
Then the, daren't open the window!
Cos the flies will come in.
Well she'll have bloody shock if she was here in the summer then!
Yes, I think.
Of course, I don't know, perhaps they 
Couldn't live in the winter!
Perhaps their flies are different to ours.
They are, they're the, the same.
Th They're mosquitoes.
Now then, she  mosquitoes so they, they bite .
Anyway you get a mosquito bite .
Yeah but, she said they don't da ,the they bite you and it's got poison if you're not careful!
I could never live with the window shut!
Of course, the room is air conditioned  all the time.
They have the batteries going and all.
Yeah cos they have it  keep pushing!
Same here!
One place to another!
Yeah, but it , it's circulating i , isn't it?
Yeah , but it's all the same.
not too nice.
 
It isn't fresh!
I was saying Danny the other day  do you remember the time he came and got out his in there?
I would get a piece of erm  well I got a piece in the greenhouse  it wouldn't worthy of it then, but it doesn't matter!
Piece of board  and fix in the doorway  and fix it open.
Put it high enough so that the cats wouldn't come, but leave it then.
It's just a big window open.
Cos then yo , once you have the doors closed as low as that  cos no air gets in!
No, actually cos it's not air 
We opened the 
conditioned here!
They are there!
You open the top  and then let the cats in at the bottom!
Yeah, that's it!
And, and circulate air, you see.
So I put a board across there.
They've got double windows.
Like, they got the window  and then they've got erm  a, a  sliding 
Sliding window inside.
Yeah.
Like a, a, a net  to keep the flies out.
You can open the outside window.
What do they call them?
Yeah.
Erm
Mosquito thing.
Well we used to have them in Middle House.
Erm, but ours was a piece of  frame work and a  grating on it, and you stuck that in the window, when you opened the window you push that in  so the air could come in and  mosquitoes couldn't.
You used to mo , mosquitoes dreadful at Middle House when the lake was there.
It's the damp  warm and damp.
No, the lake was mouldy you see!
Yeah, oh!
Stale, dirty water!
Was a breeding  place.
And we'd be out in the middle of that!

No.
Anyway  he says  it will be decided upon  cos  it's the  half an hour to go at it, you watch in the end  .
He said if there's one thing  I always carry quite close to my  heart  and if you'll just give me a minute I'll take  out.
And he read this    this P R  and he said  this is from a junior minister, Conservative  minister  in nineteen eighty four  wro wrote these words in a book  and he says  that up and coming  Conservative young minister  was none other than 
 
than Chris Patten.
And he was sat right next to him.
He didn't know anything about this   and he had to admit, he did say this!
This  .
But now, he says, it'll change his mind.
Mm  To change his mind.
You should of heard the people in the audience!
Well you can change your mind if you want to!
Yes but he wrote a book called this    because he thought that er    the conservatives were losing .
And they thought they were   .
Yeah.

Nineteen eighty three.
Well what's gonna come in to save them this time?
They're hoping  fall all back down again  that they're gonna fall back.
Fa 
You reckon?

And they think other people will change their minds.
To keep the same Prime Minister now.
You're wrong!
I like
