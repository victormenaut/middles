Why should it?
Well, I would think anything Swiss would be pretty staid.
Very proper.
I don't think so  anyway.
No lager louts.
I hope not  what's that?
I don't know, I imagine that it's something tha they're construct some work of art they

I know.
Nothing coloured see.
Yes.
Except just the colour is much better  alright what are you saying.
Now we could use plasterboard at a fraction of the price and put it up in the fraction of the time.
Only this lasts hundreds of years and the other 
Kathy I should hate to live in the house my grandfather lived in a hundred years ago!
No.
I probably I would probably wouldn't survive the winter.
Look come and see  it's how false it is nobody nobody would have all this white  you know, how stupid  it's really completely false, they would have colours an and not just white with beige.
I wouldn't survive the winter in that sort of house.
Well you would have to.
Well maybe if I was forced to.
I'm  I'm I'm really surprised how they could do it like that and these flowers would  honestly!
Everything is white.
Kathy you must go round the museum 
You would 
Are you going to the Tate on Wednesday?
No.
Why not?
You go there every Wednesday before long they'll ask you to run the library  elbow a few old ladies out of the way!
Ah look!
Did you know this ?
I think I may have it.
Did they send it?
I think so  but it's very out of date though.
What?
Well  it's not it's it look.
Well the paper must be out of date because I think I got that stamp months ago  in fact you bought it back from Switzerland.
How?
Mm.
I didn't bring you a stamp.
Yes you did.
Did I?
Must be mad!
This one?
Yes.
Oh  ah yes I bought it in   Did I bring you four?
Suppose so.
And what about these two, have you got these to two?
I think I have, yes  
You could also have this one as well, it's expensive actually.
I really must  take this over here again, you sit down there and 
Look, Patrick here, how well do you know Switzerland?
The nineteenth question is which celebrated Swiss clown and mime comes from  you know which don't you?
What?
Yes, Dimitri.
Yes.
Mm.
So he's a national asset isn't he did you know that.
Oh I should think he makes  money, yeah makes Switzerland known   Like Gabriella Sabatini is a tremendous asset to the Argentine
When did the
and Becker for Germany  and Gazza for England  Gazza Gasgcoine.
Doesn't sound an English name anyway.
No, they just called him Gazza, his name is Gasgcoine  nobody knows what his first name is.
No.
But Gazza goes well with Gasgcoine.
Ya.
Gasgcoine is rather a long word to say so I suppose the boys at school call him Gazza.
Ya, but wh where was that name, is it a French name?
I don't know  an invented name.
Gasgcoine 
It's been coined.
No, not Gasgcoine   French yes.
Or, Gasgcoine I don't know what it is probably of French origin, northern French.
Mm.
Gascony.
Mm  well.
Probably he was his ancestors were from Gascony and came over with William the Conqueror  like the name Norman  it's a widely known name in England.
Norman?
Ooh yes .
Mm.
His ancestors were probably Normans who came over .
they changed it into .
What?
I daresay their neighbours changed it to , like Gazza's neighbours have changed his name from Gasgcoine to Gazza  or the newspapers have done it.
Gosh!
I'm really stupid  you even have to name two big banks.
Well that shouldn't be difficult you see them on every street corner.
It depends where you are  a wait a minute  Well of course if you've some Chinese outfit look  I mean you would know all this wouldn't you?
I have to say so, yes I know a lot about it.
Well I suppose we are typical.
Well I wonder what Lord Hanson will pay me for my I C I shares  they're still writing.
No.
Oh yes  people are busy buying  hoping that Lord Hanson will pay them more  when they pay more.
You'll have to pay the bill won't you?
There's the man who owns Beaumont College now.
Show.
Chairman of I C L.
Saatchi Saatchi shows no signs of recovery.
Saatchi brothers salaries have been cut by a half  and they've appointed a new man.
They have?
Robert Louis Briggs to run the company.
Who is he?
French banker I think  Mr Arnold wanted to know why Maurice and Charles Saatchi were being paid such a ridiculously large salary when the state of the company was so absolutely dreadful.
So?
Mr Maurice Saatchi who now gets three hundred and ten thousand pounds a year compared with six hundred thousand pounds a year two years ago replied I'm quite satisfied  that involuntary taking a fifty per cent pay cut I have done the right thing.
Well.
Well they've lost their company  they've lost control of their company.
They founded it?
Oh yes and   and then it got too big for them  they are no longer able to control it  they're not big enough for a big power  two very big big brothers but they couldn't run a company the size they built it.
What are they,i erm  financiers or gr or or artists?
Oh they're advertising.
What, advertising?
One is a , one is an advertiser of embassy of the consulate, good combination.
Oh, Oh I see.
Like being important in   a gifted man reckons someone who knows how to handle the figures  no David isn't interested in figures  what  everyone knows that, he will tell you himself.
So.
He's got better things to do than play around with columns and figures  
Okay, Okay.
Wasting his time  like my spending my time on doors!
Okay.
Speak Hall ah what?
Speak Hall   
So it's  
one of the most beautiful houses in England.
Is it?
Oh yes.
And you've never been?
Ooh I was taken a long time ago.
Well I wasn't.
I think I liked it.
Is it furnished?
Why would I  liked it  how funny!
We wouldn't have got through the Mersey tunnel before there was aggravation.
Who lived here a merchant or somebody?
Probably, someone you would disapprove of  I didn't know whether remember  no probably not it goes back to the middle ages.
Well then he wouldn't be a merchant would he?
He could be but not the sort of merchant you're thinking of  there were lots of merchants in those days  those merchants who build up places like    they were Greek merchants, in fact they were called merchant venturers weren't they?
I don't know.
The great  cities were built by the merchant venturers.
I'll feed the birds and then you can see how they eat an and drink in the bath will you?
Well  I'd like to take the second one back, could you reach it in the car?
Beg pardon?
I'd like to take the second one back
and that's how and an my my back aches you know when 
Got any more black bags?
Yes, yes   flowers when they watered really  sometimes I I
all the others are dreadful.
Why?
Why should we not be nice?
Sorry?
They've lasted for nearly a fortnight.
A week  fortnight.
No, Isabelle wasn't here last weekend.
Ah, yes.
Is the recording still on?
I don't know, wait le let me see  yeah  these are nice these erm  erm
No those flowers have lasted fo for a fortnight.
That means the yellow ones for three weeks now, are finished now  every bud open every
She wouldn't he had some lovely irises but she wouldn't buy them cos she said they wouldn't last.
Yeah, well all  the shops are closed in it now  it's finished  put some chemical in in the water and makes them 
Well then obviously, they like it.
Will you do the lawn in front today?
Today or tomorrow  I really should put down some more fertilizer particularly on those brown patches  there are some brown strips in the front lawn.
Now look at that I want you to see them in the bath, they enjoy themselves like children.
Mm.
It's so funny  it's real entertainment  someone at the Tate said er, you know when I told them I bought the bird bath, they said you will have lots of pleasure with that  and I think I have.
Good.
Really  I'd like you to do the the lawn  just nice now otherwise in a week it's too long again ha?
Ooh I'm not sure with my blades up it'll have much effect  but we can try.
Yeah, it would look nice, like like that one.
But I don't think you'd see much difference.
Every weekend or two is a is it much eas easier if you have the blades, high up, ha, no?
Just a sec.
Say it.
The blade needs replacing at the moment it is snatching at the grass.
Well I I saw them in  Mill, but I didn't know which size, size you need  actually I saw some in  Mill.
Well are you sure they've got the right ones?
twenty-ninth of June   has never rained 
No, did you read the article in The Times about er 
About what?
watering gardens?
No, where is it?
Oh I think I've thrown it away.
Oh come on.
It was in yesterday's paper  it's already in the kitchen.
Can you tell me everything or or should I read it?
It just says don't water  if the plants look healthy don't water them, we overdo the watering and it their roots then start growing upwards towards the soil.
What, really?
Upwards towards the surface instead of down.
Why?
Overwatering  don't know Kathy I'm not a gardener!
Oh  overwatering what?
Overwatering is  is damaging to the plants.
Ah  then mine can't complain they usually have no water  no.
Only water if they look as though they need it.
Really?
Mm  and don't cut the grass too short.
And?
And that's what they say raise them.
I just think it's wrong because every day a tiny bit the ground loo looks much much better than if I don't give them for weeks an they do, well.
Oh if you don't think they look well then they obviously need it if they look better after they've been watered, that's what the paper says.
Well then they do need water.
That's the answer 
They  
if they look as though they need it they need it but if they don't look as though they need watering don't water them.
Well  look, look at the birds  I  aren't they sweet  all the same I shall buy a nesting box next er next year.
Mm.
I'd like to see the blue tits  come out  you know there was a programme on television and you saw inside a box  of a blue tit, a nesting box, right inside.
Ah, yes.
How could they do that?
How can they go so?
Obviously put in a little camera in the 
Inside in the box.
in the, or just in the 
In the corner.
in this little hole in the side of the box with a wide angle lens.
Oh, I see ah  I thought they had sort of you know like fairy tales, you can see  through the wall, that's what they do put a camera in in , anyway it was rather funny  and those birds come out and grow up  quite quite wonderful.
They can now put a television camera into your stomach.
Really?
And into your veins I think.
And in everybody's house  what?
Oh yes  and then ah here's a blue tit look  there you see, and then  where does it connect up, it doesn't happen.
I'm not sure perhaps it has a thin catheter or wire I don't know wire I'm not sure.
Just smells  I like wild birds because  that's the animal I like best because they are in the wild you don't have to cage them  but you have the pleasure of them being free, what?
Free isn't it?
You might get a bit of a mixture  a few other birds not always sparrows.
It's such an effort and yet I enjoy it so much.
But 
Well 
really  you know when you like it so much .
Oh yes, make some bread with the soup I've got to go out.
you know what they do if, if they have to go away.
They don't 
Really?
And  again.
What did you say?
They sometimes 
What?
 

Harrow or Ealing or somewhere like this.
Oh no

Three hours.
That's it.
From nine thirty until half past twelve.
The little  analysis and communication board.
Oh my grief.


How many , maybe that  simple, very simple  eh?


And what is it really?
What is meant by that?
It is, about comparing political, sociological, economic novels.
Well, what do you mean ?
Great communications, great .
How can you compare, how can you apply pluralism, imperialism.
Oh my god, can't you really find .
Which is?
.
or a corporate system, how can they apply to communications?
I still don't know any .
Okay, so,.
Give me an example.
Erm, alright.
For example, when you talk of, imperialism, when you look at, when we, we've study it from a , erm, quite a few, so it means that  that capitalism  supply
and, but the problem is, that, although it creates supply it laboured people who worked, yeah
Yeah.
cannot buy it because it's too expensive for them.
So capitalism has to export it over its boundary and that's one of the company, what you could call it period, for example, erm
I see.
Let's
Maybe become export, become  does it?
Alright, let's see the French , mm, mm, mm, yes.
Well .
So for example, I don't know, erm,, let's take an example,,, the French, erm multinational,tele telecommunications
Yeah.
National.
Do you know , you will find here, that they say .
Yeah, so you better  if you have .
I haven't .
You don't, okay.
Multinationals, they have erm,, doing much better abroad than it is doing in France.
Okay, well .
Because the French cannot always buy what  
Alright, alright.
so that's why it's only period.
Well you can call it export too, but export is .
That means imperialism means in a way they're the French market it's well known, and, makes itself sell at much a  than in its, in its own country, so you can say that for example Thompson has a monopoly tower, most European and  have a monopoly tower 
Yes.
in not only Holland but in Germany.
Yes, quite.
Belgium 
Yes, yes.
And so when you, so it means that the Dutch are leaders, so it's, it's kind of, that's how putting up the communications empire .
In Holland that the empire is broader than Belgium is.
Mm, mm.
Broader than all over Europe.
Mm.
That's why it's called imperialism.
Ah yes.
So it becomes in fact a telecommunication empire.
Yeah, it's really, it, it is the power not they're exporting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The power.
It's more than .
Yes.
Logical side of, of .
Yeah, yeah.
Now, alright, that's imperialism yes.
What, what's the other?
Eh, multinational.
They do a bit of imperialism.
, they are easy aren't they?
And then erm
Brussels.
I  my power at that, that place and nowhere else and nobody agreed and, well, they say we go somewhere else, and .
They're a big company in Brussels , and they got, they got their office where they like .
And now they're gone.
Aha.
Well you really .
But it's nice you know Brussels.
You know  
So what did you do yesterday?
Went there at what time?
Erm what did we do yes, well we went, I, I went to Isobel at what, I found her at three, we had .
  
We even gave her coconut to the dog which I  which was nice.
I see you.
No, no, yes my dog.
Aha, he, he, still thinks Isobel has the dog.
No I don't think so.
No.
No because it's another one, not the usual one.
I see.
So, then we went to .
Yeah.
I went home .
On Saturday afternoon we had tea at five with erm, Andre and .
Andre and .
Aha .
And they .
And they play well?
Yes.

He said,to myself, you know, just by myself,.
And so on.

My brother drove me.
Aha.
One week in .
No .
Yeah.
Yep, I hope it .
Youngest?
The youngest one.

Can't he work a bit in the day?
Is he fully occupied?
Yeah.

Aha, yes.
But he'll have to two more weeks then afterwards.

And a , Michelle.
Michelle is now in the , second  and then erm, he might go to Switzerland to study .
Ah yes, what is ?
The second year.
Yeah, yeah, what?
What?
In accountant.
Ah, has he .
I see, yes.
Are you still completely confident in, in finishing?
very quickly now.
Does it?
But erm
What about if you have to write it?
That's fine, well I have to, to make a, have to write a little letter and, and, that's .
And I wasn't sure of the work any more, but
Yes, you mix it up .
No, no.
Really, no.
No , it's quite a  apart.
Yeah.
It's much harder, I mean I simply , Swiss German, than Dutch
Yeah, really?
Aha.
cos I practice more it.
Yeah, yeah.
No, I, I really.
.
Talking yeah.
talking .
.
You know I still keep the Italian  you know , it's more  than French, at that time, and, well I worked in , I was, I was really quite good at it, but now, I just lost it.
First of all I never hear it any more on the continent I can't seem to hear the radio, you hear some, you know,put on the radio and you have a , Brussels already , he had nothing at all.
But don't you think that 
Oh no 
he would come back quick.
I don't know anybody, aperitif, and the and all that stuff, you know, the exception.
No,And I, I .
Aha, aha I told myself, I had to force myself not to.
I  at once, Stefan, there was an , I was  anything, just .
So a lawyer came, and of course I had my own office , confidential stuff, so he wanted to give it to me.
, and  in the machine or something, I had  you know, I never know, you have quite a few words which aren't any French or .
one language, one  and the others have two or two .
 
Or else, I .
Yeah.
And so I thought you .
You have .
Common .
Common?
Common.
No it's too .
As well.
Yes.
The French.
Yes.
I see, is it?
Yes,.
I know you're right, now it's imperative  with one  and it's with two .
Yes.
. That's what I mean.
poor chap, he's, he's getting furious and  and there are hundreds of .
Two S's you know and French you don't marks the difference, Italian you do say that you have double quotes,..


Writing I don't, I don't think she'd, she can write it there, I don't know.
Italian .
Yeah, and she ever uses it, why doesn't she forget it?
Well I think she uses it quite often, you know, I mean 
Where, where?
at the office, or the Italians come, she always uses it.
Well, when there are, I mean, I think, well I think it really con I mean, when I'm with the Dutch I really thought the other day I can  till David comes back again, quite quickly.
Well I hear you, but .
Mm.
I forget it, erm, where is it .
stop there for tonight, but I had  you know, I just spoke French.


I just didn't open my mouth, but I understood what they said and they didn't know .
You know, and so, so the second time, the second day I could say one or two words and the third a little bit more, but eh that's it.
Same when I'm, when I'm in Italy, I, I can't speak Italian very well, but when I'm there a week, I pick up words very quickly and although I know my grammar isn't perfect, I can form sentences in a way that people do understand me,.
Yes.
Yes.
I, that, for me the hardest thing to do is example is study Spanish.
Yeah.
Because as I heard my mother speak Italian all the time and my cousins, you really ca can in my, you know in your  
Yes.
Your sub conscience, yeah.
You'll pick it up.
Mm, mm.
And I really understand Italian quite well, and eh, when I had Spanish, I, I suppose .
You picked it up..
All the time I had, I had  Spanish.
Did you?
And when I had to speak, I spoke Italian.




Did you?
Well I didn't know Spanish, but I got by with the Italian, you know, I had, I had once,.
don't you?
Yeah, yeah.
And eh, Julia and  and eh Ruth and her husband , eh went to Madrid and I stayed with Isobel.
Mm, mm.
, and we went to the beach and I came back and  , leap of the whole er, side of the car.
You can imagine so, I , it's awful.
So
Yeah.
I , want other people's cars in .
That's very funny, for example, I went Dutch because when we were small my brother run away.
Yeah.
He always, well we not always  often, very often, spoke Dutch with each other.
Did you?
Yes, because of, we were in school together in Dutch and on the way home we were with Dutch friends, so we  then, and we mostly spoke Dutch and now, since I, so it's nearly, since now seven years have been, since I have gone to States, first year in eighty three, came back in eighty four, and since then we've never, ever spoke Dutch.
Erm, yes, yeah yes.
Yes I see now, ah, yeah .
We always speak French to each other.
Yeah,.
That a make .
if you spoke Dutch all the time.
Oh.
So
Yes, with my mother and my father .
All French,, yeah.
when we couldn't, when, when we were not allowed to in the States.
Really, I think it 
But now it
 
 
I remember a  on the telephone, you know, I used to speak and talk and talk, apparently she would switch to German, so that means that I can't  someone  
 
Shouldn't allow it, I, I always knew what it meant .
And, that, you make me think of it, suddenly she'd switched.


For what happened she can do it because, so okay, let's hope it's going to be nice.
I really pleased with, with that .
Really, I really like it.
Sweet, isn't it?
It's very nice with the plants on.
Yes, yes.
Very, very nice.
Now I'm, I'm really thinking all the time , something in the back thing 
The grass, the garden  .
Looks nice, and erm, how do you call these erm, ah
.
Looks nice.
Yes.
It's, it's already once cove covered the whole wall, but when we took the other fence down, the high fence eh, you know, they damaged everything.
Erm, I'm going to lose , digging so much, it's terrible.
It looks nice .
Right.
Come a  no you've seen that,.
Yes.
You know you can, you can take few of these chairs, and, these chairs and tables here,in the evening, whenever you want to read there, you can do that.
Okay right, right.
I've already asked.
Where the keys?
There we are.


I'm not going to throw that away until .
Put away my things.
Yes.
Cos he was a man.
No.
Oh you have to, oh you can't leave him alone one second .
But he still has his hat on.
Oh yeah, at night, anyway because at night he's alone and he's  from it and during the day, I know, I know my brother as I can't rely on the, and, and, you know, and look at, Michelle would look at, at him all the time, but , put, put the thing on you know.
Yeah.
And so erm 
So  


I tell you I take  off when I go out now, because, everyone looks at you.
Laugh, oh they laugh, oh they are funny, they even  they have to explain it and we didn't .
And it's quite dangerous, because it doesn't hear very well, that , when you're behind him .
Where are you?
And eh
You know,.
You take it off the .
Doors we can have them painted,.
He comes into the door, he comes into the door and it's like  
Guess that, that would happen.
I went and  all the way 
Except for the hotel which is the most wonderful walk hotel 
yeah 
Beautiful garden,, my mother and I said very well you, we will come for week here but we won't go out of this .
Aha.
Not one .


It's raining  
Why on earth did he want to go there?
Because he had  
I don't know, there's this house, what's falling apart like, and it, it was small, it was like, I think it was wide at the .


Right, so it was wet, very tiny 
Aha.
Aha .
and erm, and so, you know we didn't say anything  erm, cos he wanted us to buy, so Michelle and I went and my mother.
We only went for two days.
Yes.
And so, but the surroundings on .
Beautiful, yes, yes.

No, no.
They have kind of you know, in the back, in that little house,, I mean if you buying you know, it's like , I mean, if I had  to go there two weeks in the year, you know what I mean.
Oh yes, yes .
Yes.
So I would like to go there, I would never ever spend more than two days there, in the winter, and if I, except  staying at this wonderful hotel.
Yes.
It's where we had the most wonderful room, in the, in the, my brother Michelle and I we said, you know, we arrived there with my brother had, my father had an appointment with, with the architect at three o'clock in the afternoon so we went too , before
Yes.

You know yeah, yeah, I don't know where it comes from .
So she went with the architect and he was wanting to show us this kind of   and we were like, were cold and were back to the hotel, we didn't even go into the house.
No.
And, and, it's was so bad, oh it was terrible.
I mean the house in itself, no, I mean
Aha, that lady you could see  have responsibilities, no?
Responsibilities, I mean, it would have to be torn down and build up again it was in such a bad shape, it was really,I mean, terrible, it must of been, it was, it was man who lived in since the second world war, alright, so you get .
The, the, there was a very old car,, one , in a beautiful car but there was nothing left of the car, you couldn't even

That's right,, it's a, it's a, so my mother and I said we're going back to that hotel, you know, were very, very kind of luxury type, so we went back to the hotel and my brother and I went into the room where we had a television view on the sea, very beautiful.

Which are classically beautiful and, what's that  Ah there's another one isn't it?
Ya he's a sort of a friendly painter?
Hm hm
What?
Yes.
He was born in  was he?
Hmm
Fifty thousand.
Ah I wish I had that money.
I would like to have it 
I want a 
Do you?
Yeah I like him too .
He has much stronger colours.
Huge things and beautiful things 
Stronger colours and all that isn't it?
Ya.
The problem with that painting is that I didn't know if it was a real 
 
because there was nothing no signature whatsoever.
No?
Nothing.
No no even 
Did that happen 
on the back
Did that happen
Not even on the back 
Does he sometimes not do.
Many do.
Many do.
Ya.
This fellow doesn't
He signs, he doesn't no
No no
And not on the back
No
But you have a certificate.
Yes
Then it's fine
By seeing in the catalogue and er
Uh huh.
So that's no problem is it?
No
There is some 
I ask him why he did it he said oh well he has such a long name  such a very long name spoils the picture
But he can put it he can put it on the back
Yeah alright I just I don't know why he doesn't.
He didn't give me satisfactory answer he said oh I'll think of it
Artists never give satisfaction
Why?
Because they're artists
Really?
They very sore people, and they're very stubborn most of them so whence they have an idea and can't get them away from it very very easily
Uh huh
it's very hard
Is it?
And they change their minds and things,
Hmm hmm
Do they?
Oh yes you know sometimes an artist says the picture is his and two years later he denies and says it's a false one
Hmm
Hmm.
Yeah
Why would he do that?
Because he doesn't like it anymore?
Or yes that's one thing because he doesn't like it anymore or he might have had a a problem with selling it to someone or something and just to take revenge or something he says
Yes
It's never been mine .
You wouldn't be  would you?
No
You've never seen another one like that, no
Yes
Ya.
Ya he's a bit mystical isn't he?
Mmm.
Nice 
Huh huh.
I think he's probably the most  would you not say so?
Yes indeed.
I think he is.
Is he always 
Quite some yes 
Yes 
We don't have anything from .
That's a very beautiful .
Very very.
That's him.
Yeah.
Another sales  another let's see what he says.
This old man made now that woman ring.
Er Supervisor and so on.

She's  All right we'll come it's Thursday and then we will show you in you and your husband and I said no not my husband you better leave it you know.
That's right 
She said no it's how you wish.
I said no 


You know I am alone.
Just incredible.
It's incredible.
Gosh!
Interesting.
You're not allowed to make your own decisions.
No well you see they just don't think that somebody can decide and who will who's the owner of the house and things like that?
You know.
Probably they think I am a chamber maid here.


It's it's rather pathetic.


Why  
or the mistress who buys the  
I really don't fall.


Have you seen?
 
Why do they bother?


Usually they do try to tell they want usually most people are there
But how do they
They never
together?
You know on a Thursday?
They will know.
They meet you.
They come and 
Oh
Sit and come at midnight


As long as there are two.
Nobody's been so insistent yet you know.
They all try to get you both but er I have decided the other things I mean I tell Patrick and
I know

I shan't have wanting their quote anyway and then I decide.
We decide together.

About three or four big bigger high street shops you know like Alders and what is the next?
Army and Navy.

No
You know they all have the same thing.
So  exactly the same brands same things.
If you can't find it in one you find it in another but it is all the same thing.
It's all 
You know another thing I can really ask technical questions.
A man wouldn't dare because he doesn't want to show how ignorant he is.
I can ask them a stupid questions.
I get everything answered and so and so and you learn quite a lot and I just ask.
You know I don't care whether they think I'm stupid or so you see.
A man would not do it I have noticed.
Hmm?

In a certain way
And he decides
But I have no I don't know who did decide sure you know print .

Except for the biggest pieces
Yeah
Gosh!
It's all ready
Yes getting very
Would you love to have it?
Classic.
Why are they so expensive?
Because they're very rare
Why?
Are they rare?
There are only about a hundred made
Yes?
Yes.
Special collections 
Who makes them
They were made for special occasions
Were they?
For instance?
They're nice aren't they?
we
Just for ?
Yes I suppose so.
unclear Yes?
Not always.
Sometimes they were sold in shops as a special limimited edition.
Just as a  Swatch Collector's .
Yes really.
I mean now exactly we send out about dunno how many letters to ask if they have anything to sell.
So we the whole collection since eighty three.
When did it start eighty three 
Eighty three Sure?
Yeah.
Yeah you have any   they have the whole  thousands?
No not thousands but 
Yeah hundreds?
Yes hundreds
Because the books come out then to be edited
Yeah
Really?
That quick?
Yeah
Is that because they are too expensive?
No
How much are these?
Oh!
They can go very high now.
About ten thou I dunno.
The middle one is the is the most expensive
No?
That tell me low ah the no one is twenty five one is thirty seven and and hundred and seventy eight that means he threw three together.
Come and see can't be forty forty five.
Look.
Which one is this?
Twenty five and thirty seven
No I no this one is the most expensive one
How do you know?
But how do you know?
This is that one is seventy eight.
Is not what 
Ah hah I see.
Yes this is twenty five
Yes.
See 
and this is thirty seven.
But why  
they'll they'll be too late
Ah it is written here.
I'm sorry yes
It's one thousand francs to two thousands 
But it's not possible.
Forty thousand and you paid
I even wanted to buy that one and this one too.
When when I when they were out
I didn't even see it
Yes I've seen it
Have you seen it?
Yes and I know I have one which is totally black with here the caldon
Needle yes
You know and supposedly it should be worth a lot.
I dun't know
They don't make it anymore?
No
I almost thought that too.
And then I have the jelly fish which is the totally transparent one
Mmm mm
The problem it's very expensive when it doesn't say Swatch and it's all white nothing so it's just  a Swatch and so on it's probably not as much
Have you seen it?
Yeah
I haven't seen any of them
I have seen those two.
This one I have never seen before.
Can you imagine?
Can you?
In how many years?
Eighty three and eighty nine
Eighty nine
No!
No no not
Three years yes 
eighty nine 
Yes eighty nine
Hah!
Two years
Hah!
It must have cost a lot at the start but they 
But they are all the same huh?
No but those  you couldn't buy like that.
This was a  is an artist who made a special limited edition of them
Yeah and where do you buy them?
I don't know.
Probably you could buy them some stores have them for maybe a week or so.
They were all sold I dunno.
No?
There's  in Switzerland and
I see
But they must have cost a lot
Yes?
I think so
As what?
Well
They are exactly the same size as the others
I know but you know we have a serie limit edition is full up.
During  Swatch watches
Did he?
Yes
No I didn't know.
Hmm hmm in Belgium they were
What did they look like?
They were all kind of silk covers with the  painting in the middle
Huh huh
and the they cost at that time the Swatch costed about one thousand three hundred thousand francs and they costed about two thousand eight hundred I think
Ah huh did they?
Must be they were all the same 
No
I have seen just bigger ones black but very 
Yes those are called
Which are very expensive but not forty one
No
And they have been very much but I though that Swatch cost that much no there are 
But some types before in the beginning all Swatches were the same price 
Ah huh .
It's that one which just with the tiger in gold no more?
No
And I saw it and I thought ah I saw it in Zurich.
I'll get that I like it  so it's er I didn't 
That I know how but I bought it
You got?
At Easter time yes I bought it at Easter time
Ah you've got it?
And then I amd they said I think that one is worth something
And you have the men?
Hmm hmm
And the men  the woman as 
Mm mm yes
Have you seen  yeah?
Yes
Yes?
Rather nice?
Yeah
But
and the one's  too late I like that one too and I wanted to buy it as 
I've never seen do you think every country gets different ones?
Yes no well some countries don't get
all 
all 
Mm
Yeah.
For example well I don' know which Swatch really but on Omega up for example there are Omega watches in Belgium which you can't buy in Switzerland
Can't they?
which are only made for export.
For example my dad's brother Omega which you couldn't find in Switzerland
No?
Which was only made for export.
Do you think a lot of people buy watches?
Yes
Yes  a lot of makes then there can't be very much left.
Well the market is quite large
Do you think?
Well I managed a collect a small  very decorative.
I see forty thousand  in how many years?
Two years.
Two years!?
Yes
I cannot cost forty thousand
I mean the one who bought that you know 
He must laugh now.
Why should we  
And I would be very happy you know
and things like that
Do you really think it's that much money
No.
You would get it?
I would never give that.
But do you think someone will pay that?
I don't I don't know.
I have no idea.
'TIS nice
'tis maybe over estimated too
I see yeah
Ya so that if the  goes up to thirty thousand the reserve might be large enough to give it to sell it for that price.
For example sometimes they overestimate certain works of art and you wonder you know during the sale you see it's estimated forty to fifty thousand so you think they'll never give it to you for less.
Sometimes a  gets up to thirty and then they give it to the person
Yeah it depends 
Then one wonders why.
It's just because or they over estimated it or it's the price you know
They wanted to get 
They wanted to get
Yeah yeah
It's 
Yes well my dear look next time I have all again
 

next time round.

They do something they manage  with such
One night one even

Really?
Until someone drops dead?
Yes
It will be a long way to wait to have your place.
 

So, do you is it fun?
It's fun yes
Is it?
It's quite well it's fun because I you know the people and you see them once or twice a year and it's it's nice to see them back and talk
Yes
but the procession for us is like the most boring thing because we we just walk on the Grand Place for about five minutes
You don't go round  
and then we sit 
Hmm hmm
No
No?
No we only start from the Grand Place and then we sit on the  there's a big escarpment on the  and then we sit there
Hmm hmm
So  and it's  and most every every single year there's something different but very little.
I see.
And so 
Ah huh
We know
Colour goes out of your wig or something?
Something like that or one  they put in that wasn't there or some 
Uh huh .
I've never seen it.

Yeah
Oop!
It's a nicer in here than the hall it is very warm
You know this is very much against this is something typical of the seventies this kind of thing
Seventies?
Hmm hmm like
No it's not seventies stuff you know that is made now 
Hmm hmm I know because it's back in fashion but this was built initially this was something that you could find very much in thirties
Right.
It was fashion you and you would have bracelets with them you'd never seen and big rings like planets.
This is this plastic or is this or is it perhaps you know resin?
I think it's plastic.
You think it's plastic?
Yes I think it is.
Yes.
Yeah you know you know they feel different you know.

This is 
This is yes
I sometimes  one may be I'm completely wrong
I never thought of it was plastic
Yeah 
There might be some very you know  I don't know
I don't know but then frankly thinking but then I got them in the end you know I just didn't sell them because nobody paid that much and then ah in the outset and I paid quite a big price for for two for Patrick and me and then when they were they they dropped the price and then I got some more.
Ah huh
You know what I mean?
Hmm hmm
When they were very expensive I just bought two for us to change a bit and then I thought right now they dropped half and then I bought some more
Hmm Hmm
But er not before.
Funny thing!
When I had them first I thought I'm never going to use them you know they're so clumsy and they're so big and now I rather enjoy them.
They grow on you they grow on you.
Funny!
Well anyway with me
They're nice.
They're very nice
You don't have to be polite.
No I really like them.
I'd look round the kitchen

Oh well yeah tired, I shall sleep
I think that better go in the kitchen
Do you want me to help you.
No.
That's 
Were you in time?
Yes
Hmm?
Yes?
Yes I was very .
I was there about five after nine.
You still looked nine thirty and then could you make even or did you have to wait around?
I had to wait for about ten minutes.
Did you?
Socks
You are tired.
Why don't you lie down a bit?
Well I'm doing much better now.
Are you?
Yeah but just soft strokes.
Did you did you sleep well?
Yup.
You did?
Hmm hmm.
Yeah.
with you round.
You know he did
You know what really put everything in the jacket.
Nearly put so I wasn't nervous.
Did he come at once?
No.
You know sometimes
Yeah but I you know no 
 
It comes it comes by bits and bits with me.
Yeah 
All the time it's always like that and I hate that because I'm that's why I'm so slow too.
You know you have people who write it once you know once through.
I can't do that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Impossible.
I've never been able to do that.
Yeah.
So I write like ten lines or something
yeah
Then poof.
I have to wait and see how I'm going to to do further.
What you know.
Yeah.
Because I have to structure while I'm writing I you know so I'm structuring while and I can't write  as well.
You only structure?
I think that's a good idea er to structure before you plan make a plan before you start.
Yeah
But I somehow I don't do it and I know I'm sure it is
Yeah
It is better.
No I
Well I planned a little bit but even if I plan I still can't write it.
Yeah yeah yeah and you know what until I get started takes long for me and then I usually can get going you know but until I keep going or sometimes somebody  and I say that's it!
And then after one page or half.
My God!
I don't know anything anymore
Yes that's it
you know what I mean?
That's it.
And then  I have to start something else.
Yeah
Does that happen to you?
Yeah.
My third question today
yes?
I was I didn't know which question to take
Yes that's it yes
One or the other,
Hmm hmm
which one should I take?
So I decided at least I stood there for ten minutes which one should I take?
Wondering which 
You know?
Which is the most stupid thing.
Well no.
It's just
And then I started one  and I said no no no I won't be able to do this.
And I started another one and I said no I won't be able to this and got back to the other one and did the other one..
And I remember once we had that was we had accountancy  and we have a year to pick that one.
We had to have solved so much problems and I just this way and I just wouldn't have it you know it's just impossible it's impossible and I hummed and hawed which way and hummed and hawed which way.
In the end it must have been the right one because I was the best of all and I you know until five minutes before everything finished I just couldn't make up my mind
Hmm hmm
So er I was just lucky
yeah
To to have taken the right decision for once.
Uh huh
But as it is as you say you know it took five minutes before it all happened in  I find this very  don't you?
Or you know you know how to continue?
. Tomorrow it's easier isn't it?
Didn't you say so?
Yes
Much?
Hmm.

Just two next week.
Also I've asked you I'm sure many times but
Also the one next
Also Wednesday and Thursday?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's that will come easier to you really?
Yeah.
This one was hard because this one to me I think was the hardest because it was was theoretical
Yeah yeah
and we had to have theory that much you know 
Yes yes 
And tomorrow it's hard because it's an economics one and I have never had economics before so but it's the second part in Zurich because it's flying economics  telecommunications and political television

Sorry?
In broad lines.
Yes in broad lines.
Somehow I sort of mentioned  do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
nothing to do with intentions has more to do with sort of  intuition.
Yeah.
I can, and I can feel immediately if it will click with someone or not, you know if, if I'd like someone or not.
But it clicks with you?
Yes.
Or, when the, no, when I see, I meet someone for the first time.
other people click?
First time 
I can 
sort of guess 
I classify meeting people.
Yeah
It's a bad thing to do.
Why?
Because you don't, sometimes you can have a very wrong opinion of someone.
Have you had wrong opinions?
Yes I think, well mm 
you see, you just think it's  or have you  experienced that you were, first you had a bad or a good  impression and then you had to change which I used to do very often.
I  I had always too good an impression of everybody.
And then I had to come back.
In  you know?
No, not  
You give everybody a chance.
No, I sometimes even now I classify people at first and sometimes come back to my decision yes I do.

Then you  and you're expelled.
Naughty girl, always makes fun  she was absolutely a very intelligent woman but she spoke soft and slowly so everybody just sort of, who knew her superficially, she was not a very intelligent woman, she really was I can assure you.
She's all black now  all along, so 
 
she  can be awful really sarcastic she would she would she would mimic her ah so.
That was very naughty.
Anyway I made completely the wrong decision with her with her the first time.
Yeah.
It was because she spoke so slowly afterwards I didn't even realize it.
She writed me.
Erm she was in India and I wanted to go and she said  a Hindi course at A T R in Zurich.
Aha.
And she says come on, my, you girl I tell you this and that.
Let's meet and er  I'll give you  hints for .
And I thought, oh not her, you know, she won't, what she tells me won't be interesting.
I know.
And yet, it just clicked after a while that she is, yes I don't know, we became  the best of friends.
And I went to that meeting thinking
I know
it will just be .
That happened to you?
Yeah.
We could .
She's no right to tell you about things  it just was that.
afterwards,you know the  you go up, you have
Yeah.
A T E, A T R at the university and just, the block, the side of the university, she had her apartment for a little time.
And  every Saturday for a whole year she run a Japanese consulate.
Mhm.
And, every Saturday she would cook for me, usually curry, something and a good bottle of wine.
And Sunday she would come to me and I'd cook for her.
Fine.
Right.
When I used to turn down the corner of the  strasse I heard her music.
She used to  right up and,I can remember the sort of hot days, you know
Yeah.
and the water music which she had about  you know for months and months she would have the water music on and you used to hear it in the .
So 
Funny .

Just the side street.
Yes.
But just, almost, you know, near the  strasse and , I can't remember the name.

Ah yes.
By the, by the , up there?
Yes.
That's 
With the  at the corner.

And then, er, I think, er, a beautiful conception they just finish this, they made a new train station, did you know the ?
Ah the  yes.
Isn't it wonderful?
Yes.
And also, one thing you have to see, come on, I'll show that next.
It is the most incredible

I absolutely love it.
Incredible.
Yes it is.
I mean he kept, I mean he didn't do anything to the city you can't even see it from  the old one's still standing and it's in the wrong  it's so nice.
the other one is  mmm  and also the shops  
I mean when you compare it to the new one in the  which is awful.
Ah.
Is it?
So  how can they do, and it took about ten years to build this  
ten, yes?
they, they, they tore it all down which was the most wonderful thing.
to pieces.
Aha.
And they put the most ugly thing.
Ugh 
Yes.
is really  
terrible 
even the shops 
I know.
You know they are not pleasant to shop in are they?
No.
You rush out usually
Yes.
and you know  because it is a huge thing isn't it?
All outside, gutted inside and already the, the shops and the restaurants outside are .
Yeah.
Right.
.
And you know what?
I used to see the the  before it was sort of dirty and you just wouldn't go would you?
And you wouldn't see it, it was hidden or something  that side of the station, you just wouldn't go.
I know.
And now it's all opened up.
Yeah.
It's quite nice.
It will be lovely.
It's not finished yet is it?
No it isn't.
Well it's, it's
when will it
I don't know how long it will take
Not, not, the er, er, the next  already 
There is one restaurant already opened which is quite nice.
There are, yes,
Yes.
several even.
And  has, I almost, I came out of the station from  from  I almost spent all my money in my handbag in that place, already, you know?
I just couldn't resist
Oh there is some very nice stores.
Yes.
And I even, you know, got stopped in the station  itself before I started.
Ah
I enjoy music.
If it's nicely done then I, I think it's going to be well done.
But why is  so badly done?
Er, I don't know what that is, it's 
Wasn't he up for, mm, mm, you know, for competition?
Was he just a local figure or, or local architect, or  mm?
I don't know mm I don't know.
It's quite , quite  
He had  it was an American who won the competition
Erm
and really everybody is thrilled with it.
Wonderful.
Incredible.
Yes.
You use it sometimes?
Or you don't?
I just went to see it
No, no never.
Oh yes, yes
.
She could go on to the other station but she says I enjoy being in  so much  I use it.
That's my first  station I came to Zurich.
St  
St  aha, yeah.
And, er,that was the first station, I came alone.
And it was late.
It was lovely.
And  is also nice, it's an old one.
Ya, well, mm, it's not too bad.
It's nothing extraordinary, but, er, it's alright.
No, it's alright.
But  strasse I find is warmer, erm, well I suppose it has  
Oh yeah,yeah, yeah 
Have you been in the  restaurant?
No.
No?
No.
I don't know what it's about.
Could it be for you?
Could it be?
I don't think so.
No.
yeah, yeah, I'm awfully sorry .
So at least they let me know which is fair enough, ha?
All the others  I mean, all try but then this is alright.
None 
So,
the vice president or someone, so in other words  says, I'm, I'm sorry we can't, it would, would have been tomorrow morning.
Sorry I can only be done , I said, mm, would I understand, and I said yes.
Well  that's er  They should be sorry because, you know, I could just as well 
yeah
strange.
Let me see   I can't read it.
It says   
You know where that comes from?
 

You know where it comes from?on the way back, we, we stopped somewhere   in, in a sort of a farm or something
Aha.

And it was  it must be that.
So it's a year old, no more than a year old.
