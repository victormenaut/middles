Are we going to decorate the kitchen today?
Oh yes, that was what  oh, but wi with the weather being nice we ought to be out.
It was a question of, if it wasn't very nice we would finish
Ah.
I haven't really  to get down it was just I, I took  .
Mm.
Oh!
And the contents of that board of course.
I don't want young  messing up.
Well I'd better check what we have to do it with.
Mine is like that  
But do

Well no, I meant your, the one you made.
I think I've got all the paint but erm
Oh I thought you knew whether you'd got it.
Mm.
But if, if it's a nice 
That looks nice.
day I think we ought to be out in the garden.
And we'll save the decorating for when it's raining again.
Cos it's not as if we have to keep it for the weekend, I can do it during the week.
No that's better.
Is that how you like your toast?
Yes thanks.
underdone.
Mm.
But hot?
The two boys are up the dentist on Thursday.
Oh no!
Heaven help the dentist!
See Alison.
Who's see Alison?
No, we're going to see Alison.
That's the dentist.
Ha?
When I went in there the other week, you walk in and think  isn't she nice.
Then she starts messing around with your mouth.
And then, then she
yeah,she  you and she said, oh, you alright?
And you think oh she's marvellous!
Then she says, I'll just clean this bit of tartar off.
After that you think, you    right.
I think that's worse than having a filling.
But dad
What?
it's called decay.
No,
No, love, no it's not.
They get this drill do they?
They put them
No she, it's 
She has a scraper with a pointed er 
Scraper on the back of your teeth.
Does it hurt?
It doesn't hurt, it's uncomfortable.
I've got very sensitive gums  cos I've  brushed them badly 
I 
for years.
I don't think we have to discuss that while we're eating.
All too prone to neglect  so that's why we take good care of your teeth.
Pardon?
No it's not, I didn't put it back.
Oh.
Do you really want to carry on using that mug?
Can't you start on something else?
I like it.
You like it.
And my crocodile mug  as well.
Yes.
Do you want to start using that?
And put your turkey mug away for a while.
Yes.
Good.
Well David's mug is positively quiet compared to yo 
I'll finish this drink first though.
Well yes .
I think we might even wash it before it goes in the  David's mug is quiet compared to  Oh have you bitten your mouth again?
I think it's because you try to eat too much at one go.
Well there's this first.
If you want to wear your jeans Chrissy, they're in the drawer.
I just got the wrong pair out.
Oh.
I'd forgotten there was a new pair in the wardrobe with, still with the labels on I hadn't taken off.
Mm.
As long as you don't put a belt on they're still long enough.
Are they?
Can I wear my track suit?
.
Yes, that's alright.
I'd like to put two .
Okay.
Gosh!
What's your plan on the violin front today Chris?
Yes.
We didn't do a particularly good practice on Thursday.
Friday night you got let off.
So  there's two good ones to do.
We've got to go through one of the exam pieces.
She wants to run through them all and then you've got to fill in a piece of paper on which three pieces you'd like to do, and al you know, she wants the cheque and  full details of what name to go on the certificate and that sort of thing.
I read it through as four pounds, and Brenda next to me is saying, fourteen and I had to re-read it, it, course it's fourteen.
I thought that was rather a lot.
Not really.
Mm.
I don't remember it being that much last year, but she's using a different board this year so maybe that's something to do with it.
David, another piece of this.
I think he's had enough.
Right.
No, not, not , Vitalite please.
Oh.
I know.
I know, I've got it all worked out.
I'll have the crusts.
No, but there isn't a crust.
Oh oh!
Well if you, he's developed a taste for crusts.
Oh!
Aha, use th bag we might need to put that behind it if you wouldn't mind please.
Anybody got any preferences for dinner tonight?
I can see a 
No  
Dad, I can see a crust in that Vitalite.
Ah but in
That's the next one.
that's, that's a new one but we're just using the old one 
But there's one last in, in this one cos you've had the crust already.
Ra 
I know it must be you because it wasn't me.
Did you like that granary bread?
Ooh yes!
Daddy's cut you a nice thick slice.
Yes.
Mm mm.
Er
Oh!
I can't eat it plain.
I'm not, I'm not asking you to eat it Dave, I just wish you didn't pass it across to me like that.
Oh!
Sorry!
We do 
Do you want a bit more?
Yes please daddy.
This finished?
I'm sorry.
Dad 
Oh you put that there.
Mm.
Yes?
The only thing wrong with that granary bread  is that every time you cut it it wriggles, wriggles.
It wriggles.
Well it's alive.
It goes like, woo ooh!
Mum will do that for you.
That's the knives int it?
That's better.
This.
Marmite again then?
Yes mum.
Breakfast is nothing like reading a comic.
We never said it was.
Well, I don't see the connection.
Oh oh oh!
You know, you read your comic at breakfast.
Well, you might.
Well dad doesn't read his newspaper at breakfast.
What newspaper?
We only have a newspaper once a week.
There you go.
Thank you very much.
Dave!
Chomping away.
Do you want spaghetti tonight?
Suits me.
Spaghetti David?
Got some of that lovely oatmeal bread?
I didn't know you were talking about bread.
Nice big oatmeal buns.
I think, I think on the grounds that erm  what we've been, I'm gonna have chicken on Sunday.
Well
Is that alright?
Yep.
Fine.
After two dinners now I've had enough.
Well that's what I thought.
I was going to do beef but I think er  I think we'll go back to chicken.
Mhm.
I'm not interested.
I had that Thursday night.
The beef, yes, that's, I thought you did.
Erm, we need some more milk.
I was just  a bit too short of time on, on  Friday to  That's about all I need.
And, some vegetables.
Yeah.
But we can pick that up any time today can't we?
Mm.
Or Sunday.
Certainly get looks like it  the sun's going in.
Mm mm.
Yeah, probably if you want me to get that old mower going I ought to go up to Woods and  see if I can get a new drive belt.
Well it would be nice if I could use it.
Mm mm.
But why don't you use the other one?
And when, when the weather is nice 
Mm?
I said I would be very happy to be out there.
We've got two mowers.
The red one and a green one.
Why don't you use the green one?
Well I like the ride on one because it's easier.
The, the  green one it takes hours to cut  used to take about three hours for me to cut all the grass with that one.
But first, but when we first came here I spent three hours on a Sunday morning, and I only did that area where you play football.
Ah!
Mind you, I was just slow.
Mm.
Erm 
If you'd started the motor and used it it would have helped.
What about, are we going to put that one in the sale this year, the one that's out in the shed?
Yes I would think so.
Yes it would be nice if we were, we got rid of that.
Put it in the 
Then I can 
traction engine rally auction.
That's what, yes I think it was .
But it's the  it's the transporting of it.
I have no trailer.
You see if we can get away on holiday earlier this year because the violin exam's in June or in July we'll be back.
Cos you remember we came round, we came back the night before the traction engine rally cos I didn't have time to get organized.
What about, you could hire a trailer.
Not with your mouth full!
I'm sure we could  work out something.
I'll have to check I've got all the engine bits, whether I left any at dad's so I can at least stick, bolt 
Mm.
the engine back together.
You do agree though we should get rid of it?
Yeah.
I'm never going to do that one.
There's your tractor to do, there's my motorbike to do, and so many other 
I know but that 
things that mower's a 
I don't like 
goner.
that out there it is because at the back of my shed, I want to do some  I want to tidy that area up.
Mm.
Repot some plants.
Dad.
Yes love.
You've never taken us on a ride on your motorbike this year.
Well I haven't, haven't had it out this year.
I'm not going to
D'ya know I think, I think, I think it has been out this year.
Yes I, actually I think it
It has.
I think we have run it once this year.
But er, there's two things Dave.
Yes.
Number one is, I don't like using it on wet grass.
The other one, is you and Chrissy  getting too big to take you both on it now.
Have to be one at a time now.
And you'll have to ride on the back, you can't ride on the tank any more.
Why?
You're too big.
You're too big now.
You're six now.
I remember when I used to ride on the tank.
You were only a baby, I used to be very frightened.
You had nothing to hold on to, you were just squeezed in between daddy's legs.
But when I  was a bit older
Mm.
and I was still riding on the tank
Yes but
I gripped a erm  I gripped it.
Yes.
Yes yo well your hands were a bit bigger and you knew where to hold on.
More?
Yes please.
Thank you.
Dad.
Mhm?
We can get the motorbike out in the summer.
Mm.
I wasn't meaning that motorbike in any case.
That one goes.
There's another one in there that doesn't.
Ah.
Oh don't tell me .
Which reminds me, when are we going to get rid of all those other car bits in there?
Oh yes!
I know, there's a windscreen up er, on the ceiling
Mm.
we which came from the car you, you two got married in.
And you've still got that  paste on it.
I was under the impression we got married in the church .
No you got it wrong Dave.
Well you nicked it off someone's car though.
I dismantled  that car.
It was one  your uncle David  brought up for me so that I could get  take it to pieces to make the car we'd got  better.
Ah!
Took the engine out, the gearbox out.
You do realize it's nine years later and we've still got the bits, got all the bits in the garage?
Mm mm.
Be collector's pieces.
Can we get rid of them?
No I'm, I'm 
D'ya want any more?
I'm having another piece of toast in a moment.
But there's no rush though.
I'm tired this morning, but not as tired as I thought I would be considering two nights out.
At least you've had one of them in your own bed.
Mm.
And the smoke  the smoke on Thursday was awful!
You'd think the Roadrunners friends wouldn't smoke as much as they did.
But then you see Wen Wendy brings all the friends from Leckernby Installations, of course, they all smoke.
They got crowds of them from there.
Mhm.
Actually I was thinking  it would be nice erm  I have to make a team up with erm  Wendy's parents and we would do quite well with the joint knowledge of four of us.
It's your competitive instinct coming out again.
You're trying to win.
One of the questions erm, there was a  one of the categories was quiz shows  so I thought well I, I don't, I won't do very well here cos I just don't watch enough  and one of the questions was, who was the helper on erm  My, on Take Your Pick?
The old Take Your Pick.
Well one of the ones that u that used to Take Your Pick?
Who sha well Michael Mi 
That was Michael Miles.
Michael Miles used to do it.
Who was the helper?
On Take Your, on Take Your Pick.
Bob  Walker.
Well, you see, er we didn't know that.
Yo yo if you'd have been there we'd have done well.
And then it was who was the helper on Double Your Money?
Well we fi 
Hughey Green and er 
finally got to Monica and we thought that was enough, so we just wrote Monica, we thought they'd accept that and they did n't.
Th the  we didn't get the full marks we, we didn't get 
I can't remember her name.
Monica Rose.
Oh.
But you see, if we'd had yous and then, we were doing qui quite well up until 
Well I wasn't around.
I was at 
then, then we got the sport and we didn't do so well on that.
Oh well.
Did you do the filters on this yesterday?
Erm  I rinsed out the bottom of the , yes.
Alright.
Why would they leave those poles?
I mean they were there at lunchtime when I came home and there was nobody with them so I assumed they'd knocked off for lunch.
And then
I think somebody's trying to upset you.
I is that all they're trying to do?
Because it's frustrating 
Well no, I don't know, but 
to put them there and then 
I wouldn't er 
leave them there.
they've lined one up at each end of the field so it, it looks like they're saying, well, you know that's a parcel of land.
Yeah.
But, I don't know.
I mean I, I reckon it'd be nice if they, they sort of parcel it up and then sell some of it
Go round and ask.
No.
Why not?
I don I don't know whether I want to  spend er, you know, so much money on that.
Well would you rather do that or have a conservatory?
Well it  the land would cost  so much  more than the conserv I don't know if I want to spend so much money here, I'd rather 
You do Yes but, you don't know how much er, I mean, you can't sell it for housing  at the moment.
He looks always 
And he's not getting 
strapped for cash.

I mean, you know, everything's plate one, have you ever seen plate two, three or four or?
Mm mm.
Oh!
I think they go to two and three but they don't go very far.
Michael  's alright.
The paperwork must cost quite a lot  that they keep pushing out.
Why?
I mean  the plates'll cost pennies to make.
Look at this, all this
Mm mm.
and there's no mention of the price.
Oh!
It'll be on here somewhere.
No, they are, they, they do  they, they are pretty good.
There.
It's all listed out properly.
Nineteen ninety.
So oh here it is.
That's the sort of thing Geoffrey might like.
Erm
What?
Well that's a thought.
What?
Erm  when we sell that flat we were gonna give Geoffrey and Jean something.
Well  that's a 
Yeah I 
nice for present Geoffrey but not for Jean.
Not 
Yeah, but you get Jean something as well.
No, don't you think that's going a bit over the top?
Well  it's up to you.
I'll buy them  a bunch of flowers !
That's a better one.
Here's a second plate, it's a lank.
Takes me back to Scampton.
Oh yes, that's nice.
I like that better than the other one.
Yes that's plate two.
Coalforth.
Nineteen twenty.
Yes that's better.
I like that.
I'm, I'm a bit confused, thinking about work yesterday, I'm a bit confused about who, who's .
Erm  Steve   for some reason I thought he was a tall  man, but he's quite short isn't he?
Yeah.
Just when he's 
Is he 
on the football field.
He can jump.
Steve, the fair haired little 
is he the one 
one.
well, who's the one 
 
the dif a while ago drove down  Middle Street and crashed into some, that one?
That was Ian , he doesn't work there.
Oh!
I'm mixing the two people.
Ian  's tall.
But he 
Isn't he?
Yeah.
he doesn't look anything like him.
So Steve  's quite respectable?
Yeah.
They're all nice lads.
Mm.
Well he seemed quite nice and I thought, well are you the one that 
Ian's alright, he just gets drunk.
Mm mm.
But he's recently married that  lass with the ready-made family so
Oh well.
No I just thought he was quite pleasant.
I mean he was always quite helpful when I 
Steve's, Steve is 
didn't know anything 
Steve's very pleasant.
He's a nice lad.
but I thought, well is he the one
He's intelligent as well.
He, he er yes, he  I mean they were all quite helpful.
Pete  was, was quite helpful too.
Mm.
I thought  to Janet  when I last see him .
It's alright.
Janet should come to work shouldn't she?
Do you think she'll  turn up on Monday?
Oh I would think so.
She's got the most  abysmal sickness record!
She'll  rigid cos her pay stopped at one stage and  it was wrong because she hadn't been warned
Mm mm.
but erm  she did a  threw a wobbler about it and 
Mm.
then when we checked into it
It was right.
and you got her sickness record it  it was, well it's
What's the matter with her?
they nearly paid her  erm early forties and a spinster.
Oh Phillip!
That's 
D'ya know what I mean?
very sexist.
I don't like that.
Is she in her early forties?
Yes.
Forty one I think.
You mean she's my age?
I thought she was older than me.
There you are, you see.
No I think  
She's, she's, she's typical of the
Now now!
of the eight cats
Oh I know she is.
Mm.
living on your own syndrome.
So I think it's the cats she catches anything from.
She worries and frets all the time.
It's cos she's nobody to talk to.
Mm.
That's what  Julie and I were saying that  when you live on your own you get a bit like that.
Oh!
She, she gets all wound up at home and then comes to work and  where there's people to sound off about, everything under the  er the sun.
We were saying about John, we was talking about John  as well.
Yeah.
And the fact he can't just accept things, he has to question things.
And we were talking about M E, and how
Oh he's a very intense person.
how Dave, I was saying about Dave and how he's sort of taken, taken a completely different attitude to things.
More relaxed.
But 
If he, if he couldn't do anything then he would accept it and not do it and then try a bit and if he had to  go back to bed.
I mean he gave up work for a long time didn't he?
Yeah.
But it's such a  sort of thing 
And the contrast in personalities though, they're just  
Well there's a contrast in personality and you don't really know whether anybody's got the same thing because nobody's narrowed it down 
No, oh no, I mean 
down.
Yeah you can't.
All they know is that they're
But Julie was saying 
different.
about that sleeping treatment that he took,tha that finished him off because he, he, he 
Yes but 
staked so much on that and we were, we were agreeing 
Oh yes I know.
that the reason he didn't sleep was because the fact that he was just sitting around all day.
So you wouldn't sleep 
But they didn't 
then your body doesn't need it.
they didn't do it properly though.
Oh!
That was the other thing she said, that he, he should have be gone into hospital.
Course he should.
He tried to do it at home and that was 
They co 
ridiculous!
did he have the opportunity to go into hospital to have it done?
Erm, well the 
I would have thought 
Yeah.
so because erm 
I mean Paul said, with the blokes down in London and he, he ga gave them the pills and sa told them that they go back home and so he did.
Yes but the, Julie said, and she's right of course, you can't have the erm  strength of drugs to, to, to administer at home because obviously
It wasn't, it wasn't
you've got to be monitored on that sort of thing.
You can't be put into 
it wasn't done right.
a deep drugs and ni not have erm  some medical staff  monitoring you.
Yeah it sounds like you did a lot of work yesterday.
I told you we tal I talked, I, I disturbed her all day long.
Oh look!
What?
Why is that?
What is it?
Oh!
I was going to say it was just something stuck on  the 
It's te I'll pick it up,i if it  it was rust on the .
No, no.
It, it, it 
No, now that I've seen it.
while I was sitting from here I could erm  see it had something stuck on it.
The sheep seemed to have thinned out.
Mm mm.
I think they must be up that other end cos th there's about a couple of dozen yesterday I noticed.
Only two down here.
They're not eating our hedge.
No, see that one that's going up near where I planted granddad's honeysuckle?
Mhm.
They erm,they er   there was a lamb nibbling that yesterday and he's taken off,so the bits at the top and the bottom  have no connection any longer so
Oh!
It's not, I don't think that's granddad's honeysuckle.
I must go out and check it.
I don't know where granddad's is.
No, it's ju it's just down there.
But that was a wispy one, granddad's was ever so big.
No, granddad's  never really took off 
With big leaves.
because of the  of the drought.
When we were away it didn't get watered on.
I used to water it every day.
Well everything looks as though it's had a good water now.
All four lilac trees have taken anyway.
I want to check that the 
Did I tell me when we got up to erm  Newcastle we turned on the local news, they'd had five inches of rain  which is a winter's rain in four days.
Mm mm.
The Metro station just down from  Gosforth Park er was flooded to platform level.
Oh .
Like d'ya, do you remember Sheffield 
And all the overheads were 
flooded last year?
Yeah.
And, and everywhere you went the fields  waterlogged 
Actually standing in water.
Standing in water all the way up.
Snow on the hills and everything.
Mm.
But fortunately, you know, we, we only got  tail end of it, a bit of sleet.
Whereabouts did you go yesterday?
You know you said  there was a bus coming at half past eight.
Where did 
Erm 
you go?
I couldn't 
to 
I couldn't quite imagine what you were doing.
went round the erm  British Gas research establishment.
Oh!
Was it mu was it very interesting?
Amazing!
Amazing!
And  very impressed.
The  it's a massive place and, you know, five or six hundred staff, and erm, it's where they  develop all the new technology for the  gas fields  delivery of gas to your house and everything.
But you see they're spending a lot of the time  you know, on  developing ways of repairing roads after they've been in them.
And what's impressive is they're doing research that we should have been doing for years!
I mean, it's a bit much when the gas board is there showing us
How to research  
how, it's developed materials, it's developed techniques and everything for mending roads.
So  it's er  a bit humbling.
So did you learn something?
Yeah.
Quite a lot.
You see when the erm  legislation changes shortly, well the legislation is there but  when it's enacted  erm  they  they will become responsible for repairing after their own hole digging  and they have to provide us with guarantees.
Certain standard and time to do it in.
Yes, but I've, they've got to guarantee the repair for at least two years after they've done it.
Ah I see.
So, British Gas, the commercial, have worked out that there's only one way to do that, you do the job properly to start with.
Mm.
Yes.
And so, they're putting all the effort into doing it.
Mm.
Well they 
And er 
don't wanna, amount of time of coming back again to do it haven't 
It's 
they?
well that's lost money isn't it?
Mm mm.
So  no it was very impressive.
I'll  I think it's a bit much when you have highway engineers there and  really  they were showing us how it should be done.
And er 
Mm mm.
they proved, you know, some things, certain rollers and stuff that  we thought were useless, you know Paddy's dancing partner?
Oh yeah .
Erm  well we thought that was out of fashion.
They've shown that  if you run it at the right speed and stuff it's one of the most effective  methods of doing it  and erm  the ones we say are the nice little plate compactors which are  the best thing, they are useless in comparative performance so
Mhm.
er  no it was, good.
The money they spend on research!
I forget what it was, the turnover was erm  something like eight billion.
Or was it  no i er it, probably eight hundred billion.
It was in some figure you can't even relate to.
So
Well they must have a lot of money.
Isn't it British Gas' Chairman that's just had that enormous pay rise?
Well I think most of them have.
Oh yes, but the Gas one has.
But I mean th the  the standard of entertainment, I mean  put, putting 
 
us all in that hotel for
Somebody was saying  rang in complained to Peter  about the, the amount of, what, what are they getting?
It's not, it's not quarter of a million is it?
It's about two hundred thousand.
Prob probably something like that.
And Peter said well what would you consider  a reasonable salary for him?
And I thought he would say something like, you know something really silly, about fifty, sixty thousand, but he said  I think a hundred and fifty thousand's enough.
And, I thought well, it is really isn't it?
Probably is.
And for, for somebody who was ringing in, an ordinary person just complaining
Mm.
I, I do think they have rather gone over the top.
Well, there you are.
If you want to attract the right people and keep them you have to pay them money.
Yeah but, don't, I'm sure there must be a lot of right people who will work for a hundred and fifty thousand.
Probably not.
Well
The other thing that was interesting I learnt at dinner on  Thursday night is, under the  government's legislation within so many years, nineteen ninety four I think, they've got to ha have reduced their market share from the original hundred percent  to sixty percent  as new firms come in to  sell gas
Yes.
Now, as the bloke said there, the only way you can do that with people coming in from the outside is that British Gas  have got to keep pushing their prices up to make it worthwhile for somebody else to come in.
For the competition to get in.
You can't just suddenly say well we're not gonna supply this quarter or something unless there's somebody coming in
Mm mm.
to do it.
To make it commercially attractive to somebody else British Gas have to got keep lifting their prices to a level, that eventually somebody comes in and says oh yes 
It's worth my while  
it's worth me having a go.
Yeah.
I asked them if once they'd got rid of the forty percent they could then get it back  by dropping the prices, you know, they've, they've 
By, by competing.
satisfied them legally?
Yeah.
They weren't sure about that.
But, they, they thought they'd probably struggle.
I thought, just assumed they would have known.
Well,ye I'm not dealing with the marketing people was I?
No.
I was, dealing with the engineering people.
Right.
If you're clearing up I'll go upstairs  and er
Yeah.
Yes, I think you're right .
Oh no, there's some more sheep sitting over there.
Under th under that tree that is left.
Mm mm.
Nothing from the insurance company was there?
No.
Oh yes, I wonder
You wonder what?
I wonder what they've decided to
Well  it's out of our hands.
It's just very important that 
I hope you remembered to pick up those    discs last night.
I can't understand why he, I mean he had nothing to do with it.
And Lorna did her own sheet didn't she?
We, we did our own.
Didn't Lorna fill in her own sheet?
Yes.
So.
Well they said it was me and Lorna.
Yeah.
Well I  that it was you.
Yeah.
But we've ended up with, they've got the prize and we're the ones who did it, who, who did it.
Who did do it.
I'm not worried about it.
Well it 
I say it's a compact disc when you haven't got a compact disc player 
When you ha haven't got a player 
it er
but neither have they, it's a, thing is this 
it's a bit of a luxury.
Well I thought I would use it as a raffle prize at school or something.
Give it straight back into something.
No use 
Okay.
to us, I can't see us ge 
Anyway, I'll be down in a minute.
can't see us ever having a compact disc player.
No.
Dave.
Come on.
Get a move on this morning.
Oh!
Phillip the tape's going .
What?
Well I can't hold a conversation on my own.
Why not?
Well, I'm not very good at that sort 
What?
of thing.
We're going to do the mower.
Okay?
Yes.
Yes.
So I'm gonna fetch it round.
Erm
yeah, I don't think I can do the big mower.
I couldn't get the right bolts.
 
Oh.
And we went to try and get Chris some trainers.
It wouldn't hurt for some of them throwing away but none the right size of course.
Yes.
Well what size is he?
And, so I popped in and asked Douglas if he'd got any going for next to nothing but he doesn't have anything down his size.
No.
But we really ought to er 
Oh he does, he needs some trainers.
Erm 
Yeah.
Well I mean he 
I'll go, I'll
I thought I'd take him into Woollies or the market or something.
Well not the market.
But er
Well, do you want to go to Phillips and, I mean he kicks them out in two weeks.
Oh I was gonna say haven't Clarkes got some cheap ones in?
Him and trainers  soon
What about Toby  in Bridlington?
Pardon?
What about Toby  if we get some, he desperately needs some because he 
Yes but
he desperately 
but, but I mean yes but when 
Could wear last year's.
when you go to a, but th th 
Phillip 
question is, are we getting him quality like you and I would want
Oh no!
or are we getting him ones that he can kick to pieces?
Well just  I mean usu 
How much 
in the summer I usually get him some trainers er cheap, the cheapest trainers anyway, but I mean yes it's time he has them.
But you know on the  but there's a shoe shop near that one and
That was .
I know the one you mean.
Aha.
Yeah.
And 
We got, we got some cheap trainers from there 
Yes.
once didn't I?
You also got them on a 
No you got these ones up in Woollies didn't you?
Well okay.
But they never .
Yeah.
Anyhow.
As long as you get the proper size.
Yes.
The mower stuff 
Do the thing, alright.
and then, then we'll do that.
Are you helping with that Chris?
What?
Th the mower's out the shed, can you fetch it right the way over here then please?
Is it, is it warm out there?
Well, it's, it's perhaps a bit cool without 
Er yes, yes.
a coat on.
Okay.
Well I'll, I'll 
But I wouldn't describe it as warm.
Can you shut the door and I'll, I'll ring David.
Bye.
Bye.
Now how are you getting on?
Mum.
Yes?
You see that?
That's entrance for  look at the back.
Yes.
You go in there  and there's a little ticket office inside.
Yeah.
Then you come out here onto the platform.
Can you get a tissue and blow your nose cos you have  such a runny cold.
Is there some
Ee!
Ee!
in  mum?
There's some in there in the sitting room.
Off you go.
Go on, quickly.
This .
Yes it is.
You've got lots of them.
Have you got the full set now?
No you haven't have you?
There's Donald and Duck 
No I I've got two of those, Harold and Donald and this one.
They ke 
Yeah.
every time we think 
You haven't.
every time we think we've got the full set they  bring out some more.
Yeah.
I think my favourite is Trevor the Traction Engine.
Ah yeah.
Oh yeah.
Go on, get that tissue.
Get your nose blown.
This is spotless.
Well yo you only got that at Christmas so you haven't played with it much.
Come on!
Get that nose blown.
Look there's Christopher taking that old lawnmower across for daddy to mend.
I suppose we ought to go out and give him a hand really but
That
maybe later on.
that  we still use that one!
We're keeping that one, it's the old, really old one we're going to put into that auction.
It's the really, really old one.
The one that's at the back of the shed.
I just 
Yeah.
want that one to do the edges with and daddy'll ride round to do, or I will, or you will, no you won't, or Chrissy will  to do the middle bit.
The grass has got very long hasn't it?
Yeah.
It looks very green now it's had all that rain.
Have you blown your nose properly?
Go and throw that one away and get me another one and I'll help you.
Mum.
And then you can come and tell me all about 
I ha 
your game.
I've had Duck for a long time.
Yes.
Oh it's Donald and Douglas is, is, are those  will you go and get those tissues sorted out please?
I've still got the two twins to get.
Douglas 
Well 
and Douglas and Bill and Ben.
Well we'll have to see what happens at Christmas.
But Christmas is a long way away.
I've got Douglas' friends to get yet.
What did you need them for?
Bring me a tissue for you?
Ar do yo are you hoping to get the full set?
Come here.
Blow.
So I wanna change it for it's my first, my Fat Controller's Railway.
Now keep that in your pocket and keep that nose clean 
Yeah.
please.
It's the only way to get rid of that cold.
My first engine in the Fat Controller's Railway was Thomas.
Yes that's right.
Then it was Edward, then Henry  then Gordon, then James, then Percy .
Then Percy.
Yeah.
Then Toby
Toby the Tram.
And Henrietta  the coach.
Then it was Duck.
Did we make a coach for, for Toby,Henrie can you buy Henrietta?
Yes you can buy them.
Do you want a Henrietta as well?
Oh yes please mum!
Mum.
Yes?
If I had loads of room in  house I'd put them all together.
Put them e behind Gordon.
Yes but, I don't think Gordon, it's only Thomas that really has any caravan, sometimes Percy isn't it?
The, the  larger engines, the express engines don't.
Maybe James.
I thought er
Cos it's usually the er  the tender engines don't  pull  caravan do they?
Yes.
It's only the tankers isn't it?
But mum!
Look  you can't get the express coaches.
No.
But mum 
Why, why 
Mum.
I just think Tom's looking very battered.
The cabs are very chipped.
It's, I think you have to take a bit more care of those.
Cos you will throw them at the back of the box instead of lining them up.
D'ya remember how I got that box where you could lay them in  separately?
And of course you're not being very careful.
You're not a very careful with your toys young man are you?
But mum
Mhm?
you, you ca you can get a bo you can get a set of, you can get a board for these to get room on  so you 
Mhm.
Yeah.
A big, a big board.
I don't think we really need that do we now?
No.
Apparently it isn't a very big one.
Well, well you've got 
All over 
the board that you set out the Lego on, you could run those on that.
That's taking up enough room 
It is 
we do I don't think we've got any more space.
The board's damaged from, cos that board's damaged beca from Duck, from Duck to Diesel.
D'ya know I'd forgotten it's got dirty beads on.
It's a long time since you've had this set out.
Ooh yes!
Well keep them all together this time.
Or that'll get trod on.
Ooh!
There's that .
Got Thomas.
How come you've got two Thomas?
Oh!
Yo you bought another Thomas with Annie and Clarabel, is that 
Yeah.
is that the one?
I bought, we bought the Thomas second  and then we 
Second one.
got one Thomas with Annie and Clarabel.
Mm.
Oh.
Mum.
Yes?
You know when we did gold paint on James' ?
Yes.
It's red paint.
Mm mm.
Whoops.
Looks good in there.
They're not in the right pair are they?
Unfortunately, the Fat Controller.
No they do come .
Mm.
Not actually, I think you can get different sizes can't you?
Just those and erm  small and that it's difficult to find, those are like the very small ones, they have a picture on there.
Tt.
But mum
But I don't think the Fat Controller's supposed to be quite as nice is he?
Are you finding they're not particularly ?
Mine are all staying there.
Oh..
?
Yeah.
You know these two they, cos they  set don't they?
They come together, yes.
But I think you've  got different sizes there.
Well, mum
And probably only bigger ones.
they came as the same  they came in the same colour mu thing round them we in the red letters saying what they are.
Mm.
The same packaging.
Yeah.
Same package, package.
Mm mm.
Cos you can get the bigger
Mm mm.
got the bigger Thomas haven't you?
Got two of them the one that, that pushes one round.
Hey mum!
You, you can get a toy the same as the Fat Controller there.
Mm mm.
A really big one, that big!
They're that big.
Well I don't, I haven't seen one that size.
That big.
It's probably  yes.
Maybe a bit smaller.
No.
Bu I think it's Fat Controller bubble bath.
Oh!
I see what you mean .
I think 
Yeah.
I think it is.
Well I think it was made of a squidgy thing.
Now, I was only thinking this morning when I was in your bathroom  you've got lots of bubble bath left over from Christmas.
You've still got some left over from the year before, but people keep giving you it.
Mm.
Chrissy's still got that turtle bubble bath that he doesn't want anybody to use.
And you've got the same one.
And then er  pots with the squidgy soap in.
Oh yeah!
And then there's another tall bottle that Wendy got you.
You've still got the lot from last year that David and Wendy got you and you've 
You soap 
still got this year's.
I think it's about time you used some of that.
I, I'm the only person who used the squidgy soap.
Didn't we have to stop using it because Chrissy was coming out in a rash?
No .
No.
And we didn't know what it was.
No because I was,ha because I had the diarrhoea.
Did you?
Yeah.
That was the reason we that was when we stopped using the turtle stuff.
D'ya know, I don't know.
Mm mm.
Well we'll start using it again.
Start using the stuff ta cos there's another big bottle in the cupboard as well in your bathroom.
Yes.
No point in saving it.
You may as well use it.
Mm mm.
Mum.
Yes?
You know of that music which goes with the engines?
Mm.
Well as soon as you know, knowing it too well.
.
Oh we must make sure on Tuesday we're home to record, what time is the  on?
It starts at five to four doesn't it?
I must get the tape lined up so that it's ready to switch on when we come home cos it's gonna be, walk home from school if it's a nice day, we'll, we'll have to hurry home.
Cos we usually walk slowly don't we?
So we're not getting home till about four o'clock.
But if we, we erm
Hurry.
Well if it's, if it's  if the weather's not very good I'll meet you in the car, but if it's a nice day I, I'd much rather walk to meet you.
But mum we did go in th the car.
You said, it's erm  at five past five.
No we, we walked and I, I got the time wrong didn't we?
Cos we came in and Chrissy, instead of switching on the children's programmes put his computer on so we didn't see it.
Well we 
But of course it's five to four isn't it?
It's the beginning of the programmes rather than the end.
Never mind.
We've only missed one.
Mum.
I hadn't even got the tape lined up ready to  the next, the next one on.
So I'll have to get it set up ready for when I meet you from school and then we can switch it on as soon as we get home.
Well that's what Chrissy did see.
Well we'll remember.
The Tuesday after that we go on holiday, it's the Easter holidays.
Can you move your foot mum.
I'm sorry.
You're ri you're right on the railway.
I'm standing on the railway?
Oh, I better move out the way, I might get squashed.
If we got this Monopoly game finished we could get this cleared up couldn't we?
It's been going on a few days this game.
I think Chrissy's got a  although I'm not sure actually, you might win.
You've got two sets haven't you?
And quite a lot of money.
Have you got houses  on your set?
Yes you have.
You've got a house on .
I started off quite well.
I've got Mayfair  Piccadilly, Fleet Street and Regent Street, but I never got a set did I?
Mum, how much, how much do you want for Fleet Street?
Well
Then I'll have just three sets.
Yes.
If I land on  something where  I need some money.
Chris has got quite a lot of, he's got Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road.
Although, they don't cost much to buy though.
a few houses on them.
You can earn  some money.
So I might need, if I land on that I'll probably have to sell Fleet Street to be able to survive.
And I think once I do that I shall have lost out because Chris has got Park Lane and he's not going to part with those.
So I don't think I'm going to do very well .

And you can try everything on
And it isn't, it's not big enough to get all the engines on.
Is it big enough to put  put, put Gordon on?
Well Gordon's a very big engine.
The biggest of all of the engines on the Fat Controller's Railway.

Inside where the tapes go.
Are you enjoying your Chronicles of Narnia?
Tt.
Er
I think Chrissy is isn't he?
Well mum

Well  I think you're a bit young to enjoy it, at the moment but er Christopher is.
We must go and spend your book token so we can write to  Gwyneth and thank her.
Which reminds me you still haven't written to Geoffrey and Jean to thank them for your birthday money have we?
So mum, I know I haven't.
Or have you, which is more to the point.
The other night  cos I didn't like  you wrote about telling Gwyneth about I don't like the Chronicles of Narnia.
Well, fortunately she understood.
What are you going to put in your letter to Geoffrey and Jean?
And
I don't know what I got from them.
They gave you a cheque.
Oh yes, that's right.
I've put it into the bank and I shall give you the money.
Now what are you going to buy?
Books.
You can get some books if you want but Gwyneth's given you some money for books as well.
I'll get some Thomas books.
There is quite a lot I haven't got.
You could actually buy erm  Trevor.
No, Terence, Terence the Tractor to go with your set.
Mm.
Well, mum 
Cos Geoffrey likes trains doesn't he?
You could write to Geoffrey and say  say you've bought something to do with trains and should feel very pleased.
I don't want to buy, I don't want to buy a bulldozer!
What has that got to do with trains?
Terence the Tractor's part of

Oh.
Strange child!
Mum.

What I want to do  wha with the bulldozer I got I would like to poke it that  shovel one.
One of those interesting conversations with Thomas, like, which are better  train wheels or tractor wheels.
The caterpillar wheels.
Oh yeah.
Cos do you remember then Terence can get through the snow where Thomas can't.
Yes.
And Terence comes to Thomas' rescue, cos Thomas doesn't like that snow plough does he?
No he banged it so he can't 
He banged it so that it would bend.
He's very naughty.
Yes.
Because that's why he was cheeky.
Probably cos he's  puffed up in the snow box and comes to see to him.
He was going to rescue Mrs .
Was it Mrs ?
Yeah.
I think he .
Sh he did.
She was waving to him.
It is Mrs .
Is that the name?
Oh we haven't read that for a while cos you read them to yourself now don't you?
So I don't get to read 
Ah 
them any more.
On that?
Yeah.
I still like people reading to me though.
Six people still read to me.
Quite a lot of people read.
No oh.
I don't often have people reading to me.
Well you're such a good reader yourself now, you don't need anyone to tell it 
Wow!

You're quite right it is nice to have people to read to you.
And you've read for me in bed before now haven't you?
Oh!
Oh yes!
You've come and read me a bed time story when I haven't been very well and I've been in bed.
Yes  Park.
And mum?

And Chrissy read to me  what was it?
It was a Roald Dahl book.
. I like George's Magic Medicine books best.
Mum.
Yes?
I  mum.
What?
Which was it?
Was it Jack, was it James and the Giant Peach?
No it wasn't.
It was something about
Crocodiles.
No it wasn't.
It was, it was James and the Giant, it was about this boy being ill-treated by these two old ladies that were looking after James.
I suppose  no I, I didn't enjoy that one but, I could see that Chrissy enjoyed it.
Thought it was wonderful.
Oh mum.
Yes.
I thought  I thought you were on about a book that 
 

Yes?
We're just going up to Eastgate Bike Shop to try and get a cable that just snapped
Right.

Okay.
Right.
Alright Dave?
Yes dad.
Do you want to go with daddy?
Pardon?
Do you want to go?
Well we're only going up to Eastgate now Jane.

I think this is going to be too late for you children.
The meeting starts at seven, the quiz is seven thirty to eight fifteen, then there's an interval and then the rest of the quiz is nine to nine thirty, well  you won't be home till ten o'clock.
No.
It's no good.
It's a shame cos you would have enjoyed it.
Are all the que are, are all the questions about trains?
No.
It says,the quiz will contain some sixty questions covering general knowledge and not just railway so  so that there is , not very good grammar,so that there is nothing for the family to be  afraid of  .
Which is .
Well mum, I want to go.
Oh no, sweetie pie.
If it had been the following week with school holidays but I, I do think you'd be very tired the next day.
I wouldn't mind.
And a pie and pea supper in the interval.
A what of?
A pie and pea, a charge, two pound fifty.
Wow wee!
Wow wee!
Bring your family and friends.
I think it means they're all just  older family, I don't think it means six year olds.
Mm.
So you think, do they think I'm a baby.
I wonder if daddy wants to go.
I shall have to see if I can get a sitter for you two children.
Now what were you asking there?
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
Darling.
Did you ask me something?
Er, no.
Oh!

I haven't had Toby out  for a while.
It's Toby's turn.

It's funny, cos Toby's the only steam tram I know.
Mm mm.
Mum.
Mm mm?
You need to steer it, you never ste you  with Thomas.
Yes.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Cos there are real engines in there.
But, if they're, the real engines don't have faces.
Yes that's right.
And they think that was Melissico.
Yes.
Yes rather than er doing the talking.
You're right, Melissico didn't have any.
But it did.
But, the real engine  which is
Yes.
But mum
What?
er, this had  that night  er but, one, in one bit it said  he said  that night they di fa found that Melissico wasn't   enjoyed talking to them long af till long after the stars came out.
That's right.
Yeah.
Direct quote from the book.
You did very well.
No!
No!
From television.
Yes but they take it from the book.
They keep it as close to the book as they can.
Yes.
Well, no point in changing it.
Oh mum.
Mm mm?
Do you know when Gordon goes rushing through the station ?
Mhm.
Well, well  well in the book it said  that, that, that  that er this Gordon's er  is, he's er, he's trying to do a  Truro.
Yes .
But on the television it says, it doesn't do that.
Er, well you know because you read the books 
It's only there 
very carefully.
for today.
Do you remember when Gordon went rushing through when he'd got his whistles out?
Yeah.
And the 
Aha.
story books .
That was one of the earlier stories.
Yes.
That was the first one where Dot gets cold.
Mm.
I like that book.
I like the earlier stories better than the recent ones.
Mum.
I'm not, not so keen on those.
I like the books, the original books that I had when I was a little rather than the new books.
Books of Thomas?
Yes.
Mm.
The pictures are nicer in those books.
But mum  er
Well I think so.
whose were they?
David, Annie, May.
No.
But they belonged to my brother .
Ah!
They've give me that.
Mum.
I'll erm 
It is kind of but they len to le lend them their Thomas books
Mm.
and I didn't take the ones I already had.
Well they haven't got any children in their family so they put  
Well but 
children.
Mum.
There was,the there were two they had that I had got.
So er, they had  The Big Engine and I, I've read that so  but the small railway engines.
Aha.
Oh!
I must stop yawning .
I wish I could  I wish I had a bit more energy this morning.
Mum, this is only just a yard.
Yes, you've got it looking like the yard.
Where are the engines now?
You could do the turntable in front.
Cos that's how it is in the book isn't it?
When they .
Or facing that to go on the turntable.
Yes.
And mum.
Mind your head lovey.
You're very close 
You see the 
to that table.
have you noticed
Mm mm?
that  you know erm all like tracks which lead into the sheds
Oh!
Excuse me.
Yeah .
Well I was gonna say it didn't have erm  have  lines, they were on the side.
Well that's right, yes.
So that they can be turned onto the track like going to the  goods show.
Yes.
They've got .
Mhm mm.
Cos Gordon wanted to go to straight through this   and th the turn table.
Can you think of another way of turning the engine without using the turntable?
Of course!
Can you?
I'll use, I'll use Duck.
Just demonstrate it for me.
Mm mm.
Have you ever seen an engine go on a coach like, kerb like that?
What was the shape we were talking about yesterday?
It's a triangle.
That's right.
It's got a  curve on each end.
Yeah?
And what is the matter with that?
That's it.
And then it goes backwards.
No actually it doesn't have a curve, it is a triangle but it's got a longer base hasn't it?
It would extend so that it could just jump back.
Right.
To there.
Mm.
Up to the top.
Then you can get an engine tuned without using the turntable  these .
Like
Cos James is pointing, it goes backwards.
You've got engines facing in opposite directions.
Oh.
Ha!
I'll walk.
Take one of these off mum.
Oh!
That's daddy and Christopher back again.
That didn't take them long did it?
I hope they've got the bits now.
I really ought to go and help them seeing as we're .
Mm.
Oh mum!
Mhm mm.
Oh mum!
Tt!
Did you cut  oh well you've cut them up alright.
No!
I don't want to chop them up .
Yes.
There's one man  I was go was always good at playing with those  lost my

Yes, that's all we ever do.
But then when you got a ta th the new one is that when you've got the tape recorder on you go wo ho ho ho ho ho!
Though sometimes, when they've been smashed into  and then I have to turn the other way, they go oh!
Horror struck aren't they half the time.
Somebody as asked to keep it.
Well
When James and Tara had it, d'ya remember?
Oh yes.
And mum 
Well, that's just 
in the brake, in the brake van.
Oh that's the other one.
Yes.
The brake van.
The face was on the other end  and it was looking really surprised.
Yes.
What sort of face did he have then  to make it look surprised?
How did they draw a face?
Er
At school there.
Er  No.
Make his mouth wide open and the  the eyebrows 
Well I ha 
were up weren't they?
Like that.
Yes that's it.
Do it like this?
A bit No do it u the mouth open a bit more.
It's only tripped up  and trip over there don't you?
Instead the eyes are looking  rather smiling, they're looking  surprised , or they're frightened.
Or they're laughing.
Mm mm.
Mum.

diddle diddle ee, da da da, da da.
Ba ba .
We can either take erm
The reason I put it in the Post Office years ago was erm
cos you didn't have to pay tax cos you're a non-taxpayer  and everybody that went to a building society got it taxed.
But then they also  you can register as a non-taxpayer.
Anybody can.
You only have to ask.
Well you have to be a non-tax payer, you can't cheat.
Mm.
But it's obvious at your age  that you won't be a tax payer.
Not that you've got  
I'm not one 
You could give all your money to me and say  there I'm not tax paying .
Yes, I must admit tha that's a possibility but er

Not all the of them, just a couple.
And that helps you get the game started.
Yeah, that was quite good.
Well I don't mean to shorten the time, it's better than playing all day.

Is it because it, I mean  can you give me a reason?
You were so keen to get all that Lego and you've got tons of Lego and yo you're not playing with it.
Any particular reason?
Yeah but, yeah  it's funny cos, cos  it's funny cos I got that new Lego  you didn't at all.

Mm mm.
It's just we got the board and it's taking up all the room in the playroom  and yet you're not playing with it.

Why?
Is there some reason?
But can we ju 
Well  cos I got very little Lego.

Yeah.
Can I take that 
Can I just 
it's this thing about this Lego piece
I'm talking to Christopher.

It's alright.
No, it's erm  because you, do the same thing over and over again that you find  and no haven't got  big  lots of er, when you went to the small amount of the town.
But you've got lots of Lego.
Even, I've never seen it all set up at the same time.
The police station, the fire station  I think there was a harbour as well.
Yeah.
No.
You've got
I like the airport 
the airport.
I know.
I haven't got an airport, I've got an aeroplane and a helicopter, I haven't got an airport.
Well can't you sort of build yo you've got all the other Lego that  and the red 
Mum!
I used 
Mhm.
remember the, the red and the whites and grey Lego that I , you've got that, why can't you build something with that?
Cos it's 
I can.
mixed up!
Why don't you make, build houses 
 
with that?
Yes as long as you o you use it.
I mean, it, it doesn't have to  
It's all been mixed up with the
Well tha that doesn't 
the other one.
matter.
Why just don't you  use all the Lego, build something.
I mean, you can use the Duplo to build something couldn't you?
Mm.
Mum, the Duplo's up there.
Chris, I remember when   me and Chrissy used to play with it  tha Du mainly Duplo but we had some other  tt  like the Lego.
I'm just a bit disappointed that th there really is a lot of money's worth of Lego and you're not playing with it.
He will..
This.
What I'd like is the erm  there's the airport 
Can you 
and there's this sort of  airport monorail.
Yes.
It's very good.
It's, it's la it's like a railway
Yeah.
in sort of Lego.
This monorail goes around, it stops at the bo the bottom stage and it goes over the top stage.
Mm.
It sounds quite good then.
But er
It costs a hu a hundred pound.
you wanted, you wanted lots of Lego, you've got lots of Lego 
station.
now I'm, I don't feel like spending any more on Lego now Chris.
And we can, Chrissy we can make a space monorail.
Unless you want some bits  from down there.
Well  we need some standing posts.
That's what we need.
If you're not gonna play with the Lego Chrissy, can you pack some into the boxes and I'll put that board away.
Mm mm.
Then we'll get back into the playroom again.
Mm.
Shall we sell it then?
I don't know.
Well I, I'm so disappointed.
What sell all our Legos!
Well 
Don't!
that was what you really wanted.
Do you remember that long letter you wrote at Christmas?
Mm.
I just haven't worked out
No, Monopoly's better than Lego.
Excuse me.
Run out of.
Dee dee dee dee .
Oh I thought it was informal.
I'd like to believe that er
David!
David wants to go to bed.
I know he does.
Do you want to go to bed David? 

I think you're as well on, on the sofa with er
Why what's up?
the rug.
Go to bed.
Go on then.
Mhm.
Not, not like him to ever want to go to bed truly.
He had a late night 
Do you want your tea over there or do you want it
No I'll bring it, I wanna go over there.
We're going to be late to dinner tonight aren't we I think?
Ah.
The time's .
Nothing's boiling.
Well that's true.
If we  were you thinking of going to Health Chardonne?
Well  yes, because er A 
Only I thought 
if they deliver it it's  cheaper than going to Scunny or 
Well yes, but we've still got the problem of erm
But if, if we go in my car to fetch it I can't take the kids.
I know.
I know.
Well, which means I can't come.
I thought it'd be nice if we all went together.
But you mean go during the week some time?
No, I wasn't thinking of any time.
Erm  you could take two cars if you want to.
No, I think that's a bit of a waste.
I thought you might have time during the week to pop into Hull that was all.
A lunchtime 
No.
or something.
I could come with you.
Well I don't know.
I really don't know.
You don't know what a normal week is now do you?
Anyway popping into Hull is a thing of the past isn't it?
I suppose it is.
Well how much are their delivery charges?
Well I don't know.
Ten, fifteen quid I should think.
Ee ooh!
Well it's worth asking anyway isn't it?
Mm.
If they'd left one of these out
Oh.
when we were down in B & Q 
Oh while we were there the other day.
wouldn't have had to spend those hours
Yes.
finding somebody.
Twenty two to, Hardpool Star garden compost .
That's thirty four ninety nine.
You see.
I mean, all these, these grass cuttings erm from what Chris is doing now could go in.
It's a shame just to waste it isn't it?
B & Q growing bags.
The only thing is, you can't find them.
Cos you're filling up the weeder bin and I want  well  anyway,we we've got to get sorted out compost for it.
There's some baby sweet corn left erm  oh I might get 
They, they won't be very good.
I'll put them in a chicken casserole tomorrow.
I can use all these peppers up as well.
With the sauce.
Oh I need some more tomatoes.
I guess Chrissy's coming in for something to eat.
Well I called him but  I didn't think there was a rush.
No there isn't.
Saturdays are going to take some, they always take some getting used to when the football season's first finishing.
I don't know  
The erm 
ah I've got loads of mushrooms left, put those in the casserole, that's what I've got left .
The B & Q conservatory, that one you were in the other day
Oh yes.
which comes in one size, twelve foot four by ten foot two.
Oh!
Want one bigger than that.
Three thousand six hundred and ninety nine.
Not bad.
Oh!
Erm  talking about conservatories  for which you need , I've read about the quiz.
Yes, it starts at, it says on the front it starts at seven, and then at the back  it says the actual quiz starts at seven thirty.
Seven thirty to eight fifteen, then there's an interval which you have pie and peas, which is always good at the town hall  erm, and then it's nine to nine thirty part two of the quiz.
So really it sounds the sort of thing that'll be nice for you and I to go really just to get away from the children.
Or do you want to go on your own so you don't have to get a sitter?
But I need to be knowing cos if we're going out I'll have to
That's right.
Yeah.
let the other  man, the conservatory man know, it's not fair to  not be here to .
Mm.
He's gonna be a pain in the neck!
I know love.
I mean  there's no intention of letting somebody like that have a go.
I was gonna do it myself.
Well if there's no intention I may as well cancel him altogether.
There's no point in wasting his time either.
Well we're not are we?
Well if we're not I'll ring him up and say  I'll say  er
Hey we're going out and be,we we're going to have them build us one, I mean  er  my intention is I might get  Stuart  or somebody to put the bricks at the bottom.
Yes.
Sort of a semi do-it-yourself.
But a it'll, I'll assemble it myself.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cos Johnny can come up and give us a hand can't he?
I could do the lot actually if it comes down to it.
Are you okay with what I've put out?
That ham and potato and salad.
Yeah!
More than enough thanks.
I'll warm some of these, well I won't warm all of them.
Right.
Davey!
Come on.
Do yo do you want some ham and some peppers?
If you get a jacket potato?
I'll do it mum.
Is it, is it old, old?
Yes, it's the same sort of thing, and then it warms them up.
No thanks.
No?
Oh!
 

Chrissy!
I'm not finished yet.
Lunchtime.
Stop it.
He's done very well hasn't he?
Stop the mower.
Oh I haven't shown you how to do that.
Chris!
Oh what the heck!
Well as long as he doesn't hurt himself.
It's alright Chris.
Dad's saying you haven't go you've done very well.
That's still going but er   
But it 
come back to all the grass now.
I can see, can you sha can you go and  get all the grass off your socks !
Ah ah!
He, says he's been in the wheelie bin and jumped on the grass Phil .
Who?
He says, he's filled the wheelie bin and it's go he's been in it and jumped on the top, so course  his track suit is  
Well it's not  it's not bad what you've done.
got covered in grass.
Pardon?
I didn't do that much.
I thought you had to push it?
Oh no.
. Erm  take your gloves and just shake them outside.
What's that?
No I'll, I'll ha have another go later.
I'll warm those up.
I think I'll warm all those up because we might eat 
Bye.
them all.
Ooh it's cold!
Well he's coming in.
David!
Come on!
I shall hoover you to get that grass off.
Thank you, cleaning these up.
Hands washed boyo.
I bet it's come again and I was dashing in to, I had about two minutes to  Sunday 
Hey!
night.
And I wa as it was I was in the bread queue.
Aargh!
And queue up soon and get in there.
Who complained?
Either way, that's too late for the kids.
Yes.
But the thing you won't like it, it'll probably be John there.
John?
.
Well he will be.
Well  aha 
and Simon and things.
Yes, well, if you go, if just you and I go we're likely to end up with somebody who knows us.
We have to make up a team though don't we?
I mean, we can't do it on our own?
But you, probably wouldn't want to be with John.
Well  yes but it  will  Ruth be going?
And how are we going to make a team?
I would doubt Ruth will be going.
But it sounds as if it's a sort of family evening though doesn't it?
I mean  shall we take somebody with us?
I mean, would Dave and Wendy want to go?
Mm mm.
I don't know.
I don't really know what it is.
But I'll read it again.
Hang on.
Read it again.
We ought to be making our minds up.
Cos if that, if you go on your own that's fine, but if I'm going we've got to get a sitter.
Well it says, entrants may take part as individuals or as teams of up to four persons.
Oh well, oh you and I can do a 
So we don't need
you and I can do a team on our own then.
Can I come as well?
I'd like to take you Chris but it is a school night, I think it's going to be,yo it'll be ten o'clock before we got home.
The quiz will contain some sixty questions covering general knowledge and not just railways.
So there is nothing for a family to be afraid of .
If it was er space then we need Chris because
Mm mm mm.
co we need Chris as our space expert.
And me!
As my 
Oh!
And you, aren't you being 
What are you an expert on?
What are you an expert on?
Railways.
Well that's true, yes.
Yes, you're not bad are you?
Yes.
They don't even know who built the first engine?
Who don't?
The people at the quiz.
Oh I'm sure
Oh I should think they will do.
The person who's .
Definitely.
Yes.
Like you go  number one,.
Number one, who's Richard ?
A person .
Where from?
Now, number two, he's a Cor 
England.
he's a Cornish man.
Very good.
Very good.
What was his inside leg measurements?
That's English.
It's English though isn't it?
Mm.
Who wants a tiny bit 
Yes, Chris.
of cheese?
But actually he built his first engine, I think, for a  quarry in
Pennydaryn Pennydaryn.
Wales.
That's right.
And where was that?
Yes.
Wales.
Chrissy's got it.
For a six year old you know a lot about engines.
The potato's ready in a moment kids.
Dad.
Mm.
If anyone wants a little bit of cheese I'll do it.
I know he, he broke the rails 
 
he broke in rails because some silly man was talking to him in Wales!
cholesterol level .
Actually I'll do a little bit more than that.
Well that's Richard  's fault.
No, no it wasn't he put on too many weights sunshine 
Oh no you can't have much cheese.
The engine was just too heavy.
Yes.
What happened?
Er er  what?
It it broke, it broke 
To, to, to the engine?
the track, it split the rails.
Did it?
Yeah.
Well yes be 
I don't know much about this sort of thing.
You don't want 
because the 
any cheese do you Phillip?
No thanks.
The plate, the plate ways, the railways they had then  were built for horses to pull trucks on.
Thank you.
And they di 
They fell off.
they didn't know a lot about steel, they were made out of iron.
Mm.
You can have a  
And when he built his first engine it was made out of erm  iron and stuff and was extremely heavy.
I haven't done enough peppers.
What am I thinking of there?
Is steel lighter than iron?
Well not necessarily Chris.
Erm
Is it stronger but 
It's, it's stronger weight for weight, you see, or  well it can be in certain circumstances.
Grab a chair there.
Steel tends to be a bit more elastic.
Oh.
Iron do iron, certainly the stuff they used then, cast iron, was very brittle and
Aha.
so it won't stand shocks.
Mm.
So if you put a big heavy engine going down a cast iron railway  which won't 
That might hit the railway,
which won't be made  properly
Ah.
it'll go  and crack it.
Mm.
But I mean, having said that, there's lots of cast iron bridges around still,lo the one at Stamford Bridge is er
Mm.
cast iron and I mean, it's no problem in that  situation.
And get a shock.
Ah ah!
The steam engine  coming through .
Mm mm.
And that railway that, little railway wi is made of cast iron.
In the middle.
 
I just said that.
The one at Stamford?
 

Near the old railway bridge.
Which one David?
The walk on one?
Which one?
Over there?
Oh!
This one here.
No, that'll be steel.
That was only cos you came 
Ham David?
Yes please.
in the, in the sixties Chris it wasn't erm so 
I didn't make any coleslaw, you like coleslaw don't you?
So it's a comparatively modern bridge.
I'll have some lettuce 
The 
though.
there used to be a level crossing there.
Mm mm.
Oh yeah.
Eastgate used to go right through down to join
Hey!
erm
That's right.
Anderson Street.
Ooh!
But you see that would have given, one, two, three, four crossings on that, within half a mile in Driffield, so they closed that one and put a footbridge over and erm  thanks.
I'll take that.
I'll take that one for you.
And three crossings in about five hundred metres.
Well, that's about right, yes.
So, you can imagine what it'll be like cos erm  twenty years ago in the summer, well no, twenty five years ago
That one.
Saturdays and Sundays there would be trains every ten minutes going to Brid.
Are you going to put butter on that yourself 
A 
darling?
Attlington.
Pardon?
You've got your mouth full.
Just wait.
That's not right.
So do, erm I'll get you some butter in a minute.
They go every half hour now don't they?
Hang on a minute, it's
I think so.
They don't take long.
Oh excuse me!
That's the damp grass.
Mm.
Dad.
Yeah.
Erm  no they le 
Dad I said er 
well er, I'm, excuse me David I'm talking to Chris.
Yeah, they're normally every half  hour, but
In the sixties 
when it used to be summer Saturdays and Sundays they were excursions, they weren't  service trains.
Some weekends like Eas erm, not Easter, bank holidays, August bank holiday and stuff, you'd have as many as they could get in.
You know I don't
I'm sorry, I was just, I was gonna pass that to daddy.
And did you know that when, when they used to go to Bridlington you know, you know where the big signal box is at Bridlington, near B & Q?
Yeah, yes 
Where the bus, and you know where the buses park and everything, that used to be all sidings  right under that bridge that's got the weight limit on
Yeah.
for storing the engines and the coaches  for the excursions 
And trucks.
and they used to get so many
And trucks.
And trucks Dave.
Well they didn't have trucks for excursions, they didn't take any sheep and cattle to the seaside for a day.
 
 
But
they erm
The donkeys were already there.
they used to, they used to travel them back to Driffield if they were full and keep the empty coaches  in two sidings.
It used to be down to Meadow Road.
And they used to keep them there until it was time for people to go out and then they'd run them back up to Brid.
So it was that crowded.
How did you know?
You know, you'd think things had changed a long time ago but erm  I remember having Chrissy in that yard when he was a baby in his pushchair  where  and there was the coalman's horse and erm
Oh at Brid?
cart at Bridlington.
You know, and guess what, I remember
I can remember that.
it was Edgar.
Mm.
You can remember?
That's very impressive!
Well he's probably seen the pictures as well but 
Seen the pictures, yes.
And he's seen the .
Yes but we had you there
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Hot!
Well it's not that hot if you put your hand at the side.
I thought you would have known not to put your hand over the .
Mum, can I have some bread and butter?
I didn't, I just 
Bread and butter.
gripped it with my hand.
Mum can I have some 
Sorry.
bread and butter?
It's stuck together.
I beg your pardon?
Please.
Do you want some of this?
Do you want that piece  or do you want me to cut you another?
That  other please cos I don't tend to bother with Yorkshire.
Don't be silly!
Mm.
Jolly nice bread.
Mm?
It's much easier cutting that.
Are you not going do all that?
Dad!
You're not going to eat all that?
He'll eat as much as we can.
growing lad .
Yes.
I'm a growing lad.
There's your  piece of bread.
Do you want it folded?
 
Or do you want it cut?
Sorry Chris?
Cut.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut.
Dad.
Cut.
What?
When is the next ?
Thanks dad.
When is that?
Next year isn't it  
Oh erm 
coming one.
there's one in
Eh?
there's one in April, and it might be Easter.
Erm  I've a feeling it's the eighteenth.
I there's
That's the Saturday, that's the Easter Saturday.
Yeah.
And  Easter, whether we're here or not, there's erm  I think there's that train coming through here  it is the  model railway exhibition in York.
That's the big one.
That's at the racecourse.
Oh yeah.
And there's a swot meet at New Earswick  on 
Mm.
erm  the 
Mm.
Saturday.
Is there any point in trying to go away for Easter now if there's so much going on?
Could you pass the mug and I'll pour Chrissy a cup of tea.
And of course the National Art Museum  Exhibition reopened.
Oh yes!
We said we'd do that.
Well I'll get the afternoon off then, if the kids are off.
Yes.
The children, oh sorry Chrissy I put you too much water in there.
Well we're not going on the opening day.
Well never mind, I'll pour you some .
Why not?
Set me straight.
I mean do we want to go and stay with the children at camp or shall we stay home?
Everybody in York will be wanting to go.
Maybe we'd better aim for the spring half term to go away.
Well do you want stay at caravan then?
Well, I don't know we went, it depends on the weather I mean, we went last year at 
Well I mean 
half term and the weather wasn't very good.
Yeah I mean lo yo I mean look at now, you could have gone away now.
Right.
Well it's just it gets dark a bi it still gets dark early and when we've got the children, I mean
They've got all their chess sets and things.
Mm.
Mm mm.
Yes but we tend to use it  like even the light's not working.
Mm.
I found in Northumberland, the worst bit was it was just going out in the cold to the shower.
I mean there's much better hot showers it was okay but  then it was, and the 
Yeah but I mean we 
building was cold.
we were just unlucky that was, that was raw.
Mm.
Well yes, what was wrong with it?
Erm 
Pardon?
oh yes, we never got to see the fields did we, cos the mist coming out?
Mm.
And whereas, if we'd been in the Lake District we'd have got a tan, so it just depends.
Mm.
Well okay, that was a time she'd been camping in the Lake District, Mrs  did.
What?
And see where her socks had been while she'd been climbing.
What?
Erm, where I staying this week, Chris, was only about  oh ten miles from Morpeth  and, you know, not far from  Annick and places like that.
Well we said, did you not visit and Morpeth and Annick  well we we went round a few castles in that area  to keep out the rain.
Ah!
Shall I tell you what I, shall I tell you what mountain I, she climbed.
Mm mm.
Mount Everest?
No.
Mm mm.
Not necessarily.
Go on David.
Is try and make up a mountain that's misty, so she looked at the map and began to climb down.
Who's her?
So 
Mrs .
She was going climbing 
Oh oh!

and looked
I thought he was telling us about a mountain he climbed.
No.
Can't you remember any of those castles up there then Chris that you went round?
What?
Where's that sheet?
They're on the dining room table.
Chris, David's moved them.
I can remember one castle  Rareapple.

And erm  I went past Beamish yesterday Dave.
Did you?
Oh we, we was going to go to that weren't we?

Yep.
We passed Newcastle.
And dropped in.
Well that's right.
That's where I was staying.

Yes.
The thing that reminded of that is the erm  you know how in the Leader they do day trips to places and it's

It was a beautiful pitch.
No, no, no, no.
And the walls were round it.
And, and, it, it, it  pitch.
Oh yes, like when you drop down onto that bit.

And then we walked further and then we found this pub to eat.
And it was  it was very nice.
Where the Indian restaurant was shut with the windows broken on.
Oh that was it.
Yes.
And it, but we, I liked that pub.
I mean, you had where you, it was a hotel, you had to watch where you can take the children into the  not that that's a place that we don't want to take you, there's places they don't want children.
We had a knickerbocker glory.
And places your mum doesn't want to take me either.

Mm!
Yes.
Pardon?

Didn't like having pigs.
Geese were alright weren't they?
Except it wasn't very nice watching them disappear just before Christmas.
Well at least they gave  some to some old concentration

Bit of a daft time to wait to, to .
What did he say?
Consummately easy win?
He did indeed.
Oh that's a good picture they've got there isn't it?
That's really constructive.

I bet they show other people all that.
Getting her head in the way of the camera.
So what happened to Senna?
I know he dropped out, but why?
Don't know.
Oh.
Ran out of steam after eighteen laps.
If we're going to do any more quizzes this is the sort of thing we're going to need to know to do well on the sports sections.
Well I don't know.
They don't do interesting sports.
They did the firs 
They do obscure ones like golf.
ah but the, the first ques the first question on the sports section was, what team does Nigel Mansell drive for?
Oh.
Did you get it right?
No, we could only come up with, I forgot, but it was something Renault, and we could only think of Renault.
Williams,Will Williams.

Your mum loves it.

Standing on the podium and they spray champagne over everybody.

That does annoy me!
Breaks your mum's heart that, to see all that champagne thrown.
No it's not the waste of champagne, I feel sorry for everybody getting so sticky.
Oh .
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!

About Senna retiring.
Oh, you saw the first
I want to see all the exciting bits I missed.
Well, won't they have highlights on later?
This is the highlights.
You mean, they didn't show the full race?
The full race was run at some obscure time today so 
When I listened to the six o'clock news
I was hoping you wouldn't come

No, oh  do I ever?
They said it was half way through
Yes, well that's a 
at the six o'clock news.

Then she says no.
Well I daren't ask Susan again.
Daren't.

We caught it.
Yes, it was really good.
And these  so you can catch eggs.

Yes, I think so too.
Because he only ever, he only threw one egg out of the audience and we caught it, whereas at a, every year he throws lots of Wagon Wheels out.
Oh oh.
  
Yeah, and it's both of them.

That's, I was, I was, I was listen I was listening to Neil Kinnock 
That was why he shouted at us to go away, he was listening to .
promising us this fantastic new world that isn't gonna cost us any money.

Quite so, I think if Kinnock 
 
But I 
if Kinnock gets in you've got an old woman so you'll be right.
I think that's fantastic!
That David, they thought 
But I thought it was 
that women could o only women could hold the top jobs.
No, I thought  if it was a man it was a president and it was a woman it was Prime Minister.
Oh yes,yo you're destroying my belief in what you were thinking about.

Just cos you're brain washed with television advertisements Chrissy.
I'm not.
Cos you keep going on about it.
Mm.
Mhm.
How about  ba er  how about  ambers how about  Andrex.
Has anybody heard the weather forecast today?
 
Yeah.
You, you were listening to it on the radio.
I heard you listening and I thought oh she'll probably wanna tell me if there's anything, it's that the warmer airstream or something.
Yeah, I, I can never, I can never take in the rain check .
Oh!
Unsettled that was it.
And then more showers.
Come on, Chris.
Get on.
Ian McCaskill's trying to tell us what the weather forecast'll 
You wouldn't 
be like for Thursday 
 
and I'm sort of thinking, why Thursday?
Then it suddenly dawned on me, why  Thursday.
Right.
Come on!
Move it!
Yeah but you did the weather all sunny  on the computer.
Yes, but I haven't been to work today.
I 
Mm.
e I read it yesterday and it was gonna be alright, it said fine.
There's only one sock here, where's your other dirty sock?
But that yesterday dad but I thought it was today.
Well I expect the whole thing needs washing doesn't it?
Pardon?
I thought it was today you want on the computer.
Yesterday we went.
I know.
She ee shh.
Go on Dave, get on.
Chris.
Splash  this  splash over the  splash over the bath.
There, a really big splash!
Mm, whoosh!
Well I'll do that.
I'm was having  on mine.
Alright?
Which one's yours?
Are you a Smartie one?
Yeah.
Well go and fetch it then.
Right.
There's a  a thing there.
Do you want any more drink?
No thank you, I, please let me just finish clearing and I'll, I'll get it finished off quickly.
You were telling that Judy, Julie.
Nothing.
She said she was just having just the usual drinking gear and er
Well I'm 
eat biscuits, and I don't, nothing else.
I haven't, I haven't any biscuits have I?
Well you'll have some Kit-Kats or summat won't you?
Nope.
Breakaway?
I think I've got Breakaways.
I want to put the  disposal unit on so can you  move this?
Come on sunshine, come and sit with me here.
Right.
I'm ready.
You're ready?
What are you going to do?
Well, first I need a  light of concentration
Oh light helps you concentrate does it?
Yes.
Go on then.
Have some light.
That's  sit down!
No next to me here.
Oh right.
I'm coming.
Just leave that here.
Right.
Right.
Now what are you going to show me?
I'll tell you.
Right.
One, plus, plus  one.
I'm taking some ones.
Oh I see.
That's how you set that up to do that is it?
Yeah.
Who showed you that?
Mrs .
Well I didn't know that.
But
She's getting a job at a different school now.
Cor!
Has she?
Getting a job.
But, you don't need a machine to do that.
You can count just like that.
And, and, well I'm just showing you them.
Right.
So
Here.
Yes.
Seven twos.
That's two, I got, got it, got it.
Right.
But you can count in twos.
Of course I can!
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.
After twelve?
Fourteen.
Then?
Sixteen.
Then?
Eighteen.
Then?
Twenty.
Then?
Twenty two.
Mm.
You're having to think about it.
Off then.
Clear.
So can you do ninety nines?
Keep adding ninety nines together?
Wait!
What's two ninety nines?
That's right.
Oh!
No now it gets useful doesn't it?
When you're dealing in bigger figures
All the
than you can do in your mind.
all the, all the numbers.
Mm.
Right, read me that number.
Two hundred and sixty nine.
Start again.
A hundred and two sixty nine.
How do you get that?
I number one is, what does it say at the end?
Nothing there.
Full stop.
It says, two, O, seven, nine.
Oh.
Two O seven nine.
Which is?
What does that make?
It's the number of a steam engine I've got.
I'm not bothered whether it's a number of a steam engine but  how do you pronounce that number?
Two hundred a 
No.
No.
two.
If it was that number it would be hundreds.
It's bigger than hundreds, so what's that?
Er thousands.
Right.
So how many thousands?
Two thousand and seventy nine.
Well you got there in the end didn't you?
Right.
Right.
Now it's even more difficult.
Even more difficult.
Equals
Yeah, very clever.
You can add up in, what are you doing up, in tens?
Tens.
You can do that.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, can't you?
Yes.
What comes next?
Fifty, sixty.
Then?
seventy, eighty, ninety, twenty
Ah ah!
Ninety?
A hundred.
That's better.
And add up in hundreds now.
A hundred, twenty
No.
A 
a hundred billi 
No, start off 
Erm 
with a hundred and then add another hundred what do you get?
I'm trying to work my way to the end.
Now you're being a pickle!
Not, not with the machine.
Using your own head.
Add, add hundreds up.
Come on.
What do you start with?
A hundred, a hundred and one, and 
No.
No, no, no, no!
I was, I wasn't meaning you to go up in single numbers I was meaning, go up in hundreds.
Start off with a hundred.
Yes.
A hundred.
Then add, add the same again.
Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred, ten hundred.
But what's ten hundred?
A thousand.
Right.
So why didn't you say that?
You didn't  yo 
I, I did.
I was expecting you to count, nobody says ten hundred.
Do they?
No!
It always goes onto the next number.
Every number ga always goes up to nine.
Then it triggers over into another one doesn't it?
Yes.
Now what were we saying the other day?
You have, units  tens, hundreds, thousands
But Dad 
don't you?
but   three er  there.
Check that number.
Ha!
That was stupid.
Yeah.
Mm mm.
So Mrs  was showing you how to do this?
Right.
Yes.
What, what else have you learnt to do with a calculator?
If you had four things
Yes.
If I give them
and you wanted to divide them among four people
Yes.
how many would each person get?
But I don I, I, I didn't quite get the question.
If you had four things and you wanted to divide them between four people
Yes.
how many would each person get?
Two.
No, one.
That's better.
Now you did that without a calculator didn't you?
Oh I see.
Right, now this time do it with the calculator.
So you've got
Four  turn it on.
Turn it on.
You run out of light?
There are.
Now you're on.
Which figure do you want?
No.
No.
You're dividing.
Which one's divide?
That one.
Divide by
Four.
Yes.
That's right.
Equals?
Right.
Now that wa that time, that's easy.
That just proves what you already know.
Right dad, I'll show you something else.
No.
I was going to do more  
But I wa I want to show you something, that's all.
Go on then.
Nine, fifty six  square root.
Er
Who taught you that?
Well, I lis no one.
It's Mrs  said to Mark 
Just a minute.
he, he, he was getting the  controls wrong.
He pressed square root instead of equals .
Yes.
And so you've discovered 
Eh!
the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine.
But do you know what square root means?
What?
Well the square root of a number
Yes.
is the number which if multiplied by itself
Yes.
gives you back the number you started with.
Take, for , the easiest one is  four.The square root of four is two.
Try it on your machine.
Right.
What do I press?
Four  four, square root  and it gives you two.
Because two times two  gives you four.
Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
Yeah, I just press this one.
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Cos it clears the whole mind.
Right.
What shall I press?
Nine  square root  is three.
So if you multiply three times three  you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
Yes.
the square root is four.
Yes.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self
Right.
gives you the number.
Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six.
Oh yes.
Try and find the square root of six.
What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be.
Don't, don't press the button.
Six.
Er er
What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?
Three.
No.
Three times three is?
I don six, six.
It's three.
No.
Three times three.
I don't know the answer!
Well look  three  three  and three.
So how many have you got?
Ten.
No!
Plonker !
You've got nine.
I'm just going 
Anyway 
to check.
So, there you are.
It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half.
Which isn't quite right.
Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time.
That gets very difficult.
Right.
Right.
So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
Right, I'll show you.
Ten  square root  is
Three point one six two two seven seven six.
Right.
Eh eh.
Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.
Very clever.
Useless for you though.
You don't really need that information do you?
Well dad!
So what, what, what sort of information do you need?
Tt.
Counting information.
Well, if you went out doing your favourite hobby.
Yes.
an engine.
Pardon?
Getting in an engine.
Driving an engine.
Now how would sums come into that?
What!
You can't get sums in an engine's smoke box.
Mm.
You could if they would burn.
Well you co 
I, I want to get clever with you.
Oh I thought you had been.
Shall we turn that off now then?
I'll get  
on  City News there's gonna be something about trams in Manchester somebody wants to see.
Well is it the new ones or is it, on the television, or on the radio?
Yeah, on, on the television.
Do you want to switch it on?
Do you want, no th are you interested David?
Yes .
Course I am, in anything like that.
Well I'm, I'm going up for my shower is that okay?
Okay, off you go.
I'll come up soon and  despatch David.
Sorry?
Oh!
What?
Is this the first part of the news or the second 
No.
bit?
It's the second half.
So there won't be much more?
No.
Oh no, I mean it's about another  another eight minutes.
Right.
I thought he'd want to see,take my shower.
Yes, off you go then.
See you later.
Right Dave, what do you want to do now while you're waiting?
Get really clever!
So how are you gonna get really clever?
I'm going to get two sheets of paper and two pencils .
I haven't got time for a lot of stuff.
Don don't be getting a lot out tonight cos you've got Julie coming.
They're not a lot anyway.
Only two of them each.
Okay.
Right what do you want?
Take one sheet.
I've got one sheet.
Take the green crayon then.
Right, I've got the green crayon.
Put it that way.
Hang on let me just  turn the television down.
You  you keep your eye on it so that when your tra tram programme comes on we can watch it.
Right.
What to do?
Well it's
that way you need it.
I want a table for this.
Well you can't use these tables.
Don't  let me just move this  magazine.
Write  five on it.
Have I got to write five on mine?
Yes.
Right.
My green pen doesn't write very well.
There you are.
Double add.
Double add?
I'm not used to double add.
Five plus plus  equals
Equals
Equals, equals?
Well this is a bit of a nonsense.
What's that?
One hundred plus plus
Equals, equals.
Equals, equals.
Now it gets easier.
Mhm.
Now it gets really even harder.
Well which way is it?
Does it get harder or easier?
Three hundred.
Mm.
Oh, three hundred and four.
I, I'm not understanding when you're doing plus plus when you're writing down yourself.
What are you trying to prove?
Divide
Mm.
Well that's, that's, that's very good for divide, but that's a square root sign.
A square root.
A square root at three hundred and four?
Yes.
Haven't a clue.
Equals
Equals  now what do you want me to do with all these?
Guess.
Oh I'm guessing.
Write your name at the top.
It's alright writing my name Dave but what am I doing?
Mm?
It's easier and easier.
Well it doesn't look easy.
Look, I'll do the usual.
Let me write you down some sums.
And you, you can answer them.
Okay.
Sorry.
I've put an answer in where you don't want.
There you are.
There's a nice list of sums for you.
Just get on with 
What 
those.
That's it.
Well it isn't easy.
It's the right one.
Bu yes, you got it right.
I, I shouldn't have written that.
You sho , five, six, seven, eight .
Good
.
Speak up.
How do you do a seven?
Er er, like that.
You know how to do a seven.
Oh here's the tram bit.
Let's fli turn up the sound  then we can    No you've done that backwards, it's seventeen not seventy one.
Here we go look.
Oh look Dave this is great!
Going  back to the old trams.
But how can they go through the towns?
Well trams Dave  they do both, they go on the railway lines and they go through the town centre.
Right.
Oh dear!
Don't watch this .
The Olympics, not that far away.
Right.
Let's see.
Seven minus two is
Good.
Ah ah!
That's wrong.
Right.
I'll just turn off the television then we can concentrate on
I can.
Da David!
You're not doing very well on that question and you've done harder ones.
Remember how you do it.
Add the four to the three
I have.
and what do you get?
Eighteen!
No you don't.
Well do it, do it the way on your fingers.
You've got thirteen plus four.
Thirteen  Got it now?
Yes.
Plonker!
Right.
Now let's do this one.
This is, this is easy.
Great!
Now yo there you are now then  now getting a little harder but you can do it in just the same way.
.
So what's the answer?
Yes!
You've got it right.
Now this last one  then we'll do something different.
That's right.
Thirty three minus two is  thirty one.
That's not bad.
Right what do you want to do now?
Mm?
Er er, I don't know.
Right.
Well we can do plenty of that.
Have you cleared up all your toys and everything before Julie comes?
There's that 
Well then  why is it still out?
And have you cleared up everything in the dining room?
Oh my er  trees are still out.
Chrissy hasn't put all the  climbing up things away.
Mm mm.
Well shall we go through and do some clearing up then?
Come on.
Go and put these pens away and the paper please.
We'll do some writing then.
Not tonight we won't.
There's not gonna be any more time.
Go put those away please.
Off you go.
Right.
Now you said you were gonna tell me what's happened on the news so far.
Three people have er been killed in a railway accident after their  their car  ran into the side of a train.
Oh dear!
Wh which is about er  which  is about er  open  er  the day after tomorrow.
What's open  the day after tomorrow?
The level crossing.
Oh it's closed now is it?
No, they're going to open it.
It's new.
Aha.
What else has been happening?
And dad?
Yes.
You know that many level crossings are one barrier?
Yes.
Well that  they showed us er  a thing about  the speed about  about the traffic approaching lights when they're  starting flashing.
It showed you a car go over that, going over,tha a lorry going over crossing and the lights were starting to flash.
Well a lot of people do that.
It's very dangerous.
But I was supposed to stop.
They ha as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop.
Be 
What the running of the railway line?
No, they're supposed to stop before the lights.
Silly!
Yeah.
Because, on a lot of those the train
Yes.
activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're o automatic.
That's right.
So 
They have er special cameras which  they take the line of the trains both sides.
Mhm.
And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers  the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you.
So it's a very silly thing to do.
Yes.
Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across.
Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.
But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come 
If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway  er th ah  there's only way you can escape.
Go round by the barrier pole.
Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield.
Yes.
The barriers 
Er 
.
they've got full barriers you see.
Full barriers.
Double are safe.
Well, they're different because they have them  they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're 
Yes they are controlled.
controlled by a television.
Er 
If they're controlled  well dad, everyone knows that one th the Tackleby's controlled by a man.
Oh yes.
That was good wasn't it?
Yes.
Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't you?
Oh yes.
But  though it was rather dangerous.
After all in my, you know my er  people working on the rails book?
The one 
Yes.
.
It says, you must never try to steer ru steer round a bu barrier poles.
That's right.
And they're trying to take away as many er  possible erm, mainly one barrier er  railway gates as possible.
Well I didn't know they were trying to get rid of those.
Especially on busy main roads.
But some of the crossings around this area didn't have any barriers at all 
Ah ah.
and  they just had the flashing lights.
Well it's like wo ones at Meading Ro Meadow Road.
That's right.
They're only wooden ones.
Ah well tha no Meadow Road's got the old gates but  at Natherton there were some that didn't have any  barriers at all, they were just flashing lights.
Now, do you remember  now let's think whether you were born.
When the Lockington railway disaster happened  that was just a few miles from here.
At Manchester?
No, Lockington.
Ah.
And that was where er, a train came off the railways when it hit a van  on 
Oh.
on the crossing er and killed a lot of people.
Oh.
I, I, I know, I'd, I have never heard  never heard.
Oh!
That's sa surprise cos I was on the way to Hull  oh yes!
You were around because I was going to take you and Chrissy to Hull to a train fair
Ah yes!
And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train
Yeah.
and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.
And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash.
Yes.
Thank goodness we didn't.
Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
Well it's a good job mum came.
Mm mm.
I hope, I hope .
Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.
It happened just after we went past the, just before.
You could see  er  a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards 
I 
the crossing.
And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and 
Mm mm.
so did you, could you hear the sirens?
No I couldn't.
But erm  when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened  and we went to the toy fair and then we came back  and there was er  you could see all the ambulances and everything still there.
And the train was there leaning over.
But half of it was still on the rails.
Yes it was the front coaches went off.
Front coaches?
Onto the side I think.
Well what sort of express?
It was erm  well what do you think it would be?
Er  I think it must have been a multiple unit.
That's right.
It was a diesel multiple unit.
And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
Yes.
Thank goodness for that!
I wouldn't want one of those, one of the pacers or sprinters or metros spoilt.
But dad!
They're all multiple units  at sometimes.
Yes, of course they are, but we, I was talking about the old sort of diesel multiple unit.
Yes.
One with the yellow front.
You can get all different sorts of, one with two red lights erm  one with two windows   
Can you?
Yes.
Mm.
I'm pleased you know your trains.
Yeah.
Right.
Well I'm gonna have to start thinking about getting ready.
What about you getting ready for bed now?
Dad.
Mhm?
What about the Manchester  crossing disaster?
Which one was that?
Er, just outside Manchester.
Mm mm.
Can't remember that one.
The one about those two boys playing on the track.
Oh!
Is that one they've told you about at school?
No.
No.
I got it from the telly.
Oh!
Did you now?
No.
You, you told me about it when you came home once.
You told me about that disaster.
Well, your memory's better than mine.
I can't remember it now.
The only tha disaster I know very well is the Tay one  the Tay  Tay Bridge.
The Tay Bridge.
Yes.
And half of it still is standing.
What else do you know?
Er er  tt oh  what about?
The Tay Bridge.
Er er  well the engine which should have pulled, the post train, broke down  so that went to the works  and the engine which took its replacement
Mhm.
was one which  they  which fell down with a crash.
Oh!
Mm mm.
Dad!
You should know all this, you told me.
Well you've got your book on it haven't you?
Somewhere.
Of course!But I can't read it.
Right.
Anyway, come on let's 
But dad, I don't understand.
Well what don't you understand?
About all this at Tay Bridge.
About other things in my book.
Mm mm.
Anyway, come on, let's go get ready.
They really should give  give you a magazine article itself about the Tay Bridge.
Well you've got a magazine that's got a lot of it in.
But not very much.
No.
Here's Julie here now Phil !
I've left the tape running  running.
Sorry cat.
Oh.
Come on.
Hi Julie!
Hi Julie.
Mummy.
He's not ready.
He's got a nerve asking you to, well letting you do this.
Sorry?
I, he's got a nerve 
Mum!
letting you do this!
It's taking 
Mummy!
advantage!
Sit down.
I wonder if I  
You don't mind?
I'll take you through in a minute, I'm just cleaning my shoes.
Alright.
I'll take them off.
No don't take them off, it's ju d'ya know I had those re-heeled about two weeks ago.
Did you?
Look!
It's, well 
Isn't that awful!
Well yeah.
Bit depressing 
 
though cos well it's two, two pounds fifty six.
I've just taken another pair today to be re-heeled.
I mean, all I've done is walk up to the school a couple of times in them.
Can hear the sheep.
Yes.
They're noisy tonight.
Oh you brought all your work with you?
Erm  there's all the stuff there.
There's only biscuits, I haven't been able to do any baking.
I don't want, I don't eat them.
I don't eat   any more .
Well especially if it's my baking!
Mm.
Now David will be down in a minute.
David, can you tuck your pyjamas in please?
Yep.
Do you know how to work the fire?
, if I can work it anybody can.
Erm, Chris is out at Cubs but he gets brought home.
Right.
So he'll arrive about  twenty to, quarter to eight, and he just gets dropped off.
Well, the person who's dropping him off might just check that there actually is somebody in the house, you know, so  do you know how to work the television?
No.
Well okay, I'll come and help you.
It's on standby and then er
there's the controller
Er er
it needs new batteries 
never mind.
er to ge to get 
Hi love.
if not, erm, just press these buttons here.
Oh right.
There's the Radio Times there 
Erm 
there.
so a one-legged person going out of here.
I'm trying to put my shoes on.
Right.
Erm  David
David.
He's out there eating again.
Having his yoghurt.
His toothbrush is up, Judy  he's
Julie, not Judy!
I said Julie didn't I?
Oh yes alright.
He's erm, he's self-sufficient, as Chrissy walks in David can go up to bed, he's, can do his own teeth, get himself in and, you know, and
He's been .
if you let him though he'll, he'll stay up all night and read to you and things like that, but no, just send him to bed.
I don't mind if he reads for a few minutes but that's it.
Chrissy will come in, he might  come in bringing Simon  and his mum
He won't!
You know Fran   bri 
Yeah.
brings him home?
And  the last two weeks they've come traipsing in to swap 
They won't tonight.
They won't.
to swap Megadrives.
They won't.
Anyway
In other words Julie, there is nothing for you to do is all, I mean, you're giving, you're giving millions of instructions 
No, but if Fran walks in, if Fran walks in they'll just put, they'll put a toy on and they'll take it out 
Well Chris'll sort all that out.
You can just ignore everything.
you can tell them to clear off.
You can 
Erm 
have a go on my exercise bike if you want.
That's if nobody  else does .
Erm
Don't you like it?
Well tha it requires effort.
Er er  yeah, and Chrissy goes to bed at eight.
He can only read till half past.
But he knows, he knows that.
I know, but 
There's nothing for you to know 
he'll  Julie around

Suit you.

Oh !
See Mr  last night.

Oh that's nice.
Yeah.
I don't think the prospect cheers Jane up particularly but  What are you doing?
I don't know that I've even seen that .
He gets frustrated when he can't win though.
Yeah but don't we all.
I mean, that isn't just a function of their age 
Yeah.
it's a function of age you er
I know, but it gets him depressed.
I know, but er, Jane goes through the same, I can't remember things.
Oh!
I should be able to do this and that but, but it happens.
It's just as you get older I think you, you begin to notice it more because your conscious of  your faculties not being there.
Anyway, erm  but, but with John he wo he will, he'll get really uptight, he won't erm
I don't even think it .
Alright?
Anything else?
Are you taking your car?
Cos if you are I'll have to move mine.
We'll take whichever one we can get out quick Julie.
Erm, Jane's'll be  easy.
Mind you, I've erm  far enough forward to be able to get
Oh!
We'll manage.
Will you?
I'll see.
Yeah.
I can see the drive .
You seen what they've been doing?
Putting the new  
Yeah.

Are you turning the tape off?
Ooh!
Anything more to do?
No.
I don't think so.
I'm tired.
Are you going to  finish off in the kid's room?
Yeah, I'll switch this thing off.
I'll watch the rest of Newsnight in bed I think.
Right.
Oh!
What's this branch for, did you work out?
Well it looks like it's a  handy  for one or something.
Oh!
It is isn't it?
That's why it's got to be  with the making the bird table I suppose.
It's obviously .
It'll be about  I think about half past one.
But I can find out for definite  later on.
I've got grandma's .
What about another one?
It's the only one there is .
What's this?
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Oh I didn't want to come back.
No.
I didn't want to come back.
Oh oh you shouldn't have done .
You've got joinery and 
I, I haven't.
I was told I had to.
Oh!
I was  
 
had a chance to get my job finished.
You don't take any notice of them do you?
 
Yes, well I thought so .
She looks absolutely.
Oh!
 
Dear.
It's lovely isn't it?
Mm.
Had it trimmed, do you feel better?
She's taken quite a lot off actually.
And that  it didn't feel it when she was sort of combing it, but now I'm actually doing that I can feel it short.
It's not there.
Mind you, it needed it.
It did need it.
She said it did.
Oh I need a cut.
So   yeah .
So, I'm thinking oh it's hard, when I actually feel it it feels thicker at the end and it does feel better but  when I've washed it, I shall feel all hairy now all afternoon.
Yes.
I'm just going to look .
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a really nice trim.
This is it.
Mm.
Oh yeah, it's lovely .
I can't bear the tables and chairs at this  bottles of wine.
Bottles of wine or  nice cold lager.
Yeah.
Alright.
Yeah.
I almost envy the unemployed when they're sort of walking along the side the canal and 
Playing with their grandchildren.
That was.
Is it her grandson?
Aha.
That is.
We had loads of people in  last week.
In two and a half days we've had four  men  under
Int it terrible!
Innit sad, isn't it really?
I don't feel sorry for that man who came in on drugs and dropped  
Oh no!
I didn't tell Julie about that.
and when they were making, making a sign on the door
He had a cigarette in his hand and flicking ash up the carpet and I  was looking at him, you know, and I was sort of going,and Jane was sat in here and she said, put that cigarette out!
Cheeky !
He usually smell, erm the air  
And now cigar smoke I quite like.
But I, the other day I wondered who it was and it must have been him cos he was in Alan's office.
But er  cigarette smoke, I mean you wouldn't think of pu I don't whether it was a strong make or something like that but it was, it seemed really offensive didn't 
I know.
it?
Mm mm.
He said he was desperate for work.
Yeah.
For work.
And then he had a real flash car didn't he?
Desperate to get work, he's got a flash car and smoking  as well 
And smoking  
well I mean that's costly isn't it?
This is it.
But what er, I said, told Pete because I had another call when you  were at lunch I think  and erm  he said he'd heard rumours that we were looking for somebody.
Mm mm.
Now whether he'd just said that, or  whether he actually had.
Vanessa wants you.
Well no she doesn't, I've just been talking to her.
Well yeah, Vanessa  
And also Gill wants you.
Oh!
Popular.
Right, popular, yeah.
Are you do Alan are you doing 
 
Hang on a minute!
Hang on a minute!
Are you going to do erm  a valuation again?
I've already done it.
In your opinion 
And ask 
which one?
ask Mr .
I'm sure he'll be  only too pleased to oblige you.
Okay.
Is that the only one?
Yeah.
Yes!
I'll just move these out 
I thought you'd want 
the way.
I thought you'd want to sit round the table.
No, it's too low.
I thought we'd sit on that bench and
I must ring Gwyneth.
Mm.
Ring her up, see if she wants to come down for a drink.
Do come for tea.
Should I?
Yeah.
If she's in.
I don't know about her mother.
Erm, I wondered if I should ask her if she's going to the chinese tomorrow if she wants to drop in  on the way home.
A chinese tomorrow?
Yes.
And we'll drop in on the way home to watch a few election results or do you think if I start having a party tomorrow night it's gonna get out of hand?
Well, the only trouble is, she won't be voting the way you are.
I know.
We 
Actually, if she comes and stays I'm gonna have trouble because of, I'll have to get the boys' tea.
Well, so?
She can come round for quarter an hour if she wants.
What time is it?
About quarter to six.
Maybe a bit later.
Quarter to six.
Trouble is, if there isn't anybody in it's bad news isn't it?
It means, if she's away two nights
There's a nail sticking out of here.
Yes I noticed that.
It wants  I keep meaning to hammer it in.
I'll get a hammer.
Oh.
Oh dear.
Mind you, it's end of term, she's got all the activities going on.
Ah hello David, it's Jane.

And so, where, is Gwyneth back at work or  yes.

He won't be used to looking after himself.

You know, when she came to visit me when I was  in bed a couple of weeks ago she was asking   erm  how grateful she was to your parents  for

That's always a sign of .
Oh she didn't say anything.
She'll, she'll have the  of going up to the  to see her father.
Or end up living
No.
I think, she's got brothers over there.
Yeah, but look at them

Yeah.
It's a good memory of your dad.
Mm mm.
Oh dear.
That's sad.
Apart from that, how d'ya get on with Julie?
Oh fine.
Yes, I stopped off at the
She won't mind.
She'll get used to it.
She welcomes a buffer against Janet I think.
I'm really enjoying this.
If only we hadn't cut down those trees  the view would be better.
Yeah, oh this is nice being here in the spring with lambs in season.
Oh it just makes it that much .
Pat  's da dog, Ben.
Yeah.
Er well, sort of.
He kept chasing me round David  's garden.
Oh I'm not very pleased to hear that.
Thought I did something.

Oh, hang on David I think we ought to have that jumper off you.
Remember?
Look at the, look at the heat of him!
And earlier I had dog's neck.

Erm, can I do it or
Yes, clear that one off.
There's a new one, but  erm  Jane, do you want to have cut of bread?
Well I wasn't going to have any bread if we're having potatoes as well.
I would, but I  you know, I'm trying to give butter up.
When it comes to bread I can't
Resist.
What do you want, this?
Can I just have some of the new wine please?
Cos I
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
just wasn't sure.
I didn't think the old stuff was that bad.

Perhaps I'm more into vinegar than you are.
Dad, I've got my new stuff tomorrow.
Oh yes, sunshine.
Oh yes, I'll, I'll, I've been thinking

The general election is taking over the school.
Ah!
So you can't have any dinners at school?
Yes.
No, no, I mean
Down in the hole.

But where are the new potatoes?
Have you got the new potatoes?
They're here my girl.
Mum  whe I've been to some before and they've had the erm 
Well, shall I put them in the fridge?
school dinners in different places.
Sorry?
They've had the school dinners in different places before.
Yes, but probably the school actually is bigger than this, there's more people there than when you were in there and erm, that's probably just too complicated.
Mm.
Yeah.
I'm sure David won't mind sandwiches for a day.
It's quite exciting.
It won't be that good.
They'll just go down 
That's enough then.
first every day.
Pardon?
Pardon?
They'll just go down first every day.
Yeah, well it doesn't matter Chris.
Okay Chris, you can try the new one love if you've done that.
Let's get this in the bin.
And that.
Just erm, now, do you need anything?
No we got so many of them that erm, I'll, I'll
You don't want that one?
No.
You can throw that.
As long as you're okay on that.
Can I sit down now?
Only if I can have a lump of your bread.
In fact, maybe you should offer me the plate.
Can you pass me the butter?
Thank you.
I must admit I'm very hungry.
Well so you should be.
Working at the garden.
Like you've had a gardener in.
Can I have it please?
Thank you.
Don't worry David, I'll pick it up.
I didn't have a chance to put these out on a dish either.
Oh .
You mean, I haven't put it out on a dish?
Okay?
Chrissy?
Mm?
Want some turkey?
Do you want some turkey?
No thanks.
Did you David?
I've got hazelnut and ham haven't I?
Mm mm.
, one of those.
And some of that.
I didn't wash all  this so there's
Well I must admit
there's more if you need it.
it tastes better if it's washed and put in that, in that cling film.
Mhm.
It keeps better than  it's left in the bottom of the fridge.
Has David got some coleslaw?
You will eat your coleslaw honey won't you?
Mhm.
He's got some but he's not very enthusiastic.
I thought you said you liked it?
I go off and on it, but
Oh.
sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't.
Right.
Ow!
But it, it doesn't keep forever.
When did I make it?
Saturday.
So it wants using.
I'm doing my best, you know ma 
Well, I've made some more since then.
you know me  and coleslaw.
Oh, so I don't have to rush it?
Well, not that.
I'd prefer it to go.
Have you got everything you want kiddies?
Yeah.
Yes.
And a bag of crisps, got the same packet.
Boys, when we next see Gywneth will you be nice and quiet and kind to her, her Mummy's just died?
Ah ah!
Isn't that sad?
Mm.
What of?
Erm  well she's an elderly lady.
Erm
Heart problem wasn't it?
heart problems, that's what I said.
Mm.
So she's always very nice to you, so make sure you're very nice to her.
She hasn't got children to take her mind  off her problems .
Ah, if she had children, it's a pity she doesn't.
Be nice to be able to play with them.
There are the, other ways of looking at it Chris.
Not that I'd wish to encourage you, but if she had children she wouldn't be so generous to you.
Mm mm.
No.
Cos she's very generous.
Very.
She spends more on you on your birthdays than your grandparents do.
So think about that.
Doesn't she?
Indeed she does.
It's still a, it's still a present for her grandma.
Ow!
Shouldn't have mentioned grandma!
Only one of them.
We, we must go there at some stage  to see her.
Yeah.
She's in Japan at the moment.
We're hoping she'll stay there.
We'll, well .
Ha!
Come the end, end of the summer you haven't got a clue.
I wonder why?
Mm mm.
That was quite nice.
Has Bill got one?
Mm mm!
They've all two  except me.
Can we decide what we are doing this weekend because erm
You tell me.
Well what's the options?
We either stay home or we  stay home or we're going away.
If we go away I think it's too early in the year to use the caravan, therefore it means staying at 
Tent.
somebody's.
A tent !
Mm mm!
Or there's the tent.
Is that what you want Chris?
You can, oh you can have, the tent up on the back lawn if you, if you're so bothered about camping.
I don't think I want to go in tent this time of year.
Ring up Ted and Linda and see while they're going over to your mother's we'll go over to Aberystwyth.
Yes.
Well they have 
 
got
We'll bo borrow their house.
I used to like, camping's o okay Christopher, but it's difficult when you've got children.
Oh.
And when the nights  are that much darker early.
When it was just your Dad and I we, we could go out all evening and then, then come back to the tent, but when we've got you two we have to be back in the , we can't go out in the evenings.
Where's the wine?
On top of the microwave.
That's where you might expect to find cold wine.
More?
Mm mm.
Oh only a bit cos I    I've gotta cut David's hair tonight .
I'll cut your ears off.
Squiggly hair.
Mouth closed please Dave.
So, if we went away it's, it's really only Aberystwyth or  or  isn't it?
Mm mm.
I, I'd prefer .
Well  cos I think Phil and Lesley are going to grandma's  for Easter  and  they live in , and therefore it depe it depends what Aunty Dulcy's doing.
I mean, we could ring her up and ask her.
Or shall we just stay at home and go out for days and
Go to my parties.
Yes, you'd miss the parties if we went away.
But I need to know cos I'll do a turkey  if we're staying home.
Why?
Well
Well there's York model railway exhibition that weekend but we could still see that and go away.
I've got a Christmas pudding as well, left over from Christmas.
Mind you, if it costs three pounds a head to get in you'll probably not want to go.
I'll sit outside.
Ha!
Children free probably.
One pound 
What about stu 
fifty.
what about student concessions?
Do they have student  no?
Don't 
I 
know.
I would have thought so.
I mean, they usually do these things, if you flash your student card.
Pensioners and children, one pound fifty.
Here you are.
They do students as well.
Unless they  at school.
I keep forgetting to, well you can , forgetting to use my student card.
I'm not student.
Well you are really aren't you?
But, when they mean student they mean people who are over eighteen or nineteen.
Mum.
Mm?
And Dad.
Well Dad, Dad's a bi Dad's a student.
I'm nearer a pensioner.
Yeah, just a .
Dad.
Yes love?

I said to Julie  the office was quiet.
She said that was a nice day  they've all gone out .
Yeah.

Well can't we let David come round here when he's ready?
