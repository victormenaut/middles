Yeah, okay then, alright, I will do it, I will do it, yep.
If it makes you feel  
You're going through madness you know, I don't know what you're, what you're doing to yourself.
I'm not going out if I see her again.
Will I?
Everyone would be looking at me.
They'd run my life.
Yeah.
I know 
 

  

Is she going?
I don't know.
She might have and when I see her I'm gonna tell her 
Who?
Fiona, about my   
You're saying your sister's a lesbian?
Don't know yet  
her mum's at the day centre, a day, you know  she was gonna face her.
She's got a stroke in her and her mum can't talk or walk.
Granddad who
lesbian there.
Granddad, who was looking after her, died.
I can't, I just  I, where, sort of god almighty, this man, right, he was a good eighty-nine, right.
Good twenty years older than my Grandmother, right.
When I say he looked my Grandmother's age group and he  he looked bulimia even though he'd not done it.
her father a hundred thousand, wait until she's twenty-one though.
When she's twenty-one that's when she can get her money  because he died and left all the money to her, right.
Cos he use to be er, you know like in them black films when  famous tap dancers
Oh yeah.
he used to be one of them in America.
When he found out his daughter had a stroke he had to come from America and look after her  and like  then, from then on, he was just like, had that money in the bank, really.
He'd buy a house for Penny's mum, a big, big house  and then they'd sell it again  and he left every bit of the money to Dionne, so she'll be able to look after the child when she gets twenty-one and that, but now
Has she got a child?
 
Are you sure she's not working?
I don't think so  she's erm slow, she's, she's like erm, she has to go to a special school

Words?
We get told that, we used to get told like, use six thousand or seven thousand or numbers like that.
It took ages.
So everyone's gonna count their words?
Yeah, it was a certain amount of pages.
No, but they say pages not words.
Is it?
They say words  at my school.
What, is it Romeo and Juliet or something?
I have to get, I have to get people's conversations.
Oh that thing.
You signed to do it?
Yeah.
You will be careful with that, won't you?
Yeah!
Cos it costs a lot of money.
Especially the ones 
Have you used one?
with microphones.
It's not wa with a microphone it's just that I've got a little socket for a microphone.
It's not really expensive it's not that.
Yes it is expensive.
It's more than a hundred pounds I bet.
Hundred pounds!
Ridiculous!
It's got play, rewind, record, pause, but 
Yeah the ones with rewind buttons got the more expensive.
Still not gonna cost a hundred pounds.
Alright then, maybe not that much but quite a lot.
Yeah.
Over forty pounds I bet.
Yeah about maybe forty five.

No I haven't.
What, where can I hear it?
Cos I, I can't hear it on any of the stations.
You could  when they play it probably, Robert.
They play it, you notice if they're in the charts, you could listen to when they play 
Where?
Where?
When?

When they on?
Well, probably, I think Saturday or Sunday they play the charts.
Don't you ever listen to the radio, you know?
And don't slouch, put your shoulders back, boy!
And put your stomach in.
How can I walk like this?
You have to walk like that, but put your shoulders back.
You slouch like that.
Put your shoulders back.
Unusual innit.
It's very expensive that's why it's unusual.
Sixty nine ninety nine.

What's it doing take it off.
Oh yeah.

Mm.

Well why do you need it, why do you need a towel?
Why do you need a towel.
Why er why 
game.
Mum and Dad's got it.
Come on Mum.
Go get in the blooming bath.
Why?
I'll rewi rewind that actually heard what you say, you must be very naughty and nasty  thing to be to your son.
I can't have a sweet then.
Well you're not give me a sweet an all.
Should give me a sweet you know.
You should.
You're gonna turn it off because I wanna tear you off a strip about something.
Me?
Yeah.
Why?
What are we talking about?
Mum what's Hamlet about?
Pardon?
What's Hamlet about?
Hamlet?
Yes.
I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream.
to er see Rome and Juliet.
Mm.
And I think I need to make it up.
When is 
I dunno.
Well you better find out then.
What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got 
Well no if you can go.
You give me the money for it?
If it's within reason as I assume it will be.
Five Pounds.
That's okay.
W would it make much difference for you lending me the money.
Not a lot.
Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there  and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about.
Well
Yeah.
I thought a computer 
No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are  tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things  unless it's absolutely necessary.
Well 
And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can.
 
That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging.
I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet.
Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams.
All right.
Did you watch that animated version that you recorded.
Yeah.
Does it give you the gist of the story?
It,half an hour long.
Well I think it's longer than half an hour.
They probably should
an hour at the most.
Given you er  erm
The film is about hour and five minutes.
You can probably have a video of it as long  of another version.
Well it's does help to see different  versions because  you see that different people interpret the  
Why do you 
Mm?
Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got  different ways of doing it.
When I was studying  I went to  Open Air Theatre  and  I saw  a version there  on Christopher  er what's his name  that chubby fellow with the glasses  Christopher Biggins that's it.
He was playing Puck  and when I went to see the  Company  doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er  a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream.
They did it in a completely  slapstick farce way  you know th the men who were dressed up  women they  balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite  different.
How they 
Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of  of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would  would have a different way of doing it.
Okay.
There's a comedienne  erm  she apparently was born in Wales.
Mhm.
Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her.
Two Ton Tessie?
She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from  quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had  might well have had a Welsh  nurse.
So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy.
Mm.
She did it as she would have  thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that.
Mm.
And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet  
 
And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress.
Now I don't what Italy and those  Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn.
Mhm.
But  the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress.
Yeah, I mean  now plays  of  Shakespeare and  they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing  well either First or Second World War  uniforms.
Yes.
It was very different then.
Yeah, well it's just different  directors have different  things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or  they think that using a certain  well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will  will have more of an impact, you know will 
One thing I was wondering about you know they  they talk about erm  in  Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the  the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used.
Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature 
Yes.
Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it.
Does that help with it?
I suppose 
Pardon?
Well you should do.
And what about  I bought some  revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature 
 
Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing  Romeo and Juliet.
So if you look in those you may find there's some help there.
Yeah.
