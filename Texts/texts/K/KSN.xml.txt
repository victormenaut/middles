Doesn't work.
that I've got, well, it works on my computer, it works someone else's computer, but on one 
Doesn't work on mine, doesn't copy 
Exactly, on some people's computers, it don't work and I don't understand that.
 
And that, you try that  computer  it doesn't work.
 

When you get this,why didn't you get a four hundred.
I don't 
Mm.
Can you get it from a 
Why not.
Why not.
Yeah, from the shop, if you get any hassle  I don't mind  paying a bit more  pound more.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
a hundred pound more, you could say and then you get less hassle 
Yeah, that's true.
Or  even even, if they show you a receipt, you don't know if it's stolen or not.
Mm.
like that.
I  get it from 
Mm.
but,I save it to you, er, just in case 
Na.
I can get  is that, I have to borrow about, be about fifty pound, summat like 
Do you think  erm, Japanese convertor  pardon me,better than anything.
No.
You don't reckon it's the best, you get best 
You are at the moment, the best thing you get is to be in the top hundred.
Yeah, but, I don't 
At the moment.
Yeah.
But I don't, I don't  but at the moment there so, the games they've sold, there's no games  before, before there is gonna be really good games for the twelve hundred, yeah, before they start coming out.
Stuff like Mega C D and all that's, gonna come out, which is good, probably gonna be better than the twelve hundred.
Yeah.
That's why I'm not sure if I'd buy the twelve hundred.
What  apart from the C D  
The twelve hundred's good  The twelve hundred's good, yeah, but until the game, the good games start coming out, until they programme it.
They're making them already now.
Ah, they're making them, but at the moment,
have yer, when.
When I get  four weeks ago.
Oh, I see.
Why did 
Why?
My friend 
Oh A G  oh,
To do with a transport problem 
what got the original.
No, not the original, copied.
'cos I hate it when they just make 
stupid, it's a good computer, like, the stuff that's in this is very expensive but  start coming out, stuff like, you know, Mega C D's probably,
Yeah.
Mega C D and all that's gonna be 
That's quite  Mega C Ds crap.
Oh, Mega C Ds good.
Rubbish.
Mega C D is not 
It's crap.
C Ds 
Yeah, it'll turn off C Ds
Yeah, but that hasn't come out yet, but   
No, but.
for ages.
Is that 
It has.
It has.
It has.
It has.
Showed it in a magazine.
Showed a picture of it in a magazine.
What  compact.
I don't what it was.
They've made it, anyway.
And and, whathisname's gonna buy it.
He says he's gonna buy it.


And 
get released in England at all for years, next year.
How do you now?
you just have to get input.
You can get, you can get  well before you letters out 
 
You were able to get  super 
Yeah.
Similar line, innit.
You can get, you can get a C D.  
getting a Japanese convertor.
Yeah, you might just, you can get a Mega C D.
Just get the  
 
You can get  
What about  
Yeah.
Yeah, but he's got cousins, like,you've got,
Yeah.
cousins in Japan so he sends them games but, you can  them if you want.
Right, like I said, I'd be a bit cautious of getting a twelve hundred.
Why?
I don't know, I mean,loa , new computers come out all the time.
Nothing to beat the twelve hundred.
Shh, yeah.
Yeah, that  that's what I'm saying.
Nothing for a long time  like the five hundred.
Yeah, like the five hundred 
Even though there was better technology, still 
Yeah, look how stupid  were.
He  five hundred which was a good  
And then it went five hundred plus.
Exact five hundred plus.
 
Have you looked it.
Even the five hundred 
There almost the same.
Even the five hundred plus is  the same as the five hundred.
Yeah, I know, I know it is.
difference is.
Then they go to the stupid six hundred which is the same as that.
Exactly, exactly, so what you're gonna, you're gonna keep waiting until, it's, it's gonna keep coming out, so you'll have to buy twelve hundred.
So you'll  twenty-two hundred for  
Yeah.
In the, in the be between the twelve hundred and the four thousand.
Yeah, four megabyte  four megabyte.
Get that.
Yeah, that's 
How much difference is that gonna be?
What's the difference gonna be?
Yeah, but I think you gotta make  specifically.
Well, it's gonna be faster .
So, you can make it faster, you don't really need it faster.
Are they gonna make it specifically  
 
About thirty megabytes, 'cos it's twic it's be, it's processing being doubled compared to a th a normal 
Yeah, I  that.
So it's gonna be about thirty megahertz.
I worked out about thirty-three  
It's good  
Yeah.
But what I'm saying is, be a bit careful.
where to find one.
What you gonna d right if they bring out a twelve hundred plus, so what.


Twelve hundred plus.
That's gonna be, hardly any difference.
Yes.
The only thing I might not, it 'cause they said they might make one with a C D R O M drive.
Yeah, they're making  
Built in.
Might make it with a better 
C Ds.
No, I hope they might make a new  
Yeah, but C D T V Two, is only, it's only 
C D  but 
It's just a console.
It's a c you've seen a pic , you seen a picture of that?
Yeah, I've heard that  making a console.
It's old.
Yeah.
The picture.
Two hundred pounds under, under two hundred pounds, it's gonna be.
It's erm,
It's a console, it's not 
A megabyte.
Yeah.
Does it have a keyboard.
You sure.
No, it's a console.
Console, C D.
You probably could get a keyboard, but 
Er  actually, if I had the money, I'd keep my five hundred, but I think that's what  
How long is  two weeks.
For the shop?
Erm, this week and another two.
End of this week and two more.
You're gonna buy it 
You're definitely buying it, yeah.
We're getting a  
What day are you going, Saturday.
You can't go another day.
Oi er, oh, everybody I know  
No, because if you buy a twelve hundred, what you gonna carry it  everywhere.
Where if you go with me, then you can put it in the car.
Hang on a minute.
both sat there  
What day would you go?
I can't, I'm not going Friday, because I'm playing

It's like you could do, that  but this quality, and you could do this  and that really 
Neat.
Thin as well.
I don't  any of them.
Right.
Don't make any .
It's good, it's  
 
Slightly expensive at  innit.
 
two hundred pounds second hand.
Yeah, I know that.
Laser, it be out already 
How much was it, did you buy it.
Yeah, borrowed it.
My friend bought it for two hundred pounds second-hand.
Where it's usually about four or five hundred.
cost about four or five hundred.
It's usually about four or five hundred, he bought it second-hand for two hundred quid.
definitely it looks better.
printer.
Yeah.
would.
That one's, quite good they are.
I know, that one's better, but that one looks better.
I suppose  can't keep up.
Yeah, looks like it.
It's good, though.
When I first  I thought it was a laser printer.
I I would buy a bubble-jet.
I was going to buy a laser, but I  buy a bubble-jet.
Yeah.
And it, you don't have to keep changing all the paper, you just  and it does it.
And you're, do you thing com ever run out of 
Paper like that 
Yeah
Being a businessman.
Yeah, but you could turn it round.
you know, like, I don't know, you  copies, so get out 
No, right  
annually 
No, as long as you've got the paper.
Mm.
Which we take from school anyway.
What?
Then you only get 
Yeah.
Mm.
Erm, you see the quality.
It's good quality, that.
The best quality.
I've done m is there, are there any gaps in between, if you put it on the good quality  like, can you see any spaces?
No.
Well, can't you see it on that?
Li li I mean, something like this.
older than you.
No, no, you wo , do you mean, like,
say on that.
gaps, like lines through it, or 
Yeah, 'cos like,la laser printers like  perfect  the one I've seen, I don't know.
It's perfect, it was perfect.
I mean, I've got a  
Do you agree, then.
I'll show you.
Did you cop copied it off today.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.


So why are you doing it on the 
Because I'm still gonna read through it 
The  colour 
Laser printer thing 
Right  that can 
printed in full yet.
As long as it's 
Yeah.
Is that what it's gonna look like.
Like the four hundred.
It's okay then.
The one I saw  it was the same  plain.
You know 
I'm not 
You like that, you like 
Print  printing it 
It's gonna be like two.
Yeah.
I got everything 
Apart from that 
Apart from what?
That.
Ar.
They've updated it.
It was probably   I wonder what 
Three.
Three.
If you got engaged, do you want us to do 
for your friend.
What.
you know, your best friend's, how how can you do your best friend's  like that.

Don't  
all got one drive.
Yeah, everyone I know.
give you one drive and half 
Some way er,
Some people still got half 
Yeah, I know.
How can you half meg, you're in er, when like, when I first got my computer, get half meg extra was about a hundred pound, yeah, for the  one.
It was about a hundred pound to get, so obviously, you know, there was still people with half meg.
Mm.
Because they  can't  
Twenty, twenty-five pound.
No, listen up, you get about twenty pounds.
It went down.
Yeah I know.
Twenty pounds like,wh 
I didn't bother getting a drive,be because I sold my computer, but I was gonna get one.
And you need the drive as well, drive 
Yeah, I mean  got one  and 
But you know, you see some people with just half, you know, that is stupid, they can't play  best game.
What, the best games are the ones with one meg.
They're like  whatever.
Yeah.
 

bought his computer after me and he didn't get, he didn't get all the parts because it's, shouldn't got it 
probably buy it cheaper.
Mhm.
Normal price.
No, he  got it cheap.
What would you say, he got it for more.
Why does it say three disks.
It's not three disks, it's four.
Must be  released it.
Which isn't all that good.
The background  the animation of the people isn't very good, but otherwise it's go I  it's good.
That Tournament's meant to be good, I haven't heard it yet.
Yeah, it's alright.
Eight people.
It's the best in the  definitely  it's got, nowhere does it beat 
Most, you the thing most  to me,
Mhm.
Two games fit on one disk.
Yeah, I I couldn't buy, buy the one disk.
You couldn't  one disk, what he's got 
If, or, you, I think he buys them off the man in the market.
Yeah, but has he got the actual copier.
Mhm.
So he buys  how much does he get it for, do you know?
No.
He's got erm,
I'll get 'em for you, quite cheap.
Not Flashback, another wa , he's got another 
Quite cheap.
I often  
How much.
He's got  when I said 
How much does he buy it for, he got, he buys it from the market.
What market, do you know.
Right, could you ask him.
What market does he buy it from.
Which one, yeah, and what the prices are, and I'll find out the price for, I probably be able to get it cheaper, because the guy who I buy the Mega stuff off,
Mhm.
erm, the games for it, and I'll be able to get it off him cheap.
Yeah.
Because I'm already getting the music stuff off him.
Well, it won't be much, it'll be you know 
What kind 
Wow, look at that man, look at at that, look at that.
That's a normal picture.
Ain't no normal picture, man.
In the middle of a game.
That's  middle of a game.
I know, I've seen I've seen the game.
Are you not  do that.
Yeah, but look at it, man.
Yeah, you put that on any computer.
No.
Picture like that.
No.
What do you mean, no.
No.
You can't do it on that.
not coloured.
Yo you probably can't tell the difference.
You get four thousand and whatever colours on there.
Yeah.
So you get two hundred and fifty-six thousand.
Yeah, but they don't use all the different shades,
It.
do they?
It does.
Yeah, it does.
It does.
Some pictures mi , and that'll be animated like that, games would be like that.
 
You know the games like  I can borrow them, if that's all, look at that, brilliant graphics.
game like that.
game like that.

So when you're selling a computer, I thought you were selling into er,

No one 's gonna buy unless you go and put it in a 
And you have to do 
Yeah, I know.
I was lucky that two people was asking 
I know people, I know, three people that want to sell their Amega, including 
Yeah, I know.
You're lucky.
It's true, you know.
Yeah, I know.
I sold it for a reasonable price.
Only a week after I said I was gonna sell it.
What  you say, about twenty-three pound  from a 
Mhm.
Between twenty and twenty-five.
So it's, there's a hundred and eighty.
What even new.
Yeah, they go for about, I don't know, you see some for about one fifty-nine.
Yeah, I know, that's why my friend says  
in all that, but with games and everything 
I know.
from about hundred and fifty pound you could pay.
And they  just one double, about that much  disks, not many.
No, you don't want 
About ten pound worth of disks, 'cos they're only colour disks, cheap things.
Look at that  man.
That would flicker on the thingy.
That, oh  would that flicker, this picture?
Yeah, that would, yeah.
I know, but it's on the twelve hundred.
No, it wouldn't, alright on that monitor it would.
On that monitor.
Mm.


A good song.
Why don't you get some 
Amega five hundred computer, with many games, so obviously he's got pirates, with many games, once you  box  mint condition, with everything in mint condition, hundred and seventy pound.
look after my computer, I'll be 


You don't dust your computer or anything, or else you get all them colours.
I leave the dust alone.
Did they say it's worth  buying it.
This one's rubbish, look, amega five hundred   with mouse and joy-stick, all leads, modulator, no games, hundred and twenty-five pound.
I didn't give them my mouse, er, I gave 'em the mouse but no joy-stick.

Ten copied games, also uses manual games, includes Arcade Karati, Chase H Q.

the Show Man, I wanted to get myself that.
Shouldn't have bought those blank disks.
Still that's good news.

How come.
Like to get one cheap, it's not worth it.
Pity.
Not worth it, man.
Wh wh what we're gonna do to a twelve hundred that we can't do here.
Play wicked amazing super games.
Yeah, but I don't  I ever do is copy.
The Word Processing er, erm  games now.
two hundred different colours.
Yeah, man.
It's the best.
Who cares about compatibility, if they're just
See when the Amega first came out, five hundred, they  ain't it.
Yeah.
They were rubbish.
That's what these games are like.
In a cou in about two years, the Amega drive is gonna be so good.
Sure.
Two hundred and fifty  that's what you're gonna be sent.
All I can say is, I'd better not be wrong.
What made you decide to sell your top 
I haven't sold it yet.
What, you mean you might, decide just, that you decide to sell it, anyway.
Yeah, I want to sell.
What made you.
Twelve hundred.
Er.
I thought you'd gone a bit shitty.
I like the graphics.
Ah, do you reckon that could be the picture,
Yeah, that is the picture.
It looks the same, dunnit.
Yeah, but that's animated, it's just shh, and all these things background.
That's alright, the game's shit.
Isn't it, though.
Yeah.
It's not that brilliant.
And a lovely picture, well, it was alright at the beginning.


That's the exactly the same as the five hundred version, innit.
Yeah.
Slows down, you know.
Well, look out, read it, read it, read it, the bottom line, read it.
Was it a record now.
Yeah.
What does it say.
In places, it doesn't fair  as the previous incarnation.
When the screen gets busy it lasts at least background strain your eyes after a while.
Well,a wanker, though, ain't he.
Oh.
background, I don't understand that about  you're probably dazzled, you're probably dazzled by, it might slow down, because de-programming has probably just took the old one, and just made it 
Possibly.
But look at Lionheart, they said that's, that's that plays perfectly, you know when you running and those pikes come in underneath you.
What 
read it, read it.
As with the normal version, it is a very good game that's worthy of your cash if you've got a twelve hundred.
Get, but, get this, however, if you haven't got a twelve hundred, and get this,version and control yourself, the fact that you're missing much  is worth it 
Yeah 
I got that down.

While you're waiting for the kettle to boil  get a cup from the cupboard and put one so , erm  teaspoonful of coffee in it and then put two spoonful of sugar.
Then, after the kettle has boiled you pour  the hot water into the cup and add the milk and stir it together and that's how you make a cup of coffee.
Well if you want you can add cake or anything.
Have coffee and cake , Yeah,and coffee and biscuits .

While you're waiting for the kettle to boil  erm, get a cup from the cupboard and a tea bag from the tea jar, put tea bag in the  the cup and then wait for the kettle to boil  and o , once the kettle has boiled  you put your hot water into the cup  and le , and let the tea brew for a little while And then, after you let it brew you can either add milk to it or, do not add milk to it.

Yeah slags!
But, and now, and now we're gonna go to the things what  parents have  wrong, like their, like, they spoil their child and everything at home.
Or, here's a letter that was sent to me by  Teresa   from Birmingham.
Dear Anthony, our five year old son, our five year old daughter is a very bad loser.
When we play games with her sh , and she doesn't win she either gets upset  and  cries or gets angry.
We've trying showing her that  we don't mind when we lose but it doesn't seem to work  work.
Any ideas ?
Well yeah, for,we ,what I will say to you is, try giving her a surprise, when you  when you or the father lose again  you should react by getting upset or angry.
This is serious suggestions, often children can learn  from seeing themselves as others see them.


When you get angry about losing your husband can,yo ha , losing your husband can ask for his wife, from your daughter about how to deal with it?
Do this lightly so you can  so she can see  you're  you are acting and doesn't get frightened.
Yet, seriously enough so  she hasn't had  she hasn't, so she has an opportunity to put herself  in your shoe.
If you feel this  too much to do for you, stick to what you are, are already doing.
Don't pay close attention to the detail.
What happens, when you do show her you mind losing what do you next, what do you do next?
And how can you tell her  you don't want to play any more games or, if you analyse her reactions carefully  you'll see how some encourage  encouraging, that changes your looking, for you, for you're likely to find she begins to, to modify her behaviour .
That was from Teresa  from Birmingham.
Now I wanna go onto a Dear Anne one, which is very interesting.
Hold on.
Right.
Dear Anne, can I give him up?
I'm divorced forty ye , I'm a divorced forty year old woman with two grown up children  and I am in a terrible situation.
The thing is that  my  infa , infatuated with my  bo with my daughter's boyfriend who is also my son's best friend.
It started when I, when I came home drunk after his, like,.
He was  started flirting with me saying how older women turn  on.
I was flattered.
And one thing led to another.
Af , I thought that first time would be the last, but since this, Steve's been dropping in during the day  while my son and daughter are at work.
I know this  sorried affair is wrong, that I end up breaking my daughter's heart, or upsetting my son, son's ha , but  I don't think I can give up Steve?
Am I feeling desperate?
Can you help ?
Well  one thing is fucking kick him out!
In our fucking house!
Kick him out your house!
Or you move and leave your kids at home really, that's what I'd do.
And there's another one.
Am I prepared too old?
Perhaps I'm too hold, old.
I am a twenty seven year old woman who can't swim.
I've never enjoyed a beach holidays because  I'm too scared to go in the water.
Now my moth , now  my friends at the mother, mother and baby group have joined the water babies class at the local pool, but I feel so nervous I can't go.
How can someone my age learn to swim.
Summer is coming this year and I really want to learn .


Well, what you do is you go to your nearest leisure centre and  ask if you could do the  training classes for the adults who can't sa , who can't swim yet.
And then, by about four months performance you should be able to do about ten metres whatever, you can do.
Okay?
Okay?
Bye.
Yeah, and here's a little funny picture out of the newspaper.
There's a woman in the be and there's a man underneath the bed and it's got  underneath it,Frank, can't you forget you are a mechanic for once?

Do this the next day.
You got your diagram of a square there.
Yeah I know this.
Oh  .
Let's just go through it.
Okay?


Carl  have a look at this.
First of all there are two types of environment.
Cos in a moment you're gonna be writing this up.
You're gonna be writing an explanation of this.
Will we sir?
Okay?
Yes sir.
!
Oh!
Enterprise there.
Can you follow the diagram as I go through it.
There are two types  of environment.
Shh shh!
Your environment
Human  and physical.
So in your opening paragraph, that's what you say.
What is  the human made up of please Anthony?
Of  
 
Shh!
Anthony!
Sorry?
What are the three parts of it please?
Nations, population  level of development.
Nations, population, and level of development.
Now then  I don't know if she talked to you 
 
about this.
Do you know about the levels of development?
No.
Didn't think you did.
There are three levels of development  and you're gonna have to explain this this morning, so just watch.
This is  an aid memoir, what's an aid memoir?
Aid memoir?
A memory.
Memory.
Are they memories or 
An aid to your memories.
This is not, this is not  one hundred percent accurate.
It is  a generality.
What I say on here  you will 
Might not 
always find
will be different wouldn't it?
slight differences in the real world.
Okay?
This is  you remember I've told you about geography bottles, yeah?
It's a rough guide.
.
So there are three types  of industries.
What are they please?
Joy?
 
Sorry?
Three kinds of industry, Joy.
Listen!
,
La ,Joy !
You've got yourself a page full of lines.
I'm sick and tired of these people shouting out!
Choose a proper one and hand it in by one fifty, today.
So you can do it in your lunch hour.
Three types of industry Joy?
Secondary
Good!
Primary  secondary  what's another word for ins for primary  industry please  er  Craig?
Er er
Another word for it.
Dunno.
Go on.
Something that was there at the time?
No,na , no, look!
 
At least he's trying fellas!
Mark?
Er, number one, the first.
No.
Premium.
No.
Go on.
Renewable.
No.
It's using  natural  resources.
Gimme an example please.
Pardon?
Gimme an example of a primary industry!
Put your hands down!?
What's a, what's a ma , give me an example of a natural resource for this group?
Danny?
Coal.
Coal.
So give me  an example, Daniel, of  an industry using a natural resource.
Er er  lumberjack.
Er  lumberjacking.
Give me another one, Anthony?
Oil.
Carl?
Coal mining.
Coal mining.
Anything that's come from the ground is a primary industry, or farming.
Coal mining or farming  is using natural  resources.


Okay.
Secondary.
What's another word for a secondary industry please?
Manufacturing.
Good.
Manufacturing.
Want to give me 
 
an example of a manufacturing industry Carl?
Manufacturing.
I don't know sir.
Kazie?
Think then!
Manufacturing.
What is manufacturing?
What's another work for manufa 
Making.
Making.
Making.
You give me something that's made Kazie?
Your clothes!
Chairs.
The chair industry in manufacturing.
Cars, paints
Industrial.
and factories.
Yeah, training shoes, carpet, stereo, look around, they're all around, do you understand that?
Mm.
Pardon?
Yes sir.
So manufacturing, such as the car  industry.
tertiary, please?
In other words Adam?
Service industry.
Service sector.
Gimme an example of a service industry please?
Richard?
I said put your hands 
Selling.
please.
Selling.
Selling.
Shopkeeping.
Another one?
Car sales.
Car se , yeah, shops, any sort of shop or
Emergency 
What about 
service.
Doctors, accountant, civil service, public employees, dustman.
Okay?
So there's your 
 
three types of industry.
Any job  which sector for example would running a hotel come in?
Running a hotel, which sector would it come under?
Right, these are sector.
What's a sector in mathematics please?
The area.
Well, well, a 
area.
a, a part, yeah.
These are three types of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, so give me which sector is the hotel industry in?
Secondary?
No.
Do you make hotels?


So, what do you do when you go to a hotel?
You stop there don't you?
So, what sector is it?
Tertiary.
Tertiary.
Cos it's providing a  service.
Service.
If you go on holiday and there aren't any hotels, you're gonna be sleeping outside with the stars.
You'll be back again.
Can you give me an example of  the  electrician.
Service.
Which sector is the electrician in?
Service.
Service.
Which i , which sector is the house builder in?
Secondary.
Secondary.
Cos he's ma making houses.
Which sector is the lawyer in?
Tertiary.
Tertiary.
Which sector is the research assistant in a laboratory.
Primary.
No.
Sectors?
Secondary.
Tertiary.
No.
Well, secondary.
No.
They're in the quaternary sector.


Yeah, sir, you know you said the house builders are secondary if they're making something, they're also providing a service though aren't they?
But tha , well so is the person who makes shoes.
Cos if we didn't have somebody making shoes  we'd all be walking round bare foot.
See what I mean?
Yep.
Yeah?
A person who's  make tables, yeah?
He's providing a service  but in th the prime role, yeah?
Mm.
Okay?
The person is 
 
who, for example, who makes medicine  yeah?
He's in the manufacturing industry but they're providing a service.
Yeah?
Yeah.
The person who sells the house  yeah?
So if he sells he's tertiary.
Is the tertiary.
quaternary sector you do not need to know about.
Okay?
But quaternary sector is anybody who's into research or  er  high international finance and banking.
Yeah?
It's a new one that's only just been around  for the last fifty years.
Okay?
But just for your information.
You do not need to know that.
But most jobs  all jobs in fact  could be divided into these sectors.
Because you could say  international banking  could go into the ser , tertiary sector.
Sir?
Is this for the key stage three  what we're doing?
.
No.
Oh that's alright then.
We're not doing that.


You don't come under key stage until you go into  wa er er  year eight I think it is.
Okay?
Right, so these are the three sectors.
Now, there are three  types of country  and these are  types of country.


Right.
Boy!
Now then  the way that you categorize countries  what do I mean categorize?


Well catori 
Put them in order.
Put them them into, not order that's rank, a different
Like primary, secondary and
Put into 
Sir.
different categories.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like , for what they're good at 
Well 
developing 
Okay.
or whatever.
Now then


a country that has  less developed countries 
 
have  this is a graph now, yeah?
Less developed countries  sit down quickly boy.
Less developed countries have some primary industry.
They have  very little


secondary industry  but they have  even less  tertiary.
Now this  is based on area, for example, d'ya remember  we looked at


what's this country?


Brazil.
Brazil.
Which part  is the rich
North Brazil.
which part is rich?
South part.
South 
South.
So here  there is service and there is some
Manufacturing.
manufacturing.
It's changing because of the, what project?
 
Environment.
In the north  there isn't.
Okay?
There is 
 
a lot more  primary.
What primary activities are happening in the northern part of Brazil.
Mining.
The cutting down of trees.
The cutting down of trees.
What else?
Farming.
Farming.
What else?
Coal mining.
Mining.
Right.
They do some man , this  is increasing.
But it's only happening in some  less developed countries.
Can anybody say why it's happening in so , some countries?
You know I said jobs are divided into primary, secondary, tertiary, some, all countries can divide, can divide it up into less developed, developing, and developed.
So  tell me then, why do only some less developed countries have primary industries.
Cos they ain't got the companies to build up the 
No.
things.
Not the companies.
They ain't got the 
People.
No.
I was gonna say they ain't got the things to do it.
No.
They haven't got any coal.
They haven't got any trees.
For example, a country that's in the da , in the desert  with no 
India.
trees.
India.
No fish.
No land to farm.
Yeah?
And, and no  mines or minerals underneath the ground, can that have a lot of primary industry?
No.
No.
So there's some countries in the desert  around the Gobi desert  that don't have any primary industry.
Do you understand that?
Yes?
Now  they have some secondary  industry.
Cos every country has to make some sort of farming tools, has to make some plates, you know you've seen photographs and you've seen pictures, some countries all have some sort of factory.
They don't have big factories like they have at Dagenham, but small, what I call  almost  they are called these.


Cottage industries.
What do you think I mean by cottage industries?
A small .
Small.
You know what a cottage is, it's a small house.
These are small industries.
Remembering, of course, that there will be some big industries, this is just general, okay?
If you think of a less developed country, you might find some big industry, this is just a way to divide the .
Now then, developing countries  have much more raw materials  industry, and that is still increasing.
They have more  secondary, and they have more  area  but it's still  spatial.
Because Brazil  is an example of a developing country.
would use that much mining now, it's small .
Well because what they do is  what do you think they do with the goods they dig out the ground?
They don't use it?
It's mostly for
Export.
export.


Same as here, this is for 
 
export.
And this, is just  beginning.
And it's mostly  multi-national companies that run it.
Okay?
Finally, a developed country  has


much less  primary.
Carl.
Has a lot more  secondary, but  it is changing.
Do we now, for example, make  er  big ships like we used to?
Yeah.
No.
No.
We make a lot of computers and things like that don't we?
Changing the  what we make or manufacture.
What do, gimme an example of a multi-national country, multi-national company in a developing country that makes things?
Sanyo.
What?
Sanyo.
Yes.
Where are they made?
Where are, where are Nike trainers made?
Nike.
Area, er America.
Korea.
Yeah.
They're made in Korea.
Yeah?
That is a developing country, but it's a multi-national company.
What's a multi- national company Craig?
Er
Look at the word.
It's company that's got  bases in
Yeah.
All over the
Yeah, many different countries.
Have you seen the er  what's the advert with the globe?
Is it I C I or  B P?
Reebok.
No.
The globe.


I C I.
Yeah, the one with erm cream on it's face.
That one.
Erm, where  
That's a toothpaste ad though.
British Airways sir, is it?
No.
Mu , British Airways is a multi-national company.
I C I is.
I C I is.
It's I C I.
Yeah?
You got o , I C I.
Er ,.
Okay.
No it's not.
But we have a lot
American Express sir?


Yeah.
American Express!
Yeah.
Shows you on there.
Is a multi- national 
 
company.
It is a multi-company.
Yeah.
You're right.
We have a lot of tertiary.
Now these  what do you think the E stands for?
Everything.
Export.
Sorry.
Engage.
No , think!
Yeah.
We don't export some tertiary services do we?
Exchange.
Exchange things.
Yeah.
E equals
I don't know.
Enterprise.
No.
I don't know.
Employ in that sector.
Employee.
Okay?
So the number of people 
 
in the country employed in that sector.


About a hundred, two hundred years ago we had ninety five percent of people  i in this country were employed in farming.
Now, these countries have ninety five percent, and they will gro , gradually grow  into a developed country.
Do you remember last year  when we had the population graph that went like that?
Well yeah, the birth rate.
And in nineteen fifty  in U K
It started to rise.
Yeah?
Nineteen fifty in Brazil  was exactly where  it was eighteen fifty for the U K.
Do you remember?
Compared the two graphs.
Okay?
So now you understand levels of development.
There are three levels of development, what are they Richard?
Less developed, developing, and
Okay.
developed.
And e , do you understand this?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
Going back to  this.
Because when you come to write this up  you need to include this.
Yeah.
Okay.


Physical environment.


And there you have your third type


coming up.
You have, sorry, would you
Yeah.
okay you have, what's geology please?
Geography.
No!
Otherwise it would have written geography on there!
 
It's like saying what's a Ford?
It's actually 
 
Ford Fiesta.
Sir.
Is it like looking up something?
Geology
is rocks.
You got rocks in there .
Sir, some rocks have got hole in it, you know that?
You know?
Right.


Okay?
So the first thing in geology, why is geology important?
Cos you got 
What the rock is like?
cos you got materials in it that we need.
Yeah.
Like tin, or iron, or gold  or even
Minerals.
Erm 
Zinc.
oil.
Gold.
Or zinc, any of those.
Right.
Climate?
Weather.
Why is that important please?
Which sector really might the climate and weather help?
Er
Primary.
Primary.
Why?
Cos it's farming.
To grow it.
Farming.
Another sector?
Secondary.
Why secondary?
Tertiary.
 
Secondary could help because what happens if there's a lot of water?
You could put a hydro-electric dam up there which could help electricity, which could help your industry.
Yeah?
And finally, tertiary sector, why is climate and weather useful for tertiary sector?
Why is climate, what happens when it's really, really hot?
You got fans.
People go away .
What do you mean you gotta buy fans?
No.
People go


on holiday.


People go on holiday there.


Okay?
Get the fans out.


The next section.
Animals and plants.
Animals and plants, is obviously  to do with
Tertiary.
Farming.
farming, because, for example, you can't keep  er er strawberries  in the cold.
Because they'd die.


You ought to be a farmer when you grow up.


You'd make a fortune.
Okay.
And the fourth sector.
Shops.
No.
Scenery, landscape.
Why is that important please?
So like  you're not 
Sir.
damaging the environment.


Pardon?
Not,yo , you're not damaging the environment.


What?
People come
No.
This is a picture  of a map of Japan.
Is it?
Yeah.


Looks like a gu water pistol.
All of Japan


inside


There's no environment 
The brown 
there.
is mountain.
Can you build cities on top of the mountains?
No.
Can you build factories on top of the mountains?
No.
Most of the mountains are all volcanoes anyway.
There's a lot of earthquakes there.
So most of your cities
Yeah.
There aren't any.
Are round the edge of it.
Around the edge of it.
Sir, where's the wall then?
Where's the
The wall.


The wool?
Yeah the wall.


What wall?
The great wall?
They gotta wall.
Great wall of China?


China's not in Japan.
.


They got a wall !
Okay.
Let's move on.
Okay.
Yeah, there are flat
The building's .
Yeah.
And soil.
Why is soil important?
So you can grow more resources.
Cos farming involves the crops.
What?
So you grow more resources.
No you can't.  the what?
Crops.
Farming.
Farming.
Crops, yeah.
Okay.


Now then the physical environment leads onto those three types of resources and they are  renewable
Aha.
, what, what's  mean?
What have we been 
 
calling it?
Not renewable.  sounds like finish which means that eventually they will
Die.
run out.
Give me an example of a renewable resource please?
Trees.
Renewable!
 
Paper.
No.
Sir!
Actual resource, come on.
Coal.
Renewable!
Once you burn coal  die, it's dead.
Oil.
Water.
Plastic.
Water.
Water.


Yes,whe when you go to farmers grow plastic trees.


In the future, yeah.
Coal.
Seen it
Water, coal.
Mm.
New word for you aesthetic.
Have you ever come across that  in 
Yeah.
art?
Mm.
Nah.
Aesthetic means, it means, it is very much like the, everybody wants to look at it.


Alright sir.
Thought it was you three.
Okay.


Factors needed for life?
Residence.
Residence.
What's that mean?
Anthony?
for a house where you can live in or 
A house or a box.
Yes.
 
A house or box.
Okay?
Food, why do we need food?
To keep ourselves alive.
To keep us alive.
Energy.
No.
Energy.
You don't need it though.
Why do we need work?
Exercise.
No.
So we , so we can our bills.
Money, to get money.

They don't mean going dancing.
Erm, you  
Keep kicking ya.
No.
Transport.
And keeping
And  
Transport of people.
Good.
Cathy.
And
Movements.
movements 
 
of  residence.
What?
What?
The same as you do for planting 
 
trees.
I can see it now  .
Information technology and ideas
T V.
Oh
Computers
Computers 
Telephone 
and 
and video
telephone and improvement in 
Compact disc.
technology.
What happened if there are improvements in technology in the industry?
No more workers.
Right.
Okay.
All these things  provide economic systems.
Agricultural, industrial, and service.
Are they the same as pra , are, are they the same as primary, secondary, and tertiary.
Yeah.
No!
No.
No.
Daniel!
Er er
er er er!


Agricultural is not coal mining unless you eat coal!


Ah?
Industrial.
Okay?
These are systems.
One provides us with food, one provi , puts  bits together  and the other provides us with a service.
Okay?
Then there is the cycle as you can see.
Those three factors there, human, physical, and systems go together into that circle there.
Carl, you'll be writing this up and you won't be able to do it!
Those are individual, locational decisions.
What do we mean by that?
Individual locational decisions.
Well look back to the factors needed for life first of all.
People decide where they're gonna live  and what they're gonna live in.
People decide what food they want, what to buy.
People decide where they're gonna work, or have no, that sorted out.
People decide what leisure facilities they're gonna use.


People decide what other systems they're gonna have, for example, people I know still won't buy a television, or a video, or a satellite dish, or a microwave.
Right?
They won't do it.
They don't want to have that.
Yes?
People decide whether to opt into the health service or
Doctors.
BUPA.
or BUPA.


Spit it out.
Movement.
People decide whether to use public transport, buy a car
Go on the bus.
Bus.
move house, move country, move region.
How d'ya move a country ?
What?
How d'ya move a country?
No move from a country


from one country to another.


Okay?


These companies decide whether  where and when to work, where and when to build.
Why do you think  Fords decided to build at Dagenham?
Cos there's lots of space.
It's a city.
A lot of space.
A city.
Spaces.
Lots of reasons.
They didn't just say  you know, er er er
Dagenham Motors.
there 


we'll build there.
Mm.
Do you ever 
Cos there's 
does anybody ever watch the news where they say  Japanese company decide to locate in Manchester, or whatever.
Yeah?
Mm.
No?


It should do, Carl 
Cos they get a nice profit.
 
You should do Carl!
divvy!
You know, not just watch bloody Bart Simpson!
 
Do I, do I ever.
Right?
People, why do people, why do people move to work on the Docklands?
Cos they, cos they 
Money.
live near it.
Or they're quicker.
 
It's in the city now.
No.
when you moved here not to pay rent.
Wo oh.
There are lots of reasons why people choose.
And then when people choose it creates what's there, a spatial pattern.
And what are spatial patterns?
Areas.
Space patterns.
