He doesn't understand them.
So she was telling him.
Oh she said he seems quite interested

Well don't they have cheaper ones there?
Well how much ?well I think it is Pat, that's why I asked because Angela was saying some  er it was gonna be nine pound and that was with the   well I think I'll have to   
  

Oh it's like a den of iniquity in here,.
Remember that time in Marks when we went to Marks she stood there smoking?
She didn't see a dickie bird to me, not a word.
Blackpool.
Er at Blackpool.
Cos Rita swears she's been , I mean I was out with her once and we went in for a coffee and we finished, right, and we're ready to go and I nearly said to her  I hate it after  you've finished and Jackie lights up and then I have to sit there while she has a fag
Mm.
and it 
I go to  sometimes.
  

I'm sure she thinks I've put her off from coming up.
But we were gonna go to the cemetery  couple of weeks ago and it weren't very nice.
But we haven't been for months.
Got  coming up Friday  well it means that I  you know  which I'm gonna have to do anyway Saturday, so I'll take him in and I'll go down early 
Well Rachael got  Carole.
She said this morning am I gonna pay for it tomorrow or on Friday

Well she comes up Friday and on Saturday.
Well we've booked it now.
What's that?
Read that red car over there, please, the number plate

Yeah that's with the, it's,do doesn't come with the
said that was two ninety nine for the brush and one ninety nine for 
  

It was freezing in that car today, he kept opening the window.
You should take a coat.
He, he leaves his coat on see right and I don't  with a coat so he opens his window cos he's hot, I'm freezing.
Say excuse me  shut the window.
I  and I couldn't believe it I actually did it right.
You've gotta actually do it right on your test.
This girl, Anne, yesterday she said  she clipped the kerb and  and  said as long as erm  you have another  
 
He said you probably need another lesson to brush up on your  
She clipped a kerb.
They usually judge the parking  
She  she passed that and she ha he said that just have another lesson on your  your test and you'll be alright.
He passed her, and he was known for being crappy.
Do you know the Highway Code?
No.
Mind you all the questions he's asked me yesterday I answered.
I could have done that .
Nothing else, just the Highway Code.
You could have been driving 
I thought I knew it
but there were some of the things in there and I just didn't expect them to ask me, and it wasn't in the book like.
 
He asked me about erm if you broke down on a motorway where would you stop.
I said well on the hard shoulder, I said, you can't stop nowhere else .
So then he said to me how would you  I said  so he went yes, I said and  and he said and how would you put it back, I said  
Well what if you haven't got one?
I said  he said, I said well I haven't got one anyway so it don't matter.
Yeah but they're not gonna say that at my test, if you haven't got one it don't matter.
You'd better start learning that Highway Code.
I, he asked me the one, you know, we were on about this morning, the only one we looked at, fifty miles an hour and he asked me  that one  and I knew it .
It was the only one I knew  this morning like, so  fifty miles an hour he said to me   He said to me, he said to me turn left at the roundabout  there was only one that was marked on the floor, only one an actual erm roundabout with concrete and I drove  straight over it  
 

Well didn't you see the sign for it?
There was a sign but it was  and it was just cracked so cars behind me were just driving over it and nobody could, you can't see it.
She killed three pedestrians  but she's alright.
 

 
Said if I wasn't awake I'm well and bloody truly awake now.
What?
I said if I wasn't awake I'm well and truly awake now.
I hear you got up at one.
Ah!
Right Jon?
Yeah.
Come on then.
I ended up 


and I stood there  den of iniquity in here, with the three of them, and luckily she wasn't paying attention, she went on to something else and they all looked at me and burst out laughing.
Those two are laughing, they don't know what they're laughing about.
a fish tank ?
Yeah I was  coming up now I should think, she told Claire that she'd bought one and Claire said oh she could have had this  so I said oh I said 
?
that's er one of those upright ones in there she said yeah I thought Claire might be interested in that and so I was thinking it was like the ones we've seen but it's not, it's completely round  and it's on erm like a stand like that, you know, it's an upright 
It looks nice when, you know, when it's lit up.
It's alright 
 
but I don't like the orange on it.
She bought it for Shaun.
It was a wedding present actually but she said he don't bother with it, it's behind a chair now, the fish are still in it but it's stuck behind a chair.
 
Well if she wants if she wants to get rid of it  ask her how much she wants for it.
Well ask Carole to ask her, if she, she wants to get rid of it how much she wants for it.
Cos the st er you could, you  might be able to take the stand  cos it's gotta be pretty er hefty.
I don't know if she's got cold water or tropical 
Don't make any difference.
Has she got a pump in it?
Oh, I dunno.
Suggest we go and assist this lady.
See we er we tried to get  and it was about ten to twelve  so I thought, I thought Carole wasn't coming till the next bus so I'd go down  and pick her up.
go down and meet the bus  so we're sat there now ten past  eleven and I thought  I hope we haven't missed it now and she's walked up, she's standing out the door cos I'd locked the door.
I said we'd better go home and check and so we drove down to  and as I got there, so the bus comes up, so it looked pretty but I thought well I'd better check so I followed it back up and nobody got off it and 
So you clocked twenty mile just following empty buses.
So I turned round then and said right  said to Sharan I'll drop you off at the house and I said when she's ready I'll walk up to the shop.
So I said I'd better make sure she's in, so Sharan knocks on the door, no answer.
I said oh I hope she hasn't got another bus so Sharan said I think there is two buses cos whenever I meet mum it's always a little blue bus and this was a big orange   I said well we'll call at the shop I said and if erm  not we'll have to go home.
So as we were going along she was just going into the paper shop  and she was on her way up to the one o'clock bus, so I called in to see Jackie and had a coffee and then we come home.
Oh.
I said we've gotta be home before Michelle cos I had the key, for some reason I put it in my pocket 


No.
Righto.
It is.
I can read in my bedroom when I can't sleep  
 
I don't think that she wants anything for it
Yes she does
cos she keeps saying to me oh when you have that bloody tank  she keeps nagging and nagging to have it.
The fish as well?
I don't want it cos I've got er
Yeah.
goldfish  
 
the fish but
What are they, cold water?
It's just like Michelle's with er one pump in there.
Does it have a light ?
There's a, there's a light you've gotta plug, switch for the light
So it's actually in with the tank is it?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She tried to give it to me  
Cos I was telling her that you bought one she said oh why didn't you tell her, she could have had mine.
The thing is that in my bedroom 
It was sat behind the settee in a corner.
I haven't seen it for about two months.
Yeah.
I remember seeing it when we went to that party, and I know, cos it would have been lit up  
I wonder where she got it.
I don't know.
They're all bigger than yours though.
and like when he cleans them, all he does is change like that pump thing and wipe the glass.
Well he does that so often.
And like when he cle does the water he just changes half of it and you know keeps half in and just wipes the glass, just wipes the glass off.
Because he said the water 
 
he said is cleaned cos it all goes in that pump thing
Yeah.
it's the glass you've gotta  wipe so that's all he does.
Oh well  might get it after all.
Yeah.
and put the thing in with it.
Mm you'll have to  as well.
There's a plug in the garage but I ain't going in the garage.


Turkey.
What?
Turkey.
Turkey?
The first time I ever got it I  what do you want me to do and he said right run across there and I'd run  now punch it, and I'd be punching the  you'd be jumping and turning round, I couldn't get the right one , and finally punch it and the  would be coming, said quick hit that and  I was getting all sort of 
on it now.
I'm quite good at that bit now
She has at least an hour a day on it.
And when I  didn't even look in this morning, I just, I wasn't  
Are you on that Sega!
I went in to see the cats and then I swept up all the mess 
She sees she sees to the cats and then she stays in the  see you've gotta keep him company  
It's a bit pongy in there at the moment.
You can  
 
you've got  as well have you?
It's a telephone number actually.
I know.
Blind or what.
So tell me more about this job in er Manchester.
I told you about it .
You told me nothing.
I have!
I dunno what you're on about!
Oh when I come in she said will you miss me when I go to Manchester.
I, didn't I tell him ?
Yeah, yeah but tell us  
But we don't know any details yet.
Yeah.
Is this true?
Well she could stop there couldn't she if she wanted to.
Er they were thinking of coming back on Sunday  
I thought he was on two days.
Look if I've gotta tell you that one more time now I'm gonna scream!
That was only that one week  
Oh that's the one week was it?
back on the  
On the Sunday because they're going back  Friday right after new year's day
that is  given the Thursday and Friday off so now he's a full week  except for Thursday when he's in college.
God!
Put it down to age Michelle.
Age?
I've told him four times.


Well I thought he was on two days.
Well.
Thought he was on two days four times.
Well you know what thought did don't you?
Well I thought he was on eight days then.


You hungry?
No.
Good cos you ain't getting nothing here.
My favourite, my favourite niece can have some though.
Where were you then when Carole was walking up the street?
I didn't see you.
In the shop.
   
how long have we been here?
Give me the, the lighter.
Thank you.
Well if you want to go, go help yourself.
 

She even knows the music now.
When I went to Asdas on the first day when he was telling me about erm sales, loads of people erm  
Well he's  to isn't he?
 
one he's got now is that one  car, and he had another car driving one didn't he?
Yeah, the Grand Prix, that was rubbish, that Grand Prix .
Especially compared to the  one.
Mm.
I thought that was harder though cos you had to keep changing 
I had it on automatic 
Yeah well I didn't know you could change gear I just thought it was automatic.
You don't.
That's why that's why when you see his name up on the, the list, he, he won't sell.
But he finds out all these things but he doesn't tell you and you keep getting killed and you think I wonder if I could do it
Mm.
and until you see him doing it  ooh I said you never told me that did you?
And he  oh that's, that's a free life for them, you punch it and it's the ghost that kills him, you can't get away from the ghost.


Can if you run like hell.
He was only saying to me 
Yeah but 
last night  and it put me right up er  it put me right up  
Where you've gotta get underneath them.
and I said there's not enough room to run.
That's when I switch it off.
I tell him I can have the red ball if he  straight into  right and keep pushing your finger on it and er he'll go under.
It says in the book see erm to pr 
 
press the down button and then across  so that's the down button, you know 
Well I thought you had to get a certain amount 
Er well in the book it doesn't say it and I tried it and under the  give that a little bit more room,can get back under by just moving 
What have you got to eat then?
Go and have a look then.
