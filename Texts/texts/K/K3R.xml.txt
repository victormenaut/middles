Health danger that may lurk in lakes
DANGER might be lurking in freshwater lakes as the country basked in sweltering temperatures, scientists warned yesterday.
The scientists said anyone who decided to take a dip to cool off might end up with a nasty stomach upset, eye and skin problems or, worse still, hepatitis.
The problems could be caused by microscopic organisms called blue-green algae, found in open stretches of fresh water, where they float as ‘blooms’ or gather in brightly-coloured scums on the surface.
The hazards were reported yesterday in medical journal The Lancet following a study by the UK Medical Research Council.
Poisoning incidents have been registered as far back as 1842.
Dogs and sheep have died after drinking near blooms, where the toxins tend to concentrate.
But you don't have to swallow the water to become ill.
Eating fish from infected water is hazardous.
