Charles Pollard, chief constable for the Thames Valley says court proceedings have become like a game.
He launched his attack at a meeting of the force's police authority.
As one of the worst examples, he cited a recent case at Reading Crown Court where the prosecution decided to offer no evidence against three animal activists, rather than reveal sensitive police records.
The police claimed the records weren't relevant to the case, but the judge ruled they should be disclosed.
The three defendants were formally cleared by the judge, but then straight after the case they issued a statement admitting they had intended to remove animals from a vehicle and set fire to it.
Male speaker
Three people with incendiary devices were found in a car…they said they had been intending to commit a serious crime and they just walk out of court.
Court proceedings have become like a game.
It can't be right.
Voice over
Under the current rules of evidence, sensitive police information about intelligence gathering and informants has to be disclosed to the defence if the judge orders it.
The police say they can only do their job if that information's kept secret.
Male speaker
Courts at the moment are inclined to ask the police to give up information which is compromising our ability to tackle crime.
Voice over
Interviewer: So does that mean serious criminals are getting off the hook?
Male speaker
Yes definitely
Voice over
But civil liberties groups say the rights of defendants must be retained.
Male speaker
It's not for the police to determine what information is right for disclosure.
That's the judge's role and it's a role that the judge discharged in that particular case.

It's the second time in a week that officers from Thames Valley police have spoken out about what they see as abuse of the judicial system.
The earlier row was over a decision by magistrates in Aylesbury to let two offendors wipe out a thousand pounds in fines by spending a few hours in police cells.
Mr Pollard said he couldn't comment on specific sentencing decisions.
But, he wants the government to act on the recommendations of the Royal Commmission on criminal justice.
Only that, he says would ensure that such disputes over legal procedure were sorted out before a case ever went to trial.
Tories in Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's constituency have given nothing to Conservative party funds over the past year.

Witney constinuency is one of the safest Conservative seats.
More than thirty six thousand voters backed Douglas Hurd.
But over the past year the Conservative Association's contrubtion to party coffers was precisely nothing.
He says it is embarrassing.
But they inherited large debts.
And some Witney voters are puzzled.
She says she can't understand why they're contributing nothing.
He says there are plenty of rich people in the area.
An explanation can be found in the Association accounts.
A few years ago there were huge unsecured debts…around of thirty thousand pounds.
Even the Association headquarters was worth less than its mortgage.
He agrees that the Conservative party preaches financial prudence and this isn't the kind of thing it should doing.
And this year the association has tried to make a clean break from the past.
An item listed as extraordinary effectively writes out of the accounts a twenty three thousand pound loan…given to this man to help buy a house.
Victor (BERJ) Burge was the constituency agent…,. until he developed cancer.
He resigned from the Conservatives after they threatened legal action over the loan.
And even now he can't believe he's off the hook.
He says he hasn't seen this year's accounts.
The Association chairman says their finances are now in order, thanks to the generosity of Conservative supporters.
He says they'll soon be contributing to party funds.
And the financial record of Witney's Conservatives will no longer be an embarassment to the MP and Government Minister they're trying to support.

Riding the crest of a spectacular wave.
The Severn bore attracts dozens of surfers, canoeists and people who just want to watch.
Todays bore was high, helped along by freak autumn tides.
Dave Lawson, from Gloucester, holds the record for riding the wave non stop.
Today he has challengers.
Chris Griffiths, British surfing champion, is trying his luck.
The powerfull wave swamps six feet of riverbank — and our camera.
But the surfers love it.
Afterwards, a cold and wet Dave Lawson says his record is safe.
He says that if there had been a bit less water in the river the wave would have been bigger.
There's no record for Chris Griffiths — but he enjoyed it just the same.
He says that it was a great ride.
But it wasn't just the surfers who enjoyed the ride, the canoeists had a great day out too.
He says that he managed to stay on the crest of the wave.
He says it was brilliant.
There's another high bore tommorrow — when big weekend crowds are expected to line the banks to watch the surfing spectacular.

At Swindon Magistrates Court Andrew Broadway and Sandra Green admitted selling the discs illegally at car boot sales.
It was the first prosecution of its kind in Wiltshire.
Trading standards officers investigated the couple after complaints from a computer engineer who bought their products at a sale in Lyneham.
They discovered that the pair were also trading at a stall in Abingdon and by mail order.
More than five hundred discs were found at their homes, all of them illegal copies.
But the couple's solicitor Con Fernandez said the pair were just skittles waiting to be bowled over by the long arm of the law.
They knew little about computers and had bought the discs from another counterfeiter who's yet to be caught.
Broadway and Green were each sentenced to 80 hours community service.
Trading standards officer say the recent growth in car boot sales has provided a perfect outlet for the computer pirates.
But to secure a conviction they must show prove the culprits are professional dealers.
Even finding out who they are is often difficult.

In admissions to the court, Shaun Gooch accepted that he drove the Ford Escort which crashed into a bench at Akers Way in Swindon, killing 5 youngsters — Ian Lilley, Sheree Lear, Paula Barnes, Paul Carr and Belinda Brown.
Gooch, along with Anthony Gallagher, deny causing the deaths by reckless driving.
In a written statement, an 11 year old boy, who was sitting on the bench told of how the car came towards him.
He said’ I heard a screech.
I jumped.
I thought the car was going to hit me.’
Mary Becks was in her bedroom on Akers Way, when she saw the car going through the air and land in a hedge.
She saw the driver of the car being catapulted out onto his back.
She thought he was dead.
Another witness, Alexander McEwen saw the driver lying with his arms twisted around a rose bush.
He struck up a conversation, first asking his name.
Shaun; Shaun Lee was the reply.
He said he'd been to the pub and had 2 pints and that someone else was driving.
Crash investigator, David Bristow used tyre marks on the road and a reconstruction to calculate that Gooch's car had been travelling at up to 96 mph.
There'd been a slight brush with Gallaghers car which was going in excess of 40 mph.
A combination of excess speed and harsh steering caused the car to go out of control.
The trial continues on Monday.

Meanwhile good news in the clear up rate of robberies, about a third of those recorded in the Thames Valley are solved and that is higher than the national average.

Swindon's initiation into the premier league has been tough…on Saturday they went two down to Newcastle at the County Ground…
Lee Clark got the first…
Paul Bodin then went and missed a penalty and within minutes United had a second from a penalty at the other end…well that's what the referee said…but there was no question about Paul Allen's kick…
At half-time it looked bad for Town but they came bouncing back with two goals in a minute…
Martin Ling hit the first…the second showed Swindon at their best…the old class was showing as Andy Mutch made it 2 all…who's a clever boy…
In the first division Oxford United were looking good in the first half thanks to a goal from defender Anton Rogan…
In the second half everything changed…a man called Tony Philliskirk pulled on his shooting boots and blasted United to pieces…the first came after 59 minutes…
the second after 79 minutes…as the Oxford defence folded…
the third was a blockbuster…a rocket of a free kick…3-1 to Peterborough…manager Denis Smith could be making a few changes before long…
there was no joy either for Hereford up at Rochdale…
United went one down to a goal which up in Lancashire would be classed as an up and under…
Lancaster the scorer…
he was back with a second midway through the first half…and that was that…2-0…
Rochdale went to the top…
Hereford slipped nearer the bottom
All three are playing in the coca-cola cup this week…here's the line-up…
Oxford are also playing at Tranmere in the league next saturday…you can see highlights of the Swindon Town game on Central's midweek sports special…and no Hereford fan should be missing from Edgar Street on Wednesday with Vinny Jones and the Crazy Gang in town…finally Swindon have put last season's top scorer Craig Maskell up for sale…he wants first team football 
Now if there were pools coupons for rugby union Gloucester would be worth a fortune…amazingly for the second week running their match ended in a score draw…it was 12-12 against Newcastle Gosforth 
Voice over
Gloucester started as favourites to win this one…and in a game of penalties must have been kicking themselves for not doing better…
Newcastle went into a six nil lead thanks to two penalties from David Johnson…the cherry and whites pulled level thanks to two penalties from full-back Tim Smith…back at the other end two more kicks from Johnson took Newacstle into a half-time lead…
the most disappointing aspect of Gloucester's game was the lack of drive and power from the pack…they were rescued by the boot of Paul Beech…he made it 12 a piece…two games gone and still no tries for the cherry and whites
Finally we're off to Blenheim Palace for the International Horse Trials.
All the favourites…all the big names were there…
Ginny Leng…

A horse called Metronome and a rider called Pippa Nolan set the pace over the cross country course at Blenheim on Saturday…second after the dressage they pushed into the lead…a re-run of last year when Pippa went and lost it on the showjumping…this year the field was even tougher
Pippa Nolan says they're up against it all the time…lots of riders have young horses and they've all had good rounds…but it's a sport of ups and downs and this year she's had her fair share of downs
The big challenge came from everybody's favourite Ginny Leng…she was riding Welton Romance and after racing around the 28 fence course was just two penalty points down from the leader…less than once fault in the showjumping…
So everything was riding on the last day…
Leng was first to go…against the clock…it was a clear round…a perfect round which had the crowd cheering
The pressure was all on Pippa Nolan then…she couldn't afford to make one slip…one fence down would have lost it…her heart must have stopped when they rattled one but they kept their nerve and the lead to win Blenheim's International Horse Trials
The Liberal Democrat conference has been told that the party is on the verge of a breakthrough in the Central South region.

Welcome to the English riviera.
The heart of Paddy Ashdown's power base here in the west country.
There is no doubt that both Labour and the Conservatives are worried about the’ yellow peril’as they call the Liberal Democrats, who are advancing from the south west into Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Oxfordshire.
Their delegates may look the same as in the beard and sandal days of the Liberals, but in reality the party is now well organised and riding high in the polls but their true identity remains a mystery.
Peter asks’ Who are you?
What is a Lib Dem?.
He replies:’ we were formed from the old Liberal Prty and the SDP.
We stand for freedom of the individual.
I think that's still important.
Perhaps that's old fashioned but then I'm getting on in years.’
The charge of racism arose after the recent British National Party bye-election victory in East London.
It is a charge vehemently denied by Cheltenham MP Nigel Jones.
Male speaker
Racists are bigots who should not share our planet and there is no place for them in our party and no place for them in Britain

The party has tried to break the mould before, but delegates are convinced that this time its different.
A government in disarray, an unpopular opposition, they say, will let them in for a taste of real power.
But voters are fickle: no-one knows whether the Lib Dem tide is coming in or going out.

Professor Reg King has been working for twenty years on developing a foolproof bank cashpoint machine.
And his research at Cranfield University has finally paid off.
He reckons his voice activated machine is the answer.
Every individual produces a different voice pattern when he or she speaks.
And now Professor King has produced the computer software to recognize that voice pattern.
He's taken it a step further too…producing a microchip that carries the individual voice pattern.
When the chip is incorporated into a smart card and inserted into a mock up cash machine, the user only has to speak into a microphone to be recognized and given the cash.
If anyone else uses the card, their voice doesn't match and their request for cash is rejected:
The system has undergone exhaustive testing to ensure it can cope with changes in same persons voice:
Male speaker
We've had our noses blocked so that we pronounce phrases differently.

Our limited trials have shown very good sucess rates.
We want someone to back some more extensive trials to prove the real capabilities of our system.

Baby Victoria Reece was born blind and brain damaged at Hereford County Hospital.
She's now 18 months old…but she has the mental and physical age of a 6 month old child.
During her pregnancy, Julie Reece was infected by a parasitic disease called toxoplasmosis, which is carried by pets or in undercooked meat…
Although in adults it exhibits flu like symptoms, it can be disastrous if passed on to a baby.
Julie says she was never told about the risk of toxoplasmosis…and she's calling for all pregnant women to be screened for the infection:
Female speaker
Every woman who's pregnant should be offered a test to avoid this happening.

Hereford County Hospital says pregnant women are given booklets detailing the dangers of toxoplasmosis.

They'd been planning their own form of’ entertainment’using dangerous weapons like these.
The flares were thrown onto the pitch as the players were warming up.
Swindon Town and Oxford United fans have a long tradition of rivalry.
Police officers had spent several weeks scanning videos of their previous encounters to identify trouble makers.
And by eavesdropping talk on the terraces and in the pubs, they overheard plans for a pitch invasion like this one at the County Ground last year.

Most local derbys are hard bitten and bruising battles, but Town against United was a game of quality; a match of distinction.
Oxford; desperate to get even with Swindon, anxious to show their skills were on top for most of the first half.
They couldn't get the goal though.
Town put up the barricades and blocked everything.
This was the closest United came; the boot of Micky Hazard robbed them and saved Swindon.
Towards half-time, Town began to move; started to flow.
Player Manager, Glenn Hoddle, pushed his men on by joining in the attack.
While Brian Horton sat and watched his early hopes disappear.
The first goal went to Swindon.
It was made and well taken by Martin Ling.
His first of the season gave the Swindon fans a happy half-time.
9 minutes into the second half, United hit back.
It was no more than they deserved.
The chance nearly slipped away with Mickey Lewis' shot, but the corner sent Digby and his defence into chaos and Oxford skipper, Andy Melville managed to scramble the ball in.
The equaliser brought more boost to Town, than United and for the first time in the game, the Oxford goal was under pressure.
Swindon made it count too.
They made it 2-1 with a simple move.
Shawn Taylor getting his head onto the end of Hoddle's high ball.
That was the start of a Town charge.
United were wobbling; Hoddle was winding up for a big finish.
Swindon knew they needed another to kill Oxford off.
Maskell came close to being the executioner.
But with 6 minutes to go, United bounced back.
A real sparkler from David Penney gave the local derby a firework finish and the fairest result of all.

The flames spread quickly through the workshops of this scrap yard at Elmstone Hardwick near Cheltenham.
It had started when a mechanic was welding.
Staff tried to put the fire out themselves, but were soon driven back by the intense heat and thick smoke given off from burning tyres.
To add to the problems, gas welding cylinders were in danger of exploding and had to be carried out by firemen and placed in water.
For the yards owner, it was 25 years of work up in smoke.
He says that it's taken twenty years to build up the business, but they'll just have to start all over again.
In another fire, this time in Gloucester, streets were closed off when fire broke out in a storeroom of the old Co-op building.
Firemen originally thought that workmen who are refurbishing the building were trapped inside, but everyone was eventually accounted for.

The thieves rammed their way into a convenience store and two supermarkets in the Springbank, Bishops Cleeve and Charlton Kings areas of Cheltenham.
At two stores they managed to steal alcohol and cigarettes.
But in each instance the value of their haul amounted to less than a hundred pounds.
Police in the town are spending more and more of their time investigating ram-raiding.
They say the culprits may be using the proceeds to buy drugs.

Four men have appeared before Northampton Crown Court charged with the murder of Isadore Johnson.
The prosecution told the jury that on the day of Mr Johnston's death, he and his fiancee, Miss Gillyanne Aglin-Jarrett, were celebrating their engagement.
In order to liven their party up, she had gone to the United Social Club in Green Street to find more guests.
At the club were the four defendants in a group together.
They were acquaintances of Miss Jarret.
There had never been trouble between her and them and it's unlikely Mr Johnson knew them.
The jury was told that Mr Johnson was on the door when the four arrived at his party at about three am.
It's claimed an argument with one of the defendants, 21 year old Simon Williams developed over whether he had been invited.
The prosecution said at that stage there was a lot of shouting an people survged into the hallway causing Mr Johnson to be pushed to the foot of the stairs.
A number than went for him and it was then Mr Johnson brandished a kitchen knife.
Mr Jarrett said she saw the four defendants go for Mr Johnson, holding knives and stabbing at him uttering threat of drawing blood.It was a fatal single stab wound to the neck that caused his death.
He was last seen staggering out of the house into the street possiblity still being pursued by his assailants.
A pathologist's report claims he could have survived up to half an hour after the wound was inflicted.
His body was found in the back garden of a neighbour's house twelve hours after he'd left the party.
The four defendants all in their twenties and from Northampton, Patrick Johnson, Paul Edwards, Dean Clarke, and Simon Williams all deny murder.
The trial's expected to last ten days…

Two years ago, Gloucestershire county council considered a ban on fox hunting on its 9,000 acres of tenanted farms and open spaces — but the proposal was lost, and hunting continues.
This morning, when county councillors arrived to reconsider a ban, supporters of hunting outnumbered animal rights campaigners by at least 2 to 1.
Supporters of the campaign two years ago to ban hunting, believe this time they will win.
Any fox-hunting ban on council land will effect hunts like the Beaufort and Berkeley, which would be unable to cross 130 farms let to tenants.
Tickets had been issued to limit the audience for today's sub-committee debate, a larger audience than for what some councillors thought more important matters.
The proposed ban was eventually carried by 7 votes to 5, but hunt supporters believe they'll win the full vote next month.
A final decision, to ban or not to ban, will be taken by all 63 members of the county authority when the council next meets at the end of next month.

This is a sight you won't see next year.
Stubble-burning is banned from 1993.
It was popular with farmers because it's a quick efficient way of getting rid of excess straw and killing off harmful weeds.
But the down side, was scenes like this; smoke from burning fields drifting onto nearby roads and causing serious accidents.
4 years ago, the regulations on stubble-burning were tightened up considerably.
They included warning local air traffic control and having hundreds of gallons of water and pumps standing by in case of accident.
The immediate alternative to burning is to plough the straw back in, but that can be prohibitively expensive.
Other ideas include mixing straw with sewage to make compost, which is being tried out at sewage works near Oxford and using it to make paper, which it was widely used for until the 40s.
Now, the United State's Department of Agriculture has found a way to replace 30% of flour in cake mix with straw.

Floating above a Gloucestershire wheatfield is the very latest in agricultural technology.
Called the’ Helikite’, it's designed to frighten off peckish pigeons, rooks and crows that can wreak havoc to crops.
Bird damage costs farmers millions of pounds a year in lost production.
The helium filled balloon with a kite attached, sells at just under £40, and it could be the answer.
Certainly while we looked on, the pigeons were keeping a very wary distance.
The helikite was invented by crops adviser Sandy Alsopp.

Sheer torture.
This wasn't defeat, it was a drubbing.
A demolition job which former United star John Aldridge started with the first goal after just 12 minutes.
1-0 at half time wasn't so bad, especially with a second leg to come at the Manor.
If that's what United were thinking they couldn't have been more wrong.
Four goals in 25 minutes sent them crashing.
Pat Nevin lit the fuse by making it 2-0.
And new Manager, Denis Smith, must have exploded at the way his defenders dillied and dallied and never got to the ball on time.
Nevin made it 3.
Within minutes Aldridge was back with Number 4.
The true art of good football is making things look easy.
For Oxford it was hard — very hard.
Tranmere were on a roll and, to be fair, there are not many First Division sides that can stop them at their best.
No consolation either for Oxford as Niven completed his hat-trick with Number 5.
Near the end Joey Beauchamp relieved the pain with his second goal of the season.

Nick Pollard died from head injuries after being involved in a scuffle in the centre of Newent.
One of the people who went to his aid was his friend and fellow soccer player David Huggins.
He says he was bleeding.
There was no response from him.
David is concerned at the length of time he says it took for an ambulance to arrive.
He says that it seemed to take more than half an hour.
Newent ambulance station stopped providing nightime cover last March, so the ambulance which went to Mr Pollard's aid came from Cinderford, ten miles away.
But there was a complication.
He says that the police cancelled the ambulance once before re-calling it.
This added a couple of minutes to the time it took.
But even so, it was still there within 22 minutes or so.
In a statement, Gloucestershire Police say 'the reason why the ambulance was cancelled when the police first attended the incident is being investigated by a senior officer'.
It seems clear, however that the initial cancellation only added a short time to the eventual arrival of the ambulance.
Mr Huggins, a part-time fireman, feels that none of this would have happened if Newent's own night time ambulance service hadn't been cut.
He says they've proved this to be wrong.
By the time a Newent ambulanceman gets up, gets down to the garage, unlocks, etc, another ambulance could be on the scene.
Mr Huggins is not convinced.
He says that the case for re-starting Newent's night time ambulance service has been proved, albeit with tragic consequences.

Luckily she was the only person on the top deck at the time.
Each year, 700 vehicles smash into bridges.
But now there's a new type of warning system.
An infra-red light, the height of the bridge, is sent across the road and if it's breached, a sign flashes up to warn the driver.
It's being tested at Blackthorn railway bridge near Bicestesr, which has been hit four times in the past year.
It's hoped the new sign will save it from further damage.
But not everyone will be stopped by the signs.

It cost £90,000 to install just this one sign.

Wolves aren't beaten yet…and two goals is no great mountain to climb…if you've got the right boots on…
Luckily Wolves didn't last night…and Town keep Fraser Digby had springs in his as he pulled off the save of the game…
At the other end…
Steve White could have finished Wolves off for good if he'd scored but a 2-0 victory is just what the doctor ordered…
The biggest crowd of the season packed into Edgar Street last night…what a treat for them…
Wimbledon from the premiership were running out to do battle and they were very nearly beaten at their own game…
United gave everything they'd got…they matched the big boys in effort and endeavour…down a bit on speed and power but that's what you'd expect…
If Hereford had made more of their chances they could have hit the headlines
Wimbledon never looked that good…there were flashes from John Fashanu…
Alan Judge in goal dealt with those…
but Hans Segers at the other end had a busier first half as United piled forward…
they were caught out only once and it hurt…sub Andy Clarke ran onto a quickly taken free kick and that was that 1-0…
in the second half Wimbledon threatened to run away with it but Judge saw them off more than once and then United came good again with a late charge…
what is it about cup ties…why do teams lift themselves for the big game…why can't they play like this every week…if they did they; d be top of the league…
food for thought for Hereford who deserved at least a draw…they'd did themselves proud in a game which sent the fans home happy

A new fraud-proof credit card has begun trials in the region.
It LOOKS like an ordinary card, but has differences that are invisible to the naked eye.
The big banks hope it will be the answer to organised card crime, which is moving into the country in a big way.
NICK KEHOE/Northampton
BARRY FERGUS/Barclay's Bank
Millions of pounds are already lost each year because of stolen credit cards.
Most major banks have fraud departments to deal with the problem…but its the customer who ends up paying.
The banks write off the fraud within their accounts but our pricing has to take account of it, so ultimately its borne by the general public.
Now banks fear the problem is about to get even worse.
New hi-tech equipment means thieves no longer have to steal cards…they can make their own.Counterfeit cards are already a major problem in Hong Kong and the Far East.
Now they've started to appear over here.
The quality is so good they're often indistinguishable from the real thing.
Worlwide last year it was over $200 so it's big business and very well organised.It's undoubtedlty the Triads in the Far East and the Mafia in America.
Now Barclays are trying to beat the counterfeiters with a new Connect card.
It looks exactly like the existing version but has a wider magnetic tape.
This contains an invisible watermark…detectable only to electronic tills and cash dispensers.The company says it should be impossible to copy.
We've had it into the major research laboratories around the world who specialise in security.
They gave it a clean bill of health.
The card will be tried out in Northampton over the next six months and should go into full production in nineteen ninety five.

When Chris Kent lost his job as a shop assistant in Cirencester, the prospects looked grim for.
At twenty, he was too old for youth training schemes, but lacked experience for the type of job he wanted in book-keeping.
Then he was offered a place on the Work Trial scheme — a local garage offered to try him out for three weeks, without obligation, while the Employment Service continued to pay his benefit.
All went well and Chris was given the job.
Male speaker
The three weeks that I was in the scheme for — they trained me to see if I could do the job properly, they were able to see what I'd be like when I was doing the job.
Also for me, I was able to see the type of job I wanted to do.
Male speaker
We were able to throw no end of different tasks at him to see how he responded to those.
It gave us a chance to see what he was like as a person, because normally in an interview you've got thirty to forty-five minutes in which to make a decision about a person.That can be very difficult.

Kington in Herefordshire, hardly looks hi-tec.
Just a wellie-chuck from the Welsh border, the town has earned a living from the land for centuries.
That was fine when manpower was cheap and farming was labour intensive, when families worked in the fields man and boy.
But as agriculture modernised, machines took over and jobs died off.
Market towns are suffering as a result, but Kington is fighting back, by going hi-tec faster than any other community in Europe.
From today pupils at the school conduct French lessons on a video link with France, map makers can talk to every house in the town, designers can move to Kington and work from home.
The town is the first in Europe to become Connected — linked to a new super highway of information which is being built around the world.

A taste of tradition.
No chemicals; no additives; just British hops and British barley in a pint of pure local pride.
The secret of their success has been passed down through the Arkells generations.
Peter Arkell, has the same ideals and ambitions as his great grandfather, John Arkell, who, as a wealthy farmer, founded the brewery in 1843.
He saw the potential of the railway town of Swindon with its growing population of beer drinkers.

It was a question of having the will to do it.
You had to buy all the houses.
In those days they were small holdings.

At the same time as the Rolling Stones were topping the charts, Brian Jones was, according to the media, living the life of a stereotypical rock star; drinking too much, womanising and taking drugs.
Now, nearly 3 decades on, writer, Laura Jackson says that wasn't the true Brian Jones.
She's spent 6 years researching his life and she's now written a book which describes him as a talented, but essentially ordinary man.
Laura's research took her back to Brian's roots in Cheltenham.
To his humble beginnings in Up Hatherely and his school days.
Teachers say even then, Jones was a rebel.
But it was at school that Brian's musical talents flourished.
He went on to form one of the most successful rock bands in the world.
But the fame and fortune wasn't all fun.
It was in July 1969 that the shock news came of Brian Jones' death in a swimming pool.
So many people attended his funeral in Cheltenham, that the town was brought to a standstill.
Laura has investigated his death thoroughly, looking at the coroners report and police statements.
She's deeply suspicious of the circumstances.
After all her research, Laura says she's grown very close to Brian Jones.
For the thousands of fans still listening to Stones records today, it's enough to know Brian Jones' music.

It's showtime at the Manor Ground these days.
Fireworks and fun.
Oxford United are trying to bring the family back to football.
They've a revolutionary scoreboard for the fans and on the pitch soccer to set the sparks flying.
United lit the fuse for a quality cup tie by giving everything they had against the big boys from the premier league.
Villa were quicker and slicker; their manager, Ron Atkinson, reckoned his team should have scored 6 or more.
But in the first half the United defence took everything they had thrown at them.
There were a few jumping jacks in the goalmouth though, as Villa went for the kill.
United lived on a tightrope at times.
Garry Smart was the hero in this blockade as he headed the ball off the line.
Oxford manager Brian Horton had drawn up a few special plans for Villa one of them was this free kick which hit the post.
They never came to terms with the speed of Dalian Atkinson; neither did Dean Saunders.
He missed a few chances; reckoned he should have scored a hat-trick.
Win some; lose some was Deano's verdict.
Villa won it in the second half.
The first goal was scored by Paul McGrath after 52 minutes.
The expert view; United keeper, Paul Kee should have won the ball, punched it clear.
United gave as good as they got at times.
John Durnin had a sparkling game and deserved a strike.
Villa, though, knew the way to goal.
Their second goal from another scramble,; it was Shaun Teale's shot which bounced off Kee to make it 2-0.
I bet there was no sleep last night for United's young keeper.
Oxford gave Villa plenty to think about though; made them sweat, had them panicking near the end and big Ron Atkinson was on the touchline to martial things.
Nothing he could do about Oxford's goal.
United deserved this; a burst of speed from Dave Penney and a winning shot from Joey Beauchamp.
The second leg's in 2 weeks.
The show ain't over yet.
The show goes on for Swindon, that's for sure.
They gave Torquay 6 of the best in Devon last night.
Top scorer Craig Maskell whacked in the first.
That's 8 for him this season.
There was no stopping Town after that.
Dave Mitchell got the second and within seconds they were through again.
Martin Ling was the scorer this time.
3 more in the second half.
Defender, Shaun Taylor made it 4.
He's Town's top target man at corners and free kicks.
As for the Swindon fans, they loved being beside the seaside and Dave Mitchell answered their chant — We want 5 — with his second goal 9 minutes from time.

Streets became rivers as rivers burst their banks in Newport Pagnell.
It left householders mopping up after a surprise drenching.
The fire brigade had to bring in their rescue boat normally used on the Thames to ferry 60 stranded people while the local council issued sandbags to those still hoping to keep the water at bay.
Fire chiefs say they were pumping out thousands of gallons of water every minute in an attempt to keep levels down.
The problem's arisen because surface water hasn't been able to drain away.
The nearby River Great Ouse was higher than the level on the streets.
The authority says the region was hit by a belt of rain of tropical proportions and the river's at its highest in 10 years.
All sides will be watching the weather and the river carefully.
Meanwhile, Central's forecaster says it remains a wet out look.
In Newport Pagnell that means the sand-bagging and the clearing up continues.

He saw 2 cars in front of him and said one car, which was driven by Anthony Gallagher, had indicated left but pulled out in front of him.
He had to turn the wheel to avoid him, but his foot had got caught.
Gallagher's counsel, Nicholas Atkinson QC accused Gooch of lying.

He'd been disqualified for not having insurance and disqualified before that for drink driving.
He had convictions for dishonesty and using threatening words and behaviour.

The Health Secretary was officially opening the Abbey Centre in Abingdon when one of the trainees tackled her on the issue of pay.
Paul Ritchie was upset with a County Council decision to withdraw pay for trainees at the centre.
He wanted Mrs Bottomley to pass his concerns on to the Prime Minister.
After Mrs Bottomley had promised to take the matter up with John Major she was able to unveil a plaque to mark the opening.
Later she met other trainees.
Some of them presented her with gifts that had been made in the centre's workshops.
The centre, which cost nearly £1.5 million to build, offers people with learning difficulties the chance to learn skills which can help them prepare for an independent life in the community.
The centre is the realisation of a dream for the parents of many of the trainees.
They led a campaign for the new centre to be built and today, Virginia Bottomley's visit turned out to be the icing on the cake.

Summing up the case against 24 year old Shaun Gooch and 22 year old Anthony Gallagher the Prosecution at Gloucester Crown Court suggested to the jury that there was sufficient evidence to prove that on September 13th last year, they'd been racing their cars along Akers Way in Swindon.
The Prosecution claim that on that night Gooch tried to overtake Gallagher.
It said that despite being aware of Gooch coming up at high speed behind him, Gallagher pulled out into his path.
The cars clipped and Gooch's Escort went out of control, careering into a group of young people.
The Prosecution told the jury the case against Gooch was clear.
It said he was driving dangerously and it was his car that hit the group.
Of Gallagher, it said that by pulling into Gooch's path he caused Gooch's car to swerve and so contributed to the deaths of the 5. 2 children and 3 teenagers were killed.
Shaun Gooch and Anthony Gallagher have both denied the charges.

From the Chief Constable…to the bobby on the beat…the men and women responsible for policing Swindon fear their jobs are about to change out of all recognition.
A committee chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy has drawn up a list of proposals for the Home Secretary which, if implemented, would affect almost every aspect of police life, from pay and conditions to career prospects and pensions.
The prime motive, the committee claims, is to save taxpayers' money, but Wiltshire's senior police officer says any attempt to run his force along purely business lines is doomed to failure.
But Sir Paul Fox, the former Managing Director of the BBC, and a prominent member of the Sheehy Committee, says the police are ripe for reform.
Chief Inspector Martin Meeks has particular cause for concern.
His rank's one of several earmarked by Sheehy for abolition.
Unless he's promoted to Superintendent, he'll face demotion, the sack or early retirement.
Sir Paul sympathises with Mr Meeks…but says it's inevitable that heads will roll.
Streamlining the rank structure is just one of the proposals Sheehy makes.
Others include relating pay to performance…and the introduction of fixed term contracts.
Among the committee's main concerns is the growing cost of police perks and salaries.
Martin Meeks has seen his income rise sharply since the '70s.
In 1979, the maximum a Chief Inspector could earn was 8 000 pounds.
Now he can expect to make more than 29 000 — even with inflation, an increase of more than 40 per cent.
On top, he's given a 3 500 housing allowance, and can look forward to a pension of up to 19 500 pounds a year.
Walter Girven admits salaries are high, but warns that the quality of policing would suffer if they weren't.
Sir Paul Fox isn't convinced.
Meanwhile, Martin Meeks is considering leaving the force if the Sheehy reforms go through.
It's not too late to make your views on Sheehy known.
The public consultation period ends on Thursday.
What becomes of the proposals then is up to the Home Secretary, and ultimately to Parliament.
Chief Inspector Meeks for one, will be anxiously awaiting the outcome.
His future depends on it.

She became Britain's first woman in space in 1991, when she took part in a joint soviet, British space flight.
Now she's opening a new science block as part of a two million pound development at Barnwood Park School in Gloucester.
Helen says it's good to see a girls school putting so much emphasis on science.
She says that science is still not regarded as a safe subject — it makes her sad.
Science teachers at the school say that unfortulately science is still perceived as being a man's world.
She says that girls think that science is for boys.
She wants to change that.
Helen gave a talk about her work, but there was one subject about life in a space capsule which everyone seemed curious about, and which Helen duly explained:
It seems the subject of space toilets was fascinating to them all.
But all were agreed that her insight into what it's like to work in space was fascinating.
She says that Helen explained how to drink water through a tube.
She says that Helen had to take 99 exams to qualify as an astronaut.
She says that if she went into schools and said she was going to talk abouty physics, kids would be bored.
But talking about space holds their interest.
Helen says she'd like to go back into space, if that doesn't happen she'll be happy to achieve at least one other mission: to encouraged more young people to take up science.

University Challenge started in 1962.
It ran 25 years, 39 weeks a year at peak time on Wednesday evenings just before Coronation Street.
University Challenge made a come-back of sorts recently in a one off celebrity special.
Dickie Goodlace from Northampton reading journalism was watching it.
It came to him in a flash.
He must start a campaign for this classic show to return to its rightful TV slot.
Male speaker
University Challenge was unique in its content because of its simplicity and of course its omniscient host Bamber Gascoigne who made it unique.

Male speaker
Whether this one could get back on the screen, I don't know.

It's all the idea of of school cook Annette Dodd.
Annette says she wanted to encourage the boys to have a try at something different.
They might be surprised and find they like it.
Vegetarianism is of course nothing new…famous veggies have included Leonardo da Vinci, Wordsworth…
Gandhi…
Adolf Hitler even…and more recently Gary Glitter and Madonna.
And it's becomingly increasingly common.
Jane Porteous, Community Dietitian, says more young people are becoming vegetarian but it's important whatever you eat to have a well balanced diet.
At St Birinus, the list of vegetarain options includes vegetable bake…pasta…mushroom crepes…pizza…vegge burger…and more.
It seems to be going down a treat.
The first boy says he's never had vegge burgers before and thought it would be a good idea to try them.
The second says he thinks it's a good advertisement for healthy eating.
The last boy says he's not impressed because he doesn't like vegetables.
The staff too have given the idea a gold star.
They both say it's an excellent idea.
So two satisfied customers then…vegetarianism at this school looks set to be the dish of the day for more than just National Vegetarian Week.

Two van loads of illegal hard core pornography the spoils of seven raids on sex shops in Northampton and all of it to be incinerated.
The sex bonfire was the latest step in a year long clampdown by Northamptonshire Police on unlawful pornagraphic publications.
With more than a thousand videos at up to fifty pounds each and many more magazines fetching anything up to thirty pounds apiece this is the biggest haul ever for the Northants force.
Police hope that by clearing porn shop shelves of the illegal material dealers will be forced to either sell legitimate publications or go bust.

The jury also had to consider the accuracy of a reconstruction of events prior to the accident.
The prosecution had already conceded it couldn't be safely relied upon.
He said speeding itself was not necessarily reckless and in the agony of the moment Gooch may have over-reacted.
And Gooch would never get out of his mind that the car he drove was an instrument of death.
Nicholas Atkinson QC, for Gallagher said the cases of the two men had to be considered quite separately, not contaminated by each other.
The impression that the men were close friends had evaporated he said.
There was no race and this case was no game.

It was for the juy to tie up the loose ends, unemotionally.
