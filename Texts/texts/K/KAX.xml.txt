On the death of my mother at Midsummer
June in the north is a convocation
of life: a barely dipping sun,
a shower of birdsong
and a suddenness of flowers.
My mother's room is still: she turns her eyes
at the call of raingeese: out of decay
the blue bird-brightness of her gaze
holds summer's tincture.
Time's at a standstill now: for years
she's chased and bullied it, imposed on it,
filled it to the brim.
But now the pendulum is set
to pause at every turn.
She turns her eyes again, following
the birds' flightpath.
Momentarily
they lift her world beyond its withering perimeter.
I sit prepared, yet unprepared:
it is momentous, this threat of separation:
alternately focusing
and then eliminating thought.
Unfinished conversations hover: words
have an all or nothingness
about them: we lapse into a silent vocabulary
of eye and hand,
a collusion of smiles.
I watch her breath flicker
ever more feebly,
until at last the moment comes
unhurried
unremarkable: one final sip of June
then quietness.
Suddenly the raingeese call
wildly as they pass,
but no eyes turn.
Life falls in pleasant places
(Pan Am Flight 103, December 1988)
Life falls in pleasant places:
five unwarned miles
above the green and sheepfold slopes
a fragile tether cut
in one long hellish trice of severing.
The Christmas lights have gone from Lockerbie,
frail in a fireball,
and neighbours' greetings
doused in an infernal uttering.
For Lockerbie
no gold or frankincense
but only myrrh,
and a Christmas star
exploding
and the ungivenness of gifts.
Breaking the journey
I bundle up my love
and all its gladnesses,
shouldering the great lightness
through strange and unfamiliar lands.
Only with you am I the gypsy:
glad to unpack it all, such as it is,
to let it spill in all its silly wonder,
its seeming worthlessness.
And you unwrap it
with your gentle unsurprise:
in your hands it's full of brightness,
and value
and strange freedom.
But I must pack it up again,
and hurry on towards no destination,
content to break the journey
briefly.
Gyaain tae da eela
Vaila darkenin fae aest ta wast,
wind faa'n awa;
eela nichts i da simmer dim.
Abune da tide, lik a sel, wir boat wid lie;
we hed ta tize her doon,
bulderin an traan ower da ebb
but nyiff i da sea.
Rowin oot bi wir kent wirld
tae da uncan moo o da Wastern Soond,
holms lay black on a sea an sky o gowld.
We'd row til da holm o Burrastow cam clos
dan drap da dorro;
een o wis wid aandoo, boos tae da wind.
Waands ower da starn,
piltocks nyggin:
up dey'd come wi a bummel,
sheenin, spriklin,
dan prammed an pechin at wir fit.
Lines unreffled
ower da side again
roond an roond da skerry
waatchin fur froad braakin on da baas.
Gled een, quick haands;
piltocks taaskin
bucket fillin
ee mair time
maybe twa.
Dan aathin quiet an da humin closin in.
Packin up wir proile, we'd mak fur hom,
blyde o kent lichts.
We'd row
peerie wyes, owsin as we god.
Abune wis, tirricks flitin
an a mird o maas, laavin an divin,
plotin fur muggies.
We'd tak da boat in on a flowin tide,
dicht an shoard her, dan rin hom prood
i da darkenin wi a fraacht o fish.
We'd aet wir supper
tae tales o uncan Oddysseys
in idder voes.
Thule revisited
In late simmer dey cam: we'd hear
der muffled throb: da Norske boats
makkin fur laand.
An dan we'd see dem, far oot bi Linga,
plooin da voe wi a frush a froad
an maas divin.
Tae men dat fished da Foula shaalds, a voe
an hooses strung alang da banks
wis maistlins hame.
We'd sprit tae beat dem tae da pier, watch
is dey aeged in peerie wyes, wan bi wan
muvin ta rest.
Der boats wir gowld an white, neebin lik dunters
i da jap, nay sicht o varg, aa thin tuckit in
an trig.
A line o bairns, we'd luk, an dey wid smile:
dey hed da very cast o wir faiders,
uncles, bridders.
We couldna spaek tae dem, but lifted wirds
wrocht fae common treeds: we'd rin hom
wi a skurtfu o soonds.
We'd wave is dey daandered tae da shop, skoit
is dey stunkit back wi a hail o sweeties
fur der bairns.
Sometimes dey'd cum alang aboot da nicht
wi a piece o shark: man wid spread da maet,
faider a map.
An shaw dem names der forebears hed gien ta every gyo
every broo an croft: he'd shaw dem Brunnatwatt
an Leravoe.
And dey'd see kent names lik Kurkigarth an Gronivoe
Trolligarth, Stapness, Pointataing, Stove
an Dale.
An we wid watch an winder if da bairns o lang ago
wid a rin ta hoid, whin dey sa da soondless Norskes

Paet wark
Voar wark dune, tochts turned tae da hill,
tae a hairst o winter paets ta cut an cure:
faider'd set oot wi tushkar an wi spade
ta rip an flae an cast a bank or twa.
Dellin doon, liftin fae da soolp,
tushkar fleein, paets wheefed up an owre;
ootburg spreadin, dark daek risin:
rings o movement an even lines o aert:
a dance, a vynd wrocht oot
in space an time
sin fire first lowed.
Licht lentenin days, sun high apo wir backs,
we'd burst apo da hill
liftin da larks:
raise da mossy paets laid oot apo da broo,
dan set apo da daek, blue brittle brak.
Banks raised, we'd loup clean owre
— peerie legs aye langer, jumpin farder —
spang owre skyumpies
platsh da greesy greff.
As simmer opened oot, da aert cam dry
an greffs wir raised.
We'd roong
an turn da half-dry paets, but aye fin time atween
ta tirl an headicraa, curse motts an mudjicks,
seek berries, shaste mooratoogs,
purl i da paety loch
an swittle taes.
Tae tak paets hame, a hidmost wrastle at da hill:
we'd rummel roogs, bag, borrow, fill kishies high
rinnin wi dem, kyempin, tae da rod;
hark an hear da tractor a dizzen times afore he cam
— aye late, a day's wark dune, a dizzen modoos maa'd —
an whit a styooch o hentin, firing,
ballin bags on tap, maakin da lod.
As mirknen creepit in
we'd clim on tap
an ride da cuggly lod
lik monarchs.
Hame wi da hirdin, black paets
sookit herd an dry: a glod
o winter warmth fae simmer's haand:
a varg, a strug, a spree:
a smile o simmer aert an sun an wind an rowed up
ta hap da caald.

1 Corinthians 13 — Faith, Hope and Love
We can sye trow aa wir lear, but fin
hit nivver answers onythin wirtwhile:
fur every answer fun,
anidder dizzen mysteries unfaald.
Some tak a leap o faith
tae see a mind ahint it aa,
but faith hitsel is jost a coarn a sharg.
Hope keeps wis bassellin on
when life is lik ta ding wis sideywyes:
we had on in, an wadder aa life's dunts
wi hope, fooiver smaa.
But o da tree, faith, hope an love,
da midder o dem aa is love.
Sho redds up reffled hopes an steers
whit peerie coarns o faith we hae.
Sho kens wir wyes, but nivver ants,
nor akses muckle in return.
But foo love cam tae be, Gud kens:
der surely is a mind ahint it aa.
Edinburgh Volte-Face
City of seven hills
rivalling Rome: you are
the big sister of all cities,
forever tut-tutting.
City of venerable skylines;
each morning you un-do yourself
like someone more anxious to save the wrapping
than enjoy the gift.
City of open spaces: for you
no strollers in the forum; merely
a scurry of solicitors, vellum-faced
with long north-facing days,
and little women, worn
from cleaning other people's stairs.
City of the great estates;
you have no outer wall, but numerous apartheids
charitably maintained.
City of the seven hills
rivalling Rome: I hold your negative
to the light, and see
your true topography.
Spring Break
It is the nihilism I like
the almost lack of calendar
the near amnesia
of who and what I am;
no phone, no bearers
of busy tidings, good or bad;
everything on ‘hold’,
and in a room of no decisions
finding at last the slack tide
of sleep, in linen I shall not wash,
lying through depths of re-dreamed dreams
but no matter, dozing again, content
to judge time only by daylight
through thick curtains
gradual, sensing
a life-line spun out, pulled
through turbulence, now reeled in
slowly to renewal.
A Baby's Smile
Peerie ting
wi dy sprootin an flailin,
du gaffs an smiles
wi dy hale boady:
du could tresh coarn
wi yon legs o dine
an der wappin.
Dy face is a flaachter
an dy smile bides
as a glod o licht
fae a dippin sun.
Naethin at's god
could dave dis spunk
or trottle dy sang.
A Peerie Codicil
Dinna lay me wi uncan folk
ta lie a thoosand year
sabbin dagidder; da stane
heavy, marking oot a piece o laand
ithoot meanin.
Slock me whick an clean:
lat da ess birl whaar hit wil;
nae monimints.
A'm in dee,
an du's ma mindin.
A Little Codicil
Do not lay me between strangers
to lie a thousand years
co-mingling; the stone
heavy, making out a territory
without meaning.
Quench me quick and clean:
let the ashes fly lightly where they will;
no plaques.
I am in you:
you are my memorial.
Gyaain fur da mylk
Da shortest gaet ta Bardister
wis up da daal, makkin a trenkie
trow unma'an girse,
roond bi da lochside
an toons o Kurkigert;
on bi da paety hols
atween da lochs — but na owre near
fur fok said you wid laand ‘doon under’
if you weet your feet —
owre Vatnabrug, a muckle slab
across da burn, smoothed
troo centuries
bi trows an traivellers.
Hit wis Rubicon in simmer:
nae shunner crossed
dan tirrick squadroms scrambled
ta warn wis aff der nests.


We'd rin, pel flailin owre wir heads
ta hadd dem aff,
spangin stanks o yallow blugga
chasted bi da caald clos pirr o wings.
At last, da nae man's laand o Bardister,
an der retreat.
Warm whalps
wid rin ta meet wis:
a thoosand licks, an aa wir fear
a hameward baff
wis gien.
Annider simmer gaet wis owre da hill;
annider wirld: wild open heogan,
moss an hedder-kowes,
berries, sookies, drummie-bees:
sookies gae'd a snyrk
when pooed, an cam clean oot;
wan flooer, wan honeyed sook,
primeval gadderin —
Whaaps an peewits keepit watch;
dey nivver muv'd but passed
der warnin cries aroond.
Nests wir denkies i da grund
wi eggs or bruckit shalls.
At last, leg-weary, we'd cum apo
da hill-grind, twa hooses
an da riggs o Bardister.
Pels lined da porch,
some wi blaand or bleddick
sharp-smelled an snipperin;
fur wis, fresh mylk
still warm.
We'd mak fur hom, ped daddin,
unawar o fu a kirn o memory
wid turn sae lang
an still sustain.
