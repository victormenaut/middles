Oh!
Just see if it's speaking to me.
Sometimes it just won't work.
that nearly works and  stick that under there.
Hear it?
Mhm.
We hear it.
We're saying nothing.
Now you just have to tell me about that that  peedie er shop again Vera.
I don't know that it was actually a shop
Aha.
but I think it would in fact you'd maybe find records of it in some of the old Orkney boats.
Yeah.
I'm sure that's where he got it .
Aha.
And er it's it was just a I think a sort of supply of stuff was kept at certain houses.
Mhm.
So that folk maybe in the sort of parish didn't have to walk into the village to get it.
To get it.
Well 
And it well they certainly  seemed to be to do with it at the burying like the the linen
Yeah?
and then the bows for the 
Aha.
I suppose it would be when they well when they dressed  that was the night they had a big celebration wasn't it.
Aye that would be it.
Mm.
Was that that was that was the night  or
No.
Yes that would the night when the body was put in the coffin .
Coffin.
Aye.
Yes.
Right.
And a lot of the friends were asked to come  
To come  Aha.
Aha.
Because I've had  a look through all the books that there was and er there's never more than what .
Mhm.
Well you see 
So it's something nobody knows much about what  were like in Orkney .
but this actually came from  thinking about shops.
I see.
And and things that that were sold you know in different places and this 
Mhm.
small sort of shops that were well in Bremness and
Aha.
Mhm.
And they would sell maybe the cloth
Mhm.
and and the what else would they sell?
Well I don't know what else they had I think 
Ah.
it was just more or less They they certainly wouldn't have food or anything like that I think it was just more or less the supplier or  That would be 
Aha.
when relatives called you see.
Oh I see.
And so that the folk wouldn't have to trudge into the  to to buy their stuff  .
  
No but you certainly nobody no woman ever went  
 
when I was young.
Nobody.
And in fact women weren't 
Mm.
No.
seen at funerals.
Oh is that right?
Yeah 
the woman was never seen 
They went into the either the upstairs room or the kitchen or somewhere, the door was shut and that was them.
Oh I see so sort of on on the funeral day they they wouldn't even be in the house .
Oh no no 
No no  
And
and like when anybody died, your blinds were taken down.
Oh I see.
And maybe a relative or a near relative would do the same.
Mhm.
I can 
Yes.
mind being in in here with blinds down.
And always when a funeral come down the school road, there's blinds would be taken down as well.
As well as all 
Oh  
 
the folk in sc on the school road.
Shops everything took their blinds down.
A sign of respect I suppose was it not ?
Yes a sign of respect I suppose.
And what about bairns, would they keep them in?
Oh yes
Rather then
Oh yes and you didn't get to go to school.
I mean you were kept home.
Oh!
Oh is that right?
 
Yes.
You you stayed at home.
I see.
Oh and you would you would just get a day off for the for the funeral if it was a near relative to you.
Would it be?
Yes but usually you were off school right from the person died to the to to after the funeral .
 
How long would that be?
Maybe three days.
Three or four days.
Mhm.
Three of four days.
Mhm.
Mhm just  kind of 
Mhm.
And then there's black clothes was worn.
From top to toe.
Oh yes I've heard of it.
I've heard of it.
That was the one thing that was that I read in the books that it was kind of tradition for the men to wear black.
Mhm.
Oh but the women wore black too.
Yeah.
And if you I mean if you maybe couldn't afford to buy a new raincoat, you would have a big black diamond cut off a piece of cloth 
Oh I see.
and sewn on.
Oh
or an armband but it was usually a black diamond here that was worn.
Really?
Mhm.
Aye and the women would wear maybe grey.
Mhm.
After  or or a .
Mhm.
Mhm.
Aha and what about hats?
Would they have  
Oh well hats were worn.
or or would they 
The funeral day they wore bowler hats.
Oh really?
Oh yes, the men wore I can remember my father wearing a bowler hat 
 
Oh really?
Oh yes.
And some of them may maybe the old women had a cap on but it was usually bowler hats.
For heaven sakes, bowler hats.
That's just 
That's with stiff white collars and
Oh yes.
Mhm.
That's that would be a complete suit then really wouldn't it ?
 
And would it be just kept for funerals especially.
Oh well they usually had a dark suit  
Mhm.
usually in a dark navy or
Mhm so it would double as kind of a  suit 
Oh yes  
it they wouldn't have just special clothes for the funeral ?
No no.
No.
the bowler hat was special
Aha.
the bowler hat.
Aha.
Yes I can imagine that would that would be special.
It wo must have been I mean that was if you  to get completely new clothes every time, that would have been an amazing expense wouldn't it .
Oh no  usually  dark clothes.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know.
Ah.
Well I suppose that's still a bit true.
Yes.
try and wear the dark clothes .
Oh yes yes.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mhm.
So would it would it almost be two parts to a funeral then?
A  and a a burial.
Was it the both both 
Oh yes  
Yes   they don't  now?
No but  
Sometimes.
Well well the undertaker 
Yes.
Oh no there's no  
no report filed in like  
 
Mm.
You see before there would be no women at the funeral so the women would maybe be
No.
you know they would come actually at that rather than funeral day .
Mhm.
Aha.
So what what was the ?
What you call a wake?
Would that be the same ?
Well yes, something the same.
Mhm.
Mhm.
So were folk actually invited to that before?
Really ?
Yes yes 
 
Cos that's something that's completely
Aha.
changes  and who were the invited?
I read somewhere there was something called bidding?
Just  
bids 
Near relations I suppose.
Aha.
Yes.
And some would maybe just arrive if they thought they should be there.
Oh I suppose so .
Yeah.
Mhm.
And would the minister be there too?
No.
No.
No.
That would
Not at the 
No no.
Aha.
That would just be the near relations then?
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
The undertaker 
And then they would all stay for tea or whatever.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mhm.
So who would arrange for the funeral then?
Would it be that head of the family? or the coffin maker ?
Oh yes usually.
Aha.
the undertaker .
Oh yes I mean 
He  maybe not
Oh I think so I think they just you just contact the undertaker and he 
Mhm.
he does everything else.
Yes.
He does the the main thing.
Cos I did hear on Sanday that erm it was a joiner that made the coffin.
And he was the joiner was the undertaker.
Well that's quite often the case.
Yes.
Aha.
Aha.
And Bill  that was here he was the same.
He made the coffins.
Yes but they don't do it now
No no.
No.
Oh I see they don't so i No I suppose they're bought  
But it's still the joiner that's the undertaker.
Yeah.
Yes that's right.
Yeah.
And it was er no it was a lady on Sanday, her dad had been the joiner there and she said that erm he acted as the funeral arranger as well.
Aye 
He did so he actually organized the funeral.
But I 
Mhm.
thought that w couldn't have been normal.
I was sure that it was usually the head of the family that organized that.
Well I don't know.
Well But it was sto er I mean to say they told er the undertaker who they wanted.
I see.
At one time they'd say, Oh just bid the whole parish.
Aha.
And they'd be written cards put put out to everybody.
Oh I see not a funeral notice ?
Yeah.
Oh no no.
No No.
funeral notice 
Oh I s Oh really.
That's that's  
 
Oh I see.
Aha.
I think  the first time I remember that I thought, Lord that just looked like a dance advertised through the window .
Yeah it does.
Yeah.
That was .
Mhm.
So I so there'd there'd be there'd be written to and would it be special paper ?
Well  were posted.
Mhm.
You know  like there was always a boy that er went round the village
Mhm.
and just had the card with him.
Oh I see.
And he had to be dressed in his Sunday best when he went round .
I see.
And he just knocked on the door and you just came and you read the card and that was it.
I mean you didn't get the card, he just had the one card  
I see.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Stewart  doing that 
So this official card would be passed round.
Mhm.
so that's not so many years ago.
No.
Really is that right.
I never n that's changed.
And would this card be a a special black card or 
Oh yes.
It was just a ordinary
Aha just a aha
black edge on it.
Yes
A black edge.
Mhm.
And you  the wee envelopes that came in with the black edging on them.
Oh yes.
Mhm.
Aha.
I see and and the boy that would be sent round would he be one of the family or related to any  
No no he would just be  It would just be the undertaker would usually have somebody that did that.
Mhm.
Oh I see so 
Mhm.
this was something they would 
Mhm.
arrange.
Aha.
I see, I didn't realize funeral notices were that new.
I just thought  
Ah well it's a good few years for this.
Well  Stewart still did it.
Mhm.
But he would be  the last of them in  that did it.
Mhm.
Mhm.
So was there a chap in  that made coffins then?
Oh yes.
At one time yes.
Oh yes.
Aha.
And 
 
Bill 
And 
Mhm.
And sis he do it for the whole of the island or just the  was did the sort of parish have their own chap ?
Oh no the whole whole lot.
 
Mhm.
I see.
Whole island.
Mhm.
.
Oh yes.
Oh there's two.
Aye there's two.
There's always two of everything.
And what did they look like?
Were they cos I read this wife in Sanday said that her dad covered the coffins in black material.
So that you didn't 
Aha so they did.
see the wood.
Mhm.
Yeah that was right.
And I mind er  mother the first time  
Yeah.
it was  material.
 Mosh?
.
.
And er I thought it was so bonny besides the  black.
Yeah.
Mhm.
So they were  mauve mauve covered here.
Mhm.
And would would erm the joiner do that himself then, he would do everything ?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
And cover it was well?
Mhm.
Mhm.
And then once I suppose he wouldn't make it in the house would he he would have it made and brought to the house .
No no he would  
Aha.
Aha.
Mhm, yeah.
And then there would be the  and then and while it would be while the f the coffin was in the house that it was  was it?
Aye that's right.
Oh yes  I mean the wh the funeral day, you would keep the blinds down that day too.
Mhm.
Yeah.
So so it would about four days.
the next day they  you went to nothing.
Mhm.
You didn't go to dances or anything like that.
Yeah.
And what about after the funeral day?
Did it relax more then 
Oh yes.
or was there a sort of spell afterwards too .
Oh yes there would be you'd  a year you would be supposed to be  not very much .
Oh heaven's Oh right.
Oh yes,you wouldn't be supposed to go to a dance or corn  or anything like that .
Oh no.
No.
For about a year?
Aha.
By that time somebody else had died  
So you were  
you wouldn't get .
So you were in in mourning just like the  whole time .
I can remember you wearing black forever.
Black slippers, black stockings black  ,
 
black hat.
And mother died and then father j well mother died in nineteen forty and father died in nineteen forty one.
And I can't mind  what er what dates..
Mhm.
I can't mind  the dates.
But it'll 
was this the time you had your black edged writing paper and black edged envelopes and  
No well I never  that far but that was done and some would have the broad black  
Mhm.
Mhm.
letters would come from  in this broad black  
Oh is that right?
Mhm.
Mhm just to mark
You never see that now.
Oh no.
No.
No that's that's completely gone by the by yeah, yeah.
Folk seem to I don't know have a different attitude completely .
invitations to funerals lying somewhere.
used to get them sent
Aye  
Yeah.
somebody had one that
Mhm.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mhm.
What about the service?
Would that take place in a church then or in the home ?
No in the house.
In the house.
Aye the home .
Yeah.
And and 
it was always the home.
Mhm and that would be the time then that the women would go upstairs or into the kitchen or 
Aye  
 
Aha.
Mhm.
funny mind, we were just speaking about funerals not that long ago and you were just saying like er you remember the , when he died,
 
 
Oh yes aha.
Mhm.
And I mean there was they walked to .
Mhm.
it was a long trudge.
That is a long trudge.
Aha.
Going from  
And then it would just be well it would be a horse ca hearse then .
Aye yes.
Yes it was a horse  
Yes it would be pulled by horses.
Mhm.
Heaven sakes 
And mother was the last that was in that hearse.
Was that right?
Mhm nineteen forty, I don't think  ever  after that.
Aha.
Is that right.
Mm.
Yeah.
Aha.
that field there.
James  's?
Aye  stood there and mind one halloween, the boys took it and set it in front of 's door.
Aha.
Is that right?
Yes.
.
they must have
Oh
destroyed it .
 
Mhm.
Probably right enough.
So would the coffin be carried out of the house then, into the hearse.
Mhm.
And that would be the ma well that would be the like the closest
Yes.
be like the bearers would do that  ?
Aha.
Aha.
Do you ever mind them walking, carrying the coffin  to the graveyard.
Cos on a couple of islands 
 
the walked with the coffin.
Yeah that that used to be I've seen on film I've seen that you know like in Stornoway and places like that they carried the coffins 
I suppose.
Aha.
I suppose that's where they had no roads maybe or no hearse or something .
No no.
No.
There would always be a a hearse.
Oh yes.
Was that a special cart then?
Oh yes.
Mhm.
Mhm 
Aha.
Special.
Just just used for
It was c it was covered.
Wasn't it, the hearse was covered in?
Yes it was just a 
Mhm.
black coach you know with glass 
Something like a coach.
Oh I see.
Mhm.
Yes just like a coach.
Mhm.
Driven with horse driven.
Mhm.
Mhm.
And would the undertaker drive it?
No.
It was always a
Well it was somebody who could work horses I suppose .
Somebody well it was Magnus Bruce that used to drive it.
Cos well I 
Ah.
Magnus Bruce.
don't know why.
I don't know  but he used to drive it.
That would be Robert  's grandfather.
Oh heaven sakes yeah .
I think he I think he drove it.
Mhm.
Mhm.
So would this be just a a this hearse be just a black cart with glass and then a hood?
Be quite, nobody would fit in it?
Or did  
No no there's just  
 
Yes
Mhm.
Mhm.
I see.
Yeah.
Mhm.
And then it would be Then would the mean follow the hearse?
Yes yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
Right to the graveyard and then it would be 
Aha.
It was a long day you know.
Yes it would be.
some of them forgot to come back at night.
They used to .
Oh I see.
Mhm.
Consolers.
Yes.
And what times would funerals normally be?
In an afternoon?
I don't know.
Twelve o'clock usually .
Twelve o'clock?
Yes.
Twelve o'clock used to be a great well as far as I can remember.
Mhm.
It was twelve o'clock the funeral was a usually at.
I see .
And now it's usually two.
Aha.
That's right it's moved to the afternoon.
well  twelve before they walked the distance and got back again.
Aha.
That's well that's right.
They'd be following the cart so it would be going slow wouldn't it.
Yes.
Aha.
Mhm.
And er the minister would be at the house?
Or would have to would he ?
   
Was the minister at the house?
Whether he had to walk or whether  I don't know.
But he would be at the house anyway wouldn't he ?
Oh sure.
Yeah.
Aha.
And old Mr  our minister he he used to by pony and trap.
Aha.
But I remember  he never had a trap or anything.
 
Mhm.
Mhm.
Yeah so he wouldn't have a tra And then they would So it would start I suppose folk would start arriving at the house quite early in the morning .
Oh I would think so.
Mhm .
 
And then they'd have the funeral at twelve and then they would walk.
Mhm.
Right.
And then was did they come back for tea at the house?
No no that wasn't done then.
I see.
That's is that a new thing then?
Yes.
Er
Mhm.
I don't remember anybody coming back here
Mhm.
Not 
So the women weren't staying at home in the itched to make things for or to back or anything ?
Oh no there was nothing of the kind no.
Mhm.
I see.
And and  they wouldn't be in the procession either ?
Oh no no.
No no 
No no .
No.
Yes it'd be just be the men at the graveyard .
Mhm.
Cos in  apparently the women attended too.
But I've 
Yes.
Yeah But I've never 
 
Yeah.
attended as well.
Oh is that right?
that the women went there.
But
Mhm.
how long ago that was I don't know.
Mhm.
they certainly went there long before they did down here.
Mhm.
Mhm.
That's right.
I see.
And even still, there's not an awful lot of women go to funerals here .
No no.
You don't see it right enough.
Not really.
And then but it was seen as okay that the men could go to the pub after a funeral?
Oh yes.
Er that was
Mhm.
Aha.
Yeah.
Quite condoled.
Mhm.
So that's that's quite interesting too.
Cos I wondered if funerals would would wo have been seen as another sign of disrespect.
To have alcohol at it.
But it doesn't seem to have been .
Oh no no.
And the wake would that always be The  would that always be an evening thing?
Always an evening thing yes .
Yes.
Aha.
Aha.
Yeah.
Whereas the funerals was a whole day.
Aha.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well that's we've got quite a lot that's that's  brilliant .
you see none of that's written down because nobody 
No.
knows that.
No.
Er  nobody knows that.
Did they have wreaths in them days?
Oh that's the other thing I meant to ask 
it was home-made wreaths.
Home-made wreaths.
Yeah, the people, what did they make them out of?
Well evergreens.
Oh I see.
Oh I see.
Well if there was flowers in
Aha.
growing at that time, it would have flowers stuck in.
Aha.
But it was evergreens  I can mind mother making them.
Aha.
Oh really.
Oh yes, I can mind mother 
Would it be gorse and wire and
Well er just  wire and they just laid evergreens you know and one and just  them and  them and made a circle and a
Aha.
everyday  stuck them in.
Oh yes.
Mhm.
So would every family make a wreath if it was you know somebody c near them, they'd make their own .
Oh yes.
Yes it was Yes  make a wreath you know and send
Mhm.
.
Yes.
Oh heaven sakes cos that's that is a a new thing  plastic flowers.
Couldn't possibly have been there in the old days .
Oh  no no never saw any plastic flowers then.
No.
But when evergreens you know was bonny  white evergreen you know 
Yes.
Mhm.
and made a bonny wreath.
Mhm.
Aha.
 
white on it.
Yeah.
And just a small leaf on 
And just a small leaf 
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
I know they make wreaths just like you're meaning in Germany f at Easter.
Aha.
A woman I was staying with made a wreath like that 
Aha.
specially for Easter and it was just exactly like you said.
Aha.
Wire and she twisted them.
Twisted  
 
lay on and twist it and lay on you know.
Aha.
But it took her it used to take her quite a while I suppose it would take couple of hours to make a bonny wreath would it .
 
Mhm.
Yes it would
Well I can mind us making a wreath at school when Miriam  died, that was the only only body I ever remember dying when I was at school.
Mhm.
Yeah.
And we  eight maybe took meningitis and died
Mhm.
And I can remember we went and gathered violets.
Bunches and bunches of violets.
Mhm.
And  they were tiny and we tied them in wee bunches and it was Miss  who was the teacher then and she made a cross and put 
Oh how nice.
Ad we tied on these bunches on the cross.
Mhm.
And we went away up to  to gather the violets.
Heaven sakes.
Mhm.
Mhm.
It's just been such, it's obviously been a thing that affected the whole community  
Mhm.
Yes.
That's what It seems that you don't It seems to affect the immediate folk and not many other folks nowadays .
never wore anything but black from that day to the day she died .
Oh really?
Is that right?
Mhm.
Never had a colour on her again.
Heaven sakes.
No.
No that's erm quite
Mhm.
Cos nowadays if you if you did something like that folk would say you'd gone a bit funny.
Mhm.
 
They would say it's really affected you .
Mhm.
colour again.
Mhm.
Yeah that's just that's sad really.
Mhm.
Very sad.
Yes that that is interesting.
The other thing I was wondering is about the grave-diggers.  nowadays they're at the side of the grave ready aren't they.
Aha.
After funerals.
Was that so in the old days do you know?
Or d 
I've no idea about that what they did at the grave?
Yeah.
Cos you wouldn't be there you see  
No.
It wouldn't be wouldn't be done.
Mm.
Well I know they're not allowed  to dig down like what they used to do.
I mean before they went quite a depth down sometimes.
be two layer down.
Yes well you see they're not allowed to do that.
Oh!
Cos you see  and they could fall in.
Oh I see.
There'd just be one of them there.
But you see it's jut new regulations and a lot of the graveyards were on sandy ground and they'd be quite liable 
Mhm.
to cave in.
Yeah.
So this is the  that you're going over so much.
Otherwise they'd have had had 
Oh I see.
had this shored up.
Mhm.
always used to be sort of double depth down but they're not any longer.
That's true.
Mhm.
Cos that's right it was quite traditional to put folk
Mhm.
kin, husband and wife and maybe 
Mhm.
a bairn or something all in the one.
Mhm.
That's right, I mind that.
Well all this new the regulations are fairly new I think about 
Mhm.
Cos there wasn't a regulation afore about how deep they had to be.
No.
So or anything like that.
I mind that right enough.
Yeah.
Well that is very interesting, that's helped me a lot.
a bit for the for the archive.
Bits and pieces.
Bits and pieces.
See if this grave-digger knows any more.
I bet he won't know  much more than that .
I would think every community would have sort of customs of their own to a certain degree too wouldn't they.
Yeah.
Well this is that's what it says there too, it diff Doesn't it say there it's different
Yes.
in Orkney but nobody knows what was different .
Mhm.
Mhm.
Nobody knows what was normal and what was different.
But if it's true about the women going to funerals in , that's certainly different.
Yes.
That's right.
Aha and maybe in in .
That's that's certainly a a big big difference.
Mhm.
From what from what would be here.
Indeed.
But that about the shops I I never knew.
That you might have shops for
Mhm.
for that things but I suppose right enough.
That would be quite different.
listen if that worked.
