This girl this morning she threw a wobbly.
Well what happened?
I was doing something all I heard was the sound of this chair.
And then she 
And she threw a chair at someone?
I think she was going to try and throw it out of the window but she didn't have the strength.
What she threw, why would?
I suspect she's for the chop.
Mm.
What was she ?
She was .
And Phil, bless his heart.
Phil you know he's such a nice chap and anybody who's got any problems will go right to Phil.
Yes.
So she rushed out and then  the  came in and said can you go and have a chat to her.
She, she wants to speak to you.
Yeah.
To you dear?
No not to me, to Phil.
Oh.
But it was  to cap it all her temp started today  
Temps are used to it.
Believe me temps get used to it.
But it was 
I don't know what had happened.
Whether she had had a warning or what.
But the thing is it's an open plan office and if you're gonna give a girl a warning you don't do it  office do you?
No.
Not if you've got any sensitivity at all.
Did did did, did somebody do that then?
Well, we don't know what happened.
All we know  twenty past five she threw a wobbly and .
No she's a nice girl.
Was anybody talking to her?
Well yeah she was, I think she was at Derek  's desk .
Oh well I don't suppose I'll see her on Tuesday.
Oh you, you've got the day off?
I'm off till Tuesday now.
Isn't that nice?
And Steve  hates my guts.


He signed my form a month ago and, and so he said to me 
Are you going to  take us down then?
I can't.
Christmas shopping.
I've got Christmas shopping, I'm doing it tomorrow night.
I'm taking mummy.
. Steve  who signed my form  so he said to him Darinda's got tomorrow off remember?
And he looked at me and he said oh no you haven't.
Cos we're a bit overworked and understaffed.
Yeah.
He said oh dear that really puts us in the shit and I said er  well   I'm not.
And I said to Zoe for god's sake don't tell him I've got Monday off as well.
John, John  at work's got tomorrow off .
Oh has he?
So what did your man say?
I've put a vertebrae out.
It was still out when he did it.
Vertebrae?
He said it's  you know it's it's  it's not easily done but he's seen them quite a lot.
Ah!
Now what I put out is my discs.
Well he 
Vertebrae is bone and disc is the cartilage between.
He was worried that it was a disc.
And he  pretty sure it's not the disc.
vertebrae then?
What's the worst?
I don't know  disc I would think.
Well why, why do I, why does ?
that's your vertebrae.
That's just, that's just  that's just releasing.
Just releasing.
And obviously what he did to me 
I'm seeing 
Are you really?
gentle with me.
What time?
Six.

No it's alright.
What I'll do I'll leave at five fifteen.
Then I'll park my car where you said and I'll sit there till 
No.

I will be here at quarter to six.
Well I can get here for quarter to six if I leave work early but I don't want to put you out.
No no.
I'll be here at quarter to six  
Are you gonna see him again?
Maybe 
I don't know, I 
maybe you could combine the two that's what I was thinking.
Well no no.
I won't be able to see him then.
Oh.
I mean  at six thirty.
I  
I'll meet you at quarter to six.
. It's very quiet 
Well I don't fancy it much even with 
You're ?
Mm.
If for some reason I can't get here 
It's ironic really.
Yes .
Cos we're both trained in self defence then.
Between the two of us we could .
Yeah.
But er  but he said it's, while it it was classic thing.
I bent into the car, bent round and I .
And he said the twist  extended it more he said and then the weight.
He said and that can do it.
He said your muscles are 
Should do more exercises.
and to find the little place itself was ridiculous.
I'm going out in the middle of a field.
Literally out in the middle of a field.
Well they should have a notice up shouldn't they?
There is a little notice there on the  .
You don't see the notice till you're .
So do you want another glass of wine?
Nature's  nature's anaesthetic.

I'll have salad now.
No you haven't.
Do you want me to make you some salad?
I'll do it.
Why not just give me the stuff and I'll do it.

No way.
You're not gonna start slicing and chopping   
No problem.

A bottle?
Yeah he asked for a bottle of wine.
I don't know if he's  
A bottle of wine?
Yeah.
Not Jameson's or something?
No he's not, he doesn't really drink spirits.
He drinks wine .
Oh.
Well he drinks brandy I expect but you know he doesn't really drink spirits .
No he doesn't does he?
So if it was wine it would have to be something special.
Not just plonk.
Must straighten all the books up.
They sell nice wine in M and S usually.
Beg your pardon?
They sell nice wine in M and S.
They do don't they?
Don't fancy a  to M and S   do you?

No.
Well if all the lists  say .
Only one thing on the list.

It isn't difficult because  no cos they're two  small families.
And they're one small family.
Mm.
I've a feeling that  .
Hope I'm wrong.
Mm.
I hope you're wrong as well.
I haven't heard anything from Jenny.
I wrote to her.
And enclosed some interesting bits for her  magazine .
She didn't mention anything to you when she phoned you last week that she got a letter from me?
No.
I forgot that  I discovered that all our letters now are apt to be a day late.
I didn't know until the other day.
What because 
Because they come through Aldershot and they all have to go through the scanner.
They all have to go through a special scanner  
Bad news isn't it?
.
You know those white flowers have died.
The other chrysanths are fine but those white daisy things

Well I don't put the white flowers in with them.
Spoils my arrangement.

I'm reading.
Well I thought you were going to talk to me about Christmas presents.
I have spoken to you about Christmas presents.
I've told you about all I can tell you.
Why don't you.
Why don't you sit down and tell me what you want for Christmas.
I mean that would be useful.
Oh darling.
Tut.
Nothing I particularly want for Christmas.
Well you bought me the new vacuum cleaner.
Mm.
That kind of  thing which I don't think is any damn good at all.
Send it back.
I'm going to.
Waste of money.
How did you pay for it?
Barclaycard.
Good.
Well send that back then.
Ah  oh dear excuse me.
Oh Tilly was thrilled to bits with that little  plastic  that little plastic thing with 
Oh you've given it to her?
Yeah.
Arrived yesterday.
Mm.
Kept the box?
No.
Oh that's a shame.
I just picked it up and got rid of it.
It would have been wouldn't it?
I can always get good strong boxes from .
They're quite clean.
They've only 
Mm.
Or wrapped apples or something.
Did you want some sugar?
Yeah, I'll come out in a minute.
You sure?
Mhm.
I like Anne Robinson on this programme.
I think she's better than Jimmy Young.
Really?
Mm.
I can't stand Jimmy Young.
Anybody's got to be better than Jimmy Young.
Ah.
He ain't a bad fellow.
I don't know what to do about these then love.
About what?
These things.
Oh right.
I don't know.
I'm very sad.
I've decimated the  the arrangement.
Have you?
Absolutely.
Ha ha ha.
Look.
Over half of it.
There's only two in this one.
They had flower keeping stuff, you know the stuff you get in the packet?
Mm.
And they had half an aspirin, pinch of sugar.
Lost one.
Oh no  sugar in these ones.
That's alright.
Yeah you usually put sugar in those.
There.
Oh very sweet.
No it's .
I haven't put any sugar in.
Poor little Herbie he 
In yours.
he did look, he did look so sore.
Ah!
Poor
But what Mrs   had done, she'd restructured his insides.
what?
She'd had to use, muscle tissue had wasted away  where it had been stretched by the  double hernia
Yeah.
and  she also had to remove part of his bowel.
Mm.
Just clip it up wherever she could.
Fantastic surgery she's done.
Really?
She said if you're worried about him at all he mustn't strain.
Mm.
He mustn't strain himself at all.
She said 
Mm.
Poor little scrap.
And he was trying to get round to his rear end to lick.
Mm.
And of course where .
But she's done a fantastic job.
Mm.
Hello!
But I said to  well you know Dave and I will be in the rest of today if you do get worried.
Yeah.
check up is booked Monday at three o'clock .
Oh.
And I said well if you want to take him earlier.
But I have planned to  shopping 
Mm.
Well we were there for ten you see.
We had to wait and wait and wait.
Hello.
Hello.
All showered and managed to dry your own feet?
That's something.
Yeah I've I've got .
I I I lift my legs up to my  head.
Yes.
Wish I could do that!
He's practising for the  
Poor little Herbie he'd erm, he'd got a double
Hernia.
Hernia.
Mm.
They've taken away all the  gubbins This is Mrs  who looked after Debbie's cats.
Do you remember?
Taken away the grobbins?
Grobbins?
.
I don't know what  I don't know what it is.
Not even, not even I  
not grobbins no.
They've castrated him at the same time 
Oh.
otherwise they couldn't get at things properly.
He's better off without them anyway.
He's not a stud dog is he?
But he looked so little.
Looked so raw round his rear end.
But she, she's restructured his insides.
The muscle had wasted with the pressure of the double hernia.
The muscle had sort of disintegrated almost.
She's had to use what muscle she can to restructure his bowel.
She's a marvellous surgeon.
It's  of money  isn't it?
Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.
Oh oh!
Jesus!
Now that wouldn't be feasible in your case because .
So what we'd have to do is trade him in 
Ooh ah.
It's better my back.
It's in my lower back.
I think it's where it's been, been higher up I think it's more 
Being what?
Well I've been holding it to save it.
Yes.
That's why you should have aspirin to relax it.
Cos it helps it mend.
Ooh.
I feel as if I want to  it hurts and I feel as if I want to move it.
Yes.
He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can go out just like that.
But he did tell you to move?
Oh yes but very very gently.
He said tell it you're going to move.
Don't do anything sudden.
Tell it you're gonna move.
I like the way he puts it.
So the wrestling's out tonight is it?
Oh 
Ooh  ooh
Have to get with the  Rock.
Alright Rock?
Ooh Rocket  ooh.
Ooh ooh
Isn't it lovely?
Ah!
Ooh Rocket ooh
Do you like having your tummy scratched?
Ooh Rocket ooh
Yeah we got there for ten o'clock and we had to wait till they'd finished all the out-patients before they'd let the in-patients.
In Mrs  's surgery.
There were two doggies in their pens still  sparkers you know where they've had things
What'd do they do?
Do they keep the doggie under sedation whilst he's healing up?
How long has he been there?
Oh yes.
No, no Herbie's not under sedation.
How long was he in there?
Just over a night.
operation.
Oh he's had all that done?
Yeah.
Did the operation 
How does he feel in himself?
Well he was  he heard Audrey's voice in the waiting room 
Pretty bloody awful .
and he was whining .
She said it's alright Herbie I'm here and he  for a minute.
And I said he's gonna do damage if he's trying to get up at the door
Yeah.
the way a little Dachsie would you see?
Yeah.
So we talked to him but erm we didn't actually see Mrs  until about a quarter to eleven.
And she said you know, on no account must he strain.
Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in.
On his insides.
And she said there was so little muscle  left.
It had been so stretched and strained by .
But she had to do the best she could .
Peter will .
And of course Audrey's not too quick on her feet you see since she broke her hip.
So I was trying to  help Audrey and that and help Herbie.
So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in with her stiff leg.
And then get the rug across her .
She didn't turn a hair when   she said two hundred and ninety three pounds.
I suppose it's like anything.
You get an estimate for it.
Well it's cheaper than  I suppose.
Parts and labour  .
Parts and labour.
Eh?
Does it come with a three month guarantee?
Cheaper than princess  princess Margaret or .
No Mrs  said she was very lucky.
She'd been to three lectures .
One of the topmost veterinary surgeons in Europe.
Yeah.
And that's why Mrs  asked her to do it.
She'd actually seen it done.
Seen slides and been to lectures on it.
I don't know it must be wonderful to be able to mend .
To rebuild his rear end.
Hope he comes out of it.
Well as long as nothing breaks, nothing gets .
No, now way must he strain so she's, she's got some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner.
Quite a major operation.
He's been ever so bright.
Walking about quite well, he did turn to lick his  under his tail but his little tail was wagging.
And he was walking fine.
He even stopped and had a tinkle.
See they don't know it's to hurt.
No  no.
No I think I think animals are fantastic they way they put up with pain.
Because they can't tell you.
And after a major operation there he was wagging his tail and
You don't know the threshold of pain in animals do you?
Can't tell you.
Well no.
Very seldom you hear a dog or a  in pain.
Oh you do.
Oh  
What's the matter?
Odd.
What's odd?
I think it's getting better.
The muscle's gone
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Cup of herbal tea?
An aspirin?
Nothing I can do you for?
Oh you're  book's upstairs.
Do you want that?
.Is it actual pain then, or stiffness?
Or just that you're frightened to move?
Ache?
Oh a bad, bad ache.
General bad bad ache.
Well you could have just one aspirin.
I've had one upstairs.
I took one .
No that was ages ago dear.
It was half past seven this morning.
It wasn't!
When I came up.
It was late.
You were up getting dressed.
No.
I brought you a hot water bottle  your aspirin.
When I let the dog out.
Yeah but I didn't take it then.
You didn't take it then no .
You could have another one love.
It would relax your muscles.?
No it's probably gone.
Nature will usually tell you .
What I always found with  with lumbar aches was erm  putting the knee up sideways across your erm .
Hello Rocket.
How are you Rocket?
Hello Rocket.
Oh he's pushing hard isn't he?
Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh.

You'd look even funnier.
Oh I must do.
He likes his

How did you do it?
Climbed up the chair.
Climbed up the chair?
Mm.
And you  your side?
Yeah I climbed, I went, I came up properly.
Crawled .
Rolled over on your side.
Would you like a cushion?
No it's alright.
Do you want a hot water bottle?
No  it's okay.
Ooh that's .
Ooh it's

He just did.

He did?
Perhaps he used his wing mirror.
Like I do.
That's a quite nice little  place there.
And you don't pay over the odds prices because it's not an expensive place to  have your shop.
Oh.
That's good.
You go to these big stores and they pay so much in heating and lighting and staff .
This er pavement's quite nice  .
Isn't it attractively done?
Done like parquet.
Don't know who's paying for it all  whether  council is  or what?
So do you want to go over there first?
It's up to you.
What do you want to do?
I don't mind a bit.
Well we've got fifteen minutes, well thirteen minutes.

They're humbugs or something.
Oh right.
That's what you're supposed to be having as well, isn't it expensive .
Selenium?

It's down here somewhere I think.
Feverfew   just ridiculous.
Here it is.
Look.
Hold on.

Oops.

For thirty p.
Jesus incredible.
Isn't it?
That's good isn't it?
I suppose they're all alike but they've put different ones on the outside.
Well they must be similar.
Erm  casseroles.
They probably won't have any cos it's winter now.
They only sell casseroles and things in the summer.
Oh look.
There's one but it's not a, not a three pint.
Three or four pints she said.
Mm.
Is that Pyrex?
Well it's, it's the French equivalent.
Is it?
Mm.
 Arcal crystau d'arc yes.
I don't know.
Or  crystau d'arc whatever you like to call it.
No, she said  well she means an oven dish.
Still they're very nice.
I wish they'd got a bigger one.
What size are they then?
Two  one and a half to two pint I would think.
Oh they're not very big are they?
And  that's a water set.
Hello love!
Hello.
You haven't got any larger casserole dishes have you?
No .
You want the great big one 
Mm

That's the size up from that one.
Yeah.
That's what we want, yes.
Yeah.
But  haven't got one.
Oh you rotten thing.
Actually ask the girls and if they get them, go up the warehouse next week  they'll bring you one.

They're ever so popular.
We sell a lot of them.
One point five Q T it's got on there.
Quarts is it?
One point five?
Quarts?
One point five quarts.
What's that in English?
Well one quart is two pints.
And a half a quart is one pint.
Right.
That'd make it the three pints.
So you'd want the next one up wouldn't you?
That would be that one.
Well it's a three or four pints she's after.
It's probably a four  
It doesn't look big enough.
Are you sure it says one point five quarts?
Well it says it on there somewhere.
one point five quart.
Well.
Perhaps it's  perhaps they hold more than you think they do.
I don't know..
What do you think Dinda?
Should I take this one?
While 
Erm 
they've still got it.
It's the last one.
It's not chipped or anything is it?
No.
I've got my hands full and you've got your hands full.
Three pint.
See we might not get one more in before Christmas.
I'll ask Gill and Maureen
Mm.
take that but then if you, if you really don't think that will hold what you want then you'll have to bring it back.
It's a, it's a, it's a Christmas present .
Oh I see yeah.
Ah.
Three to four pints she said.
That looks  yeah looking at it
I think it  
It's quite capacious, actually.
Yeah.
I think
It's a nice dish.
Have you  we haven't got a measuring jug.
Haven't got any what?
That is right isn't it?
One pint is
Well a quart is two pints.
Yeah.
And point five of a quart is one pint.
That makes it three pints.
Why they can't put three pints on instead of one point five quarts .
But does she want a three to four one?
If she wants a three to four you gotta have the next size up.
Three stroke four
Well she said  three or four.
Oh I see.
so obviously she was easy about the size.
I think that would be ample cos usually there's only two of them 
There's only two of them, yes 
to eat anything you know 
yes, yes.
True.
Yeah I think we should grab it while we see it actually.
I think we should too.
It'll be half the price it is in Boot's Cookshop .
Do you want me  Do you want me to drop it or should you drop it?
I don't know.
Do you remember Jackie, he used to be
another one look.
Yes.
And that that one holds quite a lot
 
No.
No.
Do you remember Jackie?
He used to be dark haired and worked in the  toy shop in Sandhurst.
Yes I do.
Yeah I thought you would.
I knew the face.
Used to go in for your model paints and  coloured marbles
That's right, yeah.
There you go.
Long time, long time ago.
All those years I was there 
You haven't, haven't changed .
You haven't changed.
I mean your face I knew straight out.
It was your hair that got me.
Well the grey come through and I was just sort of I thought I can't wait all those years  with dark hair.
I had a friend who had long hair and she, she let it grow right the way through.
And for nearly seven years she looked like an old woman of eighty.
Yes.
And I thought I am not gonna have that.
Well that's right.
I agree with you.
So  I more or less had a crew cut.
Yes.
And er of course it's still grey now
Yes.
except like this bit here which er grows  
I know, oh yes it always grows a dark bit.
but that all took  I think, when you're older  when you go grey it's, it, you look softer and you get away with the grey coming through on white hair.
Yes.
That's right.
But on dark hair.
I mean for years when I was young I was jet black and that was lovely.
Yes.
That's right.
You were.
I never had to touch it or nothing.
But when you start going grey you look so
It's pepper and salt then.
And your skin changes.
I used to be right tanned skin.
And that, that even changes as you get older.
Yeah that's right.
Yes well I, I was very fair to start with.
Yeah.
And then it began to get a bit darker.
Not my eyelashes and eyebrows they're silver.
Always silver.
Absolutely silver.
Mine are  yeah, dark still.
But my, I thought no I'm not gonna go pepper and salt.
That's right yeah.
I don't mind going silver.
That's right.
This is natural silver on the temples.
That's right.
Yeah, like, look here you see look.
Yes, yes you've got a silver.
I mean I've got, I mean I don't mind this but  why shouldn't you do it?
And my friend she looked about eighty  
Yes I couldn't agree with you more 
but she still looks old for her age.
Yes.
My best friend was your colouring and she always has a  rinse.
It's her husband.
She said I don't mind going grey but, but Paddy objects because he says it makes him feel old.
Oh.
But the thing is 
He' my colouring.
also as well when you're black and you touch it up black when you're old you look hard.
Yes.
They usually say go paler.
yeah.
They usually say go to chestnut rather than keep to black.
Mm.
Actually I wish I'd gone like this years ago cos you get 
Yes.
you know much more fun than when you  
You reckon?
I don't know cos I've never been brunette, Jackie.
So I wouldn't know love.
Oh yeah, I think, I think it's because I  I had that severe hair style  I think, you know I looked hard.
Well I was severe.
I had a severe style.
That's right.
You always had yours  didn't you?
The neat pleat mm.
Yeah that's right yeah.
Mm the neat pleat.
But it was lovely for parties with a black velvet bow and  sequins down the back.
Oh yeah.
I loved it yeah.
Well when you go on holiday swimming.
Everyone was upstairs rolling up their hair
Yes.
and .
And you could swim, just dry it and then just pull it back.
big scarf and you were made weren't you?
Yes.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah it was very useful.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
We will go round this way or round that way?
Cor look at that bas oh no it's fine 
She ain't got that problem yet.
You wait till 
No.
She's probably saying oh this is so boring this conversation but when she gets to our age that'll be the same.
 
Well  well she'll just she'll just go silver.
She was silver when she was little so  I suppose she'll go back to silver.
Anything else you want to look at Dinda?
No I don't think so.
It's probably about quarter to 
Yes I expect it probably is.
Hello love.
We'll grab this casserole because  erm
Hopefully I won't 
what's her name wasn't sure if you'd get any more in of the next size up so
Right.
I thought better grab it while it's there.
Mm.
It's much, it holds much more than you'd think doesn't it?
Yeah, they hold quite, yeah they do these, don't they?
Yeah.
just put it in a bag for you.
seven pounds  
So's  so's people don't think we've nicked it.

Well you're supposed to use side A 
it won't tape it doesn't matter .
But it does to them, because they've got side A and side B on every tape.
Yeah.
And if they haven't got  side  side one tape two following  I mean side two side, tape two side A following tape one side B, it puts them out a bit I should think  are you going up the dog path?

They're just a person keeping an eye, I suppose they've got to respond to it you see and then they, they were, you know, they don't come and look .
The ranger's always bring their own dogs.

He's,, yeah.
and I think it's a friend of his.
Too true.
Yeah,.
But it just shows how, here, I said, how embarr there's no different to any other place where ever you go.
No, no  oh I agree people shouldn't let dogs foul on the pavement and in shopping places and things, cos it can be dangerous, but out in the woodlands if it wasn't for all the animals we wouldn't have any green stuff, trees and bushes seagulls are up .
No.
No, it's that , oh.
It seems, it seems calm enough doesn't it?
Probably .
Well we haven't got to go long for the shortest day.
No.
No.
About three weeks 
.
That's right, that's right.
It's the first tomorrow.
Yeah.
.
Yes.
That's it, that's right, that'll be alright.
Yeah I thought 
Get January over and we shall be alright.
Oh I don't know February can be horrible sometimes 
Yeah , have snow in February before haven't we?.
Yes , we had the, we had the six foot drop in February do you remember?were  cos we live on a steep hill and
Oh
it's great fun 
.
Getting up .
Everybody comes from miles around, all the kids come and the parents last year, was it last year?
Yeah.
it look just like a ski resort all the bright jackets and the woolly hats and it was lovely, I mean they made it into, into an absolute skating ring for driving on
Couldn't get your car up .
Which, every, every thing went sideways, but it was such fun
Mm.
and the sun was shining and everyone had got pla plastic bags, anything they could get to slide on you know
Oh yeah.
they were going down our front lawn then down the, then down then down the roadway, cos it's a dead end you see, so there's not much , not much traffic
oh I see, oh you're alright 
It's not, it's not when you get to the end of it  then there might be a couple of .
Yeah if you, if you're coming up you daren't stop the driver and there's things hurtling at ya, there's kids on sledges coming at you at about fifteen miles an hour and you'll have to try and drive around them and
I'll stick to the old  what they've got in California then.
Oh yeah, erm, oh I'd rather have our climate I think.
It get up over a hundred, people killed
Oh it's horrible isn't it?
it's a high death rate some .
Yeah, yeah.
Funny actually they couldn't, when the rescue people came they couldn't see where the damage was because of the dust.
Really!
Mm, it's, it's, it's on this mornings news
Oh .
This dust, this dust  in California.
I have heard, I have read about it .
This dust , and a, what's it a hundred and fifty cars all piled up on top of one another 
Oh shit.
and there's a lot of people isn't it, and they don't know how many's dead because there's so much dust they can't see.
Oh how awful.
.
Oh that's awful.
So.
I wouldn't like it that dry.
No.
It's the same as that place in Australia where they haven't seen rain for seventeen years, I mean there's children who are grown up now at college have never seen a spot of rain, I'd hate that  I'd rather have our, sometimes dismal climate.
Well look how we get don't we, when er we've gone too long with  shower of rain
Mm, mm.
you know the sun is nice 
That's right ,
and all that, but it the air get's so dry, that, that, you feel it wants dampening down.
that's right, and when you do get the thunder storm well my family get into their bathing costumes and go out and stand in it because it's so lovely to have the rain.
That's right.
.
Get away with that now.
Yeah.
oh well, we, really the weather's not to bad, you, you haven't got to be to sensitive about things have you, you've got to just take it enjoy the lot, enjoy
Yes, you have.
.
Yeah, so far we've been very lucky in, in Britain I think, apart from the hurricane damage, once or twice, on the whole our climates is not bad.
Oh, you  .
Yeah, but, you're mad getting worried to much, you know we had our green house all smashed up and everything and it's been upsetting ,
Yes .
erm, when you think about after all .
Yes, exactly.
Mm
.
Exactly, you can't spend your life worrying about things, people are important.
You've got to try and enjoy life.
My wife's father er he said to me, cos he was, he worked hard you know, he had a tough life you know up in London and all that as, as a kid and that and he said to me what you want to do, enjoy everyday that you live, I said yeah, oh I said oh but you can't can you?, he said yes you can.
I said but when you're doing the job that you don't like, oh don't do it he said don't do another one 
Yes.
.
He's got the right out .
Too true.
He's got the right out look.
, but he died soon after that but he'd realised that he'd worked hard all his life
Mm.
you know
Yes.
really worked hard
Yes.
and at the end of it, see you always think that you're going on don't you?
Mm, mm.
and you think oh well I'll get my prize at the end.
Mm.
Mm.
But, but, you don't know whether or not.
You never think this is my last day .
No, it can be can't it?
. Go and enjoy every, every minute of it.
Yeah, every days a bonus.
Yeah, get, get the best out of it anyway .
Yeah, you're quite right, or he's quite right.
You don't have to worry too much about money do you really so long as you can manage with it.
Ha Harry, Harry Secombe is said after his heart attack there's no pocket in the shroud.
No.
Well he's right, there are no pocket's in a shroud and he's seemed much happier since.
Yeah, oh yeah.
It's a shame with .
That's what annoys me with erm these big company's you know, opening on Sunday's really, because er, you can only get the money, I mean they've only got a certain amount
Yeah.
I mean if they could open nine days a week, they couldn't get any more money out of me because
No, you haven't got it.
No.
No.
They're, they're ,
No, me neither .
all they're doing is erm, where people do it on a Saturday they, they won't do their, go football or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens.
Yes, when it's all quite all the shops are closed .
.
Apart from religion or anything else, you know.
Yeah,.
Yeah.
It, I think it's nicer when, when it
Oh yes, not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful.
That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're all going to open up, gonna go chasing around 
Just be like a Saturday ,.
we shan't know which day, there'll be no weekend, will we really
No.
it won't be a weekend.
No 
And that it's all for money and they're doing alright, I mean they're already making so many you know, millions they're making aren't they?
Well the big ones are, yeah.
Yes.
Oh yes.
There's only one thing, it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then get taken on you know as  .
But the one's that's gonna be hit I think are, people like old Lionel.
Yes.
Mm.
Because he, he's not doing all that good you see, and when er, he, he re he reckons on Sunday
Yeah Sunday morning .
.
But I prefer Lionel, I'll go round the supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way back.
We do, we don't buy .
Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I don't like the look of that one and he'll, he'll chuck it in the back.
Mm, mm.
And he'll often say to me look there's a fresh box under there, help yourself to what you want, i haven't opened that box.
And, and if you complained about anything, er like we found, perhaps had a banana that's not been quite ripe, he'll give you two or three the next time you go in if you say anything about it 
Oh yes indeed, indeed , well only last week I said do need some flowers, come on Thursday they're fresh, I said I want them now Lionel, I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one, he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one.
Mm.
He's very good.
I think he's alright really, he, he, suppose as fair as he can be.
Yeah.
dogs.
Yeah.
Hello, good morning, good morning, all .
Can't  supermarket's gonna be open, I'll be getting their green grocery's down there and that  really.
Yes..
Told you it was a good idea to save throwing it.
Brilliant.
to it.
You taking them to Wimbledon?
That's brilliant.
My daughter says when, when did you go to Wimbledon?
.
hold a racket .
Good ball boy  a girl, quite right, gosh she's the same shape as Rocket.
They're all good dogs, but he doesn't give it back though.
He does , oh yes he does.
He might  he might do.
She, she, yeah she's given it,oh well, we've got to walk old thing I suppose, and then go to Lionel's, get some more fresh fruit.
You see they're again there you don't get it in a packet you can pick out the grapes you want.
That's right, yeah.
You can pick them out yourself.
Yeah.
Oh I, I find that   quite good, you know.
And also, you know sometimes he's prices are much better than the supermarket's prices .
Yeah , mm.
You don't have to pay for all that fancy lighting.
I've noticed that some of the apples you've been getting from Safeway haven't been very good.
No, Lionel's are better.
They're quite sour.
Mm, well apples at this time of the year are a bit sour.
Mm.
I'm sure Lionel's wouldn't be.
Crunchy, yeah, true.
I haven't had to buy any fresh .
Had enough on the tree .
Oh, you grow your own, yeah.
Yes.
Well I have only got a few courts,
Yes.
.
but in, in a month or two
Yeah.
picking  and my wife can't eat much in the way of apples
No.
she get's tummy trouble
Mm, yeah.
and they say not to eat apples and oranges, er, at one time they told you to eat the lot didn't they apples a day keep the doctor's away .
That's right, that's right 
See, I said it .
Yeah.
And apples aren't all that digestible at times.
I think, and the acid .
I think apples are very acid .
Hello Tess, how are you.
You've got a funny thing on you, you've got a think on your head, Rocket's got a thing on his ear.
Ah, there's two.
A wart.
Yeah.
Rocket's got one on his ear.
Who?
Rocket has got one on his ear.
I 
Oh.
And when he went for his injections I said to the vet can you snip that funny little growth and he said oh we'll wait until he's under, complete anaesthetic and then, it's only a little wart he said.
,.
I didn't like it .
take her and the, and the vet said the same, where that place is er a bad, a couple of years ago she had erm tick

Doesn't bother her does it?.
No, no, she's not worried, but when we took her up recently, he, he, he said it's only a wart like that, he didn't sort of worry
Mm , mm.
and when the hair goes over it doesn't notice much.
No, you can't really see the one on Rocky's ear at the moment, you can in some lights.
When ya, when ya, when you're grooming him you can.
And that's happened just recently has it?
Yeah, yeah.
No, last week  .
Well we took him , took him for his injection in October
Yeah,three or four months .
They'd have been there about a couple of weeks .
But the little dog I went, I took a friend to collect her little dog from the vet it's had a double hernia, hasn't it, double hernia, it, it had a tremendous operation dear little thing, but she said he had a wart under he's eye and on it's own accord it dried up and dropped off.
Oh did it?
Mm.
So, so Tessa's might
It might be it's just under the eye
Yeah,
down below
yeah.
it's very tiny at the moment.
but, we don't like the look of it, you know
No.
but eh, she, it doesn't seem to worry her it's not causing her any
No.
Rocky, doesn't worry him.
It seems to be worry you  .
Oh, I'm careful with the brush , I'm careful, obviously with a brush and comb, I'd hate to, hate to jab it  well we've got to go I suppose.
Ah,.
That German Shepherd having a good, oh he's gone, it's the   oh dear

Not a lot on tonight, there's only a very  apparently dropped.
Really.
So,.
Well anything else is a let down.
Take .
Want to get a comedy or a thriller or a drama .
I don't know ,.
Dances with Wolves is coming out on video now.
Ooh, do you think?
Well, it's going to be released on the twenty seventh .
I'd love to see that .
.
It's a shame cos if they sold the video .
Well I may not, I may not find it as good, don't, they always show you clips as trailers of the best bit's.
I think it's .
But if it's got anything about
.
if they've got the American Indian culture in it then it will fascinate me, yeah .
I think it has, it's  , it's got a lot of .
It's basically a love story between him and a, see he's a, he's a cowboy officer, and she, she's a Indian Squaw obviously, they fall in love and they all this sort of vote of comment on .
Yes, yes.
But there is a lot of erm, obviously the , the Indian ways and so on.
Yes, well course I.
The scenery and photography and everything suppose to be absolutely wonderful.
Yes that's worth it .
.
A lot of our modern hol 
Hello Max.
Modern   Come on, no she hasn't got anything for you,.
Come on, come on, come on.
You know, it, it makes me smile sometimes when I say  come and try the mo modern politic approach to your ache, ache's and pains, your ailments.
.
Most of it comes  think so, I mean so much of it comes from the North American Indians that
Mm.
and right back into the er, the Keltic legions and the medieval monks.
That's right, there's certainly a .
That's what I said to you, your dad when he didn't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back, and him, don't believe in these drugs and I said look, if a monk gave you this he'd, he'd give you the bark of a birch tree, pound it up in a pestle and water and you'd think it was magic  and you'd take it and you, relax your muscles, is that what it is?,
I said yes that's what Aspirin is originally  birch bark.
Well of course they used to use the poppy, for people in great pain
Oh yeah,.
amputations, child birth  gosh the leaves are thick.
Mm, they're lovely aren't they?
When ever I see these big leaves you know these big ones
Yes.
they remind me of when I was at school.
Sycamore oh, sycamore and  .
used to get told to go out in the Autumn and we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by the teacher into some woods and you would have to collect the leaves .
Actually I 
Could always , could always see if  biggest, biggest leaves like these you know,.
That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore, there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree, beautiful colour  These are  Dances with Wolves.
Oh, it's  in shop.
If it's
.
If it's good, erm, can I say truthful background of the Indians .
Well,actually  and it might be based on a true story, don't know if it
Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was doing his meditation
Yeah.
and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was fixed up 
.
Wonder what ever came of that.
Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that, because you asked a straight forward and he goes way, way, over the head 
Yeah, I know , he does versify.
and within three seconds my brain just switches off .
Well I try to
.
I, I just ask him if, and it, the question that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany,cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away 
suddenly cross your legs, ouch .
That's a good idea.
She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more.
I said no, I, I would hate to offend him because it's all so well meant  being a mother in law you have to watch it.
, honestly you couldn't be much worse than .
Oh  mother in law is.
.
She's just .
I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes, but we'll have to go to , but erm, you know, she,.
As a person, you know, I'd never have any time .
Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that great place and she's got no money 
, they're not, they're not her presents are they, they're from Diane.
No, of course, of course .
So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up spending Christmas at  gonna give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the  Christmas present .
It so .
I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her but I .
I couldn't I'm afraid.
Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun shiny little sole and she's so full of love for everybody she's so generous
Why was she?
she didn't want Vaughany to get married again.
Oh.
She used to say what Diane, I've never heard of a Diane, after they were married this
.
And when anyone treats my daughter like that I find it very hard to forgive, I know it hurts my kids, I'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me.
Remember that first Christmas when she put the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your husband told me that he can't really afford he's flying because you spend all his money, when I, when I've been backing him, saving money for his aeroplane and his lessons and
What did you say to dad?did you say that to dad didn't you say it  .
But I thought she was stirring it you see and so did Diane.
What did you tell .
I didn't believe her
You didn't, you never .
But he said, I said it as a joke when she was asking me about my flying and I said I don't do as much flying as I'd like to, I've, I've got a wife to support and she takes all the money.
But I said I am the money  I gave him his first flying lesson, I paid for it, like I bought his first three cars.
.
I excused myself and went to bed I think  but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as, say somebody saying a joking sort of way.
Yeah, good stirring .
And it was just after Frank had left her and gone to live in that place in .
Does, does anybody know what he's doing,.
Don't know, last time I asked Diane she said oh he's, he's living with this machine he's got in
What machine?
some magic machine.
What machine?
Magic machine?
Yes.
What kind of machine?
A machine he's designed, I don't know for what purpose, I didn't dare ask, I was going to ask Vaughan .
It's not to, it's not to isolate gamma rays .
Probably, but he was hiding he wouldn't come out because he said that the men from outer space were after him.
It's funny you know, I've reading, I'm reading Silence of, Silence of the Lambs at the moment and er, you know, it's got in there, a lot of er, er, mentally ill patient's have got this idea that, men, men from Mars have .
Well I said to Diane you know, I didn't laugh, I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was sad and I said but he needs help, if Vaughan's you know, he's got two sons, but Mark's a bit hopeless and he was at Oxford anyway, I said surely somebody should go and get him some  some treatment, sanitation.
Yes.
You can get cranks, you just believe in flying saucers and a quite happy harmless, but, I think they need checking on to make sure that they are  happy with the life they're leading  it bothers me a lot
So where is he now?
Well he's still in Manchester I think.
Doing what?
Is he living with, living in a .
I think he's in lodgings.
Is he?
But of course he got half the value of  Trafford Hall, which was quarter of a million?
Mm.
Something like that, eighth of a million, it'll do me anyway.
Oh listen to that bird, isn't it beautiful it's a Thrush.
Well .
That's alright  degradable.
Oh isn't it beautiful, he must think it's Spring.

So that's all I've got with me after I've been to .
Well, you've  anyway, so.
If they're more than eighty, I, I can't have it anyway.
So you want to keep
Yo-yo,.
Oh .
I'm all ready if I got my handbag, but when I start walking because of the cars being broken into I don't carry a handbag, you see, I just carry money in my pocket.
Oh, there's a lot had their cars broken into .
I've had mine done twice, mine done twice, mm, the police were up the other day lying in ambush, and I'd spotted them and phoned the local police station and said there's men lurking in the bushes of  are they policemen?, she said yes madam, they're policemen.
I don't, I thought they looked to they looked to clean and, and well groomed
Yeah.
to be erm, sort of scroungers.
Right, it doesn't pay to leave your handbag in the car.
No way.
Certainly doesn't.
It isn't the money because the insurance company pay me back the money
Yeah, yeah.
the car insurance mends my windows, but it's, it's your bank books, and your credit cards
I know.
and your driving licence
I know.
your insurance, all those little things you know, and you don't
Cos there's been a lot done, they've all done it left their bikes in the car .
Yes, yes.
Well I was in the pet shop 
tie round your neck .
Ah, but they're again they 
.
but then they could hit you on the head if they saw you've got it with you.
.
Mind you I've always got a dog and a stick .
as a puppy
Oh yeah.
.
Yes.
Stick him on the end that.
It's true.
You want to get one of those waist belts and put it under your .
In the Summer I have one of,
.
Used to be , I bought it in here ,
Yeah ,
remember the 
yeah ,
shoulder-less purses on, on a 
yeah, yeah .
well they are now, my daughter now has a proper bum bag, but this was just a school, purse for school, just for break time.
Oh yeah, yeah.
And I use that in the summer, when I don't want big pocket's 
Yeah, yeah, good idea .
I think  .
Keep your hands free 
I must have washed me hands .
You have to think when you've got, like me with my two little grand daughters, you know .
That's right , you need three hands..
True, if I'm, if I know I want, might want something extra, I, I, stick a fiver in, this pocket
Yeah.
If I loose it well, it's, hard cheese.
Yeah.
It's better than er
Yeah.
better than this thing
.
cos my daughter you see, I get so cross if anyone's at my car, I'm likely to go for them.
I nearly caught a man once erm, but I turned the whistle to the dog and he must of heard me, he dropped, into his car and drove off, if I could of got the dog in faster I'd, I'd chased him, my daughter said, no you stand back and take no not , but I'm not like that you see.
No, you think why should they get away with it .
Yes, I'd whack him on the head with me stick or something.
Yeah.
And of course I'd get accused of assault.
Oh, you'd be the one in trouble.
Oh yes, oh yes, I would, I'm sure I would.
Thank's a lot girls.
. Are you looking at they big doggy?
I was looking at the scalectrix.
Scalectrix, that's the next thing is it?

Mm, mm, shop  
What is that patch for?
I don't know..
.
I don't know my dear.
Hello baby we weren't long were we?
Haven't seen Dan in there for a long time, I thought he'd left Lionel and gone off to get a  a highly lucrative job somewhere  You don't somehow expect to see a, a young man with a university degree working in your local green grocer do you?
Mm, what's his degree in?
I haven't asked him, I didn't like to.
They must have been high up in the tree,leaves.
Is that a Beech tree?
Yeah, that's a Beech tree 
Where's the .
Beg your pardon, you're right
I didn't recognise it, it hasn't got any leaves on.
I beg your pardon, it does look like a Beech bowl doesn't it?
Yeah it does,.
Yes, you're quite right it is.
No up where the other's are, where they've just hidden in the bushes, I found sum brand new ones on Wednesday or Thur , after we had the heavy rain  Why we going this way?
.
Oh, I'm very fond of the meadow walk  get any more wild ,actually, I suppose there are rabbits and things up here.
But there are.
We should come one day at dusk and the bunny hoppers will be out, or of course very early in the morning.
Why, you wouldn't come very early in the morning.
.
.
brooks lovely isn't it?
The what?
.
Oh yes.
I don't think I've ever been to , quite pleasant  .
Surely that's the , that is the house where Queen Elizabeth the first spent all her girl hood.
I've no idea.
perhaps it was burnt down and re-built or something  didn't seem at all tudorish did it?
.
.
You think all the big houses in London that are now  official Government  all along the strand big private houses, Savoy Palace, The .
Mm.
Way back in the thirteen, fourteenth century.
Mm.
And your name sake Barnard of Bolier that's his palace opposite on the other bank of the Thames.
Mm  .
I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
Eighty gardens, oh  made me laugh.
Well that's not what amazes me, eighty gardens.
Eighty gardens, but then as a place that size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be 
Well I expect now, they've got about five .
I should think they probably still, in the, in the high season, I should think they probably still need fifteen, twenty 
Oh look,tractor  .
I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he?
Mm.
And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
Mm.
But if they can use that er beautiful water 
Ah right.
to generate their own electricity, save them a bomb and they can sell some as well.
I know a lot of people say they shouldn't 
Good idea .
have houses that size, but I think it's an awful shame to let our heritage go.
Yeah, I agree, if people did .
I tell you another thing that amazes me, how any one with a Sovereign right,were a Sovereign in those days, could have given up the palace of Westminster which is so beautiful,palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of  is it?
.
It was only built erm, what a couple of hundred years ago wasn't it?
What Buckingham Palace?
Mm.
I don't know, I didn't realise.
At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful building
Mm.
and of course they had the Thames which was their main highway, Thames was much easier to use than 
Well that was Buckingham Palace was er .
Oh yes.
.
Oh yeah.
.
I think Buckingham Palace is lovely compared to Westminster Palace, beautiful old stone and the, and the shape of it and it's windows, it's beautiful  huge of course, there again the court then had loads and loads of er, there were ten .
..
And a lot of the Government, Governing people of the country  Oh it is a bit chill and damp isn't it?
Did you mention anything to your dad about wanting to watch  Dances with Wolves?

No, no ,

why you gonna get something
heart's delight.
something more adventure, I don't want to buy it, I may, I may not be that keen on it

Didn't like Fantasia, where I can listen to the music and watch them.
Oh, we'll see what's going on, have a look .
I would like to see Dances with Wolves  he'll probably be asleep any way Dinda.

Not the other way round of course.
No, no.
Dogs from Britain can practically live anywhere
Yeah.
Hel hello Topsy, hello Topsy, I'll shall squeeze your feet if you do it any more, I'll shall squeeze your paws and you won't like it.
Is that a good way of stopping her doing it?
Mm, I always use to do it with my German Shepherd.
Yeah, but they don't .
Cos, cos they're big enough, if they even in love, they can knock a child, well they could knock a grown up flat on your back.
She'll not be too .
Yes, no squeeze the paws ,
We got  ,
not, not too hard for her but enough so that it's uncomfortable
yeah.
and they hate it, and after, after a week, after a week of having their paws squeezed every time they jump up,stop .
I've a lot, a lot of my friends have got  big dogs and they say oh they will jump up and I say squeeze her paws, it usually works
Mm.
in a week, ten days, something like.
I'll have to do that.
They're a very , but they can still knock you flat on your back.
Oh yeah, well she's had a, a some old chap who was walking around here, she just ran past him
Yeah.
and she just caught the back of his leg  .
Oh yeah , behind your knees you can.
He just crumpled up.
I say she's only doing, she's only playing around.
Oh yes, it's all affection.
Mm, I'll have to try that with the feet, come on.
Bye, bye.
Do you want to play?, want to play?get it, get it,

Another seven months.
Seven months.
And they can't keep her?
Pardon .
Moving , moving to America.
Oh what a shame, have they got somebody to take.
Well I'd imagine they'd go too  there, and they're still looking for someone .
Oh,.
You'd like to take her would you?
.
When she was trained, stop jumping up and things she'd be a nice dog.
, if I wasn't at work I'd take her like a shot.
Yes, so would I.
Wee, get it.
But erm
Get it.
, you should have told him to put an advert in .
Have ads in where?
I don't think they're  been yet.
I would imagine .
Where you going?
Into the dog walk.
Come on

After you.

Hello, alright 
I wouldn't trust those two any further than I can throw them.
My instincts straight away.
Mm.
You reckon, you reckon they're Bonny and Clyde do you?
I wouldn't be surprised if they were the sort of people who had the stolen bicycle down in the bushes.

Chance of bright spells this afternoon, getting horrendously murky.
.
Oh look over there, it's, it's 
.
black, except for the occasional, little topping of gold.
Yeah,is it?
Try and get one of these gadgets, and see if we can er get the nightingales next week.
There's 
I don't suppose the radio part of this is put in then,.
I'm not messing with it, just  recording playing back.

Not that I like walking around with music blasting anyway, I'd rather listen to the birds.
Mm  oh, I'm warm now after that walk.
Good.
.
No sign of Sam, ah here he comes, hold on then, the dogs gonna have a talk.
Your friend's coming, your friend's coming, your friend's coming, look, look who's that, who's that, who is it?
Who's down there, who is it, who is it, who is it?.
Hello Sam, hello, hello, hello, hello.
He don't know who to say hello to.
Hello Sam.
He don't know who to say hello to  you or me or what .
Three of us  he's gonna have a widdle, that'll sort all the problems out, hello.
How's , how's your eye.
Keep still a minute, let's have a look, come here, Sam, Sam 
Hey, Sam, Sam , come here.
Keep your head still a minute we want to look at your nutter.
It looks much better doesn't it?
Getting your fur fur back.
That's right, you see to him, go on you see to him, you see to him,.
Trouble is Rocky, Rocky's knackered from his walk and so is .
, hello Davy .
That's great , Rocky, Rocky's panting a bit, seems a bit tired but Sam's all fresh.
He has, he hasn't been very active actually 
There is an unfair advantage here 
He was looking 
sleeping in the car today, that's what it is he's just woken up.
Cos I looked  .
He's been asleep in the car .
Yeah.
Oh, cos I looked him up and I thought 
Yeah, yeah, both coming back , now just had a bald patch.
Yeah.
There's been  and that, he's been out this morning as well up to Hill and oh up to the Ridges as well 
Good gracious.
should be tired.
Oh they do  up the Rid up the Ridges?
Er, I didn't see any up there no .
Simon's Wood?
Nor Simon's, no I was in there yesterday there was none in there yesterday .
Oh, they've, they've  then, good.
Cos I think they'd gone some time ago.
What a shame they've missed their walk together.
Yes, still, you just going back now are you?
No, we came a bit earlier because it was so dingy.
Just done the circuit, he has.
Oh I see, I did the front of my car that's why I was a bit late, I usually I'm a bit earlier than this.
We met er, a beautiful old English sheep dog, seven months old and they've got to find a new home for it, because they're off to America.
Ah, that's a shame .
Well I said they're except British dogs in America.
Dog's from England can go anywhere, it's just coming back in, the problem .
Come back in yes, the erm
And he said yes but it's, it's the accommodation we've got, maybe it's a Company move and they've given them an apartment or something, seven months old, you know, that big, so by the time 
It's a shame isn't it?,
she's grown up, she's
don't they?
Yeah, yeah, beauty, beauty.
Still, they might hear of somebody who  wants one .
Oh yeah, you know .
Well I should think they'd probably advertise .
at the vet's and so on, you know.
That's right, yeah.
.
.
It's a pedigree, weren't he?
Yes.
She was a, she was a pedigree  .
Yes, Topsy, Topsy .
I was just looking at that tree, the way it's stunted up there, I haven't really noticed before.
Oh yes.
That's where, where it fell off in all the hurricane.
That's right, yeah.
That's topped.
it's top 
, there's another one in there.
Mm.
.
Plenty of good firewood isn't there?
Mm.
There is.
A bit of it has rotted now though .
Yes.
It'll still, it'll still burn nicely 
It's got to be  .
Oh it's still burn alright.
Mm, I'm surprised they .
Lovely smells to when it's burning.
Mm, it is nice.
And of course the erm, those sort with all the redden in them, muddly blue flames and they keep spitting and given pretty, pretty pictures, it's gorgeous.
Yeah, Pine they do that don't they?
Yeah.
They do .
Yes, we have to trim our Pine trees occasionally, the firs, and ooh they smell beautiful on the bonfire .
Even ones on the  , mm.
I had a go at that didn't I one year?
Yes, you did .
Made a real mess of it .
Mm,.
And she did very well .
Cutting down trees .
Yeah.
in Summer  big ones like that, sort of, I, I had to use the a chain saw.
Yeah.
Joyce said oh we'll be alright this winter.
Yeah, yeah.
.
I've got out of the way of, I've often said to Dinda, you know, I wouldn't mind going back to an open fire in the winter.
No, I wouldn't
I miss it now after all these years.
Oh never mind, when I was first married, it was carry coals up two flight of stairs to start with.
Oh .
It was me who did it, not my husband.
He use to sit there and say, is it getting cold in here? and muggings I use to get up and feed the fire and go down and , I, I can't believe it when I think back you know.
Well you do exactly the same thing now ,
Yes ,
it's obviously in your nature isn't it?
yes .
Turn the heating up I should think.
Yeah, yeah, you know if there's anything to be done, up she goes and does it.
Getting cold .
Yeah, they told .
Yeah, that's right.
You know,.
Well we used to take it in our stride, I mean I grew up with an old Victorian house with potent fires and you had keep the fires going either wise in the winter it was bitterly cold, it was nice and cool in the summer coming out of the heat.
Yeah.
But in the winter you needed the kitchen range and the dining room and drawing room needed fire then, and if anybody's was ill we had fireplaces in the bedrooms of course.
Mm.
But since I slept in, what used to be the maid's bedroom , I was always
I say, when you look at those days you wake up and .
that's right, yeah, yeah.
I pull them open and do that now, I must admit.
Old, old sash windows .
I wouldn't, I wouldn't last five minutes .
I need my heating .
Oh,you would , you would.
Well not now.
With sash windows, with the wind howling round them.
But, it's, it's funny though you  didn't they?
Stone floors down stairs .
Would you know, we didn't have any serious illnesses as children, the only place we had a bit of warmth, used to have a valour lamp in the bathroom in the winter, had a valour lamp in there to keep the chill off .
Remember those  ones we used to have, the yorkstone, did you ever, ever had one of those?
With the round  .
, the valours were , yeah, with, with the little er, shiny 
.
handle with a bit of erm,
It used to have a handle come right over when you lifted it up .
That's right, yeah, that's it, yes , and about that tall with a sort of round top and a slim bit and then legs, four legs on the bottom,
That's it four legs, yeah.
yeah, yeah.
I had for years.
Yeah, yeah 
Making you run around is he Sammy?
Done him the world of good .
You're gonna sleep tonight aren't you Rocket?.
I like the friendly nudge up the tail.
He'll give you a kiss .
Come on 
Give me a kiss.
I'm honoured.
He's a beaut.
Mm, good old boy aren't you? mm.
I haven't seen him stand still in one place for this long for ages.
No I haven't.
, it must be almost ten minutes .
He'll make up for it.
In fact Rocky's gone, Rock where you gone?
Come Rocky
.
Funny he gets the wonder lust when he meets Sam he goes off doesn't he?
.
Mm.
Yeah, he thinks cor I'm off now Sam .
Well they usually go off together you see.
Mm.
Go off, on, on forays together don't they?
.
How old is Sam?.
Gone fox hunting I think .
How old is Sam?
Erm he's about seven, but I'm not sure how old when I first had him, cos he's a stray, a stray .
Yeah .
Mm .
I think he's about under a year when  ,
Yeah .
not much more than a year, but they've .
He's about seven then.
Well he's much younger than Rocket who must be we reckon, no 
Rocket must be about nine or ten , oh.
well he should only be eight and a half, I mean they told us he was three and a half when he was rescued .
well we'll call him nine , he must be about nine.
They told us three and a half, but there again a lot of rescue people do cut the ages of their dog, but, but, our, our two vets agreed he was around three and a half, between three and a half and four, look at his teeth and his coat and his bones .
His eyes .
Had him five years so.
Yes, he's probably about
Yes, between eight and a half to nine, we just  in a dogs life a year, is seven of ours .
Seven years .
Yes.
Mm.
But, George's still just a great puppy aren't you?
Still a great puppy, yes, yes.
Rocket's fifty six, catching up on me.
Oh there's Sheba, she's aged, by Jove she's aged ,
German Shepherd .
I mean Roxanna at her age wasn't still very full of life ,
.
she's only a pup.  some dogs do  .
aged quite rapidly, we were lucky with ours  cos at the time I couldn't, you know thought she was about twelve ,
She's very well looked after ,
till she was about twelve she was quite  .
ever so bright, yes , they were playing and chasing sticks and
.
I think it depends on the size .
Thirteen she was .
.
Actually she's not simply long coated like Roxanna was she's over coated if anything.
Yeah, she is, very, very long .
She is, she is , Very seldom you see a dog like that.
She's very heavy and the size of her feet.
Mm, mm.
In fact she's a throw back, it's as almost as though she's got some  some  Alaskan type dog in her
Mm.
.
or Husky type dog.
You don't see many like that .
No, no  no she's not quite full of big boned, but by Joe
, they've both stopped,, I don't know what they're looking at .
.
They're probably listening , listening for the foxes or something.
Heard something over there.
,.
Obviously they heard something.
I'd have to take down the shore,shore tomorrow .
Yeah.
Saves leaving them in the car, probably only for about two hours, I don't know if it's better leaving at home or taking with me, there's  .
Don't you , don't you find he'd rat he'd much happier sitting in the car?
He seems to be, yes 
Than left at home, where you've gone away somewhere without him .
Well I don't really know, cos I don't know what he's like at home, you see by himself, huh.
No, exactly .
But my dogs have always, much rather come shopping with me and sit in the,.
It's a short time though isn't it?.
Yes.
It's not very long, see I say, what  .
Oh I don't know the supermarkets the best part of an hour this time of year.
I suppose it is,.
But, oh he's quite happy , he'll curl up in the back of a car, but when I come home and he goes so berserk if I've left him at home, I know that he's been watching and listening and waiting for me all that time.
He usually sits up at the window  .
That's right, yeah ,
.
but he knows where your car is you're not far away.
Yes that's true.
I think they work it out that way.
.
At least you can let him, give him a run.
Yes I can down there, yeah,.
Yes, Mrs  up just behind isn't  round by the air field .
Oh yes, there's the air field there isn't there?
Yes.
I've never been to the air field.
Oh, that's where we usually end up I'm afraid.
.
air field.
Well we go down there for all the permits and things anyway you see, recording there with the documents the P F A.
.
Look at his tail going, no don't Sam, leave it,
Come on.
don't kill anything else.
Sammy come on,, come on.
As long as it's not a fox .
Yes, we can do without another fox fight.
, come on Sammy  Sammy 
This morning we heard two thrush's singer their spring song.
Yeah, it was amazing.
Beautiful
Singing their hearts out.
Was they?
Beautiful.
Think it's spring I suppose this weather.
, they, remember last, end of last winter when it got mild after the cold spell, they were building their nests and then we got all that cold weather again, all the, all the fledglings were dead.
They died .
Nests I found when I was clearing the garden, put the little eggs in and they'd all gone cold.
Yes, yes.
.
But, you think they had   most of them do don't they?
Yeah.
They heard the geese know when to fly North, and when to fly South and navigate by the stars and by the lay lines in the earth, it's just isn't it magical?
.
No, no way, we used to, we used to, I mean ancient man did 
, oh they did, yeah 
They navigated by the, by the ley lines , that's why you find monuments built up on hills so they could stand in the middle of the of nowhere and they could see a, they could either feel it through their feet
Yeah.
where the, where the main lines were, or they could look and see erm, what do you call them, those groups of trees on tops of hills they used
Oh I know.
there's one near Shoreham.
.
Oh,places like that.
Oh yeah.
They could see them and navigate by them, if they haven't got the sun or the stars, yeah, yeah, we've lost all that of course, as we got what we called civilised, we've lost all those old skills.
.
Yes
.
Yeah,
.
I was stationed right on the Pilgrims Way
Really?, oh.
Mm, mm,.
, I erm,
Oh yes.
I tried to phone the , now who was it I saw,on a Saturday wasn't it, a Saturday, ah, it's still in there
Yes.
and I, I went home, phoned them and he said well, I got , there's nobody there, try he said between five and six that's his lunch hour , so I phoned, couldn't get, oh no I, I thought well it'll be too if I don't get  so I  took it home
Yeah.
and I tried all weekend trying to get  only there from five to seven, and I got him after five o'clock on Tuesday
Yeah.
and er, I told him all about it, and I said I don't know what happened to  I spoke to somebody last Monday and he was coming down immediately for it, so he sort of said, well I'll come down for it, there's a different one, he got , and he came down for it and he took it, so er,.
So, who, you took it out of the bushes.
Yes, I took it out of the bushes get .
Yeah, it's gonna get rusted or, or
Well somebody take it  the owner wanted it back.
Yeah.
So he's gonna look all the way through the records .
So it wasn't the bicycle people that, that the two, that they were laying in ambush for, must of been the car thieves they were laying in ambush for.
.
four hours .
Suppose they would, yes, yes.
No, I think, I, I, he said, well, what with these, these he said, this is probably why he couldn't get down
Yes.
probably forgot it.
Oh.
So anyway , probably hear a name  who it was.
Mm, mm 
.
Yes, I hope so too, but, I have the feeling that the next, the next time we looked I don't remember it having green peddles the first time you found it
Oh.
Sam found it.
.
I mean they were bright green, and I thought it was a different bike, I didn't even  noticed the second time if it was a ladies or a man's bike.
Well it looked as  cos when I picked it up, there's a sort of  thing was blown over,
Yes.
so yes it could of been, yes, a long time actually.
Yeah, yeah.
.
It wasn't muddy or rusted or anything.
No, no, it's got a bit of rust around the cha bit on the chain
Yeah.
but as you say, we haven't had much rain, have we ,
No, no .
it could have been .
Don't know, lost them both.
They've gone off together now , another one joined in now, hello.
Hello.
Don't know where's Sam gone?
Sammy.
I'd better grab Rocket.
Come on quickly.
No that's Rocket.
Sam.
Probably 
Rocky come on.
Ah could well be, we might see, we might see you tomorrow

I don't think, I don't think we'll be at the air field tomorrow.
Come on.
Have a nice day at Shoreham.
Sam where are you?
Great, enjoy yourself, bye, bye.
Rocket come.

Well actually a girl friend of mine came round here yesterday, oh, lunch timeish was it, and erm, Henry forget his ball, he got so excited of the though of going out he put it down in the hall, came here and was thoroughly miserable all the way round, without his ball his lost, you know, a dog walk isn't a dog walk for Henry.
A stick won't do?
No, chases it twice and then Lucy takes on and eats it for him.
Yes.
So anyway, how's life been with you?
Oh, not bad.
Good.
But tediously, but same as usual .
Does your daughter live with you?
Oh yeah
or is, she does?
Oh yes, oh yes, still .
.
Marvellous.
One human being on your side, if  .
Yes  .
Couldn't be more right .
yeah.
Couldn't be more right, except that 
It's a funny thing though, because mother's and daughter's , and er, I love, when my mum comes up she's a dreadful sleeper and if you're having a bad time, you get up in the middle of the night to go and make a cup of tea, there's always a little voice says, yes, let's have a cup of tea dear.
And you can sit and rabbit
Yeah.
to the point where my father-in-law woken up in his room with hilarious giggles which don't take long to ensue
.
and it's one of life's real treats.
Yes.
Real treats.
Mm, oh yes, Dinda is er, she's inclined to be a little too
Protective of you.
yes and she cannot discriminate her feelings.
Mm, mm.
When she disapproves of something you've said or done.
As it comes.
Well she does, she doesn't say it, she 
,
doesn't say all that much, she'll probably just get up and walk out of the room or, or heave a big sigh or something.
yeah.
Was a  to have on your side around the place, it's probably without .
You know I think I would.
Yes, I'm sure you would.
Oh mum rings up every now and again, father is driving me batty
Yes.
mother you do not have to stay there, why, I mean he's quite capable looking after himself for a weekend, you know my father had a series of stroke's when he was in his fifties
Yes.
mainly because of hard work, self induced, he was just a compulsive workaholic
Yes.
and, he loved what he did, he  that nobody could have survive, and then my mother who's mentally unimpaired, but in sudden decay  overnight and she has to look after him 
Yes.
but having said that she's got a  sort of ready meal, all you have to do is use one hand either pick your plate up, put it in the microwave and you've got a cooked meal
Yes.
and  on his own, and said to mum, come up here and get away for the weekend, cos it's a hell of a burden to carry, with no release, I mean even going on holiday, she has to book it, organise his packing, wash it, you name it,.
Isn't it?
Erm you  
.
more often than he was, but it didn't use to be like this.
The first time we had a break together, Dinda said let's go out, I said well somewhere fairly close where we can take little Rocket
Yes.
so we took a cottage on Canvey Island
Yes.
I've always heard it was a bit of a sort of a
Mm.
Blackpool type thing, it was beautiful, lovely countryside ,
You had a wonderful time ,
absolutely gorgeous.
mm.
Would you believe that he said I've got to work on the aeroplane this week, I've got the week off, I've got to work on the aeroplane, I, you know, I shall be alright, down the airfield, er on the Wednesday he arrived to see how we were getting on, complaining like made because he hadn't been able to find where the cottage was, I said but I'd left you a detailed map ,
Oh god .
I'd left you the full address, and the telephone number and a fully detailed map.
Why is he so helpless?.
I said, that, erm, begrudgingly I must admit, I said, you gonna stay overnight, no, no, I've come to take you both out to dinner.
He is good, I've got to work, that's an excuse
Oh I know does .
but I've got to work on the plane tomorrow.
You know when we came back the next Saturday as we've gone through the front door, he'd gone to the Little Chef for breakfast because there weren't any crocks left to u , to use
Oh no.
the kitchen was piled up, I, I, Dinda took my suitcase upstairs, I'd seen to the dog, he was very, very good in the car as you know er, I took my suitcase, I couldn't get through the bedroom door, the bed clothes on the floor where it's, where we've had a sudden hot spell, he hadn't folded them up 
Oh, thrown them off ,
and put them in the spare room
thrown them off.
just, just, left them lying on the floor.
.
It's for spite, I mean, he was, he was quite capable of doing the .
Oh yeah absolutely, like my father 
Just  .
My father likes being waited on
Oh yes.
mum is there and is expected to do it, I mean mum is .
Yes.
It really annoys me, and every now and again I sit him down and say now look you, oh Henry, and he adores, the actual, personally my father adores my mother and the sun has always shone out, she's the only person in the world for him
Yes.
but, he will, I think, unwittingly use the .
Was he the only son?
He was the only child.
Yes, yes.
Absolute menace
Yes.
but then,married, married he was one of three boys, and his mother never worked, you know she would keep the house clean, as everything, they must have  father about .
I love
Go on.
I love wallowing in a hot bath.
Erm came  and shower occasionally and if you bath, I said to him, do your mother  ever, to pick a, a damp towel up off the floor, but, did you have a bath, and all ,
Yes.
why was it my job always to go in pick them up and .
.
I mean I use to do a full time job outside the home, then come back and do all the housework and the washing and the children .
.
This is what happen when .
Let's have it then Henry, leave it.
Go and find daddy.
Hello.
Throw my ball.
.
Come on down.
Bally down Henry, come along, Henry, bally down, good boy, there, there, that  good and soggy and she'll really enjoy that.
Oh lovely.
not throw it at the cyclist had I?
Better not throw it, wait
, if you do up in the air, he's only got two dimensional vision Henry, he never looks up at anything.
You too.
But, erm, I told you the story of our cleaning lady .
No.
Well, two or three years ago, I said to  really mad, there's me working full time, him on shifts and me Monday to Friday, nine till five, come Friday night I start and I spend the entire weekend washing, ironing, cooking, and
That's right.
I was just in time for Sunday night,bath, hair wash and all the usual things
Yes.
In order to fit and  to go back to work on Monday morning.
That's right.
And I said to him I've worked out that less in the mornings  to have a firm come in, you know  
Molly maid, yep .
to come in and blitz the place from top too bottom and if we just have them once a fortnight, the in between weekend I can whiz round,
Yes.
because he wouldn't of got that awful.
Well, not with both of you out .
, and they came for eighteen months, two years, at the end of which the quality of the work had deteriorated, price was rocketing up
Yeah.
and more seriously then, insisted on coming on a Wednesday lunch time.
Now Wednesday I do all the intensive care men and
Yeah
it's not an easy option, you really need to come home lunchtime after all of them and
Relax .
peace and quite , not  vacuum cleaner going round
Mm, mm.
so I kept saying to her please would you do another day
I don't know I'm not use to going in the meadows.
please would you, not, come on a Wednesday by all means
Lucy.
but can you just avoid my lunch hour.
Mm.
What we gave you is the time they come and the next weekend they were back again, and I'd warned them several times and in the end I said look forget it, and I had it, you know, the works gone off, erm, and as far as I'm concerned it's Wednesday nights, I've really got to , and the price I started to pay, is no longer worth it to me.
,
Rocket.He's eating something little devil.
Stop it, no.
Come, come, come, come on.
as your told.
Erm, and I said to him you will help me won't you, you won't go back to me doing everything, oh lord he said, I'll, I'll do my share, so we went back to a routine, whereby I did, washing, ironing, cooking, cleaning, washing the car, mowing the lawn, doing the flower beds, and the doing the , he walked the dog.
, oh typical .
And I was never terrible short , sorry Henry didn't mean to tread on you.
Never, take note, not down here  it's full of leaves and you'll never find it again.
I never saw that it was quite in balance, but you know you just, it's a case, if somebody else doesn't do something and you can't stand looking at it  you will get on and do it,
Yeah.
which is something they get to rely on  and I should keep thinking, that's a hell of a  for them because he's never in all our married life washed a sock
No.
I mean, clean clothes just magically appeared and  ironed,
Mind you that  .
and at the moment he's living in a hostel where, I don't know too much about it, where you have clean sheets put on for them
Oh, how nice.
endless hot water, but I mean I .
I can't remember, his life, he's trying to find what an iron looks like, he's never ironed a hanky in his life.
My husband hasn't.
Never, ever.
I can't, I can't remember Pete ever changing sheets on the bed, ever.
No, it doesn't cross their mind .
Not even when I got a new baby was it.
Did you ever, did he ever clean the loo's for you?
No, oh no.
Why was, that's what really used to get to me.
I lead .
Come back 
I, I ,
from work as a somebody and at home I was the loo cleaner.
yes, I had exactly the same thing, being a top flight secretary at work
Yes, come home and nothing but the lady with 
Yes ,
the Harpic, with her head down the loo.
that's right, and not even, not even a word of appreciation for, a, a sale you've clinched or a good impression you've made on the end deal 
It's that, that is the ultimate thing, that is the ultimate thing ,
or something.
no, it is all 
Which reflects on 
taken as red, with no credit given to you
your boss of course.
That's right.
if on the other hand he has  haven't done your chores,on a Sunday, er, how do you expect him to live in a place like this.
Yes.
Excuse me we both live here, we both work full time.
Yes.
And in fact he had more useful hours of daylight in the evening than I did .
Well I use, I use to work longer hours.
Yes.
Than my husband did..
.
Cos I was out with my first daughter at quarter to eight in the morning to catch the bus to take her to adopted aunty
Mm.
and he was still sort of erm, just .
Jerking.
Yes, exactly, and I'd be out in all weather's 
 
to catch the bus,
yes.
erm, and then get back and I, I was worked 
It was  ,
eight thirty to five thirty
and it's a long day and then you'd have to come back and your day's far from over.
Oh too true.
Then you  and said right 
Yes .
It's not just the cooking, I mean he can  cook, but you need somebody else to say, what are we going to have and either go and buy it or this and that and  
They don't think about it .
It's all that.
What about the clearing up when they have, when they have cooked.
Oh yes.
The use three dishes and bowls for everyone 
Oh yeah ,
you've used.
oh absolutely, absolutely .
It's horrendous .
Yes, they, it really is extraordinary.
My son in law's, one of them is not too good 
Good morning .
but at least he does decorate, good morning, he does decorating and things and he helps like that ,
Henry bally please .
and he will do a bit of washing up, they don't want to use the washing up machine.
Henry bally, come on bally down, come on Ginny  .
But my middle son in law is absolutely marvellous.
He wants, he wants to  .
did he come out off?,.
I don't know.
Watch him Henry, watch him .
His mother had two sons, and she said they're not going to be helpless, you've lost it stupid.
.
They both went into the Scout's and the Rangers and Edie made each of them do their own bed, do their bedrooms on Saturday's
Oh.
and now, I mean, Debbie, Debbie has  well Debbie is 
And somebody somewhere is reaping the benefit of  appreciate all 
Debbie's got this horrendous pregnancy having lost two baby's you see
Yes.
she's got this horrendous pregnancy 
.
now, and Richard is working all day and because Debbie's been told she's got to have bed, bed rest
Yeah.
Erm, he'll come in in the evening he's done the shopping, he cleans the house, they live in a converted barn
Mm.
so you can imagine how big it is.
don't.
He vacuums, he cooks her a meal
Oh god 
To try and tempt her appetite because she's throwing up 
Did you say she had two son's?, is the other one married?.
Two sons , the other one's dead.
Oh shame .
Yep.
That's my sort of chap.
Yep.
I'm afraid he er 
Yet there are some around .
he was one of the sixties products who got onto all the drugs and things 
.
Yep, and had a stroke, a brain haemorrhage .
Oh lord .
Mm.
But you know honestly, the mother's like Ken, who do their children absolutely no, no, they're now the proud owner's of three sons all of them, well John's on his second marriage, Ken's on his second marriage and  will be on his second marriage
Yep.
and quite honestly, I think they not only do they not bring them up to do, I mean useful like that, but I thought Ken's  his family never showed any affection any warmth, any caring, any love, and I would do anything for anyone if they just say thank you, but with Ken 
My mother in law, was just, that, the other way round.
She was drooling all over him
Oh .
in his fifties, it was my baby boy.
Oh .
It used to make you want to throw up sometimes.
Believe .
I couldn't believe it when I first, first year of marriage and when I got pregnant, er, we'd walk into her, well it's her daughter's erm sitting room, she'd struggle up out of an arm chair and I'd think oh gosh, I know she mustn't get up for me, got the tummy out here ,
Yes .
and the baby  have this chair, not her pregnant daughter in law, but her baby boy.
Oh god.
All six foot of him.
Oh poor little soul.
Oh Jesus how can you  .
No darling you mustn't do that, I'll shall, I'll shall take your cup out .
Let her get on with it?
Well I worked, he took me out
Yeah, but, I had to take over, where she left off.
I know, it is alarming isn't it?
I, it took me a long time, time to realise that one can be  for a mug.
otherwise the place was a tip.
Oh yes, I used to live, we used to live in a three bedroomed semi in  before we moved to our present house, and one Christmas Ken said why don't  all our family to us, which was his mother, his father, his elder brother, his wife, two little girls from them, Tony, Karen and their little one
God.
grandmother and I think there was an aunt, and I said Ken were living in a three bedroomed semi, oh they won't mind for Christmas.
They won't mind.
And they rang up, and they said were sending you a list of what we expect to be available in the way of food at Christmas because we always have the same thing.
Yes.
, and I ended up virtually  people in a fish tank.
Yeah.
And they all said now look is there anything we can do and I said no, it's not, if you're coming to me as far as I'm concerned I will do it, you need anything and I will cope.
not one of those females worked
Oh no.
they were all at home all day I was 
Oh no .
the only one who worked full time, they came on Christmas Eve with reluctant, because I said look I'm sorry but I have to work Christmas Eve lunch time, and they said right we'll be there at five past one, and I finish at one, there were there at five past one, they finally left two days after Christmas because I said I'm sorry I have to go back to work today.
Yes.
Oh, oh, well we'd better go then, but we'll come back next year because that was good I said no I'm sorry you won't actually I'm going  I've done my little bit for a while, no one else  .
my daughter's now .
And I thought what a fool, none of them work
No.
and I spend the whole bloody lot slaving all Christmas 
You should have said so and so could you come and do so and so love, my daughter's now do Christmas for me 
Jesus .
because one Christmas about four,
.
four years ago
chain saw?
I think so.
Henry, Lucy   Lucy, oh she's such a rat bag, hang on to go and get her  over here.
Come on, come on, it's a horrible noise isn't it?
Oh yes, it's just under growth.
You know we were saying about erm 
Foxes and rabbits 
Claire and 
Yeah, oh great.
.
Great.
But I found that 
But erm ,
now, I mean my girls used to come to me with boy, boy friends as they grew up and then husbands, but they always help, they always 
yeah ,
helped with the bedrooms and things like that you see,
now that's what I  the family would do.
the clearing up, they always gave a hand, but even so, they, they didn't realise that the three weeks before hand 
The sheer graft of trading round the shops, getting it all in , humping it all home,
The lists, the planning, the food .
packing it all away
Yes , yes, and all the rest of it .
and all the rest of it .
Oh my god.
My husband's eh, never bought the Christmas presents, he buys one and usually he'd only get that from one of the girls, what shall I get mum can you do  .
So he doesn't actually go out and do
He doesn't have to do anything, but about four Christmas's ago I had the whole lot down, I had nine of us for the whole Christmas week, erm, Boxing Day I went in the kitchen, two of Diane's friends had arrived, who lived in London and I went in the kitchen, I'd had a bad dose of the flu virus that was 
Oh ,
going around and I'd worked right through it because of all the Christmas preparation
we don't have another option do you?
and I went into the kitchen and I fell down, first time in my life, I've never passed out, not 
That's right ,
even in pregnancies or anything
mm.
next thing I remember was being undressed and in bed with Debbie standing there with a boiled egg on a tray, saying mummy were so sorry you'll never do Christmas again, you've done it for us for forty years, we shall do it for you now.
Oh, bless her cotton socks.
And they have ever since.
Oh bless them, and let them keep on doing it .
But there again you see I go in the kitchen and say right, want to do spuds 
Here I am , shall I start on this, or do you want me to do that, I know 
Yeah , what would you like me to do?
Yes.
If, I say, if you want me out of the kitchen just say so, I don't want to be under your feet .
But if  absolutely you won't go quietly , but
And they either say go and read the paper mum, I'll call you in half an hour.
Yes, and then you'll feel you don't want to be  , yes absolutely, I know.
And we get on fine .
It takes you a long while to realise what a twit you've been for so long.
Yes.
Oh bless their hearts, they'd always helped, but they hadn't realised I think .
Yes but until you are the one who does it you have no comprehension of what is involved.
Yes, yes, Diane was the first 
This year I have my mummy and my daddy coming up for a couple of days and that will be fine
Yeah.
I enjoy 
But I'm 
looking after them.
forty now you see, so.
Well I'm forty two.
Yeah, well my eldest daughter's forty
Is she?
Yeah.
Oh which is the one that is pregnant with the terrible time?
That's Debbie, she's, she's, she'll be thirty this month 
Yes, it's a funny old thing, actually I must tell you I feel an awful lot better since I've passed my  I suppose, last Friday I saw a Solicitor and the divorce is now actually sat up on it's merry way rejoicing, and
I think you're much better off.
for the first time since he went 
I envy you .
I actually slept the entire night, because I thought goody, as soon as the divorce goes off, the sooner I'm on my way out of the ar oh Rocky , Rocky your head was in the way it was your own silly fault 
He's got nothing left , he's got nothing left..
, he's probably widdleing nothing, poor  that wasn't worth sitting down for, no to think that once I've gone on, which I did on Friday, I'm now on my way out the other end
.
it's absolute bliss.
.
Yes, I think I do.
Oh   .
I was talking to my girls   honestly say, it never crosses my mind 
On my own with, with 
to think I wish he'd come back I get back to how life was cos I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole .
.
No, no .
Absolutely not for anything.
Oh life begins again and as I say I'm only forty two, it isn't that .
Oh crikey no, you're just beginning love
And erm, I'm sure after this .
I'd, I'd I'd got a four year old toddler and a and a eighteen month old crawler when, when I was your age.
Really?
Yeah.
Good lord.
Yes, so life had started again for me .
The bally down , bally down.
Except, that, except that of course I was doing everything for everybody.
Yes,.
No, help with anything, that was after the emergen emergency Caesar and everything .
Henry come back here  .
I'm, I think I had to do a days  .
, it's lovely.
Don't throw it too far otherwise .
The longer you throw, the more , good boy, it's so well hidden in the leaves, it's exactly the same colour that's the trouble this time of year, but no, life is a funny thing, and I find it personally very hard to believe that only two months ago, I mean what is it nine weeks ago, and I suddenly had an enormous  view
Yes,
and yet here you are ,
It knocks you on your heels doesn't it?.
absolutely .
I can see it, it knocked you back on your heels .
But you find that you can do things you've never dreamt of.
Yes.
You find out who your friends are.
Yes.
And erm, it's far from being the end of the world, and I think in a way 
Partly true, yes it is .
he's given me a life line, so jolly well it happened and enjoy life.
Well both my daughters are married to 
That's what I'm going to do ,
divorced men.
yes, and I sometimes think that way I know with Ken's two brothers the way they behaved with wife number one and the way they are with wife number two is a different world.
Hello love.
How are you?
Fine 
Are you 
and you?
steam and strimmer?
That's right, yeah.
Isn't it noisy?.
You've got a job here haven't you?
Do you wear 
.
Do you wear ear things?
Oh yeah.
Deaf pretty quickly.
Oh excuse us .
Yes you would , be careful he get's between your legs and goes .
Want to sing with a high pitched voice, you'll never have a better chance.
.
They both do that, Lucy and Henry both do that, shove their heads 
Lucy  ,
between your legs and go
yes they're both totally shame less and their heads are like that, Lucy come and see  say hello to .
mother who was the one they inherited 
Oh they ,
it from, so do be warned.
come away from the foxes please.
Rocket.
Come on away from the foxes, picks up any bits the foxes have left and then he get's an upset stomach and that's another thirty pounds at the vet.
That much is it?
Well, yes, once they have 
Oh it's horrendous isn't it?.
an injection and been back for a check up, yes it's a good thirty pounds, you can't step in the door really without  twenty five pounds.
No, yes, I think it's .
Even for their injections every year you know, and the, their worming twice a year.
I can understand if they take time on a stray dog  I often wondered if they realise 
He was , he was in the rescue.
what they're walking into,
Yeah.
the pet rules, were saying whether it's a pedigree  .
Oh well I've  it because I've had two pedigree's
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't be horrible ,
It's alright .
don't be horrible.
, right.
I think they were only talking.
Oh,oh thank you very much dog.
, good think I'm in my dog walker's .
And it was a white sweater, clean white sweater.
, it's an oldy.
I put on my old trouser's and welly boots this morning, it said it was going to be so messy .
Well I thought of my wellies and I thought, I was just worried about falling of the pebbles, mind you,safe as these.
I can only wear short ones otherwise they catch on the back of the driving seat and I don't like that.
It's horrible.
Anything that makes me,im impedes me, yes.
normal progress.
Yes, just happened at the wrong time.
Well this week I have to fly up to Liverpool on the early morning shuttle
Yes.
on Thursday, we go on a book buying expedition, every year, June and me, we choose a lot of books of , but it's a lot more fun to go and actually pick the things off the shelve 
Oh lovely .
and there's a library supplier, advertised to a box shop up in Lytham Saint Anne's
So it's all paid for.
oh yes,shuttle
Ah?
oh you'll love it, on the shuttle with the  representative of Midlands, the firm get's us the other end and drives up to, we spend all day hacking around  .
on the shelves there .
I didn't know they had a big library.
Oh, yes, it's a three million books, it's called Help Jackson, it's one of the very, very old  and that, I literally 
Oh so, the public is nothing .
three million books on the shelve, and we don't have time going properly at the price so we go  anything you want, bung it on the trolley and soon as the trolleys full it's taken away and another one given, and you poke around and then in the evening, you stay in a hotel overnight, and then the following morning, they get  and you just  sort of send up the money  and they just shout up the money as we go, then,every time I get to a thousand they say one, two, and you say right, tell me when I get near three,and I've got this erm, I'm dreadful at maths, I failed maths O Level three times and I  don't think about prices, I've never been more than fifteen pounds out .
Carry a computer .
I can't, you haven't got time.
No.
I've never been more than fifteen pounds out, at the end of the day  which is unbelievable.
Well, very good .
It's just  somewhere.
This is what the Government pay for?
This is all for provided for  Broadmoor.
For the, for the inmates of Broadmoor?
Yeah oh yes.
They have a, a life of Riley don't they?
Well, the trouble is that they've got a closed 
Think about it .
population, whereas in a public library there are people using the , some of  for life so therefore you can't even send  year in and year out they have to constantly changing
Huh, you have more sympathy for them than I do.
aha, ha.
My first sympathy is with the people that they're in there because of, if you see what I mean?
Hello love, I mean if they, if they were in cells without any books to read or televisions to watch I wouldn't have that much sympathy, my sympathy is with the little girls
Yes.
who've been left
Oh yes, I can understand that, but it's in the same way as 
assaulted in bushes ,
you don't hate someone, because they have to
oh no I don't hate them.
you don't hate someone cos they have Leukaemia, you can't really hate someone 
Oh no ,
who has schizophrenia, they're, they're because they've 
no ,
done something, because of the illness .
I feel sorry for them there, but for the grace of god, does anyone of us?
 
 
If they're sick in their heads , if they're sick in their heads and they have to rape little girls.
Mm.
But my first thought is for the little girls
Oh yes, I .
and I would stick a needle in their bottom while they were fast asleep, so they didn't wake up any more, just like you would with an animal that does that.
Mm, it's very easy to think that, until you know them as people, I must admit, there are ,
Yes, I can see your point ,
there is a hardcore, see, it's not necessarily what they've done, but when you meet them there's something instinctively repulsive about them
yes.
and not in, not necessarily the most seriousness, something the way they look at you
Yeah.
that to me is a hundred per cent unacceptable
Yes.
and you just think yuck
and you have to try and cover over, you can't say, god you're vile aren't you?, but erm,
Well I remember, so I used to talk to the nurses quite a lot when I walked Roxanna, my other German shepherd, in Wellington
Yes.
and quite a lot of the nurses used to walk their nurses, I mean they're er war trained and unarmed combat and they're wardens, let's face it, they're not nurses, and one of them was saying to me, oh we had a fellow in the other day, he'd, he'd a, fallen up the police stations steps I think erm, he said that he'd been to see the do gooders, he had this interview
Mm.
and he convinced them he didn't need an operation, he was, he was cured, he'd had his treatment,psy psychiatrist that seen him and he was all right thank you, he said, and they're so clever they can convince anybody on the outside 
Oh yes, yes .
Yes we ask a psychopath now why 
Exactly, and as they took him back to his room, not his cell, but his room, he turned to my, my mate who was with me and said er, I don't want an operation I like having sex with little girls, he said now I've got two little girls and I had to turn and walk away
mm.
I said I can understand, he said I had to turn and walk away because my fingers were itching
Yes, I find it a lot easier actually not to know what they've done, when you start work there you tend to come over these cases, which  to do
Yeah.
as much as anything, but it's only cos you're writing a letter, and you say oh hello you writing a letter to mum, he says no I killed her to come here, you don't put your foot in it a big way, but after a while because you know nobody there is nice it really makes a lot of difference  people
.
you don't think oh here comes a rapist, here's a sex offender, he's a whatever, just to take them as they come as people, because you've got to treat them all the same anyway
Yes, but this fellow you see, I said to him erm, you had a lot to do with that fellow, he'd, he'd been down to collect him from someone on the South Coast as well with a police of course, and I said what happened to the little girl? he said oh she's been in psychiatric care, care for four years
oh yeah.
and there's no chance of her, and she was shattered, her, her life was ruined .
Oh their life's can be totally wrecked, I don't doubt it for a moment.
But I didn't have much sympathy for the man who was 
There, there are those who it gives a  going out and 
Who's got a cigarette ration and his television ,
you think, oh my god, you know, I'll put loads of money on him,.
yeah, do you remember the one, two or three years ago who talked to do gooders, that he was, he was fine
and he was let out and first, within twenty four hours he'd gone down to the South Coast and killed his mother and his girl friend
Yes, oh yes.
just like that.
Yes, there are those who .
I mean I would, I would I'd stick a needle in their bottoms just like I would for a dog that had gone b , gone bad, I'd say poor creature can't help it
There are some, but then you see Ginny there's a girl in there .
I feel sorry for the victims 
There's a girl in there killed her daddy, but whey did she kill daddy, she killed daddy because 
Cos dad ,
he'd raped her and abused her from 
yes ,
the age of six and a half
well she shouldn't be in there .
Who's, who's the wrong one there?.
She shouldn't be in there.
She needs help.
She shouldn't be in there.
Exactly, but I mean I rest my case, there's, when you know their entire story, some of them, it makes you wonder who's more sinning against than sinning  it's a strange affair.
I think she had every right to .
Yes, so do I,.
Just to fight  .
But then future is hatred of men, she's likely to go out and kill every other 
Yes ,
man she comes across.
yes.
Your duties then is to protect the outside world and her from her health.
Yeah.
So I mean it, it's obviously a lot more sort of complicated as it seems on the outside .
take everyone individual .
Henry, come back you silly thing.
.
.
Come here and sit.
What a lot of walk for your fuel wasn't it?
Can't you get your van down?
It's a long walk.
.
You like suffering be honest, you like suffering.
You drove past me the other day when I drov , was it you?
When I


I did drive the other day, yeah .
When I whipped him , when I whipped him into the side just down there.
Yeah.
I heard this, this, a range rover coming ever so, ever so patiently behind me at walking pace, I suddenly realised there was something behind me.
Was that a Sunday morning walk  Ginny?.
a bit busier on the Sunday .
I think so, yes, yes.
Walked all around yesterday lunch time, didn't see a soul in the pla , I saw one, was it you, on the back meadow?
I wasn't there yesterday .
There was one chap in the green thingy, yeah.
Oh you're so butch and  Henry, bye, bye
Don't work too hard.
I'll see you, phone you one day in the week, I saw the post lady coming up the drive and I said to Henry who's that, he threw himself against the top window so there was indeed someone coming up the drive, tore into the dinning room, picked up his tennis ball, raced back to the window and wow, wow, wow , with his ball in his mouth, and I said Henry you're really going to frightened off intruders with a ball in your mouth, I said  .
Oh no , honestly he would, if there was strangers.
Yes, oh I'm sure he would, but I mean,.
Wow, wow, wow is enough , yes, he goes mad at the post, he drags it all across, all across the hall, all through the lounge.
.
Oh yes, I would too if they had one  .
, ring up the  and say sorry my dog ate it.
Yes.
.
Yes, oh Rocket, for the first few months I had him, after he was rescued, and he was so protective of me, because I'd given him a good home and never, never hit him in the face .
It's so  , take sides
No he goes up, he puts his ,
Is he yours?.
no put's his paws on Keith and wags his tail and says, hit me.
I'll take it.
I'll take, that's what he was  got used to you see 
Really .
Can't bear angry voices, first he used to go underneath the rocking chair
And hide.
and hide, now, even if Keith's arguing with the television, which he would, Politician, he'll still go up and put his paws up on his knee, wag his tail, and bury his head and say, hit me instead ,
Here I am , oh
I'm, I'm the punch bag
Oh painful.
and I'd call him 
Oh ,
and then give him a game and take his mind off it, and take him in the kitchen give him 
oh poor Rocket ,
a, give him a chew or a treat or something you know.
poor Rocket, god how awful.
Roxanna if ever, er god forbid, if ever he's raised his hand, Roxanna would have had him I think
Though she never did with you really because that, I  
Threatened her once or twice .
out the door like that  I'd put them out the door just like that .
yes.
You've got to .
Oh yes, oh yes, now he knows better.
Good.
Dinda's er trained him along,, well, a very good self defence.
Mm.
And she's had no hesitation, she'll .
Mm.
Absolutely.
Unbelievable.
She would knife him if she had too, and then of course she'd end up in Broadmoor,.
We'd love to look after her you see.
Yeah.
I use the word love very, very loosely, like be honest I don't think I  love, you can feel the  that love 
Yeah ,
is not one of the emotions.
I think there is sympathy erm for the people who are sick of course I can .
I think some, some of the illness are so devastatingly terrified, that you can only think thank god, not to have that, because it must be so frightening, unlike some of these  schizophrenia are hair raising
Yes,
but there are undoubtedly
Yes,
is the good, bad and the ugly in there
Yes,
and there are some who are on a very  trip from here to jail
Yes.
because if some of ours were in jail, they'd be killed.
Of course.
Sex offenders, and rape little girls, hurt policeman, they're not liked .
They always get beaten up .
They would never survive
Yeah, especially when it's their own little girl
never survive,
their own little children.
but some of them are repulsive
Yeah
I won't kid you, and it's very hard to say good morning John how are you, when you're thinking , and you're thinking you stay your side of  .
 
hand full always 
from the back of your , back of your necks going.
in the  you think please god don't let Joe Bloggs come out this morning, good morning Joe,first one out .
Yeah, yes.
Ball done then, ball done, ball done, that's have the last one, thank you .
Bally down, last time, throw the bally , last one.
Thank you.
Henry you're going the wrong way, as usual.
This way, it's more easier to see, not quite so many leaves.
Good boy.
Can't play cricket with a jacket on can you?
, good ball, you find it, where's Lulabelle gone?
Lucy!
Rocket!
Oh no .
They've taken each other for a walk, I think they, I think they're having a little flirtation, I think they're over there,
Lucy, I think I hear .
Rocket come,
Lucy.
Come.
Come here darling.
Come, come
Henry and Lucy Lu.
I'm glad to see you so happy and bright.
Oh I am, I'm ,
Enjoying your job ,
I'm not letting the bugger get me down that's for sure.
and, and if ever you think of it, just think Ginny would give her back, back teeth .
Do you know, it's a most peculiar thing, a number of people who said, erm, one of our  really made me laugh, a couple of Friday's ago, came and said to me, typical , Christ, he's done you a big favour hasn't he?
What you mean?
He said, it's bloody wonderful you said, it's taken years off you and I said thank you  .
It has, it has , it has.
It's not all bad Ginny, it really isn't, and a number of women who think, Christ  is alarming,you know.
Yes, yeah.
But now   .
Well to be quite , to be quite honestly sweety, I mean, I look at him and I think I'm not unfond of him
Mm.
He's the father of my three girls
Mm.
who's  in my life,
Oh yes, yeah.
and if it hadn't been for him I wouldn't have them,
Yes.
mind you, I'd have somebody else's.
your girls are your daughters
Yes, but you know for years, when they were growing up in their teens, I was the  the tennis net between him and his daughters, where's she going, who's she going with, who's bringing her home, is she wearing eye make up, why's she wearing nylons and not ankle socks ,
Oh no ,
I was always the buffer between the two, I used to say I agree with you dear, I don't want her to wear nylons, that's not the point, all her friends are wearing nylons and she's not going to be the 
that's right, do you want  
odd one out.
up on her own?
She's not going to feel the odd one out.
Mm.
It doesn't make much difference to us, we're not that hard up, that we can't afford
So you're really getting it all along the line aren't you?
until they left home, first of all it was I break his bloody neck taking advantage of my daughter, cos they each lived with their
Oh yeah.
boy, boy friends before, they married them, they weren't sleep, if they'd been sleeping around then I would of said something, then I would of said something to them ,
Something else, oh yes, yes .
but it was one man and they stuck to him, and they, they lived with them first and then they married.
Do you, honestly in this day and age I don't think that's a really bad thing, because until you're with someone all the time, who knows what, you'd never have got in, you'd never have gone in would you?.
Only too, god if I  lived with him first, I would never of married him, no, no, no way 
No.
No way, if I'd known him.
.
The whole courtship was a tissue of lies, you know.
Mm.
Where he lived, where, when he was born, where he was born, what his parents did
Really?
Everything was lies.
Can't believe him I really don't .
Complete lies , yeah.
.
Any way we'll continue this merry saga and put 
Yes .
the world's to right  weekend.
And now I had a lovely fellow I'd grown up with in the same village, the same sort of background, we'd known each other since we were eleven, twelve ,
Oh dear, where's he now?
he's still in love with me he says, in eh, working in Birmingham, living in Bristol.
.
Phones me up now and again, oh yeah, I'll have you.
Still dreams about me 
Well you never, ever know Ginny  
.
one day I'll tell you a story.
Met him in Stratford last summer when Dinda and I had a cottage ,
tell you a story ,
Dinda and I had a cottage in Stratford last, we made sure that father was going to Plymouth to Debbie's for the week, he said he adores it down there
yeah.
he didn't really like it, but he had a lovely week, but at least we didn't come back to a house that's full of
Oh absolutely.
full bedclothes and dirty crock.
Hello, hello, hello,.
.
She had, she had so many warnings
And I thought oh god
But he looks bright.
He went yesterday, I was gonna come up this afternoon and tell you when Peter came home, can't leave him, he was so naughty yesterday, he licked ,
Atten ,
he licked that, although 
yeah ,
she said he mustn't lick it.
yes he'll have to have a collar on .
I only went upstairs to get sort of washed and dressed, after the weekend, you have nobody around and er, oh eh, it started bleeding.
But it's natural for them to lick a wound.
It is, but it opens it up
Yes.
You see as it's quite nasty.
Cos normally they aren't stitched, they have to heal by nature
Yeah.
I suppose.
He erm
What a good boy aren't you?
and I thought oh what she gonna say, because he went yesterday afternoon
Yes.
and she said, I told you he had been licking, she said oh, even with the licking, that's excellent I'm very pleased.
Oh really has healed nice  .
And she said he's not out of the woods yet, but, I'll give you a collar, if he's naughty, very crafty,and then I looked through the crack in the door and his looking .
But how can he reach it with the collar on?
Well I
You've got the collar on back to front.
I know, because he can still reach it the other way round.
Oh, it should be .
Yes, I did, I put it on that way
And he could reach?.
And he could, see he's got a little .
It's so long isn't it?.
Yes, this is it, you see, I don't think she thought of
Cos it's a .
Yeah, and even if, even
Got long under carriage, haven't you darling.
mummy he's still licking,I thought what am I gonna do?
So, I put it on the other way round this morning and he hates it, I've only just done it
Oh they do hate it.
and he, he can't get round there  .
At least he can see , I mean Roxanna 
Yeah ,
had to have one for a short while, she was quite young and I, we'd only just moved here and I took her to the vet the used to be in Sandhurst, they said it was a bee sting, they put purple stuff on it
oh.
It didn't get any better and somebody told me about  and I took her down there, oh Mrs  she's picked up mange, I said mange, I know she said you feel just like when your child's got nits in their hair
Yeah
don't worry, it's, it's in the grass and she's just picked it up in the heat wave.
So to stop it  cos she always used to clear the foxes from the top garden, but er, because she worried it, it was about there on her patch
Oh yes, a niggle .
a bald patch , yes, so she had wear, actually we had to cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog
Oh yeah.
cut down a plastic bucket and fixed that, it was great she had a bucket round her, round her
Oh she'd only do that when 
thing .
I sort of popping upstairs, when I'm here, I'll take it off him, but just now he, he was walking along like 
Let him get used to it.
as though he could walk, but when you came to the door, here .
Yeah, yeah, he'd forgot all about it, didn't he, he was putting it on you see.
, yeah, yeah, this is it.
They don't half get you at it, don't they?
They do, they, they could wear you out.
But he's eating well going to the loo alright.
Good, I, I thought of you following him around watching what he was going to do.
Oh my dear I was, it, you sort of feel exhausted with the worry of it don't you?
Yes and the
And the strain.
Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel, when she did the operation
Yes.
so there would of been nothing there for him to go for, you must of been ever so worried following him around watching him .
I was , because I, I felt oh, if it all comes to pieces it's all gonna bleed
Yes.
but he was alright and he didn't strain cos he couldn't go
Mm.
.
Was there any way he
And he's eating it alright.
Oh good.
I, I just put it on his dinner, cos there's no way that I squirt it in his mouth, I'd probably choke him.
Yeah, yeah.
I just put it on his dinner and he, he's licking all his bowls clean
Oh good.
so, that it's working.
So he's not off his food, that's a good sign.
No.
He's certainly alert, that's why I didn't want to ring the bell ,
Yeah ,
so that he wouldn't upset himself by barking, that's why I tapped on the window when I saw you.
.
There Herbie.
What a good boy.
Yeah, you're still not having  he says ,
What a good boy ,
but he's quite bright eyed .
he's aged , he's aged round he's eyes.
Yeah, ten and a half years old.
Your .
It doesn't seem that long since you had him as a puppy 
I know .
use to keep
This is the thing.
keep Lancer company.
Yeah, you did you perked Lancer up a treat didn't you?
Is there any way she can tell what's going on inside, where she did all the reconstruction.
I suppose is the only way if, if he started bleeding or if he felt loose, cos she said he's still swollen from the operation
Yes.
obviously, but he's, he's gone down, I, I can see he's gone down a little bit
Yes.
I mean before he was all loose and baggy
That's right, he was.
Were erm, where he had  .
And then of course he hasn't, he hasn't got testicles any more.
No.
But she's, so it's difficult to judge isn't it?
Yes, yes.
Cos you don't know how much she took away when she took the testicles out.
No, he I mean he, he still got the little 
They're partly inside, they're partly outside 
a little bag, but there's nothing in them .
Yes, yes.
.
She did a marvellous job.
Yes, a  nurse came round and she said hello Herby, she said oh you look quite bright, and I said did he play you up she said well he was very torn and I thought yeah I'm sure he was .
Oh poor little soul , of course he was.
in all night.
Is he getting treats, is that why's he's looking
No, I, I only give him his food .
So that he get's a treat .
Are you not getting any treats?
And he's bowl of water.
I nearly brought you down and treat, and I thought I'd better not until I've asked your mum.
Yeah, he has had a bonio, he likes a bonio, he did eat one last night,
Well that's only
he usually has a bonio after he's dinner 
a food supplement isn't it?.
this is it, but that's his sort of  
Rocket has a chew usually .
Oh yeah, got those.
You know one of those hoof and horn chews
Yeah.
Which there's nothing in them, there's noth , not fattening or anything.
That's right.
I mean I never have given my dogs chocolates or anything like that, a lot of people do .
You now, he, he's had  , I'm just keeping him on the straight and narrow while he's on remission .
Yes, oh yes .
.
Yes, got to keep your insides in motion we have darling.
, she said he must not strain, and I've been petrified 
I remember she was, she was ever so adamant about that.
she said straining is going to push the stitches
Yes
Yes.
but as soon as he start, get ready, go, and I go up to Lisa's and .
And he tells you when he wants to go, or is it regular times of the day?.
Well he looks all peculiar .
Yeah.
, I suppose like this morning after his breakfast, and he went and he, he, it was quite big
Good.
So erm, I was pleased.
Good, so it's forming into a proper form.
Yeah.
Proper shape.
Oh yes.
But it's sliding with the, the liquid paraffin.
It comes out quite good.
Good, good, if it's forming properly that's a good sign isn't it of health, always.
Yeah, cos, when he had he's hernia he, he's it used to come out flat.
Yes.
There's nothing there ,
Depressed ,
you see, it's gone like that.
yes.
So erm,round his bottom and it's all round know, and I keep looking for signs of bleeding and all this .
Oh that's good, that means , that means their anal passage and his rectum were in the right shape again.
That's right.
Oh I'm so glad.
Oh I hope so, but  still not out of the woods yet 
Erm, well no I suppose he won't be until he's erm, had stitches out, she said it would be two weeks
Mm.
before we, you know, could really stop worrying.
Mm, mm.
But, she said I'm pleased with him so far, but we still got to be careful that's why she made him have this collar.
Well remember I'm usually around, if I'm not there 
Thank you Ginny ,
the first time you ring, I'm usually only out long enough to walk the dog and do some shopping
right.
so don't hesitate to call if you get worried about him or
Alright, yeah, thanks very much.
You know if he starts throwing up or well you, you think he seems he looks as if he's in pain or something.
Yeah, but she said he's alright and erm  I said he's he was jumping on the chair, should he ought to?
.
He's, he's, he's jump, he, he, he goes up like a jump jet he goes 
Yeah.
like that, and she said oh, she said well I'm rather pleased to think that he feels likes doing it.
Of course.
.
well that's the only way he can see out the window 
Yeah.
he likes to watch doesn't he?
Yeah.
I often see him watching as I go by.
That's right, he usually sits up there, and I'm, not going to leave him on his own till I know he's alright.
But erm, she said don't worry too much about jumping, she said I'm quite pleased you know he can do that
Yeah.
she said it's just straight .
So she gave him more liquid paraffin did she?
No I've still got the  bottle 
Yes, it's easy enough to get it  get the empty bottle and
Yeah, I've got some up there any way, I'm sure that 'll be alright to use.
I suppose
So
I suppose it's the same strength where ever you buy it.
Well I can check on the bottle.
Yeah.
.
Any way I'm going Thursday, if I need any more she'll give me some then.
You've got someone to take you Thursday?
Yes, cos I couldn't get there till five o'clock  .
I'll take it off when I come down stairs and you can go to sleep.
Yes I couldn't get an appointment until just gone five, so Pete will be, thanks Ginny.
But erm, it's really, not only, when you look at it, it makes me cringe, I think ooh, he licked it yesterday and it was all bleeding, and it, you know,
Well the stitches are pulling where they're, where they're trying to heal of course, they're pulling.
Yeah, and with he's licking he's make it all soft and
That's why he's licking cos it must itch like made.
.
.
.
What a good boy, I would of thought she'd have put something on it, put some ointment on to stop it itching .
And the other side is quite dry , yeah, that is the side he keeps on  but that's quite erm dry.
I use Savlon ointment on any, any of mine.
Oh I do.
Savlon .
.
anything, yes.
That's what I used on Rocket's tummy, when he done, got that had a G two cortezone bathed him with Savlon
Oh yes.
warm water, and then put Savlon cream on it, vet said you couldn't have done any better, cos he gave him an antidote, before I new what it was I would have given him funny itching rash that was making the poor soul
Yeah
itch and
that drives you made, if you've got an itch yourself 
Oh yes ,
it's ooh.
oh yes, yes.
Well I shall leave you to get on with it, go and put my washing out and go and unload my shopping.
Yeah, thank you ever so much Ginny .

Yeah, is he better?
Erm, well it's still there a bit, but it's not, it's not too bad, he's moving around more easily now.
Yeah.
But after all I mean, he's put in new plumbing, he's put in a new boiler, all the plumbing, he didn't pull his muscles at all, he went to pick a light carton out of the back of a car, twisted his
twisted.
yeah, bottom of his spine.
Painful.
Mm, you can do it so, the worst one I ever did was just filling a kettle of water and turning round to put it on the, on the cooker .
Oh yeah, it's  .
Yeah, and I came, for three weeks I was coming down stairs on my bottom like a toddler, I couldn't go from 
Where you, yeah .
one step to another and the hospital, the hospital and I went up to Maidenhead hospital and they said don't stretch, don't bend, don't lift, don't carry and I said thank you I've got a school girl, a toddler and a new baby, and I didn't bother to go back any more

Well not that.
It's just that you know it might do some good.
Well you feel more confident with the  Cos you, you have improved your posture.

I'm just trying to improve my posture.
I know my posture's .

No I was huddling because I'm lazy.

No, it wasn't spicy it was just so tasty
almonds.
There's everything in this pie, there's almonds 
You could put you could put courgettes in.
I love courgette.
Yeah?
Well I had to have something to perk it up and  vegetables are getting a bit iffy at this time of year.
I think courgettes are wonderful.
I could have courgette and  and aubergine.
Mm.
There's celery and onion and leek.
And nuts.
There's more out there in the kitchen.
Mm.
Go and get half of it.
I like it better with not so much ginger I think.
Yeah.

I like it better with not quite so much ginger as last week.
Cos I remembered the 
I asked her to slack off on the ginger a bit 
the garlic.
the number of people that are trying to get towards this sort of diet that I'm on.
Really?
Well, national thing last night.
Yes  yes.
It's a good thing.
Perhaps the shops'll make it easier for us now.
More stuff available.
You've got Solihull in Surrey.
.
I'm not from Surrey.
I was born and bred in Berkshire.
That's right 
Wasn't I?
I was born in Berkshire.
Yes.
and bred in Berkshire.
in Berkshire.
Your  is in Berkshire.
So I think I'll route for Solihull.
Your  is in Berkshire.
You were born in
Berkshire.
Buckinghamshire.
 
Berkshire.
It was Berkshire then.
You were born in Taplow.
You're quite right.
I beg your pardon.
 
Taplow, Bucks.
Yes.
It was  it was Berkshire.
No it wasn't.
It never was Berkshire.
Wonder what it says on my birth certificate.
I'll have to go and have a look at it.
I've got my birth certificate with me.
Taplow, Bucks.
Mm.
That's right.
We were in just over the border.
But postal wise we were in Maidenhead Berkshire.
But for the rates and the schools we were Buckinghamshire.
saying that we are in Surrey now.
We're not in Surrey.
We're in Berkshire.
But we're not in Surrey, are we?
No we're in Berkshire.
Saying we were in Berkshire is like saying we're in Surrey now.
Same old thing.
This is not true.
We are in the postal  in Surrey.
The analogy's the same.
Quite right.
Big words coming out now.
It's not 
 
We've got that  up there and it tells you  cos he's in trouble.
 

Oh  there's a bit left.
Do you want it?
No thank you dear.
Do you want any more Dind?
No thanks.
That was jolly nice.
I had a light lunch.
Yes.
You haven't had much filling stuff have you?
I didn't have any any  any almonds for my lunch .
Well will you have a  slice of low fat cheese?
Slimmers cheese.
and you haven't eaten that much and a vegetarian pie isn't
Yes it is.   potatoes.
Well I know it's got potatoes but it's not that filling.
And there's only fruit you see for afters.
That's alright.
Well it soon went, that lot.
Didn't it?
Mhm.
About two hours preparation for about ten minutes eating.
.
What did you say?
Well you can't say  enjoyment.
About two hours preparation for  ten minutes eating.
I thought all cooking was like that.
Which was I  
That's true.
Very true.
You don't ever keep the pineapple juice?
Only orange.
Not much call for it.
No.
No.
We've never had we've never had pineapple juice.
Robert won't sort of get it in he said because it's so slow going.
Yes.
We've got one white or one brown.
One white.
Seventy seven pence then.
Oh.
You don't need two  I suppose?
No.
Thank you very much.
No.
There's not a lot of .
Not as cold  not as cold yet as I thought it was going to be.
No?
Other people have been saying it's colder, colder than they thought.
Well yesterday I thought it was.
Yes.
.
Get them Rock.
Rocket.
Rock.
Rocket.
Hello baby.
Hello.
Hello.
very lucky if she'll give it to you.
. I haven't trained her yet.
Hello darling.
Come and say hello.
There's a love.
Can't be left out can she?
 

And bouncy there gets all the fuss doesn't she because she's so  she's so full of life.
But your an old love.
Look at her .
Yeah.
You're always dopey aren't you?
Eh?
Oh she 
Suppose she's nice cos she's handier, don't have to bend down,
That's right.
Yes.
Sally!
Now stop it.
Gosh  end of the walk.
You should be tired.
Ah.
Well I'll have to have it if I want to throw it.
No she  this is what she does.
She wants you to chase her.
I can't chase you I'm far too old.
Ha  got it.
about three sticks on the way round so when we get here I've got one to throw.
As she brings up one I've got another one to throw and she drops what she's got.
And this is how we're going .
She's been playing with the .
I thought well that's good
Yes.
she doesn't need the extra  belting around.
Are you limping?
Erm  my arthritis is playing me up this week.
Ooh.
Don't know why.
Whether  what's caused it.
Cold?
A chill?
My other knee got bad all of a sudden.
I mean I only had one bad knee but then this time I got two.
Oh that's rough.
It is .
Sal!
Sally .
You do not  
I'll squeeze your paws.
I will.
I'll squeeze your paws.
Now I keep trying that with you.
oops    Might be the weather.
I don't know.
Have you strained?
I did  gardening.
Oh.
Digging.
Could have been that.
Yes.
Finds your weakest spots doesn't it?
It sure does.
I'm not supposed to dig.
Aren't you?
Not really no.
Cos it aggravates the hip.
Yes.
what annoys me cos I love gardening.
I used to do, well I, I still do all, all the gardening that gets done.
I used to spend hours gardening.
That's what I like.
You go out there and you don't realize how long you've been out there.
No.
No you don't.
I don't do so much now.
I'm more a fair weather gardener.
Well I keep going out there trying to  keep the leaves down.
That's impossible round here.
Well we've got an oak out the front  and I've swept, I've got two bags .
Oh I can imagine.
The rest I've put in the gutter  off the path and of course the wind's blown them all back off again.
Yes.
Yes.
It's funny whichever way the wind blows  my back door and my front door both get covered with leaves.
Yeah.
I want 
It's magic.
really a continuous, strongish wind  to blow in one direction for quite a few hours.
It may blow them all into one spot.
Yes.
Never happens like that though does it?
We've got one corner of the garden out the front and if the wind's in the right direction it neatly puts them all together.
Oh that's 
Cos the wall stops them.
And they're much easier to pick up that way.
That's right.
.
But she's still got a load of leaves on her, the old oak.
There's still a lot more to come.
Yes.
Oh yes there are.
I saw a gadget the other day in a magazine.
It was just like two dustbin lids.
Pick up a heap of leaves at one point.
Oh yeah.
I thought well you could use dustbin lids instead of sending of ten pounds to get two of their pieces of  
I use my dust pan.
Yes.
Yes.
I do.
Because that's smashing for just scooping up.
Yes.
And you can hold them with a  with a brush or the broom.
Well I scooped it up and I got  there.
You can always
Yeah.
always wear rubber gloves anyway.
So often I just scoop a  to put in.
And I even use it when  I wanna shift snow.
I just, if it's a light snow 
Yes.
That's a good idea.
I just scoop it up with that.
I found it a lot easier .
I mean I bought a lovely wide broom.
I thought oh that'll be smashing for the snow just sweep 
It's hard work.
And of course you do about a yard and then you're stuck.
You can't move.
No I find the best thing for snow cos  we've got an eight car driveway so you can imagine how much
Yeah.
That's like we have to.
snow I have to shift.
I get a thin, long board and use that.
It's definitely easiest.
As long as the board itself isn't too heavy.
Well this is it.
I have to, cos with the  with the pan although I'm bending, it's, it's not too bad because it's not too heavy for me.
Yes.
Well I get a board about here  and just walk and push.
Oh right.
It's alright, somebody had their windsc erm window smashed yesterday.
I know.
A gentleman stopped me as I was coming back and he said  do you own a white Austin Metro.
And it's funny because the last car that I saw the fellow's from  I saw the fellow's who did it.
Oh you did?
And got their car number.
Yes.
Oh you have?
And the police came and interviewed me about it.
That was a white Austin Metro.
Don't think it's the same young woman.
He said oh the car's been broken into 
No because it was funny cos we were talking  to the lady.
She's got a red setter.
And  she'd just arrived.
And she apparently .
She said, do you know she said we'd gone off to the woods and I suddenly  remembered I'd left my purse in the car.
Oh no.
She said so I went back and got my purse.
She said now  apparently they've got a horse somewhere round here and she said when she came back there was this car about half hour later after they'd left here  a car been broken into.
She said er it makes me wonder if I'd left my purse in the car if it had of been our car that might have been dumped.
Yeah.
Well  they'd gone off and before  Anthea had gone and I was still fiddling about getting the windows clean.
This car drew in there and a chap got out and I thought, what dog's he got?
You know  
That's what I always think.
I look for the dog or the jogging suit and if they haven't got a dog or a jogging suit  I think what are they up to?
Well see he, he was quite tall and when he got out he was a bit scruffy looking, and his shirt was hanging out below his jacket.
Yes.
And he got out  I can't see any dog .
But he walked very purposefully erm straight up there and then I noticed he'd got a hook
Yes?
instead of a right hand.
That's useful for breaking into things isn't it?
And I, and I thought to myself  oh no perhaps he's legitimate.
He's just going for a walk .
No it's odd.
But it's a maroony  dirty maroony  and black I think it was car.
And it was a W M X, the letters were.
Didn't you tell the police?
You should give them a ring and tell them if you saw a strange man.
Well yeah I did I mean he disappeared from sight whereas the others
Well he would if you were waiting around here.
Of course you look as though 
Ah I dunno.
One morning when I came here there was a car arrived here and it was a  a dirty yellow one and thr two women and a bloke got out all dressed in  black jeans and black jumpers.
Yes.
So I thought now that's odd.
They didn't look the sort to go  for a ramble 
perhaps.
And they come out and they sort of were looking around  and there was a load of cars here.
And I thought I don't like the look of that.
Mm.
So I was standing there and I thought to myself pretend I'm looking at my watch and I'm waiting for someone.
Yes.
And they hung about and hung about and then they came across here, looked at the board and they kept turning round and looking where I was.
And I was still hanging there.
Then they walked down there, but not out of sight  of the cars.
Then they came back, read the notice board again.
I must have been there about five or ten minutes?
neat haircuts?
They looked quite  quite presentable.
One woman was very fat.
And I still stood there so I got in the car and wrote the number down.
Good for you.
Cos I thought I'm never gonna remember it.
And eventually they got in and went off.
But they were, they kept on looking at me to see if I was gonna move and I thought I'm not gonna move till you move.
Mm.
Cos the fact that they only went down there, came back and were milling around  waiting I wouldn't have been a bit surprised cos the car was a filthy old car.
You should have told you should have told the police.
Any car number you can 
They hadn't done anything.
No.
But any car number you can get if they're acting suspiciously please tell them.
That's what they keep telling me.
Oh I see.
Cos they had er 
Because they came and interviewed me.
If you see anything suspicious.
The last time I phoned up I said  the bicycle that was hidden in the bushes.
Obviously been stolen.
Down there  that erm Davey  and I found together.
His dog erm found it, you know Sam?
Erm  next day it was still there  although he'd phoned the police.
So I phoned them up in the afternoon and I said the bicycle that  my friend Mr  reported yesterday afternoon is still in the bushes.
I said and I have a feeling that there was somebody there watching me  I could feel it.
I said and as I came back up what I call the straight path parallel with the road there were two men loitering in the bushes against the car park.
Oi!
Both very well dressed.
Jeans, but clean and spruce and I said  I have a feeling they could have been police.
And he burst out laughing and said you're quite right madam, they were police.
No these didn't give me the feeling of being police.
No.
But there's one I thought how stupid.
It's alright to park erm a non police car but there was a policeman actually sitting in the car while two of them loitered in there.
They were obviously staking out the place.
But while there's a man sitting respectably in a car no-one's gonna break into the other cars.
I know.
Not if they're witnessed, are they?
No I mean because I mean erm
So the other police should have gone into the other  should have gone away somewhere.
I didn't  I didn't cotton on to these two er these three.
And yet you feel uneasy?
Erm  it was the way they sort of checked all the way round the car park as if they were looking to see which would be the best.
And I mean they did get out and have a little mooch around the car park.
Yes.
And I thought to myself no I'm not gonna go out, I did start to go out the park and I thought no.
Yeah.
I'm like you.
Because  what if  they do break in.
Perhaps I'm, I'm misjudging but perhaps  what if they did, how would I feel?
Yes.
So I thought no I'll wait and see.
Oh you should give the police that number.
Just to be on the safe side.
I've lost it now cos I've chucked the matchbox out.
Oh what a shame.
But it was a yellow car and it had like soft toys and that in the back.
Yes.
On the back window ledge.
Yes.
Cos I thought to myself well I'll never remember the make of car.
I mean I'm, I'm hopeless with cars.
But I thought to myself oh you do  you do look suspicious.
And then I was talking to somebody about this and  they and they burst out laughing and said well we've got a friend, a male friend   a mate of mine he said and he loves walking.
Yes.
He said and what he often does  is because he lives over this area.
He'll often cut through  this way to go over to Wellington into  Crowthorne and walk all the way round.
Yes.
He said he often walks through the woods on his own.
I had to laugh.
He must forgive us ladies  do a sidestep .
He said he is legitimate.
He just loves walking.
Oh yes.
But the police would much rather you told them  when there's no
Yes.
nothing to be  nothing wrong with it than that you didn't tell them and there might be something wrong with it.
Oh I'll have to keep my eyes open.
Cos I thought well the couple had only just walked up there and I thought to myself oh well  he might meet up with them, you know.
The young, the young officer who came to me he said  of course we're so glad you got the number, you're quite right it's a car that's been doing the same thing in Wokingham.
We only know that they live somewhere in the Wokingham area.
It's lads who earn their living at this.
Yeah, yeah.
They go from car park to car park.
He said er but of course the thing is they don't expect elderly ladies  to notice their car numbers and remember them.
Now I may not remember always the make  first glance off unless I look at it.
But this was an eastern European car so they didn't expect me to know the make.
But I do remember numbers.
Oh I've got a terrible memory.
And I scratched it on there to make sure that I didn't forget it.
Oh I see.
And as soon as I got home I wrote it down.
I put it on there with my key.
# or whatever it was.
It's probably still there now.
It is  it's still there.
. It's still there.
Oh this was  this was  er W M X.
I remembered that because  what did it remind me of?
W M X. 
Like a B M X bike I expect.
Yeah or a volk volkswagen or something.
Mm.
Something clicked as I looked at the number.
Yes.
It's like with a lot of number plates.
Sometimes it  oh that's so and so's.
Yes.
I mean a lot of mine I can't even remember me own number plate.


But I .
No I went back and got in the car and was fiddling about and I wrote it down on a matchbox you see.
Yes good idea.
But the funny thing is by the time I got home I still remembered it.
Yes.
Cos you'd written it down.
If you hadn't written it down you wouldn't have.
No.
Er this is, I mean I've just got that way.
I thought to myself well if I don't write it down now  cos that's why I got back in my car.
You should have told the police  they'd have been interested.
Oh well then, another time then I'll remember that.
Cos you see I said why, why can't you trace the car?
I mean the number's quite, I said you, you reaffirmed that the number was the same one that had been doing the same thing in, in Wokingham.
He said  the car belonged to an elderly lady in Wokingham.
We've traced it that far.
She had sold it and she hadn't told the erm Swansea people, you know?
Yeah.
The vehicle licensing people.
It's so easy to just write the slip  and say I've sold my car to mister so and so.
I always do it.
Erm  and then that person she'd sold it to she knew their address.
They went to him and he had sold it as well and they couldn't
Yeah cos since they've done away with the log book.
And it hadn't been registered.
Where you used to have to send the 
Exactly.
log book in and it would come back.
It hadn't been registered so they'd got, the police have got no way of tracing it.
No.
Except keep driving round Wokingham looking for it.
I mean they  at least they could pick you up cos they'd had the log book.
Yes.
In the old days.
Yeah.
It was good wasn't it?
Yeah.
And each car they knew where they were didn't they?
That's right.
And the previous owner and the previous owner.
That's it.
Cos it was all written down.
Yes.
Oh all these  barred stuff.
They've got everything on computers now and it doesn't work half the time does it?
Well it's only as good as the person putting it in.
Yeah too true.
That's what they used to say.
Still  human error.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Until you get a computer for computing a computer.
Yes.
With a mind of it's own.
An intelligence.
That's what I mean.
Then that's frightening.
Yes.
It is isn't it?
Oh I couldn't take that.
Well.
I love your accent.
Where do you come from?
Me?
Originally  London.
Chiswick.
I wouldn't  don't hear any London.
Erm  well  sometimes it might come out is a bit of Devonshire.
Devonshire?
Yes.
That's what it is.
I only spent six years of my childhood there during the war years.
Well I can hear it.
It's a lovely soft  soft accent.
Oh thank you.
Very proud of being Devon 
Yes.
from Devon.
Yes.
I expect, cos when I came back from there nobody could understand me.
Oh.
When I went back to London.
My youngest daughter's there now.
Plymouth.
Well outside of Plymouth.
Little village.
Yeah I was at Dartmouth.
Yeah it's lovely isn't it?
Oh it was gorgeous.
After I was there for six years
Yes?
I wouldn't come home.
I can, I can hear it softly.
It's beautiful.
I like it.
I just wouldn't come home.
My mum tried bribery, everything.
I hated Lon er, well Chiswick it was sort of 
I hate London.
Chiswick, Acton.
Oh I.
Mike's witnessing his signature what he's already done.
two of them though.
Yes, but one of them I'll sign in your presence  Maisie and her twenty year old son , not hundred per cent happy about it, I'd prefer older people cos youngest like that are inclined try to put their music on a bit loud or invite their friends in when mum's away, you know, and .
No, no, they complain to us because  so does the secretary, I mean they're all very nice, they know us and they like us, talk to them when we go there, but any sign of a noise, somebody I'll be on the phone to me.
Well that's hope .
Yes, I hope he is, she's  apparently, she's erm a designer and the girl that makes it she designs the latest beautiful hats  and I thought to myself if they're those tall, biggest, you know those tall sort of round sort of like bowler hats,
Oh yeah.
I, I, remember something,cos I thought they'd look awful stuck on the top of their heads, they weren't sort of like
.
yes, yes, oh maybe they're hard
Probably hard.
yes, yes
.
You can put your lunch in,.
.
.

Oh lovely.
.
Cos there was something about it in the Best magazine wasn't there?

Oh yes  or have it slide tied, you weren't allowed to have hair that's not .
Oh no, no, oh it had to be tied in yeah.
And I was always saying to the girls at school for heavens sake keep your hair back, it's only  bunches, whatever, back  when they was younger they always had plait or bunches,.
Yes.

Yeah, that's right, yeah ,
You can't tell a .

Better, yes, better than erm, some, in the old days when you used to take those photo's they used to be awful didn't they, erm, everybody sort of look's as if they were staring and sort of all
Yes, yes,
Red eye
.
Ah, what you doing down there? ah
.
Aha 
.
Oh I've done about four, but we were having trouble with  he want's some books he likes books, but won't give us a clue and   
You could give him a book token let him do his own  .
Well that's a good idea , the thing, you see the thing is she says oh, we, I read anything, you know, buy anything, well I said well suppose you've already got it, you know, it's erm, and also we offered him some, some author's names so he didn't like this, and he didn't want that, you see, so, erm, but, in one hand he's saying buy me anything and the other hand he's saying I don't like this and I don't like that
Yes, yes that's right, yes.
For a few hours.
Yeah, Yeah, you've got
Do you think that's true?
Yeah, would you, but a couple of years because John was busy he bought us all tokens, erm, he bought the others tokens from Woolworths and me token from a body shop and we all,and I we had great fun looking and seeing what we wanted to buy with, with the book tokens, er, maybe, maybe I mention it providing we can't find anything.
It's  pleasure of going around  .
Yeah , and, and looking themselves, yeah.
The other thing he mentioned for his birthday was, would you believe, was a shirt with  er, with sleeves that you can put erm cuff links in, would you believe?
He said I've not been able to get one, and I went to  he said I thought with an old 
.
Yeah, quite often they do don't, well they used to I don't know if they do .
.
Yes, but erm
.
No, no, cuff links look nice don't they?
And I said to Polly they must make them, yeah 
The only thing you can do is .
Yeah.
Polly's got some nice ones, yeah, yeah.
.
Yeah  got some nice one's
I get .
Yeah.
.
Yes, I think they're  for myself,.
.
Yes, that's right, I see, but I said to him we'll try Alder's and the Army & Navy  But I 
shirts even if they're only Marks & Sparks  .
Yes, I've got yeah I know they did, but I think after a while they stopped doing that I think the latest ones you'll find don't, don't do that, they gave, you know, after a while they gave that up, but I, I must check on that, I must check on .
if he wears a long sleeve shirt, as soon as he takes his jacket off, he won't go around with his shirt  
No ,
roll his sleeves up.
roll his sleeves up, yeah Tom's like that, yes .
Even  ,.
Yes, yes, well I mean, that's, that's, if, I mean if we can get him one for his birthday that, get the problem of our shoulders sort of thing, that's his then, then he, he has to take his .
We .
Yeah.
Yeah.
, what can you give him a .
Well that's a good idea, as you say, erm, oh I must put .
I mean it could be a bottle of Gin 
Oh he's not.
.
He was doing so well for three months.
When he saw the 
Yes.
and he said you're .
Yes, that's right, after three months, yes, and he did that?
Yes.
Oh, and he's still, he's going to do that right up to Christmas?
But he won't eat the meat with potatoes
No.
the only time he has meat he has to have green salad or maybe a raw vegetable salad.
Yeah.
But I mean , yeah, yeah
, calorie  and then for another meal he'll have  he'll have this other stuff with a 
Mm.
he can't .
No, no,doesn't it?
.
Yeah, well John always swore by a  diet whether he  I don't know.
That thing I got, you know the Raptou use to
Oh yes, yes,
help me with the vegetables, all the vegetables, I get so tired chopping
yes
I don't think it's gonna work, I .
Oh why's that Iris?
It, it, looked alright, I, you know doing it on the telly, it did everything they said.
But  didn't see it on the telly, only saw it on the .
Oh it was on quite a lot.
Sorry I've .
Oh no,interest.
Why do you think it won't work?
This I read .
Oh, that's
.
My  are like that, going from the
oh er, he said I've taken, taken them out,
Have you tried it?
No.
I haven't even  it.
Oh.
I looked at the illustration and I thought no way is that ever going to do any thing that chops
Yeah, it
it never slice, or make chips
oh it, they showed you pictures of things coming out the squares
Yes,chip .
.
Doesn't take a chunky chop does it?
.
Well how can it, because it, it, I think it's got to go through the thing here, if you see what I mean, it, it, the chop you'd have to push it through a little bit and then have a,
Yeah, a blade.
a, yeah,.
What's that then?plate, oh I don't
Oh that's the thing that you put behind it.
She could use that without putting .
What, what, what, how can you stop it, how, how, how can you ,.
Got to .
bigger than .
But I can't see any thing here .
Push .
.
.
That sliced then, that is slicing,, nothing's got to stop them haven't they?
The fact that you've come to the end of the   the .
I can't think of any thing that would be of
It .
Now all I can think of doing is pushing it, you can push the turner things into chips then you've only got to chop them one way if you see what I mean, like erm, well is it worth these doing anything else?
But why ,chop.
I mean, what else would you use it for?
Do you use it to slice? or to grate? or to erm
No.
use the grate  like things like .
Aha.
.
I think that's why the , it looks like it.
I  I think brass is .
I've got a  oh, I've got a great big chip machine .
I was a bit disappointed.
Well, yes, I must admit still I still chop 
But there's nothing in there to say it's from  there's nothing on the box to say it's.
Well  
Could you be bothered getting that out unless you're prepared  wash all, all the bits afterwards.
 

, I'm sure it's  somebody else .
Yes.
I do because 
Yeah, somebody else .
Well
What did you say .
Yeah, you, you, get a, a thing on, ah there you are.
I thought, I thought it's .
Usually they give you a, a thing to return it, you know, a thing that you don't want it ,girls let you take the orders down  the ware house, oh,put the  return it too cos the, cos there's nothing in there.
I,.
You can buy those things that you push down on the top like that, and you
I thought that you can have one of those  that you roll side by side
.
It's like a knife but it's curved and it's got a 
.
Yes, you just rock it backwards and forwards.
Oh 
,.
I don't know, you .
Ah, again, it might, it might .
I've, I've got a little knife, I don't know where I got it from, on it, on it, it says  steel and it's all broken the blade because, you know, it's been used so much and it's sharper for even being broken than any thing else I've got.
Great.
Yeah, I don't know where I got it from ,
,
no, heaven knows what will happen to me when I've, when I got it any more, I use it all the time.

Yes that's right  if you don't want them , yes.
Shelve dividers, that's what he'll want .
Oh you got some shelve dividers
Yes, keep his socks out of Dinda's knickers.
.
I used to have a piece of cardboard up there  shelve dividers sounded like a good idea.
Mm.
It wasn't, it wasn't bad either because they're only four ninety nine
Mm.
one set, I think there's four in a set.
Is that  
Curiosity
Oh is that .
curiosity shop, looking like  big letters at the top
Mm,.
but that, that is .

yeah, yeah 
ribbons and things
it does, but there you are.
Oh but it's they go straight into a the bin
Yes, that's right.

Yes.
this year, at least were saving some of the trees then.
Yeah, I, I bought  generally .
Oh what a good idea.
loads of it.
I've got a load of it.
Mm.
Got a load of it, still upstairs from last year,.
Mm, well it always, I mean it's the sort of thing keep .
Well usually I don't buy enough, so then I go out and buy another package of it ,
Mm ,
and that is too much.
mm, and I've sort of.
so have I.
.
.
Give it to .
Yes     I've done it, I've ordered, ordered it from Katie , bunch of spring flowers, I know she loves flowers, and, and it'll, it'll give some   not very big are they?
What's that?
Your drawer dividers.
Mm, shelve divider, slide that on the bottom of the shelve.
Oh I see.
It could do with being that long for my airing cupboard.
.
and the towels don't  shall keep bath towels on the right and 
Yes ,

isn't it?.
But this, Dinda's underwear is so flimsy, bras, and pants and ankle socks and nylon, then , minuet space for  airing off my bras, usually tuck them behind the pipes so they don't get mixed up with  but Keith's see rummages through the socks and  underwear 
That's for the airing cupboard?
Mm.
, you can put one with .
Oh of course I could.
Yeah,
Except we've got , we've got, fish net nylon stuff over the bottom because otherwise things kept falling through.
Mm, yeah.
I used to have tea towels laid across the bottom keep them right 
Yeah.
, so he left it all open and I kept finding rolled up socks and of course there's  in the bottom of the airing cupboard where the tank is, and to pick them up and give them a shake and put them back again.
Ooh that's good.
Mm.
Not nice fat rolls like I usually get, he'll just have to make do with this won't he?
Mm 
That's one of these .
Mm,.
It's a good selling  postage and packaging,
Mm.
they still leave you room to put it on the bottom of the thing and I just scrubbed that .
Yeah .
Mind you I think if you sent it without any postage and packaging charges I'm pretty sure that they would er, they would send you the goods because they wouldn't want to loose a good customer.
Well, no.
.
Yeah, yeah,.
I've got a card holder as well, and I can never find my card holder 
Oh dear .

Yeah.
.
Oh it does hurt me to see how much the girls have spent on Christmas wrapping paper
Yeah, mm.
and it's all crumpled up shoved into an empty box or an empty bag
we go round and collect the little bows and ,
oh yes, keep it as a birthday present, yes, yes,.
keep it, keep it, glue them back on again can't you?
Oh I can't bear to throw those sticky bows away, when they're not, they're not
Beautiful colours aren't they?
Yes.
I, I, if nobody's looking I'll keep the  paper because you can always .
I do, I do.
Use it on birthdays.
Use it on the boxes with labels as well, oh it's not bad, it's not bad, have got a shiny finish.
Oh it has, oh it's nice  .
If you get it too cheap
Yeah.
and you're packing a book the corners will come through.
That's right, yeah.
Oh that's not bad at all.
Yeah.

Hippopotamus.
Mm, mm.
.
paint brushes.
you might have a grand child to  wrap up something for.
Yes,
The paper,have the paper already with a couple of .
yes.
, I haven't heard of  for ages.
No, no,you talk to Mary, you know,
Do you ever hear from her?
She does, but she doesn't know  how  from what I can make out, she doesn't know how long, much longer  is going to stick at Reading or she's going to do her usual, stick at something for two, two months .
Reading?
Reading, she's, she got herself, I told you she got herself a place in Reading College, to do her, an English A Level,.
Oh, Reading you see, I think of Reading, Berkshire.
Yeah, that's right, Reading, Berkshire.
Oh no, you didn't tell me.
Didn't I?
No.
Oh, well she did .
No, that would of stuck in my mind.
Yeah.
She moved down to Reading?
She got herself a job in Reading college, she got somebody to take her down there and  a place to get an English A Level, and Mary said it's a thing with her she wants to get this English A Level cos her father had one and she feels that is she could get and English A Level it would impress him, he, she spends her life trying to impress her father who doesn't really takes much notice of her,.
Yeah.
And she started off quite well there, she was a little bit erm lonely and missed her  and everything but she gave the appearance sticking it out until I spoke to Mary last time when she said oh .
She must of got a grant.
She, she's there on Social Security which means she can only do part time education because if you're on the Social Security you have to  available to do a job
Yes.
so that 
Which is reasonable isn't it?
yes, so, so, that you can only do education part time.
So Mary said she, she came back up to the, a little while ago she said she didn't get  do something
Mm, mm.
and even an English A Level's not much good to her, yet she  .
She should do what Dinda done, I mean Dinda went to evening school for her computer
Mm.
A Level while she was working during the day
Mm.
This is, this is it.
Paid for her to help .
.
Erm, living there because all  can do at the moment, is work in a shop or a restaurant or something like that and she doesn't get paid as much as she'll get on Social Security so it's not worth it,
It's terrible.
it's terrible,awful  showing her sense of responsibility and doing what she says she's going to do.
Wouldn't she of done better to take erm a six month's course in secretarial skills?
Well Mary said if I thought for a minute that she would stick at it, I would pay for her  but 
Yes, yes .
she won't, she's, she's just on the, oh I don't want to work in a boring office  we've, we've tried to say  not, you don't have to work, it's an in, it's an in to what you want 
Exactly ,
to do, you, you get into the boring office and sort of, yeah, yeah .
it opens the door, it opens the door , that's why both my younger girls, I mean Diane's a different policy any way cos she wants to be a , but with the other two, who worked  interest in computers and  when they left college I gave them crash course in, in typing not in shorthand because they don't they don't need shorthand nowadays ,
Really don't need that now, no .
but I find it useful.
Well yes, but I mean, it, now they do audio typing and computing don't they, doesn't  computing  .
Yes, yes, that's right, they use , yeah , but I insisted that it were open doors for you as jobs were so hard to get, I said it were open doors for you  and it did it helped them both.
Yeah,.
Once you're keyboard,
.
keyboard something
Mm.
you've got a keyboard skill and they, they can teach you 
.
these word processors and 
they were talking .
Oh yeah, oh you talk to him?
Yeah.
I think I .
Anyway it, it doesn't alter the fact that if she wanted to do something, erm,really  .
Last I heard she was living with her for .
well she wasn't, she was according to her she, she was allowed to use  pity, because she, she could, I said to Derek could have been so nice you and her, a little firm together working for the good of the two of you
That's it.
now all, all that's Mary 
But I mean, a lot of people don't  glorify on the jobs they do, I mean Dinda she said you know, it's awful being the one who's getting all the  all day long, kind of explained  and help them with their problems, sympathise with, with something that doesn't work   she'd much rather be outdoors than being a  or looking after , but she said you know, it's, it's a secure job and these days I think well I'm not   I run my own car and they don't really think that  
Well then, somehow other people seemed to be .
Think  she's absolutely,recession on, so many people
Mm.
all day long I'm getting phone call from .
Mm
Erm.
People who,camcorder or a camera or a video, video camera,
they do say that, that one
microwave
people don't seemed to have cut
No.
microwave a new vacuum cleaner or whatever, I mean all the things they make, music centre  that is a luxury really.
Most people are buying those sort of things  
I know it's  one of the last things I'd would 
Vacuum cleaner, yes.
Mm.
Having been through the spate of using a clapped out vacuum cleaner that didn't do its job, and how different it is now 
Yes ,
that I've got one that works.
I remember when Miriam  got married they had nothing
Yeah.
they had their hi-fi .
  

It was the only thing they had, they'd got nothing except , I think it was .
I didn't get a vacuum cleaner.
, we, we got our washing machine  washing machine, remember it, we used to bolt it to the floors
Yes, yes.
we, we weren't allowed to have that one, until we could pay for it outright.
Yes.
.
Didn't have a fridge.
No, no.
Not until after we 
no ,
moved to Maidenhead.
not until you could pay for it , you didn't do, go .
Remember my washing machine where I used to turn the handle at the top, heat it up with gas 
Yeah,, yeah, yeah .
and if I'd got something big and heavy you used to say to me bring it down and put it in my big machine.
Mm 
I used to bring down quilts and   my machine wasn't big enough and in any case I couldn't possibly lift them once they were 
No, no ,
full of water.
no, but nowadays the, the machines don't take , mind you because it was  take a lot of water, waste .
Mm.
Nowadays it's
Don't they, don't they have 
I know, I know if I've got a towel in mine or a big thing and, and it's all happens to be on one side 
One side ,
of the, the drum and it starts to erm  spin
yeah
the whole thing goes woof and it all seems 
Really .
to move to one side, yeah, cos it's standing in an area and it isn't flat against .
That seems rather  something heavy.
Mm, mm,
Yes.
.
But I often look back and think well if was the girls who insisted that it's time mum had a proper automatic washing machine
Yeah.
and then only had it four years, but I used to  it was, it's such a waste that washing machine, I think maybe I've done a few shirts  hand washing and all the  water, whereas in the twin tub I'd of done the light weights, heated the water up done the shirts and , erm, got the  put in, maybe towels and then I'd put, re-heat the water if, if it wasn't really soiled and I could do either all the dogs stuff or, or my dusters 
Yeah, mm.
and then after that you've got all the water left and it cleaned the sink as you as the pump pumped it out, you could go quickly with a brush round the sink and suds cleaned all the sink for you, or you could with your  pail.
Yeah, or, or even with the garden .
Oh yes, I used to save it for the garden too.
Now, now, with it, the one thing in that's it, and all the water's wasted, you can't re-use it for anything.
No.
I suppose I could if I could pull the machine out and were, were the pipe goes over into the waste  I mean people do that in the Isle of Wight aren't they, were they've got to, need to
Mm.
they unhook their washing machine 
Oh yeah, yeah ,
and they put it into a, a an old bath or anything
yeah
an old tank yeah, so that they can save the water and use it for other things.
yeah.
Mm,
once he said girls I will get your mother a proper washing machine, I agree she shouldn't move the heavy towels  garden 
No.
 

pinks.
Pinks, yes we did get it, oh they are in 
I think I've seen him , I haven't.
 

Abu Dabi was the place I was trying to think of  I knew it was a funny name
Aha.
that's where he used to go out there  the first one started in December .
.
All he has to do  Abu Dabi 
Yeah.
London Airport where he has to
.
Paddy has never had any body aboard the S E one eleven with a video camera has he?.
They have, he has, what do you want it for?.
Well, for Pete, I saw it advertised it's a  pilot or whatever  erm videos
Mm.
thirty pounds  
Wow .
it's a two hour video with a  it takes you through  landing at Liverpool and somewhere else and studying.
Oh really, aha.
Mm, all the take offs  and 
Yeah ,
all the checks 
aha .
Oh  .
And I thought Pete  will love this .
Oh yes.
He's actually done it with Paddy
Yes.
and I thought I wonder if somebody will ask, you know Paddy
No, erm
Paddy was actually flying the aeroplane that did it, cos he's landing and take off  was so impeccable and he's training.
, well, I mean he, he knows the one and only .
Well exactly, but he trains other, other pilots on them first, thought they might of  .
No, he erm, I say with  videos that they, they send a video over an Australian thing, this chap's  the other two and one of them had a camera and he went aboard to test pilot it and he took the  all around the place round er  having flown six  five minutes and he paid  he tried to  things that had gone wrong, whatever it was and erm, he, he, he's .
, yes.
Maybe they've taken it from that  video .
No, well, I shouldn't think so, but, but I should think they've done it on purpose, they've actually gone and done it.
Yes.
As a, as a .
All I want to know is 
The backward countries have got more aeroplanes that we have.
Well one of, one chaps got seven.
Huh.
.
.
That, those, those two that Paddy brought back from Australia apparently does it .
One that queen use, they'd love that.
Yeah, yeah.
She  .
As far as I know that's, that's going out as well, erm in fact he went over to Dublin to get a bit of training erm idea in pilot .
They're all up there, there won't be any left any where else.
I  
.
Yes,.
Can't believe it
No.
it seems so big and impregnable.
Oh dear   but there was  that was a video 
Oh .
Oh me, I would of thought more and more people would fly rather  rather than perhaps the business men aren't , looking over the old  New Jersey, or New Walkie something like that , a veteran  .
A lot of the Americans did .
Can't think why and I can't think why they should think they mustn't go on Pan Am cos Pan Am are a target
No.
any American airlines
Mm.
any British airlines could be a target.
Mm 
.
Mm, mm  
should know .
.
coats sitting on you?
George smoking.
I said look, Joan's had her eye on  she doesn't smoke, Paddy doesn't smoke  pipe on a chair.
He doesn't smoke at all,.
Certainly give them  , yeah and I said Joan will tell you not only does her  but the table that he sits on and the wall around it ,
Wall around it, yes ,
absolutely filthy, oh I can't be like it, I said she didn't ground it  just dirt 
dirt 
from the dog running and the vacuum cleaner 
it does doesn't it?
I said that's what it's for, yeah, yeah.
If it, it wasn't dirty then it wouldn't be .
So what I do is, I, I turn one off at night downstairs and I put one on in the bedroom
Yes.
I've got one in the bedroom, and er, in the morning I turn one of in the bedroom and try and remember to turn the one off in the  turn the light out downstairs.
their light.
It's very difficult, it's very difficult at my age to remember all these .
Oh if any one can  fair enough.
Oh  put mine on the mantelpiece, I don't, I don't know whether they like to .
Oh  television attracts dust any way doesn't it?
Yes
.
But I, I must .
Takes forever, takes him forever.
Yes  
Yes, cos he's got one of those erm, oh dear what's it called, it's got a big thing tube and stuff and it's got one of those erm bits round the outside it goes on  what do you call those er, and you, you squeeze it don't you
Oh yes , that's right
and it comes down.
I've got some of that  down at Cambridge,got more control
Yes
and it's very hard to push any way
Yes.
this one it just comes out like soft rubber
Mm.
and you just fill in the gaps
Yes, yes, when Paddy tried to do ours in the flat  need to use small screw drivers to make the, the .
Mm.
and of course it was all squashed up either side, we have to wait until it's dry now.
Yes.
It's smelt to high heaven
It does smell doesn't it?
Oh, oh it's strong, he said  and you shouldn't leave it till ten o'clock at night, then it's on a cold night and have to open the windows
Mm.
the bathroom window all wide open when I went upstairs to bath, I thought  I, I   .
oh dear.
When he wrenched his back he wasn't doing anything in the house, when he wrenched his back all he was doing was lifting the carton of the back seat of the car.
.
It shows that something stupid  and it just went,spine, and he was sitting on the pavement out there for three or four minutes in agony,
Really.
had he done it when he was lifting, like putting the bath in or something, I could understand it
Yeah, yeah.
or put, lifted part of his precious machine.
Yeah  You ready for your lunch?
Oh  yawning.
I thought really done all  haven't done all that much, cos I was alone most of the time
Mm, mm.
The  make you, sort of what were doing when  making  another member of staff, so there's a  going on full time   having free coffee like Dinda did, much  change it to be , but I mean it's just there for free, all day every day, she's now  ten penny piece in, they get a card, get a little pin pricked on, every time they used it up to twenty they get twenty cups of coffee on its card
.
no, they loose it so of course they have to go and buy another card .
Every time I do the laundry I bet there's a coffee machine card in there, shirt pocket, there's two there this morning.
Oh I guess that, that means that's all right when it, did you   coffee machine .
seventeen thousand pounds if he gave them a free cup of coffee.
Well he, he, he  given them a free cup of coffee it'll be alright, but he didn't, he gave, the machine took ten P pieces so he provided them with the ten P pieces to put in and then when it was full up he'd empty it out and give them all ten P pieces back
So he was given them coffee.
So he was, for it was, it was a perk, or something like that,I, I couldn't really understand what they, they were getting at .
I couldn't understand it either.
I thought that was absolutely .
To charge him I mean, somebody gets a company car
Mm.
the tax man charges him, who is, who's got the use of the company car
Yes, yes.
doesn't charge the boss
No, that's right, mm.
Well I think  expenses I'd should imagine that's written off against it.
Well he, he said if they, if, if, some, get a visitor in and I give them a cup of coffee well that's all right, but  I don't know if it's money or, or like maybe, maybe .
But it seems to me  it's the person, people drinking the coffee who are getting the perk, therefore they should have twenty pounds a year added for  free coffee providers
Mm.
worth twenty pounds a year or whatever it is worth 
Well he  he was saying that, that the boss was the one that provided the money that the chap was .
So he, that was definite, yeah.
If he was given them tokens or something like that, it would of been alright, but I, I, I  a couple of weeks ago 
Perhaps now they're not doing it then .
I've forgotten the details on it .
Well imagine what Panasonic are going to own
Yeah.
giving out those great big blocks of , all getting as much as .
Well, this, this is  a lot of people, of er to erm .
Oh I .
he, he was sort of on loan to another company
Mm.
and they say  film industry department, Wakefield somewhere got John's name out of the blue, so that, don't know anything else about it because he's, he's always been seen by you know , this, this other company, and he got three tax  eighty seven, eighty eight, eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety, and one what, were the estimate was twenty five thousand pounds, and five thousand pounds
Yes , and he hadn't even earned that had he?
not a chance, he, he never even earned that much money in all his  , no but I mean having, having had the income tax done that to you  however ridiculous that it is you've got to do something about it
, yeah
and having been sort of helping 
.
The  finally he decided what  he had to right back to say, you know, I, I, tell you this is how much I've earned
Yeah
this is how much tax I've paid, this is, I mean if you go on the dole too unless you've made a note of it there is no record of how much you've been paid on the dole, they, they give John the what he calls a giro, takes it to the bank and cashes it and there is no, no record of  and when he's been on the dole.
I mean he's got plenty of  every single bit of papers that they're given all the time.
Yeah , but the D S S must have it,.
Well I, I don't know how keen they are on giving them out, just .
.
Actually it was lucky for us because when John rang up  the
For his firm.
for his firm, erm, he said  I'll, I will see to it, which she's doing at the moment but , but erm, I don't know how far
At least it's got an end now with the others if he's on the film company, he's got an end now hasn't he now he's got  .
Yes I suppose so, but I feel sorry for Simon cos you see John and Geoff they can both go on the dole but Simon's is .
The  or, or anything so at the moment .
.
Any way the thing is erm, I hope  only have a  
 
What he's, he's earns, er pay tax on everything he's earned
Yeah
never had a  not for all the things  
No, no 
and er, he's been on the dole admittedly he did go on the dole  If you're on the dole for part of the year, your own salary is  do they add your dole money to the salary, charge you tax on that ,
Oh yes, oh not half 
you see so I think,
not half 
I said to Paddy I think that they do that John will owe, owe them some money cos he'll owe them tax from all the doles .
he can't tell them how much it is?
Because er, I don't know whether
Oh well that  signature for it every time and it goes on his file every one has a file .
Well I hope so , because he's been when he went 
Huh.
He didn't get very much .
So I, I don't think it's finished yet somehow, he don't seemed worried about it  
It seems that they chase somebody like John who, at the outside may end up after five years owing them perhaps a hundred to two hundred pounds
Mm.
and yet people like the Maxwell board
Yeah, yeah.
millions involved and other people who are running dodgy companies
Yeah.
going bankrupt and then starting up another company in another name
Mm, mm
which I don't think should be allowed, go right themselves off and leave lots of people that they owe money to and can't get it, they get threatened 
That's right and then they go and start again 
in the  or something, it's  some of them are  all over again, start them off of course.
that everybody without jobs .
Oh the people that took over the .
Mm.
Ever such a charming family,green grocers  nice enough people they have next door
Mm.
he said and I got on very well with them, have a chat and I used to help them when they came in  they were West Indians which gave everybody a bit of a shock when  running a local Spa
Yes.
, but erm,and I notice that quite often the shelves would be half empty,came here, I would stop on the way back from the school  the bank and the butcher's and the paper shop over the road I could come in quarter to nine and I'm, you know, I, I was done and I said to my Arnold they're not going to sell much unless they put some money into filling the shelves surely Spa will back them, and he said I keep on telling them that I keep on saying to them if you don't put the goods there on display people are going to go over the road to Lipton's and  and
Mm, mm.
eventually they went bankrupt, Florrie is an  of mine, she used to work there part time and she always enjoyed it, she's been there say twenty years , she just came back from holiday and found the place is closed down and none of for the past er fifteen months he'd been there, that past fifteen months none of their part time staff had their stamps put on their cards, so for their, for their pension 
yeah ,
they've, they've got to put their National, National Ins Insurance stamps, erm, none of the Tax that they'd stopped from their wages had been paid to the tax man, so apparently there was  I don't see how they've already paid their employer ,
they  ,
it was P A Y E,not .
.
Yeah,but people can do it even in a little way
Yeah.
little local people, part time housewifes earn a bit extra to pay their mortgage or save up to go on holiday
Yes.
.
.
Yeah.
.
Not very fair is it?
No it's not 
How that coffee machines  any, any old machine  well it's a small office, maybe a bigger offices have the vending machine, but every office will have a machine.

Mm, mm.
look at it, it's  isn't it?

What I'll do pay out extra for two bits of plastic.
that was a good idea if you can borrow next door's dustbin  your own you'd narf get a lot of leaves up
You would.

Most of my leaves drop down and fall in the borders

I was talking to Alison saying that sometimes I think we spend too much money keeping all these erm criminally in sane
Yeah.
I said to her, it's all very well, but, we spend so much money on them and we don't seem to spend any money on victims.
No,.
And she said, sometimes I can agree with you she said, but some of them when they come into a library, you feel  helped
Yeah.
and others  really victim , I said but isn't it, isn't it kinder in a way, I wouldn't, if they really are sick in their minds then but for the grace of god  wouldn't it be kinder to stick a needle in their bottoms when they were asleep so they didn't wake up again
Yeah.
and she said well we've got, for instance, one of my favourite patience is the girl of er, I think she's nineteen, and er, she's in their because her father had raped her since she was about eight, when she was sixteen she killed him, well I said well I think she should have been given a medal.

Mm.
likely to of had a have a knife in her pocket and turned round and stabbed him.
Yeah, well you can't blame her can you?
No, I can't blame her
But I suppose you have to 
But it seems to me she shouldn't be locked up in Broadmoor, she should be somewhere where it's more  supervision, but more freedom where she can walk around gardens and places like that, erm
, well she should after a while .
Yes, if they put you in a
grow older.
close order with nuns or .
.
understand  especially is one of them was a
beat her up while he was, while she's asleep, didn't actually do it, while he was actually abusing her, so .
, I mean a woman that frightened we all be seething inside and of course seeing him asleep in a drunken stupor to think now's my chance, she must of been in a terrible state emotionally
Yes .
and thought now's my chance if I .
She couldn't of done anything to him while he was abusing her
No

It was cold ,
Wouldn't set foot outside.
Cold over the meadow then.
Do you know how, if you've got a lot of toadstools and fungus in your  in your garden, you have to dig down don't you, it said about six inches  down .
,.
That little pouch in the front where I have flowers in, in the summer, absolutely covered in toadstools, it's all the way round there it's all covered in toadstools.
What, what I do?
They're probably edible.
Oh dear, the thing is, as, as far as I can remember I can't find it in any of the two books that I've got out at the moment, it's not under , but I vaguely remember that you have to dig down a certain .
