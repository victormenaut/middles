But now he
I've been watching videos most of the day.

Why?
Did this this morning    watching a video.
It was on evacuation.
Oh!
Was it?
It was really good, especially for schools.
Yes.
You know, I mean, why teach with chalk and talk.
Why not just put a video on?
Well fancy that!
Cos it's all there, you know.
Er, it was really good.
Er and it's  only half an hour.
Was it all about evacuees?
About half an hour, you know.
Well, German evacu evacuees, but it's all condensed so that you got a lot of information.
Yes.
Not like a drawn out television programme, you know?
Oh!
I'd like to have 
And 
seen that.
people relating stories about how they  you know, people lived in these la ca they lived in slums really  they, they quoted Lancashire.
Yes.
People lived in slums.
And they went out into the country  to these evacuated people and they, they thought they were in absolute
Heaven.
Mm.
Mm.
It says, and when they got there  lot of these kids were dirty  they had head lice
Oh yes.
he said they,th they, they stunk he said, the wa they were in a terrible state!
Mm.
He said, the shoes are falling off their feet.
And these people took them in  cleaned them up  put them in like a bloody sheet,and all sorts he said  
Yeah.
and they really, and they all got an allowance  from the government
That's right.
for these kids you see.
And they got the, well got them all new clothes
Mm.
and then er  regarded them as their own, you know.
Mm.
And they said, and they loved it!
Thought they were in heaven!
Yeah.
Yes.
Sa this wo this kid went out having this bloody bath   said can we not do this every day?
You know, he  
 
but a bath was something never seen before you know.
Probably had one every year.
So he had to wait in the house and er  now it's bed time now.
So she said, I'll show you to your bedroom  and there was two sisters, and she says, you sleep in that bed and you sleep in that bed.
Two single beds in the room.
Mm mm.
She said, we can't do that.
She says, why not?
She said we always sleep together
sister and me.
Yeah.
She said, why do you do that?
Says, well  if I wake up in the night and my sister's not there I'll think someone's taken her or she's run away, I'll be frightened.
And the same applies the other way so we always stick together.
Mm.
So we can't sleep in separate beds.
She said oh we always sleep in separate beds here.
We never have two in a bed.
She said oh at home we have five in a bed.
That's true enough!
That was bloody true  as well!
Yeah it was.
By Jiminy!
When they lived in two up and two down.
So  she said, and then we got undressed she said, and I got in bed  in my er  my vest and knickers  and th and the lady said where's your pyjamas?
She said I haven't got any and I don't know anybody else who has !
Yes, it was an eye-opener for half these people.
Oh!
It er, you know, it was very, very good it was.
Oh I know.
Well I  well, you can imagine living in these bloody back to back slums.
Oh!
And going to some like little farm house.
Oh yes!
Oh I know.
Nice lace curtains and open fields and 
Mm.
Mm.
it was just paradise!
Must have been.
Must have been.
Cos they said, they di this bloke said  I didn't know anything like that existed.
No.
I thought everywhere was like where I was.
That's right.
Didn't know anything.
Cobbled streets and bloody back yards, you see.
That's right.
And all smoky.
Oh I know.
Well fo well there was some lads from Liverpool that was evacuated when we were evacuated.
Oh!
God!
They were filthy!
Mm.
I mean  not just filthy i er  bodily but they had filthy habits.
Mm.
They were terrible!
And in fact, I think they only la they didn't last a week.
They were sent 
Mm.
back.
Yeah.
I'd like to have seen that.
Ooh he was saying tha that, that a million  not a million old people, blind people  sick people, kids
Yes.
were, were dispatched in about a day!
Yes.
Twenty four hours.
It's incredible!
He said it was a, a, a tremendous er
Mm.
achievement, you know 
Mm.
Mm.
to get all these people.
Then of course, then when they  the kids went up, didn't know where they were going, and the parents didn't know  but they found new found freedom because all the bloody kids had gone to the countryside
That's it.
mother and father on their own  they're going out dancing and er 
Mm.
and enjoying their ruddy  selves didn't they ?
And didn't want them back.
And then she was going out making money on munitions.
Yes.
So there's a big income coming and no kids to feed.
Yes.
Yeah.
And then of course, this was all blown when  th the raids stopped for a quite a long time, all these bloody kids came back!
Yes.
And they didn't really want them back at that time.
Oh I know.
I know 
They were quite happy where they were you see.
Mm.
Yeah, it's amazing really.
Yeah.
Aye.
That's a, it's a really good er, video.
Then er, after that have another, I was watching another one then  about the er  first world war, you know.
Mm.
That was good too.
See, it just shows you what kind of visi videos are really, for, you know,
Oh ye er this had got educational video on the thing 
Yeah.
you know, and it comes on.
That   you se it was, it was on here a few times  he talks deliberately, and rather slow
Mm.
you know,yo usually, a dark haired chap  re got like a bit of a Yo Yorkshire northern accent.
Oh I don't know who you mean.
Er, oh!
What was he in?
Don't know.
Oh!
I don't know his name.
Erm
Not James  
And all these kids came together, and they all went , you know, that's how he talks.
Mm.
No.
Can't place who you mean.
No, well he comes on here.
Yeah.
He's very slow and deliberate.
Yes.
But he's a good er  good sort of narrator 
Yeah.
you know.
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh.
I got er, I got the er, I went, I went 
Ah tha them look, them look alright, them
D'ya know those were reduced from thirty one pounds to fourteen.
Were they?
Yes .
Yeah!
Good buy that then.
So I thought, well i yo in a, in a presentation box 
Yeah!
and everything.
It was a good
Er, I just think yo er, you know, you couldn't be bit for that.
So while I was there 
Couldn't for that could you?
Well yo you know when I looked round Gordon there was nothing, nothing less than that really.
And I thought well, it's for an engagement present, just sort of two
Yes, it's ideal.
it's er ideal, and they like wine  so 
Yeah.
I thought it would be er  ideal.
They had quite a lot of sa er  glassware erm  on er  half price.
Or le more than half price really.
Less than half price I should say.
That's good.
So while I was there I went to have a look at the erm  the microwaves for Carl.
Oh yes.
And er, he was very helpful in Rackhams.
He really was.
Erm,an bu and he knew his stuff as well.
And he, and he said really he sa he said have you got one?
So I said yes, I we I explained why I wa I was asking the question, I said it was for my son, and er  I said, but mine's just a, a microwave I sa and he said, well he said  they re the combination ones now he said are really  you know, what you need.
He, so, I said well I don't know much about the combination.
So he said, well they have a grill  at the top he says, so if you're cooking a chicken  instead of it coming out pale  th the grill will come on  and it will brown it
Oh I see.
and it's got a, but it's been cooked by the microwave, you know.
Yeah.
And a and also, I mean, it was, and it was a Panasonic one this, erm  what you do, if you were doing a jacket top potato, you er would weigh the potato and, and then  erm  put in the weight, say it was six ounces, and all you do then is press erm  jacket potato, you don't have to put any time, it automatically does it for the time.
And that er, that's what it is on the thing, jacket potato on there?
Oh yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
You know.
It was really, it was very good.
Now  how much wa he's written it down, I've got some catalogues as well.
And there was .
And you can buy now, which I didn't know, erm, a microwave which is a conventional oven as well!
You know
Oh aye!
so you can do away with an with your big ovens.
Oh yeah.
It's got a grilling, so you can grill your  er  steak and so forth, your microwave and er, a fan assisted oven  all in one!
That's what you need like at the top for your er
That's right.
To stand it on.
Yes, but yo 
Er the hob.
you need the hob don't you?
Yes.
I'm thinking if you've got one of these built in things you could 
That's right.
Yes.
Yeah.
But, as I say, I we I went there and I got all the information there, and then I went into Dixons and I    I did what they did on the television, you know, started talking and  so I said well er, you know, do you have the er  ha I noticed that there was erm  no finance er 
Mm.
you know, interest.
So he said, oh no that's only on the Sharp and on washing machines.
So I said, well  how about anything off for cash?
So they said no, erm, erm  if you can beat that price we will pay you the difference.
So I said, oh.
So he said erm  but we ha being refurbished in four weeks' time and we've got to sell everything in the shop
Mm.
and he said you will then get it cheaper.
He said er, is your son desperate for it?
So I said, no, he don't get married for six weeks.
So he said, well he said tell him to come in in about four weeks time he said, we'll be getting rid of everything.
Mm!
So, you know, but they hadn't got  the selection that Rackhams had.
No.
You know.
Rackhams had, you know, like the Panasonics and
Mm.
Hitachi and so forth.
They were, really good.
Mm.
So
I had a good nosey round.
Mm!
Ooh!
It was cold.

And plus I nearly got kno 
By Christ!

I nearly got knocked down.
You didn't?

A bloody, a bloody car came through on red!
The green man was flashing  and we were crossing it and it just li I had to jump back onto the pavement!
Bloody hell!
A woman said, my God!
And it came through on red Gordon!
You know where the er, the er MacDonalds is on the corner?
Yeah.

I was crossing there.
I couldn't believe it.
Everybody sort of, you know, they were, they were just absolutely staggered!
It frightened me to death!
I bet it did.
Mm.
I mean the  the green man was flashing so all lights were on red.
Yeah.
Well  it came through  anyhow.
Oh we are.
Absolutely dearest.
Oh dear .
Did you get a hat then?
No, I had a look  ha, in Rackhams again.
Erm, I saw a few white hats  but erm  I tried a couple on, I thought one would have suited me, but it didn't.
Didn't suit me at all.
Anyhow, so I didn't, I didn't bother.
I saw a pair of shoes, if my grey shoes don't go with this dress, I've seen a pair of shoes that I like.
You know.
Well I have to, I, I'll have to have Elaine with me about the hat because er  I prefer somebody else with me
Mm.

Have to wait and see.
It was quite crowded though.
I er, I sar I said to  I was talking to this bloke in Rackhams and I, I said do you still have your late night on a  Thursday?
So they said yes.
He said, in fact, we're open every night now till six o'clock.

Oh!
He said, cos we find people weren't coming in at nine o'clock, you know

It just means if they do roll towards the edge it stops 
Yeah.
the  I mean, they can get over it  and they can get 
Yeah.
round it that way and that way, but it just stops them  in their sleep.
There's something there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll ask her.
Yeah.
Remind me to  to ask.
Yeah.
Hopefully, I'll get  by then.
Mm mm.
So what will you, will you sleep with mother then?
I don't know.
Oh God  mother !
Urgh!
Wurgh!
Did you watch that on Hanratty?
Yeah.
Yeah it was good.
It was good.
I know what i i I suppose it is a good case though.
And close to the end a few people that were hanged a are innocent.
But I think if you did bring back hanging it'd cut out some of these flaming crimes.
I do as well.
You know, I mean, for all the 
Well there should be some 
if 
degrees of it shouldn't there?
I mean if, if it means that th th there's less, there's less people murdered or whatever then, I know it sounds easy to
Yeah but if you're one of the innocent ones.
I know, I said that to Kevin, if you're part of the family 
Yeah.
of the innocent 
It's 
one.
very difficult.
It was funny case though Hanratty weren't it?
Because sh I mean she was a eye witness and she picked him out.
I know, but she picked the wrong one out at first.
At first 
So
yes, but er, you can understand the confusion really.
I don't know really.
I have very mixed feelings about it.
But the whole, the whole case was ridiculous.
I think he was up, er, I mean that Alfons Al 
Alfonso.
Alfonso  I think he was the guilty one really.
Aha.
I do.
But like in the statement she said he was erm  a, original statement she said he was approximately thirty years of age.
Yeah.
I know.
And then it was changed to twenty five!
Mm.
Mm.
Things like that.
The battle for him though has been going on for years  ain't it Gordon?
I think it's sad that, I mean, even now, his name was cleared and e his parents 
It's no good.
wouldn't know, and he wouldn't know and 
Mm.
It's too 
Yeah.
far too late int it?
Yeah.
Well his brothers are still alive.
Well, yes.
But I don't know really.
It's erm  difficult to say.
Mm mm.
I thought it was good.
But 
Is that on every week something like that?
Or  is 
No.
that a one-off?
No.
They'd obviously 
It's a one-off.
that was just one-off.
That was just one-off.
Well there's murders 
I don't know.
a on, on, on a, on a Monday night now it's a True Crimes  that have never been solved.
Er with Edward Woodward or something?
Yes.
Well this week, it's Freddie Mills.
Now he was a very well known boxer when we were  young, in our teens weren't we Gordon?
Mm.
And he was the first  er, really, er boxer who became a celebrity.
You know, like Henry Cooper is 
Yeah.
now?
Well he mixed with all the stars  and of course, I suppose part of the underworld, but er  they reckon that he didn't kill himself, I mean they did bring it in as suicide but er  they reckon that  you know, there's people think he was murdered.
Oh I see, so
He was a good boxer weren't he Gordon?
Yeah.
He really was.
Do you know what he did to me then?
He was pla he, I said go on you can go out.
He says, yes.
I, I, get shoes.
And he brought my shoes  for 
Oh!

In the mornings he brings me my slippers and then sli pulls my dressing gown off the door.
Dressing gown.

And football's a gentlemen's game played hoo hooligans.
Hooligans.
Ah.
They say about watching as well.
Ah!
Ah!
Don't you smack your Popsey!
Er er  they never, you know when you watch it on television, there's never trouble in rugby like they do in football is there?
Well i in rugby when there's trouble, it's face to face  say what you wanna say and smack them!
In football, it's wait till the ball's gone then kick them from behind!
 
Ye cha 
It's all bloody 
it's a bit more child  
It is isn't it?
it's silly li 
Hello.
little schoolgirls play football.
Mm.
Rugby league's the harder game of the three.
Is it?
Yeah.
It's no use  trying to smarm me .
I could watch a game of rugby, I couldn't watch 
A biscuit.
a game of football.
No!
Yeah.
I wonder what is, what is the basic difference between rugby league 
Not me.
and rugby union then?
Rugby union players have got a brain.
Just there.
Yeah .
Rugby league players are thick!
Is it for me?
Stupid!
What do you play?
 
What do I 
Mummy.
I knew she was gonna say which do you 
Mummy.
play !
Rugby union I play.
Well rugby league is a, is a, is there 
Basically 
more things you can
rugby league players get paid for playing rugby.
Fresh orange?
It's a job.
Yeah.
Er, that's what you see on a Saturday 
What?
afternoon  are things like rugby league challenge cup final or something.
Yeah.
Salford  Saint Helens
Yeah.
Wigan, Widnes, they play rugby league.
You get paid for playing  er, you don't ha or you have very few scores, you don't have line-outs  and basically you tackle about  a hundred million times a game.
So basically you just run at them all the time.
Fresh orange.
I see.
So the rules are a bit different then?
Oh yeah, they are quite significantly different.
 
But I know a lad that's physio for Wigan 
Okay darling.
Wigan rugby league, they do a very good physio now  and he was saying when he was Leigh, he was with Leigh rugby league first of all, they had players in their second team  and it was their sole intention 
 
to go out and break people's jaws!
It's the only way to do it in a game.
They don't care if you get 
Here are darling.
sent off for it.
As I say 
Ta.
absolutely stupid!
Good boy.
Mm mm.
Th the only ones are ed educated are the ones that go from rugby union to rugby league.
The rest of them are absolutely stupid!
Ye they're all the miners, the steel workers, the clea th the 
Can you put  
road cleaners.
have you, is he got 
Yeah.
you?
They're not proper people.
No.
No.
 
They're not.
They're absolutely
I'm sure they'll be pleased to hear him say that !
And all the, all they are er  they constantly get done up for beating people up in pubs.
Mm.
They're just dic er er aggressive.
Aggressive people are they?
Very fit, very aggressive.
Dickheads.
Basically.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
And you can see when they, when they spo when they talk to them after the game.
They just, they can't construct a sentence.
It's like their contrast mu contracts must be amazing!
Most probably Xs 
Thick headed.
just Xs at the bottom of the contract.
They can't write.
Crazy!
But they do, they get paid a lot of money but only for a short period of time.
Yeah.
And because they get paid a lot of money they'll put a lot more into it.
I mean there's people my size that are probably faster than our fastest bloke at the club.
Our club.
Yeah.
They're very, very,fi fast .
Mm.
Ellory Hanley's a rugby player.
Have you heard of him?
No.
He's probably  of a rugby league player that is
Aye.
I like watching rugby league.
I'd hate to play it, but I like watching it.
Aye.
Yeah.
Oh .
But most of them are on television, the rugby league, then are they?
The only ones you see on, unless you watch on Sunday afternoon, like I watched last Sunday, that's rugby union.
Mm mm.
On a Saturday afternoon  is invariably rugby league, yeah.
Apart from internationals.
Yeah.
It's always rugby league.
Cos there's a lot more sponsorship in it..
That misplaced you didn't it?
Still favourite, Land Mine

Yeah, we've had a whatsername?
A sweepstake at work.
Oh aye.
Mind you, it's like, it's like fourteen years since the favourite won the National.
They could never win no matter what.
No.
We're gonna get fifteen quid for second.
Pardon?
And a fiver for, third and fourth.
D'ya want to go outside?
Yeah.
I'm going to do a 
So 
wee.
actually there's a good chance it's going to win one of them.
What were your stakes?
Sorry?
What were your stakes 
Do you want to go outside?
for that?
Well it's only a pound, we put a pound in and pick 
I mean pubs, don't 
pick a pound and pick a number out.
Oh.
I just happened to pick, I picked the favourite and everyone was going   .
Look!
They've never heard of him
Yeah.
I'm going upstairs to do 
I don't know a thing about horses.
 
Come on.

Well he is  the other way ain't he?
Ye well, could be right actually.
I mean, he's got a very dubious past ain't he?
Oh aye.
Didn't realize he was seventy.
I don't like him though.
Bit of a quiet type.
Could hit him!
Not that I'd  wish him ill, I mean
Yeah.
I imagine he's  .
It means he's got all the er .
God!
Isn't that flaming whatsername popular?
A plant name.

Yes.
Thank you.
I don't know.
Very popular.
I don't often look at what's in the garden.
I know.
Hopeless!
Do you ever ro have you ever rolled your garden?
Do you remember you used to roll them?
No.
Can hardly see the sense of it !
That's right.
You think ours is bad !
Used to get a swimming pool in winter didn't we?
In the middle.
Where the dip is.
Right in the middle of the lawn.
Oh aye.
Did you?
Big puddles.
Did you?
It's very hard round that area.
But it looks alright because it's a big lawn.
You know, it's
Terrible condition that lawn.
I can't stand ours.
It has, it's got worse

You know, on a decent card 
Yeah.
sort of thing.
Co when our Carl was showing it me  I couldn't believe it!
You know  so
I hope you've got it down on your thing what you thought about her.
Oh don't!
Honestly, you know what, they're going to learn from this !
 
Good job they don't know who I am.
Are they all anonymous ?
Ye oh yes we are!
 
Oh that's good.
I wouldn't like you to sort of er 
No  
start a, a World War Three would we?
No .
Oh dear me!
Oh!
Well that's terrible that is!
That i isn't that terrible Iris?
Well I couldn't, I couldn't believe it when he shown it me.
You know.
Er, and er, I said to Gordon, I said well
What?
He's cracked up already.
 
 
Knock some bloody sense into him !
 

Well that is typical of a man int it?
Yes.
Int it Iris?
They've got to do it immediately.
Immediately.
Yet she's here all day tomorrow.
 
I mean, you know, it would have  lasted 
Yeah.
wouldn't it, till 
Yeah.
tomorrow?
Oh no.
No it  wouldn't Iris .
I said, they're just coming down the road, I said the first thing your father'll say, has it got a plug on it?
Yeah.
Cos that's the first thing.
Yeah.
Funny enough, it hadn't got a plug on it.
It hadn't?
No!
Well they should have shouldn't they now?
Well I, I thought that.
I said to Lyndsey I'm sure they're supposed to have plugs on.
I don't think it comes into force till nineteen ninety three.
Ah!
Yeah.
Well, it's bad.
They 
Yes.
should have them on.
Yes.
Definitely!
Yeah.
Yeah.
But Lyndsey was saying her answer machine    Oh!
Excuse me.
That's the tea.
Her answer machine  er  she's got two answer machines cos  she so when the other wo she kept having a lot of trouble with it, kept breaking down and it'd go away for three weeks and she'd be without it
Yeah.
so she's got two, I think now.
And, she said the plug that goes into the  from the answer machine goes into the thing
Yeah.
she said  er it went, the plug went wrong.
So she can't take the plug off.
Tt.
Oh!
You cannot take the plug off at all.
No they're moulded on aren't they?
So she's gotta take, she took it back, she took it back.
She said if I send it back it's gonna be nineteen pa it's seven pound to get a  thing back!
Cor!
I said, you know they're making things  expensive for people.
Yes.
You know.
Yeah.
I mean, seven pound  and all it is a plug that's wrong!
Yes.
Yeah.
It's disgraceful!
It was, I'll tell you what it was, it was, no the plug was alright, sorry!
It was the wire
Yeah.
had come a bit loose
Yes.
so all it needed was  the plug undoing
Yeah.
and the lead to go in  you know
Putting through.
whatever.
Seven pounds it was!
It's terrible!
Awful int it?
It's outrageous what they charge.
You know for people on low incomes, how can they cope with
No.
things like that?
They can't.
I mean, seven pounds to have, I mean they're not gonna probably have an answer machine, but  you know for things  if things are going to be like that
Yeah.
how the hell can they afford it?
I know.
It's terrible!
You know.
It really is.
You don't take sugar do you?
No thanks.
But Gordon does.
Gordon does?
Yeah.
Thanks Iris.
Do you want something to eat or
No thanks.

So do I.
I really do.
Here are Gordon?

Oh right thanks.
We might have finished that  
Watch out!
Well that could have been done tomorrow!

Oh that's from New Zealand.
That's from Margaret and Jim.
Oh Hawaii.
Oh my God!
Hawaii, and they're just on their way to Pearl Harbour or something.
That's the other one of New Zealand.
New Zealand looks nice.
Well New Zealand looks like   country and
Yes.

Turning a lovely brown .
Oh God!
But I thought I'd have one from Beverly Hills Hotel actually.
Eh!
She wants to be careful if the Japs don't come to Pearl Harbour again.

I'll show, I must take these and show Jean tonight  
Er yes.
There's the pictures of the party.

Yeah.
Was it between someone running off like that bloke in that 
Yeah.

I know.
And they all
I don't like that.
No I don't.
I don't.
Yes.
I've noticed that though before.
Have you?
Yeah.
Yes I have.
Or if anybody is sort of slightly backward
Yes.
portraying someone who's slightly backward.
Or maybe brilliant or a
Yeah.
erm  a swot.
Yes.
Yeah.
I think it's all wrong.
I don't actually, I don't know why they do it because, I mean, half the people are listeners int it?
I mean it's 
Course they do.
blooming horrible!
I think a lot more these days, and a lot that you don't know that's wearing contact lenses.
That's right.
Yeah.
I must listen to this.
Again!
Yeah but, he said, you know, is that your mum there?
I said, no it's not, and then say the place.
Just on the other side.
Well should have been really  taking two of her strong tablets she says, you know, and she has .
Oh dear!
She thinks it's because she was carrying Gemma.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
On that side.
Yeah.
It sounds like a .
Oh dear!
She went to see chiropractors, you know when
Yeah.
Oh heck!
And that is bad news!
What, did she mention anything about the card?
No, I didn't.
And didn't you?
No.
I'm not having it er  she didn't do the, when she said to me I want to speak to you about it, she said, you know, she wasn't involving me at all was she?
No.
I'm thinking of writing myself you know, to Karen.
Oh no you can't do that!
I, I can.
Because I don't mind if Karen writes and bloody blames us  that it's our bloody fault, I'm not bothered.
No, I just feel that er
You don't wanna do that.
I mean we
It'll upset her that.
she's obviously er very upset, and I, I mean, I just don't want that, she's such a nice girl.
You know, like I really don't  I, I just thought perhaps a note from me  you know, apologizing.
Why not,get a note from Karen apologizing for being a, I had the hump.
Yeah .
I thought, well a note from both of us really.
Well I don't think she, and she, Karen wouldn't want that because  well it, it's nothing to do with us.
Is it?
We're sticking our er oar in where we shouldn't.
And so the other   he's there if you want isn't he?
I mean
Well I know that.
You can't stick your oar in like that to her at any old time can you, really?
No.
Well you could have stuck, you know, seven or eight years of age you couldn't even do it then in case it hurt the kid's mother or something like that, or whatever it was.
She's nearly an adult.
Well and truly!
Getting an old man now, never mind .
Well I know that.
I know, but
Well it's, it's not our, it's not our er, we'll be just sticking our nose in where it's not necessarily wanted.
Yes but it was our mistake in the first place.
Well it wasn't really was it?
Obviously, I mean I know you're arguing with her but er  but if he'd, if he'd have go if we got a christian name that night it wouldn't have gone down as either of those  Karen or  Fran.
I know well we could have found out  quite easily.
Oh aye.
That's a different story.
Yes.
We could have found out.
We could have phoned Amy and found out there and then virtually, but I think we said oh, I, summat like i i it's not worth bothering about, don't matter just put .
But it did matter didn't it?
It did matter but we didn't know that at the time did we?
Oh no we didn't.
It'll be worse now, in retrospect, it'll worse  phoning Amy up at that moment  and asking what the name was.
And he could have put it down while he was here.
Cos he didn't know the name that night .
Oh I know he didn't.
I know that.
But the thing was, what I, what I was ge getting to last night, is that we didn't bring the name into it, the surname.
Get out!

She kept putting the curlers in and i they just kept coming out.
She said I don't believe this!
She said a ee  and d'ya know what, I didn't have a student.
The students 
Didn't you?
That's daddy's car 
didn't turn up so I got one of the teachers.
Daddy's car.

Biscuit.
try and keep it 
No biscuits Edward.
So really, I wo I wish I would have gone there.
She said if I used Head and Shoulders now on this it would revert back  because it has such a sa a strong P H balance in Head and Shoulders it has the same effect as reversing it.
I, I, a hairdresser told me that years ago Elaine.
She said we would try, had a trial run.
She said we did a  an experiment and we tried to perm a girl's hair with Head and Shoulders
Yeah.
she said it absolutely, the perm just went out at a, a week.
Yeah.
Do you know a, a hairdresser years ago told me that.
Er, it's the same solution.

Wish I would have gone.
That's lovely!
That's 
Yeah.
really nice that Elaine.
Biscuit.

Keep away darling.
No, it'll come with that.
What's that?
Is that ?
Oh right.
It'll fall into how I want it.
Cos you never, I hate my hair when it's first permed 
I do.
because until I've washed it
Daddy's car.
and  blowed , I bet it were very tight 
 
cos it drops.
Just watch that, he don't run over.
Come here.

And you use, you know, like a, the size of a pea cos it's so concentrated.
Yeah.
So, and I got your dress.
Good.
Thanks Elaine.
And the receipt for it.
I'll have a look at it after, I haven't got time at the moment.
I'm sorry I was so late.

Yeah.
I got the six thirty though that goes a bit round the houses.
Oh, still as long as you sat down I say.

Ne near the Pleasure Beach in Blackpool.
Oh!
It was Blackpool 
Mm.

Mm mm.
Oh right.
Mind you, it is a cold place isn't it, Blackpool?
Oh it is!
And it was er, it was quite amazing when we were going on the motorway we saw these cars with erm  er er  there was like Pakistani erm  and Turkish flags flying and when we got, er when we was going at the night time to Blackpool it was crammed!
Er, it was end of Ramadan you see, and, and they'd all descended upon er 
Oh I see, yeah.
Blackpool, and it was like  muldoons weren't it Gordon?
They were all beeping their horns and
oh! 
Do you know I've just realized that your curtains  are  nearly like what I've ordered for the bedroom.
Are they?
Yep.
It's just, not the pattern, but the style.
The style of it, yeah.
The the frill and th and then sort of having an edging, yeah.
Yeah.
I er, and you know I think they're ever so nice these days th the curtains.
I think they're pretty the curtains.
Yes I do.
Yeah.
I do 
Mm.
really.
Cos it's not long now you know Rosie.
Six weeks.
Oh, do you think our Carl will survive?
I'm getting a bit worried, well I'm getting worried myself but  I don't know, I think he might be a bit nervous.
He's ve he's very edgy 
Yeah.
I think.
He is as well.
Mm.
And I think he's lost weight but I don't like to tell 
I do.
him.
I do.
I don't know whether he's told you, cos I think he has.
Yes.
Mm mm.
Yes I do too.
But you know Rosie, he does silly things, I mean  erm
I know that.
he comes home at, at nine o'clock and he, he doesn't have a thing to eat and he goes out playing squash, then he's not eating his main meal till eleven o'clock at night.
No I know.
Which is stupid!
I've told him, yeah.
I'm glad you have because he won't take any notice of me.
He hasn't anything to eat  time to eat anything.
No.
No I'm sure that he doesn't.
I know.
There we are Rosie.
He takes a, a 
properly.
sandwich you see and eat it while he's erm
Oh my goodness!
while he's, while he's working, d'ya know.
Well  I think he ought to do something.
Yes.
But there's always somebody wanting him you know, at that shop.
They always seem to  erm
?
Yes.
No Gordon, they're in the side cupboard there.
Oh.
That'll do.
In the side cupboard love.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He doesn't get a lot of peace.
There's always somebody
I'm sure.
either on the phone or in the shop, you know.
Mm mm.
I know it's er  oh I know, I think he works very hard indeed, he just sort of 
He does.
worries me  that  he really can't carry on like that.
No.
And I don't know er, what the solution 
No.
is.
Well, it'll perhaps improve when he doesn't have so far to go won't it 
Mm mm.
you know?
Er 
That'll help a great deal.
I think, I don't know if, I'm finding it quite difficult at the moment because he, he's sort of neither one thing nor the other and we're out a lot sort of
Yes.
doing things er and then we're both going home and, I don't know, it is awkward int it?
It is.
It's quite stressful  really .
I'm sure it is Rosie.
Have you got your hu your honeymoon booked up though now?
That's go I'm glad about that.
Yeah.
I've been getting er  quite worried about that.
Mm.

No, well let, let no we haven't given him the go ahead yet.
Erm, we're waiting for the joiner's estimate tonight.

But er   a thing my dad pointed out , and I'd never thought, will the cylinder go through the trap?
Cos it's a big cylinder you see.
Oh yes!
And Carl sa I was speaking to Carl today and he said, well surely, you know the three of them have weighed that up?
I said, well I don't know.
But anyway, he's going to ask the, the plumber that we're going to have do it, we're gonna 
Yeah.

And how's Elaine?
Is she keeping well?
Yes she's me she's better now than what she was er, Rosie thanks.
I think that sickly feeling
Mm.
has gone.
Oh good.
I think it's just a problem what she's going to wear for your
wedding.
Mm.
I think you'd better mention something to Rosie love about that er 
Oh  oh yes Rosie 
an apology about that letter.
we have been most upset Gordon and I about 
Oh.
this letter you received off my sister.
Oh!
That's alright.
Doesn't matter 
It's because we're at loggerheads, Rosie.
Well I gathered there was some problem.
Eh er i no I really don't know what I've done.
I erm
No.
I phoned her  er whe whe when was it Gordon?
Ma in the middle of last year wasn't it?
I didn't 
Yeah.
receive, not this Christmas, but the Christmas before Rosie, I didn't receive a Christmas card from her 
Mm.
which is most unusual
Mm mm.
and I erm, my brother didn't  and we said well there must be something wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I left it for a while, and I thought I will phone her and find out.
And when I got through I knew immediately by the tone of her voice that she was, there was something wrong.
So I said, I asked her what was the matter and she said well I feel as though er, that you've er, you and Arthur have ignored me.
I said but we haven't!
You know, and er, she said well I feel as though you have.
And she was going on!
So I said oh well, I said er  if you we really want to get the nitty-gritties I said you know we didn't receive a Christmas card from you I said but we sent them to you.
So she said er, no I know you didn't she said because I didn't send you one.
So I said, oh I said, well, you know if that's how you feel I said, but I will tell you I said I'm now a grandma and I said and er  Carl is getting married to Rosie.
Mm.
And, so she said oh, right.
And I knew that was the end of the conversation.
Oh !
So, I, I thought well we will send her a card then she's got er, and invitation  
Oh yeah.
so then she's not going to, she's not got anything to moan about.
Yeah.
But I thought the reply was abs I thought it was utterly disgraceful!
And she's done it to spite me Rosie.
And I apologize.
I didn't, I didn't take a lot of notice really.
I mean what er, what she put was that o okay wasn't it?
I know, but the paper Rosie!
And no address 
Just a 
on it!
notepad with all holes in the top.
Well never mind.
Never mind.
But I, I really do apologize about it but she has done it erm 
Well it's not, not your fault is it, you know?
I feel, to sa to spite me.
Mm.
Ooh!
I was most upset when I saw it.
Yes.
Well never mind anyway.
It doesn't matter at all.
But Carl had said there was some problems there 
Mm.
or something.
Erm
She's  she's most 
But 
peculiar.
Is she younger or older?
Oh no she's older.
Oh.
She's the eldest of the family.
Perhaps
And
perhaps sh shouldn't suggest these things, but perhaps she's going a bit off it or something .
I don't know, really.
Erm  you see when my other sister died, Ada, I mean, Arthur and I, we did all the organization didn't we Gordon?
Mm.
I mean, and we were going down every day to see her when she was 
Yeah.
poorly.
Now she came at the bitter end and she never did anything.
No.
You know, and then she starts moaning!
Mm.
This is the trouble with families int it?
You get, you get 
I'm afraid it is.
all these things and
Mm.
yeah, I don't know.
It's very difficult sometimes.
My mum er, doesn't know, in fact he's not replied yet, Uncle Stan he's her  youngest brother
Mhm.
and he's a lovely person, he's full of fun and everything  but  he, he's one of these he always says he's coming and never comes.
Yes.
So, they live near Hull.
And erm  er, when Aunt, Aunty May, you know, is blind, my mum's sister 
Mm mm.
and he's always saying, he's going to see her and he never does.
And er  he just, he said he was coming to erm  my Uncle Les' funeral but he never turned up.
No.
And, so I'll be very surprised if he comes.
Yes.
But, there's nothing wrong there between us, but 
No.
he's just like 
Yeah.
that you see.
Well you see  erm  I mean when, when Gordon and I got married  er, my sister's husband didn't come to the wedding until later on did he Gordon?
Because 
No.
he was, he wouldn't give up his Saturday work  you see.
Oh !
He's er most peculiar.
Now when Elaine 
Yeah.
got married
Mm.
then they never let me know, and as you know, er it, it costs money to sort of er, put a meal on
Course it does.
erm  Irene turned up on her own!
And I said well where's Harold?
She said oh he's got a cold.
And that was the end of it wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's, he doesn't like going to these dos, I'm sure of it, you know.
Mm.
But nevertheless, erm  oh I don't know.
Families!
Yeah.
You can choose your friends but not your family Rosie.
Oh I know.
Mm mm.
So I hope your mother and father don't think we're all like that er, Rosie.
Oh no!
The they never said a word about it, at all.
And, and we just said er
I just think it's 
they weren't coming and that was it.
just think it's heights of bad manners what she's done!
Well at least she replied.
I mean she could have done  nothing 
Oh yes.
like that and
Oh yes.
I mean, you know she could have not bothered after all.
Is Carl coming straight home tonight do you know Rosie?
Mm.
Oh.
Yeah.
He's
Good.
taking me and dropping me off
Oh is he?
at the theatre, yeah.
Mm.

Yes, that's right.
 
Mm.
Mm.

Something like that is it?
I think that's what puts me off is the title.
But I believe 
Yeah.
that  I believe the beginning, I was reading a letter in the paper and this person had been to see it
Mm.
and they said the beginning she's, she's sat there and she said oh wha what have I come to this for?

Well if I'd have got to see him he might have said something, but I don't like going and saying do you want me again now or owt you know?

But it certainly is been, I've written it on the back of the, the cheque stub when it was cashed because she, she 
Mm.
looked it up on the er, on the computer for me.
I'll write a letter instead I think.
Ya.
She's brought erm, Ida's brought the wedding present over.
Has she?
She said we're very pleased she said to er receive the invitation.
So I said, well we would have liked you to come to the full  erm   onty I said, but, unfortunately we were in a  a very awkward position.
She said oh we didn't expect to come to the evening do.
You know  so I said oh well  I'm pleased that you can.
So then she was asking me  you know, what I'd bought.
So I ha I felt obliged to show her  you know.
She liked the dress did she?
Oh yes, she thought it was lovely.
Mm.
So
Just avoided the heavy rain.
Mm.
Dear oh  innit?
God!
It's been terrible!
Re you know, when we first got up it was glorious.
I know.
I thought this is, I thought fancy going to work on a nice day like 
I know.

I thought ooh, I'll get something done in the garden today.
Yeah.
And blow me!
It started to rain 
It started what 
and never stopped.
what time?
About eleven o'clock this morning?
Yes.
But not before dinner.
Oh!
It was long before dinner.
It was about ten o'clock, ten o'clock to half past round here 
Was it?
when it started.
Yeah.
And then it eased up a bit at dinner time and then it started again  about two o'clock.
And I'd just got in at about  oh  half three.
Ooh!
And it, the heavens opened.
Well that, I couldn't believe it when it fell over this morning.
I know.
It just went at  like slow  motion .
Lying on the table it was.
Fortunately on the table and the cov that cover was on.
It didn't break the tops.
I know.
Mm.
It's top heavy.
Mm.
It's with 
I put 
it going over you see.
Mm.
See and it hasn't got a balance at the back, you see, the leaves are not big enough at the back.
No.
Where if they would have grown bigger the erm, it would have balanced it.
Mm.
Anyhow  it's alright now.
And I put extra  compost in and, but it's erm  I know, it's still very er  dodgy.
I think perhaps when they open up fully, the flowers, it'll er  perhaps balance a bit better.
Yeah.
Oh dear .
What do you think?
Please yourself.
Well  
Or eat some of it  otherwise you'll get an air lock  won't you?
I mean there's another hour.
Two hours innit?
What time did he say?
Half seven, it's half five.
Oh it's half five.
Yes of course it's two hours.
Oh e eat, eat that Gordon.
Will curry do me any harm after this?
Will it bums!
Don't have to eat it all  if you don't want.
picking me at half past seven tonight love.
Oh yeah.
Yes.
And then we'll go for a drink first and then we'll go to the Indian restaurant.
Right.
Our Carl wanted to know what, why you were going?
Did he?
Yeah.
What did he say?
He said oh, he said, what are they celebrating?
I said nothing!
Well he said well it seems funny they're going out doesn't it?
Well I said, well as far as I know, I said nothing, they're not celebrating anything.
Should have said to him, you never take dad out for a curry so Kevin's going.
Tt.
Oh Gordon!
He has taken you out.
Yeah, about  four years ago?
You're  very ungrateful!
Well he's taken us out when they've been to bloody shop working and come back and wa I admitted that, but I mean just to go out for an evening.
I mean, he never says to me go and have a, do you wanna go for a pint or  wanna go for a curry or owt  does he?
No.
Well we don't see him much now do we?
Well, I'm not, I'm not bothered about it.
It doesn't worry me.
Well  who wants to go out with a doddery old bugger like me anyway!
Surprised Kevin wants to, surprised Kevin wants to go.
Well it's 
Could go on to the rugby and go with them couldn't he?
Well
Eh?
yeah.
Instead of a doddering old bugger like who's miserable!
Well  well he hasn't got a father so he regards you doesn't he?
If you wanna take it that way.
If  if Labour say get in
  

if Labour get in and they can't fulfil their promises
Yes.
like John Smith's made promises then that  Conservatives haven't done this, that and the other, he must be able to do them now mustn't he?
Who must?
John Smith.
Well erm, they, they don't know whether they can do it or not do they?
No, but he's criticizing the Conservative policies and all that, and what we will do is this.
  

I know  for investment
Yes but they all say that 
industry 
don't they until they get into power?
I know.
And the and then  they all 
They do.
Back down.
They do.
Yeah.
They'll say they, they probably haven't got the finances to back up what they  what they said they would do.
Yeah but a lo a lot of  quotes gonna be made to them after aren't there?
You know, like you said this and you haven't done it, you said that and you haven't done it and all that sort of.
Yes but once they're in power there's nothing you 
Well 
can do about it.
oh admittedly no.
No.
But they must feel a bit stupid to er
Well I can't  well I mean there's an awful lot, I mean  would, no, no matter which political party  it is, they all make promises, but they don't carry them all out.
No.
Course not.
But I mean these are, these are major things.
Getting the economy right.
Now John Smith
But er  well John may have 
we'll get the economy right.
Now if he doesn't get the economy right he's gonna end up with egg on his face and
Of course he is.
But you tell me how  just how is he going to do it?
I mean, ee, they don't explain to you how they're going to do it do they?
No.
They, they just come out wi a er
With statements.
glibly with these, these statements.
Mm.
Mm.
I'm sure that e e if there is an easy way of doing it the Conservatives would have found out  and done it.
I don't think there's any  any easy way.
I don't see how they're going to do it.
No.
I really don't.
I mean where are they going, where are they going to get the extra money from  er to pay for the old aged pensioners' er  eight pound rise?
Mm.
Or so they say, we'll get eight pound.
Somebody's got to pay for it.
So it'll be the working people, er, probably the  the national er, health stamp'll have to go, go up.
It'll be a sorry day if they get in.
It will Gordon.
Oh!
I don't know.
You're a real turncoat you are.
Mm.
Aren't you?
Mm.
I was listening today to erm  a man on the radio and he was only thirty four and he had a stroke  and they were saying  he, they er, they were asking him, they said well how did it happen?
They said, did you have any warning?
And he said no.
None at all he said.
I was gardening  and he said er er  I bent over to do something and he said I just went dizzy, he said, and I fell over  he said and then I realized my right side was paralysed.
And he said I was completely confused and  I couldn't, he said I was trying to shout  my wife  and erm  and, er, you know my mouth wouldn't work, he said, but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital.
And they were saying, they were saying that, you know, you associate strokes with older people, but there's  a hundred young people a week  have strokes!
Tt.
Aye.
And he said erm  like it's  the clots to your brains that erm  that cause it, you know.
They said, well did you have any warning about it?
And he said er, no, he said I didn't think I had he said, but now, he said I realized that how I, was forgetting er  I'd be talking and I'd forget sort of  what I was just talking about that split second.
Mm.
And now the stroke has affected him that way.
He can be talking, say about a  well, you know, about any er, about sa say a, a video recorder or something like that
Mm.
and for a minute he can forget that he's talking about it.
Mm.
You know, but erm  he sa he's recovered reasonably well in the same, you know, but
Got his use 
very 
back?
er, partly back.
Partly back.
Not fully.
You know.
Thirty four!
I know!
I mean you just don't  you don't imagine that do you really?
No.
It's terrible!
But a hundred young people a week!
I mean, I, I couldn't believe it when they were saying that.
That's terrible!
It is.
It's an awful thing.
See I've never, I've never across anyone that like know you.
What do you mean?
Well I've known anyone to be five years and no use whatsoever.
Ah well, and Aun I mean Aunty Lilly was like that Gordon.
She never got her use back and she never spoke again.
Yeah but she didn't, well she didn't live long after her stroke did she?
Oh she did, you know.
Er, not as 
Mind, she was in bed all the time.
Oh she was in bed all the time.
Yes.
How long did she live after the stroke?
Only months weren't it?
Oh no!
Oh no!
It wasn't months Gordon.
No.
I mean she was in Park Hospital for so long and then she was transferred to a nursing home in Thornton.
Er do yo don't you remember us ta taking Iris and Ian down  to see her?
I didn't see her did I?
No we didn't go in, but Iris and Ian did.
Did he?
Yes.
Well I, I, we, I, I drove them there.
You was with me.
Yeah?
Yes!
Well I reckon she lived er a couple of years after the stroke Gordon.
I mean, and she was in a terrible, I mean she couldn't even speak!
No.
I mean, er erm  and I went to see her in Park Hospital and she was very frustrat very frustrated because she couldn't speak.
No.
What was she doing in Park Hospital?
She took ill at Aunty Edith's.
Well was it Edith's?
Yeah.
I th I think they'd been on holiday and, she took ill on the holiday  and, and came erm, she was stopping at erm, Edith's and er  it happened then.
Well, you know, I can't recall any of this.
Yes.
Did we, we go to Edith's to see her then did we not?
No, but I went to Park Hospital to see her.
Because Edith  now Edith was going away for some unknown reason, I don't know, she must have been going on another holiday anyhow.
No, she was in Park Hospital a long time.
That was it, because  Edith was going on another holiday and she was er, she wanted someone to go and visit  er Lilly, and I said well I'll go.
And I, I, it was when I had my own car and I drove there.
And I wanted to see her.
She was very, very frustrated cos she couldn't speak.
Mm!
And she couldn't write anything down.
I don't think you saw her actually.
I don't think I did.
I never recall seeing her when she was ill.
Never.
No.
No.
Well you must have been going during the day while I was at work then.
No, it was night time I went, cos I was working.
Well why in the bloody hell I didn't go then?
Why didn't I go with you?
I don't know.
Was it night school or something like that, or what?
I don't know.
I think you we d'ya know I think you were at night school Gordon when I think about it.
I think you were teaching at night school.
It must have been something I was doing.
No!
I know why Gordon.
Because the ba the children were small.
Yo one of us had to stay in.
Oh yes.
Aye, that's right.
Of course, yes.
You know, I mean, they were only small.
Aye, that's right.
Did we live in Ashton Lane then?
Erm  no, we were here.
Were we?
Yes.
Well I didn't have my own car in Ashton Lane.
No you didn't.
That's right.
So we was here.
Well, about nineteen seventy then, seventy one.
No you got your licence in erm  was it, it were early in the year when you passed your test?
Yes I think it was.
Well it were seventy one.
Mm.
Cos didn't you phone me at Lillycups to tell me?
Yes I think I did.
Yes.
Yes.
Well I was only at Lillycups from August seventy till August seventy one.
Yes.
Only a year.
And if you phoned me early in the year it must have been  just after we got the V W.
Yes.
I think it was.
Just a  couple 
So 
of months after we got that  
I think it was because er th cos we'd got Iris' er  er Triumph didn't we?
That's right.
Yes.
Soon after that.
Yes.
I think we did Gordon.
And you were driving that about.
That's right.
That's right.
Well Carl hadn't passed  
And you went, you went in that Triumph did you to the
I did.
Yes.
Well it's ser te it was later than seventy one you see.
Mm.
And you had that car about two years didn't you?
Oh yes.
Perhaps a bit longer.
Two years?
Yeah.
Because I came, I came to er  Dellasel
Yeah.
when Carl passed his er, to M G S.
Yeah.
Do you remember?
Yeah .
Blimey!
Do you mean, must be about twenty years ago then?
Yes.
Yeah about twenty.
This is why you know, I, I think you should keep di I keep diaries from years ago because  I know you don't like nostalgia, and I don't, but it's interesting 
Mm mm.
to look up.
Yes.
Er, events.
Yes.
I mean I've got no diaries dating back that long.
No, I know.
Well I haven't.
I have no record of anything 
No.
happening then.
No.
But just one line of things that  you know, I don't mean a diary where you write a page every night, but just two lines  you know.
Yeah.
All, and what you did and  when I got the car, the date and  when you got that Triumph then.
Yeah.
You know, little, just a line.
And then when you look at it er ca you can recall then
Oh yes.
other things.
That's right.
The one line sort of sets it all off, you can remember.
That's right.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yes but I remember, I can remember Edith phoning me and, and saying, you know she was going away, you know is, you know could I go down?
And I said yes.
Mm.
I, cos I remember coming, coming back, I got lost.
You know where er  that circle is where there's the shops, well instead of taking  I know, instead of taking one road I took another and I got completely lost!
Mm.
Mm.
I wouldn't now, but then I, I, I didn't know er round that area.
No that's right really, I mean if you don't know the area you don't know which road to take on the islands.
I know.
But I mean, you wouldn't have thought that Ed er Lilly, I mean, she had no weight on her or anything like 
No.
that did she?
No.
She's always been active all her life.
All, been active all her life.
No, you can't understand how these things happen.
Well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about what to do, to avoid this and avoid that.
And what to eat and everything but 
This bloody footballer, I mean it's a 
I know!
a really fit man.
I know.
He's, er, one artery was seventy percent blocked, it was in the paper.
Yeah.
And the other artery was ninety percent blocked.
Was it really?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Good God!
I mean, he could have gone an any time.
Graham Sounness, I mean he's only thirty eight!
Could have gone any time with  with nothing through his bloody arteries!
Good God!
But that's incred I didn't know it was that bad.
It was in the paper this morning.
And er 
Goodness me!
Well he's a, he, he didn't smoke.
No.
He was an athlete.
He's been an athlete.
He obviously ate like everybody else.
Mm.
And he 
I mean 
wasn't overweight in any way.
Wasn't overweight, what more  
No.
the bloody hell do you have to do!
That's incredible that!
See they say it was a ma it's hereditary.
Well
Cos his father had a bypass didn't he?
Oh did he?
I think some other relative died er 
Oh.
youngish.
Yes.
Oh well  I bet, I think perhaps it is really.
I know.
It's still going?
I know.
Yeah, and you can't, you can't understand it can you really?
Well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one!
That's right, yeah.
Yeah.
And she does all her own shopping.
Mm.
You know, I mean, she keeps stopping but she's, she's remarkable!
She really is.
Mm.
But they're few and far between aren't they?
When th you're like that.
Yeah.
Mm.
But what I couldn't understand with this Soun this fella that
This Sounness?
Aye.
He, he found out cos he went for, to, for a check up and they took his blood pressure.
Yes.
And tha well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken, they find it's high, and they 
Yes.
give them tablets.
Yes.
Go home.
Why did they take it a stage further with him?
He'd got high blood pressure, he wasn't in any pain  he's living a normal life.
Similar to what I was when I went.
Yes.
And they just give me tablets.
Yes.
Now why, what made them take it to the stage
Well  er well, first 
where, he wanted a heart bypass?
first and foremost he was in a private scheme.
Well,pro probably that's it then.
Yeah.
A and probably because i because of his father and er  the rela the other relative  having the bypasses done.
So they took it 
Mm.
a step further, but I think probably, it's because he was in er  er a private scheme.
Very likely innit?
Yes.
So there's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a by bypass.
Ah well I, well,I wouldn't say that really Gordon.
I mean I think  er, when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever, so, I think it's kept it all under control and you've, you, we eat a sensible diet.
The only, the only er  thing I complained about with you is, is the butter.
Mm.
I don't have that much now.
But I think everything in moderation, but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to.
I don't eat that much bread you see.
No.
So I, I think really, and I think  what I think with him, I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family, it runs in the family.
Mm mm.
Must be hell of a shock being told
Oh God!
It must have been.
See how much it's costing?
Two hundred and fifty pounds a night!
Yeah.
Phworgh!
That's without the operation.
Yeah.
Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then.
Oh I know.
And plus he's, he, he, he, he married an heiress you know.
Did he?
Er him er,sh they live in Spain now.
Oh er he, he's worth a pretty penny is Sounness.
He went in Carl's shop the other, the other week.
Did he?
Yes!
Mm.
Must have been looking for a house.
Carl said he, he looked er well er, his face did, it were very  he's got a very poxy skin.
Has he?
You kno mm.
Yes.
He was having it done this afternoon weren't he?
Yeah.
Some time today.
Aye.
I tell you what, that's quick int it though Gordon?
With only going in last night and
Mm.
having it done today.
It is indeed.
We I wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme.
He could wait six months couldn't he?
Well he could have been dead by then.
Well er, yeah,e exactly that's what they're moaning about int it?
Terrible!
Put them on a list and wait.
I've never heard so much talk about health  as we do nowadays.
Oh I know.
When I was young I co I don't remember talking all the time about bloody  health and  what you should do and what you shouldn't do.
No I know.
Did you?
No.
But we weren't educated in, in, in health though.
We just li we just lived and that was the end of it.
Yes but then you see, in the ol in the old days Gordon, I mean, you we you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day  and i and whatever you got you were glad of  and used to eat it all.
Now  we're much more affluent  and people are educated we er
Mm.
as regards their health.
