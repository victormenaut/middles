Well I've been in the Daily Mail's office, presumably much the same.

Yeah once I'd got there, they'd offered me it er and I went home and thought about it  actually thought about having to work for them, you know, not just to   
Yeah.

Did you phone me ?
Had you phoned  well I didn't know if you'd phoned after I'd rung you, or before I'd rung you.
I got back and they said erm oh Gav's r Gav did ring you and your mum.
And I said oh when was that and she said just after you'd gone to the bank and I said oh I've just spoken to him.
Why did, had you rung me afterwards?
Eh?
When did you ring me?
Did you ring me before I rung you?
Yeah.
Oh that's alright then.
What are you saying well did I ring you?
Cos I thought you were returning my call.
No.
Well I've been out all afternoon so  I wondered if you'd phoned in this afternoon.
No.
No that was the first time I'd rung.
So I rang you and then Lyn said yeah I'll get her to call you and then you rang me back  so it was as though Lyn had give you the message to call me

Mm.
Certainly will.
I got another erm  magazine but only because this one had erm a special supplement all about the Alliance and Leicester  explaining about mortgages and everything
Oh right.

Oh right.
I will do.
Yeah, may as well.
They're telling you like how much  ho how to ge gauge how much money you're gonna be able to take out on a mortgage
Yeah.
But with this one, think it's an endowment or something, I don't kn I don't know what that means  but you've got to be able to give five to ten percent  as a deposit.
Yeah.
It's a lot of money.
Oh eh.
So you've gotta find like something like four thousand quid.
I know.
Ooh there's been a crash.

Everyone's so busy looking at it they're not even bothering to try and get on the roundabout.
And that's how crashes occur.

Er, can I collect my Willy Wonka gold ticket now!

Or is it all broken up?
It's, no it had broken off a little bit, yeah.

Babe!
You know damn well that you prefer cooking than I do!
Don't you?
It's not so much that, it's that I prefer my cooking to your cooking.
Well there you go!
That's the answer to why you cook more than I do.
And I'll remember that next time you tell me to cook!

I sometimes wonder that myself!
Especially 
Ah!
after listening to these tapes back.
Ah!
Really!
You'll have to let me listen to them.
I listened to one in car and yo , your like that again, you snapped!
It's when I said, oh  I wish occasionally we, you know, cook straight away instead sitting around.
I don't sit around!
I'm always first in the kitchen!
Well I am!
Yes, but look at you!
It's the way you speak to people.
Erm
You speak to me like the stepbrother speaks to  all the family.
As though you just shit on his head and rubbed it in with your foot or something, you know!
Very good Gavin!
It's how Jane speaks to everybody.
Yeah, it is.
Your Jane reminds me of Jay.
She turns round and you say something in then goes  you know  with absolutely no  whatsoever  and she turns round and goes like that like Jay does.

Oh that's what I said, I said  it is but if you can get him to  say you know, Sting's deserted me  you know he, he lets me live on a, you know, my twenty three quid a week pension.
Well it's like Richard said I think The Mercury probably tried that  and then gone with this naff tale about the house.
It's like he said, he said it's a quote from, said I'm going down to stay with him next month.
But you say they make all the time, if you could get him to say it 
He, he, he had something to, to 
Does anybody want a cup of tea?
Love one please Nick.
That'd be very nice.
Eh?
What?
Er I think they've gone up to Sting's parents, er father- in-law to try and get him to say it.
Because th because he hasn't 
Because they got it?
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
at all, basically 
I think you're probably right,right, he, he  he is, he's gonna slag him off.
Where's he live?
Er  
 
It's worth a try.
He's not on the phone.
Er you ca you couldn't do it on the phone anyway  It's a case of  out and er sitting with, having a coffee with the old guy.

You know if you can get him to say, you know  tell him to forget the rai the rainforest for a, you know, for a while and think about his own family.
We're going out on a  early February to do whatsername  Rodney from Only Fools and Horses.
from Wolverhampton.
Get a chat with him, you never know what comes out of them do you?
Like Richard said if we get him to say that he'd like to do Shakespeare, he's sick of  plon plonker  good story.
He's in a play in .
It's a good story to get him to do Shakespeare cos we could write it in, you know, Shakespeare in Rodney plonker language  , you know.
Er Rodney you  and  and Rodney plonker.
Well anything, you never know you know, get him to say he's jealous of er David Jason's success or  you know.

Yeah, I think it would.
a definite penalty!
I say, he went up just to erm  frighten him and
left there.
but I don't reckon he erm  went up to deliberately shove him out the way.
Perhaps if he'd realized .
Well I should think they are.
It's probably really bowled one!
Rich, the fact is, he should have put it in the
That cross by  Geates What a ned!

They're not going to in interview anybody with you.
Oh!
No, they might send me an application form back and then  I'll send it back to them  and they get an interview.
Seems a  when you're going for a bloody job!
You know, cos they're wanting another part-timer to do seventeen hours.
Oh yeah.
And men don't particularly want that.
 
Oh yeah.
I said somebody like a middle-aged woman would be best who's got grown up children at work 
Yeah.
and this, this guy came for it  and, obviously Lynn can't say, we don't want to take a ma man on it'll be  sex discrimination.
Yeah.
But it won't be suitable, I mean, one he's bloody crap!
And erm  , it's only seventeen hours, it's four hours a day  so that's why it would suit somebody who's married.
Is he a nice bloke?
No!
He's just stupid!
He's, he's already come in for one form  put it, he's obviously filled one form in, he came up and he said can I have an application form for that job in the window, so I gave him one  and he went, oh well I've just filled one in.
I thought  I thought, did he just say can I have  can I have an application form or here's an application form?
And I looked at him, and he went  , no I made a mistake on it.
So he sto , do you know where the two tills are downstairs do you?
Yeah.
They were on the erm  the main one we use 
Yeah.
just by the step in, he was stood, resting on the erm  perspex thing  that is, that is erm  till guard, and he's stood writing it on there cos he thought there was nowhere else.
And  stood blocking like, how I get round to the till!
And you just couldn't absolutely see anything  serving customer  I was going to so , to move  or change out my draw  shutting it up, turning it off, going away  and somebody else had come, he kept, kept, kept doing that and he was stood there all the time and I thought  I thought you definitely won't get the job!
Well you're, you're not bloody suitable for it cos you keep getting  under my bloody feet!
And then 
How old is he?
I dunno.
Probably about twenty three I think.
And he's filled all the front in and the back, like, referees and everything  and he said  inside you've got to give your details of your erm  employment history  and he'd not put anything in, said I didn't know whether to put anything on there cos I'm on a Y P.
I said, what you mean a Y T S?
He sa , and he looked and he went  yeah, Y T.
And I says, well  you know, is it, is it a job?
You've got to put it down.
And he went, well no it's not a job.
I said, well what is it then?
He said, well I'm training.
I said, well training to do what?
He says I'm training on a Y T S.
Jesus Christ!
Is he really thick or what!
I still don't know what he's doing!
He were working for an erm  Macro or something.
Macro?
Yeah.
Well maybe.
Oh I'm, I'm thinking of Macro  Macro wholesalers.
Well I know Macro.
And when he went, as he went, she says oh I don't think he'll have much choice, er, much chance do you?
And we got this mad bloke come in!
And  the amount of people come in, with a cigarette  I have to go up and tell them that it's a no-smoking area and they look at me as if I'm stupid!
Did I tell you about that bloke the other week who got, the one who just cocky with me?
Ooh God!
He really got my back up!
This young lad about  probably about twenty three, twenty four, and he came in with a cigarette and I said excu excuse me but I'm afraid it's a no-smoking area.
And he looked at me, and he said well have you got any, he go , started like tutting and said well have you got any signs up?
And I must have been in a really funny mood, and I said yes we have it's on the till and he went  well I suggest you get them in the windows then!
And I felt like saying fuck off and  get out !
But I thought  they're obvious, do you know what I mean?
It's like  going to a firework factory and  sparking up a cigarette you just wouldn't do it would you?
You wouldn't!
And this bloke come in today  and erm  looked a bit, looked a bit like a tramp  didn't quite catch what he said, I'm sure he said  God sent me in here for a cigarette!


I said,, I said I'm sorry it's a no-smoking area.
And he looked at me, give me a really horrible look as well!
Felt like going  you know, how when somebody put a lot of hate in their eyes?
That's very, bad as what you give 
No.
me every day.
I can't do it.
You know like th if you look at someone  and they always say your eyes  are the souls  o yo , like your soul aren't they?
You can always read people's eyes, especially with your kind of facial expressions, cos the eyes always tell the truth.
And he looked u like he really hated me!
Probably did!
What, cos I told him  he couldn't smoke?
No!
Probably just hates everybody!
Probably, yeah.
Yeah, he was a bit weird!
Ooh!
Get off!
Just    Hope he's not late.
Yeah, so do I.
What time is it?
Half seven.
I don't know.
I think he picks me up after Coronation Street, are you going to be here?
Yeah.
I wish I got this fish in butter.

As simple as that!
Come in!
Hi!
Cos you're sti still on tape so can you speak up.
Ah right!
Even up to the last.
Very good!
  

Right, now there's a few questions I've gotta ask you 
Ooh!
and I thought  now
Sorry, it's so cold .
Right.
Erm  first thing, how many erm  erm  how many tapes have you used?
I thought I'd used eleven
Yeah.
but I've only, in fact, used ten because  someone took the microphone in and put it back in the wrong place.
Right.


So that's just ten.
Right!
Erm so  Haley paid you the comp , the booklet you filled in.
Everyone .
So hotel is right?
Right.
Er, now  thinking of the experience of recording your conversations using the personal stereo and filling in the booklet how do you find this in general?
Er  doing the tape's is okay.
Erm  you occasionally forget it's there  which makes your conversation more natural but  you also forget to turn the tape over
Right.
every forty five minutes.
Well, if you did you do, you'd use a damn sight more than twenty tapes a week so 
Yeah.
Erm
Filling the booklets a bit of a pain!
So she's  
Yeah, hang on a minute!
Erm
Sorry!
Just supposed to be word for word but it's a bit of a  erm  Right, filling in booklet's a  er a bit of a pain.
Yeah.
Did you have any problems?
No!
I must say that, no I mean a , by being a pain I mean er  just try and remember to fill it in or do th people speaking with you.
With all
Yeah.
But generally speaking, you know, did you have any problems or
No.
No.
Yeah.
That's alright.
Erm  of the conversations you had during the week about how many of them would you say you recorded?
Erm  most of them.
Did you tend to count these?
The next one is er  thinking about the conversations you did not record which of these was the main reason why they weren't recorded  please just read out the numbers on the card.
Can you read more than one 
Yeah.
or
Yeah.
Yeah?
Erm  one  er  four  seven.
And er  were there any other reasons  not  on the card?
Erm  I think  of those.
Yes.
Yeah?
Erm  now, do you know anybody you spoke to, right?
Yes.
Yes.
did anyone you spoke to during the time you were recording object to being recorded?
No.
There i , there are a number of things that might affect the way in which we speak and how we use language in every day conversation, such as where we live, where we went to school, what 
 
hobbies and interests we have and so on.
So I'd like to ask you er, I'll move on and ask you a few questions about places you've lived in the past.
