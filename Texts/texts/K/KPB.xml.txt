That means  half, put the note in half, so what's half of two?
One crotchet one.

Go on you do that one.
You've got a dotted four, dotted semigrave.
Right.
Half of four is two.
Mhm.
Add another two
Mm.
is four.
Alright.
Just  you got four, here's four, yeah?
Right.
You wanna find out what half of four is.
Yeah.
You don't actually half it but you work it out, it's two.
Yeah.
So you get those two and you add them on the end.
Yeah.
That's six.
Okay?
Same with two, you've got two you ge , cut them in half, add one.
Oh right, to make three.
Three.
Ah right.
So erm  that's this, you wouldn't get this one, but what about eight?
A dotted eight on.
And you cut it

Twelve, yeah.
So let's try a higher one.
Right.
Twelve itself.
Twelve right.
Cut it in half, six  you add  four?
No you add six onto twelve.
Add six  to twelve
Because twelve is the number you started with, yeah?
Start
Mm.
the number you start with, you keep that in your head  and you always add the number you find out onto that.
So if that's been cut in half,
Mm.
you always add  the other half
Yeah, you add wha 
onto the twelve?
Yeah, d'ya know.
 
The number you cut in half
Yeah.
remember how it was in the first place  so if you cut four in half, remember four
Yeah.
and add half of four.
Oh, so that makes six.
Yeah.
Alright.
Yeah.
Do it to eight.
Right eight.
Right you cut it in four, so that's four  but you remember the eight, so you add the other four
Mhm.
which is twelve.

Okay.
The Serbs and all those are signing a peace agreement.

So what does that mean?
That means that er sa , America says they won't do  bomb them or anything yet.
No?
That's a shame.
But erm  they've told them that they better keep to the peace agreement.
It's ratified by the Bosnian government it's gotta be.
They've signed the  bands agreement right?
But if they don't, if they break it or that then er  they expect  some trouble.
I was talking about  er er erm, cannabis and opium and things like that last night, now, I'm sure I'm right and these others were wrong, how do you get opium?
It's sta you erm  draw up
Describe how you think 
it's the seeds of er
Is it the seeds?
Hang on, let me think.
Let me, maybe, I dunno.
Cos they reckon it's the 
Ga hang on!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't say what they think.
Mm.
I know you gotta dry something off.
Well they reckon it's the seeds of the poppy.
No it's not, cos you, you eat them.
I don't believe that.
You can eat poppy seeds.
I, d'ya know that, do you know our poppies in the garden, those big ones?
Yeah.
Do you when I sa , if you split them at the edge, do you know when the things  died off, the poppies there?
Yeah.
And when it's still green  if you get a little knife and just slit down like that, a sap comes out, all 
Yeah.
sa sa sap.
It's not
It's a white sap substance.
Because on, you have poppy seeds on rolls.
Yeah.
Black seeds, those are poppy seeds.
That's right.
But er, is a, this sap comes out, right?
Yeah, and you dry that.
And that's what 
So 
it's opium isn't it?
And it turns to what?
Is it a powder?
I think so.
A white powder.
Int that what they collect?
I'll ask Kay.
Don't they scrape it off?
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
Ooh!
None of them agree.
Ooh no that's wrong.
Who's none?
Er erm
Was it Mum?
Don, well Mum wasn't 
What did Mum say?
certain.
This Don and his wife and  er Gail and her husband, you know  intelligent people.
You should have told them that  about the poppy seeds.
You should have said, you eat poppy seeds on rolls.
Yeah!
Cos you do.
Yeah!
Well they even said that!
I dunno but, I would have thought Mum would have said that.
Yeah.
But no!
No, no one thought that was right.
There was still arguments.
Did you, did tha that come up about eating them?
Poppy seeds?
Someone said about the poppy, you can eat poppy seed, but  then someone else said  no wonder I was addicted to rolls, you know, poppy seeds rolls, but  erm  no I didn't argue about it, I just oh well okay, that's  fine.
I said I thought it was that way but, you know, agreed with them.
But I'm sure I was right and they were wrong.
Do you know what I find amazing?
Mm mm?
How the shop in Trungeon Square  the Chinese restaurant right
Yes this
stays open?

You never see anyone in it.
No.
Do you think it's a front for something?
Chinese laundry.
Unless it's  cos they live there as well don't they?
Yeah.
Maybe.
So that's  like their accommodation.
Whereas other people  I wonder if they lived in their one.
Probably don't do they?
What one?
The other people  in the other shops, would they live  in them do you think?
Ah ah!
Would the  newsagent live, they'd live in there wouldn't they?
No they don't.
