It's ever so nice in there Emma!
I went there, I had to go there this week for work.
You know when you go in the car park you have to get a token to get out.
Do you?
So when I parked my car I said to them  I forgot how much it was in there, twenty pounds  in the hotel  as you're not a guest they give them in reception.
I said well it's alright cos I went to this er  presentation there.
What to stay?
And she said yeah.
Anyway, when I went to go I had to go to the desk give you a token, this token lifts the barrier up.
I suppose for people who put the 
Put  and cars in there, I mean cars in there ain't there?
Yeah.
Look at them !
Why?
I should think they in case you  wouldn't have been there would they?

I think  ought to cut them out.
Erm  I know you brought it with you Chris, so it must 
Something

Did I put down Emma, in the back?
No, it's there.

We are now approaching East Midlands airport.
Weather outside is rather cloudy.
Rather.
It's very low there.
It's only six degrees centigrade.
Minus one!
Flipping heck!
We must get the far better weather .
Mm.

I do 
But 
but you didn't like it much did you?
No.
Hey?
No.
But 
If I went back I'd go to er, I probably go to Sousse or somewhere like that.
Pardon Emma?
Didn't you like it in Tunisia?
Er
I felt a bit intimidating and
Very much so.
I don't like the people's attitude Emma.
I know they can't help it, it's their way of living but
Their culture.
er, unfortunately er  they made me feel very uncomfortable.
And it's not just me that
That's Donnington Thistle Emma.
There.
You didn't go in the pool though did you dad?
No.
they're all up today.
Mm.
Did you stop the night there?
No!
Ha!
Tt!
Need a nightie surely!


Carry on mum.
I don't know.
That car's always here.
Must be a person that works on the
On the gates.
gate.
That's Joan  innit?
Thank you.
Is it one where you have to keep it with you?
No.
You pay it when you get back out there.
Er no , but one of them  collected these ones.
No, it's at ta Birmingham that is.
I know there's one where you used to have to keep it.
It's
Watch it!
There's a car coming!
Over the bridge, what's this?
She's got something stuck up her bo bottom.
Yeah.
She's got somebody stuck up her bottom.


What's the matter?
You know what.
We 
Four add four and then 
Four add four equals eight.
Two times four equals eight, right?
Yeah, like that.
And then two 
And  two times four is eight.
Erm I didn't write it like that then.
Right.
Share the total of fives
Yeah, I done, yeah I done 
Er 
Five, five, five is fifteen.
Five add five add five
Erm is fifteen.
and then erm .
Right.
Is fifteen.
And then 
And sixes 
Sixes  six 
si 
add six add six 
add six 
add six
is thirty six.
Right.
Six times six is thirty 
I've done that one.
sixes.
That's it.
Okay?
Erm  this.
I'll leave that out.
Leave that out.
Add them up.
Mm.
That much closer   can use those pictures.
Take a look.
Are they near the box?
Yeah.
Is that right?
Four 
Four is twenty!
So it's four  so
Four times five is
Twenty!
Four times five equal twenty.
Er  two times  six equals twelve.
Er  four times three equal twelve.
Er, two additions left.
Alright.
Those two add?
So it's like one, two, one, two and one there and  but put like  erm  seven add seven  add seven is .
Is twenty one.
Yeah.
Seven add seven add seven is twenty one 
One.
And three times seven
Right.
is twenty one  and do it that way, five and fives.
Okay?
Two addition questions.
Hang on.
Two ad yeah but you've got right two multiple  and two addition equations.
Not equations!
You told us this!
But i thi , like these, these are equations.
So  two addition equations  er  three times se seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one.
Right?
Oh!
A so, but you can also go
Yeah.
Yeah add three.
Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one.
Do it that way on.
Do you follow 
Yeah.
me?
Yes I do.
Right.
Two multiplication
Yeah.
and two addition.
Two addition.
Right.
So you, like, you .
Yes, that's right.
Then, it's like erm 
One.
seven times three, and three times seven.
And three times seven.
That's right.
And you do the same there.
Same on the adds.
And then, this  we do  like
Right, she wants currency in two divisions  in each, right?
So it's  one, two, three, four,fi 
That multiplication is a 
yeah well divisions, okay, so it's twenty one shared by  say, if that's one, two, three, four, five, six int it?
Oh I know what I've got!
Six times three is eighteen  or three times six is eighteen.
I know what I've done.
I've put the, I thought it was  er  okay.
Six.
And division is shared by.
So you got to do eighteen shared by  six is three  and eighteen
Have you got
shared by three is six.
So like, you go one, two, three, four, five, six  six times  you swap 
Three.
six times three 
times three is eighteen 
is three times six.
Six.
Yeah, and and you got 
Six times three and three times six.
A and division is  eighteen shared by  three  is six, and eighteen shared by six is three!
Yeah?
Got it?
I cannot read  .
Three sixes are eighteen!
You got it?
And you do the same there?
Hang on!
I haven't finished  thirty three 
 
one yet.
That's what I don't get.
Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I don't a get how you do that?
Is it, would you like us to put
It's fours int it?
It's fours 
No two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve
Yeah.
It 
That's twos.
No, but it's going to fours look.
It's going to  fours.
Alright.
Going into fours.
What would I put?
Er  one four is four, two fours are eight, and thre three fours is twelve.
As  this is been shared by  lines int it?
Yeah and it's on that one.
You do it like that do you?
Yeah, cos it's being shared by
Oh!
So it's, I would say that is  er  nine times four equals thirty six.
And on that one is  er, sixty three shared by nine  six time  sixty three divided by nine
four.
No!
Sixty three divided by  nine is six!
Write six through it.
Ten six  innit?
No, it's ten sixes.
No, no wait a minute.
Nines.
What should nine times ten Emma?
One nine is nine, two nines are eighteen, three nines  are
Twenty seven.
Four nines are thirty six, five nines are forty five, six nines fifty four, seven nine are sixty three.
Oh thank you.
Right.
Yeah, seven nines are sixty three.
Hang on a minute!
Six nines are
seven nines are sixty three.
Hang on a minute!
Seven
Seven nines are sixty three!
Sixty three.
Yeah.
You work them out like that look.
Yeah.
Well seven nines, well ee er, it takes you so long 
Look one , one nine is nine
Yeah.
Two nines are  eighteen.
So that one there is  sixes into si thirty six.
I know!
But I still don't get what you have to write!
Well multiplication equation for this number line  I would say is  er  I've already told you that.
No, but I don't know what I have to, I have to write!
Eight times four equals thirty six.
Don't get it.
Because it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven  eight, no sorry, nine times four is thirty six.
Nine times four equals thirty six.
Like this look!
Write it out on a piece of paper and you'll  and I'll write them down.
No!
You do it yourself!
I've told you what to do.
You do it like that.
I don't get it though!
I'll tell you if it's right.
I'm just writing the answers out for you!
I told you what to do.
That's lazy!
Int it?
You crafty cow!
If I give you a bit of paper and the lot, yeah well you know what to do and go to school and  fill them in!
Couldn't it ?
No!
Hey?

Look just watch her, she's going to tell you how to record and you can see.
Can't see yet.
Ooh!
Cor!
I was in deep sleep!
Right, triangle times nine over for thirty six.
Thirty six.
Shared by nine is   have to work out what it is.
Go on then.
I don't know if they're right though.
Where is it darling?
I've got to put a film in.
This?
Yeah.
Cor!
Four nines are thirty six.
There you are look.
But you see there's enough!
Oh yes I know.
It's a as I say, it's all part of a times table.
That's 
 
all you've got to remember.
Well I am trying.
Right four   is forty, eighty six.
And thirty six shared by nine is four.
Emma.
And I've asked you to do something and you've done neither!
This is more important than anything!
Move that!
