Right, let me have a look at this first before, you pour a cup of tea and I'll have a look at this form 
That's probably not the best one cos that's er, that's not the normal form.
Never mind, aids with that?

Yeah, but it makes it very difficult, if you got a play off, it gets, if you get people on the same  same score
Well you have to, you have to call for them then
Yeah I know but they don't turn up and you get all tangled up  all over the place
Oh I'd let them come, I'd let them come whenever you can get them cos we've got so many of them it's 
Well they're given a time to turn up in a group aren't they?

wheelchair slalom last year d'ya remember?
Oh I was stuck on the quoits, I never saw anything except

Where are you going?

Why are you camping?
To save money for the students, cos we might
Well they'll only complain you know
Pardon?
they'll only complain even if you try and save money for them
Well  I'm just tr 
I say you don't have to camp do you?
Of course I'll have to camp as well 
Why, you don't have to save money, stay in the centre 
Tt, I probably could, but I don't think it, it would go down very well with the students
Well they can't have it both ways  if they can afford to save money they can,but if they don't, then stay in the centre   
I couldn't stay in the centre, there wasn't space in the centre
Oh

Surely he was closer
the kids are at school in Brecon 
Now why isn't he choosing centres that are down there or is there
less to their relationship than meets the eye?
Well it's, I, I, almost, I asked
You almost asked him if  he'd split up  with his wife 
er I said, er, all I said to him was that, erm, he said, he said he was going back er up, up and down most weekends to er
mm
to Wales, so he could be with her mind, er and he said well I've got the job I want and she's got the job she wants, erm, we're both happy in our work 
But surely he was closer to her in erm ?

and then they're going to have er 
 
they're gonna cook the evening meal on the er, on the Tuesday night and er, they're going to, we're going, we're going to have fish and chips on the Wednesday night
mm
tt and Thursday they're going to the luxury end, they're going to  they're going to see Paul and John
Hope they clean up before they go there
and er from there we er  head for, we're going to see Dave  at Gillhead and then we're coming home
mm  and do the students know all this?
Do they know they're camping?
Oh yes, yes, cos they're the ones, they're, they're the ones who wanted to, to camp
Well if they're the ones who wanted to camp I think you should go in there, you should er go in the
Well what's happening is they want  they wanted to save money
mm
and also I can do a little bit of a fiddle
yes
because it can count as their as part of their 
 
their camping experience for Beta award
oh well that's
it saves me having to do three weekends, I can do two weekends next term instead of three
is this the B Tech Beta is it?
Yeah the B Tech Beta award, tt, then the weekend after that I was going, Peter's group's cancelled
Which group's that?
erm  it was the information technology group
Mm
my usual yearly group
and they've cancelled?
Er, well  had a ca had a contract
Mm
for twelve hours, which was about two hundred and thirty quid
yes
er, I've signed the contract, the contracts has been handed, gone through the system
oh
er, our new esteemed leader
your new one the principal 
the new principal has said it will not, contract will not be honoured
why?
Can't 
cos 
afford it?
educational cutbacks
Oh
so that means it's er 
it's, they're not going
oh Peter said er just cancel it, he said oh, I said I know that Dick would, would go without, without payment
no
but I'm not prepared to let, let him go
well I don't see why he should
well they're not my students
oh  and you've got better things to do with your own time 
I could have done with the two hundred and thirty quid though
Well I know, but er
Well that'll pay the ferry
I know, I know it would have done
which is what I was relying on it
mm
and I don't know what's gonna happen with my contract with nursery nurses in June then
Well er, is any other servicing being done?
Is everybody getting their contract through?
No
Well I think you can wave bye-bye to that
I'm a bit annoyed to say the least, Peter's
Hopping
hopping mad
Well they should of said beforehand, before you got your hopes up
Yeah especially as er, I'll have to go and speak to er must get hold of John
John who?
John 
perhaps  still tell him we've cancelled, we're cancelling
Yes  well they can always fill the hostel can't they?
Yeah 
Never mind we can go to the Lakes instead
so, er, I've still got the nursery nurses
Well we'll check that er
no we'll check that you can still go with them, before Philip, cos Phil and Liz would appreciate an early warning
Yeah
if they can't, we'd better enquire about that  I wonder how little  went on with his knee?
Yeah
He would have been alright
I think we'd have heard something
mm 
so er, I've got two Beta awards, weekends to do, I could do one Peter's weekend now
Mm 
that erm, that would mean I've just got one to do after half term, that er
Well why are you doing that with them?
If they, erm don't need it anyway.
What d'ya mean?
Do they need the Beta award?
It's, it's a, it's an award, er  it's the module if they haven't got any awards really, I will, I'll arrange for them to do er first aid
Mm
do their St John's first aid next term 
they don't appreciate it do they?
No 
So do they see this as an imposition or
no 
do they have to get
I mean they're the ones who are badgering me for, for qualifications, they're badgering me for, I, I, I just told them straight that I will do it for them because I, I won't get paid for it
mm 
on one condition
What?
the condition is there must be at least of 'em who are prepared to go, to bring me the money for the registration
mm
for the first day of next term, and once I've got that money and they're registered 
you'll have a go
I'll have a go, but I'm not going to do it for two or three
No, don't see why you should.
How much does it cost?
Ten pounds
Erm 
that says, tt, six pound, er, tt, three pound ten insurance and six pound ninety registration  so that should sort that out
Blimey you'll know soon enough won't ya?
that's one thing for certain those weekends for averaging
Oh how's it, how is this averaging working out?
Not getting me for any extra hours that's a certain fact
Well you put enough in
er because they actually, I mean, the week, the week in Scotland we should have got overtime for that, but we haven't
But that's averaged in is it?
That's supposedly averaged in, yes, the fact is that Jenny and I both put in something like, well, it was five, forty, forty five hours plus technically that is classified as forty five hours class contact a week
mm
it's five nine hour days, five, three session days  and er 
well why didn't you get paid overtime?
Because our esteemed leader won't pay it.
So will you get time off in lieu?
Oh technically get time off, time off in lieu, but I can't take it, so
Well do you think it's time that you started taking time off in lieu?
Make it erm
I can't, you can't, cos they won't let you take time off in lieu unless  if it involves them having to employ somebody else to cover 
But that's not the point, that's not time off is it?
I can, the only time off in lieu you can take is, is D and D time.
But you're off anyway
Well I'm not off, I'm just working in the off in the office, so I can take possibly some Thursday mornings off
Well, don't you think you ought to?
Well I can't take any time off until after the exams, once the exams are over
Well what do the unions say about this, I mean
Well, the best way is to be ill after, after, after half term
Like most of us, that probably explains why a few people are
I mean at the moment, I mean from that one week
mm
they owe me twenty one hours, twenty, twenty eight hours
mm
er, from, I should get paid for the disabled games
yes 
I hope to God I do get paid for that
well how much do you expect for that?
I expect six hours
Yeah, will that pay the ferry?
No, six hours is a, that'll be er, about a hundred quid
Oh it'll pay for a bit of the ferry  but has, has no one approached the unions?
Er, I got paid, I got paid for the disabled games last year
Mm
so I should, er, that should have set the precedent, I get paid for it this year
well you got paid for your contracts, they let your contracts through the last time
er, then, so that's at least, well in fact that's more than sufficient, I should get paid more than six hours because I've been working on the students, on the disabled games all day Friday
mm
and probab er probably Thursday morning as, as well, so I'll probably have Thursday, Friday  maybe Saturday, well, oh I should have, because by working on the games Thursday morning, that's another three hours, that's, brings me up to , twenty eight, yes twenty eight er  er thirty one  and er, I'll, I've got class top contacts time in the, in the afternoon, so that doesn't count, Friday I've got class, a two hour class, but er, tt, I'll be working outside, in fact that class will be cancelled that day, so it's er, so  four hours that's thirty six er, Saturday  forty two, Tuesday  erm  tt, oh that week  I'll have a  six for Wednesday er  nine Thursday  er twelve  for Tuesday another twelve, plus the evening twelve, plus two, plus another six, that's eight and a half, eighteen, another eighteen hours
mm
for that week
well what happens if you average more hours than you're supposed to average?
so, so, so what have I then forty two, so that's six and that's sixty hours
What was the, what was the point in averaging in the first place?
To make sure you worked a certain amount of time during the year?
Yes, to make certain that er, you didn't er have any time off, it, any time free after the, after the students have finished their exams
Oh, so what happens if you
all this, all this, it is, it is for, cos what they're trying, what they're trying to work is the fact that er you're supposed to have twenty one hours' class contact
Yeah
and if er, what they're trying to do is  so that you work say twenty three hours  the class contact, you, you can't be averaged for more than two hours a week, so you need twenty three hours for the first two terms
mm
and er
that makes up for the time you, then doing the
after the exams or something like that, yes
but you, if you're due for time off in lieu, couldn't you take, couldn't you say that erm  use that for the averages?
Tt, well at  at the moment I am therefore due in actual fact two weeks' holiday
That's a stupid situation
and if, and if I do two Beta award weekends
mm
I'm due three weeks' holiday
well er 
so it's er 
what happens if you're actually averaging more than twenty one hours throughout the year?
If I was doing more than my twenty one hours throughout the year 
Do you get paid overtime?
you're supposed to get paid overtime 
And will you be?
No


no overtime is being paid
And have people stopped doing the work?
The interesting thing is some departments are still doing overtime
They're being paid?
Yeah, but, but our dep our, our department our fat slob won't allow it  won't let us have any overtime
He wants time off in lieu.
he wants you to have time off in lieu
Well then why don't you take time off in lieu?
I can't take time off in lieu cos I haven't got any lieu time to take off
You must have, you, you must have  you keep telling me that you're doing all these extra hours and you're owed two weeks' holiday
Well  on a Monday okay I have an hour in the morning, I have the first hour in the morning  and er  oh God .
What you forgotten?
well this er, I've got this class on, on, they've amalgamated the two classes together so
Yeah
so now I have Monday afternoon D and D, so it's, I have four hours on, on Monday
And you can't come home cos you'll be doing a split shift on the
I can't come home because I'm, I'm working four thirty to seven thirty  or five or, five till eight
Thursday mornings you could take off
I can't now because the class, the Monday night's 
 
class has now been put on to Thursday morning
Monday nights?
the Monday
Afternoon.
afternoon, erm from this week
What about Friday?
I've got the uniform services  I'll have er four, four fitness training on a Thursday morning
Well er
so I've got er
where does that leave you your free time?
Well
Besides Monday afternoon
I've got Monday afternoon
mm
I've got nine hours D and D, I've got four hours on a Monday
yeah
er, nine till eleven on a Friday, that's, that's six, and er two fifteen to four fifteen
Well why don't you go in late on a Friday?
plus eight  pardon?
Why don't you go in late, go in for eleven o'clock on a Friday
I can't do that because it's, a Friday morning is team meetings time
Where?
meetings with the principal, meetings with  this, that and everything
Well wouldn't it be making a point if erm everybody who was owed this time took it regardless
the only time I can possibly take off 
get militant about it
is Friday afternoon
Well and why don't ya?
I, I er, looks like  erm teaching eleven fifteen to one fifteen  my lunch hour is say one fifteen to two fifteen  and technically I can er  have it, I could probably, I could be, take off Friday afternoon, it's the only time I could take off for averaging
Well I wish you would
that's the only time I can take off time off in lieu, which is annoying
Well why'd, I wish you would and I wish you'd er, they'd be a, what you needs is a concerted comprehensive effort from everybody  be inconvenient as possible until the money stumps up  don't know where the money comes from though 
I don't know what to do, tt I can't really take that  them all  take that er  I don't want to kick the boat too hard
Why?
Tt, cos I don't want to be made redundant by being awkward
Well not until you're fifty anyway 
I can't afford to go at fifty, I've gotta go till fifty five
What if they offered you ten years' redundant?
I couldn't even afford that because I haven't worked, even enough on my AVCs 
Aye  
I've got to get that those AVCs er, I mean if I had to, if that happened, how would we pay off Brian?
Mm
How would the, I wouldn't have any money from the AVCs either 
aye, well, just keep, keep on trucking
so it's keep
five years
so it's keep a high profile on the, on useful things and keep a low profile on the, on the others
mm, mm  aye 
the only way of doing it, except you know, you're known for, for all the good things, the good things you do  just make certain that er  we don't rock the boat  so you, so you 
you crawled 
you crawl and slave
yes, this is life.
What do you want as your little birthday present?
I don't know
Neither do I, that's why I'm asking you, cos I won't have time to shop
A Magi light torch then
What's a Magi light torch?
Where do I get one of them?
Steve's
Right  has he got one?
Well he had one earlier in the year
Oh, right, what's the Magi light torch?
Just a little pocket, a little tiny, tiny torch with a very strong beam
Mm, mm, right, well you need a torch actually
mm
those head torches aren't very reliable 
it's that or a new head torch, but if I got a new head torch it, it perhaps  but they're about, they're about thirty quid I think
Well we've got one that doesn't work
the  one?
Yeah
Oh it's all 
the one Jim give you
yeah  I never got it working
No
but I never tried really  but they're the best ones you can buy
Yeah.
There was a bit in the paper today about er Ratners, in the Samuels outlet selling carriage clocks for three hundred pounds and claiming that they are solid mahogany cases, but as they're chipboard with a mahogany veneer, and er they've been had by the Trades Descriptions Act, three, who would pay three hundred pounds  for a mahogany one anyway?
Couldn't get away with three
And how can they get away with charging three hundred pounds?
For a w for a carriage clock 
Well, when you can pay fifteen hundred pounds for a watch
Yes but you expect the value in it
Ah, well what value is it, a watch tells the time  whether it's three hundred pounds or three, three pounds
Or Mickey Mouse, yes  it just depends on the, the metals used in it, the jewellery on it, the movement
mm 
the maker's name    it must be bedtime now Dick
It must be getting close
mm, do you need a bath?
I could do with one I suppose
Well there's plenty of hot water  you'd better get packing tomorrow night
Mm, get packing during the day
get packing, mm 
cos I'm not going to work tomorrow
good 
it is my day off, let's face it 
Well you won't have a car, well you would
Oh I will, cos I'll have the Peugeot won't I?
Yes, they've got on quite well with the erm wall at the back, but there's, Geoff's got his car outside and the skip was in the police access road rather than ours
The skip's up there now?
Mm 
Cos the skip was at the end there this, this morning, it was there at lunchtime, er, well when I went in
It was there in the morning, they've moved it since, I suppose they move it to where they're working but
Aye, probably er, it's probably mean it's a new skip probably
Mm
the other one was full
are they going to put railings up to the same height as the wall?
No
What are they going to do?
They're putting a flat coping up 
Well, mm, won't that make it very easy for terrorists to, to hop over the low wall and avoid the enormous nine foot gate they've got, sticking up like a sore thumb now  wouldn't that be rather redundant?
Yeah  totally redundant
Will they now take it down?
I doubt it
I suppose it's to stop cars parking up now is it?
That would be the sensible thing, to remove that gate down to the far end
Aye, yes 
but  tt, it would probably  cost more to go and take it down then it would be to, to get a new gate
I don't know what's supporting it, and they're going to erm   are they?
I would think so  they've gotta go and plant, start planting ivies and things to drape down the wall 
I hope they're going to support the wall at the, our end  they've done nothing, I suppose they've just taken it down, but they must be doing something to underpin it or bolster it
Not that I know of, er, I mean 
Have you spoken to them?
I've spoken to the guy and he's, said the architect was coming at lunchtime
Mm
at two o'clock this afternoon, er, because he was, he thought they ought to go on, totally rebuild of the fire on the 
Fire 
corner particularly
yeah, well they need to  what the main building?
Yeah
And the architectures needs to 
cos it was hitting the wall, the whole thing was, you could watch the vibrations coming down the wall 
What, just, it's not a safe road then is it?
No
Especially if it's been loosened and clobbered.
Did he call the architect in?
Or was the architect due to come in?
The architect was due to come anyway.
Yeah
So how far have they got now?
Well they're down by Anita and Bob's
Oh they've just got on well
mm
they were outside us about er eleven o'clock
mm  er yeah they should be done by  Friday I should think  cos if all they're doing is putting a coping edge on  it'll make it look nicer at the back.
Yes, it'll give it more light
Mm
to the yard, to the, not to the yard but to the
to the lane
to the lane 
they must do something about the park court this summer, get the perspex sheeting renew renewed
and er  get some lead sheeting to, have to go and chip out the, out of the wall
Which wall?
Elsie's wall  so that the water doesn't come down here, down the wall  what you need to do is put the, lead sheeting  chipping out from the, the block, chip, chip into the, the rendering, put lead sheeting into it, cement the rendering back in again
Mm  we need 
so so you, you've got a seal because otherwise all that happens is that er  er you put the cement onto the, every time the, the water gets down the back of the cement, down the wall
Mm, I think we need to call, we get, get a builder in because we need that, that roof seeing to at the back.
That's gonna be expensive 
Well, can't be helped, I mean we can't have water coming through that, that's down the soil pipe, can't have that open for ever
What's it like then I wonder?
Well it's still coming in  it wasn't desperate, but it's still coming in 
Dunno where it's coming from actually
No, that's the problem with flat roofs, bet we need a yard seeing, we need a   we need a, effort in the yard
Alright I can do that then two weeks before you break up
I don't, I don't think it's a job we can do, maybe if we get erm Angela's building contractor  there's one or two little building jobs that we need, there's the damp patch in the chimney breast in there.
I'd ignore that
You can't ignore it  it's the first thing a buyer will, a buyer's survey will pick up, especially as it was mentioned in our survey 
Oh that means we've gotta totally dec redecorate that room
Well I want to do that anyway
Oh bloody hell  I hate 
more upheaval 
What?
More upheaval for ya 
Yeah, exactly  unnecessary
It's not unnecessary
I mean it's not that long since that room was done
When was it done then?
I don't know
Well then
oh
and as you don't have anything to do with the decorating anyway I don't know what you're peeved about  you like it before and then you like it after, and you're quite content to let me do the bit in the middle.
How much longer?
I don't know
Well let's have a, let's go to bed
Oh go and get this, finish this side off
Well how much longer is there on it?
I can't see  it's very close to the end
Oh well
so we might as well get that forty five minutes finished
oh yeah   I've run out of conversation now  you'll have to record Star Trek for me tomorrow.
As long as I haven't got to watch it
There was a nice moggy programme on yesterday.
Was there?
yeah
What time was that on?
Half eight, Desmond Morris, Tiger and  showed you how a cat could use a door knob 
Mm, how'd he get up to it?
Well it must have been a tall, a long cat and a low door  but it would lift the knocker and knock its way in 
Must of been a tiger what the, well couldn't have been a cat
It was a cat
a cat, no cat'd, can reach a door knob
This one could, it could just about reach it over its paw and flicked it up and knocked on the door
That's huge
it doesn't matter, I've got it on tape  cats are  
there is no way a cat no way a cat can reach that door knob
Well there's no way our cat could  but this cat did
It must have been bloody huge
Well perhaps it was  it was a long  I don't know, but it did and I'll show you on the video if you want
Oh I don't want to watch the video
You don't like moggies?
No
You do
I don't like moggies 
lots of little black cats
I'll tell you one thing, nineteen ninety three had better come round
So you can take Puddy abroad
yeah, cos I'm not er paying, I'm not giving up my summer holidays and  I want me five weeks
then Puddy will be able to have a pet passport, anti-rabies shot and she's away
Trouble is when, they take her abroad and travel in a caravan
Well by that time we'll be into caravans won't we?
cos I think we're going to lock her up during the day
Mm, you can't lock her in a tent can you?
No  she'd do too much damage to a tent as well 
Mm, mm she might do
What, might, would do, let's face it
Well she can only scratch it inside 
she'd be climbing in the inside of it and ripping it
like Russell mouse, Russell 
yeah 
mouse does more damage than Puddy
What damage did he do?
Why he chewed the apron
Oh yes he did 
little mouse  the apron 
that's right he did yes the sod 
Yeah  
What was that I told him, called?
Randolf, because he went under the car and then he  off    can you post my, the thing to the A A tomorrow?
Yes 
Telling them where they can put their cards  in the best possible term 
That's ridiculous
well they must realize that they've undercut us considerably by everybody else
that's, that seemed like a total hundred percent that was
I know 
er, there wasn't much difference if you didn't go abroad
no 
but to, to go abroad three times, it'd be a hundred and, it'd cost two hun two hundred pounds
Extra?
Mm
Oh 
cos it's forty six, fifty four and sixty eight I think it was
mm 
and your membership on top of that
plus your   and your Home Start and your Relay
Mm  well I think this is, enough of this side
mm 
enough it might have just about finished, I think we'll stop it at that then 
fill the fill the thing
Hi
Hello there.
hello, how are you?
Very well thanks and yourself?
Yeah, not so bad
Yeah, good
I was just gonna say Dick, can you, I'll, I'll give you a ring back it's just that we're in the middle of eating
Rightio
so I'll give you a ring back as soon as we've finished.
Okey-doke
Okay
Okay

You can't see it there can you?
What?
The cream
No, well, I wasn't looking for it actually.
cos it wasn't in the er, in the first aid drawer.
I don't think we've unpacked it from when we went 
I can't remember unpacking it  it's not in the er  in the ski bag.

Can always get another one anyway, it'll always turn up later on 
One towel
One towel, right

so it's the sheet sleeping bag
sheet sleeping bag, two pillow cases, mm  two small towels 
I suppose we only really need two small towels to
Well you'll be bathing every night 
I suppose so, yes  now do you want, suppose we could use the, the two square  ski bags to put the bits in couldn't we?
No
As opposed to the one long one and the, and the one boot shape one  er, that's all yours is it, there is it?
Well you said you'd put in, yes it is basically
The only thing to go in is wash bags and they go in the small rucksack anyway, erm   do you want these pink ones?
Yes
I thought we'd, if I took that up across with us, we could put er ski clothing in that
yes and what sort of, have you packed me ski socks in?the blue socks have ya?
I've got here, I've got your long, two pairs of long johns
Mm I only actually need one pair of them

Right, well we'll just need to stuff it in the bag then.
Yeah, yeah, that's all that needs doing.
Right, when you, off you go then dear, you want to put that stuff in?
Yes, otherwise we'll
You're very good at stuffing, you're very good 
well, that's the one thing I'm expert at, yes, so, so says my birthday card

Yes
Mind you, you haven't, he doesn't know 


gone of the days of  records

certainly can't manage what I used to be able to 
Do you think we need all these socks?
Do you want that as, what are you wearing to go in?
Oh I'll wear this and me leggings  don't think we'll need to take a dressing gown do you?
Don't suppose so, no

That can go in the
the other bag

What, long johns?
Long skinny legs, green
Long green skinny legs and knee bolts, knee joints,colour

Er, no ladies always perspire
No ladies glow, men perspire or sweat

cos that's er, where it's available, mind you, you look quite fetching there, I think I might do, I might be tempted here
Yeah  what else have we got to put in then?
Can't think of anything, there's  everything else is in
The bag won't do up will it?
Sound very easy,no  complications
Haven't put a swimming costume in
Mm, you're not likely to go swimming
I don't know if there's swimming in  I mean places of 
There'll be swimming there.
Oh yes there's a wee bit of room still 
could of put in, could of put in there, six inches' worth in there 
been not, right what can we put in the pocket, erm, give us a scarf, anything, er
Put scarfs in
put towels in?
We've got the two towels, we've got the two towels
The two towels are in, the small two towels are in, the er, the
do we need a small towel actually in the overnight bag?
Mm, I suppose we could do with a tea towel size one, oh, I haven't got a tea towel in
Well, and  are taking four
Pardon?
they're taking four, it's on their list of four
Fo four
Yeah
four tea towels?
Yes


 

Hello  hello .
That was a waste of time, I thought that were being Paul actually
What he say?
They were right in a middle of a meal
Right 
Hello, hello there Dick it's Paul here
Hi.
Did you ring a moment ago?
Yes I did
Oh.
I didn't know whether I'd put in the right number and I thought well I'll, I won't let anyone answer it, I'll just re-dial.
Ah cos er I picked it up and said hello and that was it
Oh I see I must of just been putting it down at that time


I thought, oh I wonder if I've got the right number here  yeah but you're both well then?
Yes, we've got er, I think we're, we're just packing at the moment
Aha
er I think we're more or less set really.
ah that's great
How, how are you doing?
We're, we're sort of just about, you know there's the last minute things to put in, but, barring that, what we've done is to put it in a lot of small bags rather than big cases 
Yeah 
so it should slide in alright
oh yeah, er, well I've got this one big waterproof bag
Yeah
which is my old er, my canoe bag
yes
which they're dry bags for putting in canoes to put all, to keep your wet stuff 
aha 
er to keep everything, everything dry
yes
and er I thought I, I's gonna put our ski stuff, our ski er  etcetera in that on the roof
aha
cos they're, they're out the way
right, right
and er
just see how it goes when you get here then won't we?
I think on that, looking at it on a logical basis, er, I think our stuff will take up one third of the boot
Oh well they're should be no problem at all then 
er because I think if I, if I put one, my one big bag, which takes up about a third, er, er 
yeah 
and the boot bags on top
yes
I think it'll all fit in one side
oh that's brilliant, oh we should be alright then
I think we should have, I, I've borrowed, I've managed to borrow a set of change as well 
Oh have ya?
Oh that saves a bit of er worry doesn't it?
Yeah, so
So, have ya, have ya seen the snow conditions then?
No, er, I, apparently I saw on the Teletext last night
Yes
it was a hundred and twenty five in the valley and er, two hundred and fifty on top
that's right, it's, it's pretty good going anyway
yeah, I think it was still minus temperatures
that's super isn't it?
so it sounds as though it could be good
Yeah
it's not so good down the valley at 
no that's right, I've heard some bad er
cos, er, apparently there, there was fifteen centimetres
On top
that's right, it's very poor elsewhere 
on er,yeah
looks like we may have struck lucky, cross fingered and everything else
well I mean it is the most er reliable high resort
aha
er, which just as well we've been there before  
yeah, sure
so, er
did you, did you get Cath's letter by the way earlier?
yes
Good
er Jan's, Jan's 
Cath's just put a few things together and thought well I may as well let you, you know, she may as well let you know what the things she's put in
Right, well we're putting in er things, some tea bags, er sugar
Yeah
Cornflour
corn er cornflour
aha, that you always forget hmm 
er 
yeah 
some mixed herbs and er, and er, and cornflakes
Right, right, great
er we'll bring the pressure cooker with us
You're taking a pressure are ya?
Right
if, and we'll see how much space we've got when we get to your house
aye and then if it won't, it won't and
yeah
if it will fair enough 
er because pressure cookers do, I mean they're marvellous for going, getting the stew going in about er ten minutes flat  
aye, yes that's true 
er, I think er, I mean everything else is tied up, the green card's arrived the er
lovely
erm, the R A C Reflex is all sorted and paid 
that's great 
and paid for er and er, what I can remember the, the ferry gets in at, is it seven thirty in the morning?
It's something like that, I think it, yes, I think it's around about seven
Er, I've got er, I've almost abso three quarters promised to go and call on some friends in  on the way through
On the camp site.
on the camp site, in  somewhere east
So it'll be time for a cup of tea
so it'll be time for a cup of tea
alright, yeah
er
I mean that's no problem
I mean I've got er there's Vicky, Vicky  and her group from, from Morpeth
aha
er so 
so this is, that's all, that's down in the valley?
That's in the valley just er just 
That's right you told us, you said there was some people at
yeah and er
that's no problem
there's also my cousin going, er, and er, her husband
yes er 
and also a friend of mine who's what, and er, well best man to twenty five, well 
How many years ago?
twenty eight years ago now
Oh one or two  
yeah  


so
oh that'll be good 
there's a there's a whole gang down there
yes
er, so, we'll probably arrange  for, to meet up with them sometime, somewhere
yeah, oh yeah
erm, erm  but erm apart from that I think everything is er
I think we're all ship shape, so how lo how far is it on the other side?
Do you know exactly?
Ten hours
Well
ten hours you reckon?
well, well Vicky reckoned it was ten hours from Calais
Yeah and there's probably 
and I reckon I reckon we're, we're an hour short at Calais because er, we save about eighty kilometres
Yeah 
by going er Portsmouth 
aha
er, and er we also have a very short section on the  in Paris
yes yes 
which means, which again will save time I reckon
yeah, yeah
so, er, and I reckon probably the best, best way is to go, so, motorway as much as we can, down, well down to 
oh yes just, slam down the motorway absolutely
then head for Geneva
aha
and er we turn, it's about forty kilometres shorter to go via to Geneva via 
aha
and along the side of lake  to 
yeah 
is to go through 
aye
and er out to  
can be an absolute swine can't it?
Yeah that's right 
Traffic wise 
so, so I reckon, I mean even though it's Sunday I th I think we're better off going through er
yes
going that way
have you, have you got all the necessary maps then?
Yes
I don't need to worry about things like that 
no, no 
right
I've got the, this year's Michelin er 
oh that's great
er, big map
right, right, I'll just leave that it's 
ah 
just things I don't have to worry about then really
er, the, I mean I don't know what with, well, we'll see how things go when we're there, we're down there, I mean er, er if the snow's not so good towards the end of the week we'll, we just head back don't we?
Oh yes, yes 
Er and er
as simple that
I mean 
you can worry about that at the early end of the week
yeah  
 
I mean the one little thing that might be nice, it might be er, a romantic weekend, er a romantic day in Paris
Oh yes I'm on er well it's a holiday isn't I mean er 
a, a stroll down the  or something like that on the way back 
yeah that sounds very


yeah, you and I arm in arm Dick
yes  that's it, yeah   
 
well I wasn't quite thinking that actually 
and er what time do you reckon then, you'll need to pick us up?
Cos that, that was the main erm
I'll, I reckon that er we would leave here just before nine and 
right 
get to you som somewhere about er half nine, quarter to ten
aha
and aim to get away about ten o'clock
right
er, that way, I mean, I think it's giving us loads, extra time, but er 
yes 
I don't know what the roadworks are like on the A one
no I've no idea
er, I know that erm, they were bad when we went down at half term
yeah
er, and er
perhaps best to use the M one
and, we can always go and spend some time at er, we'll easy get a meal in Portsmouth anyway
yes
er, we felt the Pizza Hut's quite good in Portsmouth
aye, I think ya 
but 
I think ya mentioned that once before and I 
down s down 
I quite like Pizza Hut
but we haven't had, skied on those before
down in 
ah, that's the thing to worry about isn't it?
We can't really be out of er eye shot of the car is it?
No
That's the, the main problem
yeah 
we'll have to, we'll have to work it in shifts
yeah well 
yeah 




you must, bringing the take away out
yeah  
we'll have a take away in the car park 
oh we'll sort something out
oh yes
erm, so you reckon you'll get here about ten o'clock?
Well about quarter to ten I reckon
About quarter to ten
yeah
right
and, hopefully we can sort of aim to, to be in, in and away in a, quarter of an hour, twenty minutes or 
yeah 
unless it takes half an hour, well half an hour anyway
cos I mean how many hours driving will there be in this country, about eight?


Ee, I mean if everything went alright, it's about eight hours isn't it?
I would think if everything went right, it would be something like seven hours
Yeah
but er
the likelihood of that
er
I just don't know what it's gonna be like, er, so I think if we, well at ten o'clock, if we left at ten, we've got twelve hours to get down there
That's right, cos it'll be an hour, well to get there an hour before anyway won't we for the ferry?
I'd of thought so we have to be there, down there at eleven
yeah
er which we stop for  er we probably have a cup of tea a couple of times on the way down
that's right, yeah
er, so 
so I think that's about right Dick, I think you're probably right
yeah, so I think it's better to be on the safe side than er, than rush it 
well it is, yeah 
I mean once we're on the other side it doesn't really matter
no
er
it will be, it will be nice to get there sort of before it gets dark wouldn't it on the other side?
Yeah 
Oh yeah
I mean what I'd like to do to be, to be honest, I don't know if we will do is er be at er, at er Borg by about half four, five o'clock
yeah 
and up at the resort by half six
that's right
that's what 
that would be nice 
that's what I'd like
yeah
but whether, you, you never know in this world 
well that's right, but what, what happens with the er hour in France is it, is it 
It 
an hour lighter or, or an hour darker?
well it goes 
Goes on an hour
it goes, it goes on an hour
So it's an hour light, more light isn't it?
it's an hour more light, but with, but, but probably an hour further south
Yeah that's right 
so there so therefore even itself out
yeah true 
I think I think it gets dark earlier than it does up here for example 
Aha, aha yeah 
because of the er
yeah
er  it's something even, even though got, because it's about half an hour di is, is it, is it half an hour difference between here and London?
I can't, I can't, I honestly don't know
And I think it's probably at least another half an hour difference down there
yes
er, and with the hour's difference I think it works out about the same
yeah, that's right, there's nowt worse than being jiggered though is there when you get to your apartment
yeah
so with  I think that's inevitable though really
 
well er, and I thought we'd probably stop at er  on the way in, if we wanted to, to go and get any basic provisions at the, the big 
yeah 
the big hypermarket in the 
yes 
valley, cos that's cheaper
right
and er, cos Jan's
well again we'll, we'll see what the time is like won't we?
Yeah yeah, yeah 
Well wasn't the 
when Jan's er, it's Jan's birthday on Sunday as well which it 
Is it?
yeah  
Yeah my birthday
Well, if you'd only let us know we'd of


take an Easter egg with us  
Baked a cake 


Oh we've got, we've got the, we've got some Easter chocolates with us
Have you?
Have we?
I've got, I've just got one small box 
I don't think we have 
a token gesture
I got some truffles from er
Oh yeah 
 
er  the winners have this special deal at the moment
aha
 
these, these boxes of French chocolate truffles at ninety nine pence a piece
good Lord
erm
go and take them to France and sell them to the French  
they're  French ones as well, so actually er, I've got two boxes of them in the boot, in the boot of the car 
God
They're quite nice
They're very nice actually
Don't you've got me mouth watering


Yeah
mind you, I've, we've just finished eating our tea, we've been out to all hours doing the lawn, you know cutting the lawns all round the house
Oh yeah
this evening was lovely wasn't it?
yeah
Fabulous weather 
yes, we'll be leaving that behind I suppose
Aye apparently though, the, the weather's closing in though isn't it?
Er, er Sunday
Yeah
apparently the weather's getting worse
tt, apparently it's gonna be good over Europe, on, on Saturday
yes
er, so hope to, to be perfectly honest it would be rather nice if we had a, had a pleasant sunshine and drive across France wouldn't it?
Oh yeah, yeah that would be very nice,
Yeah 
just wait, just makes life so much easier doesn't it?
yeah
Visibility and
it should be reasonably quiet on a Sunday because most, because ninety nine percent of all er contracts goes Saturday to Saturday
Yes, yeah, why's er, I think we're doing it, it the right way, certainly, you know 
yeah 
we're getting there at the right time
yeah  but it can, it, it used to be absolutely horrendous at the Tyne Tees valley, well the, you were there for that  weren't you?
Oh yes


absolutely desperate, the number of, the number of hours you spend in a queue
What was it, what was it, eleven hours up, up the valley?
No, it couldn't of been 
Yeah used to be terrible didn't it?
Yeah 
twelve o'clock when we got there, half twelve when we got there
yes it was very, very late 
I mean I think we arrived at the bottom about six o'clock
oh 
yeah yeah we were just, we're just sort of moving a car length at a time weren't we?
yeah, but I think now, er that 
Didn't we watch two films on the video?
I mean the fact it's going up on 
 
up on a Sunday er we avoid all that and we, in actual fact if we go by  we don't even come into it till we get to 
aha, aha, yeah
I mean it's quite, it's very pleasant along the, the l the side of Lake  as well 
yes, and I, I don't know whether I've been that way, I honestly don't know  right then, so you're all systems go, that's the main thing 
Yes yes
Yes we're all, I think we're organized.
Okay, erm, we'll, we'll find out when we get there that we're not quite organized  we've forgotten 
No, we've forgotten the skis or something 
something
Er, well put the er the bottle opener in, that's the most important one
Yes, yes
hmm
the cork screw
yes


mind there should be one, there should be one in the apartment
yeah, they all, I always take one and I'm always pleasantly surprised usually by the amount of gear there are in these places
oh what I can make out we've got a bathroom and a bidet and er, er, it's
that's right the, the bigger apartments don't have, tend to be better equipped in fact don't 
yeah ah, I, it doesn't say whether we've got a dishwasher, I hope we have 
yes, that would be nice
don't, don't think it did
well
but it's er
I'm used to it, so 
there's fifty square metres which is quite a reasonable size for an apartment
aha, aha
I mean er, I mean, what, and the last time we went in, in, to tea in actual fact, we were in er a so-called four stroke five bedded apartment which was twenty two square metres
good Lord, yes
er which comfortable 
differently 
it was comfortable for two 
yes, sure
but this one, fifty square metres is, is twice the size of that  
yeah, yeah that's good
oh it, it sleeps six, so we should be er, we should have plenty of room
yeah, good


well if you have any further sort of info or anything else you need, you know getting ready, just give us a buzz tomorrow, tomorrow night
right, er I mean coffee, is bet to be honest instant coffee in France is a lot better than it is here
yeah Jan was saying wasn't she, how the 
yeah 
when you came through I think
yeah
that it's er better over there, that'll suit us
in fact we'll, we'll probably go and buy, buy some coffee to bring back anyway
yeah, yeah  smashing
I can't think of anything else
no I can't either, I've got all the tickets ready that's the  main 
that's the main thing yeah
yeah that's right, I've just got to get me currency tomorrow and then
yeah passports 
I've got I've got the currency and you're sort the way we're sorting it out is that we pay a quarter and you pay a half
yeah that's right 
on the apartment 
well I've, I've got me er, hmm me Visa, I'm hoping
yeah
that'll be the thing
yeah
well it, you usually can anyway in France can't you?
you normally can, yeah 
Use it, so 
well I've got me Eurocheques
lovely, and we'll sort out all the rest
yeah
all the rest of the finances as we go and work it out
yeah, I'll just er, I'll make erm, I'll, I'll start with a full tank of petrol from 
yeah, yeah 
and, and then if we sort of 
aha 
work on the basis of er, we fill up just before we drop you off on the way back
well that's right, I mean if, if you, if you've already paid for things like Reflex and erm green card and stuff like that, if you want I'll, I'll just put all the petrol on erm me Visa
well we'll see, erm
that's it, I mean something like that, you know, we'll work something 
well what we'll do is we'll, we'll work a book
yes
ah
that's very wise yes 
and then er we just er 
have a kitty for the food
we just have, and we'll have a kitty for the food
yes
I got my pur I've got my kitty purse with me
ha, ha
so, if I don't, I, what, what I don't
I thought you were taking your cat with you then when you said a, we'll take a kitty






yeah
no the last we did it was er, we just had a, had this, had this purse with the, which we, we stuck a couple of hundred francs in each to start of with 
yes I think that's the best thing 
and when, and when that er was extinguished we
yeah
we put in another hundred francs apiece
yeah, yeah
and this, we, we just worked our way through it during the week
yes
er for all the, the baguettes and er
yeah
whatever
oh yeah
and
that's the best thing to do
and er then er, and then I kept a book for, for the petrol
yeah
er and the road tolls we just  jotted it all down
yeah
so that at the end of the time we just say right so an so, we split it down the middle
yes, good
cos I think if, it gets, it gets awkward if er  you do it piece 
oh yes, yes, oh yeah you wanna keep everything er
yes
just so
yes 
that's right okay then
rightio then
unless I hear from you tomorrow night for any reason, we'll see you at nine forty fiveish, on Saturday 
on erm Saturday

That sun cream, no
