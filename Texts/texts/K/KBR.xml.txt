With that, let's have a go
 

Want a cup of tea?
I suppose you've been whistling today
No 
Well we'll have to do upstairs, hoover that much longer
Why's that then?
Oh cos when I've been doing it
has been up there nattering, it's been noticed, so Norren come up to me today and she said oh er you don't have to do upstairs she said, give it a couple of weeks she said and you won't have to do it any more

yeah  so I said oh I see, so that was that, so I think they've got a, a meeting in a couple of weeks and they'll sort of tell her discreetly that she has to carry on and do it what she's been the
time sort of thing you know, so, said it's been noticed that like
and all that you know?
Yeah

it's got to be scrubbed more often so you know
