Well er  they've got erm  a hundred places I think.
I think it's a hundred places, and there are about a thousand something sa 
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
students went 
Oh!
and erm  eight hundred have been turned downed already, they've didn't get an interview so the chap said well your  to get an interview it's good.
Yeah.
But most of them you see, are at a county standard  in in in er erm  oh  like in 
Competition like.
yeah, it's like in er erm
Yes, it's competition Margaret.
But Claire said they kept coming up to her and saying what are you erm  what do you stand as being county for?
And things like this  you see !
And when has she done this ?
That's what Derek told her.
Well Derek's been telling her for ages you see, to to  join the 
Yeah.
into level to erm
And she's gone into the second years, you go there when 
Yeah.
you got competition.
Well she's an old  said she's a bit old to be doing this, because you know, I suppose
She's not?
Well no.
I don't think that should bother her.
a bit old because erm
Oh God!
I dunno, something about
Oh I thought that was mine.
No it's not.
It is yours isn't it?
No.
It's a .
Ooh !
Well  I suddenly, that's what I thought, thought that.
I would have thought it 
Yes.
had done well.
I thought with all this .
Oh!
Wha 
Erm 
what a shame!
So she's a bit disappointed, course she is!
Well sh she's a bit down.
And then she's got the one from Charnd, you know, being rejected again.
Oh I'm so sorry!
Of course there is such competition
Yeah.
involved now.
And I said it's, that's what Derek said because there aren't any jobs around you see 
Yeah!
they're all going to college.
Shh!
Shh!.
I know.
Shame tha , it's not this one.
Oh yeah.
She erm
Ooh I'm so sorry!
She said, what a waste of time!
She said they're absolutely  absolutely useless!
Is that what he said?
But you said that she'd got the interview Margaret
Yeah.
is that right?
Yeah.
Bu bu , but I mean  but they're not expecting to have it on a plate!
Think of the positive .
Don't they Margaret?
He thinks , and said well no
Well no.
so, he said that she's feeling a bit down in the dumps and quite moody.
Well, you see the  you say they are  but that doesn't mean anything.
I mean 
No.
it could be, I mean i if she's  if she's interested in it.
Well apparently she said  stands her in good stead because
They, they left here  erm  about half past eight, twenty to nine and they got to about  half way they hadn't been gone twenty minutes and I thought, oh she's left her photographs, she had to get four passport photographs  and she'd left them here and I thought we'd send them, send them to her  and she didn't like them you see, but she'd have them.
So I phoned Derek on the  car phone  and erm  he says oh we'll get some taken elsewhere.
So when they left Bristol they went to  find a place that takes,, then they took the wrong turning off the
Sto , the mo the motorway.
the motorway !
And then, her interview was one o'clock she didn't go in till quarter to three!
Oh!
And Derek was sat waiting all that time, but they must have panicked then so  they erm  we'll have to wait and see.
Oh Margaret!
Keep our fingers crossed for the poor kid!
I'll think we'll have to wait and see.
Keep our fingers crossed for her.
How's your bathroom going?
Well that just .
Oh dear!
Ah erm
Well no, it's sa it's not been to too bad really but  erm, today there are children there and that front door was open.
Oh!
And that's the first time 
Oh!
it's happened.
They're not very clean workers.
Aren't they?
No.
No.
Oh!
But still, erm  and of course you miss and ta erm  gotta keep on running up the stairs 
Yeah!
you know.
But I I, I mean really and truly I'm moaning a bit but I, it's not quite so bad being near there.
What's it looking like?
But do you know what it is?
What?
the, the far wall.
I see.
What's wrong then?
Do you know, I said that, you see, I said be careful!
Said Angie did that didn't I?
Well we, really must get one, one today  .
Well why didn't he put something in
Well I didn't know.
You not being .
Pierced it!
Absolutely pierced it was.
What do the tiles
Mm?
what do the tiles look like?
Oh not bad!
But I'm 
Oh!
not having an arch, I thought about it and I thought  I don't think it'll  in here.
No.
And I thought, if he's a bit apprehensive then I'm not having it done.
So I'm have it  straight across and I've had a border put across there just to make 
Yeah.
a bit of a feature of it.
Yeah.
And once again he didn't  put it as low as I wanted.
Oh.
And then, well I wanted it one tile lower, but I thought  he bloody would have done it !
Mm.
But I looked at it and I thought well  I'm being silly here because, it's not keeping that for me,, you see he's given me a bit of  and
Mm.
because if he  put the bath right in there, I would be standing up at the end of the bath 
Yeah.
really, rather than anything else.
I mean, I must  a , be able to stand up.
And so, you can't really get under the canape  put up your shower, this is what I wanted, I wanted it to look like a  cubicle
Oh I see.
right?
Yeah.
But, can't do that, and I thought well  it doesn't really matter.
But, you see, you could see the extractor fan, so I said to him look, I asked you, he said, oh I thought you sa , I said, no, I said to you  I don't like seeing that extractor fan you 
Mm.
see.
Mm.
Well I said,back there I'll move it across.
Mm.
So he's moved it
Mm.
so that you can't see the fan there.
Yeah.
I said, well as long as you can do that I shall stick with the other.
Mm.
I said, in fact, I think it might look better.
Mm.
You see, I wanted it on the level with the windowsill
Mm.
I mean, I mean .
But erm  erm, I'll  just there.
Yeah, I remember you don't.
No.
And it's half the problem
Well I suppose it's  the way you wanted.
No!
You see I, I feel a bit disa , look at that building that that's
And you see is Margaret, when Gerry used to do it I could change my mind half way 
Yeah.
through.
You see, if that didn't go, I'd say Gerry try it there, not don't do that, try it.
Well you can't  do that, and he'd do this like that!
I know!
Yeah.
I really
Well that's your weakest area 
But Gerry didn't have confidence you see so he used to  sort of rely on me  to tell, but you will come to the conclusion that if I had would have said Gerry's workmanship was absolutely superb!
And he used to sort of be embarrassed about it.
Well of course it's superb, he was a perfectionist!
He was, it was superb!
I mean, I feel a bit, and he used to sort of denigrate it.
Yeah.
You see, he didn't have the confidence 
Which is worse isn't it?
Yeah.
I mean he
But when I went in, Gerry's workmanship, when I think of those cupboards he put in for me
Mm.
in   South Penaton 
Mm.
they were absolutely brilliant!
And the kitchen and bathroom he did for me in  Teddington  and !
Yeah, cos that that was Gerry's trouble wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yes.
He was too much of a 
Yeah.
perfectionist, that was his trouble.
But he, he used to sort of say, oh don't tell people, you know, he'd think .
Mm.
But it was absolutely superb!
And his tiling, Gerry's tiling
Mm.
and he's tiled all that kitchen!
Is there?
Yeah!
Yeah.
And it was absolutely wonderful!
Yeah.
But mind, it took a long time.
Yeah.
Which is why he was   
Yeah.
But, no, I wished I had, I wish he'd come back and I, and he could see how  good, how 
Mm.
really good!
And that patio, do you know there's nothing wrong with it!
Absolutely everything was level and everything.
You won't get one shaped like that today.
Well , you see  I'm gradually learning this 
Mm.
Margaret, you see, cos Gerry used to behave as if , his was sub-standard and a professional 
Mm.
would be proud of it.
Mhm.
I come, I realise now that Gerry's
Mm.
was perfect, just about perfect.
Mm.
But erm
But he worried too much about this.
Yes!
You see, and you see, I used to say but Gerry as long as it's  up to your usual  and it looks alright .
Yeah.
But you see,.
But anyway, I've come to the conclusion that he, I mean, his work is, it was absolutely superb, but I mustn't expect that.
But having said that, he's doing it quite nicely and so I mean, I'm not denigrating.
No.
I mean that plastering on that inside of that cupboard is perfect!
Who did it?
He he did?
No , no the other.
Oh the other one plastered it?
What the builder?
No.
The plumber.
Oh did he?
It is  like silk!
Oh!
He's good then?
Oh he's good.
Yet, he has .
But he, he's put some shelves in and I don't need those shelves.
You know, in the airing cupboard, stacks
Yeah.
he's put me in two rows like that 
Yeah.
and they're, the cupboard is far back enough for me to be able to get to the top, even though there's only a doorway there 
Oh!
Good!
and they, they're gonna put my light in there
Oh good!
That's good!
I'm gonna get my light in there.
Oh!
So then, be able to see.
And, he's gonna put me another  er  shelf, another thing actually I'm going to put hooks on.
Mm.
But I'm very, very pleased with that cupboard!
I should keep some  off the floor, I think it should be in  
Yeah.
And also, you don't get dust and dirt, if they're on the floor it seems to gather on the floor 
Yeah.
but if you hang them up I think it's better.
Yeah.
Well it looks better.
But I think you can, you can get them all in the cupboard now 
Yeah.
Well if you 
You get th 
have a good tidy you are aren't you?
Yeah.
Then you'll be able to put your ironing board in there.
Yeah!
And then 
And my , and my erm, and my erm  er clothes horse.
Just gonna get my  
, yeah it's ever so big!
Oh that's good then isn't it?
I'll be able to put all my  in.
I'll be able to put my   and the iron in.
Are you?
Mm?
Oh!
I'm hoping to anyway.
This poor shelf gets worse and worse !
I know!
I'll get myself a new one.
Is that the one of mine you borrowed to do the  
Yeah.
I'll get myself, I know it's past it, but it it does, it does!
She said to me how long ago did you have this?
And er, donkey's years!
Donkey's years!
isn't it?
Mm!
But er, when I got ti all tidied up and sorted out I'll get myself a new one, but er  
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah you must come.
How did you go on at the fox hunt today?
Oh yeah!
But it's a mess!
I dunno 
Well I would say
well yo , they
What are they doing all for
No!
No.
Oh well the children are on holiday.
Oh is that what it is?
Yeah.
They're on half term.
Well maybe isn't it?
Yeah.
Well I remember at erm  a i i 
Wendy  she used to be full time, I mean the shop .
Mm.
To give out  a lecture on fighting and .
So the other girls were there and we were meaning to talk and erm  when we went to cash up everybody was interfering and bother, I don't know, got 
Mm.
on my nerves, you know!
Mm.
And er, it took us a little time to do that but  and it was alright, but, well, but she bought us doughnut in company.
Oh!
So she ne , never even brought us a doughnut!
Oh!
It was just dreadful!
That shop .
Oh, that's supposed to be a good shop!
Ooh!
Do you know that's  doughnut then is one of these chewiest  most uninteresting doughnut, I mean, I've ever eaten!
Cos they queue in our bread shop.
Well!
I, I was surprised
They're queuing there.
Absolutely amazed!
That is now, I don't think it does so well.
Cos Betty's used to be in Kwicksave.
Yeah.
And they used to do very well in there.
And then when they went over to the other side of the road which  I don't walk on very often 
No!
erm  I don't think they do so well.
No.
And in, Claire always says there's th , there's a la , dogs sniff around the back of there all the time 
Mm.
by the, you know the cheese shop that used up above 
Oh God, yeah!
she said there's always dog in with the cleaners!
Shouldn't like that!
So she says, she always says to me don't buy erm 
No.
things in that 
Mm,
in that shop.
Mm.
But I was, very disappointed tonight but I hope it, pay too much notice cos they're quite expensive aren't they?
Yeah.
Have you ever been there actually.
Ah!
No.
No, so don't like her doughnut, I mean, this was a horrible 
No.
one!
Oh I don't anyway.
I looked in the Help the Aged this afterno , it's closed again you know!
tt!
Ah is it?
When I've got  some more time I'm going to offer my services again.
Well it was shut on er  Thursday, Saturday till four o'clock and nobody was in there and that was half past two!
I expect, you see, see they can't get the staff.
and I think they come 
Yeah.
to help out.
Well anyway, I I'll definitely go up for half a day a week  you know.
Well I don't think, I, they didn't have much in the window, I couldn't see very much cos there wasn't a light on.
It's nice and clean in there!
Mm.
Right, you were going to tell me about Jean now.
Yes the  er  builder's broken her bath
Have they?
he dropped a tile in there.
That's exactly what Andrew did.
Mm.
But he's managed to get another one.
What, another bath?
Mm.
To go round the er, to to match, I suppose it's the same, I don't know.
She says she's fed up with having them there.
So they had to take the bath completely out 
Yeah.
again.
It's been ti , it's been tiled as well.
Mm.
That's exactly what Andrew did.
Mm.
That's how fragile they are.
Dropped a tile and it pierced it right the way through.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well it must have been pretty thin to do that anyway.
Well she said it was same bath didn't she?
Anyway
She wanted me to go and have a look at it with that still in there.
And then she's going home today.
I went to these people today
Mm.
absolutely over the moon  with this job!
Tha they are just absolutely delighted!
Did Julian do it well yesterday?
Yeah!
It looks lovely!
Does it look nice?
Mm.
And erm  he practically cleared everything out off the property
Mm.
so when I got there it was just a case of clearing up.
Andrew, can't, can't, can't go 
Can't go back till he's finished.
there until eleven
Oh well you'd better tell him then.
Well I'll phone Andrew this 
Mm.
evening.
He's got i , a dental appointment.
Oh!
Well isn't the lady there?
Well  they don't really know Andrew do they?
So 
No.
I don't think they wanna leave him in the house on his own.
Oh I see.
Oh he's started this other job
Oh he's started it?
Well, he he  he works like the clappers he does!
He was there when I got there  and erm
the er  the gravel, the chap delivered the gravel
Mm.
and er  when he got there Je , er er erm, Julian and I were loading about a ton of turf into my van  and I was gonna take it to  Caffer Cliss but  he said  for fifteen quid I'll take that, I'll take that away for you.
So I said to, and Julian said well he says it's not worth us doing if he, and I said yeah well, fifteen quid that was cheap!
It filled his his truck up  so he said when he comes back on the next delivery  he'll take all the turf away for fifteen quid.
Mm mm!
So we  that meant, say, that I instead of me being away from the property for about two and a half hours, taking the turf back  Caffer Cliss we saved all that time.
Oh!
And where was he gonna take it then?
Well I'm not interested where he takes it!
No.
Anyway, when he, when he came back again  we had to come back cos see we had another delivery of gravel  and we ordered three yards and we reckon that  on the last journey we bought two yards, we've got over a yard too much gravel!
That's almost enough to do our garden path.
Oh!
Which is a nuisance really because we gotta move it now!
Yeah!
What do you mean for the er  place?
Mm.
Oh.
We had er
What do you call it?
Erm
we had two people today  who rushed out on the main road.
One lady thought we were turfing  and she said could we turf the lawn for her?
And we said, yes.
Gave her the leaflet.
And the , and then another person asked, so what I did I put my leaflets on the wall
Mm.
and we're right on the main road and I reckon about  two hundred people walked past the garden today  watching us.
Not taking the leaflets?
Julian said a couple of people took the leaflets.
Oh.
Cos he he really does it, I don't know how he does it really, how he gets it all level like that.
I mean, it's a big area we're doing.
I did all the er  all the labouring, bringing in the cement  mixing 
Mm.
it up ready and he, he made the slabs.
Oh!
It says 
And 
here that Sassafras has been  named potentially unsafe for consumption.
So, don't put any in your mouth.
Saxa what?
 Saxa frall that's a plant!
I know it's a plant!
Why is it un he erm
He's heard 
I thought you told me Claire that you were delivering a project today.
Tomorrow.
Oh!
What  what's it for?
What?
Sa sa 
It just says it's un , unsafe 
Yeah , but what do you grow in there 
But what do you take it for?
don't have everybody eating  Saxafrazz I thought that was a flowering plant!
What do you take it for?
It says  these herbs do turn up in some food supplement.
Oh!
And it says her, dyslexia  dyslexic people have different sized brains from normal people.
That's why you got such a big head!
What bigger or smaller?
Erm  they have a slightly enlarged left hemisphere  that's associated with pinky.
Oh!
Oh!
Your library fine was twenty P  and yours was twenty P.
I've put your eighty P out there.
Twenty pence!
Mm.
Couldn't you count?
Why??
It should have been  twenty  forty, six, eighty pence.
Twenty P she said.
Who's did she look at first?
Dad's?
Yeah, well 
Mm.
she obviously took them both for the same thing didn't she?
Well I don't know.
She just, twenty P 
 
for both of them!
God!
I said, but they're not mine they're my husband's and my daughter's.
So what work have they got on today then?
Anything happen yesterday when you weren't there?
No.
Well, we were going up to, we were going up to Bristol so we put the car phone in the  took the car phone with us, right?
We got about  twenty minutes away from the house and the phone starts ringing
Just going past  Cheltam Marshall weren't we?
Yeah , the phone 
That was me.
No.
So 
Yes it was, it was me 
It was mum.
No way , it was, it was a house 
trying to check up 
call apart from 
Oh.
that
By the phone.
and this chap said erm  he said, I'm sorry to trouble you we've sent you an invitation to come to this building thing and I sa 
I thought it was a funeral thing!
fu 
Funeral!
Roofing!
Oh I thought you said a funeral 
It's a roofing , one thing or other.
And erm  Claire spoke to him first of all, and we decided to pull over  and talk to this chap  cos he was going on and on, and I said to her
Can you make it?
I know it's short notice.
Are yo , are you sure?
Yeah I'm sha , sorry to trouble you, and, we were going on and on and on about it!
You come to this seminar or something or other.
And I said erm  are you sure you've got the right number?
I said.
I haven't been invited to a seminar.
He said well you're  something roofing aren't you?
I said, no we're not.
I said what number did you dial?
And he said  .
Oh!
Yours is seven isn't it?
Yeah.
And then we got about another  half an hour and we had another call.
And that was Mr Ju somebody.
Mr   wanting to know where his piece of wood is.
Oh!
I might try and do that, I'll do it tomorrow.
Haven't you got it yet?
No!
Well that's not very good is it?
You said you'd have it to him on Tuesday!
It's Friday tomorrow!
I don't call that very punctual 
Yes I know, but I 
service!
I know that but I'm only doing this as a favour, and I've gotta really go out of my way to get this piece of wood.
There's no profit in it Claire.
There's no money in it for me.
And if there's no money in it for me  I'm not gonna give priority to going picking up a piece of wood for a customer.
That's not a very Christian attitude.
Get off!
 
 
Oh I'm sorry!
But it's not is it?
No, but dad's not Christian so that's okay then innit?
No, but I'm not, I'm not in business to run around picking up pieces of wood 
Yeah but you should have said you were gonna do it should you?
And he's not even a customer!
You shouldn't have said you were gonna do it if you don't do it.
Yes, but I did it for him fo , I I've already done it for him once, I picked up exactly what he wanted, I delivered it to him  and now he's changed his mind and  but I'm not in the business to supply things, I'm not a supp shop!
Is that bloke with the fence?
Mm.
Oh is that who it
But I will pick it up for him tomorrow.
Anyway, Aunty Jean's quite pleased with her bathroom, she says it looks a lot bigger.
Yeah it does look bigger.
 
And she said the cupboard's good.
What time's she coming round tomorrow?
And do you know what she did?
She went down  Wednesday she had to go late because the builder doesn't come very early so she didn't go to  to B and Q until  the afternoon, and she was going around, or Do-it-all, one of them, she was going around  looking around and then  as soon as she looked out it was half past five !
She's on her bike!
Oh!
God!
She got no light on her bike!
She didn't ride back did she?
So she had to ride back on the  she rode back on the 
Oh!
On the cycle path.
she said there are loads of them on the cycle path without lights on!
Oh yeah, you don't bother with lights on the cycle path.
I said, well don't do that again!
That's really dangerous!
She said I was having a lovely time looking all round these things!
And she bought things with her erm  twenty five pound voucher   said I was having a lovely time and I forgot the time!
Well it's like  it's like Julian, I gotta keep on at him to stop working  because, he wants to go early anyway, but he he
What time did he go tonight then 
Yeah.

I said ,, no  I said, what time do you wanna, are you gonna go today?
He said well I've gotta leave at five today.
So I said, well, we'll have to start packing up at half past four because we got cement mixer to clean and all the 
Yeah.

He still hadn't finished at quarter to five.
Where was he going then?
Why did he want go to finish 
He had to go and pick somebody up.
Oh.

No I haven't got the freezer done yet?
Why haven't you got freezer done?

No.
philosophy do you?
No.
Gotta be a certain level, O sev , A 
So you're all starting at the same 
level standard.

Pineapple?
Yes alright, yeah.
and goes on a course where everybody starts 
Yes,
at the same time and that's it.

Amanda said I've got to sto , she's not to stop going to night school.
I said, well you co , if Claire wants to stop nothing'll make us go will it?
I don't know.
When we went to that the interview yesterday it was ever so funny because  we're all sat in a row and this girl next door to me was from Cornwall, and this other girl said, where are you from?
And she says, from Cornwall.
She said, do you know Sarah so and so?
She didn't!

And we went
Yeah.
How big does she think Cornwall 
Well she might , she might be a county standard athlete

No brain!
How big does she think
Actually, I thought
It's like on Delboy last night,i he he said er  he's he's in hospital with a nurse watching him all day and the thick one at the bar, did you see it?
The thick one at the bar said  cor!
Fancy having someone staring at you all day!
Erm  what was I gonna say?
I thought  she's just the type of person which everybody would avoid to speak to, this girl!
You know, the one that gets on your nerves!
Not very nice!
Well
Well she was!
Not worth beating around the bush is there?
Well are there single rooms there or
Yeah!

Yes it is.
Well you can stay on with your boyfriend if you want to!

They share the same rooms do they?
Yeah, they got the me , men and women in the same
Course they have pools with a girl!
Yeah, but I mean what 
At !
yeah, but why do you think, what do you think the reason for that is then?
Well
No,we why do you think, what we er we er, if if you said  if you were looking round a place an , and and a mother said, I'm surprised that you haven't segregated the men from the women in the dorm.
Well they'd get in there anyway!
No but wha , why, what do you think
I don't know why!
well she said because it's good security for the, for the girls.
Oh!
Because  this 
Well some of them are  aren't they?
No, no!
It's this, er the campus is very exposed to 
They get down and then 
people walking in 
Yeah.
and 
because it's an open college and erm 
you know how nurses
Look what happened at erm
you know what nurses' accommodation 
the camp 
is always had weirdos
look at the erm 
looking into windows and whatnot!
accommodation at Manda's, they had a  chap go in there a rape one of the girls in there didn't they?
They'll be weirdos looking into windows there and they'll looking a big beefy rugby player!
Well that's Paul at Cambridge had erm, a girl on the same floor as him.

showers.
and the rooms 
Really?

In the paper the other day they had 
Well they must see wo , men and women in the same
stu students at Oxford University were  parading, were demonstrating that 
Mm!

Gonna have a bit more of that.
men excluded from  wo , some part or other because it was causing so many problems.
Oh!

Oh don't let me finish dad, you know!

I don't think I'd like to share a bathroom 
No, I was surprised but

Did you have to spend it by a certain time or 
I've still got five pounds left.
I 
Oh!

You better get a move on!
Yeah I know.
Well I thought well I'll, just think about what I want with the last five pounds.
Mm.
So I bought  a tin, a five litre of  white silk emulsion, brilliant white emulsion, erm  a two litre  drum, a thing of white spirit  a pack of  erm  wool, steel wool, cos I'm taking off the varnish off the doors, they're coming up quite nicely!
So how's it all going?
Mm mm.
Erm yes,job and I thought if I get steel wool

Mm.
quicker.
Erm  get that there.
And what else did I get?
Ooh!
Battery for radio, it's just gone, cos they

And  two plugs  thirteen amp 
Aha.
ah ah  a tin o , er a thing of Superglue, I've always wanted some Superglue.

And you're gonna come out and find yourself stuck to the wall!
So I, I bought some Superglue.
I'm not gonna use it really, I just want some
Imagine !

And erm
You'll be going round glueing everything  now !
Yeah.
Ooh!
And a tin of, ah,o a a small tin of erm   of brilliant white gloss cos I want to do the gates outside, you know that fence outside.
Erm  and I'm having that delivered.
So I'm having the steel wool, the emulsion, the, I thought cheeky monkey!
Even though 
Yeah.

to deliver it for me!
I come on the bike and I can't have it.
Mm.
Mm!
Er, so the steel wo , well that's  
Mm.
that's only gone for me.
I'm having that delivered but the little items I bought myself.
Mm.
And then I thought, now what am I gonna get for my five pounds?
I thought  course it'll be, by this time it's getting dark!
Mm.
I didn't go until  why didn't I go?
You wasn't there?
Now what happened?
I was a bit annoyed actually cos I even had to wait for him 
Mm mm.
in the mornings!
And I can't think what it was.
I don't think he  he had to go out or something happened, and I thought, oh blow this for being 
Ah oh!
with cowboys!
Anyway, I had an early lunch and I went out, but of course I'd forgotten
Yeah.
it gets dark!
It's dark.
And I looked out and I was having a lovely little wander round 
 
and I thought  oh God!
And I was like a young  by the time I got home.
Haven't got lights on your bike!
Oh well that's alright ended up on the cycle path, you know.
But I thought blimey!
But I knew, it makes me laugh because when Joe used to go to these do-it-yourself places I used to say, oh come on Joey!
I'm as bad as he is now!
I'm looking at the  all the tools, I thought  ooh that sander's quite nice!
I thought, fifty five pounds, oh that's too dear I'll 
Ha!
do it by hand.
And I was looking at the drills, and
then I was looking at all the garden stuff, and  and I thought well, start by the, and I thought I'm doing a Joey!
Yeah !
Looking at all the paints I'm 
I bet 
gonna get !
And I thought, oh poor Joey I wish he was back 
 
he could wander rou , if only Joey had let me do more
Yeah.
He didn't let you do enough did 
No.
he?
No.
I could be really interested!
Yeah.
I find I'm interested in it 
Yeah.
Marg.
Yeah, but he wanted you for slave work!
Yes!
Didn't he?
You see how anything could 
Yeah.
and as for painting, he would no more let me touch a painting brush!
No.
And,a all these things I thought were so difficult!
Blimey Marg!
Mm!
I mean, painting the ceilings
Mm.
And I,an and quite honestly you don't, I thought ooh that's gonna drip everywhere!
I doesn't!
No.
The 
Yes.
one I got, what else did I get?
Ooh no, I was gonna get some of that erm  Ronseal stuff, not the creosote
Mm.
and I thought oh the creosote's good!
Mm.
I'll get that creosote .
Mm.
Have you done your shelf?
No, not time.
I haven't had time.
No.
No.
No.
And you see, when men move out there Marg, I find out
Oh it's difficult!
it's difficult
No I don't like to people in the house yo you don't know what to do do you?
Whe 
No.
wherever you are, I mean today when I was trying to get ready to go  wherever I was there were ladders there, or there was 
Yeah.
this there, or they were there
Yeah.
and  I try to keep out of the way.
Well you should come round here, I told you.
Well I know, it's
You should have come round here, I mean 
And we've still got to collect all the 
Yeah.
stuff up Marg.
Yeah.
But I might, I haven't bothered about the food so much, I thought  cos once I mean I used to go behind the, and I thought  I'm having my sa lunch time and I'm going to enjoy it and I am not going to sit in corners!
Yeah.
So I either have it in the kitchen or I go  and I say to them  do you want a cup of tea?
I'm going to have my lunch now.
Yeah.
And I thought, blow it!
I'm 
Yeah.
not gonna  hide and 
Yeah.
juggle my lunch!
Well I don't think they expect you to anyway.
Course they don't.
It's in 
Yeah.
you.
Yeah.
It is.
I don't like it when er  cos I've got the boiler man coming on Tuesday
And
to take that out.
Yeah.
And he won't be here five minutes.
No.
I don't, you know, you can't call your house your own.
No.
But you see once I get this over Marg, the worst'll be over.
Mm.
I've had everything done.
Now when it's done 
You got your en suite to do.
Ah, yeah!
But that'll mostly be outside.
Yeah.
The only thing I'll have 
Yeah.
them in for that is when they cut the door open.
When they put that in.
Yeah.
Now that's the only time I shall have that.
How many years , it's only three isn't it before you have to have  planning 
Yeah.
permission again.
Oh!
I can build a  I've only been there, I haven't been there three years.
Oh no.
Two is it?
Coming up to two.
Two.
Anyway, as I say, you must be careful because it will run out.
Yeah.
But I definitely going, if it's re , if erm, I want Derek to have a look at it, see 
Mm.
what he thinks 
Mm.
about it
Mm.
and if he thinks the work's alright 
Yeah.
then I'll 
Yeah.
erm  get him to do 
Yeah.
that if the price is, price is right.
Yeah.
Do think it will be alright if he did this or not?
I think it would don't you?
And I think if we go and have something in  down by the sea and see what we've got there I think it'll be alright.
Er, probably Paul's had it for the night.
Did i , did you 
Yes.
did he say he show you any work that he's done or anything?
Who?
Mr ?
Yeah, he did say you could see  some of it 
No.
you know, I mean it 
No.
wouldn't er
No.
You see, but he didn't have a Federation of Buil , Master Builders, but whether, I mean this chap must have quite a few, he didn't say it, but 
No.
er
Mm.
he's a bit, they're a bit lucky with their erm 
Yeah.
Mind ,
You see th 
builders are cos I mean 
Are they?
at times I I, er, yeah they're awful!
Oh!
But the front I mean
Yeah.
you know I like to keep my front 
Yeah.
the muck that, I just don't look.
Yeah.
But it's muck and the wood they leave there, the tools they leave at night!
What when they go home?
And all the wood!
And I think  Oh!
I I can't bear to look at it 
Yeah.
I just  co close my eyes at it 
Yeah.
you know.
And before they come in the mornings I  tidy up, I, well after they've gone at night 
Mm.
too, but  I make sure that the hall's dusted and 
Mm.
it's all sort of swept 
Mm.
nicely, and then in two minutes flat
Mm.
it's
Yeah.
well I know they can't help that 
No.
but  I still think they could be, I mean, he doesn't sort of strip out the bathroom every time or anything like that.
Sweep into a corner or something 
No.
like this, you know.
No, yeah.
But, mind, Mr  isn't.
No.
Mr  would 
Derek said, and he's there on his own?
Yeah.
And he said the, the electrician's good.
What  co er 
He didn't used to leave any mess.
No.
No mess!
No.
And Paul   whatever he did, it was all tidied up.
Yeah.
See tha ,i if this chap's got a fault, it's that he's a bit of mucky worker.
Mm mm.
Mm.
But lots of  er, builders are I think.
Yeah.
Derek always clears up when he goes 
Yeah.
and when he, he doesn't leave it untidy, he cleans.
But then, you see, I think to myself sometimes, oh you're being too fussy!
You see, now nothing works again with Joey  Joey never ever left any muck.
I say, if it was midnight Joey went round with that, I didn't even have to.
No.
Joe went round with that hoover and it was all clean 
Yeah.
and tidy.
Perfectly 
Mm.
left!
Yeah.
See I've been spoilt really 
Yeah.
Marg.
You won't get that with workmen 
No.
I can say!
Been spoilt.
No you're right.
I realise this see,sh 
No.
I'm basing it all on past experience.
Yeah.
You see when we had those men in Chesham and Joey he did his nut when we 
Oh yeah.
went up to our bedroom while we're having an en suite done and the plumber had left all, all along ply boards.
 
He nearly went mad!
Yeah.
Yeah but Joey was over the top if anything wasn't he?
Yeah I know that.
That's the trouble.
I know.
Yeah.
He was over the top with some of it.
So er
But the trouble is he's got me into the way of thinking 
Yeah.
you know.
Yeah.
See Derek's not that fussy.
Mm.
Joey was.
He would  he was i , he always is and I know that.
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
I know that.
Yeah.
But once you've seen it, you know, and er 
Mm.
but having said he, having said all this though Marg I know I'm going to be pleased with it.
Yeah.
I know I am.
Yeah.
What time do they work till?
Half past five.
Oh do they?
Oh!
He'd gone when I got home  from Texas, about quarter to six and they'd gone !
Well you were on your bike!
I hadn't reali 
Oh mind, it was quite light, it wasn't  and I saddled on the path and I didn't, I don't take chances.
But, it wasn't really dark.
Yeah, that's right.
Policeman come up to you.
Well they were screaming, and I thought you stupid !
But it's a funny thing how many cyclists go up along that path 
Yeah, oh yeah without 
without lights!
Oh yeah!
But it wasn't all that dark.
No.
Well it wasn't dark.
Expect lots of them do, but 
Yeah.
erm  if you had to go on the road it would have been different.
Well I wouldn't go on the road, that's all.
No , erm
There I am laughing to myself, I thought you stu , and I was lost, you know!
Ooh then I went to the B and Q to see if I could get a blind to match, but  I spent , so I 
Yeah.
I'll have to go into Poole
Mm.
and take my leaflets out 
Mm.
with me  and see if I can something 
Mm.
that'll match.
I don't 
Yeah.
want to spoil it now.
No.
No.
Must not 
No.
spoil it.
I don't know where there's a  where is there erm
Oh there's two or three!
Are there?
There's erm  well that shop on the left hand, right hand side as you go down, they sell curtains and they're a bit thin 
Oh yeah!
but they've got 
Yeah.
come quite nice ones in there.
Oh have they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Only I've got to erm  Ashley Road, I mean, I can go 
Yeah.
into all those places 
Yeah.
in Ashley Road, I'll get something.
Yeah.
But I'm not going to spoil it, I want to get something which will, ooh!

And smirking rather a lot.
Yes, but pretends he's not watching and he looks over the top of his paper.
And grins!
Oh it's stupid!
I mean if anybody else just got up on the stage like he does  and kicks his leg, kick like their leg like er like that they'd boo him off!
It's quite funny though  when he kicks his legs and he went  he goes  ooh wah!
What's funny about it?
Well that's funny!
You're not expecting him to do that.
Well you didn't think it was funny when we went to see

A 
young people!
Amanda laughed at them didn't 
Oh!

She did, well, there was a quite a few funny bits in it.
And when they were doing that male  modele thing, when, when they were going  and God is nowhere!
What did he do that wig on his head for?
Cos he was judge, whatever his name is.
Judge who?
Pickles?

And we'll go out and pick up aunty Jean about twenty to eight.
in your own world .
Oh I don't know if it'll be very good, but it , what's it called?
Sex and
No sex or something?
I don't think dad'll like it, I don't know why he's going.
Seen him  
Well you didn't like the last one we went to did you?
That's probably because I'm being stared at by some bloody bla ginger haired git in the back row!
Stand by me ee ee

It's probably because I was getting looked at by erm  a ginger haired boy
Git in the back row!

No.
A yellow and a pink one up in the same plant.

just waiting for aunty Jean.
I'll see you later then.
Alright then.

I'll give you a ring.
So don't be too late

Ooh, I'll give you a ring if I'm gonna  be in for tea.
You'll give me a ring if you're gonna be in for tea?
Yeah.
Yep.
Oh I'm alright I suppose.
Yeah?
How's Pam, alright?
Fed up?
Yeah, fed up.
Can't blame her really can you?
No.
No.
It's a bit annoying.
I think they should have tried to the bathroom myself.
Yeah, but they 
Should have done 
they're gonna  stop soon now they've got a house.
Are they?
Yeah.
Then they do the bathroom  and toilet they'll
I didn't know why they haven't done it before.
Why have they 
Well it's it's, it's difficult.
Why is it difficult?
Cos it's money involved.
Well it takes all th , no it's all tied in with the plumbing you see, it's there  and everything.
Yeah, well I think they could have done it a bit quicker don't you?
I think they could have done.
I think er, and Pam says there's a sort of post sticking up in the ceiling or something?
Yeah, well she doesn't really understand it.
I think Derek says he's sa , it's a, it's a erm  tt, temporary thing.
But she says she's made a 
Ah that's right.
hole in this, this the, they've put it in 
Yeah, but it's all gonna be inside it, it's gonna be boxed in.
Well she said she don't want it going up the middle there.
There ain't much choice really!
Why not?
Well because the drains run right underneath the house there you see.
The drains run right  under the house.
But did she know that before?
Yeah.
It's on 
Well 
the plans to that to go on 
Oh right.
the inside.
Oh!
You'd think they'd  like that.
It's not gonna be right in the middle of the bathroom or anything like that, it's more 
No.
for show.
Oh.
Well I think, I would have thought they could have done it a bit quicker, the bathroom, if they wanted to.
And it's a bit difficult for her isn't it?
Especially 
Yeah.
with your mother.
Yeah that's right.
It's a bit difficult I think.
Oh it is difficult.
Yeah.
Anyway, that should, should have the bathroom in operation.
Are they gonna do it?
Yeah.
Are they, what are they going to have today, plasterers?
No.
No, Monday they're coming aren't they?
Yeah.
They were supposed to be here last week.
And they got the order of .
But they, they couldn't have 
I was 
done anything cos, you know, it weren't ready.
Oh!
Weren't ready.
Well they're a bit over the, their stated time aren't they?
Stipulated
Yes.
I don't, er well 
You won't have to pay them anything soon,cos you wo you keep knocking it off you won't have to pay anybody will you ?
I know.
Yeah, I mean that's  six blokes there working there and they're falling over theirselves really, in that
Yeah.
Too 
space.
many.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well then Pam made me laugh cos the tiler he, she said he's go up on the  roof  and he's there for hours !
Mm.
Sort of, and then once he comes down he's hardly done anything has he?
No.
Just sits up there
He's made a good job of it though.
Has he?
Yeah.
You can see it from the bottom of our garden 
Yeah.
you know, you can see your  new roof coming out .
Yeah he's made, he's made a very good job 
Has he?
of it!
Oh!
That's alright then.
Yeah.
Suppose it's a bit, I should think  I think last night she was absolutely fed up Pam was!
Yeah she was.
Take it out on me!
I said no good you moaning at me 
 
er I can't do anything about it!
No, but you're just  you're handy  aren't you ?
Yeah that's right!
She's gotta have a go at something hasn't she?
Yeah!
Yeah.
I gotta have all of it!
There's no, oh the buck stops here and I can't  pass it any further !
Yeah.
I  but don't forget she's got your mother as well and I think you can't 
Yes I know.
you can't be normal can you really 
No.
when erm
No.
erm I couldn't have looked after my mum.
I mean, I did it for four months and then I couldn't do any more, I just think  I mean, I know Amanda and Claire were a lot younger then and I think it's difficult when they are  they're younger.
But I mean, she's a dear old soul but I haven't got her round me all the time.
And I think i it's her not being able to hear you as well, it's awful isn't it?
That's hard work innit?
It is hard work isn't it?
Yeah that's right.
And Cla , Claire was laughing at me yesterday, she said, you don't have to shout at her!
I said, well if I don't talk loudly she doesn't hear what you're saying.
I don't know whether it's deafness or whether it doesn't register that's what I mean, you see.
I sometimes go, wurgh urgh urgh urgh!
And she says what?
And then I say it properly and she's got it then you see?
Has she?
Yeah.
Yes.
She  I think you can see on her face though sometimes John, that she hasn't understood 
Yeah.
what you've said.
Yeah that's right.
It sort of registers on her face.
But then I think if you get one side of her she hears you better.
Maybe, yeah well perhaps we've gotta get a hearing aid or something.
I dunno.
But she says that she's  years ago she used to put an onion in her ear or something.
When she's
Yeah, that's right.
Cos she reckoned that cured it.
She hasn't still  got it in her ear has she?
Hasn't got it  
No , you know whe , when she put an onion, you know when yo , the centre, core of it
Yeah.
and she used to 
She says it's stuck.
plug it in like an earphone.
Yeah.
Oh what's that supposed 
clears the catarrh.
Does it?
Yeah.
Truly?
Or is just a 
I'm sure it works, I'm pretty sure that works.
Are you?
Yeah.
Oh.
But she said I, sort of, she said puts, puts something in here ear it
You know sometimes when you you, you put your 
Your pop the , yeah, you can 
Yeah.
pop your ears can't you?
Oh!
Oh well.
Anyway, you've had a week off.
Yeah, that's right.
Resting.
Rest?
I haven't rested!
What did you 
I haven't had a chance to rest!
what did you do then?
You got your greenhouse Pam said.
Yes.
Where you gonna put it?
Down the bottom of the garden.
It's down where the rest of  goes down int it?
Yeah, I dunno what to do with that.
Plants , not , I keep calling it .
I might use some of that polythene, that thick polythene  sheet that Derek gave me and do that round the bottom sheet.
I said to him, they got enough junk up there now and you have to go and 
I'll could use that.
add to it!
I reckon I'll cut that up perhaps and
Yeah.
And put the bottom actually 
It came from erm 
it's gonna fit.
a flat
It's plastic.
Yeah, they had erm  a balcony and er, so then they didn't want it there any more so he took it off.
Oh!
And I said, well they've got enough stuff up there!
Amanda says oh well John wanted it!
And I reckon I'll, I reckon I can use that instead of glass.
And won't he hit his head hard if he gets into it.
No.
Well it won't crack 
But it's stuck in 
it will it?
Yeah but it's stuck in .
Yeah, but they have all sorts of ideas don't they?
Nobody else knows about it yet.
Because I think  I would have thought he'd stop doing that now, but Pam said he still runs down the bottom of the garden.
Yes, he's quicker than he thinks.
He, he's got   now, he just cuts from  and he's  just missed the tree.
Said he wobbles  doesn't he?
Oh yes!
Yeah, he catches himself on all sorts of things.
Do you think he'll be any better?
Tha than he is now?
Maybe.
Yeah 
But 
I think he gets a little better.
Cos he wobbles doesn't he?
And he sort of I dunno he si when he picks his paw up sometimes  it's all  erm, limp isn't it?
Oh yes!
Where he can't 
Yeah.
Will he get any feeling back in those do you think?
Oh no.
But he int too bad .
No, I didn't think he'd get that better.
I thought you'd have to have him put down.
I didn't honestly think he'd get any better.
Especially when I first saw him sort of, crawling on his tummy and  not wanting any food and  I thought, ah!
I don't think he's gonna get any better.
He surprised me actually.
He's a real character dog 
Yeah.
thought isn't he?
Yeah.
He's a 
Really surprised me!
I dunno, I've never had a dog with such character as that one.
Because  I didn't think he'd have the erm  what's the word I want?
To get up and go again, I think he sort of, I thought he was just gonna lay there.
No, he's tough!
Yeah.
Yeah, but he's, he's, he can't keep doing that can he?
No.
Well not once he gets older.
Cos I mean if he keeps rushing down there and you got the greenhouse there he's gonna go through that!
Well he don't go right down 
You can't go through  !
he don't go right down.
He don't rush that way.
He won't be er , but she was so  she said you're gonna chop the tree down, that tree whe , that he bumped  into !
But I think he won't do that again.
Will he?
Well he will go into something else.
You know, he he could do.
He's excitable isn't he?
He's sort of 
He's determined.
Yeah.
Nothing matters, only where he's going.
He walks 
Yeah.
if there's a cat, he goes straight through the bushes and he'll go straight through!
That's what I mean, you see.
It's a bit like a boxer dog because  Derek's sis sister had a boxer dog and he used to  we used to walk along country lanes and then he'd pi , he used to see something he used to go straight through the hedge!
No one 's 
That's right.
in the way!
Oh Bramble .
and all sorts!
Yeah , that's right.
Yeah!
I thought stupid animal!
Yeah, this one's just the same, yeah.
Yeah.
Daft!
Oh he'll get hold of a hedgehog and shake it and with that he'll come out with prickles all on the end 
Oh!
of his nose!
He'll have all fleas all over him!
You know, but  he does, I can tell you, he does anything!
Yeah.
Da , have you seen the fox in your garden?
Oh!
All over the place.
They 
They 
stink the place out!
they, yeah we've got one, we've  one going through our garden, he's limping now I don't know what's wrong with him.
He's so got something wrong with his back paws or something like that.
In the day time?
Yeah!
He sits down here and he sunbathes!
On the bottom down there.
He walks through there and he gets up on that shed at the bottom of the garden  next door but one.
Does he?
Yeah.
Gets up on the, on the  shed.
Yeah!
I don't like him in the garden, but Derek keeps encouraging this thing.
I said if our cat gets out all over the 
Put all the , all the scraps out.
That's what he keeps doing for them.
I don't want him to do it!
So if he does it again, he's had it!
dogs as well.
Yeah!
That's what he does.
And yo you see our cat's always roaming around now, I said he'll get that stuck on his ears that  rats has.
I don't want him having that on.
Fox ?
Yeah!
Do cats get it?
Dunno.
Most of our garden'll be finished one day!
Gonna concrete that all round is he?
Yeah, he was gonna have a path all the way round.
And he's terracing the garden .
Dunno where, mind, but it erm, and he's gotta finished painting outside yet.
And  then he's terracing the gar ,th sh , he's gonna bring the shed out, because it's rotten, it's behind that hedge you see.
Mm.
But I don't know if I want it brought out.
I don't particularly look at the shed but there you are.
But you leave it there it rots.
It was my mum's shed actually, he bought it down after she died.
That's his mum's  picnic table, we got all  dead people's stuff !
That's his mother's  plastic table she bought just before she died.
Looking at all the, at the stuff but the trouble is you've gotta find somewhere to put it all haven't you?
And our garden's not very big.
And it's alright for, your garden's bare!
Got so much rubbish, it's not true!
What did you do?
I put it, put it aside cos I will use it one day.
That's what Derek says.
You see we got th er collects things down here he keeps chucking rubb , he said well I need it.
I said, but when?
Oh!
Oh!
I'll need it!
We did actually, cos he used to for all going down there.
But I suppose it'll get finished one day.
I don't know how you manages your garden.
Too big!
Isn't it?
Don't worry about this, I think, you don't have to worry about it.
Yeah, but men don't, but wo wo women at home looking out the window they do don't they?
I've gotta re-lay all the grass now cos we run out of 
Oh yeah.
I've got that tree stump down.
Yes.
Pam said you did that.
That was good wasn't it?
Mm.
Oh it were your mam, I think your mam told me that you'd got it out.
I bet that's made it a bit lighter hasn't it, with that tree gone?
Oh yes!
Next door especially.
More light.
Well you got one of their trees in there and they'll cut that down and they don't do anything about them.
The sun goes behind there.
I don't know the pe , people's name next door.
What here?
Yeah.
Erm
I thought you were definitely gonna 
Thought you said you were in a rush this morning?
I thought you were definitely gonna show me  up today and say, how the hell am I supposed to get into the garage?
Yeah.
I didn't realise you'd taken it.
I haven't forgotten to go  shopping up.
That's why.
Yeah.
If I'd have got my clothes on to get 
Yeah, but I thought perhaps you wanted to get into the freezer 
No.

Yeah.
Little snotty nosed kids running around everywhere!
Pardon?
Have they got anybody to look in there?
Yeah, people are wondering into the property
Oh!

If they're wandering in and out.
No, I think they're gonna have to be a bit careful.
Mm!
But I asked them to photograph those documents  which we found and they don't want to do it, so that's up to them.
Oh well,isn't it?

no, not really
only if your a professional biker
does, does Steven know there's a new cycling magazine out?
I don't know dad
a racing cyclist
Steven and I do not converse, we just
 
so what's happened in work today Clare, there must be something happen love
not really, quite boring actually 
perhaps he don't want you in now maybe business is bad 
it don't feel like Friday today probably cos I've had a day off 
no its weird in it?
 
I've opened some 'em
yeah, I've seen it  I must get my bike back together dad I might 
yeah 
go and buy some wheels tomorrow
yeah, cos you've got the money there
oh I thought you were buying a new one with that money
I've got enough money to make together, er, yeah 
yeah, but she's got enough money for two bikes 
oh has she?
yeah
oh  are you gonna put different bits, bits on 'em 
I know, I know what I would do Clare actually, I would buy another second hand mountain bike
would you?
cos I don't think your gonna be, your gonna be satisfied with having a  you know the er, if you get a dropped handled bar bike you, you won't like it, I'm telling you
mm, perhaps I ought to have a go at Nicks 
and there not all so heavy as, as that I can tell you that 
no 
I tell you what, if you get one of the earlier mountain bikes there made of five three one tubing which is lighter than what you've got, there's loads of them in the paper for sale and there so cheap
yeah, they are cheap 
and what you can do is to keep that one for best
yeah, but its not best is it really, the frame's so heavy you can hardly ride it  I don't know whether its worth 
well the alternative is to, to put it in the paper and advertise it to sell it, say the, the wheels have been stolen 
mm, any body who picks up that frame dad on its own, is gonna think bloody hell that's 
no 
heavy
no they won't because
well I would
at the college Margaret where Clare went to the other day they had a notice saying about bicycle theft's from the college
did they?
yeah
what's it say?
I wished I'd of stayed a bit longer now and had another look around
why I, I wanted to go around with you, but  I wanted you, what I was thinking of when I was sat in the car that you, when you come back you could take me round when you've been round
mm
and a lot of people take the front wheel off the bicycle and take the front wheel into college with them
yeah 
I would of liked to of looked around actually
yeah I was such in a 
and I thought 
haste to get away I think
I thought I saw some students go across the road, they went out of the main entrance and walked 
that's the university that is
where's that then?
down the hill
well why did they go down there then?
well perhaps they applied to university as well 
or perhaps the sports grounds down there
its the university hall  she didn't say any thing about using the university facilities 
why they must do because I saw some of the groups of them going 
no 
or if they were going to the university they wouldn't of gone there for the interview
no, what I'm say is they might of had an interview for the university as well 
no I don't think they did 
what's erm interviewees or students already there?
no, people coming for 
oh 
interviews were taken on tours and I saw some of them go down the hill
oh
oh
I suppose it depends on the, on the
it was ever such a big erm accommodation camp, because we went behind the college down the hill
I know and there's another 
Queen Hill and there's this first, second and third year old 
where the club is where the social club was, yeah
yeah, where the social club, where you went in that building
mm, mm 
yeah 
and actually there's another entrance down there because cars were coming in there
yeah they were coming in there and we nearly got knock got knocked over about five times  actually there was another student car park at the back as well 
the students are allowed to park their cars outside their rooms
are they?
mm
that's good in it?
and I saw two or three
rising tyres and park and jump out and go into their rooms
oh so they have cars then some students
not very, I didn't think there was very many cars there, most of them were beat up cars weren't they?, like mini's and things 
I reckon this is is this spi , is this a spicy?
what she mean beat up cars?, yeah I think it said spicy yeah, is it nice?
mm, nice and hot yeah
mm  How longs the book the erm, a waiting list now for Mrs  
four weeks
oh about four weeks oh 
I got her there, she said she was in a hurry because she was afraid to leave Keith too long  I said well I'm in a hurry as well so I got her there as quick as I could and erm
don't she leave her mother then?
mm?
doesn't she leave her mother?
she doesn't like, well he had erm a bit of an attack last night, palpitations
oh did he?
and that's dangerous for him because 
mm 
of, he's got a severe heart condition
how did her husband die did you say?
he spent erm, two years in the services I think dur during the war, two or three years and  went through a bit of action and then, I think she said he was a policeman when he came out he, he joined the police force and he was cycling home one day and erm, I don't know, he fell off the bicycle, hit his head and he died
ooh
thirty five 
so her sons then not 
and then she married, she
her sons not the name of her then
she married again and her second husband died
what when he was young as well?
no it was some years before she re-married again 
oh 
she said she wish'd had gotten re-married earlier than when she did, so I'm not quite sure how long it was
oh 
and er  I said to her do you miss London?, and she said well she does for the theatre and that because they were only a short tube ride away from the West from the West End theatre's and she said there's more on in Poole here than there is in Bournemouth in terms of plays and 
mm 
theatre, in which there is
mm 
erm
does she  and that 
and I, I showed her around some I, on the way back I said I'll take you to Branston Park on the way back and I'll show you where John's working and I took her on to the, into the car park and I said look there he is up, huh, cutting the lawn, he was up cutting that, the big lawn  she said one massive place  I mean I took her all the way through Branston Park back to erm 
she said do you wanna come in  and look at the kitchen now and I said no I won't stop now I'll work
bring it up with my
yes  I'll have a biscuit I said 
that's quite good erm magazine that
I'm gonna have a look at that
its quite interesting
tonight

no thank you 
what do you want a Hob Nob?
I said I'll work something out for you and erm I'll be in touch with you next week

food, food
yeah but its all altered because she's altered the
 
ah, will there be more
down there?
yeah
oh 
now she's changed her mind, the trouble is when you go and look at all these lovely kitchens 
yeah see, soon change don't ya?
you change your mind don't ya?
yeah 
I think she would of liked it er if her son was with her, she would really of liked him to be with her so that, cos she said he, he owns half the house
mm, mm
they've got it in joint names
mm 
she said that wished she'd er, he'd been able to come, I think, I don't, I think she worries about him too much, too much
well he could of done if he'd of taken her in the car would , couldn't she?
well I don't think he would of done, he's too shy
oh is he?
mm
thank you Clare, erm 
myself, I think that if any thing happens to Keith  which is obviously he's not gonna live a long life  if any thing happens to him I, I myself I reckon she'll go back to London, because she's got absolutely nothing here  she's got a cousin  although, I don't think she'd move in, in with her cousin
has she got relatives in London?
yeah
oh
her bo , not very many there, because her mother had her very late in life
oh
like your mother
oh
and erm, her brother is eighty one, her, her brother
mm
and er, she said he's a bit a  she said he's suffering from Alzheimer's disease
mm
and half way through a composition he can't remember who he's talking to and things like that
mm
so how erm, but he's eighty seven he is, her brother
no he's eighty one
no he's eighty seven I've just remembered it, he's eight seven  erm  I reckon she'll go back to London myself 
well why did she come and live down here in the first place?
well she came down for Keith's sake, she came down to Bournemouth for holidays and erm  like it so much she brought the company.
oh 
Julian was telling me that erm  he's house on a Friday night is like a mad house because his daughter does a bit of hair dressing on the side, and she's having people come to have their hair done
oh, she's got her own flat
no she comes to Julian's house cos
oh
to have her hair done, she brings her boy friend with her and, another neighbour always drops in to have a chat with his wife on a Friday evening, she stops about an hour, then his son brings his girl friend, so he said its like a mad house
mm 
I think his back was aching a bit actually
was it?
yeah
does he get a back problem?
well no but I mean its, it was er really hard work
he'll regret he ever met you
laying a hundred and thirty slabs  mixing up four tonnes of cement, pretty hard work
well you helped him didn't you?
yeah I know, but its still very hard work, and I'm ten years older than he is  I, I just did as much as I could for him really, I mean  I did more mixing than he did, I did nearly all the mixing

Clare stop sniffing

and also you want proof of ownership 
go and get a tissue

cos it could be nicked
nicked and stolen
Saracen is what we looked at in Horsfall 
Saracen were those yellow one's weren't they?
no they were orangey red
yeah and there was yellow one's cos there, there was a lot

don't be daft , he's about sixty five
oh there's loads of veteran runners of that age running around still
yeah and dropping dead
I think it, oh is he as old as that? he was, well 
no, he's, he's a bit older than that, I should know.
he said something about when I was fifty three I did this or something 
oh 
like that  he's a neu neurology, neurologist
yeah
yeah
mm 
I don't want a   A reg Citron two C V, eight fifty or near offer , god there going cheap aren't they?
mm
nobody wants them
I shall keep it for a bit longer Clare
yeah, its just in the wet weather its a pain
yeah it goes in the dry weather doesn't it straight away?
yeah starts straight away 
mm 
its a shame 
does, yeah 
that there's wet weather most of the year
yeah
isn't it really?
and did I tell you I bumped into Jean  when I went down
yeah, I tell you what
she's on her way to erm, she showed me her tiles in the bathroom there quite pretty, erm, she erm  isn't very pleased with the way the tiling's been done
no
and she had they were 
why, I did notice something else, but I thought its not, I'm not saying any thing to Jean though 
they were er a what she wants you to look at it and see 
cos its not fair, but I noticed that  they'd put plywood at the back of the bath
mm
where the shower fittings were coming through
mm
and in my opinion they should of clad the plywood with plasterboard before they put the tiles on 
oh I don't know
and I bet you they haven't
any way she said its nothing like the tiles she had done in the kitchen
no
so she, she, if it weren't, if she has him to build her own suite, she's gonna get erm Lee, what was his name Clare?
Lee
dad cos he did a really good job  to do the, the tiling and you see she had seconds tiles
well
from Pilkingtons and there's little, she said you wouldn't notice it but there's little like, little things on and when he did the grouting yesterday she said that she said it was awful, she didn't like it at all so she told him this morning
what she didn't, what she didn't like the tiles or she didn't like the grout 
no didn't like how he grouted it because she said there, things like a little nick in the tile, if he'd gone in with the grouting it wouldn't of shown any and he didn't
yeah, but why should he have to bother to go and nick in seconds tiles 
I don't know 
she shouldn't of dam well bought seconds tiles should she?well I mean if you buy  what do you expect?
and she said she, its cos she said, she said of course if its because she's so used to Joe he would of, I said yeah but he went over the top didn't he, cos he always did every thing to perfection, I said you can't have Joe doing it 
fancy let  to go in and mix with the grouting, its a bit of a cheek in it?
well he got the tiles she didn't
yeah, but she selected them and she got 
yeah, but she they didn't get the one's that, she couldn't get the one's that she wanted cos they didn't have enough 
no, but if you'll buy if you buy seconds tiles Margaret then you have to 
well he went with her 
yeah, well that's not his bus that's her fault isn't it you'd buy seconds 
she said Joe would of got them all at the top where you couldn't see them and things like that, I said well you won't get builders doing that 
no of course you won't I'd er, I mean why should a buil 
haven't got time to do that 
why should a builder, because she's bought second tiles, take time to sort out the duff one's 
I said to her you'll just looking for fault all the time you are I said that's 
yeah 
what your doing, your just, she said I know I am  she says I'm nick picking, I'm just looking for faults, I told you that today
that's why you wouldn't  when we do things sometimes, we won't fiddle about er, erm with poody things its just not worth it
no  but she said it look's much bigger, she's got a very big broom cupboard
Cor their naff death, young death's in here tonight
who's died then?
twenty four, seventeen
what they die off?
tragic death both tragic death's
well that's those 
well that's that car crash

in it awful seventeen years 
mm 
and then your gone
fast moving road I think that is
ah 
that frog's
still on top of the pond
when its got air in it, it won't sink
no, but I thought perhaps it was frozen so it won't fertilize 
yeah, but it , what do you mean its already fertilized
yeah, but I thought the frost would of killed the, the 
well it might 
its gonna stay there until it rots
no I thought the frost would of killed of the
well I don't know if, if the eggs can withstand frost 
its too cold, there dead now 
now, I'm not sure 
that's what I mean there dead aren't they
yeah 
cos it the frost it was like a lump of ice the other day
I know, but
you might as well throw it away
yeah I think you might as well throw it 
go and  
yeah, but there's a big lump underneath the water as well 
they haven't been
since its too cold
no
at a time they had, they had a lot from
yes, is there really?
 
I, I don't think warm, so why they early?
well they do it is, they get a bit of sun on the water don't forget that water's not very deep 
yeah 
especially 
no 
the shallow end, any way I'm gonna clear off now, clear up
what time we going out?
well I said we'd pick up aunty Jean at twenty too eight 
I want to sit down before I go a rush this morning
I have to put the tape on
oh yeah, you'll be slapped
mm
that's cos I said to him round the other way
turn round the other way she said and ran straight back this way 
.
I was talking to Mrs  the other day, down the road, she's had, she had er back problem and she gets terrible trouble at night, sleeping
I saw her daughter about half past seven taking that yappy thing out 
did you?
yeah
it yaps a lot that do don't it?
she was walking up the lane like this
erm, John was talking about his erm
his son
his son today and he said he didn't pay his insurance, his car insurance up, I said well he's working in he?, he said yeah I said what 
he hasn't got a job has he?
yeah he is working he's a computer 
oh where's he?
specialist or something or, or training to do, and I says well what, what do you pay his car insurance for then if his working?, oh well he doesn't earn enough 
why's he got a car then?
and I thought well why's he gotta car for then?, and what's happening his father's doing the car, spent about
dad, your hard
a year
your a hard father
I'm not, if you want a car you, you blasted run it, I didn't have a car when I was young
I didn't have a bicycle
Anyway, I'll I'll put in the note anyway, because that's the, thank you  because I, I feel I've got to get a few prices to find out 
Yes.
what the sort 
Yeah.
sort of erm, the market's like.
But no, I've made up my mind now, I'm going to get it all done.
I'm going to gradually 
Yeah.
I I've, finished 
Get the work, yeah.
now and 
Well you've done very well, I think.
And 
I mean that kitchen was a major job 
Oh!
weren't it?
All done now.
That kitchen was  yes!
But didn't it go on for such a long time!
Yeah.
But mind, I will say this about this chappie  he does stick to it.
I mean, he's 
Oh.
gonna stick there today  and I 
Well to work at the weekend as well 
Yes!
he must be  maybe he's looking out for more work, I admire 
Yes!
people like that.
And, not only that, he's got one of his men in with him!
You see he's got, bought a chappie in with him.
So  I I  I've said to Margaret, he's a, I think he must doing something with the extractor fan because he's cut a hole in the er  barge pole so, on the board so obviously 
Up there.
doing something up there.
Well I said to Derek, look at our tiles, you see, and he said that's unfair because he said these aren't, what?
They they never 
Your tiles are
these, these, your tiles are the same as ours in the bathroom  have got slight raise on the edge 
Yes , they have.
But then you don't do that.
to make a good square so you 
Ah!
have to big spaces in these 
Mm.
that's why there's a lot of 
Mm.
grouting.
So you don't do that
Even with a big old bathroom.
Yeah.
But mind, since you 
No , not down here.
Ah!
Upstairs.
Upstairs.
Ah!
But since you've, since you've said it's not too bad, I looked at it again, I thought, no, perhaps it's not too bad.
No it's not.
I think I was being over-critical.
I think you weren't .
Yes, well, I wanted to fill in those bits though.
Oh!
Ah!
But I think perhaps I'm
And in some places 
I'm inclined to yeah 
it was , it was 
Yeah.
quite
But, if I ever have it done again I'm going to buy those brass things, and, it only costs about five pounds more.
Whereabouts did you get them?
I've seen them with the tiles .
I don't think , I don't think you had them with those tiles
Well we did them 
when 
in the kitchen!
Yes!
You had it, I  with the  
 
Yeah.
Yeah, but maybe he done it cos you space there, see.
Well, that's it.
Well  do you know the tiny little   
Didn't he?
No.
So there's that, all that  
Cos half of  tiles don't need spacing.
Oh!
You sure it hasn't got two blips along the se , one rung at a time.
No, I don't think it has.
No I don't think it has.
But it's ,i I saw him down at , what he did  he moved the bottom   which 
Yeah.
gives him his level  then you put the stuff on the wall then you .
Amazing isn't it?
But it's marvellous to see a good expert at 
Yeah.
work!
No spaces.
No.
So th , no spaces in them?
No!
Exactly the same as yours.
Er,th , a lot of the modern tiles don't have spaces.
So you'll be doing it 
 
by eye?
No, you don't need to do it by eye.
Once you put the bottom run in and that's 
Oh I see!
Oh pardon me!
I'm thinking that's the bottom run.
I'm with you!
That means 
Once it gets coated, once everything is level 
That's 
on one run 
I see what you mean.
It's got to be
Yeah.
So that you don't 
 
you don't really need
No.
to leave spaces 
used to leave spaces !
Yeah.
I tell you, I would leave spaces 
Yeah  
I'd have one slightly out and 
Yeah.
and .
And, you could imagine what Joey would have 
Yeah!
done.
 
You'd see a 
Just like, like that he was.
Oh!
Ha!
Well I should imagine my  would be insulted now when I gave him all those things !
Well perhaps he didn't use them.
Well no, it's a lot of the modern tiles don't have spaces.
Yes, but he'd be in .
Anyway , I've gotta go look!
Alright.
Derek's 
Erm 
gotta go.
What time are you gonna pick me 
I've gotta pick up 
today?
I've gotta pick up this grout at  don't wait for me 
Can Jean look round up there?
Yeah.
Don't wait for me for lunch.
Margaret!
Don't wait for you for lunch?
Because, I I shall be back probably about, and just  I mo , I'm, I've got the car phone in the car as well.
Oh allright.
 
Oh alright then.
Do you know it was ju , I've been scrubbing, and scrubbing, and scrubbing my hands!
And look at my nails Marg!
I cannot 
Yeah.
get over the dirt!
Well I should wait till it's  actually Jean, I don't think there's any, it's only that bit anyway, to be honest with you.
Yes.
No, I I I can remember what it's like actually.
I 
Yeah.
I couldn't , I think what I do now, when I, I don't look at anything and suddenly  almost ready to  have something done myself.
Erm 
I think that 
I've found looking at it
I don't think that's right if you go there.
You don't think so?
No.
I think I'll go round looking now 
Have a look what every  has got.
Yes I will.
I will.
I'll go round looking and see 
So which would you prefer?
Well the  fine.
Fine?
Mm.
You've got them crossed now haven't you?
I think I have, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yes!
I've got them crossed.
Got them crossed.
You've got a good eye Margaret!
Yeah.
Got them crossed.
I'd forgotten that!
Mm.
Well 
I wonder if that would be better?
Well I don't know, I think that's quite nice across.
But I 
 
think probably it's because it needs painting cos it's a horrible colour isn't it?
Oh yes!
What is it?
Er er  
 
A creamy colour isn't it?
I'm painting that with white.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have all white.
Are you?
And if I want any col , I'm going have towel hanging 
It's not at all.
I'm going to have towel hanging where the cedarwood is now.
Yeah.
And if I want any colour I'm going to get some black taps in the bath.
And I'm gonna paint that er 
Yeah.
seat black.
Yeah.
So get the dark, very dark 
Yeah.
black.
I was fuming when I came home!
And she's gonna get it when she comes home!
Well I ca came home, I had Derek's overalls in the  the sink, they need washing on their own, and I said to Cla , so I had to go shopping this morning because  Claire only worked all day yesterday so she 
Oh yeah.
couldn't take me so I 
Mm, yeah.
can't do it.
Mm.
Because it hurts my back.
And erm  I said to her, dad's overall's in the machine so when they're finished you hand them on the line.
Yes, okay, she said yeah.
Now  in here Jean was her washing bowl full of washing soap in and her bits and pieces like tights and that.
Now, if you take something out of the machine in th , what would you do with that there?
Well  dry it.
It was just left!
Oh no!
I can't do it now!
So she's gonna get it when she comes in!
Oh that's naughty Marg!
And all you've gotta do is put 
Is just put it in!
Yeah.
So put some  
 
Yes, put some soap powder in.
Yeah.
That's naughty!
See  machine has gone off.
That really is naughty.
I mostly do now is hers.
Yeah.
But I was really mad!
They just don't think!
I was shattered today when I came home!
They just don't think do they?
And then Derek home and Manda said he was shopping, and I said  oh come on!
I said, it takes hours going shopping with you!
He said oh!
He said, we're not in a rush.
I said, mind they don't eat .
That's what we were saying  used to say  we do.
Well I'm afraid I'm a bit like Derek, I take my time.
Oh!
Oh I love it!
Go shopping, go and come back!
Oh I love it!
I, I, I love poking, but it's so funny what you see, now if I hadn't been poking, know that little bonsai tree?
Mm.
Now if I hadn't been poking around that shop and in an 
Mm mm.
I would never have seen that  
Yeah , but that's different to food shopping.
I hate food shopping!
Ooh no!
They've got, do  do you know when I go into Sainsburys, mind you, sometimes I go into Sainsburys and I don't really want anything, I just like to look round in there.
I bet you buy something though?
No!
I don't 
Don't you ?
No.
No.
If I don't want anything I, I just go in there and I think  well I'll just go and see I may see something which catches my eye.
And I go in there and I have lov , I can be in there an hour!
Just wandering around 
We do our  in an hour!
I know, I've seen you.
We'd be in there three minutes!
And that's too long!
Ooh no!
Yes but you don't see what they've got!
in an hour, they must think you're weird!
No they don't.
Well, well what do you do?
I just look  , I just look at the shelves and  I look to see what they've got and 
 
look around.
But  they look
Yes, I, if you don't  see what they've got.
You might be missing something.
Well I don't think anybody's see how much the
Oh I know  
erm
I really love to!
I mean 
And, and it's surprising what I've found when I've bought erm
Yes, but when you, you have to shop  for us lot it can, and loads and loads and loads 
Ooh!
it gets a bit 
I used to shop in Sainsburys .
I mean 
Oh!
it's exactly the same thing.
I used to look, I used to look for bargains .
Yeah, but you've always liked shopping anyway.
Oh yes!
I love poking around Marg.
I really do like shopping for 
Joey used to say to me
Yeah.
don't go shopping with Jean!
I it's a, sort of entertainment for me!
I'm just gonna see how much the sultanas were at Tesco  
they're fifty five in Quicksave.
Is that how much?
I have to buy that.
It's a whole week, mind we don't go out and erm  when I came home  just, the last evening, you know, after the play 
Mm.
I enjoyed it really Marg!
But I know it was a bit hot!
It was too hot!
Yes it was too hot.
But I enjoyed it!
Mind you, I thought it was nice.
Yeah.
I enjoyed it.
Oh yeah, seventy five, they've gone up.
Ooh!
They're fifty, only fifty something 
Yeah.
You
I'll buy some in Quicksave.
Yeah.
They've got  sulta , they've got raisins, fifty five!
I only buy sultanas.
Mm?
I only buy sultanas.
Well they go sultanas in there.
Well raisins wouldn't hurt you.
They're lovely!
Yeah I have bought raisins, but normally they're, but they're not expensive are they?
Well no!
No!
They're only fifty five!
Oh!
I'll change.
But they aren't the  they aren't the  Californian ones where they're sort of big, fat and juicy 
Yeah.
and sticky.
These are, but they've still got the flavour of raisins 
Oh.
mind.
I'm, I don't like currants 
It's funny int it?
much, I think they're something and nothing, currants.
Yeah.
I got some currants that are left over 
Have you?
from Christmas and 
Yeah.
I don't usa , I mean, I can't be bothered with them.
Well I tell you why I haven't been buying currants lately  cos they've been so blooming expensive!
Oh!
Are they?
I think  if I make a cake today I I'd rather put  sultanas in.
Mm.
Derek, doesn't he like er candy peel either?
Because 
Well 
mixed fruits is  that's only fifty five now!
Yes.
I might get some mixed fruits.
He's 
Yeah.
he's tasted your marmalade.
Oh what does he think of it.
I, I had a little taste.
I'm not very keen on marmalade.
Aren't you?
No.
Well what did you think of it then?
Well I think it was nice.
But I just don't like bits.
Oh I  erm, no you don't?
No, I don't.
No.
And marmalade's 
I love bits!
too strong for me.
But I'll make, I've got to make the other half of it, so when I make the other half of it he can probably have, er have a couple of jam ones 
No.
He's got enough there.
Oh Lord!
Never mind he can  I mean, I had to, I want you to have it all anyway.
I like baking it for him!
He, he enjoys it!
I like doing it.
Derek says to me something, he said  all condensation in Jean's kitchen!
Yes there was.
I said, well I'll ask her what 
Mm.
that was.
Yes, and I, and I wiped down one side
Yeah.
And then I forgot to wipe the other side
Yeah.
And then I forgot to wipe the other side 
Couldn't see it.
No it's by, I noticed it particularly by the  tray.
Ah!
I I think I was interrupted.
I think the builder called me
Oh!
And then, I forgot.
Right.
Yeah.
And, er, and I noticed there was lines there and I thought oh, I must wipe that 
Yeah.
and then I forgot all about it.
But no, I'm going to get an extractor now though Marg.
Actually in erm  our bathroom  and when we have a bath and a shower it always runs all down 
Yes.
the tiles, so I don't think you can do anything about it now.
No.
And I think, all those windows I've got in that kitchen.
You see, you've got the cold air coming in because you got so many, even with double glazing you got 
Yeah.
cold coming in.
Yeah.
And, and you see I've got no confa , I've got no erm  ventilation in the  erm .
I can't understand that!
Well why doesn't, can't he do something about that or does he 
Yes.
Well, when I get the bath  
Yeah.
I can do.
Cos 
Ca 
I said to them  er, I've got no ventilation there, I said, I'd need something.
He said, oh that's easily done.
Well erm  erm  the chappie who did my door said, oh, there's no problem there you can easily put ventilation 
Ah well.
in there.
Oh.
But it does need it.
I don't know
And the only thing that erm  worries me 
See we've got air bricks up around ours.
Yes.
We got two.
Yeah.
You got .
I can't understand how they managed to get  
Well don't they put air bricks in places?
Well they should do, I would have thought.
Mm mm.
I thought they should do.
Yes!
I mean when yo , always up there, I think it's the electrician when he was doing the  he said to me  you know, you've got a lot of condensation in your loft.
I said, well I'm not surprised cos there's no ventilation.
No.
And he said no, he said no .
Oh I should get that done because it might do something.
I dunno.
Well it's for , I, I I can't understand why erm  i i it's not been do , sort of not done ba by now because, oh yes.
Perhaps they didn't bother.
Perhaps they didn't ever go up in the loft.
Well isn't it strange!
Wonder you can get up  into 
Yes.
I got all up there and I can't 
You know  
Yes.
You live up in your loft don't you?
Well no.
I said to the builder I've got more up there than I've got downstairs!
 
He laughed!
I just  walk over things  I 
Mm.
tread over things 
Well ours is sort of, well Derek  I told you, new ye , new year on the Sunday he went up and just threw some of ours out.
And I 
Well 
don't know the  I don't think he's left much space
Mm.
I'm going to, well, oh I keep on saying this, but when I've got all this off my back  I'm going to be quite ruthless!
I'm going to 
Oh!
get rid of that.
Well for me !
Quite ruthless for me.
Oh dear!
Erm  but erm  there's lots of stuff I can get rid off.
Well I'm going to start selling some of it Marg.
Now, that waffle maker  now I, use that waffle maker about twice 
Ah!
I'm going to sell that.
Mm.
Get rid of that.
Mm.
I'll put an advert up in the er, er Quicksave and er 
Yeah.
That was a, er do , do people make them now?
I think you can buy 
It was a rage wasn't it?
You can buy them 
Yeah.
in shops, so I 
Yeah.
mean, you can't buy them, the actual waffle makers now.
You can't 
Can't you?
No.
Oh!
So I think, possibly,somebod , and I got all the recipe books 
Mm.
and everything there you see, so  they're not working in the
Dining room.
I always keep my instructions, always.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think they'd sell.
And I think, my recipe books.
I've erm    when Amanda and Claire were younger I bought a  milk shake  thing from 
Oh yes!
the milkman and that was, that's stuck in the cupboard.
Yeah.
I said to Amanda when you get your own home you can, she loves milk shake!
Does she?
So I said 
 
you can, and then I thought  well if I ever do get grandchildren, no, I'll keep it.
You can keep it.
Yeah!
 
That'll be lovely!
Go round to grandma and have a milk shake.
And I've got a wok up there that I've never used.
Have you got a wok?
Oh no!
I never waste your time on it Marg!
I didn't know what to do with it!
Sell it!
No, I'm gonna give it to Amanda and Claire because they'll use it.
Oh will they?
They only have vegetarian food but they'll use it.
And I did use it once and I got in such a temper!
Yeah.
Cos you have to have it so  the gas so high, it must be really boiling hot  and you just stir fry the vegetables all round this
Oh!
er thing, and I thought I might as well use a frying a pan!
Yes!
But that's what I, all these gadgets, when you have these gadgets Marg  it's more fuss taking out the gadget and washing 
Ooh yes!
it up afterwards, than it is by 
Mm.
doing it by hand!
Mm.
I find that with my erm  erm  what do yo ,mi food mixer.
Yeah.
I don't use it sometimes.
Only 
Er

No, I never mix pastry.
It gets all, urgh!
Well I fix up, cos I make a lot of erm  those er  dribbled scones on the top
Mm.

Have you?
I'm waiting for you to make those things in your erm
What in my sandwich maker?

Yeah.
I'll go in there, I'll get a 
Ah yeah.

Yeah.

Well I like to have a toasted sandwich for dinner.
I forget about it.
Yeah, but I can't have much.
I mean, I can only have  fo lunchtime with Claire, like, I've been having tomatoes on toast and some .
Horrible aren't they?
Yeah.
And they've gone all, you see I haven't been eating them so they've been in the fridge and they've gone all soft.
And I thought, well that's not very interesting!
So I sprinkle about three strands of cheese.
Have you got any marmite?
Now marmite's .
And what I'm going to do today, I've got erm  ah  I I've got a button on these things  I got some mashed potato 
Yo ?
No I won't.
I I've got some mashed potato and carrot there  I'm going to put some onion on top of that  I'm going put 
What , cut up or rings?
No, I'm just gonna put  so , erm
No the onion.
er, chopped up finely.
Chopped up?
Ah, not rings?
No.
Put that on the top  and I'm going to put  marmite on the  the base 
Doesn't it bulge out the bread?
Well I don't, I'm   bread  and I might some of it on the top.
Well don't you put weight on?
No.
I had, I've had cheese, I've  I got I   lot of erm, on erm piccalilli and erm  sweet pickle.
Claire's got to have pi pic piccalilli.
She has Branston  sandwich  she likes, not the ordinary pic , have you seen the  sandwich pickle?
It's been chopped up much smaller.
Oh has it?
Either that or , they like this.
They like this cos it's smaller.
Oh yes!
Oh I like the chunks 
Yeah.
in it?
But she likes the lumps in er, I was gonna buy some pickled onions today, till I saw the price!
I thought blow that!
Why do why don't you make some?
Oh yeah.
Ne next year I'm gonna pickle some onions.
Well you can pickle some for me .
I erm
But last time I did them I didn't put enough salt in them
No.
They were a bit plain this
Oh.
So I I, next time I'm gonna put lots 
Well don't put too much salt in!
Well you've got to.
But it does  away.
Yeah.
so I threw them away again.
Oh did you?
Mm.
Oh!
I don't eat 
Just a  
many and I've stopped eating them at Christmas when I brought them and I started eating them again.
I I just li like 
Oh I see.
Yeah, but they didn't have salt on these.
So I tho , I thought, you don't  do you?
Ooh I, yes!
Have you?
Yes!
Oh!
Because erm
Not the big one do you?
Well, I I
Big one?
Are you short of them?
Well I wear pop socks.
Alright I'll wash them out and I'll 
Mm.
let you have them.
Yeah.
I was gonna take, I thought perhaps you didn't want anymore.
Oh yes I want some.
Well I'll erm  wash them out, let you have those.
Yeah.
If you wash those tops thoroughly
Yeah.
put them back on, it .
Yeah, well I'll let 
Yes.
you have those.
Could have the lot, I mean, I know, but erm
Much better.
I did have a load of that tops and I took them all down the  .
So I got fed up, fed up with, a lot of , it's always full up!
It'll be murder!
Yes!
Well why doesn't he 
Yeah Yeah!
empty them!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I think you see people are basically green minded Marg.
Yeah I certainly am.
Went down there with all the wine bottles  from Christmas  don't do but  and then it's completely ruined!
People were just leaving boxes of them on the  in the car park.
I  , I thought the
Yes.
the lads could come aco , along there and smash them!
Yeah.
They should clear it!
And I, and not only that, I mean, if they're selling it to help with the poll tax, I mean all that money's 
Yeah.
going isn't it?
Ooh I know !
Yeah.
I don't know, I'm not sure which ones yo , I just notice what says recyclable on them.
I don't think you can put them all in now.
I thought they had to say recyclable .
I thought you put any of them in.
I dunno.
I don't know.
I think you could do.
And in this last bottle bank, it used to say up there  green, clear, brown and other you see.
Well, they o , they haven't bothered up there, so I think people, I mean I was doing it, I was  , she sort of shoved them in this thingie and I looked up and it said, green!
Well what   well 
Well they've got a green bottle and they, they melt it down, it's gonna look green isn't it?
And ha , you see all the bottles are going to look, multi- coloured bottles  
So I thought well, we've, we've, but I didn't see that.
I said to Claire, I said, I'm sticking them in the wrong one.
She said well it's too late now, the  the clear one's full  so we just  anyway, went I went down the next day there's a new one or, next time, there's a new one down there    so they, they must obviously think, well  put them all in together.
Yes.
Well 
I do , don't know if you're supposed to pi , take the labels off are you?
You ta , you're supposed to take the tops off.
They don't like you putting the tops in there.
Well I should think you're supposed to take the labels off.
Well I notice some people do don't they?
Well I always take the labels off.
Yes.
I normally take them off.
Yeah.
A jam jar, now we take 
Yeah.
the things off.
I didn't  well I, and I took the labels off the plastic bottles as well, but I notice people don't.
Erm  with them,i they don't need tins do they?
Ordinary tins?
No, it's Coke isn't it?
Erm
Mm.
Aluminium cans 
Yes.
they want.
Like Coke.
Yeah.
Well I was thinking if you do this it helps with  doesn't it?
Well, not only that Marg, it help  I mean, all that waste, it helps with the environment 
Yes.
anyway.
Yeah.
Erm, and I think  this .
Yeah.
I mean, that's why  a lot of people have gone over to recycled erm  toilet rolls  because  fancy cutting down trees just for that!
And tissues.
Yeah!
Recyclable tissues as well.
And it's awful when you think all of those trees you can cut down 
Mm.
in a park.
And I'd rather use newspaper now rather than use use erm 
Just us doing it won't, won't stop it.
Pe lot's of people will do.
And I think lots of people 
Erm, I don't know.
I look in peoples'  erm  shopping trolleys at Tesco and they er  don't seem to er
Don't they?
No.
And, nothing may  me  to buy it now unless it's recycled.
No.
I don't always do that.
I try to get recycled erm  notepaper and 
Mm.
Yes I wo , and  it's no more expensive Marg.
You can get birthday cards a on recycled paper.
Mm.
And I 
Mind , they're a bit more expensive.
And I know the Post Office prices have gone up with er  cards.
Post Office are very good!
Well they didn't use to be
Oh!
on cards.
Oh!
I thought you meant you were .
They used to do birthday cards in there, in the Post Office.
They used to be from tha , and they still are in there.
Yeah.
See, the others, they're all about ninety nine
Ah!
That's terrible!
for blank birthday cards, but in there they're  forty, fifty for cards.
They're a lot cheaper.
Mm.
But I refuse er, spend that on.
Yeah.
They'll think, ah it's only  it's the thought that counts anyway isn't it?
Er, the only thing I don't like about cards is now they've got these .
No, I don't like them.
No, I don't like them either.
I don't even buy them for Derek.
No I, I can't spend that.
No I don't like them.
I just like it when you open it it says happy birthday.
Well, yeah.
That's right.
Or best wishes or some 
Yes.
Yeah.
Some something simple 
Yeah.
yes.
Well it's not meant anyway.
Well it's  such strong stuff.
That's right.
It's not meant.
is.  sentimental isn't it?
Yeah.
And I think and perhaps when I was younger I used to buy it for Derek, but I wouldn't go there now, no.
He does?
Does he?
He doesn't really does he?
Just looks a card and buys it.
I bet he doesn't he even read what was in .
That'll do for her!
But some of 
Well 
them
really!
you pick a funny thing, ooh isn't that funny!
Yeah.
It'll just do for someone.
Yeah.
Mind you, it's not the same as those stupid 
Yeah.
Card 
erm 
things, yeah.
verse inside inside!
Mm.
I bought Amanda a card yesterday cos she was a bit down so I thought, oh I'll send her one  a card, and I got one from .
It's an old fashioned mangle, like mum used to have  in the picture.
When I phoned up she said what a lovely card!
I said no!
 
Cos that was forty nine I said.
Yeah.
Oh, she said, I'm gonna frame that one mum.
That's nice!
Really , really nice it was!
Yes.
That was nice.
Thought she was a bit down so I thought well I'll er  send her a card.
They had a good job in the paper  erm  , part of the school.
But it was only for year.
But it's actually temporary that's what I'm, and erm  it wan , it was starting in April so that was no good!
Ah!
Ah!
temp, you know.
They can keep the names in the school.
That's what they do, they have a year off  er totally, then they go back again.
Well you can't  got a mortgage 
Oh no!
and what have you.
No.
But I think that won't be a problem.
No.
But I don't, not only that Marg, I mean, it's become like a , but the only thing I do object to is these people marching about, and they don't want to help pay for their children's  
No.
No.
and they want the funds, the the pennies there don't they?
And nobody to  erm, pay the costs of it.
, but  you can't expect it all!
No, I wish erm  you worked that as well.
Cos I was telling the children .
Yeah.
cos people who get their noses in there .
So I was  trying not to talk .
But I still don't think it hurts children to .
Some it does.
Some it does.
Some it erm, I mean, I'll go  Claire'll say, clean up the house!
Clear up this mess!
Well, as a family we overreact.
I'm saying that but I , went on holiday with Mary  and I was three years older than Mary and mum said to me  ooh look after her Mary!
And it wasn't
I've never felt so embarrassed in my entire life Marg!
No, but I think it's very difficult for a mum.
Because what is done, I mean  when I was in hospital his mum used to that  try and pick up 
Yeah!
your stuff.
Yeah, but there's a , I can see how she does it because  you've done it al , you know, for  sixteen, seventeen years
Can't get out of it.
can't get out of the habit.
No.
But I don't mind getting in  in the family , but  you   I always remember, when David was growing up, he was about seventeen or eighteen, his friends came round, they were going out somewhere and grandma was there  and she said to, er to us in front of erm David's friends  oh isn't he a pretty boy!
I
never, the look on everybodys' faces!
I mean, imagine what his friends thought!
And David's   and his face coloured down 
Mm.
you know.
Ah but you never .
Well, oh isn't he, I can see  when she looking at him was looking at him, that's what .
Yeah.
Oh!
And he, and he
Mind you,.
You know,.
No!
Yeah, but you do forget sometimes, you sa , you still think they're  ..
Yeah !
You know and  what do you think I am?
An and, and things like that, and yo it's automatic.
Mm.
And if want to check quickly in a car and I'm driving I automatically put the hand 
Now you know 
I've done that to Pam and she couldn't stop laughing!
Going along driving .
I said, I'm sorry Pam, I keep thinking your Ma Amanda .
Now it hadn't occurred to me to do that because I never had kiddiwinks.
No, you see, I automatically  do it you see.
Yeah.
driver!
 
It is funny!
But then, I suppose, really  erm, you never think when you're forty like, you never think of them
I don't think so.
I don't think that now.
I know, now, you could  but, but Derek's reading that prospectus in the car today and it's, it's in Cardiff and he said  they write in there and say that  you know, they want mature students and, and, and this that and the other, and er, they give them erm, priority and  well that's rubbish!
?
Well they, they sort of near enough said she wouldn't
Oh!
And yet, in the prospectus it does, yeah 
Yeah.
so I mean really they say, they're all going  in there and perhaps she's not mature enough.
And I said, what do they call mature?
And he said over twenty ones.
I said .
Well well well, she's mature enough.
But erm  will she be very disappointed?
Yeah.
last night.
When they say oh,, well they won't.
I said well what if they do?
I said they won't!
Oh deary me!
She's quite upset then?
Mm.
She doesn't want to work today.
Yeah well she has to.
No.
You can't force her.
Just says, I don't wanna talk about it!
But she can't!
Well that's what she does you see.
She's talks about you  if she doesn't want to talk about it, she won't, she'll just walk out the room.
Yeah.
You see, the trouble with Claire is, she runs away from it.
Mm.
But I did, I thought how unlike Claire.
And I thought  those two girls on Friday, that play.
Derek said, bored to tears!
But er  i it was hot in there which made me feel sicky, but I enjoyed it Marg!
Now if that was Amanda there, like at the pantomime 
Yeah.
you see
And you don't get 
you sit , that's why I don't like going to the theatre with Derek, he, he doesn't clap or anything!
No!
Well a waste of time .
Well I mean ,th the thing is those poor people have got up there and 
Mm.
he says they're doing the re , rehearsing for what?
Eight weeks did he say?
A long time.
Yeah.
Every night I expect.
But I thought they were good.
Er, the only one I didn't like was erm  but she looked quite so  Claire would call .
Oh I thought the blonde girl was a 
Yes.
bit wooden.
Well, she wasn't as wooden as the other one.
I mean, she was quite credible, but the other one wasn't even credible.
Yes.
Yeah I didn't look like it was her.
Ooh she was very !
Yeah.
Well I 
And that that  
I did see cos she was er
Aunty Mary?
Yeah.
But I, I liked the  the first outfit she came on with that sash wrapped round her 
Yeah.
skirt and  blouse and then
Yeah.
She did look nice!
Yeah.
And so simple 
Yeah.
but so nice wasn't it?
Yeah.
But I thought the other girl was good.
Er  well I thought it was good how they did the se se scenes, they were 
Yeah.
.
So that was good 
Yeah.
wasn't it?
But, didn't one girl look crumpled?
She ought to have an iron on er, the backstage.
She   Well I thought she was good though.
No, I thought she were, I thought goodness knows !
Yes, but then she was .
Derek said they'd been having sex!
Oh I
She was .
I said, he says th no, they'd have that other girl, but she was quite  roly-poly.
Remember that  one we went to see her, and sh she undressed?
Oh yes!
She  
She was a real !
Yes!
There's plenty to warm up there!
Yeah!
But then the other girl was like stick wasn't she?
Oh!
I know.
But I thought it was quite good!
And I thought 
Derek said Jean won't want to go again.
Ooh I will!
Yes she will.
I think she was just a bit hot.
Ooh I will!
I said, in fact, when she's got herself sorted out we'll go down to  Poole Art Centre and see 
Yes.
some plays down there.
I'd like to.
Yes.
We'll get  the  he's not coming!
No!
Ge , if Amanda's, well Amanda loves it so when 
Mm.
she comes down, she'd 
Yes!
really love going!
Yeah!
Erm 
I like it.
But no, I I enjoyed it, other than the fact that  it was so hot in there!
Well, you did have your gloves on.
You did have your fur boots on.
No, they're fur.
Derek said he'd   no but Derek said he felt 
No.
too hot!
Well, you see, the trouble is Marg I go out on my bike and I think, ooh it's cold I'll  and then I forget going in the 
Yeah.
coach.
She, I said, I didn't have any gloves
Yeah.
and I did miss them.
Yeah.
It was hot in, I mean everybody was very red faced 
Ooh!
weren't they?
I, I don't think 
Yeah, but it's  your hot flushes !
Oh I know!
, yeah.
But, you know 
.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But then Claire came home with me.
Cos we missed Coronation Street didn't we last night?
Oh yes!
And I didn't record it because we wanted to record something  but actually, I don't, I think Coronation Street .
Well I  had once.
Did you?
Yes, I mean I, some episodes are better than others I suppose.
 
Oh well you can pick it up again.
Yeah.
But I tell you one person who's getting on my nerves is that good looking son at McDonalds.
Yeah?
Her?
And he's so hammy!
The other one is good.
Mm.
But this one's so hammy!
Mm mm.
A nice looking boy though.
But that, the trouble is, he's knows it!
Mm.
But I don't know how they can have them as twins do you?
No.
Mind, not all twins are identical are they?
But I still prefer the other one.
Yeah.
I think he's a nice boy that one.
Yeah,bu bu bu perhaps the other one will be nice when he 
Mm.
gets older.
And I thought, you know, Tracey's getting to him.
Yeah.
Oh!
She's a lovely person!
Yeah.
Yeah, but she .
Yes!
You know, she came home  and she was watching television and I bought some  Bourbon biscuits round and then I thought I'll have one with my cup of tea and now there's three left!
I said, do you realise you've eaten the whole packet!
She doesn't know what she's doing!
See, well, she just puts her hand in, eats it, hand in, eat, that's, she doesn't even know what she's doing!
Oh she didn't!
I said you're gonna get a 
Just take a couple and put them on a plate!
I said you're gonna put weight on, if 
Yeah!
you're not careful!
Especially Bourbon biscuits.
I said but er   
Yeah.
it was only a little bit.
Yeah, but you, so, think of all calories!
Have you?
Oh years ago!
Yes.
I tell you what I like , I used to like er   er  Digestive.

Yeah I know.
They say

Well they've got .
Oh yeah!
Did they get your  toilets or not?
No!
Oh they didn't have one?
No, it's a  portable bit er 
No!
He couldn't get it.
Yo , I'll have to make sure he takes that off the bill too!
Yeah!
No.
He said you could have one but I, it's like a tent.
I said oh I don't mind.
Oh no!
Mind, I
it, you know, but when I do the slightly, yes I have to cross my legs between time!
Oh dear!
Twenty pounds a night  
Can you hear that stupid noise again?
Listen.
What is it?
That's the water pressure.
Oh!
Why don't you wash your hands in the bathroom?
No it's   isn't it?
Oh well
Erm
goodness me Jean!
If they haven't thought about that!
Erm  i then all of sudden   the tiles they got in there are they?
And I said that
Where, in there?
Yes.
Yeah, well they were tiled nicely.
Yeah!
It's the ones upstairs Derek said about.
I want like you, you've got some  
Yeah.
aren't you?
Yeah but Derek made those himself.
Did he?
Yes.
He didn't tile them but he 
No , it's very nice!
make them himself.
But I'm quite pleased though Marg, with my 
I'm, I'm cold!
square bit.
It's not bad is it?
Well I think it looks nice!
I I, I said to Derek, I don't know why Jean's so
No.
she was a  disappointed!
I think a  a bit over-fussy about it I think.
Yeah, but that's cos of Joe.
Yes I know!
Oh well I haven't had anybody so fussy.
No.
He would have erm, if, he'd seen the erm  those two  bi bits in that door, or  there's some o of a sort of slightly  wider than other a little bit, he'd have gone !
Yeah.
They all seem a bit wide, I must admit.
I , I noticed too, that he hasn't got it straight like over the  
Oh hasn't he?
No?
Well , one or two of them are a bit sort of 
Yeah , but er, some of them are a bit out of true cos they're seconds do you think?
Could be.
I don't know.
They may have been so  er the 
But erm  yes, but Joey would have gone nuts!
Yeah.
Actually, that's why Derek's never done tiling, cos he's not very good at it.
Mm.
Well Joey, mind you, it used to take Joey such a long time.
Yeah.
And, it used to take Joey such a long time that erm  but still, I I must try and get out of that, but the trouble is it's in me now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't think er  but I want it done properly, see what I mean?
Well I thought it looked, I thought it looked all right.
Yeah.
Well I, when I went in this morning  after you'd seen it, and I thought oh!
Perhaps it's not so bad after 
No.
all.
It's the  I not , I mean he should have grouted that little bit  and he shouldn't have put 
Yes he should.
that tile there actually.
But then, Derek said they haven't got the time to
No.
fiddle he said.
Now, with Joey, he would have 
He would of 
had all day.
gone over once with 
Yeah.
with , he'd have put them on one side and said 
Yeah.
we'll put those at the top you see.
Yeah, but you see, they haven't got the time to do 
No.
that.
You don't want them there any longer do you?
No he  he works hard when he's 
Yeah.

He works hard.
I I didn't think he was that untidy, but Derek thought that was awful leaving all that outside!
Ooh ooh!
Do you know Margaret I go back and it looks so dirty!
But they know you're not like that don't they, round and about?
They know you've got builders there.
 
You wanna see Pam's house!

Yeah.
I, do the inside  and he should 
Well he shouldn't have left tiles outside somebody could have taken those!
He's left !
And I thought, don't look in there!
No.

I just try and close my eyes to it 
Yeah.

Derek's are mainly , there's a sort of few new ones but
Yeah, that's right.
Mind, not everybody's got the money to erm  pay for jobs have they, today, if they've been made redundant they haven't got the money.
No.
I think it's gonna better though don't you?
Well I think it's gonna get worse before it's gets better actually, I think it's erm  I don't know.
I'm lucky enough I don't seem to get any out, you know, the times that I've said  oh I'm not bothering this year.
I actually got them back 
Oh!
.
Oh I think they ought to have them cleaned every year don't you?
Yeah.
That one's sort of exploding a bit again, like something I know when it does,it needs cleaning !
It all makes a funny noise!
Yeah.
It's sort of a louder noise than normal this, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I think oh well, it's about time you came.
Yeah.
Actually, probably, could do with a new boiler thing I should think.
A bit old isn't it?
Ain't it?
Yeah.
Mm.
so you need a new one.
Oh do you?
Oh!
How long did it take you to get down here?
About three quarters of an hour does it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
A bit longer today cos of the fog.
Well yeah.
It was bad this morning.
Was it?
Oh.
We went for a  week's holiday at  Salisbury .
Oh did you?
Well, cos of my back last year  I couldn't go very far so we thought, where can we go for a break?
And we went, we had a nice time.
It was great!
Where did you stay?
In erm  yes, it's the ring road, in a a a listed building.
What was the road called?
Do you know as you come in to Salisbury and you have to keep going  on with the traffic, then it leads up to the  bridge where the wa , where the river is.
That ro , what's it called?
It's got like the back of the supermarket, back of the er Marks and Spencers.
No I don't know what it's .
No.
Was it?
Oh!
Yeah!
throwing people out.
There's about 
But 
five rivers in Salisbury.
Oh are there?
And there's a      
Yeah, they're all listed aren't  but as we came  we came in the way we would come, I'm a bit ignorant, so I suppose we were 
that's where you got the top, the first thing you come to is
That big
the roundabout er with a petrol garage at the top
Yeah you
then you go down a bit 
Yeah.
to another roundabout 
Yeah.
and then did you follow the ring road round through the ?
Yes, the ring  ring road round, yes, and then you
College.
Yeah.
The next thing round is the church .
Yeah, well i , on the left?
Or on the ri 
Sort of op , nearly opposite   that's the London Road that is.
Yeah, then I think we went  is there a road to left?
Yes.
Yeah.
Is there?
And road again drops you down into the, you go on the ring road of course,
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't remember.
Anyway, it was a lon , there's a little restaurant in the road, and it was back of sort of erm  Mar , if you wal , you crossed over and if you went through a little slip where it came, you came into this little arcade of shops where o , about  in the road  next to er 
I know where it is!
You just told me it was, yes.
Don't ask me!
That sounds about  right !
Yeah.
That's sounds about the name.
New Street?
Yeah.
I think that's in New Street.
But the hospital ?
It was by the hospital.
It was in the road of the hospital.
We were down, we were down much further and the hospital was that  opposite the park, like, is it the park or something?
Yeah, there is a park.
No, we overlooked erm  a horrible block of flats!
That was very nice, the outlook there, but the outlook at the back was ever so, it was beautiful!
Cos we could see  the spire of the cathedral.
I think it was in, it was in the, but it was in the back road of the hospital, not the front road.
The back kind
.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
I think there's a park there.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, ever so, we enjoyed it.
But it was very cold.
Was it?
Yeah, can't remember where we went.
My memory's hopeless!
You know, it was sometime last year and I can't remember if it's early or late.
But it was quite nice, we had a nice time.
There's lots of little walks to go on aren't 
Yeah.
there?
Round er, and they're all  qui , er nice shops there.
Oh!
So wa 
Enjoyed it!
got to the old mill then did you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it was nice.
We thoroughly enjoyed it!
I expect can you?
What kind is there?
Yo you can see why  
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I think it's quite nice.
The only thing is, I think it's quite a way for you to travel isn't it?
Erm  I mean, you don't always come here do you?
Mm mm!
Oh!
Do you come here every day?
Mm mm!
Oh!
I don't know if I'd wanna do that every day.
Is it worse in the summer?
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't know i 
But it's always better, it's not, coming in cos then all the tourists are coming back 
Yeah.
to go to bed.
That's right.
Because when we came home, we came home on a Friday night, I say, and oh, the traffic!
Mm!
I think it took us about an hour and a half to get home!
Mm.
Especially coming up,co , just coming up to Salisbury, coming up to all those roundabouts.
Mm!
Cor!
We thought we wished we'd left earlier now.
Mm.
It was, no I mean  thoroughly enjoyed it!
We'll try and be a bit more adventurous this year and go a bit further!
But I can't sit in the car very long.
It's terrible!
It's a problem.
Where do you hope to go?
Well I was thinking of Cambridge but I don't think I, Derek's going to Holland
Mm.
for a long weekend to do with  er, every ten years there's a garden thing in Holland, I don't, forget what they call it.
Flor  Florade or something.
I can't go.
I couldn't tra , it's er, on a coach.
I couldn't do it.
So he's going to Holland for  three or four days.
So I'm er  I said perhaps, because Steve li , have you been to Cambridge?
 
No.
Steven said it's nice at Cambri , I think we've been through it.
Yeah.
Yeah, but it's quite, I don't know how to, it's about three hours I should think.
You know.
Have to wait and see.
Cos you  could break the journey up a bit?
Yeah.
I'd have to do it every hour.
I can't sit for much longer than an hour.
It's a pain innit!
I never thought I'd have back problems!
Mm.
Nearly everybody you talk to  the fact, they have back problems.
It's a wonder you don't get them lifting boilers and things!
Yeah, well .
Yeah.
And I said, Derek has to be careful, because you don't know when you
Yes.
And he was doing, and they're humping a lot of  concrete last week and I think his  back's aching.
I said, now you know how I felt!
How are your children?

Mm.
There's not much for them to do at all.
No there's not.

But 
He 
Sorry!

I just think two or three years ago they took a    
Mm!
kids, and then 
Yeah.
wha , what was gonna happen when they all had to go back to work
Yeah.
I think    mind, a lot of the problem is because women have gone back to work isn't it?
Cos I mean, lots of women have to work today don't they?
For them to make
Pay the mortgage.

Yeah!
Sad really!
And Amanda didn't like our own school, cos she finishes her teacher training college this year.

I can't believe it's four years.
But apparently,yo you get wage increases in teaching.
It's just had one haven't they?
It's going up I think.
But, the longer you stay the more wages you get.
Yeah.
But now what's happening is, they're getting rid of the old ones cos they pay them too much!
Yeah.
And get ne new ones in.
I don't think, I feel a bit sorry for her because at the moment they're running a teaching  profession down so much aren't they?
Always!
Feel a bit sorry for her, but she seems to be enjoying it so  .
That's the way to do it !
Oh dear!
The frog's have  laid some more frogspawn out there.
What?
The frogs.
Oh!
Put down some more spawn, yeah.
