We got loads of tins of that didn't we?
That'll do!
I'll put the spaghetti on.
Oh!
There's a problem here isn't there?
You never know how much to use.

Do you want some carrots with that?
Er!
Tinned 
Yes?

Tinned carrots in there?

Well I just tend to stick it in and see how much there is there.
Well  I'm putting another load in then alright?
Yeah alright then.
Just chuck it in, I'm starving!
I need loads of food!
Well I don't wanna get a whole pile of spaghetti and no filling alright?
No er  bolognaise.
Mm.
Oh God!
You're making a mess again aren't you?

Gross!
With nutmeg and cinnamon, mm!
Lovely!
I'd rather just have Ambrosia really.
You're a bore aren't you?
Oh, alright then I suppose.
Well keep the old bolognaise stirred so that it heats up all round.
So what did your mum and dad have to say then?
Well  mum said were we gonna come down over the weekend?
Well, I mean, we had the opportunity, you know chit-chat job  and mum said are we gonna go down over the weekend?
I said, oh perhaps they could come up to us  you know, I didn't know quite at the moment what our plans were for over the weekend.
How many of these er  do you want in there?
I drain the  fluid off 
Yeah 
yeah?

Erm  have you put the ketchup in?
Nope!
You'll need to.
Don't overdo the ketchup, it makes it all 
Oh alright, no alright.

Yeah, alright.
Erm  cos I I, well I didn't know what  you had planned for tomorrow afternoon though.

What time does the auction end?
Nine.

They're already cooked anyway aren't they?
Yeah.
Well
Just heat them up really.
no need to heat them up then.
Keep an eye on the spaghetti.
Any more in there?
How much did I put in?
About two sort of  lengths like that.
No, I should put another bit in.
Bit more, alright.
 
Well I think what we'll do is  one day we'll weigh the amount of spaghetti and then we'll know exactly how much to put in next time won't we?
I think I'm gonna get up nine o'clock actually and be quite productive  some washing.
It's alright, I'll finish the tea up.
So Sharon sent me, lent me this, that's sweet of her.

Alright.
Have you turned the  the heat down?
I did on the  the bolognaise, yeah  otherwise it'll get boiled to a pulp!
Ah right.
Okay then.

I would have thought you'd be able to heat that stuff up again but   Ha!
Phorgh!
Jesus!
No don't, leave it!
No, it's fine!
I was trying to talk you turn it off then.
You're worried about your privacy being invaded aren't you?
Yeah, suppose so.
Well, there's no need is there?
Ooh, it's hot!
You're not burning yourself are you Mark?
Is this erm  is this done then?
Ya.
Are you supposed to put hot water over like you do with rice?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.
Otherwise it's all slimy, isn't it?
That's right.
Yeah.
Well you should of told me!
Put the kettle on then will you?
Okay.
It's only just boiled hasn't it?
No, no, no, it hasn't cos I've just used it all  for the erm 
 
No!
Or did you refill it?

I know it's just boiled.
 
Get the plates out for me?

Oh.
Look, you can serve out for once I'm sta , tired!
You do it alright?
Alright.
All you gotta do is chuck it on  on top and grate a bit of that on for me.
Oh you can grate the cheese surely?
Bring me the bloody cheese grater in the !
Well you just got it out the cupboard didn't you?
No it fell out!
Where's today's paper?
Erm  I had, oh it's in 
 
in the lounge.
Can't have done cos .
But last time  do you remember this time last year it got so that his foot was really puffy?
Yeah.
And erm  we had him on  two lots of antibiotics  before he even had an anaesthetic to get the inflammation down and I don't want it to get worse!
And he couldn't drink while he was on those could he?
He couldn't drink!
But erm  no, I mean
No drink, no sex Charles!
He said look you can have these expensive antibiotics, they were intensive ones, said look you know I don't want him to lose his bloody foot just give me some antibiotic!
And he co , and how much did he cost me, Charles?
Forty five pounds for that foot last year!
Well I think you should put him out to work!
Get some cash in!
Well  that's pretty incidental in the morning.
Mm.
Cos he's bound, I mean with all that mud and everything, I mean there's lots of  sheep droppings and god knows what up there isn't there?
Yeah I know, it needs treatment though darling.
Yeah, I know it still needs treatment but I mean it'll  try and get the swelling down a bit.
Yeah.
Well I don't think that it's swollen.
Well it's hot on .
Well it is, it is, yeah, it's a, there's a little of  flesh but nothing like  you know  it was when his foot got like that  do you see what I mean?
Mm mm.
Cold water.
But the problem is he's so
Oh shit !
it seems to have got sort of so much more deformed.
Julie's bloody claws!
I saw  today.
Talk of being put 
And he's running the stocks suddenly.
I mean I'm sure it's the same claw cos it's never grown back  you see, when he's had it cut off but  what the vet was hoping was that the claw would grow back and the the top of  of the tissue, see what I mean?
Mhm.
And what's happened is the tissue has grown and not the bloody nail!
Oh I see.
And and what 
Mhm.
it has done has just become distorted and it's splitting more away from the nail.
That'll be a problem tomorrow .
And when they get a bit long too, yeah.
I haven't, I'm just going to go to wee and then I'll have do those  it'll have to grow basically.
And unless we can .
Where's Jeff?
Ooh ooh ooh!
I dunno.
You heard biscuit didn't you boy?
Yes you
Well I know you're not giving them our biscuit but then we just get through .
They keep off the
That one was soft.

You better clear that !
 

So, somebody no doubt has gotta get up there to put them up wrong.
Yeah, she was telling us off.
Did you put any  out?
Yeah!aren't they?
Well it's pretty difficult actually to put a cupboard up a wall, I admit they're very easy to make up but  to actually hold this cupboard.
You just drill a couple of holes in the back you need 
Okay.
marking on the wall and drill two rawplugs!
I'll be interested.
It won't be easy Mark, to put those cupboards up!.
Well   I bet you they are !
Done.

With all these non-technical people and they're sort of going, what's that?
Is that a  a fart thing  to measure your farts with!
Shouldn't it be round that side?
No it's a microphone, recording conversations.

Everybody.

Well there's two mikes in there.

Oh, French, mm.
With a, with a Dutch accent!
You gotta have, some on there then?
Yeah!
I carry round, all round with me you see.
So who, is it a computer that listens to it?
Yeah, they put it all in a computer and then all the words are analyzed  and from the different accents and all that sort of, pronunciation.
Can I wear one then?
Well if you take part, if you're asked!
No, I  I mean I was on the phone and th , there was a knock at the door and this woman came round and said she was from  from the
Marky!
Yeah.
Here you are.
Oh!
Can't 
Do you wish to eat here?
Well it's very nice of you but we're gonna  gotta go to  Plaistowe cos of Charlie's claw you see?
Oh, I don't mind, I'm just 
And the surgery's only for an hour so 
I'm just fishing, to make sure to what to organize that's all.
I must pop round one evening next week.
The week's gone so quickly I've just been sort of, you know.
But next week er , oh evening, because you're working obviously!
Oh yeah.
Well Sue's away next week as well you see.
Yeah, yeah.
And Sarah  was asking after
Poeticisms.
That's already in the dictionary 
Poeticisms.
they're looking for words that aren't in there!
Well this isn't in,th th this isn't  
Well obviously!
Obviously are English 
Yeah 
words.
they're all words that are already in use, the ones we use in scrabble.
Otherwise that wouldn't do would it?
An 
Well 
and it's something to do with work then?
Don't sit 
No.
on the radio dear!
I'm not!
I'm was leaning on this, look!
God I don't this broken, this broke!
Do you get paid?
Did you, Mark?
I'm more worried about the glass!
Do you get paid for it?
Mm, twenty five pound gift voucher.
Which I wasn't told, she said twenty five pounds, so I thought ah, it'll do nicely!
Help top up the bank a bit!
For Sony?
For Sony?
No, I think it's probably for Longmans.
A gift voucher is er, just as handy, go to the shop and buy something which you want!
It's probably a book, it's 
Let's have a look at the tape?
probably a book token!
Or something.
Why are we all standing?
Haven't we got chairs?
I don't mind.
You can er, it's got a radio, the radio's brilliant!
I mean, you can walk, you could 
This is amazing innit!
you can move around, I was sa , wearing it in the kitchen yesterday, you can move around and it's er 
Can you put my name down?
I I'd 
They're saying that on, just now I was listening 
 
on Radio Three
But I don't !
and they were saying about people with er, F M problems and they got a big coat hanger 
Where is this big problem ?
in the back of  
Well it's 
and they can't get a reception 
 
and 
Mm.
anyway they was talking about getting a proper aerial, it's all basic stuff 
I mean you wouldn't wanna go anywhere where there was confidential things.
and they were talking about a new system which I couldn't hear because of vacuum cleaner was on
Was it?
Was it?
erm  which doesn't suffer from  er  multi-path  reception
Yeah.
so i , car radios and things like that the reception will be constant wherever you are because you don't get any noise.
They won't listen to it?
It'll just be analyzed in the computer.
I'm trying, trying to say they need some people to listen to that and  you know, to get the new words if that is the case.
Yeah, well what you do is they give you a sheet of paper  and th , you write down who was involved in the conversation, so all I'd say is, is erm  Mum 
Oh you 
Dad, or John, Elly  or  or something like that.
I th I mean they're not interested in  actual names, so if there's two Johns they put John one and John two.
That's the sort of idea.
So that if 
Well 
if they listen on another tape  all the 
What happens , what happens now that you know that somebody has said something very confidential, you know, a personal matter?
Well I just we , rewind it and then  tape over 
You can 
it.
oh, cause a 
Oh yeah.
complex.
And how long can, does this tape last?
Like if I, if if you know  if you say, oh I object to this, then I'd just turn it off and rer rer erase it.
Oh right.
Well what 
Oh I see.
i it's probably to do with new words like wa wally and things 
I was quite funny yesterday 
like that.
cos I had it running in the kitchen while we were cooking tea last night  and Sue came in and goes     a real big fart , and goes oh I haven't been able to fart all week,she says !
And she didn't know !
 
 
Yeah.
But er  according to Sharon she's been sitting alone in er  bed and breakfast and erm
Yeah, it's a nice bed and breakfast.
She's got her own  ensuite and  er
I know, but then she has nobody to chat to 
chap brings her a cup of tea at nine o'clock.
at night cos there's nobody here to have a conversation with.
No, I think she was  getting chatted up by the bloke who owned the place, really!
Mm.
Oh yeah?
Some chap runs it with his wife.
I see.
So what time is Sue er  coming?
Well I'll pick her up
Well  won't be home will she?
about quarter to and I'm coming back here.
she's having her hair done.
Yeah, get her to wait to do that.
Oh God, I've still got the dogs in the car, hang on!
Oh!
Do you want a hand?
Can I just dump them , dump them in the shed quickly?
Yeah.
I've hoovered up you can't bring them in here!
I won't bring them in here, put them in round back.
Can you get one?
The the door's not open.
Haven't got any shoes on.
I'll be back in a minute.
Show him where the key is.
She said she was from the 
 

Well it's sort of like market research type  type idea.
Oh!boy, you might like it.
So do you get to keep the Walkman?
Cor!
If only!
And how long do you have?
Just a week.
That all?
Do you wear it every day?
All day?
Well  I dunno whether I'll be able to use at work you see, I'll have to ask the  the governor.
Oh yes!
Yeah.
He might not like that at all!
I'll reckon they'll say no.
They probably will but
Yeah.
if they do well there's  not a lot we can do about it really.
Are you sure this works  at the moment.
, big word.
We want to  
Course it's working!
from , that's what it's really is.
The sound comes over !
No!
What did the ?
The sound comes over on what?
On the machine, you mean?
Yeah, and then hold it up, do you know what I mean?
Do want to sit me far away from you, will that still take it?
Oh yeah!
Will it?
Well it's got automatic level control on it.
On the recording.
It's one of those little mikes they have on television.
Automatic?
Honestly!
Well it just looks at the the signal level coming in and adjusts the gain accordingly.
When I shouted in it I thought you were joking.
Oh no, that'll just shut down the gain  and this 
Will it really?
probably still come out clear, yeah.
Mark.
Yes, ah well  the thing to do is to er  go down and hi , hire a Daily Mirror van and  wait for Mrs  to arrive!
Yeah.
Well I don't like it very much I must say!
I mean, there's your privacy gone!
You know?
Yeah but it's completely anonymous, and no one 's gonna know I'm talking to you are they?
No, I'm trying to say  what is behind all this  if you really think of it?
Well it's beg it's  to get the words  in everyday conversation 
Well,
isn't it!
I don't believe it's true, that's
Ha!
Well, I don't believe, they are after sound and the difference, you know, I mean you sit like this can you still hear me?
Or if you are in the kitchen, mum!
Well they're not gonna know!
Can you still hear that?
They're not  they're not, that's already been done hasn't it?
They've already, this is a commercial machine this thing, you buy them down at Dixon's.
New words!
My God surely they don't need ordinary people to have new words, they just  look around in universities!
That's where they go through for new words!
on colloquial
No!
erm
I reckon it's advertising, that's what it is  to see whether people are mentioning certain products.
Well, have you been using Daz Automatic recently!
Oh, dear oh dear !
No, I use !
 
Well  I'm thinking of conversations, you know?
That er  isn't anything to do with people spying for instance?
Oh nobody's gonna talk about that with this are they!
No, no, say , I'm talking, that is seeing the advantage of it you see.
Say, for instance erm  somebody wants to hear your opinion about and and get a, plans to  er  you know, to to , you you find that out for me, you know that's what I'm saying!
Well they wouldn't be carrying a bloody great mike like that 
Well 
round would you!
you could hide away it.
You can't, cos if it goes inside your jumper it ge , the sound all gets muffled.
They have to be on the outside right, cos as soon as it goes through a piece of material you'll lose all the high frequency to it.
Well, I don't like the idea of it very much !
Don't you ?
Well , wearing them out, things like that.
The thing to do is is to sort of er  plot to overthrow parliament or something and see if there's any reaction!
 
 
Yeah.
I couldn't wait to test it !
 
Or tell them , tell them there's a few million pounds worth of gold coins in some field!
This bloody great hole the next day there !
Bring all the  and shovels and  !
Do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had to laugh though cos I was talking  chap at work and  they'd sent round this erm  this form  right, to fill in about your opinion about the company and everything.
And said, so it's completely anonymous and all that  and he said oh I can't be bothered to send that in, so he chucked it in the bin   and they phoned him up and said why haven't you sent your form in ?
 
 
That's completely anonymous?
I thought, I thought you were going to say we found his form on  tip!
Something to do with the rubbish, that is.
Oh yeah.
Rupert Maxwell had everything taped didn't he?
All the offices .
Oh yes.
But who has he got employed to check it?
Well he hadn't got anybody that he would trust there you see
No, but I mean the whole day, I 
not even the people he paid 
talked  with a few people
Mhm.
an and then erm  you know, who's going to listen to that tonight, you know, to see what they've 
Mm.
been saying?
Mm.
You've got to have someone for that as well, you know!
Mm.
Yeah, and then an can he then  can you trust the staff?
No, I'll get you sheet of paper on erm  what it's about.
Oh I didn't bring it with me, I've only got my record book.
But the idea is 
to see you.
you fill out a little sheet of paper  with the, with the names like John A, John B or whatever, so that if there's another tape and you've marked John B and they missed a word, or what  what the word was and they  there's a chance that they might use it again later on you see.
Probably want some erm  articulate people .
Yeah.
Put down, the Buckingham Palace!
Ah, are they articulate?
well they obviously use the Oxford Dictionary, not Longmans so
Ha!
You've heard of Longmans haven't you?
The printers?
Longmans, yes.
Publishers.
It's the Longman's er, Dictionary.
There's more to it than meets the eye!
Oh mum, mum's always 
So do they 
had a suspicious mind hasn't she?
Yeah.
do they, do they erm  I mean, how do they analyze it?
Well
Do they listen  and le all the words that they recognize, they leave?
Those matches are .
But the ones that  they're not familiar with they lo look up do they?
I don't know, maybe they erm  a , they'll listen to the tapes  and they probably sample some of the words into a computer  to build up a database    of words that probably  like you said, oh he's getting a lot of jip from his boss, you know, is probably not in the dictionary  but if a lot of people said that word then they would.
Yeah, that's I meant.
Have to has to come into common use before it gets into the dictionary.
Yeah.
So if it was  
Yeah, that's right.
from actual people
That's why it's best not to tell people that you're doing it you see because then they  they're careful what they say.
Right.
You know.
I mean, they might  but it'll be a classic 
You can't help doing it though can you?
If you'd have made a story up that's it something else, I wo I wouldn't have known it's running.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you weren't have said ooh I  was listening on the phones and just a  leave it on, you know  the phones.
What always amazes me when we play scrabble  I mean, things that I consider to be slang  you know, on the odd time I thought well I'll try that 
Well it used to be slang.
and I put them in, and I look in my dictionary, they're not there of course, cos my  dictionary I had is from nineteen forty six
Mm.
look in even  er  ten years later it's there.
And tremendous number of of words which were  written in slang, they were almost obscenities er 
Well that's 
in there, you know.
that's why you need to change your dictionary every few 
That's right.
years.
Yeah, to keep up.
Ooh!
Your mother's kicking 
Ooh my ear!
you now!
Did you get that?
Oh yeah, we've seen it all now!
Oh dear!
Yeah.
Well I'll, I'm going up to the vet so I'll leave it running when we're in the vet.
Cos it's all different 
Have you switched it off now?
No.
Oh, what's that then?
They're the headphones.
So you can  play back and listen, make sure it's come out alright.
Yeah.
She certainly has the right bloke to do it.
Nobody else would have the patience!
You should have a hundred and fifty pound for it, not twenty five!
Well  it's no big deal really is it?
Just a case of  taking the tape deck around  and if you're not having a conversation yo you can use the radio so  I'm not really worried.
Oh can you?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh!
And they supply the batteries?
Yep.
And twenty tapes  which you erm  you don't have to use all them  just  you know, fill what you can
Can you keep the ones that you don't use?
No, you just give them back.
I used one of your tapes you brought me for Christmas yesterday,very nice!
Good quality one?
Yeah,
Mm.
in my old tatty machine!
Ooh, I've got some questions!
Ooh !
Go on then?
One will just be a quick, quickie.
Erm  Pete is 
Are they confidential?
Go on then.
Pete's interested in  obtaining a  tarmac, is it?
Erm, no, that's all I know.
A tarmac?
Erm, it's four track recording.
Oh  T-ach 
Oh  T-ach 
Tarmac !
I knew it was something like that.
Tarmac you get out of a  
Yeah.
Yeah, I wouldn't know.
Handy thing to have if you if your road .
Erm 
You wo won't be able to record a lot of music on it though.
Go on 
A four 
then.
a four track erm
Multi-track.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I told him that you had all the gear and I said that you wanted sixteen.
No.
Thirty two.
No, I was sixteen down the studio wasn't I?
What have yo , what have you got now then?
I got four track.
Four track.
Four track on half inch.
Oh, half of the tape.
Was it a cassette base or erm  a reel to reel?
No, I said he wants to buy one.
I think he wants to buy one.
Pete, who's Pete?
My ex-boyfriend who's been helping .
Pete the strange, the strange, well   
I don't remem 
boy.
I don't remember Pete.
Yes, you do, Peter!
Peter?
Oh right!
Yeah, yeah!
After Jonathan.
The one who was in erm  good lord!
I can't keep track!
What the one who's er  off round the world and  oil rigs or something.
yeah.
Yeah.
Is he going back?
Oh yeah!
I gotta take him some letters.
Have you?
Well he's been helping me with things.
Is he a musician then?
Well he plays quite a bit of guitar.
Yeah?
And he wants to know where he can buy them in Ipswich.
Oh oh!
And that's why he's not at home.
So
There's quite a lot of second hand if he's willing to travel around for them.
Yeah.
Depends what he wants.
But I mean er  you can get cassette based ones which are quite cheap  and cheap to run  cos you just use, you know, good quality  metal tapes  and you get four tracks  I think they even make a six track one now, or an eight track.
He only wants four.
Erm  
Er  Norwich Road.
Well Marky I thought I'd just be practical and ask you, it's quarter one to , quarter to eleven you go and collect Sue.
Cor I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to go soon!
Yeah.
Yes.
Now listen
Yeah.
and how long are intending to stay so we can  I'm still not here?
Well, the surgery's at half  eleven till half twelve so  we pop back here for a quick cup of tea and I want to go up to Felixstowe.
Mm.
Cos Charlie, you know, keeps digging rabbits up and he's knackered his claw!
Oh right.
So, you'll just have a cup of tea with a nice piece of chocolate cake?
Cor yeah!
Sounds good!
And then afterwards Isobel and I could go to Sainsbury's  that's the whole idea.
And er 
Oh right.
you are very welcome to stay for lunch but you say you can't.
You stay with father and mother don't you?
I thought you go out tonight?
Yeah, well we would stay but the, the surgery's only an hour you see, that's the trouble.
Yeah but with her father and mother?
Oh yeah!
Go  go after that?
Mm.
Probably , mm?
Well, Sue's hurt her shoulder cos she was carrying her bag on the train you know  coming back from Birmingham.
Was it too heavy then?
Well, women they must  pack the whole wardrobe don't they?
Mm.
So how's her shoulder, well a bit of heat and shoulder massage it would help.
Right, have a massage, yeah.
Yeah.
you better go otherwise she will be annoyed!
Standing there, you said quarter to eleven!
Did I?
Oh, yeah well  better her standing than me really!
Cos the car's bigger.
Yeah.
Erm
Where is it then?
Yeah, and you can't park.
Colourful boy isn't he, ha?
?
Did you say?
, on the Norwich Road, might be one.
?
!
in Norwich.
Yes.
Keyboards.
And there's  they might do the machine.
But the  mainly keyboards but   's your best bet.
.
They do quite a lot of stuff in there.
They'll definitely have something.
in Norwich.
Waste of money though.
Is it?
Well he's got thirteen hundred.
Better give me some then!
Yeah.
I'll sell him my machine for five hundred quid.
Did you  don't you want to sell it then?
Well it's a bloody great thing innit?
Well
Half inch tapes  at twenty five pound a reel  for the tape.
Whereas cassette 
 
you can, you know 
Did you want to keep it?
Oh yeah!
Right.
Yeah.
Righto, I'll be off in a bit then! 
How long was I then?
Fifty five!
Oh give me a break!
Darling you were!
Yeah well I didn't wanna have to sit here waiting for you, cos I know you every time you say oh so and so
Yeah, alright 
I mean 
okay!
as far as I was concerned you might have been in there another  fifteen minutes!
Anyway I got chitter-chattering with mum and dad.
Must chuck the dogs in the shed for a bit.
Yeah, give them plenty of room.
As the frame came down and Bunny, came out and Bunny was sitting in the driver's seat again!
Pest!
Anyway I've put it on Access so that that helped!
Oh don't worry we'll get out of it.
They spotted the mike straight away you know!
Did they?
So I'm never gonna get away with it at work am I?
No, you're not, you mus , oh don't!
Oh no, what I mean is  I'm not gonna be able to get away without people 
No 
knowing
cos it'll make them think about their language won't they?
A bloody good job!
Do I wanna go this way or go up round?
Go any way you want to go.
So, what do you reckon?
Haven't had a chance to look yet.
I'm just trying to get past these cars.
I'll tell you  I'm going back to Lucy next time, she's, she's alright Vivien but she hasn't got it like Lucy, she's not as particular.
No don't!
Well that's why  Lucy's so
Yeah, I know, well I'll book two weeks in advance.
busy.
That's right.
They only a pay a quid more for Lucy, so I'm bloody well gonna have Lucy!
Anyway, it's cut but it's not .
Oh  oh well done anyway.
Oh well we can go for a cup of tea now, I need some breakfast I'm starving!
Mum's making a cup of tea and  a nice piece of chocolate cake.
Oh brilliant!
I need more than that I'm starving!
Anyway, give us a kiss.
Your cheeks are cold again.
I had about two inches cut off actually.
Well, it's a lot better than 
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah, it's got a little fringe on there!
Yeah, well it's a lot better length, you know, it was too long and it's  much nicer this length, much more manageable I found.
It desperately needed a cut though, it was really irritating me!
Bloody building's a real eyesore isn't it?
Jesus!
Disgusting!
It really irritates me!
I can just imagine what it's gonna look like in a few years when it gets 
So can I.
dirty, you know.
Rough!
Ugh!
Don't!
Never mind   won't change when I put it up, so, that's all I care about really.
Well it's not all I care about but 
You said that so so damned !
No one 's gonna build anything.
I know.
Good!
Oh, I know what Pam didn't bring, she was saying ooh you know  apparently they've  shut up all the entrances, the gaps in the fences cos they want to encourage  erm  wildlife to be on the back, on the mere an and not dogs and that!
So she said, you know, they were   
They fenced what?
They, you know, at the back of us they've  blocked up the fences but I don't know whether she's got it right, I don't know.
I said well Scott, you know, said that if  you know, we ever take our dogs on there  he erm  would give us a ring  and he hasn't.
Or we would know, you know.
Yeah.
So I hope they're not gonna say we don't want you on there cos of wildlife stuff.
Oh shit!
Yeah, but he doesn't own the bit behind us does he?
Course he does!
Ah, no I mean the  I thought you meant the bit beyond the field.
There's not really wildlife in  it's just a back grass area!
Well I know.
So what what 
Unless it's long, you won't get anything in there.
what Bonnie was saying was erm  don't you mean the common area bit, you know, the bit at the back?
She didn't seem to know, I thought well I'm not really 
No.
worried about it I'm sure!
And if he is doing that I don't think he'll mind us going on there cos the other dogs that have started walking on there, do you know what I mean?
Can't really stop that 
Well I haven't 
much.
Well I haven't many  really.
But if you walk through there I bet you haven't boarded those .
I mean 
No.
Sally was talking about it.
Yeah, well she should of, she should 
she's a bit 
have had that.
Yeah I know.
And she ooh you know I've spoken to Scott and asked him.
And I thought yeah I know mate, you might of now but you bloody well hadn't a year ago well I said well  so I said before we even put the on the field once we'd phoned him up asked.
Alright, alright she said.
And I bloody well know that when we  you know, first moved there and we're in the caravan she hadn't asked him and they'd already been there eighteen months!
Felt guilty as hell the first time I went on there!
Yeah, but you did have permission.
Well that's me all over isn't it?
Yeah but we had permission.
Not for the first time.
We did!
No, it was the day we went to get Bunny I think wasn't it?
The day you went to get Bunny and I had terrible hay fever.
Oh yeah, on the common land.
That common land doesn't belong to Scott though.
That belongs to that other git!
Yeah.
Er
Before we went on Scott's land we had permission.
Right, come on then!
Ding dong!
What's this for?
Oh it's quite good, to stop people tripping over.
Cos 
Oh!
you thi , you look at it, you stand here in poor light  it just looks like the stain's continued through.
Yeah, true.
So you try and put those on.
It's a good idea really.
Mm.
Dee dee dee dee dee dee .
Come on then!
Hello!
Hello!
Back again!
Hello!

Yeah.
Hello!
Are you alright?
Good morning.
I've put the kettle on for you.
Ooh yes please!
And a nice chunk of chocolate gunk!
She's she's cut it well.
She hasn't cut it badly Barbara, she's not, she's not as good as Lucy.
And I think it's  I said to her when she was cutting it, I said look you know one side's longer than the other  and er 
 
she re-cut it  and er  I still think it is, slightly  when you have that 
Let's have a look.
turned under a bit more.
 
No, it's that side.
Isn't he?
No, you look alright.
It's much softer than it was.
Yeah, well the  you move your head around so it's 
You've got that cut 
just difficult to sort of analyze.
I know, but it's better  it was too straggly.
Got this sort of silky look 
 
hasn't she, now?
Marky!
Oh thank you very much.
Yes.
Piece of er  chocolate cake, Sue?
Yes please, and he's starving!
We didn't have a chance for breakfast this morning.

Oh, is that one that's left.
Yeah, I'll eat another one.
You want to get  off.

Yep, you can have banana.

So, oh

Where do you want this?
It's all, it's all very interesting actually and erm  so she did .
Gotta get, I'll find er probably needs rebuilt.
Talking on the subject and then it's, they're talking about  genetics and things .
Oh, it's all the
Can you keep up with it?
Well  it
you can?
Well, yes and no really, it's all  related to D N A and cell division and they're really getting into  different sorts now of how cancer is occurring.
 
It's really very interesting!
Oh!
Do you have to study at night then?
Yeah, I have been cos I've been bored really so all I do is study.
And read books.
Look at the colours you got in that!
John you got smoke 
Yeah !

But erm
Mm, that's just coming off the doors.
Yeah I've got to do a project, I'm gonna do a teaching package at work and
See, that's gonna burn off

Oh I see you  it's a tarred all with the fronts of 
Yeah, tarred

Yeah, just a bit you see, else, because of wood  
Oh blimey!
Makes a lot of mess dunnit?
Yeah.
Mm.
So they  what would that be  
Yeah but that's the old tree, that came down 
Yeah.
years ago!
Well, yeah 
Yeah.
That'll be all dried out by now.
 
Well it is dry but it's still 
 
full of resin innit?
I mean it does make smoke er  maybe .
Is that ?
Well it's cheaper.
So er  so I
I remember I had to do one once, ear, nose and throat and everything and you're explaining to them where the  the erm  adenoid and tonsil and tissue was and oh my god talk about
Mind you, I mean  it must be 
They were up the level  that I was 
some woman  that have  but perhaps they've required so much more knowledge in the  
Well it might be.
that you, you notice it more.
Yeah.
Right.
But  but no, you used to think they're doing, you're doing a good service aren't you?
Mm.
I mean not all of them are like it but
No.
but, but some of them, you know.
Yeah, a bit irritating!
But er
What's  wandle 
 Wandle 
They're not all of them are that committed 
Oh  wandle 
to listen .
 Wandle 
  
What the hell's  wandle 
Oh!
Did you find it very depressing?
Erm  no, not really everything 
I'm getting really paranoid about the smoke coming in the room!
he said that  totally run of the place .
Have you bought a new set John?
You used to have 
I mean 
wooden ones.
They did it in X-ray ward and 
No.
quite  cos he  it's nothing much at all 
this is the one .
They kept their coats for for .
They get a lot of use and play all the time.
But erm  no it's alright.
Oh!
So, were th were they  different?
Quite a successful game really isn't 
Erm 
it?
they're not necessarily   
You wouldn't mind the royalties for that anyway!
.
Look at that it fits it perfectly!
And we have a lot of experience.
The other co , other things come and go but 
It's now up to them.
Scrabble goes on forever.
You know, it's like Heinz beans!
And erm 
And it, I went to Birmin , Birmingham Children's Hospital  
I eat, oh where you going?
Oh  !
and it was very  to actually go to a children's 
Two.
ward
Yeah.
and actually see   
Shit!
and the way you got   but er  they  you know.
You know, it's alright in our manager levels but if you go higher than that then I mean they're just useless!
Mhm.
Waste of space really compared with a , paediatrics cos they er  hey haven't got the forethought or the .
Mm.
You know what I mean?
Whereas you  I mean it's great you go into Birmingham Children's Hospital and it's red and blue and green and balloons and it was great!
And, and we've just had our walls repainted and I furious with  with erm  Rita  cos all she we , all she got was these bloody pastel colours  I tell you if I was  
Ah for kids?
out for blood!
The place is , red and blue and greens.
They're they're alright for mature adults aren't they?
Eh?
They're alright for mature adults but pastel shades are too 
They're boring!
boring for children aren't they?
You know I mean 
kids like a bit of colour and 
that's right!
and Mickey mice  and mouses or 
That's it!
whatever you call it?
I mean we've got all that, you know 
Mm.
but we're not allowed to put posters on the walls you know, it's better for them to stick them at 
Mm.
or something.
Why not?
Are they worried about  destroying the 
Well no well 
paint?
Well use 
Well 
Blu-tac or something can't you?
That's right!
Well no you'd be amazed what they do, if you leave Blu Blu- tac up for a while how  it actually takes 
Yeah, marks or 
the paint as well 
Yeah.
.
And erm  their consultant he really annoys me he erm
The silly part about it though 
he's one of these 
they should have panels Sue, in a children's ward!
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, but we do 
You know 
have panels John but then 
long, long plain pieces of area you could 
Yeah.
easily, you have to put roller over, you know, a quick 
That's right.
job and use that for poster area and not touch the rest.
But you'd be amazed actually the few small bits  areas there are, cos they put the, well the nice thing is it's a light building and there's loads of windows everywhere
Yeah.
and there aren't big stretches of wall.
I mean 
Mm.
I said to Cathy, look, why don't we get the polytechnic to erm, do a mirage?
I think she thought I was mad!
And I said, look, get them to do a section of mirage and then it up on the ceiling
Mm.
all the way across.
Well can't they paint it straight on in the mi , on the ceiling?
No.
Sistine Chapel job!
You're joking!
Yeah.
Well like, remember that programme we saw when they  they did that thing for the kiddies' hospital didn't they?
That's right.
Er Anneka Rice thing 
I might have a go actually see who I can get to do it.
and she erm  they got these 
What is it?
people in to paint all the corridors, this place was really dowdy wasn't it?
Yeah.

on er  Open University about er  er these er drugs designed to  you know  er well 
Yeah.
a lot of them were  too complicated for me to explain to you but I mean I appreciated the  the miracle of it all, like they could actually  take the thing to pieces 
Yeah.
to that extent, you know.

Was the train journey very tiring?
No,no well not really Elly, trouble is I had my bag with me and erm  it's carrying it across the Underground  but it's quite a way across the Underground cos you have go
Back pack  that's what you need, definitely.

Jus 
weeks.
no, just borrow mine.
Mm.
If you want.
But tha that will stop your back ache.
Well I'm just not gonna take as much stuff.
Erm, you have to go from Liverpool Street  on the  Circle Line to  to Moorgate and then get the Northern Line  to  Euston.
I can get another train from there.
And London is still as grotty and as horrible as  I suppose!
Well, I was actually im , very impressed with the Underground cos I do , I haven't been to Euston before and the Underground is really  I mean, it's modern but it's clean and it's actually
And it's smoke-free now isn't it?
loads 
Mhm.
and loads better and th the Underground  
And they keep them a lot cleaner now.
Yeah, that's right.
Cos of fire and things.
Loads better, really looking better.
Oh right!
Well the Charing Cross disaster probably
Yeah, exactly.
kicked somebody's arse!
Mm.
So, it's  it's certainly loads better.
I mean, Birmingham's a dump, but I mean
Mm.
the area where I am  I mean it isn't too bad but it's, it's not brilliant by any means, no.
But I mean the B and B's alright and er  they've paid for me to have an ensuite room  and a  quite reasonable  breakfast so
Right   here.

Well there used to be just me but then they've employed another one  and we were so fed up with being on nights that we said look, I'm afraid we've had enough of this, you know  so she  I said to her how about you allocate us each to a ward you see
I've got to do it for a week haven't I?
So

There's people with dogs down here all the time aren't they?
They've all got little rugs on!
Keep them warm?
Yeah, that's what we use them for  but I'm sure she's   running.
Oh god I wonder if we'll have kids that want ponies  Oh god!
Oh no, no no, no, no, they're not gonna have ponies or football!
If our kids wanna go to the football it'll be  well erm
You can ride ponies but I don't think we could actually afford one.
go and do a paper round and you can go then can't you?
Don't think we can afford to erm  keep ponies.
Got nowhere to put them anyway!
I wouldn't, erm, I wouldn't have er  horses or ponies unless we had
Well you, would you  
couple of acres at least to put them on.
If it came to it you could keep them at the Chestnuts over the road.
Bonnie, come on!
Bon!
And stable them.
We could build a stable, put them at the bottom of the garden   and how expensive the
Stables at the bottom of our garden?
Yeah.
We could always ask Scott  if we could put them on  !
I know, the Chestnut  is over the road.
Chestnut?
Oh what the er  well would they 
Erm 
well I supp 
what is her name?
Oh yeah!
Mandy.
Do you reckon she would er 
yeah.
Oh right!
But, I mean  horses are expensive 
So they're not all her horses then?
No!
No, no, no!
Oh I didn't reali , I thought they were all hers.
No!
She has erm  you know, people keep their horses there.
So what does she do just maintain the stables?
Yeah.

, yeah.
Yeah.
But er, no I don't know I hope not!

A thousand quid!
Cor !
And it looked a nice pony one.
A thousand quid, you've gotta be joking!
They nick your car away.
Well if the steering lock's not on obviously quite easily.
Yeah but  if the key's not in there  and you turn the wheel it locks in straight away anyway!
Yeah, that's true.
Or you could do an Arnold Schwarzenegger, just go   break the lock!
Yeah, the trouble with the steering lock is the same   Ford or an Astra.
Possibly.
I'm in fifth gear  give it some welly!

Different.
we're gonna finish the wallpapering
Oh that's right, all double  and thing.
Very nice Spencer!
Yeah.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Cor, what a difference eh?
This looks totally different dunnit?
If that bedroom painted  the wall there.
It's difficult choosing wallpaper.
You been out choosing wallpaper?
Well what does it matter!
Yeah, there's nothing about these days is there?
Yeah you couldn't do it.
That's why  I like but
That's one of the reasons we didn't bother we just painted it, you know?
Yeah.
Cos it's a pain hanging it!
Well we were gonna  really but  you know,
Well we're gonna stuff like 
Nice though.
this on the floor
I really
should be interesting shouldn't it?
Is this  painted wood?
They're either very, very, very poor or
I think so.
so they're
Or is it er
very sort of 
Or is it?
striking pattern  
You tell me what 
Fibreglass, or something like that.
Oh I think it's fibre whatever it is.
No, that's wood, the doors 
Is it?
Oh!
the cupboards and everything are wood but the only thing that's  the  compressed card are these
Yeah, pelmet things.
 
Yeah.
Mm!
Yeah, it's nice!
Oh it's nice and clean isn't it?
Clean.
Yeah, this has come up nicely now.
?
Yeah.
And that goes right through to that one doesn't it?
Mm.
Yeah, not bad at all.
It needs a good er  good dust.
There is, there's work  all the oil was in here I I I would imagine, yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we got erm nice  windows which were nice 
They were all made up as a batch weren't they?
actually.
Mm.
Yep.
Mm.
Well, well honestly I'm quite pleased with them cos that  I mean  
They look good!
like the grain of the others in there.
What was it like before you moved in then?
A state!
It was all painted, you know, like .
Yeah, but i that was painted like that.
Oh Christ!
We could take that and be stripped this week couldn't we?
Have you put all the  coving up?
Or is that theirs?
No we're gonna do 
Oh!
that.
How, how it had been Mark is  you can see from the floor  here, there was a wall across here
Right.
and then you had like a pantry 
Yes , this was the pantry.
there  er  like a  coal er  this was an outside toilet that you got into round there  and then  the end bit was a  coal  shed.
Oh right!
So  the people knocked all that down, we  we didn't do 
Mm.
that but they've left  like the kitcheny bits here in the  a , what was the old kitchen area
Oh I see 
you know?
yeah.
So what  we've done is like make a   into the kitchen and this will be a .
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Did you have to wallpaper the ceiling or was already 
No.
done?
It was already done.
Oh, it's quite decent actually, I mean it's not too bad.
Mm!
Oh!
It's quite a room, size.
You're gonna put a table here are you?
Yeah.
Oh that's right.
But
Pretty good!
not too bad.
they did chuck in the dishwasher!
Yeah!
That's a little winner of the thing.
Very good!
Save you having to wash up!
And how often do you have to use it then?
 
Every other day we're using it at the moment.
Oh not bad!
Not bad!
But no, he's made a nice good job of the 
Yeah, it's quite popular the old dishwashers now.
tiling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He has hasn't he?
Yeah.
And 
like the th plumbing, you know the  another reason  fix it on, instead of having a drain  for that, a drain for the sink and a drain for this, they all go into one.
Yeah.
Un under there
Mm.
Much better.
and then  out of the side which is  which is nice.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, it's very nice!
So when are you off to Outer Mongolia then?
I'm back to Outer Mongolia tomorrow.
I got back last night toothbrush 
Mm.
is still, still  wet!
!
Had a worried look on her face then !
Oh darling!
Sorry !
Bonnie's face!
Never mind, pet!
Erm 
Where are you going?
Birmingham.
I'm going to 
Birmingham?
Birmingham.
Yeah, on a course.
Oh!
And then I'll be 
That's another week.
back tomorrow  for a week.
Mm.
And then home for five weeks and back for another two weeks.
Oh!
What's at Birmingham 
 
then?
Why do you go to Birmingham?
Oh it's erm  they've got a, I mean it's a huge hospital!and 
Mm.
they've got a children's hospital there  and I'm doing a paediatric health course for a month.
Oh right.
So children with leukaemia and  
All  
yeah?
Mm mm.
Whatever!
Mm.
It's all good stuff!
Can't be a lot of fun though can it?
Erm  well i it can be quite nice cos you  okay, you we you're speaking to parents and that who've had kids that have gone and died   you're not actually dealing with the kids themselves.
Oh, so it's like dying and coming back!
It's all the theory of it and erm  hi-tech stuff.
But then  what, are there people that are jus that are already qualified in that or ?
No, no I'm the first one to go in.
So at the moment, if you've got a  kid with cancer they can't go to Ipswich  or is it just a .
No, they do but we share the care with Addenbrooks  and  and er  I mean, the leukaemias do but some of the other kids don't .
Look like you was just about to say something then!
 
 
You're just too big!
So you're looking after Gary Lineker's little boy are you?
No, no, no, no, no  that one  that one's  
He had to have .
I dunno, he's got a rare form of cancer but  .
Mm, so  I'm very impressed!
Can we go out in the garden do you think?is that alright?
It was blocking 
It's open.
the door last time weren't they?
It's open.
Let's hope you should  see my   before.
Yeah , I didn't see it before.
It was a lovely green kitchen!
Green?
Green!
Sort of a 
Ugh!
lime green wasn't it?
Oh!
Mustard green?
No.
Well the front here  this is green  going up the front isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, you get the effects from that don't you?
Yeah.
It was green and yellow really, actually er 
It was a sickly green wasn't it?
in er  , green and yellow.
What you gonna do with the garden then?
Erm, the idea is  we're gonna have that block  all we're gonna do is make er  this is very ambitious plan here  erm  we're gonna have  the problem with the drive at the moment is if you put one car in it's always the car 
Mm.
in front that you want 
Mm.
out first!
I like your car by 
Yeah.
the way.
  

parked do you think!
Hey?
The erm  we're gonna, we're gonna make a drive bit that goes in across where the lawn is now
Aha.
so that you can have one car  there and another one up here.
Yeah.
So, it'll be block paving all up here and around there  and down the side there.
So you, are you 
Aha.
gonna have all this taken out?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And do that  do that.
So you're gonna have, you're gonna have  get rid of the lawn at the front then  effectively?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And pave right over to the  gate there so you, so that you can get either car out    one one car   and bring up to the back of here and the other two  across there .
And then, coming through here  take it all the way up    take this garage down  and bring the lawn across.
Are you gonna put another garage up or  just
No.
won't bother?
No.
I find it's dangerous to be driving your car backwards and forwards across the  back door innit?
You know, the kids?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
So then  you know, you've  you end up with quite a nice er  lawn  oh right!
You take this up?
Yeah,
Yeah.
Oh and these were the gates were they?
That's right,the , they were  they were gates at like the front of the house there.
Oh it's had all new windows put in some time hasn't it?
Mm!
Yeah, all the windows except the  the kitchen of
Yeah.
I I expect like yours, they're hard wood and then er aluminium at the 
Yeah.
side.
Yeah.
No, ours are hard wood solid but
Oh!
you know,
Yeah, yeah.
Pretty good!
Yeah.
Oh you got a little shed!
Got a little shed here.
We got a greenhouse.
And some veggies!
And a sort of
Are these leeks?
things that I don't know what they, yes, I think 
or or 
they are.
bolted onions!
What the hell are they?
Probably er  strawberries.
The bed.
What's that there?
Are they cabbages or something?
Red cabbage.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
These are .
Mm!
Looks good!
Right.
Nothing's growing very well in there.
Yeah, once you get that shed and that garage down you can er
Be a nice size won't it?
be quite 
Yes.
decent, yeah.
Mm.
Have you been watching that gardening programme?
Friday evenings.
No, it worries me!
Oh!
They've had some good ideas though.
It's quite good actually.
Did you see that one  erm with  where  the, really old boy on a scrap yard, like a, and and then it was like a huge park!
No.
No.
He cleaned it up a bit   and a scrap yard and it, and this thing and they were like hills and  rock gardens, you know like 
Oh really!
hundreds of yards  long 
Yeah.
and and deep!
Yeah.
This bloke, you know, had been working on it for fifty years nonstop and 
Oh my god!
Yeah, Sue Sue wants it 
 
o over a weekend don't you?
Just give up!
I can't, I just wanna sort of look out the window and it's changed completely!
Not asking a lot now is it?
Oh it's great!
Ah!
the old boy .
Yeah.
Ah yeah.
Yeah.
And they build up the old .
Yeah and you don't even notice it do you?
So these cupboards have gotta go on here but the door's gotta go up in the meantime?
Yep.
Yep.
Oh right.
,.
We've still  we've still got a little bit of fiddling 
Oh I see 
to do with the  what the  well  we've got  instead of all these individual prints I've got  I've got long ones cos if the 
Yeah.
floor is
Mm.
very uneven.
I'm gonna fit them.
But until you finish the  your messing around you're better to leave the doors off aren't you?
What you gonna do on the floor?
Well we're looking at  we were having a look this morning at erm  that vinyl floor covering stuff
Mm.
Mm.
would be best.
Do you want to see if there's some wallpaper in here Mark?
!
No!
It's er that that we're particularly
Ah that's er lovely 
keen on.
isn't it?
Yeah!
Got a real sort of er 
But it's gonna be difficult to decorate 
 
around it, you know, and keep it intact but  we'll  we'll try it.
That's amazing isn't it ?
How people 
Yeah.
with chi , er tastes are different?
Are you gonna keep this, keep this as well are you?
I'm sure it was  at one time.
Gotta be, but
carpet, I mean that was !
Yeah.
I think the door's nice though!
The thing about this is , it's gonna be a nice room isn't it, when the
Well quite!
Yeah.
you know, the garden is done.
Got a decent so you're gonna have this as a dining room are you?
Well I  I  I don't know.
Well that might just be  you know, like another sitting room
It's 
Yeah.
tasteful innit?
so 
Yeah I mean 
 
Yeah I 
Lovely!
mean
Yeah, don't don't, try not to damage any more of it, I mean 
No , no I really think of that.
Are you gonna be able to get some more from the manufacturer to 
 
to patch that bit up are you?
Patch that together, yeah!
.
Yeah!
And we'll have another fire in here.
What was that, an old 
Yeah and a 
gas fire thingy was it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
If we could get a  you know, if we could open that up  cos we got one of tho th , have you seen the fire in action?
In the lounge?
Yeah 
Yeah.
I like it.
Yeah , yeah got a glimpse 
Yeah.
of that.
I like it.
Oh .
Oh it is, and we put, light the fires  
Nice and warm.
as well.
Yes, it is nice and warm actually but  
That's actually gas isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, Derek was saying about it.
Gives off quite a lot of heat.
And  I think they're quite expensive to run but  it was so nice we
We got rid of that one.
we thought we'd try it out.
Well the new one was  the new one was  we looked at one in the gas
showroom when this 
Alright!
thing came out
Mm.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Mm.
You're not tape to taping are you ?
No I'm not actually 
 
I've rewound it once.
 
Can't work out how Mark, we'd like to but we can't 
 
work out how!
Well you just shove one aerial output th the aerial input on the other one I think.
Mm.
Or video, no, video
No I like it, this one's nice 
output to video input.
I like this.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's nice that!
You've got 
It's convenient isn't it?
That's right, very
Switch it on and
you can 
 
What's that?
The thermostat, I'm just wondering how it works 
Yeah, we know about the thermostats.
cos there's another thermostat on the  on the boiler itself.
Tell me the difference between a volt meter and an amp meter?
Well one measures volts and one measures amps!
What's the difference between a volt and an amp?
The volt is the amount of current passing through
Yeah.
yeah?
An amp  amps is current, and volts is  volts !
Well basically  with a  with a volt meter 
Volt 
Right?
you put the  the volt meter across  the  voltage you're measuring  say, like a battery, right 
Right.
got a battery, put the volt 
Right.
across it 
Yeah.
and you measure volts, okay?
Yeah, they're fine  
That tells you how much,wha what sort of voltage battery you need does it?
Well that tells you the voltage of the battery  at that particular 
That you're using?
time, yeah?
I understand.
Right.
So 
But 
an amp meter
amp meter you put in series  say, like if you put a light bulb across 
Right.
the battery  you put one lead on the battery for the light bulb and then  the other 
The other one
lead of the bulb would go  through 
through 
the meter.
Right, to the 
Does that ma 
bulb?
So it'd go  from the, from the battery 
And Mark's gone past!
Are we there?
Are we there?
Are we there?
And
 
If we go from the battery to the bulb , from the bulb to the meter 
To the amp meter, from the meter to the battery 
from the meter to the battery , yeah.
Right.
And what does that do?
And that measures current.
And that measures the amount of current flow to 
, when did you pick it up?
Oh!
Well we had it, got it last night.
Did you?
Yeah.
Why's that then?
Is that something you're teaching the kids are you?
We are we we've got an amp meter and a volt meter and I thought they were the same thing you see.
No.
You've gotta be a bit careful cos if you stick an amp meter  or a current meter across a battery  you're effectively shorting the battery out.
Right.
Right?
Cos you've effectively got a dead short through an ammeter whereas a  a volt meter's got a  a hun , a high er  resistance or an open circuit, effectively.
Right.
So if I put a volt meter on a battery it would short the battery?
That's what you said isn't 
No.
it?
Amp meter across the battery.
If you put an amp meter across a battery?
Yeah.
But the current would flow wouldn't it?
Yeah, the current would flow
Yeah.
but you would get a lot of current flowing.
Depends what the  what the a , I mean if you've got an ammeter set to milliamps  and you stuck it across a battery
Right.
the meter would go smack across the thing!
Right.
But if you have it set to to amps
Amps.
then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of .
But the first time he's hitting it
See what I mean?
it bloody  hard !
 
So you've gotta be a bit careful!
Well why on earth would a school have an 
And 
amp meter for?
all these buttons like the  normal  
I mean, I understand why a volt me , you know, I mean, but I mean, battery's have 
?
has a voltage 
 
written on 
.
anyway!
I mean, so what do you want a 
Yeah.
volt meter for?
Well when they 
I'm going to look at  being funny.
Yeah.
Oh I'll be out in a minute.
Erm  if you  the thing is,yo a battery might be marked nine volts
Right.
but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts.
Left?
Well if it's dead, it's dead isn't it?
Yeah, well it's dead yeah but  what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever  got  it's operating and stops working.
Know what I mean?
So if it, if it's got six volts left, it wouldn't be dead would it?
It would just be
Yeah, it'd be dead.
Would it?
Yeah.
Right.
So what's the point of having a volt meter then?
Just to find out what voltage you got left in your battery?
Well no, your volt me , I use volt meters all the time at work.
You make, build a circuit  if you 
Right 
wanna test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure  cos if you think 
So the power is going round?
No, that's 
Well they 
an amp meter!
You just wanna measure the volt, it's just a test meter isn't it?
I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work  and you just turn a knob and it's got  ohms, volts, amps  frequency  you know, whatever.
And they get them on one machine?
Yeah.
I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it.
Right.
See what I mean.
Oh well at least I know that there is a, a different thing.
It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand
I don't know ohms law.
what's what.
No.
I mean I think  really  new, newfangled things!
It's really not this .
Oh it came yesterday did it?
Oh she's sitting in it already.
I don't know, he's got the key but he's not gonna get in.
Oh.
Yeah.
I'll have a quick shake, shufty.
It's very nice.
Well the si , the back door's open innit?
Oh is it?
Yeah, so you can close it.
Station please!
Cor this is nice innit?
First time 
Underneath 
I've been in one of these.
underneath there that's your miles per gallon  so as you're  driving along
Yeah.
that tells you  you know, how  how you're driving it  and onto 
Oh right!
economy
Yeah, yeah, got you!
er   been quite good in that one.
Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes   smack !
That's right.
Yeah.
There's your lights.
Side lights.
And what's, is this beam?
No, that's er the  rear fog light
Oh right!
and those are  you know
The beam would be on a stick wouldn't it?
Yeah.
It's on one of the sticks.
Yeah.
Yeah erm
Oh it's nice 
 
isn't it?
Electric windows if we go out later.
Oh, sun roof as well.
Oh yeah  
You can er  adjust the lights, say that Mark's got in the back
Yeah.
put that on one
Oh right, why?
cos there's somebody in the back  and that's 
Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle 
 
of the lights.
Oh right.
It changes the two
Yeah, mm mm.
erm and then you can control the  density of the other lights.
And they go down at  a bit at a time  or  it'll go all the way down .
Mm!
Nifty, what?
This is your  mhm!
Oh my god!
like that.
Is that for the mirrors?
Yeah.
Oh god!
That's  
 
Do you wanna drive?
Take it for a little drive.
No, probably an !
I mean no,
I wouldn't !
I'd take any other cars!
No I wouldn't !
 
In any other car, I'd say it was no.
Well you took your dad out didn't you?
I know, but  bit different.
Honestly!
The steering lock on?
If you were to come back there
Oh!
all the wa , all the way
starting up car
We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow!
No, I wouldn't want   .
How long have you been waiting for this car, a while haven't you Spen?
Erm
Got a huge accelerator pedal innit?
Just like it covers the whole of 
January.
your foot!
January we bought
January, February, March, mm, that's not bad actually.
So incredibly quiet!
A lovely sound isn't it?
Erm 
Mm , too right!
How many valves has it got?
Got sixteen valves has it?
Yeah, no , twenty six.
Four cylinders  four 
Oh.
.
Even  even with ashtray
Yeah.
Ah !
Ah no !
Oh that's sickly isn't it?
That is really smart innit?
Ah that's brilliant!
How does that work then?
They probably have a big 
No idea.
whole department working on these ashtrays  and then  
Yeah, I would of thought  eighteen German engineers just 
Yeah.
on working the ashtray .
That fascinates me!
Oh that's brilliant that !
No I like the light because like, as soon as as soon as you put your key  in the door
Yeah.
the light comes on, and then it waits until you start the engine  until it goes off
Yeah.
and then when you get out  as soon as, as soon as the car comes to rest the light comes on
Yeah.
and then it  stays on until you've closed the door and locked it, you know
Yeah.
then it goes out.
No, there's all sorts of remote  to adjust yo you think you're gonna set the clock so you have a little knob 
Yeah.
don't you?
But you don't, you've got a button to erm  and you just put that .
Oh god!
I'm surprised it hasn't got a digital one actually.
No.
I don't like digital clocks
No.
I'd rather have it like that.
For actually glancing down and looking at a clock
It's nice.
a 
Mm.
dial one is is actually easier to read isn't it?
Well 
What's sa what's the hi-fi like then?
Mark .
Not bad really.
Just do one more  when we've listened to it.
The radio's pretty good.
And the aerial is in  is those two strips on the window.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Rather than an aerial.
Vandal-proof job 
Yeah.
you see.
Good for vandals, yeah.
There is is like a break, this vandal-proof thing, if you park in a  duff area
Yeah.
You pull them  thing out do you.
Yeah.
You can
Oh yeah, take it 
Take your 
out.
radio out and and lock it in the glove box.
And they give you  you get four keys  and one of them is called the chauffeur's key
Yeah.
and that will drive the car but it won't unlock the glove box or the boot
Yeah, for the chauffeur.
so if you do , you don't want your chauffeur to know what you've got in the glove box 
A chauffeur key !
That's your job then Sue!
I like these seatbelts at the back!
They come from the other way 
Yeah, it's amazing!
don't they?
They go the other way to normal.
Yeah.
That's good actually.
They say that's  so that if there's an accident
They can just get out innit?
then people can er  get you out easier.
Oh course 
Yeah.
yeah!
Never thought of that.
A lot of design's gone into that.
Good old Gerries 
 
ah?
Yeah.
But it's not 
Yeah but this one did as well.
Yeah.
These floor mats  see they've got little screw in  things.
Oh, what's the idea?
Just twist the lock and they   
Mm!
It's a bizarre amount of detail but 
It's got a lovely , lovely gear box hasn't it?
Mm.
Gear stick on that.
Yeah.
Nice little chunky one.
Yeah, it's very nice!
The Germans have certainly got it haven't they?
But i , Mark you look at this accelerator pedal  it's the whole sort of length of your foot, it's 
Mm.
so comfortable instead of 
Mm.
that piddling bit that goes in the ball of your foot.
And you find  you see you've got that little thing to put your clutch foot on as well.
That, next to you.
Is there?
Oh 
No.
god!
No, go to 
 
the left.
Oh I see what you mean.
And there's a little 
Yeah, yeah a little 
they've even put that.
They're so  Yeah, well it's all for comfort I think.
Yeah.
They're amazing aren't they?
How fast will it go then Spence, I'm sure you  wound it up?
No, you mustn't take it over 
They've tested it at a hundred and thirty five miles  done, eh?
You ge yo you mustn't take it over  er, three and a half things or  eighty miles an hour 
Mm.
for the first six hundred miles.
Mm.
But the top 
Oh course, yeah!
speed in the book is a hundred and twenty nine.
Oh cos you only got it yesterday didn't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
I don't think we'll  get anywhere near a hundred and twenty nine in that !
It's not that so much though, it's just a luxury and the  the quietness of the engine and everything 
Mm.
isn't it?
Mm.
And 
Er 
acceleration I suppose.
Yeah, it's very good  it's very good like  between forty to seventy, you know, for actual 
Mm.
pulling away from lights or whatever it's  not, nothing very special.
The thing is when you're doing 
No, but I mean 
but when you're doing  fifty  and you wanna overtake something  
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's when it's very tight.
It's very nice!
Let's go and see my sis!
Yeah, very impressive isn't it?
Got a nice  sound to it as well, when you're  when you're not speaking.
 
Mm.
Little
But it only works 
the horns.
with the erm  the ignition does it?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

Alright?

To be honest, I didn't know what you were really    
It's lovely!

Is that the new one?
Yeah.
Well you'll like th th this, it's very, very well done!
Extremely 
Oh!

Mm.
Yeah, could go next weekend if you want?

He's looks far better, I think he 
 
is a younger .
Checkoff's got a toupee.
You can 
Yeah?
see it.
You know, it moves without his head sort of thing, it moves away!
It really is, I mean you'd die laughing!
This has gotta be the last one though hasn't it?
They say it is.
Yeah.
Well there's loads of pensioner's jokes in some of these , it was really, very good  
 
you know, when 
Is he still admiral?
No, he's the captain.
No, yeah, he's the captain of er  see he got, he got demoted didn't he?
For

Cos he went out of Scott's .
For going into the 
Ah he got, ah he got done for that did he?

All about the Klingon Empire diminishing and what can they do about it?

Crawl in right by the fire can't you?
And he's such a hooligan, you know,he's knackered one of his claws again!
Daft thing about it, but I thought rather than hang on I'll get in there and get  off.
Oh!

He's terrible!
Hello!

Yeah!
Oh yeah, could do, if we try it .
You can just imagine, pull them out!
No!

Well really when I had the same thing , you know,and goes back for a little bit this morning  and er  same sort of thing.
But, you know, it's just when you think oh my god, that's money!
I mean, how much do they cost those pills?
Cor!
Nineteen and a half pounds, I thought they were more than that actually.
God!
but you know, I mean I know it's not .
Mm, it's very nice though,.
The mats had were under six pounds this morning, and I pay only half of that.
Oh you had to buy the mats do you?
Will the company buy them?
No.
Oh.
Well it was seventy six pounds before VAT.
Yeah, but you say that I paid thirty pounds for the Astra, now let's get it in the balance here, you see what I mean, and that sen and then 
Mm.
they've, they're  you know, quality-wise they're double the quality.
Yeah.
Plus they're the German ones and you can say 
Plus more.
I can 
Mm.
that that  
But you'll  don't you with it?
What?
With the car?

Go for B M W every time!

Ah, yeah, but the B M W I'm afraid is, they've got it haven't they?
Oh yeah I I think so too.
I think B M W's are the business really!
We were  
Oh you didn't did he?
Well  not cos we haven't quite got one, a B M W .
No, but a a big four wheel drive thing, you know  it's quite sort of.

Yeah.
They're not that expensive actually are they?
They're cheaper than one of those.
Oh yeah!
Those, you know, the the  really  should of got one, you know it's  , almost a Range Rover.
Mm.
Fo four door  but  there's some problem because it's their  .
Very  
.
Mm.
I just thought it was a bit chunky.
the car.
Oh I would of gone 
The BM  
I would of gone for the four wheel
I do , yeah but
definitely!
I know I wouldn't, I think they've been .
Mm.
Yeah but  trouble is you pray for ra , pray for snow when you've got a four wheel drive car!
God 
Yeah.
snow, look!
Don't really want it.
Yeah.
So mum and dad are alright are they?
Yes, they're fine!
Have they drove 
 
the car?
Yes.
I it's nice you know
I haven't been
no, I dro , I drove that and it's really quite nice but I might
I wish he hadn't of got it cos Sue wants it when he's finished with it.
Oh.
Do you?
Seriously, yeah.
It's a nice
Well have it!
sort of, it's a nice little car to drive actually.
It's got the Renault, the Fuego gearbox, you know.
Mm,.
It's, it is really nippy for a one point four!
Mm.
Erm, and it's, it's all there, it's, you know it's a nice car, it's the nicest car he's had!
Yeah.
And it  you know, good round the cor , really nice little thing to drive, yeah.
Even though 
It would be nice if it .
Oh god yeah!
Oh, you know, he's .
Really ni , I mean you get in there and you feel really comfortable and everything's there  you got a nice radio as well and er  but yeah, it's really very nice!
Much nicer gearbox.
It's a typical sort of Renault floppy gearbox, you know what I mean?
No.
Sort of play about with it and , instead of all boring
Yeah.
I don't like floppy gearboxes.
Oh!
I like a nice a positive !
I like that Fuego gearbox.
Mm.
The same sort of thing as the  like this could go through that.
Mm!
Yep!
Straight on!
Yeah I know , I said I want one .
Mm.
Is he gonna go .
He's now done a hundred and seven thousand, I think, a hundred and eight thousand.
Just about in the ground now innit really?
He won't let you .
It sounds like a diesel engine so .
Yeah but it's erm   
  

Didn't he?
I didn't think , it's not that old.
I've only noticed it  five years, it looks filthy, although it's been in the car wash .
Hasn't it?
Yeah, it's all the  on the roads innit?
Yeah.
But you want a Sierra .
No I don't!
You wanted the Sierra!
You want the four wheel drive but it's not practical!
Oh!
So that's gone!
Mm.
Ho how far have you gotta go over before you  you get a  you'll get a company car at B T?
Er  head a group  or group leader  quite a way.
Most of those have got P H D's.
It's er  it's a bit strange at B T!
And then you only get a popular ghia, it's hardly worth it!
No you don't!
Don't you?
Or do you?
Actually, don't forget  
Yeah, you a Sierra, yeah.
yeah.
no, then you've gotta  your car.
Who?
No 
No.
so th th yeah, but .
Mm.
But,th he is  you know, he is very, very good about it, he would know from  loads of money and he's  and his company could have a one point six  Sierra
Mm.
you know 
Yeah.
you don't think
No.
but er  I think that  they were part of your pay rise one year was it?
Yeah,th they had a new, a re-think.
grading, instead of giving them a pay rise they get
That's right.
And I mean er, you know 
car.
if yo if you're earning that sort of salary, I'm afraid to say, which  you know, the header groups are
Mm.
I mean, to drive round in a one point six basic Sierra, well it's pathetic 
It's pathetic isn't it?
really!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
I mean I just think  
Well, well Mike didn't have one cos he was too tall!
Mm.
And he kept banging his head on the ceiling!
Yeah, I know, it's tall !
So he didn't have one 
 
and ma and my group leader he er  he's already got about nine cars cos he collects them  anyway !
He said, what do I want another bloody car for!
So 
Yeah.
he didn't 
 
have one either.
They get a good deal really don't they?
Well we'll be going to an auction to get like a reasonable car.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll enjoy that.
We shall get, you know, sort of, an E or and F and  
They must, they must be going for rock bottom prices at the moment there!
I saw an E Sierra in the paper for about three thousand that had only done forty thousand  er, an estate.
Mm.
Wasn't a very good, one point eight.
But you can save a 
 
lot going to the auction can't you?
Bit of gamble a though!
Well as long as you don't mind the high mileage cars but if they've been going up and down the motorway all the time 
Not all of them are the high mileage though are they?
.
Yeah, a fleet car.
But never mind!
Well  Mike went to a   we went to the auction at 
Yeah.
to buy   and had very much in the sports car range.
No , they don't, they tend 
Mm.
to be your typical  company 
Company car  
Yeah, yeah.
 
Yeah.
But they shift 
So 
them so quickly don't they?
Mm.
You don't get time to think about it.
Mm.
It's like in 
But then if you, I mean when we went there was that, I mean, okay it was erm  it was a van wasn't it?
But it was a Vauxhall Astra van  but I mean it was E reg and it was three years ago and it went for two thousand quid!
You know, and it's got  
That was in mint condition wasn't it?
 
It was an F, F reg was it?
a van.
No, it was an E reg.
Was it E?
But, if you were buying it at a garage you were probably gonna pay at least four 
Mm.
four and a half.
Mm.
And it was a bargain!
Yeah.
There wasn't a mark on it, but I mean 
Yeah.
Well that's cos it was a van you see.
 
That's right.
But I mean
Well no, but I mean  even so, the the Sierras your gonna get cheaper there.
Well a van for us would be ideal wouldn't it?
I don't want a van!
Well you don't need to have back seats do you?
Especially if there's just two of us.
We could dump the dogs in the back and off you go!
You want a Sierra estate mate if you want to go  knocking about the Lake District with the dogs.
Well it wouldn't matter what you 
 
what you'd 
 
got
the ozone, yeah.
you always want something better don't you?
I mean we went u up to Hunters this morning to get those mats
Mm.

But we're only outputting a single line,so you that's all you can do.
But the open Windows One when it comes up, it comes up square, and it's got open Windows 
It's probably 
open Windows Two version or open Windows Version Two and then something else.
About three lines' worth.
Yeah,
Mm.

So it can be done.
All gone.

Right.
Parked was here, I was going up that way.
That's me by the way.

He was parked, he'd sort of just pulled in there and left his car.
He was over here somewhere .
Door was open, headlights on.
I came up, didn't see his door, went through the gap and  wham, bam.
You could argue that it was it was his right of way..
Why?
He wasn't even in the car.
Yeah I know but  if you look  
I mean if there was no-one in the car and the door was bloody open then  
And the engine was running was it?
Yeah well he shouldn't have he should never have left that engine running cos he wasn't 
Yeah I know.
in there for starters, and he shouldn't have left the door open.
Yes..
Shouldn't leave the engine running if you're not in the car.
What you hit his door did you?
Yeah.
So I closed it for him.
Oi mate you left your  door open.
Door open.
Just imagine if he'd been sitting there with his legs dangling outside .
 

 
So you didn't see the er 
the door open ?
No I didn't s er s I didn't see his door open.
Well I I would say it's his fault.

It sounds a bit dodgy if you've got out the car, left all your lights and stuff on  the bloody door open.
Mm.
In th in the middle of the road.
Yeah.
How long was he gone then?
I dunno.
What was he getting something out the boot or something?

I'll go I'll go and see John.
 

Hang on, hang on.
I've got to go and see him anyway.
Oi 
Yes ?
Yeah I think we're going to have to retract that to be honest.
Get the right layer 
You might try and bring that one through there.
No I've just had  it's not normally a problem with us, but the manufacturer they're using,alright, is shit,and they'll tend to end up 
It's better to put loads of bends in rather than er 
Yeah.
 
Well it is for them.
Normally erm I wouldn't worry too much on the prototype, but this is probably gonna be the production  
So each bi er board isn't individually checked then for shorts?
Yeah.
It's not?
It's not, no.
Well, they should be, but this company are shite.
Mm.
And you can't move that.
Well if we put er a kinky in here 
Yeah, alright.
Yeah.
Trying to see where this one goes that I wanna move  
It er it'd be handy actually if it generated an error when it did that.
Yeah.
Then you could just pinpoint them all  
Arguably it's not it's not really a problem is it?
Not normally no.
Mm.
Mm.
He's such a fast worker  
Been there before mate.
I take it all back.
Been there before.
Yeah, don't believe what your mates tell you, I know.
 

See that one could arguably  Oops.
I like these white D R Cs, they're er
Er actually, er much as I hate to admit it, I think you could be right.
Well they stand out,bang.
 
As soon as something happens, woof you're there.
Oh god, what a cockup.
I've deleted  
No.
It's best not to fuck around with these.
I find I've found that if you if you get it like that just, you know delete it.
No, the  command   Look.
I mean, if you did get one that wasn't forty five and you didn't see it, it wouldn't be a problem for the 
 
manufacturer would it?
I mean er does it just tell it 
Er 
to draw a line from one coordinate to another?
Erm
The pen?
Does it tell it to draw a line from point to another   Yeah.
Well forty five's slightly yes.
Yes, I think it does.
Cos on here you get you get like quanti quantization steps don't you.
If you don't 
Yeah.
you get like a little ladder,
Yeah.
don't you, right?
But you don't actually see that ladder.
Nearly finished.
Yeah, okay.
Is it annoying you?
No.
Oh.
Well this this curve here's got s steps in it but it won't 
Yeah.
be like that.
It l it looks curved.
If you look on this one.
Oh yeah.
It's pretty smooth.
No problem.
No problem, sir.
 

Oh, there's something wrong there.
Yeah, it's not on grid.
What's not on grid then?
No, actually, you want eh, you try it.
Alright, erase it.
No, don't move it.
It looks like that  not on grid.
No no no no.
No.
Delete it.
Sorry?
 

follow the trace,
Yep.
Had that before.
It's weird innit?
Yep.
What else have we got?
That's why it'd be so nice to be able to w save the work area so when 
Yeah.
you go back in,
That's right.
you know your grid and everything's all set as it was.
Especially on Monday mornings.
I find that  incredible that you can't do that.
Oops.
I just turned them on.
Oh, dig it.
 

That's a bit close as well isn't it?
What that?
No that's fine.
It's alright is it?
Mm.
It's only if it goes in and you've got no angle 
Yeah.
there  
yeah.
outside yeah.
 

Mhm.
Look at that .
  

Well it's gotta be fairly close to that pin.
Probably doesn't make any difference.
Then it'll be it'll be even with the other one then won't it?
It's so different isn't it?
Yeah but it's got erm 
Yeah but then you've gotta bend all those tracers haven't you?
I've put it there so that it'll look neat.
I don't see why not.
God Bedge, you are a pedantic bastard.
What's that?
Yeah I know but John's  
anyway.
 
Go to help.
Hit the help and say page  
Don't you wanna see if you can put page numbers 
I don't think so.
I couldn't find anything for  
I wouldn't have thought you'd wanted to, that was the thing.
I know, but
It's cos you're using it for an improper  
 
You see the way it's done a trace there, sometimes it'll 
Yeah.
it'll delete that for you.
Oh, it deleted 
 
half of it.
just check  
Yeah.
You can't transfer into any other.
Mm.
I tried to load it into erm Word and it completely screwed up.
You'll have to move  that one
over here and that there.
That's got well  you can move that and then you can probably move that there.
Well do it how you wanna do it, not how  
I was gonna say, yeah.
It's always a problem.
Bedge is the worst one for that.
Yeah.
You wanna do it like this.
You don't wanna do it like that .
Oh that's weird.
I haven't seen that one before.
when he's not happy he comes and re redesigns it all doesn't he?
Yeah he does doesn't he?
Mm.
That's what I mean about this  bloody thing, that it doesn't it straighten it.
I'm working with bloody amateurs.
Takes one to know one.
you we are.
Bastard .
No you ain't got the  switched on.
boy.
You had it then.
Oh hang on 
Delete it.
That's it.
there.
Er  no.
Ain't too bad is it?
Oh dear .
Now did you get the the couplers  the right way round on the erm  ?
That's a  innit?
Yeah.
 

I've dropped me pencil.
 

That's alright isn't it?
Yeah.
Well there's only sockets going in.
Sockets are bigger than the chips normally so 
No you have to be really careful.
That'll go in there easy.
If it won't go in stick it in at an angle.
No if you if you buy a different make of , some of them stick out further and they foul it.
We've had this problem before.
Mm.
So it's best just to be er on the safe side.
Man of knowledge.
Ha!
What'd we do without this boy, eh Norm?
What?
I said what would we do without this boy?
A lot more than you do with me 
 
probably, yeah.

Cos this week he's gonna be fucking useless.
He'll have a fucking racetrack on there.
He's round every single race circuit, now don't you worry.
Tell you what,
He's  jobbie he's going whizzing round there.

You've got a new bike have you?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well I haven't yet, I haven't picked it up yet.

Fucking hell.
Erm  how do you do it without redoing the thing?
Do you just move 
Now there's a reason why I've got this view up at the moment, alright.
Don't tap the screen, you'll scratch it.
That's what he said to me on Friday 
Right.
 

I'd've been inclined to do that  thing on it.
Yeah.
speeded it up quite a bit.
Do what?
The  thing.
Oh for redraws.
And then change it back afterwards.
Mm.
Right.
If you do  hare whoops, area select, right,
Mhm.
you can pick it up can't you?
Cos you know where it wa where it is now you can just move it.
But the reason I've got this up is because when you do an area select it selects the board outline.
 
So if you if we go move 
You can  
Pick the other one up as well.
And then you put that down where you think is the right place and you get really pissed off cos it's moving really slowly and  moving the board outline as well.
Yeah?
It picks up the board outline.
If you do an area select alright, it picks up the board outline as well, it selects the board outline.
Why?
It's just the way it does.
Cos  
Cos it selects anything that it touches  right and cos it's inside the board outline it thinks it's touching the board outline 
Oh cos the board outline is a filled rectangle?
Yeah.
Ah right.
Right.
So that if you have this view up, you can see whether it's selected or not.
Right?
Oh I get it.
Yeah.
Let me show you let me show you again  
So you then deselect that before you  
Yeah what you do, you area select, right,okay, now if you watch the window  it lights up right,
Yeah.
and then you go point select  
 
and then click here, alright, in open space, and it 
Yeah.
deselects the outline.
And you've also selected half of that chip.
Yeah.
And you just 
Point select  right?
Yeah.
And then you just move  I've moved them two cos   Yeah?
So you're happy.
Why can't you just 
Ecstatic.
point select the er ?
Well yeah.
If you if you do
Well you can, but if it's been unbound then 
Yeah.
it's just a load of lines.
Point select  you've gotta pick that up, you gotta that up and you gotta pick that up.
Or you can select it and then say bind er and then deselect it and then pick it up and move it.
Yeah but what if you're really 
 
good with your area select?
No look, look, look, no.
Area select right, whatever you do   Right area select.
I'll try and pick up  alright.
Really careful with it but  you still pick the outline up cos it's in that area. 
Thing is, it's alright to tell people but they have to s know for themselves to be sure.
Oh what?
You cannot do area select  without selecting the broad outline.
Honest.
That's your project for the rest of the week, is to try and area select  without picking the broad outline up .
I think if you clicked on it and unbound the outline I think you might avoid that.
No that won't select 
Come here, let go.
Let's try something.
I think that whole lot got unbound 
Well no cos they're all
when I when I I area s I 
What happens is right 
selected the whole board and I unbound it.
Yeah you select the whole board.
When you unbind it it just stops it from joining all the bits together.
You then have you would then have to go unbind on the chips to separate the chips again.
?
Yeah.
I reckon  if you decompose the outline  alright?
Mm.
Okay.
So that means if you picked a bit of the outline up now, pick a bit alright,I reckon if you do area select now  select  
Yeah you gotta select the outline then.
That's a  
Right, I think you should get all this stuff written up into a file, a help file.
screen on here is there?
No.
pages.
Doesn't help you very much though, not on this.
Manual's behind you.
I never thought about that you know.
I mean I thought you'd be able to click onto move and hit F one say, and that'd give you a help screen saying to move something, click on it and  move to where you want .
But you know that.
Yeah well it well it'd take up disk space unnecessarily
Mm.
wouldn't it?
Right, you put any text on the outside of the board?
No.
Haven't you got a file  that you dumped down  saying about ?
Well come on then.
Right.
That's what you're here for.
What we gotta do, we gotta 
Got to earn your keep.
    

You're very keen on underscores aren't you?
Yeah, it makes it more readable.
.
Oh, what you that for?
It's got it now.
That's how the old systems used to be with everything didn't they?
    

Hey.
Change all that.
That that needs to be updated.
man, job for you.
He knows.
Was what you were telling him this morning, was it?
Yeah.
Aha.
No you're not supposed to put five in there.
No no no no no.

Yeah.
What's  say?

You haven't got a label on this 
Thing is it remembers the text from the previous one so you can er  just type it in.
It's lovely innit?.
Haven't innit.
Right   You know you were talking about them deleting all er  references?
Yeah.
Have you considered having holes in the ground and  inside the board one on top of the other?
Why?
Well then you can put your reference in there and they can't er erase it.
hold it up to the light  
put me  on the inside.
Oh yeah.
There's no reason why we can't.
Yeah.
Well why don't we do that?
Well  It's only 
Yeah but you were moaning about them taking er all the detail off.
Yeah that's true, yeah.
There's nothing to stop me from putting it   
You could put the  in there as well.
Yeah.
So it'd be like  
Yeah but what they do, they've got all the artwork, so all they do is they go over with a black pen on the artwork.
Oh.
.
It's true.
Oh th so they don't take the files and and  them 
No.
on a machine?
Oh.
Sometimes they do.
So they just shove some tape over it.
That's a bit off isn't it .
Oh dear.
Oh shit, hang on.
Thought I just called that Silk Screen didn't I?
Yeah I was gonna say, what you call it that for?

Doesn't matter really.
Phew it's lucky I'm on the ball isn't it?
It is.

I want it for my two  
Which one do you want?

Dunno why  so  keen on bloody squares.
Is this small one or a big one ?
They will do.
They will do.
Is that for erm ?
No anyone  any 
What a loan book?
Yeah any    .
Oh.
What blood what washing machine you got at home?
Bosch.
Eh?
Bosch.
Bosch.
Tut.
Got this bloody Hotpoint.
Hotpoint.
You get crap machines and you get problems mate.
That's to be expected isn't it?
I usually have er the the German one before about  five year  but the fucking pump  keep on fuck up every other two year.
So when the five year come up I've no longer insurance alright,er I so i c if I change the pump costs about two hundred  so I s so I said  
Is that because it's full of chalk or is it cos 
No it's not    That kind of machine is  is the water is  they they pump the bloody thing up so far,so your  your washing machi your er blah blah bl your  your clothes is so dry.
You what?
Your?
When your washing is when you've finished you you  open the door, is literally er really dry.
You can't see any bloody water.
Yeah.
So that is why the pump got a lot of problem.
We have a brand new one   five year erm insurance, part and labour everything   two two year  we notice the water's not pumping off fast enough so the water's dripping backwards.
Mm.
So we call a guy say oh yeah, he changing th the er  the pump again.
He changing er er the the pump.
When we move in here, we get this guy come along to look at it, he say well  this machine the er the Germans erm   they've really  the pump is th is really easy to go, and so I can change your pump for you but l in your washing machine  washing machine.
I change the pump for you, but that is cost a lot of money.
I said Look, this bloody thing is five years old now,
Mhm.
so anything little something like changing the pump, you know I pay about two hundred pound plus his fucking labour.
Is not worth it.
I can buy a brand new one.
er I want to  want to buy er er  another German one, and then the poxy er spare part 
Yeah but they're er so well made you sh shouldn't really need to have to change it very often.
Yeah but er and also what  I found right,
Ah!
Yeah.
only reason I've got one of these bloody poxy Hotpoint because they can fit right underneath  erm into my kitchen unit.
It doesn't stick out, so I can open the door.
It's not as deep as some others then you mean?
Yeah.
But all the German one is stuck out about what, about inch, so you can't open one the the fucking si side door.
Chop a hole in the back.
In the wall at the back .
And that is a fucking erm   the   a h a hun a thousand spin.
So what?the poxy  dry but   you can if you squeeze it you can get er some water out.
Mm.
They only give you one year labour.
Well they never make things er bombproof do they?
Cos if your washing machine machine lasts for thirty years they'd go out of business  wouldn't they ?
Yeah but they   
Consumer society, you see?
Yeah but the the reason I look at the the poxy Hotpoint because they say well, they guarantee their part for five years, alright?
Mhm.
So I say ah, the the part must be fucking good  If they last five year I'm quite happy.
they last er  for five years.
How long you had this thing then?
I just got it last year.
About a year ago, February last year,ni ninety one.
And it's conked out?
It's not co it's still working, but it's  the you can see the the washing is not as dry as it was before.
Ah.
So it hasn't actually failed, it's just not  up to scratch.
It's not functioning properly.
Yeah but surely that comes under the warranty then.
If it's not doing its job that it's intended to do.
Yeah but they only guarantee what  if part is failure, if the the guy come to look at it they still charge you labour.
Oh.
Oh.
They still charge you labour.
So the parts are free but the labour's a hundred 
 
pound an hour.
I don't know how much the fucking labour is they they charge.
Bloody hell.
labour.
And the poxy 
Well can't you fix it yourself?
Just take the back off and and you've only got to undo a couple of clips and take the pump off.
Yeah I know but er if the pump er 
You're just idle.
if the fucking pump's gone, what the hell am I gonna do?
I'm not buy a pump.
No, you get, well, do you have to have it serviced to get the the free part then?
No, you don't have to.
But if er if you  
Do they only give you free parts  under warranty if it's serviced with a ?
Yeah.
It's a rip-off isn't it?
You don't expect you say look, my pump is gone, give me a new pump  
Well, yeah I do.
It's a 
No.
part.
And they say how can you prove it is the bloody pump is gone?
Well you bl slam it on the counter and say bloody you know, look in there it's got crap in it, it's not working.
I mean I've  opened the washing machine up  I mean literally you can't see fuck all  So  fucking big job to 
Mm.
what what else?
Looks like you've got  pig in a poke mate.
I say no I think I've got a  how er how much  for a labourer.
You've got a water softener as well haven't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
But  the poxy 
So the pump's working but not works properly.
I think so yeah, but I mean
So why can't you take the part  Is it all a sealed unit that you can't get the pump apart?
I don't know.
I mean I 
Mm.
If it was me I'd just take the bloody thing out and have a look at it.
Yeah but  fucking  open it up  kids will be coming   
Lock them in the other room.
No   I try to er to do the erm  I clean my erm  the w er cooker  hob.
hob right  the grease   And I try for I cleaned everything up,

You won't find
Trouble is with this group, nobody gives a fuck.

They're just crappy chairs!
Yes.
Well they were okay and then  just suddenly started doing it.
Runcologist.
Ha!
Let's go in here, see I've locked the screen up so we're laughing.
Makes a change!
Feet off the table!
Do you have to say that ?
Oh you don't put them like that!
Oh yeah.
Put the new hole sizes on the drilling table?
No, that's what I'm saying, true I just did that  used to be a rotary.
Ah, have you lost all the graphics that went around it.
 Doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Yeah.
It's there.
Where's the big table and that on the edge then?
That's in er  in here.
Oh L?
I'd a proper  I had a proper drill, oh you're talking about the new ones?
No.
There was three.
Oh that's right.
Yes.
That's why I was a bit confused  
Oh they should be a drill non-plated, and a drill plated.
Yeah, we got P T H,through hole 
That's cool!
non-plated and drill.
And exactly what I would of said.
What's drill ?
I dunno.
How do you know?
You haven't even thought about it screw head!
Anyway, what can I do?
He always makes out that it's his idea doesn't he?
Oh yeah, I knew that would work!
!
What a bastard!
But  you got a red light there look!
You go on regardless and there's a bloody red light down there!
Yeah, well I  I tried to get rid of it but  it wouldn't go.
Urgh, don't spit on my cheek!
I'm not actually!
Erm  going to graphic centre.
That's right.
There's no room for my share.
Put it away!
What?
Chaps, integrity them toge 
 
Anyone?
Did you get your ?
Sorry?
And have a game of .
Know what I caught on Wednesday night do you?!
Family.
I got .
Yeah, wouldn't be so bad .
Right, solder resist.
Yeah, it was true wasn't it?
Oh sorry!
That's the one I want !
I'm only winding you up!
Na oh yeah go, go through the solder resist go on.
Oh , make your bloody mind up boy!
There.
Right.
Re-draw.
Right when those  blue ridge  tooling holds up  you wanna put a big resistor down there.
Two length holes.
Oh, the things!
I thought that would generate it automatically.
Well it wouldn't.
No.
Why not?
I thought it was from generator to a pipe, couple of hand brakes in there.
Give it here!
It's  it's easy to .
Sure , yeah.
Now, now watch the  burn.
I know.
Come on!
I know!
I will clear it up  post haste.
We need some coffee mats here.
I think I'll 
No you 
pick up a load of beer mats.
you're not supposed to have drinks in the  cad area.
No but  I I let you guys bring in drinks because  most  this system on you wouldn't have a
You're not like old er  misery guts then?
Misery !
Misery !
Alright, control F seven  Ah that fucking, oh he, oh he's ball right into a decent size at last!
Yeah, I changed it.
No, this is still crap!
No it's not!
It is!
It's great!
Had it on A columns that's why   two columns are missing !
Great innit!
Great!
Aha.
Er, you need a solder resist around there  why?
Because, if you'd done  right, the solder resist  they try and put it all over there and it's gonna screw up their manufacturing and stuff.
You don't want it to cover the old hole!
Right?
Screws on the .
Yeah, cos, the solder just li links into the big hole  and you don't want it  cos it can  screw up the size of the hole then.
You don't wanna do it.
Have you got anything on that?
But 
Well I don't know a lo , a great deal about manufacturing which is  a bad thing really.
I need to know the order in which it was  on.
Right.
So you do a little  circly and you have it full  Oh that's clever innit!
See that?
Yeah.
With the to two combined to make it visible.
And at the front.
Oh we'll just stick it  twenty five parallel, alright?
Get it .
Okay?
Good!
It's the wrong colour!
Don't be stupid!
Why's that the wrong colour?
Well you jus 
 
I just don't  siam that's all!
Oh no!
Can you hear what this boy's saying Norman?
Yep!
What a waste of space!
Oh oh, God!
I think I can be excused this week cos thi , the wife's away.
What with no sex?
I used to think through it!
I had sex this morning, it was quite good!
The conventional  missionary !
by now.
 
 
What's the number?
Phone up enquiries will you?
 
Ah dear!
Right.
I suppose you have time in the mornings !
I don't.
That's one of 
Do you walk the dog as well?
reasons I was late this morning, but apart from bloody erm 
Oh course you're on flexitime aren't you?
I wanna be on flexitime.
I might come in  I hate 
You could 
having to get out of bed when I'm knackered!
You could always negotiate it with me Mark.
I'll certainly say no, but there you go!
Never mind ay!
I'll have to negotiate with Frank don't I?
Not you!
You're just a small boy!
No you sho , no, you should do it through me.
No you should do it through Tony actually.
Oh I'll go through you then.
, can I go on flexitime?
Well no, I mean, if you've gotta come in 
I don't see why PA's can't have 
if you wanna come in at nine 
flexitime?
Why, what annoys me out here right, every other  ooh a lot of the  areas are on bloody nine day fortnight.
I mean that'd be brilliant!
That'd be so good!
So you'd work a nine day stretch and then have a load of days off?
Yeah.
Now we have every other Friday off.
It's brilliant!
You can move it !
No I didn't realise  I wasn't sure whether it was there or not.
So would I have to work longer then?
During the week, sort of till ha 
Yeah.
till five?
Well of course they do!
Still have to do thirty seven 
Yeah.
half hours a week!
So you work till five instead of half four and then he knocks off.
Yeah something like that.
Mm.
And he knoc , and you don't work the Friday.
Oh that's good!
It's brilliant!
And then if you have to work the Friday it's overtime!
isn't he?
Oh fuck off you!
Everybody's doing it!
So can I do it?
It's at the back and none at the front.
Yeah that's right.
It's .
Right it's solder resistant.
Mm.
Mm?
What with you and Norman together!
You have a nice hairstyle between you!
Have you seen Colin's?
Ye , actually yes,that's  I wouldn't 
Fucking hell, his, his Mrs did it he said!
and be , and I'm not surprised, looking at it!
Good Lord!
Is is he in here?
No, he's not.
Oh shit!
I was hoping he was gonna be in there.
He's down there.
It's brilliant!
Yeah, I thought he had something strange about him this morning.
I walk in this morning, I'm ever so sorry Colin!
And it took about two minutes to twig what I was going on about !
Oh!
What are you playing with there Norm?
The guy's always playing!
He's changing, changing some   every bloody minute I think, he must change!
He's got  
Well he just have to cycle round, every time you log out his go in a different .
Yeah, I mean, he he tries to stay on random.
No, I wanted  I wanted to scrap er  a pretty one then.
Right.
Ah, I've just remembered something else I've gotta do.
Ooh God !
You're gonna have to move erm  those three chips.
Shall I just crack it then?
I can't get the stroke right.
I think you're a  dick lover anyway!
You liar!
What are you, well it wasn't you actually.
Everybody laughs at Justin.
I'm not surprised.
Gets sma smashing in the fucking  Mercs  oh
Eighty thou is two millimetre isn't it?
He's a slaphead Norman!
Is eighty thou , two millimetre, Norm?
What?
Is eighty 
Norm 
thou , two millimetre?
Yeah, forty thou , one mill .
How come you've got curly hair?
That's looking really curly today.
Don't!
I I can take
That's cos his head's a scrotum, that's not actually a hair!
He's got loads of pubes  growing out !
Yeah, it's a bugger if I'm er  hanging round any velcro!
What are warnings then Mark?
Er  problem with the .
No, it's not found.
Anyway, shall I go and get the bread?
Well only if you're sure you've got everything off there then?
Er  .
That's .
Bollocks.
Oh hang on.
Plated no.
Heads  Were those non-plated?
Did you find they was non-plateds?
Yeah.
You did?
Definitely?
They were non-copper.
No, non-plated's.
Non-plated through when you made the shape.
If you're sure.
Find out in a minute.
Yeah but  I made them non-copper so they wouldn't .
No, that's the pads, non-copper.
How's your pad?
Mm.
I can't remember to be honest.
Have to check it.
Should be a sixteen one.
Ah no wait a minute, it's thick, thick, thick.
Ah !
eighty
and that one's  fifty
You what?
I'm just trying to move passed that I'm making a couple of holes bigger.
These ones.
Oh right.
You happy now Norm?
Yeah, I like that one.
Well you're a bloody fine one to talk  fi , fiddling the back, down there for yonks
Oh it's only Friday afternoon, I was waiting for  Doris to phone me weren't I?
Excuse me.
Did you, did hear Bedge what he actually did on Friday?
No.
Phones him up two minutes past three  I'm gonna try and get the three o'clock train!
From London!
So  said 
Brilliant!
oh I don't think you will.
Couple of minutes later she phones back, er  I missed that one I'll have to get , or the next one!
 
What a corker.
What a corker.
Stupid daft woman!
You wait till I see her!
I'll say to her  any  yeah oh yeah, if we  if we get to the station at five past three do you reckon we'll get the three o'clock train?
Yeah, that's a cracker that!
Just think  get like that 
I said  I said she's bound to phone back in a minute!
And no doubt, the phone rang.
What's the name of the shape?
What shape?
P L C C's
Ha?
With P L C C's.
Oh P L C C  erm
I'll keep going next alright?
with hole, I think.
Don't .
Yeah !
Ha!
That's alright,
But  
Oh, I'm lo , I'm looking for parts here I think.
A O, of .
Or is it one eight six on there?
The ay?
Next one down.
Are we using the one eight eight?
No , no, no, no.
Oh we use the one eight six on it.
Yeah.
How you doing?
With hole!
I thought that was really descriptive.
Oh shit!
Cos these are exactly the same except with a  well and two erm  those four holes missing.
Oh this  you'll be there all day!
Okay, alright.
 Bing 
Plated  no  spot on!
I'm impressed!
What about the forty eight one?
I take it it's   P L C C 
With a hole, yeah.
Ah, wrong one!
Forty eight, forty eight.
No it's forty four.
No it isn't.
That's okay innit?
Excellent stuff!
Splendid!
Right.
So we had to get th the drill table sorted out.
That cancels  yeah but  today, I think don't we?
Oh!
What's next after this then?
Well I've just gotta make sure the drill template's on.
Oh well, once this is done.
Well we're both back onto erm  the wotsit
The piston.
Oh that's quite good.
That's funny, old erm  Colin came in  and you know that one with a  the sort of  screen save and the  the screen shot of that    three- D 
Yeah.
I can't really manage to get a  a .
I said have a go with it.
He sort of think, you know with the balloons on it, so he go he got the mouth part and urgh!
Mr gullible!
Right, if we do a whole list.
Remember VMMT.
VM, MT?
You what?
Have a  to the whole list.
Those are plated through holes.
Ah!
Fifty, sixty?
Ah that's why, fifty doesn't .
VMMT.
V M  M T  V, I reckon.
V or B.
Fifty.
Anyway se these are always named upper case so  it will always be .
Yeah, but you've already got B there for sixty.
Oh yeah!
V W or something.
lum lum la la lum la la lum lum mm .
Oh I know, ah!
Just type in a minute and I'll
Why's that bill still 
Marking information .
Yeah, Bill's got a  an amber light.
That's right, I can't  see anything in
Why's that?
Cos it's not quite built?
Yeah.
What's X?
Right  that one's got the table on  instead of the graphics.
I don't wanna lose that table, cos I don't want to have to write it all again.
Yeah?
Mhm.
So by  
That's a sod that isn't it?
You do a re-drawing, it disappears !
I hate people who do that!
What?
These chair covers!
It's cos they don't sit in the seat properly, they slouch in them!
Make it drag!
Ah er  what's it like living with you then?
Great!
Couldn't be better!
It's alright for me!
Your poor Mrs!
No, she's alright.
It's an area  area select.
Right.
Okay, what we can do, if we  graphics  we bind that alright?
Okay, then we do  points of reference  and then we do  graphics  name symbol, yeah?
Aha.
Yeah I did this 
Well the 
before.
You can save it to er erm 
Simple table.
simple table.
Oops!
Right?
Enough?
Then you can pull it in.
Yeah.
Okay, so  select a   it's a lovely machine!
.
's using the ace.  ace for er  PC's.
And it's quite quick.
Quite good!
Oh you can get it off a pc can you?
Yeah, you can, it's only a  a demo thing at the moment.
It's quite good!
Right!
Doo do doo .
Is it all exactly the same functions then?
Same layout as this.
Slightly different.
Might be a bit different.
It's bit of a migration, it can hardly turn its head.
What about erm  thing?
What's it run on  V G A?
Yeah, it will run on V G A.
Run on E G A as well I think.
Can't be a very good  graphics one.
Well I  run it on mine next.
Can't u , can't use the  right.
Is it the demo you got from  Datatrip 
Yeah.
Right, holeless VMMT  V M M T  WS.
Oh yeah.
Seven inch.
No..
This to come out.
Right, that's all the non-plated ones isn't it?
Alright.
Shit!
What is  doing now?
Yeah,.
The er  sump has gone in it.
Right that's the  the P T H
You're not opening into the file are you?
No I don't need to.
Don't .
And you
Old  with thirty fi , thirty five mill 
Bit like mine is it?
Possibly!
Can't remember 
It 
having a thirty five mill 
it might be in the centre of the  P L C C's.
No, they're big holes ain't they?
Huge!
See they're huge!
Well no, there's a little pad there.
A pad, it's it's not a pad it's an actual hole.
Oh!
Hole with diameter thirty five mill .
Thirty five mill ?
I do , it doesn't ring a bell actually.
Thirty five mill , at all.
Norm !
Yes?
What uses a thirty five thou hole?
Erm
Crystals?
Crystals is about the only thing that would use it.
Can't imagine what's changed it.
Why do you have so many different hole sizes?
I mean surely you could have a point eight for crystal and still solder ?
No, well 
Or is both sided, soldered?
The flow soldered if the hole's too big cos the crystals  is thinner.
Yeah.
It  wicks up through.
Also  erm
It's no problem but 
polystyrene plastics are  are very good  crystals.
Yeah.
We're not using polystyrene anyway.
There's a thirty three in there.
Ah, ha ha !
Uses thirty five mill ?
Wah ah oh oh oh 
 
Oh.
.
It's definitely a thirty five.
.
What would use thirty three Norm ?
Yeah, well it's small..
Yeah.
Erm
He's trying to think.
Must have updated the crystals then?
It's
I think I might have erm  used thirty three on the crystals and now the shape's been updated.
And there's nothing particularly unusual on that.
Crystal's would be erm  one eighths 
And the  veers What about the  veers?
They're quite small.
These are twenty fives aren't they?
These are twenty , yeah.
These are twenty, yeah.
Thirty threes, thirty seven  forty six, so  well thirty threes must be the crystals, thirty fives  I don't see what they're gonna be.
er  sha 
What letter are you er
Oh I'm not worried about the letters at the moment.
Just got it sitting in 
Well 
it's never had that before, I'm just trying to work out where it's come from.
Can't you do a  a select?
Name select or something and pick out a  one of the pads with that hole?
No, you can't, there's erm  I see.
You haven't got anything unusual that's gonna be small.
No.
Oh I've got a  thirth three hold iron or on the er  crystals look.
Yeah, alright.
Tha , that's probably a mistake in the past  before we had all this changing.
Right.
I'll define  
Cos now we've gone up to thirty fives, I'm pretty sure.
Just er
They're both the same footprint, those two  
Sorry?
These two are the same footprint.
Yeah.
What about that one there?
Bedge?
Oh that's cute!
Oh ah 
Who got that one?
Little one there.
 
 
I think they should all be er 
I know what it could be!
I know what it is!
We know what it is.
Er
What a , what are Zener diodes called, shape?
Which ones?
Jus Just a normal Zener.
It's not on there but
Oh erm
It's on the back.
R four, no D  D three over four sixty?
Is that a normal , a normal Zener one, Z is 
 
is in some ways.
I think it uses the same footprint doesn't it?
Yeah.
Oh hang on, let's let's  let's do it the easy way.
It's very quick.
Two, three and a so sixty  that's good innit?
Whoops!
And si , six, six, six, six, six, six.
I bet you pound of thirty fives cos  that's a new one  machine.
That's a new component I put on there and that would be updated , yeah.
there.
That's what it is.
So all the thirty two's have gotta be changed to thirty fives.
Well , is it thirty three, or thirty five.
Thirty five rings a bell, erm  .
Oh, find out .
I can't find an easy one can I?
I could look at the library can't I?
Yep.
Cos I know they're all up to date.
You know the check  that went in?
Mhm.
Something vague with this split window innit in?
See if they're in the same file and two different bits  two  places on the file.
It's doing code and you need to change several entries or something.
Mm mm.
Just split your window.
Brilliant!
I'm not with you.
Well if you've got a big file  right?
And you're changing all your currencies of a certain variable
Yeah.
you can have it at the top where you've changed it and then the window underneath you can scan it through the file again.
Alright?
Brilliant!
Nice though.
You pick them .
Can't you just do a find?
Can you
Find and replace.
wait five minutes?
Yeah, you probably can.
Cos I've got something to take over, you might as well take them over .
Can you find the ye , if is there any yellow pads about?
We've gone right out.
I'll pick up somewhere.
Er, yellow pads?
You know the  you pull out the information.
So what were you up at lunchtime then?
Thirty seven is a different one altogether again isn't it Norm?
Hang on!
Make that the same 
After you 
call the same symbol alright?
I make it the same size  okay?
I wouldn't of thought there's sod all difference between thirty three and thirty seven.
No.
Yeah, but you have to tell it.
I'm not ready Norm!
Cos it sees both of those holes in the data range.
Oh ya!
Hey, I saw this bird Norm
Yeah.
Yeah.
That Justin's trying to er
Pull  pull.
but  he says he isn't!
Don't laugh!
He's completely ignoring me now!
Now I've seen him interfering with the smoke alarm now!
Thought that was quite remarkable!
Oh you know that we were talking about 
What she look like?
working here from the pub.
Dear oh dear oh dear!
Yeah.
Still soaring in he with that?
What a halibut !
E any good for a titty wank
No, no good for a titty wank 
No, totally bare!
A titty wank !
We used to call it breast fucking but that's much nicer!
 
No, too  
Tha , that's too descriptive.
titty wank 
All calls for a 
Titty wank 
tea break and I like that, I like the er  the phrasing.
Titty wank
Titty wank
Did you have a titty wank over the er weekend now your wife's back?
Ah!
No?
Not big enough mate!
No, nor  is that, bloody right !
What the tits or er   
 
Well if it was  if mine was small I'd be alright on mine.
Ah well!
Titty wank, I like that !
It's one of the funniest things I've heard for Oh, minutes!
Micro-seconds!
Urgh, what a horrible colour!
Norman's got the bland taste again.
Yeah.
I didn't set this one, this is bloody  he set 
Oh that's 
it up!
gross!
What?
Right.
Gross of public .
Expensive .
Yeah, get my posh car.
Do you know you could do this?
What?
Not edit within capitals.
Oh the software problem.
No I didn't.
I asked Daniel to leave.
Have they?
No.
No, no, no, leave the 
 
room.
Leave the room.
It's alright bu get off your high horse!
I was  just gonna say why?
No.
Well 
I don't know.
I reckon that  Daniel's .
Might be.
Has he had a bad appraisal then or something.
I dunno.
Dunno.
Kevin had one.
Well Kevin's a wanker!
His .
Erm
Well give us a shape to look at then.
Can't I get.
Sorry?
Come on!
How long you gonna be?
Not long.
Z three over four sixty?
Good grief!
On the score  sixty.
Mm, mm mm .
That's the way .
That's what we call innit?
What's five thou 
Thirty five thou for the lo 
Alright.
you take three under sixty.
What about  fourteen dip and under school  osc 
That's a nice one!
I think that was drill under 
Was any 
school table.
Are you sure?
You sure Bedge?
Drill un under school  osc 
What the first bit of that cos the thing in your mouth.
Fourteen dip  under school   osc Graphics are crap, look at tha , look at that!
Oh!
Gone completely !
It's not overwriting it is it?
Yes!
Right.
Have you got nothing else to do apart from squeaking chair?
Hasn't bought the bloody letters with it!
I'm here,.
Dash
Thirty three, forty six.
fetch !
Have you 
Bedge!
erased that layer?
Yeah it's all gone now.
Sorry I'll get the old 
Thirty three 
paint pot.
Thirty three is the oscillator
Right  it should be thirty three.
Well that's what they use in the library so that's a  I'll make sure the library ones are correct on mine, alright?
What are the other oscillators?
Thirty five is point nine.
That should be point eight five.
Should it?
Yeah.
So it should be dip , thirty three and
Yeah.
What's the other oscillator, that one that's   you lie flat
An eighteen    osc or something.
It's  H C eighteen.
H C eighteen.
Alright, we're gonna have to do a well hard copy here.
Oh shit!
That means we're gonna have to rebuild that bloody
Hang on!
Zoom in.
No I think the  I think they're there.
You might find they're with the scrap.
Okay.
It's it's  no problem.
It's found it all has it?
Yeah, should of picked it all up.
That's right.
I gotta rebuild this anyway.
What a bugger!
Yeah, the erm  small oscillator is a thirty three as well.
Alright.
Ah ha !
So there is a difference between thirty three and thirty five?
Correct!
Looks that way.
I'm gonna delete this one.
Although saying that  one we sent out to erm  
Yeah.
they actually drew the wall at point nine
Or point nine five.
oscillated everything.
The pads are big enough to take it  but when we a , you know that, when we had that problem about the er  what's a name coming up?
Yeah.
The solder coming up, we decided we'd go down to what  size it should be.
Yeah.
Thing is the th 
The bulk of the drawing rules were such that  you got the pin diameter plus  you know, their  size pads and all this and stuff.
Yeah.
So we basically done to what that is  although they said they were just gonna dri , drill a one point nine five
Mm.
and sort of run it from there.
Well it's a strange fault cos
Very.
Very!
They make a big thing about some things, and then some we're gonna drill all that point nine five anyway!
Yeah.
They made a big thing about us  sort of not using one millimetre holes  using 
Mm.
point nine five holes, cos that's standard  size
But that's  that's sod all!
Yeah.
We wouldn't have used one mill on the sc for out side counters and letters  they said oh no, they were gonna use wha you know er  what's a name?
Mr 
Point nine five.
Yeah.
Mr  was well upset!
Phylis?
Well upset!
Why?
They're gonna  charge him for casting his .
Well course they are!
He's dying though!
Poor chap!
If he was get, get in off his death bed  and  in.
 
Serves him 
And when 
right!
He's got 
When he did 
plenty of money anyway!
wondered if I should have his place.
When is it?
Er, tonight.
I can't play tonight.
I'm already playing tonight.
Yeah.
John  might.
Four point three O.
Four point three O, okay.
Are the printers on?
Think so.

What you'll have to do in here right, because E and F  you'll still have to have E and F  alright?
But quoted as the same size  alright?
Well E and F on here  is er  thirty three.
Oh right, sorry!
That's I me , erm  F and H.
Make them both point nine five then.
Well ho is this is E and F, thirty three, thirty five, how come we got  point eight five and point nine?
Well cos you got this lot wrong didn't you?
You did all the letters wrong.
No I didn't!
I put all the letters in and you told what 
Well you took them off that didn't you?
and then you told me what to put in on the plated through and stuff!
From that !
They don't tally do they?
I know.
Well only cos F is in there now.
Well that's probably where I'm wrong.
Hang on.
A is twenty.
Make
Hang on.
Go on you can work it out!
This is .
This is in millimetres and this is in millime no this is in .
They're all in .
And this is in mill 
Right.
We got it all written down look.
Okay, right, so point five is twenty, which you've got  right?
As long as your drill template tallies with this alright?
And you don't miss out any letters that occur  except for the L, right?
Cos we won't have any L's  right?
So  occur on that, right?
Mm mm!
So this is what we're actually 
You ne you need two.
this is what actually using on this design?
Yep!
This is the old one?
Yep!
Some of the holes are not used at all.
Yep!
So, are we gon do you get rid of the hole size along with letter.
No.
Keep, you'll have to keep the letter because that letter will come up  alright?
So  these details 
So 
will be put in here, this is what they're actually gonna use.
Yeah.
I mean, for instance, make erm  make F nought point nine five as well .
Alright?
Yeah, so you have to make them the same.
Yeah.
Right.
Cos so we've actually got F and H on the form.
Yeah.
On the .
Okay?
Yeah.

That it's been taken away.
Yep!
Therefore, on the  Web it says, completed!
Yep!
The er  people that pay the bills say  oh well that's no good to us!
What is the use of having this wonderful 
Well I 
 Web system 
Well 
when they don't fucking look at it!
It's supposed to be 
Well how do they know?
for everybody on site.
Precisely!
The whole system is 
But they're a , they're a law 
smooth running.
unto themself!
They still want a paper system!
They still want me to send  paper work to say it.
Which we do all that anyway, always do.
They're fucking useless!
No!
Wha what happens if the  good come from the store?
You don't have to do any paper work do we?
I do!
What's that for?
What's 
Tough!
that for?
Circuit boards and  tough!
No, you get paperwork from there.
Yeah but 
I know!
surely that system of paperwork shuffling is is gonna come to end with this.
Well it bloody should do!
Is it because well the whe whe when they  the good they come from internal store
Yeah.
they  that are sent over or what?
Oh I dunno!
I will just fill out what she wants me to do.
They'll probably  end up paying twice for it.
Because  I recko , I reckon they must of been paid for that because  Maury hasn't been phoning up and saying oh you haven't paid it!
They've obviously !
Yeah.
She usually pho phones you up about a month afterwards, you know  there is a sort of a problem.
I'm pretty sure we must have paid it cos I'm sure she would have phoned us.
Cos it's got my name on there.
She'd know it was me who got it.
Well it's not one of these weirdos!
.
What?
You wanna do it like this one though.
Yes.
Mm, fucking right!
Yeah, you're telling me!
But , you said you only wanted four lines!
Yeah I know but if I have, say if I have six lines
Yeah, well you then just go and change them for that one  drawing!
You can't see with the  th the colour,a better colour.
Like black or
Ah!
No, transparent's better innit?
Yeah.
You sure your right?
I'm sure you got some
That's okay, they're all  pins.
No, not pins, erm  veers and  veers aren't a problem.
You can check with the governor!
 
Small boy!
Small boy says it's okay.
Ah!
Oh God!
Fucking move them to those!
Ah, lol lol lol lol Oh !
Problems, problems, problems!
Oh er!
Right where are they?
Okay.
Why don't you do a Mark  .
Here  to here, forget it!
Now, if I  click on there  and see it
Delete it 
you've got 
now, but forget it.
We're not worried about that.
If I erase it I lose the  veer 
Ah, cos there's an extra  vire there is there?
Yeah.
But it stops short  and the other one overlaps it.
Ah, leave it then.
Yeah, I mean it's  silly things really.
Yeah, leave it.
Undo.
I don't know why erm
We should of done these before we erm
Out of the book .
Yeah, but leave it.
That's cos you had a  sort of go at it.
Yeah, if there's another re-work we'll sort these out to re-wire.
Tha that's why I'm a bit concerned about  messing around  s straightening and that sort of thing, cos I'm sure  I've had this problem before  I'm sure that it reduces a lot of er
Yeah, but you've still gotta do it.
You still gotta move stuff around ain't you?
Yeah, well what I do is I delete it 
Tidy it up.
Yeah.
and then I draw back in.
Cos afterwards 
Yeah, but then if you run this    your ri 
Yeah but , I think if you straighten lines and mess around with them too much  it leaves little bits in underneath the other one.
Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there?
By the time you've  you've moved them all  rather than drawing them all in again  then you run the  con activity  and swop back.
Cos you're gonna have to run  con activity anyway.
Well it's just down here  with the plate 
And another thing is to  is to  to run  con activity before you output the plot.
Yeah.
But a little short thing like that isn't gonna hurt is it?
No.
Leave that.
Right.
Okay.
Er, what else is there?
There is  , that's the er  crystal.
Yep!
That's good!
That's right.
Which had been forced.
Yep.
I'll just show you what was on there before.
See they're not fully connected.
No.
Move back.
Right, okay, let's have a look.
It looks okay.
Better colour, alright?
Er, so which one shall we  .
Yeah.
dunnit?
I can't see anything wrong with it to be honest.
Signal feed back is  non-reflectives.
Is it because this package has been messed around with?
And that thing should be a  a bra , a main 
No.
pin?
No?
Right!
Interesting!
Right, I'll show you this.
Hang on sec , I'll just look in
Right, it's here right  not fully connected right?
Now 
Yeah.
the problem here  is  between this point here  right?
Which is one of them, and I'll go over there, this is one of them.
So the thing is 
And there.
Yep.
There  right?
And
There.
there.
So it's between  it's just on that bit there?
Yeah, and also this 
S 
this bit here, which  which I was
Signal being traced, three nine four thousand.
That blue trace there  and this blue trace here  it says there's a problem  stubbing it.
If you mark it, delete it and re-draw
Yeah.
there's not another one underneath.
So I dunno why it's  causing a problem really.
 Stubs in signal.
It's not a trace, that those co- ordinates it's
 Bib bib Sorry, can I just interrupt?

Oh yes, but I mean I've finished 
That's the trouble really innit?

Yeah, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Okay, right.
I better take the tab out the video otherwise he'll erase it!
Not that I don't trust him or anything!
I think what it is
Yeah.
I don't think, when you draw this trace perhaps  it went just over the pin and didn't click it down.
Ah, but when it's actually done it'll be connected won't it?
Yeah.
.
Aha.
I'd like to get this out the way really cos then I can get on to something else.
Something

So they show all these really old videos and these guys 
Yeah, that's right.
are walking round with flared trousers and things!
Brilliant!
This guy, his flares must of been sort of 
No, no yo yo i isn't it funny when I thought it is a  fault, one of them  discarded the  right?
And they mapped it in Summer School
Yo you remember it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We saw him in  he's one of the  again, he's ju er, he sort of he act big.

Ah go 
Gone off the top !
Well just click on the  on pop-up so you get a  a new  a new window.
I can't.
Only in er   Bullmaster one.
Oh, you shoved it up sc , oh!
I can't get into the banner to move it!
Well put er, hit fault.
Default.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
What do I wanna do fault for?
Shut up!

Too late!

That ought to do it!
That's alright, just do a control C.
Yeah, just do a control C,!
No I wanted  a  
There you go.
We we'll laugh !
Fucking hell !
Wanted to do a 
 
That's brilliant!
Exactly the same problem again!
Don't ever
Oh God!
Too late!
Mark, you should say what you're going to do before you do it!
I got no  S S T talk today?
No.
Ain't those batteries run out yet Mark?
Well I se 
No.

Yeah, just about.
What you got round your neck for then?

Well I can't hear what he's saying then can I?
Well you can't fucking hear anyhow!
You still hit the fucker when he says don't!

Should always say it  like at least half a second earlier.
There's loads more now, look at this lot!
Yeah I know.
They're all the  with er  Eric.
Oh I got rid of that one.
 Doo doo The V back one  right?
Yeah, but they're  they're not really a problem are they?
Because this one 
As long as it , as long as it goes in
Yeah.
onto that thing.
Yeah, but you really should  I mean A D  characters not traced  right?
You really should check those.
Oh I have checked them.
But I was, I just bought you down here just to have a look.
Oh right.
Erm 
I was .
which report bar's that  the  Con one?
I just ran  Con again  and to add the new bar  to see if that be back one disappears.
Hang on a minute!
Er type the  or moor the er   con 
You will see more.
Cos it o , there's erm  a set up safe 
I didn't see eighty four before.
There's a set up that checks  a certain amount of areas and then blanks it otherwise you could be sitting there for hours waiting for a new  Con activity  so you just chew them off bit by bit.
Right?
Oh, so that isn't all the problems then?
No.
Ah!
So once you've chewed those you should run it again?
Yeah.
Oh I didn't realise that!
We should run it again anyway!
Ah!
So,you gotta run it again haven't you?
Yeah.
Well I haven't had that problem before though.
Cos you've never run it again  have you ?
No, I do.
No, I do, I do normally I  I'm pretty careful.
The thing I was getting so pissed off cos I've run it about ten times now, cos you keep coming and do alterations!
Oh God !
Andy says, oh we've gotta add a new  buffer in here so I'm  shifting stuff around and adding capacitors and 
Right.
 De dum 
, ay?
Ah ee!
That's your boss!
Listen boy !
I don't fucking know!
How the hell am I supposed to know where he is!
They're looking for you!
It's like asking me where Justin is!
!
He's at college today isn't he?
Oh that's good news!
Supposedly, he should be, yes!
That's different!
He must love Tuesdays so it means he can have an extra lie in bed!
They don't start till nine do they?
That's a lay in?
Well to be honest well if he he
Wanna see something clever?
Go on.
Little window up here right?
 

The thing about co-ordinates  why?
You get a little cross in that window
Mm.
then zoom.
Oh isn't that lovely!
Look!
you can see it's
That's lovely!
Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there  find out 
Yeah.
where it is and then zoom.
Yeah.
So you've, actually saving  
Clicked up on the C N C.
Yeah, just turn all items off in that window  all full board  right?
And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm
Isn't that lovely!
and you're there.
And can you zoom off?
Experience mate!
Can you zoom in on that window then?
 
Or is that always full board 
No it's 
type window?
it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it,
you can do everything.
It should go past the window.
So how do you  how  obviously you do 
 
you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom?
Yeah.
And then you go in there.
And then yo , you edit box in there.
If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way?
Yeah , I mean if you go erm  if I go zoom here right?
And then, quickly here
That does that, right.
Right?
But then if I go zoom in here 
 
Oh I see.
and I go into that pad, say
Single level three.
and you can't see it cos I got all items on but 
Yeah.
you just get a picture of that pad there 
So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows?
Yeah.
And  is on?
Yep!
Wonderful!
I like that!
It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now!
No, I've never used an extra window.
Yeah.
I ha , I do in  Ace but not in  Bullmaster 
It's just a good way to mark it.
But  ones like this to me, I think they're cos  if you 
Yeah.
just lay the trace over the top of the pin it doesn't come out.
Yeah.
Yes, that should physically click on the pin to get the wire to connect.
Oh I do!
Do you?
Mm mm!
And then do a  
But in terms of, in terms of actual  copper, I mean it is actually  when the, when the plotter goes over that pad that is gonna be connected.
Yeah, but it's still worth checking though.
Oh yeah!
But I mean they can be left can't they?
Yeah.
It's pointless trying to output them again.
And you hear what  say yesterday isn't it?
What's that?
You just only a piece of little metal.
Ha!
Sorry?
In lunchtime  you come in here and say  whe where's the board?
Oh!
I thought it was in, you said oh!
Piece of little metal is!
 
Yeah, he's er  gotta look out that guy ain't he?
Yeah but
Well he's stupid over everything!
When you  skive, you skive you don't let people know you're doing it!
But we tell him, long, long time and he just well said well yeah, yeah!
That's it.
And totally honest.
Don't,, I mean what  I trying to help him  you know the guy  he's in work 
Yeah, I've already looked at that one it's alright Bedge.
Yeah, but some people won't take advice will they?
Well tha , that was very rude to come fucking , a lot of things and he just say
Told him, yeah.
If he'd he'd have got 
I had a go at him the other week using a fucking hire car!
He took his car down to the  actually !
It was a hire car?
I don't mind if he asks you, he says look I'm just gonna go over stores , he took it off fucking site, didn't even know that's where he was going!
Yeah, oh I know!
Stupid  burk had gone on a  crane like that  
Yeah, yeah!
tell him to fuck off!
He's had it now!
Yeah and  you're responsible for it.
But I've gotta be responsible for it.
Yeah.
Bastard!
He was none too happy!
Ha, God !
How can, how many ?
I'll be very surprised if  .
Must be bloody !
Especially if this thing .
Yeah, it's
If they chop it off as well, I said they fucking  blinding you like hell you'd have  
Well yeah 
and
yeah!
I bet he'd speed it up!
Cor it's a lot slower when you want another network innit?
The old monster!
Oh good it's one  slade one now.
Yeah,
Mm.
Well no you're  well it's, it's a stand alone, but all your files are not  
Hang on!
Hang on!
Hang on!
What you got?
I think that's .
I just did that.
Oh right.
See you also get the bit up there with signals in this don't you?
don't give a shit!
Mm.
And window.
Oh it's lovely  dovely They're all the pins and the veers that it goes through.
Yeah.
All the pins.
No veers.
Ah !
Ooh!
Oh ho ho  the whole lot !
Well we have got 
Take this backwards !
erm
You can't .
He said all
about four days left to get this tested then up and running.
Yeah, Frank knows it's gonna slip.
It might, I've gotta   
Erm  
So that 
I'm actually full time after today.
He can't of done!
 
So get me to do it, it's only 
Yeah.
gonna be me and Paul fixing all the design and that on it 
Yeah, he says .
and you
Right.
hopefully.
You'll be giving us  
It's gotta have a shelf so it'll be a whole drawer won't it?
You done all the converting?
Yeah I mean we did the fourth  but
I haven't done the ball to be honest on this one.
I started reading up on it.
You know 
I've done all the schematic components.
Oh like getting  thirty four bars to a hundred.
And how do they do it?
There shouldn't be that, there shouldn't be that big a board really should it?
Well you get  
Yeah, but the trips he's using are big.
Is it on his own or what?
Should be something like that type of board.
Well I hope it's .
No, well no we're not using the LCC's, using dips.
What are they, forties?
Forties  and thirty twos, I think.
Well there's only a  what
One of them's  and all.
Yeah, but you've got all your  microcircuitry on there.
We're gonna have a R S fifty two, erm  H D L C 
Ah course, that's not showing is it?
That's right.
So you got those 
Oh it'll be a double  euro then.
At least.
I've got a box for a double  euro card.

Yes, I have tha , the really horrible one?
That's true!
Brilliant!
The wedding photo 
At least mine's natural!
Ha!
 Ish 
The wedding one a what, you know.
The 
two mark co-ordinate windows.
Yeah, one for one end, one for the other.
Yeah what I do is, I have specified so I  If I suspe the numbers are quite close I put one in there  have that, and I just do  reverse around and you 
Yeah.
can see the other one might rub off.
Do you know why I  back to Norman ?
Yes.
Norman?
Won't be much.
Won't be now , he's a Londoner he's bound to have had one!
You must have a  !
Yeah, but I won't say!
What's the problem?
You have to hit it again.
Well  to be honest I got too many bloody windows up there!
I got Ace up there now you know.
So you aught to be careful!
Alright.
Why?
Too many windows, it'll crash!
Well that's alright.
Well you can open
There it is.
It's that one and it's that one  colour.
Well I'm sure it'll be alright Bedge .
It'll be alright  on the night.
Fucking airline now!
Well that's alright innit?
Hope it's not fucking connected   
Well I ra 
work !
If you go on a st 
If you go on a  stat it says no airlines!
How do you account for that?
What?
You look at  stat which I just ran this morning  right?
My file called  stat it says zero airlines.
Don't beli 
Did you just delete that?
No.
No I didn't fucking  touch it !
You didn't?
Well what's that?
No, oh.
Have you put a different file name in?
Nope!
Just do more  stat and it'll say zero.
Total length of airline, zero.
So I sa , I took it that that was it.
Now more the one you just did.
I just did.
No, it couldn't be.
You ju erase it, it won't allow you to over , overwrite it.
Got to take them out the root.
See so that's why you should check the  con activity you see.
Ah!
You always  didn't I they tell you?
I do, that's why, I always do.
I do  stat, con and   rep after I've done D L C.
No I wasn't  about to go down and  do the  bizz 
Tell him off!
Bedge, come on, tell him off!
You've gotta be able to run a little tidy up programme, we should just get rid of all these  stubs and things!
It's like, tell us what's in the software.
Er
Come on Bedge!
So you're  tell him off!
Good job we ran this innit?
Yeah, if it'll .
Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran  stat 
I called it  stat I'm sure I did.
No.
Put it in the box.
In there.
Hang on.
Kick the mother fucker!
No, woh!
No, hang on!
Hang on a sec !
I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around.
Probably has you see.
Right, okay.
 
Point select.
Forwards  er
No airline!
Why don't you run with airlines on all the time?
Well I've got confused!
Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines!
That's right!
It didn't!
It said there was zero air , that means th there's none  there.
What do you mean none there?
Well there's one there now cos we just connected it.
If you a, right  I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right?
And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline?
No, you've  when you do a delete  erm  if you do  con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all.
I always have it on  sig as much as poss .
It defaults the  sig 
That's, that's usually what happens.
Anyway  that doesn't solve the problem now anyway!
Oh my God!
So we gotta do the bloody  thing again anyway!
Yeah.
Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in?
I wasn't told!
!
Well I  I mean I was, I was  relying on the, on the .
It's, erm, didn't you do these things like  erm  join the numbers up when you were a  kiddy 
Yeah.
You know, in these little books?
It's just like that.
That says  that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected!
You know?
Well the  con activity test told you it wasn't!
Well I hadn't got through that had I?
I would have discovered once I'd been through it all.
Good Lord!
Ooh no!
Ooh no!
That one's  get it like that  red  well that number's moved.
Yeah.
It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue
That's a bit of alive.
Hang on!
Blue, blue, green 
Boo ber ber ber ber ber .
Right, that's green.
Blue.
We bring that one red down there.
Doo doo .
Move these around.
We can go  no we can't cos of that.
This'll be a good one!
Do you want to do it?
Yeah, I can do it.
?
 
 Ow 
I mean we might as well pitch it now.
Pitch those plots.
Hang on a sec !
Wha what's happening here?
That can come right down here and then blue underneath.
Pull that one down.
Well I just wondered why it goes  there, in
It could go down one couldn't it?
It goes  hold that.
Well it's as broad as it's long really.
Mm.
That just says a bit.
Mm, no.
It just means changing it.
This is  the same thing though?
Yeah.
A bit devious isn't he?
One things gone down there.
Well Mark did it didn't he!
Well the problem is, is that you don't like  teeing off do you?
Don't like  teeing off signals.
It's gotta be
Yeah, you could of done 
come off at a pin.
So 
Yeah but you could of come across
Well I couldn't 
from there 
I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,.
I just pulled it up from that bottom.
Probably this again.
Oh but you see
It's alright, look
I mean that one
Hang on!
Yeah, but I mean that one  you could of shifted this lot  put some kinks in this one a bit, right?
Moved all that lot up.
Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in!
You could of gone round with the kinks 
It's horrible!
The kinks  
Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's  that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round.
Is that now?
That straight?
What you doing?
That straight?
What's straight?
That light.
Which one?
That one.
That one isn't.
I know that one isn't!
That it's an zoom delete it.
This is difficult really.
They're gone now.
Look!
Look at that!
Alright!
Don't fuck about!
Oh no Mrs!
Oh
No!
Gotta go!
No.
It's gotta go!
No.
You don't think ahead that's the trouble!
I do!
You're a  cunt Bedge!
Patronising bastard!
You gotta think head!
I think head everyday!
You've left a C print on there.
Hang on!
You've left a 
It's alright!
C pri 
I'm getting the  poxy bloody grid!
I why do I have to work with that grid?
Cos you can see what you're doing then.
Oh!
No, it's  all naughty and 
I find the 
horrible!
if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines.
I believe you!
There's a segment there left!
You just make sure 
What the hell did that jump across there for?
There's a fucking segment on there!
I told you there's a bloody segment, and does he listen?
No!
He  well he never listens  
He just goes and clicks the bloody buttons!
he never listens  to you anyway Bedge !
Look!
If the  
Ah 
it's still a bloody segment innit?
my God!
That's awful isn't it?
Ah!
And look 
 
at that!
Look at these D L C's you put in there look!
That's gone, right!
Let's just do board delete that'll probably help won't it?
Okay, so I'm coming from here 
You delete up to there!
What's that?
Oh it's the big airlines.
Yeah, yeah, that's the one  yeah, right.
Ah  like a bloody  
I'll leave you at it!
I'm glad to hear it!
God!
Run you over!
I'll get it sorted and I will do it again!
Cor, I dunno !
Look Dave, look!
Clever boy!
Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes.
Oh you're into 
Got my charger.
aeroplanes are you?
I'm into model aeroplanes, yes.
Oh dear!
Well , not recently but  I'm hoping to get back to it.
When I er  when I get the time.
Yes, yes.
I'll have to
From the  Hollies 
take .
the  Hollies 
Yeah.
Well  the trouble is they're so small now aren't they?
Yeah.
Because they restricted the area so much  if you got a big plane  that like, to by pass now.
It's all gone again now.
There was one 
Don't have a lot of time to think,You know !
there was one bloke over in erm  tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from  Hollies , and he lost his plane one day  and fle , flew out of range  and er  he he spent  weeks looking for it!
Couldn't find!
Because th the  the  sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for
Bloody!
er harvesting, and he was frightened that  he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it.
So 
But 
he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport
Oh God!
Must of 
And th 
cost him a fortune!
this guy flew him round and he saw it!
He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it.
Probably cost him twice the amount!
To hire a plane than the  thing's worth!
Well yeah!
I have heard cases of erm  planes being lost in  in er  crops  chu chur churned up!
Mm.
Farmers  aren't happy !
No I know.
But there's a couple of guys  in another division over there that  they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things  and then er, and experienced flyer  he'd  taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there 
Aha.
and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds  and he smashed it!
And they came back for another fortnight of re-building !
He said I saw too much!
Where's that bloody kettle?
Two weeks after he'd said
Haven't we  
ten second flight!
Hasn't  Yunny put the kettle on yet?
He's just gone.
He's just gone 
What a 
to get it.
what a lazy bastard!
I'll bloody steal his notes  
Yeah, when I first  I used to fly, actually screen flying.
Mm.
Tremendous you know!
I had this plane a  a low four nine engine   and I was only a kid.
I bought it in  village in  Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and
Yeah.
took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day  then this   stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like!
 
And it er  I think 
 
I think the engine cut at about 
Well Norm is stepping outside.
Is he?
Oh!
Is he?
Yeah.
Ooh, my God !
I'm a man myself, ha?
But er, is he though?
Erm  yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside   and er  what was this?
Er, I went out the next day to go to  er th yeah  that was a Sunday I lost it.
And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and  went in this forest trying to find it.
And we went round this estate  can't remember where it was  and erm  thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it  and then  later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it  and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his .
So I got it back.
That was lucky!
And it wasn't broken!
I was
Yeah?
absolutely  flabbergasted!
That was a bit lucky!
Could of been a gonner there!
Could of been indeed.
Drink?
Well  drop one, they're still looking.
They're still looking.
No, I  I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry.
Cos I  I got plenty of time.
Still looking.
Is there still the news about  carrying here?
Oh I could do.
I I I  I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er  I could still be the li , cleaner over here.
If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here  cleaning.
You gotta take a pay cut then?
Oh yeah well er  well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm  well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension  with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway.
If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid  well with my seventy pound a week pension  two hundred quid.
So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway.
I mean, sort of er  you know
Well, it sounds alright.
Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a  a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be  I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven.
The proper hours.
And  thing I suppose.
Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here.
Who don't know the job.
Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it?
Well yeah!
They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they?
Really?
I mean they're gonna  you know?
I mean, if I sort of just stay  for a, for a while but er  I've still keep looking for work  looking for a job  cos I do wanna get away from B T.
The sooner I get away the better!
But  I'm not in a hurry at the moment.
So I can't go anywhere anyway.
I wanna erm  hopefully er  hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money.
Buy one.
Weren't gonna splash it all out  you know?
All at once?
No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years.
I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand.
Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er  I'll still have a little bit.
We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any  you know, we sort of keep some in there.
Keep some in the 
Yeah.
building society.
At least, at least if I had another job you see and er  well I'm taking home two hundred odd  two hundred pound a week.
Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension.
I wouldn't need to touch that money.
That'd still be erm  that'd still be in the er  still be in the building society could be making me money.
Yeah.
I mean er
You get some er  the old interest 
There's the 
can't you?
Well especially if you put it in your high interest.
Yeah.
Which once I've wo , which I will.
The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you?
Ah?
You can't get the money out very quickly.
Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out.
Oh well, yeah.
That er
So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem.
Yeah.
Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er  .
You know?
Just report or not.
I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account.
Yeah.
You could do that can't you?
Oh yeah, split it up as you like!
Oh!
Oh yeah, but er  but I'm not in a hurry anyway.
I've got plenty of time.
John!
Right.
Your tea cup got  .
How dare you !
Phone!
Okay, boy  
 
Oy, slaphead!
Me?
Yeah, the chap from   Arkworth Generation for you.
Excellent!
I'm not sure  this machine  the actual driver board  can  I know.
Yeah.
Because I've been trying to swop  between that one and that one.
In that we see  the one coloured drive right?
Yeah.
We can re resist the and run from  to that  copy.
When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen.
And I took, he swop it  he he wouldn't  three sixty two.
No.
I'm not sure, is it the driver  that's the problem or not?
So  you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work.
I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in.
We will have some money left behind  not a lot.
Cos the machines in my old office  all of them, all the five and a quarters agree  both types.
And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties.
Yeah.
Yeah!
I mean this one can   
I mean what is  what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty?
Useless!
And erm  the one I got, in there  can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem!
As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it?
I think it's something to with the, with the actual er  driver board.
Yeah.
And you get all set one wha erm  setting.
You gonna have, you can't have a few.
So we may have a, quite another a board or what?
I don't know.
They will let you know.
They'll have to!
If I could get my .
Then I could have that machine and  Justy can have mine.
One.
What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six.
How do I know what's having ?
Who's getting the other one then?
I dunno.
Mm.
I have a lot of feeling  right?
That's it's .
When these boys has come along  and Colin would  he look at John  and what do boys say?
Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing  compiling that 
No.
needs  fast processing time.
Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off!
But Colin  I mean 
Frank said to you you can have 
Yeah.
cos you need it for your work!
Yeah, but  Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet!
Don't make any  don't make war!
I don't know it, so I keep quiet.
Don't make  
Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine!
Yeah.
How's that then?
Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's  just a three eight six.
Cor God!
That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine!
Well there's no point!
But, I have  Bedgey look  to be honest right  he do more compiling than me.
If he want the forty six  , I mean the forty six I give you  this.
And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my .
But, he said if if Franky order another one  he say, I shall have a forty six.
Be , originally  they order two forty sixes  one for Colin and one for Andy.
Mm.
But  when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing!
Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so
Well, I will, I will get it  and all the  will come in here  and we'll hide it or  whereby  no no, no one will fucking see it!
And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck  oh ho!
It is isn't it?
Oh what a pity!
Can you stick in that box?
But the thing is, they look so different.
Don't they?
And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it.
Completely different, re-designed box and everything.
You still using that monitor?
No.
Wo , have a look at this monitor?
Ay?
Come here, it's your monitor, everything.
So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha?
Yeah, you, you can get everything.
Oh right.
But we asked erm  Colin,di did he want a monitor?
And he say no!
Mm.
Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A.
They can give you twe , two hundred  two hundred and er, fifty six colour.
So 
Is this V G A or E G A?
That's a Philips, a V G A.
Is it?
It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A.
Oh!
Sixteen colour.
If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is  compared with the wha you put in  there .
Oh yeah.
So I don't know  what is going on!
So I'm not  over exciting .
A Bloody politics place !
Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine.
Right!
I better get the  out then.
And my bloody !
Ow!
Well, and I put an order in to buying erm  two more of these five and a quarter inch.
It'll  rebo 
Mm?
That will,wi tha tha will  rebo soft.
Yeah, but  I think th , probably the thing with number
Then the driver innit?
Well if it can't, it can't.
Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they?
Yeah but doesn't matter!
In this group, doesn't matter.
In other group, maybe.
Mm.
In this group ,.
So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some  some level if you want what?
One.
If you wanna thick one   want a monitor  this way,, but not a lot.
So you don't wanna put all that in.
But it does  or some order.
But whereas anyone order from this company say well    what do you want?
Do you want a big one or a small one?
If you want a huge order  oh you can look for your own.
When Len  sent them a five pound order, or ten pound
Mm.
you can leave that .
Th there is a  if there is work in our group, no problem!
As soon as we've been , all been  
We'll have to  write that one with a  indelible pen.
Yes.
You only get on go at it as well.
So that is
I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose.
Maybe, I think you can get erm  erm  in, what they done on Norman's   they're using a tape.
A tape?
Oh that's messy!
Er well  if you're gonna draw the line I mean  I mean it's bloody  we know what  who's in, who's out.
Yeah.
Yeah, have a chat with Norman.
Okay.
The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box  right?
Is one six one  and this is  it's ha!
You're hoping!
Yeah.
It's not going into anything is it?
No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right?
It'll have 
Norm!
Yeah.
it'll have four
How do you change
 
Look likes   the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right?
Yeah.
Cos I put erm
So that's gonna be  a bit small, but 
a dimension in there.
we're not gonna have these connectors on  so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we?
Yeah.
Talk to me!
Cli ,wha what's the depth?
The depth is erm
six four one.
four one.
So how big's that?
That will take us  is it clear up 
Oh right!
to there, to here.
Erm
Yeah, okay.
Well what we can do
No, what we'll do first  ride 
is put in a connector, you know those connectors?
Yeah.
That these fellers are on?
Yeah.
You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board  and then you have another board, a board with a   so you can
That's what I was saying!
cut the pillars  those there.
Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to  might not be able to get it all on.
Cos that  is like  a sixth of the area isn't it?
What we'll do  alright?
Mhm.
I reckon .
If we erm  I'll get a  if I got time today.
Alright?
Yeah, so basically
Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today.
Start , see what the  actually gonna do.
Yeah, like , yeah?
I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta .
Am I that boring Frank?
I didn't 
Yeah  !
say anything you know!
No, not half!
I didn't.
But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were  actually.
How old did you think I am?
What an insult!
Erm
He's not that old are you?
No, no .
I suppose about be erm  fifty nine.
