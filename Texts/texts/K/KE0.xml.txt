Oh!
We had Dave's mum up today.
Oh did you?
She's lovely!
How is she?
She's not too bad.
Not too bad at all.
A lot better than she was that holiday?
Oh yeah!
Yeah, I think so.
She didn't wanna go back.
Mm.
It's always the problem.
She, never wants to go back, but  she really did enjoy herself!
It's the first time she's been out of there since.
Oh is it?
Yeah.
She went in there the end of September, so she's had October, November, December, January 
That's right!
Feb , five months.
She's been in there.
Has she not been to her daughter's?
Nope!
She was gonna go up there Christmas day  
 
and she fell  Christmas Eve wasn't it Mon?
Christmas morning.
Yeah, Christmas morning
Mm.
got a big gash down her leg
Oh that's right, you mentioned 
so she never went.
about that.
And since then nobody's ever offered.
So we said to her last week  Dave and I talked it over  and, I didn't realize he was gonna spring it quite as soon as that, but  he did, and everything went alright so, I said, well we'll try her for tea, a couple a hours didn't we Mon?
Yeah.
So we picked her up at about twenty to three and we took her back there at  quarter to eight?
Yeah, and she's
Did you have a power cut?
Yes.
I will look forward to 
Oh my God!
and of course was there.
of all the days I've gotta have a power cut as well!
what time was that?
Three o'clock to five o'clock someone was saying.
About twenty to three it went off.
We all sat round the van , the  caravan about quarter to four  and she'd just got one, she'd got one of her friends and they got theirs about quarter to four.
Well ours didn't go off 
Quarter to five.
cos we had the telly on.
No I  
They reckon it was all of  Dawstone all of Corfe Mullen.
We weren't off.
Cos I rang them up.
You weren't off?
No.
No.
Must have pinpointed your system.
I could have gone round to  couldn't I?
In my jumper couldn't I?
Oh dear!
Not with !
I could have .
Yeah !
I would have brought 
No!
my own iron.
Yeah !
I could have done that.
Left it on the  front doorstep !
Oh weren't they greedy on the village, today?
Well I think  see now, that's because their paper 
Did they have it all?
They read it out of the horoscope.
No!
No.
So it's most important.
But it they read that off 
Bet three hundred something odd pound and they 
What and lost it?
and quite, no surprises!
That's what happened last week!
How much did it cost them?
Yeah.
They had quite a lot of money last week.
Did you hear them say about the horoscopes?
Waiting for this programme    and erm  when the husband, her partner went home  they'd been to see this , I don't know quite what happened 
Mm.
She said, I can't believe what it says in the paper any more 
Mm.
last week in a T V programme.
But they we , quite convinced they were gonna win and I think this is what was behind it.
Yes, oh I didn't hear that much.
So he bought the cutting with him and said they couldn't it.
What, so they obviously believe in their horoscopes?
Mm.
Yeah, cos you can read into it what you want these things re , can't you 
Yeah.
really?
Well I think she felt, as they went  I was  sitting reading all about horoscopes but they did win.
Mm.
But they just got greedy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
Turn that off for a minute.
No!
Turn it off a minute I got a joke.
I'm .
Turn it off!
You
Norma  couldn't get it  and her voice was getting louder, and louder, and louder!
I sat down here Tuesday night and she was going, what she's saying?
Something  what?
 
And it was going louder and louder and louder!
And then we had to tell her in the end!
Can you be quiet !
Oh oh!
Everybody else was in raptures!
And I thought, oh  not Norma.
It does  though I know that that programme that's all being recorded  there's a funny atmosphere.
See you might even be starting up the classes.
Oh I know!
But then, she probably might not.
The Camon it's called the Camomile  Camomile Lawn.
Oh
Oh!
that sounds lovely!
Yeah, they've had it  excerpts of it on television haven't they?
Well, Di saw it and  recorded it didn't they?
Yeah, I mean the the film was quite long though 
Mm.

Yeah.
With erm  oh!
Felicity Ke 
That's it!
Kendal.
Yeah.
Yes.
And she says she's got 
Yeah.
Cos she was smoking like 
Yeah.
a trooper too wasn't she?
Soon as they did their words there's like a  another fag!
Not,she sounded  like !
Oh Robin, you have had a short cut this time!
Oh he's weird he is, you know, isn't he?
Anyway, Robin had rushed himself   and I think Robin wanted to get out early and Colin was probably going first 
I'm busy now , thank God!
Yeah, but  
then he weren't 
at Colin's, and he said no, you go first  and when he'd finished Robin's, he said, I don't want it as short as that!
He went quite spare!
And it's what you call 
 
an economy one, you know!
Oh is it?
Yeah !
We've got to take our holidays before the end of March, so
What did  said went wrong?
Oh well when I got up there of course you just 
He just came up, he came here 
went strai he out there to see him.
And  I mean  there was hair on the tables, you know where he'd been
Oh!
or   and apparently he'd lost a strip.
When's he going to take a lot of this then?
Wednesday.
Wednesday, it must have Thursday, well  he sat in the store as they called him .
Mm.
Mm.
It was a good idea!
It was 
Mm.
yeah.
The only thing is, the  went in the back of it!
Yeah, I'll tell you something too 
He dropped something, a screw or something, he went all over the, the floors!
He's a fruit case really
isn't he?
Oh no!
Him and his dad!
He left our dad's at half past ten.
What, at night?
Yeah.
at night.
Oh, he shouldn't allowed on the road should he?
Doesn't make any difference as far dad's concerned.
I don't think he's taken it.
How did you know?
Oh no.
Well he  he just to 
Who me?
Bu Mr  doesn't eat does he?
He doesn't eat?
No, not when he's going round 
He eats my
I mean.
cake.
he eats everybody else's food but he doesn't cook for himself apparently.
Who was saying what his house was like?
I think it was Colin.
Your dad  dad  annoys me really because  he gives him so much, you know?
Like 
Mm.
er  go and get his haircut  the cost of everything.
Yeah, but he thinks he probably does.
Yeah.
He's just too busy to pay for his fees.
I mean you don't really get a straight do you, when you get a 
No.
job.
And I mean, say  if there's apples or anything like that, go and say, help yourself to apples  he'll fill his bag until he can't get another thing in!
He don't!
Yeah!
Well he doesn't just have a few.
I mean they're gonna be 
No, no 
thrown
Yeah, that's right.
he fills his bag 
That's right.
until he can't get another one in.
We go .
Yeah, that's right!
That's right!
I mean, you'd think he'd just have a few enough to make a pie or a crumble 
That's right.
or something wouldn't 
Yeah.
you?
But the thing is, I doubt if he does make anything out of that cos that's probably  
I mean that's being greedy!
.
Yeah, but all ?
Bit greedy!
He'll have the runs for a week!
 
Yeah, and he'll go.
He must worth a fortune then, Marg?
I don't know if he is or not.
I mean, I said to .
I don't know.
I've no idea, probably  I should think.
I, I wouldn't think he was rich.
I don't know, maybe he is.
Yeah, but if he doesn't anything.
Cos, Colin was saying how antiquated his house is.
Yeah.
Oh, has he been in there, Colin?
I think so.
Yeah.
I can imagine it.
I, and he said  he still, he hasn't got a proper cooker or anything or
He, no, he's got no television has 
No.
he?
And when irons he  he boils up  boils a saucepan of water and puts the saucepan  over it !
Oh!
I couldn't believe it!
I said to Colin, you sure?
He said, yeah he said, he told me.
He's house proud  
I don't care !
He said he wets them.
Urgh!
Probably at that age!
Urgh!
cleaning and washing his pants!
No!
Incontinent.
Yeah.
How old is he?
He's nearly
He must be eighty 
eighty ain't he?
odd.
Yeah, he's eighty.
About  , near eighty.
Where was that  set aside?
Holiday?
Was it?
That was in the paper.
Yeah, that's just what I said.
Saying it, it was just as if 
Yeah.
Do you reckon he's still worth 
 
a fortune?
Several thousand.
Trouble is you don't know anyone who is any more, do you?
No.
Not really.
I expect he is.
Yeah, I reckon .
Even on paper.
But I mean, a millionaire on paper
No.
there isn't many these days.
I mean, he was a millionaire on paper, years ago when millionaires were still
That's right!
well respected 
Yeah.
now, they're two a penny aren't they, almost?
Well I don't Marg, I'm not one of them!
Nothing to talk about!
I'm not!
No!
Someone's !
I know, two of them still 
I always think a family's born to that  
that I know of are definitely millionaires.
Oh really!
Yeah.
And they're so ordinary  people  that you'd never believe it.
You won't know.
I mean, ten years ago, maybe twenty years ago, I wouldn't have known anyone at all that had been millionaires.
Ya , I mean they wouldn't mix with the likes of us!
No!
Yes.
That's right.
The riff-raff,and the rabble !
But I mean, now they do.
They're ordinary people.
Well that's .
Mm.
Yeah.
But they are ordinary people.
Oh a lot of 
Oh yeah.
ordinary people have become millionaires.
Yeah.
I mean one is, Jean's  mother  she is, she's a millionairess in her own right.
Mm.
And the other one's Harry.
So you do know another one.
Now I mean Harry wo , would he strike you as being a millionaire?
You've met him.
Yeah, I me mes , what Harry ?
Mm.
Oh yeah, Harry!
You've met.
Oh yeah!
Sean .

But, I mean, I wouldn't have thought that.
You see I    he came round and dug our footing, Sean!
Sat there 
He's lovely!
and he had his beefburger the same as everybody else.
Yeah.
Belched the same as  everybody else !
Fine!
Bound to .
Yeah!
I don't think  
And, now he's as ordri as ordinary as anything.
I just don't think you get everything about him.
Must have knocked them off!
Yeah !
That's !
Yeah.
I don't think you get health out of anything.
If you can be a rich woman  you would !
Money can't buy you 
Yeah !
I think it can definitely make you happier.
I, I do think it's meant to be there to actually .
Yeah !
Makes you wonder !

Oh I think so.
Oh a little boy, yeah.
There , yeah.
Yeah.

So they're quite young then Marg, really?
Yeah.
And he's won every penny I reckon.
No his wife.
 
Oh it's
Mm.
It's,wa his wife, yeah.
That's horrible isn't it?
A brain tumour  they cause but I mean  he said last week he spent every penny he had to get her through it and this 
Yeah.
week  he's got so much money he's still spending it on her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Lovely, innit?
Yeah.
There's gotta be someone out there though, that'll take him for a ride!

I found it funny!
It cost the poor milkman a fortune to get them to pay him up for the milk people said they didn't get, you know!

The chap who tried to call, the one watching it?
Behind, yep.
Yeah, he's still there.
I was gonna say er  somebody told me that he'd left and I thought it was you cos nobody would .
No, he's still here.

Personally, maybe we just  
Did I tell you what's happened?
They sent you all notes on 
Well it's quite naughty 
and then you won't 
cos Goodwood's sorted isn't it?
you'll expect that they  The coach was burnt out down in  Beatmore , if you remember  and then the  the police  took them August there
Di , no,th October.
police took him in that night cos they thought he'd burnt it out himself.
And it's taken all this time, it's gone to court and all the rest of it, and they haven't got a case.
So, they couldn't do anything in the meantime.
I should think 
Well they 
that was genuine.
the banks wo wouldn't let me have extra money or anything like that.
Oh!
They're trying to get somewhere now  with the police but  it could have happened anywhere!
No it's alright!
But this, this bloke has sort of said, ooh he said, apparently one of the blokes  that were working for him said  that he had overheard him saying they were gonna burn the coach out.
Oh!
And if this chap said, the one that took it that night, he said there is no point in him doing it because he didn't have the coaches insured for enough.
No.
No.
He took this bloke in, he didn't have a job.
Isn't it mean?
Mm.
You know the er
It is.
Cou po , could possibly 
Yeah.
going on the what not.
And did this chap do it?
They don't know who did it.
No.
They tried to make Jim had done his own coach, the one that took us over 
Yeah.
there.
Yeah.
But he le , they let him go off on holiday in the end.
It wa it was the night before they went on holiday.
How depressing Marg!
I mean I can understand it in this day and age, people trying to
Get their money back.
Yeah.
Get their money from insurance policies and try and make their money back 
I suppose what it really amounts to, it's probably someone who's in the same line of business  and they're trying to get the best way aren't they?
Mm.
But it's a nasty business isn't it?
I know.
That's , you moving about?
Yeah !

Dave's got a  job pretty well hasn't he?
I've done it.
Yeah, I saw it last week here as well!lo , lot shorter otherwise he'll be complaining his ears are growing too high!

You, you !
Now you're being rude!
Right, right.
Yeah and  
That's what I like.
No, you you put your own, David down there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that, I mean they still got the different, if you're playing  like a shot   
I think you do.
I think you do because
I mean, we got nine players  and  once you've drawn that out  you either leap forward by  
What about the places you go to put eight or nine .
eight singles and that's that problem .
But you can.
You could have a  coming around every week and two  you don't get it.
And you talk about buying them young, you can  got them, cos he knows  .
Yeah.
.
With you coming in, nobody knows they're at the gate.
No, I I see what you mean.
Alright!
I like the .
today  do you get four at home and four away.
Yeah.
And that goes on aggregate  on the night, yeah?
Yes.
And the, as we got our own side  they can, they can win  perhaps they just   around
I'll do it.
the way  going back they got  before.
Whereas me and you got a team together, you said forty two playing league and four playing here and four playing a league game.
That's right , yes.
So you got .
Oh no you do , you  no, no!
Well yes.

You play    four on the team  the four on the team play a go right?
Then, whichever played a one  that game  go away again.
Yeah.
So you've got the same ?
!
Yes, alright then.
Then you play, you play yo you play four singles  four singles, four singles and two doubles.
I was thinking you played .
I mean they go away, I mean  the six always played at the back.
but everybody else is.
Brian was saying, he said  you going in with your   he said and we'll lose that , he said he should play his best bloody
Well yeah.
six you've got!
But darts don't work like that .
If you're going to win you gotta play you're best six .
That's right.
That's right.
You've got to, but  then again, you know 
Unless you're not bothered.
Unless, unless, unless, unless you won and then you get best .
Well no, you ge if you won and give the rest a game.
See we're not bothered.
We're, we're, I mean we're not  we're not that bothered  really  .
Yeah, but no  could we?
I mean 
Well we could, we could help you  
I mean we want, we want  well, to tell you truth, we shall won on that, we won on that occasion.
I put on, I put on my best two doubles haven't I?
And left  left
Well I only said whatever you want to do.
Do you wanna go up for suit .
I said, that's all we want.
Now, you know
We go out to win on the night, we're playing tomorrow 
Exactly!

Everybody goes on about .
If we win without it, we come in the first five that's all well and good.
We you go out, do you go out to win?
Everybody 
But

you don't argue about it.
If we lose, we lose.
You don't, I mean I'd like to win it every bloody week but, I'd be chuffed.
I'd be as happy as a dog with two dicks!
I mean they stopped us Friday didn't they?
They thought it would stop us didn't they?
You thought it would stop us as good as they did.
What, seven two was it 
Six 
or
No, six.
two.
one of them.
Mm.
I mean we played good, but just  couldn't get out and they did.
Well the door was open and nobody were worried about that.
Don't you remember that thirty doubles.
What, they got it?
They got it?
The only worry about  that was Brian.
Yes, you're right.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Played out of his skin again.
But er  he, I had some .
Played, he played out of his bloody skin till half way.
He couldn't of played as many, he'd have bloody 
Well that was .
But the 
Cos he hasn't got any .
That, I sort of said   who was it?
He plays like you said.
I was going to old Chris, I said  I said he should play in the  class.
He's quite a good player .
I said, he eats about a as much  as much as like a corn packet  !
Ah, Brian, Brian, David has never met you.
And he went
He would be on the , good that hole!
Good that hole!
And he went bump, bump, bump  took the prize down and I said, and I walked past  we   said like, to his mate Chris, I said, he's improved a damn sight more  than I'd have thought.

Yeah!
I thought you said they've got a chap 
Well 
He did.
Full .
Yeah.
Get that.

Yeah, I know we 
But we can!
can!
The sheep to cross the road and 
Mm.
quite unusual!
I'd never seen it before and that's the one time I've seen it.
I can remember when you'd see  a cloud of dust, perhaps it'll be a mile away  and this would be  a flock of sheep.
Course, they hadn't had  lorries in them days, they drive them on the road  and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs  and goodness knows how many sheep!
And of course, the roads were all gravel then, no tarmac, see this cloud of dust across there.
And er  if you see it was coming towards  of course you run into them, but if they were going the other way  course the dust still keep going.
But  but of course this was many years ago.
Never see a flock of sheep on the road now.
It's all done with cars.
You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
It er  oh!
It used to be  occasional or more perhaps, sometimes show time  different shows and that.
So many sheep  or, ha  show time see, you see these flocks of shop  but now you always 
Been to a cattle market.
That's a long time ago because se the roads have been tarmacked for goodness knows how long now!
I can remember when the first bit of tarmac was put on a road round here  and that down here at Upton bypass  and all 
Oh yes!
what they call Upton bypass.
Yeah.
Oh it was er  cry over war wound!
Oh!
Horses will never be able to stand on it!
It's slippery and that.
What a state they were in then!
My father had er, horses at that time and  my uncle out at Holt, he had some horses  they were talking about this one day and  uncles would say  well a horse didn't work nearly as hard with that  road's were nice and solid.
Father said well it's, it's so slippery they can't stand on them.
But it wasn't, it wasn't slippery see, but they thought it would be.
Yeah.
An oh!
I can remember when that  Upton bypass, when it was done  the cry there was about that!
Mm.
Course, it  it used to be the old rough gravel road.
Can you remember Ascot Road?
Mm?
Ascot Road?
Ascot, oh!
Er no 
The little shack
Mm.
then, it was meant to be the oldest house.
Mm.
No.
No.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
No?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Aye, aye, aye, aye.
Just off Clarendon Road, dad.
Eh?
Just off Clarendon Road.
Clarendon Road?
Er  ooh yes!
Clarendon Road, yeah.
Course I ye , I walked up the top of Clarendon Road there when a I was first going out to work up there  old Bill .
Yeah.
Mm.
I can remember that.
Well 
Mm.
it's a road that goes through there to Swingdale Road  and there's a little place in there.
Little blue and white wooden hut.
Mhm.
It was.
I dunno.
Over  my uncle er  old Harry   he had a house around Clarendon Road  er  oh I dunno!
There wasn't many houses there at that time.
Mm mm.
We built our house there.
Mm?
Erm  it was meant to be the oldest house in erm  Broadstone
Ah?
and we built our hou , not, bought the plot of land and built our own house on it.
Well  old Harry  shared with my uncle  he had his house and he bought a piece of land on the bottom of his garden  and he built wall on  his  or this piece along the bottom of his garden, but er  I couldn't tell you, it wasn't very far up the road.
But er  yeah I know.
But I haven't been up to cla Clarendon Road for some time now.
Er  ha!
There used to be a  a house on the end of the common up at Clarendon Road, the opposite side  oh!
Er  old Mrs   I dunno, but th , anyway there was  only this one old house up in the common and er  I went up there one time with  horse and   take a couple of pigs from there down to Wimborne market.
But I suppose the old house has pulled down under pressure and built on now but  that was the only house going up through there in them days.
That was a very old house!
Wimborne market's supposed to be old.
Mm?
Wimborne market must be very old!
Oh Lord, yes!
Course  we , Wimborne cattle market is finished now isn't it?
I went to a cattle market in 
Mm.
Devon
Mm.
with my aunt.
Ah yeah.
Er   ha !
Wimborne market every Tuesday  and Wimborne horse sale every other Friday.
Used to have  horse sale every fortnight, see every other Friday.
Ha!
You wouldn't think that there was a  enough business to want a horse sale once a fortnight would you?
But  mm.
Course, it was horses in them days, not motorcars.
I can remember  first motorcar that we drove in   old Charlie  's.
Old Charlie's  car  wooden spokes, wooden wheels  solid tyres  and he used to sit up right in there  same as I am now, like in a box  and the old chauffeur   was the chauffeur driving along.
And I suppose they go along about  I don't expect they do about six miles an hour.
Just, chug, chug, chug, chug.
At least it was some other form of transport than a horse.
Oh yes!
Gave the horses a bit of a rest.
Mm.
Er er er  er er er
I would think the mo , motorcar nowadays can go up to something like two hundred odd miles now is it?
Yeah.
Mm.
And when you see them racing on the television!
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Ah!
But don't matter what it is everything is increasing in speed.
Now you see  in my days on the railway  sixty miles an hour was a good speed for a train it di it didn't reckon to  do much more than that see.
I know  er, down at  Corfe Junction or a  one road across or one another across or  there was one road going to Wimborne, one going to Broadstone, up road and down road.
And of course, they had these signs up  about la up close to a signal  er  twenty, twenty five or thirty or whatever it was, that was miles an hour, they were supposed to reduce to that.
And er  I can remember one day a driver, Len  his name was and  he er  he said to the inspector, oh he says er  I've been through  Corfe Junction he said at sixty miles an hour!
What!
Ooh he said, you don't wanna make a song about it!
But he said, I have done.
And er  course, that where the restrictions was on see  at the  and of course, after that, a few years after that, of course take no notice of it now.
It all goes on the same.
Er  er  it were just the same on a motorcycle  the faster he'll go the better they'd like it!
It's still the same nowadays isn't it?
You get the youngsters that hare off down the road  .

Can't you afford to find you know, your own house or  rent a place?
Would you, if you had the chance 
Well not really, no.

Probably not.
It's their choice to run away.
How old were they when they did run away?
Mm  one was seventeen, one was six, and
Making the choice  !

No.
My hu , my six year old ran away, but 
Yeah but when

And how he's surviving?
He might even be dead for all you know!
That's sweet!
Don't you care?
Well
Aren't you a bit, the slightest worried  
Why 
You're not concerned?
Why did you have children then if you weren't prepared to

I haven't got anything else to say so could I be chairperson please?
Yes.
Yeah.
Order !
Thank you !
Thank you.
I feel this meeting is straying from the point!
What we must achieve is a balance.
True, the merits of the squirrels for the environment are very erm   meritus 
yet we must also consider what's best for the people.
Are these retirement homes necessary?
Yes!
No!
No they're not!
No they're not!
There are loads and loads of empty office buildings which could easily be converted into very nice retirement properties.
And think of all the houses on the market at the moment that aren't being sold!
These  and 
Are they 
Excuse me!
purposely built for people with disabilities who are getting quite physically disabled  and they are desperately  needed!
Indeed!
Yes.
Yes.
But you 
And also an office 
Well I 
block are not, they put in the centre of town!
These retirement homes need to be  in the country, they need to be
I'm not
You're disturbing the wildlife!
surrounded by the natural environment.
And you can't get 
You say about that how can they go in that shop?
They couldn't buy .
Instead it 
If they're beco 
comes round!
If they're becoming as disabled as you think they are, they won't be allowed just to go down the way to the shops will they  if the nearest shops are twenty miles down the road!
The retir , the retirement homes are being strategically placed in that position  enabling people to be in a real central position so that they can get to all of the amenities they need.
But if they're in a real central position they can't be out in the country 
Country!
because you've chopped all the country down!
So  how can they be both 
Have you, have you asked the people
near the country and near the shop?
I presume you've asked the old people  whether they want their countryside to be destroyed or not?
Well of course we would!
How do you think they feel they live in a place 
Have you  , have you asked them?
Yes!
Have you actually did an opinion poll?
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Yes!
You've asked?
Does that mean 
 
Had a go on the machine 
If you count the number of characters 
characters and the different situations.
Different problems.
 
Yeah.
things.
.
We've had one or two people homeless once
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
I'll be homeless!
So what does everybody else do?
I must admit, I like the one  I liked that one.
Oh no!
That'll be good!

Shouldn't mess about round here!
And he was at London Zoo
And he was

So, he broke out and went into this 
He found a lover.

And they went upstairs
Although he's only a panda, and they never manage do they?

Pandas!

Is that why you don't 
They always have erections on them!
Yeah!

What am I thinking?
Come on!
With this prostitute 
 
And anyway, the panda went upstairs with this prostitute and erm  well he was a bit peckish so they had something to eat.
And erm, after that they got down to the serious business!
And, when they were, the was panda was about to leave, you know, he's all ready and the prostitute thought well  well he can't realise  so she  got th , her dictionary out and looked up pand , looked for prostitute  one who avails herself for money.
And not to out done, the panda got out his own dictionary and looked up panda, one that eats, shoots then leaves!
Ah!
Ah!
And leaves.
I like that joke, it's funny!
They're good panda jokes!
It's silly!
That's why everyone's laughing then !
I like it!
 
I like it!

Aren't you glad you got Simmone to record all this for you!
Well today is Wednesday and we start the day with a thrilling lesson on  
 
Well what do you think Mr microphone?
Do you prefer Eugenie or Beatrice?
I think they're both pretty crummy.
I happen to prefer  Beatrice.
Beatrice sounds like characters out of those nineteen twenties B B C historical drama things with the 
Oh yeah.
with the silly hats and long dresses and the beads.
And those stupid beads.
But at least it's not pretentious like Eugenie.
any figure whatsoever.
And people doing the Charleston.
Yeah.
Pity they can't record video  on this  it would be quite amusing.
Be Bertie Wooster keeps getting accidentally engaged to.
Yeah .
Mm.
Oh I really like this, can I look?
Yeah sure.
She says she's sorry it's predictable  and stereotyped.
But then so is Ann.
It's an icon.
That is, mister I'm an incredibly boring guy.
And I can't 
Have you done any of that  essay yet?
No not yet.
Good.
I, I hate the way you do essays  
How are you?
Have you had a reply from the  yet?
What?
Have you had a reply from the  yet?
No.
He's probably getting them all in  and then sending out all the replies, just speak into that.
Well what is this?
Don't fondle  
Don't fondle it  talk to it .
Well what is it?
Just talk.
Oh that's sweet isn't it?
Yes everyone's been saying  it's sweet .
But would you be recorded on it  
What are you what are you recording?
I'm not, it's Simmone's.
Yes but when the microphone's there do we really talk like in everyday conversations?
We say silly things like  hello Mr microphone.
Another twelve days till I get my canoe.
No but you don't when you don't realize it's recording, you  
Why is Vicky killing you in twelve days?
No
Oh

Oh right.
days.
Zoey was 
What?
She's ordered it you see
Ah
and it was meant to come in two weeks.
Did you get  in the canoe exhibition?
Yes I got a buoyancy aid in the puddle.
I got a very good deal on the buoyancy aid.
They're seventy six quid new, I paid thirty five for mine.
Is it new?
Is it new or secondhand?
It's new but it's old colours, it's old stock
Ah.
and so this guy was selling it for forty, Vicky ordered her canoe there and he was quite a young man  and  so  alright she said hi big boy how about letting me have it for thirty five   if you're willing to ha are you willing to haggle  I mean my friend did buy a whole canoe  he sort of 
Oh yes  she didn't buy half a canoe .
he sort of smiled and said oh okay I'll let you have it for thirty five and I said done.
Ah!
So that was quite good.
 
No not really.
Well  there you go.
Star Trek tonight 
Ooh  
brother turning up apparently.
Who?
brother 
Yes, precisely.
And it's Morse tonight, brand new series.
Oh at least it's a new series, I hate all the old ones.
Yeah, I don't like the repeats cos I can vaguely remember who did it.
You know what 
You know who did it.
you can vaguely remember who did them, mm.
But not quite and it's really annoying.
This is the one where Morse's ex  turns up.
His what?
Morse's ex .
But we still don't find out what his first name is.
No.
It begins with E and that's about all we know.
Does it?
Emille.
No that's too that's not English enough.
How do you know it begins with E?
Eric.
Oh  the half a bee 
Alex is 
Eric.

Oh it's something 
carnally semi-carnally  Cyril Connolly?
No semi- carnally, Cyril Connolly  
Yeah I can't do that bit either.
I can whistle it occasionally.
irritating length.
Oh I've got loads of things 
It is.
that are an irritating  
But the one album I've ever had that isn't an irritating  is   it's, each side of that tape is forty five minutes long and you can fit it, apart from about  er right at the very end of one song you can fit the whole album on a C ninety.
How's that for you?
If you reduced the spacing you could probably even fit the end of that song on.
Yeah.
is good because each side of that is about half an hour
a weird tape actually 
I didn't know any of the songs except oh have you heard that Mr  's become a nun?
Not a nun a monk.
What?
What ?
Oh yes I heard that.
This came from the sixth form.
Oh well it's co probably complete and utter bollocks.
I know he was interested in monastic architecture but  what a load of bollocks.
What?
Mr  has become a monk.
Jesus !
What a load of bollocks.
I wouldn't put it past him actually .
Who told you that   
Erm Carole  in the sixth form.
Well she's meant to be a real bitch anyway.
Yes she is.
So 
I told them you can bitch about  found somebody at last.
Ah yes we can bitch about 
Mr  and his flat cap and his cravat.
I think he must be gay, I mean going into a monastery and not having anything to do with women and wearing a cravat  
monastic a architecture
I can't say that.
Architecture.
Architecture.
Architecture.
He's a complete  
Wanker.
Yes.
It's a pity you can't see hand signals on this thing.
They're a lot more expressive than words.
What are?
Gestures.
Sometimes.
Or body language  
Tt mm he's colour blind as well.
Yeah.
Is he?
Oh look at these lovely blue flowers.
And what colour were they, pink?
Red or pink or something, I wasn't there but

That's very good.
Excellent.

Most resplendent.

These are the ones that fall apart when  
Do you know I, one  one episode of the Star Trek, the new Star Trek they spend million dollars.
 
It takes them, and you know the one where you have the, the ship, it's travelling through space
A million dollars just for Wesley's  
  
well ha you, what you have is you have erm the ship, first of all you have the ship, it's a plain ship on a white background, then you have the lights on a black background and then you have that blue bit in the middle but it takes three shots
What are you talking about?
to get that ship that's moving.
Oh God!
But it ta 
What?

There's no-one else  
Who is playing?
Me.
