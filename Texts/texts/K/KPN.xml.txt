which goes across  according to attainment targets.
Now to help you with that  I'd like it back  I've put the attainment targets 
Bloody hell!
Oh God!
for stage one on here so it can just  go across them.
Okay?


Now, this activity though, I, I'm going to ask you report it back so that each group reports to me 
Well Cathi , how you gonna
with the activity  now then I shall 
 
be able to say to you  which I'll have to say next term when I go in to do my  inspections, I'll have to say to the teacher  er, one 
Oh we should actually have 
what 
our training.
attainment targets are yo , you know what programmes of study are you addressing in this lesson?
And it's gotta be specific.
And two, I will say, how can you, with activity, can you tell me what a level two child should be doing?
Or  what's the difference in this activity for a level two or a level three child?
Okay?
Now that's not quite so easy.
It's damn difficult.
Well, to help you with that  to give you an idea, first I'll the ta the attainment on this one, what to look for.
And this is how 
  
parts of these statements have been translated.
Don't go into the, this morning when she was doing activity  she said ah, she said I I've got them to spot ten similarities, ten differences, great!
Okay.
But it's not good teaching.
And I said, fine.
I said, so how many of those would grade three, level three child have to get to be at a level three?
And how many of those would a level two child have to get?
And how many would the level one child have to get?
Then you can make it into an easier idea of what I mean.
But, when you're doing that  you make assessment at the end of it to say what level you have, you've got to target specifically at certain things.
It means a bit of cheating , will give you some idea of how they, at level one, on a picture a child, you'd expect a child to pick out  two things about buildings.
Okay?
Or if you were doing water  they could pick out two of the four things that you wanted about water.
So when you're doing this  bear that in mind.
Okay?
I'll try and do a little bit more here  fine, but it's really thinking 
Improvisation is the word.
of  
I know the .
Okay?
 

I'm sorry, I've forgot a little aid for you.
Erm, I have  one job here  two pages on the  area  and if you look at it it gives you a progression from  sort of pre-school life, nursery activity, right through to  what will  what will be level ten.
I still feel Lyndsey can deal with that one.
Right?
So I'll leave you with 
 
an example 
Mm.
which gives you some suggestions of what .
 



Yeah that's fine.
Ha!
Well let's all take one of her things she's giving.
I know.
. Where are you for teaching practice?
Er erm  Saffron Junction.
Oh oh!
Just down the road from here.


Yeah, right Ange.
Yeah right.
Do you want me to start or what?
No, no, no, no.
So
Look, that's wha , what th that's what we've got in our  I mean
So are we planning for five weeks or  planning for five lessons or what?
Five weeks of work.
Five weeks.
Well, what we wanna do is do one, do week by week and then split it up into  day by day.
Yeah.
Like that's your  
Yeah you need to work , go back.
Erm  I was gonna say  yes.
So it was a waste of time?
Honestly , on my life, there were twenty masks
And th , good masks?
Glass cabinets, yeah they were really good, but, that was it, no information, nothing.
Apart from a price list, so we had a price list, and I thought right  so I went to a book shop  and I tried to find a book on masks  nothing.
Apart from this book that was thirty pounds, it had two pages in it.
Oh my God!
Dunno what I'm gonna do.
I really don't know what I'm gonna do.
Go the library.
Yeah, I've been and there's none there either.
Well like  go to your brother's and have a look.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go there.
I'm planning to lo , I'm just gonna, we'll go, yeah I'm even gonna go to a book shop
Mm.
and get one.
Gotta find one.
Honestly, I've gotta headache.
Why?
I think I'm exhausted or hung over.
I had  I'm getting that way tomorrow night!
I woke up, last night  and Mark had had a really bad dream he was crying his eyes out.
Why?
I don't understand sometimes, like with nightmares, but like I can't seem to remember them and I left .
Ah ah ah!
But I just think I must have had 
Stress.
a really bad nightmare.
When I'm stressed I get really bad nightmares.
Yeah.
Well I've just had really bad night's sleep.
Yeah.
Mind you
That's probably why.
Matthew just made me laugh cos he said like  
So what did Matthew say then?
He just said girls are completely different from, from boys.
It's true , I  honestly, I've heard that said, er said 
I've heard that when we were going shopping tonight, they said to me  before I'd even  
Mm.
It is, isn't it?
I suppose that's what, what it  erm  honestly male  male company's 
I know.
better to be honest.
Yeah.
It really is.
Cos males, what they do if they have an argument  they'll punch it out and then 
Punch, yeah.
they'll be best friends after.
Or er , or they say fuck off and forget about it.
It's freezing in here.
No.
Cra , they're crafty 
It's freezing in my own house, but
I'm not cold at all.
could you find that warm duvet to keep me warm.
It's nice in there.

No, well, I know, I think that won't last very long  somehow.
Don't you?
No.
Well I mean 
Are you shocked Mum?
I was really going to do it, honest.
No I couldn't think
So, Helen and Si!
Er
What shall you do with me?
Oh my lady .
Shut the window.
Shut me in the .
Hit me with your rhythm stick .
Hit me hard and hit me quick.
Oh it's six o'clock isn't it?
What?
It's six o'clock.
What's six o'clock?
It's half six.
Oh half six.
That's it.
Yeah.
That's what it says on his little card.
Yes.
Because he was going to sort of like  
Milk up  Nicola didn't believe me when I told her.
She thought I was playing a joke.
What?
When I told her  about this.
Didn't she?
I goes er  oh, I'm recording it for this thing and she goes, oh yeah my big head!
I goes, I am !
But she didn't believe me.
Can I have some sauce please?
There was na , definitely no chance of a walk that day.
But of Jane Eyre there for you.


Whoops!
What a culinary delight this is.
Mm mm.
Indeed.
What?
Indeed.
Indeed.
What exciting lessons did you have today then?
Nothing too exciting.
Well I had  er er er er, oh, what did I have?
Something, P E  maths  English and graphics.
Science, maths, English and graphics.
How come she's so in , you're so interested in  the eleven plus and  everything?
Well we were having a discussion about erm  whether it should be brought back.
Mm mm.
I said definitely not.
Cos it makes rejects of people in society.
And everyone went, what!


As they all do in my class.
Cos they're all thick!
I couldn't believe it right
Well they've all supposedly got intelligent parents by the thi , sound of them.
Well not all of them.
I was sat, I, I was sat there 
Not all thick like me.
I was sat there, and they went who's planning to go onto University or education after eighteen?
So I put up my hand, turned round  and flipping Stuart and Danny had put their hands up and I just went, oh God!
They're gonna 
 
do really well!
And Terry, total Terry.
Terry, who hasn't got a brain cell to rub together.
Well you mo , he's in your class isn't he?
So?
Ah!
That boy!
This is the one who said  I think we should be allowed to hit girls.


He's


he, two short planks does not describe this boy.


Even Miss hates him.
Now, well you see, she o , we was having this discussion about education and she goes, are you cynical about education Terry?
He goes  no.
She goes   ooh!
She goes, why?
And he goes, I don't know what cynical means.
  
I was saying, ah no!
And everyone in the class just cracked up.
Sometimes you woth er,whe , you wonder whether he does it on purpose.
He must do it on purpose, no one could be that thick.
How many was thinking of going on?
Ninety five percent.
Oh.
Yeah.
But erm  like Vicky who's got  in her English folder  this is Vicky, you know Vicky  she's got  in her literature she's got nine A's and one B.
And in her other, I don't know what she's got, ten A's probably.
And  she's not going to.
She wants to be a nurse.
Oh does she?
And er  like she said, aren't you Vicky?
And she goes no Miss.
Erm, you can't be a nurse till you're eighteen.
No.
No, you can't go in as a stu er, student.
So like  you know, she's gonna stay on  do A levels  and then go into it.
Mm mm.
Because  she might as well have some A levels just in case or whatever.
But erm  you know, ah  you know, she's, you know  I can understand that actually, she's being quite sensible about it, she said, there's nothing else I wanna do  and I might as well do something I enjoy.
You know, you've only got one life haven't you, when you comes down to it?
Well if that's what she wants to do, that's what she wants to do innit?
Mm.
Like, her Dad said to her, why don't you be a doctor?
And she ju , but she don't want to.
You know, she wants to be in a hospital
Yeah.
like, she don't want to end up in general practice.
Well sh , doesn't necessarily have to end up in general practice does she?
No, but 
Well I mean for the first year she won't be in  if she goes in as a student she'll be in college.
I know, but  it won't take as long for her to get  there   as it will  if she becomes a doctor.
Oh no.
Three years int it, a student?
Mm.
But then you get on-hand experience from it.
Hands on I should say, not on-hand.
But er
Learning how to clean pot er er, bed pans and  make beds and  things like that.
Clearing up sick.
Mhm.
That's her favourite job isn't it?
Mm mm.
You know, I thought of being that once but  I wouldn't mind it in the wards, but I wouldn't wanna be in the operating theatre.
I don't know why.
See, blood don't put me off or anything, but
You don't have to go into the theatre for so long I think.
Mm mm.
But then you can sa , you can specialize you see.
I mean, some nurses go into the theatre all the time once they've qualified, so 
Yeah.
I think that they'll have to go in  you'll have to go into each area.
But like  I mean, I don't mind the blood or whatever, and if they were doing little things  I  could handle it   but like, like on that op op , operation that woman was having the other day  and they cut her open and they just pulled.
Well they do.
And that,tha , that's the thing that makes me red, it's not the cutting  it's when they just pull it apart  and it like 
Well who's gonna know?
rips.
Urgh!
Urgh!
They could have cut it.
Well they do cut it.
No they cut the skin and then they just pulled it apart.
Yeah, because it's not th , not like that underneath.
They, they didn't pull it apart they, they cut down  if they cut down with a knife then they could cut into something couldn't they?
Ooh! oop!
It could be dangerous.
Say you, you open up the top and then the others parts.
The lining.
Urgh!
Urgh!
Yeah but what they ripped was all fat!
All her 
Well 
fat!
Ooh ooh!
Yeah, but you see you've got the, you've got all the, the other things ins , down, down it, underneath, and I mean if you started going in with a knife and you started cutting down, I mean you could sa , cut an artery or  anything couldn't you?
Which could be a bit nasty.
You know.
Hello pussycat!
Buy a little bag for me.
A chick a chick a chick a chicken  .
Hello my .
Ooh!
Whose turn is it tonight?
Mine.
Good.
Well   and if it was David's  the poor dog'd never get taken.

You should get one of them.
I told him I wanted one with a self-timer on it.
Get, my camera it's really good.
How much was it?

Ooh!
A couple of  very important announcements first of all.
Erm   books are .
Er erm  is therefore  if I can take it out
Oh!
er erm  well, I know when it is, Thursday the eleventh of November, it's a matinee performance  so it starts at two o'clock.
Okay?
Thursday the eleventh of November, matinee performance, starting at two o'clock  and the tickets are five pounds.
So that's the cheapest we can get.
And then 
That's reading week isn't it?
No 
Sorry?
it's the 
it's er 
week after.
Oh!
The week after.
So .
I won't do it on a reading week, I'll do it 
Thursday the eleventh.

Thursday the eleventh of November?
Well, reading week's the first weekend.
Oh.
Okay, Thursday the eleventh.
To catch it, if you want to come you've gotta get a fiver, to me, with your name, by two o'clock tomorrow afternoon cos that's when I have to confirm the booking.
If you want to come, get five pounds to me with your name and  number.
Right, we'll have the
it's a two o'clock  matinee.
Mm?
Thursday the eleventh 
Yeah.

I probably, won't be able to go.

I er well
Probably not, I dunno.
Thursday afternoon's a good  time 
 
cos it clashes with Geography and English Studies.
Yeah.
Oh alright.
Yeah.
And we will be doing that.
We'll have to bunk off.
You might miss .
Yes.

Okay Marion.
I'll have yours as well instead 
Mm.
after that.
Erm, I haven't bought as many tickets as there are people in my two seminar groups
Oh right.
cos I'm assuming that there are some people who  when it actually comes to the crunch 
 
don't want to go, and there's some who won't be able to go due to other commitments.
But  that means that spaces might actually be erm
Oh!
Limited.
li , limited, is that the word I'm looking for?


Limited, I think.


Right, well I think  erm  right.
Got that.
Where is it gonna be, sorry?
It's gonna be Bath.
Erm, the Royal Shakespeare Company production.
Ah!
I saw it on the thing actually, yeah.
Erm  I wanted to actually arrange a coach if there's enough people sort of please arrange a coach, could do, but  I reckon it's probably easier to go up   
By train.
don't you?
Mm mm.
Er er, on the train.
Even if it was the day we'd be sort of coming back
Get the traffic.
in the rush hour.
Yeah.
Mm?
So that again, talk about
Sorry?
Erm, I never asked er, any B A Q T S course?
Okay.
Listen up, this is important.
It has been decided  the powers that be, are onto the something  that  you are going to do your first semester exam in June.
Oh what!
Not the semester 
Shit!
just been.
Okay?
What's that?
It will not be the same paper needless to say.
 
 
When was ?
February.
Why's 
Okay?
that then I wonder?
Why is that?
Is there any reason?
Erm  no, this was told to me, I presume this was discussed as some sort of  
 

No it's not.
We do the exams the week before, er before.
Erm
Yeah.
well I suppose we won't have enough time to prepare for teachers though.
No.
The teaching's far more important than English obviously.
It came, the decision came from  your  the education department.
Yes, well, another cock-up 
Er er, the English department.
there.
Are they for  or second years?
The exams  on first semester work  is June.
Okay.
That's enough of that.
So by the time we sit our exam we'll have forgotten al , what we've done?
Yeah you'll have re-read all of it.
Great!
Ha ha!
Super!
Bloody hell!
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I thought I was gonna go, go home early at the end of the second semester cos I'd have my exams.
Oh oh.
You were wrong!
Right.
Can we turn to tho that work sheet please?
And, as, I, I know the people who were here last week, the questions for act one  scene one or two will be relevant to the second part of the seminar, it will be, but we'll ignore them at the moment.
So, go straight onto act two, scene three.
Okay.
Er erm  first question there.
What do we learn about the opening, the opening and closing scenes  of the two acts?


Anything?
Er er
Does it say that?


Erm  er er, what would you learn from them?
Right.
And what we learn about them .
Yeah.
Okay.
So, he's  he's thoroughly mad by this stage and er, he  er obsessed with Mrs  from .
Er erm  does anybody spot any of the progression in the speech?
From  where he starts  to where he ends?
Does he go through any ?
Feel sorry for Saffron  's son.
Mm.
Yes.
Although he still believes that what he's done is right, that er  that his wife has se deserves what she's got.
That's my  er  well    er illness
