Yeah.

and it doesn't do any harm for a short distance but er
She got, so she get to nearly to her friends and she realised that the  she'd left the clutch on.
Anyway, so it's not that.
But she couldn't get the car started this morning.
So hasn't she been to college today then?
Yeah , she'd been to college but she couldn't get her car started, she had to get her dad to drive her in  and pick her up.
And erm 
Is she not coming tonight.
Well she's not coming on Sunday is she, because of the 
No I said er  and she said, I'm ever so sorry!
I said it's okay I just erm  you know, I don't  I'll probably, I'm fine on my own, I've got things to do and I can watch T V and I 
Mm.
can, and she said, oh alright then, if you're sure?
And she went  how are you?
I'm fine.
She said, you don't sound fine.
I said I'm feeling fine thanks honestly!
Aargh!
Mm!
I just don't want to be treated like, you know, object of pity  or something !
You're rare because of the way
Ee!

Right.
Have you heated the beans up?
Ooh no.
Are we having tea with this?
Ooh yes!
Make some tea.
Is it, is this a  oh no.
Anyway  so er  that's what she said.
And she said er, what about Sunday?
I said, well, I really feel I can  lead my own company  section, I forgot Andrea was coming.
She said, well alright then.
She said, how about Ritzi's on Monday?
I said, oh I don't think I could cope with that!
I don't feel like it anyway.
Well  doesn't it ma , I mean when you do you'll be  away with your different groups' points and he'll be
Makes me angry cos it's, you know  just
A waste.
without energy.
But 
well 
erm  oh no, just sort of like, and like he's being like, so considerate now!
And he's like saying, how are you feeling and all that?
I thought, well he could have done it 
Should have said er   well I think you should go and phone Joe in the morning.
No.
But you know, I felt like saying, well, you know  he could have been a bit more considerate and concerned when we were actually going out with each other!
Well it's better to feel than never have felt at all isn't it?
To me, he's an emotional cripple!
As well as being a bloody idiot to you!
That was more he said.
Was it?
And what did you sa , what did you just say?
He's o , like your dad said all through his life   the other way around .
such into the shadows.
Yes.
You've got to miss the shadow for the po 
But he's just a bit irritating cos he  well  you know  I do , I don't understand how you go through a whole relationship and everything, and then come to end of it and not even feel the slightest bit
Well he probably does but he, obviously he's
Horrible!
.
Oh well, you know   er we're talking him and she says er  something about  I said  er  ooh you know, he's hardly ever cried since you got, he says,Mm!
That's what he says!
Course, men can't cry can they?
She said, I mean, she says I'm not prejudiced here, and she says there's obvious exceptions and they're not bad  but the majority of them are a waste of time!
She's given up smoking and casual sex  now .
Well I can   perhaps it's
No, she says not, she says not all men but she says a lot of them have inbred to them that they can't cry and  and all that.
Well it's a macho thing, you know.
Mm.
It isn't manly to 
She said that.
to cry.
I think we shall have to start.
How come bought these mini Snickers for there?

Maybe  it might be an idea to get a deep fat fryer somewhere.
You ask Steven, I I can't.
Steven knows what his parents want.
You always put a deep fat fryer because
Well, I've got to replace that soon.
They cost about fifteen pounds.

Oh that's a good idea!
Ta.
Mum would like that.
Gerald's mum's got a deep fat fryer, let you borrow that first see how th , ah, what they're like.

Well  I rung up Mrs , she said well  she would do them, but Vivien was coming, and Dave so she'd rather not .
So I thought, ooh Brenda asked her.
Oh Mrs , she said she'd be, she would do them but she'd felt  absolutely terrified at the prospect because she had a  a few years ago cos Gerry never had trousers with turn ups.




Now he's a big boy!
But she would worry about them.
I mean, she would turn them up, she would worry.
So I thought, well I can't really ask her.
I know how she's feels, like .
So I says, if we gotta get back to her  cos I went to Margaret's funeral .
Mm!
Yes.
Derek said  how's Elizabeth?
I said, she's alright, but  it wasn't the ordeal  that she thought it was going to be.
He said, well she did .
And what did you say then?
Goodbye.
Mm.
So , saw  today, Coleen came up to me.

She says, how how's Elizabeth ?
He said well, erm, or something about reunions and  told her.

Why di , why did you finish?

Mm?
I need to know.
I think the main part will be alright cos you'll be travelling down the A thirty four which is erm
Good anyway.
He's better off 
It's horrible!
to go by train.
In actual fact, that car of his being light, I mean a front wheel drive will probably be able to  and being light  probably be  better served for getting out of difficult situations than the other cars.
I'm gonna swap, Maurice, Maurice  's got a Citroen.
Mm.
Yeah.

Burgundy and  cream one.

I said I'm okay.
You look good or something.
And then  that was it really.
He chatted to Louise did he?
Yeah.
Why break the habit of the lifetime eh?


Did he?
What's wrong?
Cracking!
Maybe he didn't .
Maybe.
Erm, and he spoke to me later, a bit later, we had a row.
God!
Yeah.
And then I sa , saw him at break.
So he, when he came in he could of gone round that way and talked to you, or gone round that way and talked to Louise?
I suppose so.
It's a bit awkward though, I mean
Yeah.
It is really.
didn't really know how to act.
Well didn't like Louise tie him down?


I know.
Oh she stunk!
She really did!
She could do .
You know when grandma says it gets in the pores?
It does.
I like garlic but not in that .
I could look at that, at you all day.
I mean, she keeps going through that phase.
Has Catherine told you when she met Mary?
Yes she has hasn't she?
Mary?
Mary .
That's right, yeah.
After granddad's funeral
Mm mm?

Well vaguely.
Well
Who's got the horrible children?

But they 
You don't have chips and sausage and that kind of thing.
They se , they they, they them things 
I don't, I mean we don't have them much but  do we really?
No.
I  but I think, a bit, it's a bit too fatty for me.
It's a bit too fatty for me actually.
Anyway, I do think we should rethink the deep fat fryer.
I think we should have a healthier lifestyle.
Well if you re , it's actually good I think you wanna stop it really.
Aha.
That looks revolting!
Look at the mess that's made there!
You need to take the lid off.
Look at  that's egg.

Thank you.
Thanks.
Alright.
I'm gonna .
Got you one of those bone  erm,one.
Are they bone?
Well  plastic.
Plastic!
Oh!
Plasticey .
Did you have that when you were married?
Mm.
I feel quite sick now!
I do.
That's why I had an apple..
Did you fly, Fry and Laurie last night?
No.
Oh it was good.
Never have a lesson with them!
So much  
It only helps at lessons.
No I'm only kidding!
Oh yeah!
Found they probably .
Oh yes!
That was the one!
I didn't see that one .
Well, it was, they had this son, this this young lad came  erm  Stephen Fry was playing part of the  the fa 
Is that the hippy?
No!
Sorry!
He asks you something and then when you start to 
Sorry!
Sorry dad.
so he was playing the father you see, and he asks his son to come into the study, and he said, but you do realise so , er that the  Hugh Laurie is the son of his, you do realise that you were adopted?
And he said, yes he did and .
Erm  some,i i , something about a pen knife wasn't it?
And
This is a talisman of  Rabbara and things like this !
 
So he went, he went to .
You're to go to Saffron Walden and then you're supposed to make friends and all this sort of, and he went through all this for about five minutes and this lad
The wise man of the , fish!
So he goes out and th and his wife comes in and she's  how did he take it?
He goes  oh well, yes I think
I think it worked cos I really 
I think 
like  bugger off!
 
 
I think it , like it worked, he said  let the lying little sod  or something !
Can I have a bit of your apple please?
Not just a whole one cos I don't want one.
Thank you mum.
Saw the bit where, it's got like  tha that where he's been, he said, I think it's because  I had the, I smoked pot  or something, marijuana once then I got    I got busted or something  and !
Yes.
Oh!
Could feed a large family on that chip for a week  down in  Ethiopia!


You know that erm  and of the famine in Ethiopia, and they reckon it's gonna kill even more than the one ninety eighty four did.
Yes!
They're all too complacent that's their trouble!
The only thing is, at least the civil war is finished so er,wo once they get their distribution problem sorted out they reckon, sort of 
Erm, we're doing all about this in er E D S the other day  and apparently  from the pictures on the T V at the time everyone thought it was whole of Ethiopia that was starving, and it was only actually twenty five percent of the population.
Because some of the areas are quite prosperous and they've got good farmland.
They reckon  have got the cows on there.
No, that's the rain forest.
And erm  she bought in all these pictures of erm  like, Ethiopia  like the prosperous parts.
Yes but the twenty five percent  what they show, is pretty horrific wasn't it?
Yeah , it was, and th erm  but it's just saying it's not like that.
And whe they  you see, some people are trying to get the opinions of Ethiopia changed, cos like everyone seems to pity them and  really, they should accept them and try and help them, but try and help them on, like equal terms.
Mm.
I mean, there's er Sudan who  and other parts of Africa, and Bangladesh they've got er  horrendous problems which are equally as bad!
Yeah, because we're planning on shifting out .


Well, you got your evening mapped our  fairly well have you ?
I'm not  pessimistic about .
Well they haven't.
I mean, all the, all the respect 
Well
As I say, it's it's from the  to have respectability.
But you know erm  the, media at the time, you know there's a pic , there was a picture of the time of a baby who was starving and screaming.
Yeah.
Mm.
Well, they would have showed a wider picture of the actual picture, and apparently they take,co , the photographers had taken a baby away from it's mother  he's standing in the middle of a desert , and there's a picture of them with a baby and all these photographers  photographing it !
Sounds a bit like that baby  !
Yeah.!


Oh he'll be splattered by a  in Doncaster !

with Ben Elton!
Is that granddad's watch?
Yeah.
I put a brand new strap, but the new strap was too dark for me.
Too tight across the shoulders so I'm gonna have to 
Got me a large strap for it.

It'll be a case of 
Just the
I tell you what .
But I  er i , if you like, I can pay the thirty pounds and then that'll make us equal.
Well let's have a think.

Do you know what she did?
Yeah.
Oh!
She's made a big parcel up in the
You don't honestly think that I couldn't help

I haven't got any, they wo , I couldn't get any fresh parsley so I thought that might just give it a bit of colour, but I've got dried parsley if you'd rather use that.
