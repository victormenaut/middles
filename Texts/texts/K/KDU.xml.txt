Good morning Carol, how are you this morning?
Well a bit wet and windy
Oh, well it's dry and very cold and er and bright periods
Is it?
er but no doubt we'll have a few showers I'm sure
Yeah, we've had really heavy rain this end and it's beginning to dry up, but it's still very strong winds
Yeah
we've been told to prepare for frost tonight
Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me because it's quite, quite cold here
Well I believe it's snowing in Coventry
That wouldn't surprise me one bit
Mm, anyway what can we do for you?
Well I tell you what I'm on about, er, Penn Eagle, er, it the code, the A F P number is 
Yes
if you may or may not remember we were able to buy the D U S from Holland on it 
Yeah yeah I think we did yeah 
Yeah , does that mean er whenever I send out the application fee of two hundred and fifty pounds some months ago, er did we get that back or do we get it back?
No you don't get that back
That's 
that's all part of the administration procedures
that's what I thought, I wasn't quite sure, I just wanted I'd been sort of going through various things, and I want I'd wanted to make absolutely sure
No because erm, I mean, you've paid a hundred and forty pounds in the post
Correct 
out of seven hundred pounds for testing each year
Yeah, that's fine, I just wanted to confirm that that was okay
That's okay
It's one of those things that sort of sort of puts a little query in your mind and 
You have a blind sometimes don't you?
And
 
I, er,un unfortunately I have too many of them  
 
but someday you'll be old too Carol, so
I'm getting that way now
 
 
Well that's grand, and okay
Have a nice Easter
Thank you ver and the same to yourself, yes indeed, thank you very much indeed
Bye bye
Bye bye 
Good morning Sam  speaking, er, is Phillip there please?
Just a moment
Thank you 
Morning
Good morning Phillip sorry I didn't get back to you sooner
That's alright, just about the group conference
Yeah
I'm not flying up, I'm driving up
Alright, okay
erm, I can be there two days, two and a half days beforehand
Ah right, you're doing a wee tour
That's right
Right
erm and as far as, erm menus and everything is concerned
Right
don't worry about something for me I'll have what anybody else has
Ooh right, okay, well there'll be another one going out to you for the, I think the Saturday night er hotel
Don't worry about it, I'll just have what er, what's going
Er, oh yes well I think it, I think bearing in mind the size of the hotels, I think probably it would be a help if there was something sort of decided, but I, I know, I'm, I'm a wee bit sort of, possibly like yourself, er I might order something now  and then  not look forward to it that particular night
Yeah
wished I'd booked something else, er but I'm leaving it sort of, you know, sort of three, four days maybe before we depart
Right
so er, I'll be in touch er Phillip no doubt, er once you get the second menu there'll be another one coming along I think
Yeah
er from the other hotel, I've been promised that anyway.
Right, fine.
Er, how are things there today?
They're a little bit faded today, we're all in today, which makes it a little bit easier.
Ah right, right.
How's trade?
Still going along, still going along
Good, good
but er
ground still wet is it?
We've had a lot, a nice drop of rain
Right
nice drop of rain
Yeah
erm, you know which is, we've had more rain in the last fortnight than we have for about in the last three years.
Good God, yes I know it's been very, very heavy here too, there were certain areas over here certainly needed a bit of rain, but now there's  certainly didn't need it at all 
Yeah
but it's erm, och it's ticking along the trade you know, but er if, it's bitterly cold here, I don't know what it's like with you at the moment?
It's not particularly warm Sam
Yeah
erm, I, I think it, because it has been warm, then you feel it when it becomes cold again, don't you?
Yes that, I think that's possibly true, er, I was talking to Cambridge there about oh fifteen, twenty minutes ago and they said it was raining with them, and then they'd been talking over to somebody over in Coventry and it's, it's snowing there  
 
and it wouldn't surprise me one bit, because it, as I say it's bitterly cold here, while it's dry at the moment, it's bitterly cold
Yeah
so there we are, nothing else strange or startling?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Good, okay, okay Phillip, er 
Can you can you transfer me to Ruby or are you on your
 
I can, yes just one second
Thank you 
hold on a wee second here, just one second, where's Ruby's number?
Here we are, okay, cutting off now.
Cheers 
Hello Phillip
Yep
suddenly remembered er Ruby's off today
Okay
is there anybody else?
No it's okay, it'll wait till tomorrow
Okay, fine 
Okay then 
all the best
Thank you, thanks for ringing, bye

This is a fax to Teagasc T E A G A S C see in  er for the attention of Doctor Vincent  and head it air freight charges on Aaron.
Good morning Vincent, I'm enclosing copies of faxes received this morning from New Zealand, and certainly the rate quoted is more realistic, then drop down a line and put eighteen by two point nine five pounds, oblique kilo, equals fifty three pounds, ten pence, next line documentation, twenty pounds, next line customs clearance etcetera, thirteen New Zealand dollars, I'd say Irish pounds, three point three, O, O equals nine pounds approximately and total it up, eighty two pounds, ten pence  which is approximately a third less  as you see David     suggests you lean heavily on Air Lingus and point out at the same time that Challenge Seeds have no intention of paying this exorbitant rate, also what is a consolidation rate?
It seems to cover a multitude of sins.
Look forward to hearing from you, best regards, Sam.
Hello Sam
I, I want to talk to you about er the conversation I had with Alec  yesterday, he seems to be inundated with having to get details about  on his er, all his paperwork and so on, and he seems to be inundated and he sounded a bit low, quite frankly, to me yesterday on the phone that he was getting inundated with all this
Mm, mm
work.
I said I'm quite sure there must be something that could be done computer-wise
Right 
but he sort of pooh-poohed it and sort of said well you know, we're getting a bit to old for all this modern sophistication of computers and so on, well I said well quite frankly I am not totally in agreement with you, because as you probably know Clyde  was looking into a program which will could alleviate a lot 
Yes I know, I know 
of the work, that I do, but I 
yes it's on the  
would tell you right here and now, er I'm still retaining my bible you know the book 
Yeah, yes, yes 
that I have downstairs, because it's, if it was to be computerized, it would be a massive great bloody great volume
Yes
and I would be carrying this around and it just wouldn't be feasible 
Quite, right 
so he said that apparently whenever he came back to B S H he was told by Neville roughly about eighteen hundred acres would be sort of his target 
Target, right 
and it's, it's multiplied by about three or four times that you see 
Oh right, right, right 
so consequently he's getting inundated, he really is apparently under pressure 
Mm, mm, right 
so this is why I raised the very conversation about it 
Right, right 
and er, I said well look I'll have a word with the erm, with and see if he can think of anything that might
Yes alleviate the point 
all things in mind that are possible on er, on er, on er computer, and he said that he hadn't much time to think about it and said well look, maybe over Easter
Mm
put down on a piece of paper what essentials you want done
Right
and what things that you're liable to get asked
Right, mm, mm
so he's going to do that, so I said well look, do you mind if I had a wee sort of prelim talk with him 
Right 
see if, if it's a possibility
Right
What he's looking for is certified numbers, field numbers
That sort of 
all this sort of information 
right, well the, the, well there's good news on that front because in our, in the actual new version of the seeds package which we have now 
Yeah 
erm developed and it's gonna be released in the next few months
Right
there is er, a very complex and detailed er section for a  
oh 
and indeed keeping the history of fields and so on 
Right oh I see 
in that  and I know Alec has seen the previous version of this package
Right
and er it was certainly er then, a very primitive
Yeah, yeah
erm package and it has been developed now to quite, quite a high level of sophistication
Oh good
Now that certainly should cater for all his requirements, the only problem that Alec will have to go through now, is that actually get all this information 
Yes, right 
keyed into the system
Yeah, yeah
erm and since the volume has increased quite dramatically
Yeah
he's heavenly gonna need outside help to do this
Well that's when I said to him, I said have you any outside help, and he said well really, no
It's just him
it's him
I, you see that, that, that, initially he is gonna have a problem 
You see he's so  
Yeah
and then he's coming back to this mass of work
He has to get it done
and er, and, and, he feels look, well I'm caring with it now but some time
Mm
four eyes, as he calls it, is gonna get
Uptight about it, yeah
No, no, he, he'll, well, no Alec is going to get uptight about it 
Yes, yeah 
and the last person I want to see leaving is Alec 
Would be Alec absolutely
cos I  
I think what he needs to do er is to say right, well there's a problem here, go to Netherlands Alec, they need help here to get things set up
That's right
because I'm ab I'm absolutely convinced having seen the package
Yeah
erm Sam, it does produce er you know tremendous information 
Yeah 
and it's easily updated because er from what I've seen now you can actually key in sort of the acreage and then update the crop inspecting reports 
Right 
and each time you go out and look at the crop update 
Right 
that very, very easily
Oh I see
and print out a variety of reports on that
Yeah
and then erm it will as you go along, as the crops are actually growing in the fields, you can change the yield on it so as 
Oh, aye 
as, as it gets near to the harvest you can come to 
Yeah, yeah 
quite a close estimate of what the 
Estimate, yes, yes 
the harvest is gonna be 
Oh that's excellent because er I said, he said oh I don't want to be lugged with a big computer sort of thing and so on, so I said well you might, you might be able to get 
It's 
a little portable thing that can 
Yeah 
go out with you and you, you can push a button and it'll come 
 
up with a standard form
That's
and click on the informat information that you've got already on it and whenever you come back home, or not, into work, you plug it into the master and it it boots in 
That, that is certainly, you know, it, that can be, and, and it's something which we'll probably look at a wee longer term 
Well what, what sort of made me say that was because er across the  crevy well at least all these travel ones are 
Yes all these little
little manual things, yeah 
hand held terminals, yeah and they go out
Yeah
and they can do all the measurements and the trial grounds and so on 
Right
and then come back in
Right
and push it into the big
and download it into the system
Yeah
Yes that, that's certainly something which I know computer applications 
Well 
are now currently looking at 
must do 
erm, but the one other area which I'm sure Alec would find useful for as well, this new thing, er it's trying to find as many benefits for them 
Yes that's right 
as possible to make it easier for them to set it up, is that we're hoping to develop within the next er few months in fact, a certification form
Oh
system
yes
so in fact what will happen is, they will have all the details about the fields and so on 
Yeah
and then they will be able to generate all the certification forms for the Ministry
Right
so Alice, er what do you call, Alec at the present 
I wonder does Alec 
time, he does all that manually
I wonder does Alec been told about this?
I don't think he may have been told about that, now he himself if he knew about that, that might be sufficient digging him over this hill
That's right, correct
because at the other side of the hill he can see well, life's gonna be a lot easier 
You know Alec er , Alec comes up and informs me and I always say well Alec how are things, urgh, do you want the good news or bad news first  sort of thing  
Yes, so it's not easy, yeah.
No well that's alright, maybe if, er you are talking to him, I don't know whether you do talk to him
Well I don't, Alec's probably er one person who I don't speak to a lot really 
Yeah, right 
because er
If you are
Yes
and you get talking about always see if I am 
Aye mention that, yes 
Aye, aye mention that and say that you 
Yeah 
you have
Mm
possibly something that's coming along in the 
Yeah 
pipeline that would alleviate his problem.
I think it's always the problem Sam where people have used a manual based system for so long
Yeah, that's right
and that the new technology coming in, there is, in the early stages of a lot of 
to you  
work put in to actually set up the system
Yeah
but once they've gone through that pain barrier
Yeah
and got it set up and running
Yes
things then start to taper down again
Right, okay
er, but there is a very steep learning curve 
Yes 
to go through
right
and a lot of people do fight against it, and I, I can understand it er, it's so different to me 
Yeah, well he sort of said oh we're, we're a bit old for this or something, I don't know what Alec is, I thought he was only early forties or something
I think he's probably mid, mid, mid late, mid late forties probably 
could be forty something, mid forties 
mid late forties, yeah
I thought it was rather strange er I admit, but I, I sort of, I think I've got him round
Yes
that he's going to sit down 
Right 
over the, over the, over the holiday period 
holidays and look at it 
and just, is it all you have to do is jot down what you want from the terminal 
Yeah 
or what information you want on this thing and what generally information is asked of you
Mm, mm
from maybe Neville or me or somebody 
No 
cos I mean, that's what prompted all this cos I was getting some information from my 
right
ninety one harvest
So that's it, okay
Well he should have that all on the system
That's grand okay 
Okay 
Sam
thank you very much indeed
Pleasure
Is that two O three one N?
Zanussi two O three one N is correct a Zanussi two O three one N with a remote control 
I tell you what you can find out about them is 
Well I, I, what I'll do is I write off to them, and say what I do is, can't remember where, where we bought it, I think it was Comet
There's no er, no you don't
Comet they're chosen 
they're terrific er
No, well they're closing down
for the, all the more reason they must have a big stock  big stock 
Well right, well then, how long has, how long has that been going?
Er, that's a good question, four or five years, more
Must be more
four years and er, er, oh it must be ten next, ten 
been here eight 
We had it fixed, we had it fixed before Christmas
Mm, mm
and it just went and  we had to get these guys who, who did the washing machine
Right
they were somewhere out in the North Road
Mm, mm
on the North Road
Aha
but they came out  collected the set, we managed to borrow a set from elsewhere
Mm, mm
and it was bloody and erm 
This was at Christmas?
this right at just
oh god
you know?
Yeah
Couldn't of happened at a worse time 
Worse time 
and erm  they had it back within a week  and it cost twenty eight quid 
Oh that wasn't too bad
and they gave a list of what they did
Yeah that wasn't bad was it?
and they cleaned it and everything 
Yeah
and, we must say it was very warm
Yeah, right, oh that's good.
I mean, most is labour and we have to  
 

when you think er
A call out today
a call out
is twenty quid 
twenty quid it's thirty quid here
That's right
Some fella told me that only a couple of weeks ago, but the greatest rip off of them all, have you heard the greatest rip off about Betty and the, and the roof?
Oh yes she did 
Oh 
she told me, I, I felt sorry but er
I told her before, I said he was a con 
I knew, it's so easy 
I said er, you wanna make sure like er 
Get a price 
get a price before he climbs up er is thirty quid okay?
Well he climbed up on the roof and he came down again and whatever he done, there was nothing wrong with the roof for a start
That's right
and then he charged it and er she if, she know, she couldn't do anything but pay him
Mm, mm och oh she was conned
but when he came, he came back 
 
for the money he came back
she told them that, that's mine, she told them that I didn't think much of this and I thought it was a rip off


and he had the nerve to say that is the first time I've ever been said about it 
 
the first time ever
 

he, all he did, he kind of 
Cemented something
No, no he, he unstuck er a drain and then said he did something on the roof
Mm, mm
there was nothing wrong with the roof, the roof was all heavy fixed, for
Mm, oh well we all learn by our mistakes
Yeah, I tell you, even Ian now is very  about paying bills and, and Barry I say hit the roof when he heard that one 
Oh these people that
I don't have people that call at the door, I want somebody I get them
 
That's something, that's something I must 
He did a couple of things on the roof
that's something, but this thing reaches publicity stage, which it could in a couple of weeks time, appear in a paper, you'd have all sorts of weirdos
What, what's this?
cold calling, once they've put the house on the market as such 
 
they start the advertising of the house 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Are they going to advertise it or are they not?
Er are 
It's in the Irish Times like on the property section 
I know that, but there are ways 
on a Friday 
there are ways of doing that they don't do that, you know there's a thing I
well they may just put it, a photograph of it in their offices, they may not put it in the paper
Mm
and then your man also told me, he said, this is something you have to watch them, John says they've already paid that for doing all the advertising
Mm, mm
and I said well why did you pay them before they, the job had been done
Yeah
oh that's the way we did it and we got it something off, this guy also said which some auctioneers like  who are highly recognized
Mm
you can do a deal
Mm, mm
whereas they will work on a lower percentage of the house sale
Mm, mm
than what is tendered
Mm, mm
and you can do a package deal as such, but you incorporate all the advertising they do, but you'll have to get in there and kind of knock a deal out
Mm, right
you don't say I want my house sold full stop, cos they'll make you that
Well we have , yes that's right, they could do it
er, and you say, you said you have to watch them
Er what you're saying then is that the house then is being, gonna be put up
It's gonna be put on the market, but that 
Aye 
doesn't mean it's gonna be sold, after,af supp supposedly after Easter
Oh
that is when the so called, which is another point I don't agree with, the so called tide comes in, that people are more interested in buying houses
Well that actually is true 
Yeah well that is 
The general it is true but 
Yes 
Yeah 
in this particular area you sell a house any time
Er I, well
in this particular area 
well if people have money if the people have money
Well they do, look, the rich people can buy a house any time they want
Mm, mm
and the rich will buy a house in this area, like you have Embassy people
Mm
who, who buy, have fixed up staff in Dublin, where did they fix them up around here, I mean er, so many different Embassies are understaffed 
Well you see somebody who's who's
if, if they buy it they're going to say well they have to do this one
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
want to make that all different there, the kitchen all in one and the utility room have 
They also want to sell their own house as well probably
Well if they had a house to sell if they're moving
Yeah
there'd be people come along
It's more likely you'll get somebody that's 
Well you'll get people coming along surely out of curiosity
And you get the one 
And they're the ones you need to watch 
and you get the walkers as well saying I'll give you er 
No, if it's strictly by 
Oh yes only view by appointment only 
 
and it happened the first
That doesn't cover, see
after the first night
they don't give appointments to any
I know the time, you've got people who stay, who stay 
I understand this, the selling of the house will not take place here at all, it'll be taken away from the house 
No it's the appointments to view , we're talking about
and also there be no auctioning out furniture in the house or any other 
Oh yes, yes 
No, no , no but they'll, they'll have to people that view it  
they know that, people to come to see the house 
you can, you can state the time to go 
what somebody comes to that, tomorrow and knocks at that door and says look I've been sent here by  you say good bye, good night, good luck nothing has been said to me, I 
 
know nothing about this
And you have to be firm and not let anybody in
Once you have  let anybody in  they'd chop you up and put you in their next stew
