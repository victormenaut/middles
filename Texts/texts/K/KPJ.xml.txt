I just remembered  junction thirteen.
Fourteen.
Right.
Oh!
I dunno know what to do with this.
So you know what you did last year?
Nope.
I dunno what to do 
Just stay here.
with this.
I reckon you should speak to Mr  and see where they went.
They might cause more trouble than that.
Mm.
You might be right.
Aye.
Depends what 
Actually, we've seen it before but they've got a huge big  and it didn't look that big.
Mhm.
I mean, it's much wider than there.
It's like, something like mine, the back end
Aye.
of the chairs.
Er, probably.
And it didn't squeak a lot though.
Much better isn't it?
Well I'd just got it in, and the doorbell went, it was Berty and Joke, Joke had on his uniform and all 
Mhm.
that.
Er  Joke went to Berty, and he says well you better tell her, you've arranged it all!
What's wrong?
What is it?
He says, well he'll tell you, you know.
Well what is it then?
And er  he says well  Berty's arranged for a van to sa to get this suite.
So I says when?
When?
He says, as soon as possible.
I said, well how soon's that?
And I thought, oh gee!
She says half five?
Jesus Christ!
This is only  what, ten to five.
God!
Doesn't leave me with much time.
So er  says right, I'll see you later, and just as we'd gone away Joke got back out the car  er, and she says don't worry about the money.
And I said, I've got it there.
And er, she said I didnae worry you   and er  he turned round and just leave it there, so I think it  he's coming to get it Saturday.
So that 
Yeah.
settles that.
Yeah.
It was er Dave  's brother, oh  er  Andy .
Mhm.
His brother.
It's was about  quarter past eight when he comes in.
Berty just got here.
Mhm.
Well if he's done the building then, yeah.
Carole's got it.
Cos she's got this  and exchange 
 
it.
Aye.
Cos she's got a hundred pound
That's right.
that's why she's swapping.
My er, cos I don't  
Aha.
It was actually alright  apart from the cushions on the couch.
Aye.
They were very  well that 
Worn.
one's .
Cos they're the same, it's, you know, roughly the same.
Does she want  
Yeah.
So the 
I'm talking about having the bloody money to do this, you know.
Yeah.
So  when they brought the seat back it was about  quarter  quarter to six I think.
I think they got all in including the settee I think.
Mhm.
And I offered them a fiver to pay o for the van but they didn't take it.
It was very nice, very .
But you have to take it 
Do you want a cup of coffee.
I didn't even eat tea nothing because by the time hoovered and they were away.
Mhm.
Then they went away about six.
And er  Kelly saw the ra Neighbours.
So I put the dinner on  just after Neighbours finished, I thought they'd go.
They did eventually go out of the house  but he was about done  and then he comes in five to seven.
last night?
Aye, he would be.
Oh.
Cos he come 
Aha.
straight to bed with a Lemsip.
Well, Morris  didn't come in last night, but her car was there
Mhm.
till very, very late.
Erm, and I spoke to her in, in Tina's car and she was caught out.
Oh.
Kelly didn't make them  quarter to ten  comes in.
It was late though.
Quite hoarse though.
Ste Steven I mean.
But  he didnae tell me that he, he has  telled me in a way.
Aye.
I just want to know what why 
Is Ben, is 
why, why he done that, you know.
But he said that Alec denied it, whatever it was.
But Margaret told me  well it was years ago  up at the Germany , says his wife left him.
Mm.
He went up, and it's first time he'd seen her for a while and she said something about, oh he was supposed to have something   but he got to hear this  well it's got nothing to do with all the others.
Cos Alec said something to me about Maggie.
I says, well what?
Ah, I don't understand it because Margaret, Alec got on well with Margaret.
Maybe they both knew that is, I don't know.
See Margaret was going to be, be  erm    what d'ya call it?
Like what I had.
Mhm.
He was married at the time but he wasnae .
Mhm.
He had a flat over   I think it was.
And he came, Alec thought she was a bit abrupt like, but she was alright.
Didnae offend, and didnae offend me.
Was that, are they ma are they married?
Yeah.
Aye they, they didn't know.
Mhm.
But I mean they phoned and that so, he cannae have been 
Aha.
well you probably find it's  
Well she never got in contact with me again.
And meeting her again, she was married.
Mhm.
He told  erm  I think it was Berty that tell Alec.
Or Berty  telled somebody and it 
Mhm.
looks really  anyway, eventually.
I think they're going to move down south.
I think it was Kerry that tell us.
Black Kerry?
And er  Margaret never got her money back from er, for  .
Ah, but you never found it was Berty's son that co you know what he's like.
Exactly.
It's, Margaret probably said that.
Well that's what Lucy said, that it wouldnae lasted too long, I mean, it was over a year.
But er  Berty said it would have only lasted a couple of weeks, cos Alec won't talk.
But it was Berty getting stuck on the  it did go on for so long.
Mhm.
You probably find he said something to her.
Anyway, and I weren't gonna say that to him.
He says to her  aye, he says, I could tell you a few things about Fiona  that'll make your hair curl.
I says, I bet you couldn't.
He says, I bet you I could.
I said, don't talk .
And er  this was him trying to get off the subject when he was getting a bit nervous I think.
Well you better get ready.
Go for a bath.
You just go like this.
This.
Oh you mean if you,, I says I was getting that for years Berty.
He was really taken aback cos he says to me, you didn't tell anybody, then you Joe.
Well kind, what kind did she say?
I think she's getting worse!
But he thought this is a big surprise then.
Especially when he was trying to get off with her.


Aye.
Aye, that's .
It's nice to let us know.
Ah.
You get us used to it.
What are you gonna do, go and tell them?
Give him a   this afternoon.
Er  tell him then.
Twenty.
I'll charge six from silver.
Mhm.


Six, six, seven
Twenty.
I saw Steph today.
I haven't a, I haven't got a clue what to get her.
See .
Well not bad, not a bad idea sometimes
I know.
is it?
Better that than buying summat for
Well either
all I could is, I'll get Tracy summat to wear  and you got time, and she picks like a blouse, she'd pay a hundred pound for one.
Oh right.
She wastes her money all the time on clothes.
She has to go to Next, nowhere else.
Or Wallis's at a push.
I think  and I keep thinking well I'm not going in there buying her anything.
I was just looking at some of the prices they want for the property.
It's ridiculous!
Yeah.
For a leasehold  just the offers over eighty five thousand.
Did you read that one?


No contact.

And can you  can you book me that for  
That's the name,.
What's Monday's date?
The third?
Third.
Yeah.
Suggested there's been  a hundred and fifty grand allocated to the factory  for er  foundations and extension.
And they  suggested it?
Yeah?
I'm not sure wha 
Mhm.
over, over what's the time period.
I mean that  if it's over like two years  make quite a difference though.
Yeah.
Well  they said that it is going to cost about seventy five to get the kitchen done.
Mhm.
And the outside with er  they say  say  a hundred thousand tops for er  including getting a  a kiosk made up to a  a food bar.
Yeah.
But then again, it depends if  till they build an extension  out in the back, it'll cost a fortune.
Er
Are you getting all this up to  scratch for ninety three?
I would imagine so, yeah.
Mm mm.
Cos after that they'll be fitting their own  here.
They're getting the region to do that.
Yeah.
Er  well  it's only what I've heard it's 
See how it goes.
Aye 
it's not
it's not on paper yet.
Mm.
Jim came this morning.
What's that?
Er Jim  the joiner.
Aha.
The girls were wanting  something done, partitioned off up the back or something  for the draught coming under
Yeah.
Yeah.
the communal  
Yeah.
We never had one of the proper forms so he's  coming back later  with forms with us you see.
Yeah.
He's gotta come back in the morning but he never said that.
Have you finished, totalled up the rolling?
I, I ha I haven't done it yet.
No.
Right.
I'll do it.
I thought I'd give you it.
I have the shifts to do over here.
A I was doing my er 
Yeah.

I'll draw up that sheet for er  they'll probably start Monday the twelfth.
The Coke machine's out of Coke.
Right.
So yo er 
I'll fill out a, I'll take about six case up.
I think it's about four cases to go up  four or five cases.
Did you have them  that big  ?
Yeah.
You did?
Yeah.
Aye.
Yeah, I was watching it.
That's it.
Wait till you see them done.
And hear about all the ?
Yeah.
Yep.
And make the  both the coffees and chocolate size and er
Just filled them up this morning.
It must be the way you're doing the machine.
Tuesday.
I'll, I'll write it down and put a sticker up on the wall.
I've got the dentist at  half past four .
So I dinnae forget.
You know how you said you'd work Tuesday
Oh right.
Yeah.
for me, so, I've arranged to go back to the dentist then.
Had to phone them last night.
I meant to phone them on Wednesday when I got in.
Yes and  Billy comes in on a Tuesday.
Yes.


I was telling Steven, he says it's about time some of them's done well.
Cos he's gotta end up getting  I wonder 
Well it's 
what it'll be like?
it's for her good
The night after that.
and it's 
Yeah.
and it's also for er  everyone else's is good.
Mhm.
Cos 
It's not that, but, every time he came  he came near us  George was saying  coming out with an excuse, er that's a phone for you.
Erm
Yeah.
accounts is on the phone.
You know, and he  and you're hiding.
That's the thing, the thing is like, and like er, he's  Billy's been given a lot of scope though, erm, to just go out and do his own thing  and  he thinks  like a, as a, I was speaking to like his er  course tutor  and it is erm  Councillor   and  Katie was saying that  Billy thinks that because he's got, he's got this, this wee job now that like, he's er  he's the street cred  you know, he's cool.
Mhm.
But he's not.
Erm  and he seems to think that er er, because he's got this freedom  and he's got this street cred  that like er,wo women will just fall over him.
And go out and spend his  money .
Well that's it, you know 
Mm.
so erm  er  th the thought, the thought did occur to me that perhaps one of these times he's gonna actually  go beyond just like talking, and perhaps touching somebody.
Mhm.
Erm  which is, a definite no-no.
Cos I mean, he's starting to make a beeline for Carol now and  she's getting the creeps about it.
Well, that's er, that's why 
Mhm.
it's being knocked on the head now.
Before he gets any serious  And er, er Fiona  one of his tutors  upstairs, she's like er, the floor manager as well, yeah?
Mhm.
mentioned get some of the staff .
Right.
So he'll probably get  I think he, he goes to the class first, then come, and he comes downstairs.
So as soon as he gets told he'll be
He'll be straight down.
He'll be straight down.
Mm.
Expecting to see you.
Mhm.
So
He'll get a shock!
It's not that though, er, I mean I've worked with a mental handicap and, it gets to the stage  whe like you say though  I'm not just touching you, I'm just  And the strength they've got, you're  their strength.
Aye.
Well since  he got the er, male nurse sat .
Mhm.
He's been, said that to his wife there  touching you up at his side.
Aye.
I mean it's a shame somebody's getting sacked because of him.
Well I mean I, apparently he'd been giving this, this guy stick  like all day.
And you can only take so much.
And eventually rap rapped his face and called him a  effing person like, you know, it's
Mm.
and this guy got him by the throat and pinned him to the wall and said Billy shut up!
Or you'll be seen by an auxiliary?
Mhm.
And Billy complained and   and said yeah I saw it.
The guy was sacked.
So after that he got a bit cocky.
Erm  
I mean there's times I could just take Billy and just  but then you have to think, no.
Yeah.
Can't be done.
Calm down.
That's right.
I thought Billy we wa would have been in by now.
What's that?
I thought the work would have been here.
What is this?
Right.
Can I have some cash?
What?
What  er Sandy what happened about the hot sweets today was  the su I had six customers all came in, they all saw the strudel and they said, oh, we'll have strudel.
Chris said, she said well she didnae mind going down for it.
So every one that I brought up was sold.
Aye.
Tell them, it's just the way it is, that was how things have gone.
Yeah, no I meant this hot sweet er, erm  erm  there's one or two that's saying that er er  every five or ten minutes, I thought well 
No, no.
No.
you're gonna have  doing it instead  
No, I only got, because I knew he was coming back up
Yeah.
wi more food, so I 
Aha.
asked him if he'd bring up six sweets, I never bothered him before.
Yeah, that's er, certainly Michael.
Hope hopefully ah, er these guys are getting
Alright.
puds today.
But
A apparently they were in the college yesterday  but they er couldn't find , went away again.
It's their problem.
What happened, what happened with the sweets then?
Oh it's stupid!
What?
Well  there was six customers wanting, all wanting , right fine, I'm not getting it 
Yeah.
and I explained to them that it really wouldnae be piping hot , and then John came up with stuff  and the custard
Mhm.
and cos he paid him twice for that, their sweets, and John was coming up , so, I don't know if it was genuine,asked him and I  cos I knew John was coming up 
Aye.
and I knew I had orders for them all, Katriane.
Mhm.
with them.
And so she come in  and that .
No, I can see it's alright, it's alright.
And er 
Cos that was only just ten minutes going back.
I thought erm, oh well   cos like, I explained yesterday there was no way we could have them because of there was only the pair.
This is stupid!
Mm.
And I thought, you know,.
Yeah.
So there's
you see?
sixty pence, and six, and it's three pound sixty.
And   they're all ordered, they're all for different people  cos John is coming up with sweets.
Mm.
That's what I said to him .
He's just touchy with everyone.
I mean, the thing is Katriane, it wasnae putting him out!
And it wasn't putting anybody else out!
But it was absolutely .
Oh well, John  John .
Mhm.
He says, I'm not just running round for six hot sweets!
And I mean
Mm.
like that, touchy.
Oh!
He had bad news and he, he wanted to talk to you about it at twelve o'clock.
But you know, working with
Aye.
I know.
I know.
But I thought, after all, I'm gonna like that at all.
No.
To her, I'm not gonna get called out the back
No.
especially when I had customers standing.
Aye.
That's right.
He sent his upstairs and he talked through that intercom to me, I says put your, you didnae press the button!
Like that, I was shouting him.
And he keeps pressing it and you , cannae hear him.
That's it.
Because you get, all you do is, is press that button up there and let it go  and you can talk.
Aye.
It's that  you've got to put on, so 
Aye.
you hear
Aye.
or talk.
To talk you press it in.
But upstairs he presses it in as well, and I, I'm not hearing
Aye.
it's muffled.
Aye.
And he sa and he said to me one day, are you fucking deaf!
And I heard it.
I says, I haven't got any, and he came down here and I said to him, I'll give you fucking deaf alright!
I said, when you press that button upstairs it muffles it and there's nothing you can do.
Oh right!
I didn't realize that.
 
I said, well fine.
But lucky I've said.
I know.
I thought, if you shout that I'm fucking deaf again I'm going to bash you!
Ignore him.
I just ignore his sentiments, that's what I do.
Ah.
I don't really throw 
I know.
The only thing I've do I thought, oh no, I know when, I've no do I feel I've no done anything wrong.
I know.
And it seems that if I go Steve, right, bring me up a dozen sweets and I haven't  selled one of them  well that would be  
 
enough.
Aye.
Well that's  , but not when I've just sold six.
Right!
Ooh!
Aha.
Ah!my leg.
I'll put them  in the file.
That's it.
Cos they've been building up like that and they're bound to fall down.
Do you want them to do a menu rotation or  keep making them up every week?
Like do a twelve week menu cycle?
I've tried that.
All it does is .
But wha what we've go gotta watch out for is like er  there's plenty there though, and like 
Mhm.
always like, quite  when they  re repeat the same thing the week after.
Mhm.
So it's ham and mushroom  by chicken  and ham?
I bet she does it.
Er, what's the soup today?
Er  spring veg.
Has it got meat stock in it?
No, veg.
I'll probably just have some soup .
Erm  it's  there's some things we  we're okay to do .
Mhm.
Or a , you see the same  every week.
Er
But if we get them to sit down and actually  do the cycle  you know, so they do it 
Yeah.
theirself.
I've found that in the past
Ah.
erm  I think we were working on a six week cycle 
Mhm.
the last time.
Cos it seems to be,th do, going okay just now.
I mean 
Mhm.
erm
a couple of days they seem to have two big sellers on as well and then one, one day
Yeah.
there's  you're not so, not a good seller on any of the food.
Well  spaghetti bolognaise and 
Mhm.
chilli, has, has, has never really been  er, big sellers 
A big seller.
here.
Course then  I mean, you don't have chilli, you can
Mhm.
if, if you try and do enchiladas or 
Mhm.
erm
Tacos?
tacos.
I mean  we  we, we've got taco shells, but I find that the taco shells have kinda got a wee funny taste to them.
Mm mm.
Erm
That's the cheap ones though.
Yeah.
Heavily shred your lettuce and you've got tomato on as well, and it's  and cheese or whatever you 
Mm.
want.
If I was the one doing chilli  
Yes.
God!
I'm not gonna eat all that!
Ah you will, you will, done it before.
I've got to use a knife.
We'll see in a minute.
Mhm.
