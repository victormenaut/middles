Motown 
of music?
Status Quo, Genesis  Fleetwood Mac  and a bit of Motown on there.

Mm.
Better than Thursday night when Mick  's doing it, when he's doing the er  sort of thrash metal for
Mm.
an hour and half solid!
Yeah.
A bit heavy going.
I sound like, I sound like my mum and dad though when I'm criticizing it, you know.
All sounds the same, it's just a noise   and you know, you can't th the words !
Well you 
You sound like your mum and dad criticizing the music, you know.
Sixties and seventies.
Ninety perce ninety percent of records in charts today there's no words anyway are they?
Mm.
It's all music.
No that's right.
So, anyway, it's not even that is it?
It's all computerized today

Do that, bloody wanna tape on.
Well you are  we can get  Dawn's brother if you want.

Ooh !

Big city job.
Oh yeah, yeah.

See  she sounds like a wimp though.
My anguish, my life's shattered sort of thing!
God!
The last thing I'd do when I get Mr .
Especially when .
Yeah .
Yeah.
It's a, is it in, and he's just saying that  the develop redevelopment starts in autumn?
Yeah.
I mean I 
Summat in autumn.
I think it's, I think that's erm  well it's not exactly a bluff, but it's, it's a case of  er  what they hope will happ hope will happen.
Er  I don't think  are pulling out but they, they've suspended  things, but I mean they just don't know if they're competing.
They just the politics .
Yeah.
I mean, they can't possibly erm  you know, cos they 
Mm.
can't, you can't accuse  just Jean of corruption, they've got to  they've got to accuse  the development corporation of corruption as well.
You know, cos you can't be corrupt just on one person, you've gotta have two people playing
Oh aye.
but, you know.
So th to a, you know, and as  said, you know we    erm we don't need to bribe anybody to come into Morecambe.
Right.
You know  nobody else would come in!
No, that's it.
You know, that's just my point, you know .
Nobody wants to come here and spend money do they?
No.
Oh well!
It just, I think it, I think it affected us last week so  erm  cos the, the Friday night was well down.
Mm.
It was only, only about ninety people  two hundred people  Friday.
I think it was overspeculated in the press that we've  sold the premises and it, it  well gave the impression that perhaps we might be open  you know, some people might not think we're open even.
Well that's what, what I said on Saturday 
Yeah.
they didn't think they'd be open, you know.
Yeah.
When they come for tea, you know 
Mm.
on Friday, thought they were closed.
Yeah.
Mm.
And if you're coming through from Lancaster, you know, as soon a it's a far old drag innit?
After the pubs are closed, on the off-chance, I mean, cos if you get here what the hell do you do if  not as if you've got an alternative is there?
No.
You know.
If yo if you're gonna come here yo you're the ki not on a Saturday night, you're not the kind of clientele that's gonna go to the Empire
Oh no.
Prince's Tea Rooms and so  you gotta traipse all the way back into Lancaster to go 
Mm.
to The Alley.
Yeah.
What like, putting a bus on which  shows you that you was open like, you know 
Mm.
put a bus on on a Wednesday night.
Yeah, that's right.
So  How do!
Oh!
Hello Mark.
Hi.

Bloody freezing out there!
Oh well!

I just wonder sometimes when Terri turns things on.
It is very cold!
Last   last time she put the ventilation on instead.
Can you just hang about here I'll just  go and check.
Okay.
Bet it's blasting cold air out  for an hour!
Anyway, sod though Mark!

It's phew!
What a scorcher!
There's people up there in their underpants!
Well I wanna see the people that
It's nothing to do with the climate.
Am I right in  in thinking that we're having some new speakers?
Yes.
Why?
Well, what we're doing is putting the erm  ha!
We're putting the  the  tannoy system back in.
Right.
Into operation.
and everything's back out again 
Yeah.
and it's
Right.
Well you know the oogamyflip's du in there.
Four speakers  around the dance floor  and er two big bass things.
Mm.
Mick's gonna, getting those together and
Yeah I know.
Cos they, they kept blowing before though didn't they, those?
If I remember rightly.
Well  yeah.
Did they?
Yeah, but it was only really, we had that  we had those soul D Js that, that, that were blowing them that was the problem.
Yeah.
And they shouldn't have blown.
Now there's some  mild mannered rock D J to
to look after the speakers.
True.
I hear you were at the Empire the other night?
I was indeed, yes.
Just sniffing about, you know  see what's going on.
How many were in?
Four hundred or so.

They're doing summat right.
He's bashing down from the campus.
How much is it to get in?
A quid.
Cheap drinks.
Yeah well I mean  a quid a pint or something isn't it?
Yeah.
A pound a pint for lager, and one twenty for Pils.
That's
I mean, so there's  he's still making a reasonable mark- up on that.
Mm.
I mean  well, not a reasonable mar he's still making money on the drinks 
Mm.
it's not as if you're like  selling them at cost and making a few pence because 
Mm mm.
No.
 
I must say I was quite surpri I've never set foot in the place before  since that time  we went down  before it was open.

Well I dunno, I don't know what it is.
Very unusual.
 
They start  wanker bit, you know, it's like all they  tend 
 
to do.
Mm.
They're only small lads, you know, sort of playing  guitars and stuff.
I don't think they were gonna play anything.
Because there's only a couple, they only had a couple of security guards didn't they?
Ooh!

And troubleshot around  various establishments.
Then he went so solo, he  he got erm  er doing regular thing up at erm  Ocean Heads I think, or summat.

Difference between playing Guild Hall and filling Guild Hall.
Mm.
True.
I dunno they're, they're damn popular if only, I mean 
Yeah.
I know
It was one of the best 
but I would, I wouldn't have sa 
selling albums of last year.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I wouldn't, I, I mean, yeah, but I mean I wouldn't have thought  I mean they're certainly 
No it wouldn't do four thousand 
No.
I mean  
I mean I wouldn't 
you 
No.
know.
I would have thought that  for Morecambe they're probably looking at like a thousand  eleven hundred people if, you know 
Yeah.
would be a good one.
I would have thought.
Yeah.
Well I'm sort of like.
Depends on timing 
Foot in the door a bit see, see if I can sort of, you know
You alright?
Hello Kenneth?
Alright.
I'm just starting to .
You know, what he's doing really so
Yeah.
sort of well a couple of nights deejaying will do me for a start really.
Who's doing a Wednesday night then?
Well, he's doing it, last wee I wouldn't mind doing the Wednesday actually cos  I can do that sort of  you know, student discos, you know, so 
Yep.
and I don't have to go to work on Thursday, so  you know  th that always helps.
Right.
So  likewise the Saturday nights here, I'm alright I don't have to get up in the morning.
Mm.
Ha.
Yeah.
What is it on Wednesday, is it ten till, ten till two, or nine till two or 
Erm 
what do they do a bus shuttle?
Er, I think they have, I think they'd have, I think they have two buses on er er  a week so  and then they go back if there's any more.
It's a long haul that innit though?
Mm.
Here.
I mean, how many students are from Morecambe nowadays?
Er, d'ya know?
I've no idea.
Must be a fair number.
I've no idea to be honest.
There's not as many as there used to be.
No.
No, no, no.
I mean we when I  when I came here  it was virtually, virtually half, half the population of that.
And then there was  maybe a thousand people out of out of Morecambe.
Mm.
That's it.
And the Uni was then only about two thousand eight hundred strong.
Mm.
But there's quite a lot of erm  development in Lancaster now.
They're doing loads of  erm, flats and there's all those, all that stuff round   Highcross area.
Yeah.
But  .
Is it?
I think so, but  well that's part of St. Martin's College really, isn't it that er
Some of it is.
I thought some of it was the Uni.
But, you know, I mean, if the Uni goes to ten thousand in  what  what is it, it's getting up for about ninety five, ninety six?
It's quite quick.
Something like that.
It's 
Yeah.
very quick  really.
Yeah, I mean that, well it's only fo well it's four, five thousand now?
But I mean you're talking
Six.
It's five.
Well, whatever.
Six.
You're talking about 
Mm.
doubling in size basically aren't you in, in  in the next three years?
Mm.
That's going some!
Well then I'll have to get an extension.
It's like sardines now in there.
Yeah.
I know, it's unpleasant innit?
It's always been popular along with students ain't it?
Aye.
Like the only pub that is.
Well Barry's doing alright now.
Is he?
He's sort of got students in there  new landlord and all that so  I think.
It's always packed out with students these days.
Must have got some student  then?
That's right.
It's er 
Mind you, it's convenient for the Sugar House innit?
Yeah.
I mean I always thought, I always thought The Tramway  The Yorkshire, and  were always gonna do quite well out the Sugar House 
Mm.

Yeah.
out of it.
Whereas the  was that

I mean, it's not as nice a pint as  now that Whitbread's have taken over and  half the time.
They reckon Lancastrians have got a good pint of Boddys.

Mm.
Well
Yeah.
it's not too bad, it doesn't matter what you play.
Mm.

Fine.
You wanna do it from what, half eight el half eight they wanted till eleven or  
Right.

Er, I don't know yet.
Erm  couple of hundred maybe.
Probably less.
How much is it?
Yeah I was gonna say, I've heard these before !
Well I know but I meant 
Private bookings.
the trouble is, I mean they're looking for somewhere  to have it.
I've given out three hundred invites and sit around with 
Well that's reminded me the erm 
twenty people.
the erm  Lancy's is one of the places they were thinking of, upstairs.
Aha.
Alright.
But the chances are nobody'll wanna go till after the pubs anyway with these dos so, cos it's not actually  and, they're having a sort of reception  after the wedding
Right.
for erm  everyone in the family and wanting a  a night do you know for 
Mm.
for all their mates and  such like.
When's the  when is the wedding, or when's the reception?
And where?
Well it's all on the same day.
I reali I realized it was on the same day Mark.
No but it, oh right.
Er, erm, Saturday the
No, a time  what time are they  planning 
Oh I don't know yet.
Is there a gap, I mean how big is the gap between like the reception and the party kind of thing?
Er, I haven't got a clue.
I mean, are they likely to run into one another?
Are people likely to stay in one and
Oh no, no, I don't think so.
No.
I think the morning wedding, then a af sort of  mi midday
Mm.
reception.
In Torrizone  or is it Garstone?
Yeah.

So   with, with a bunch of flowers.

Anyway, and I mean, just a, I mean it might not happen it was just like
Yeah.
I said, well that'll probably be alright if they wanna do it.
Cos they wanted me to do the disco you see.
Yeah.
And I said well I'm working that night.
They said, well how about  you know
Yeah.
Who is it?
Are they people  I know and not rough.

Well that's right.
Top man me!

Eh!
I tell you 
Top man!
what last Saturday
Mm.
I had Alistaire singing your praises!
Alistaire who?
Alistaire, as in  loony, psychopath Alistaire!
Oh right.
Why's that then ?
Well, he was talk we were talking about the rave and th what was wrong with it  and he was saying basically it was  they'd got four DJs who were all techno  and they were like brilliant!
He said, you know  that you won't get better
techno D's outside London and then, even then they could pushing it, I mean, they're all their own mixes  do all their own mixes and 
Mm.
you know, they're, and the scratching guy he said is  best he's ever heard anywhere.
He said, but  it's the same  all night long, you know .
And I said, well  I know nothing about that kind of music but that's the impression I got, I was just stood there at the bar thinking  that last, last Friday it's not the same one  , thinking, you know, this is just  this is just very samey  it 
Mm.
sounds really samey.
So erm  oh, cheers mate!
So he said yeah, he said it's like, you know it's like if played erm
That
you know, thrash all night long on a Saturday night you're gonna have fifty, sixty people who think it's wonderful  but you're never gonna get more than fifty, sixty people.
Erm  so he ju he was taking it  over for a couple of weeks.
Anyway
Alright?
Hello there.
You know
cutting a long story short.
Saying how good you were.
He said to say, cos he, we were talking about DJs in general and how basically if  performing artist if anything else, you know, you've still gotta react to your audience and all that sort of thing.
Yeah.
and he's er  yes  er
What the hell does he know anyway?
He was saying you taught, he, he taught him everything he knows!
Ho!
This didn't say Alistaire that I know and love.
He was saying how he used to  stand awestruck in the Sugar House and listen to you all night long!
And learnt all the tricks of the trade.
I thought he always there 
 
I thought Mark in the Sugar House he was  drunk 
 
most of the time.
You know 
Yeah , that's why he was so good.
No, I said to Dean he was.
Will I give him a job there?
And anyway    you ought to try, you ought to have tried telling him a few !
Mm.
Yeah, well  he does get a bit of  over the top  
No, No.
I mean this was like  this was like
I mean, he's not even
midday on a Saturday.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No adrenalin buzzing, no.
Well he doesn't drink any more but
No.
He's given up smoking as well hasn't he?
Aye.
He was actually reasonably  reasonably pleasant.
Except when he went off into fi fantasy land.
Battling up and down motorways in  cars !
Sorting out drug dealers the length and breadth of the British Isles!
Oh yeah.
Regular Robin Hood.
Stop and search him.
Yeah.
Rob Roy.
Yeah, well at least it's only 
Rob Roy !
he owes me anyway.
That he's owed me for  a year!
Just about.
What was that from?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Well he's got himself a B M W and he can't pay  pay his record bill.
Ooh!
Sounds like Trevor  to me.
Is Trevor still buying?
What happened with Brooks?
Dunno.
But I sa but I knew Mick was doing 
or something 
I know that.
It's what?
He's so open.
Oh yeah!
Ye yeah.
Er er I know, I know.
I just wonder what's I  last I heard they were  the receiver was trying to pull it into the collapse but er
Oh!
Don't know.
I thought they did quite well.
I thought it was go make a club .
Well it's the only club in, in Lancaster that's that's the problem.
Yeah, he always seems to fiddle .
Well I mean the Sugar House is
Mm.
is 
Mm.
a student place and always will 
Yeah.
be and
It is crap!
What Brook?
Brook.
Cos those 
Oh I know.
erm
as town night clubs go 
Yeah but it's a club 
I mean it's 
and there's no alternative is there?
Hi Ken!
I dunno what's .
And there's  what have I got?
Urgh brurgh 
 
brurgh, hundred and mm mm mm mm mm eighty  hundred and eighty pound, must be  two hundred in
Ha!
Yeah.
Pretty good.
Yeah.
Must be twenty come in  without and paying, and I've let a few in for
Mm.
Mm.
bit less than two fifty.
Oh!
Jolly good!
So it's not bad.
Mm.
Don't know how the bar's coping though.
Oh!
They're alright .
Are they?
I think it bi but they're doing alright.
They'll manage.
That's what they're there for innit?
Yeah.
Got no er  no change at the moment that's the only problem.
Yeah, always seem to be going for some er 
I just send er 
What's it?
Alan.
Alan.
Alan.
Got some at home apparently tucked away  in a piggy bank or something.
He's robbed it off somebody!
How many 
Ain't he ?
were on the bus then?
It was absolutely jam-packed full by the sta the standing, I didn't count them.
No, well 
Will it be ab be about ninetyish I would think.
Mm.
Ninety, ninety two summat like that.
Yeah, we had like fifty in before, fifty, or sixty.
Before the bus come?
Mm mm.
Came?
Yeah, it's picking up again nicely.
Mm.
Well it's a bad time of year ain't it since Christmas?
I mean January 
Yes, yeah that's a point.
anyway, I mean, and then all the sort of  ups and downs with the  press publicity etcetera.
Mm.
Course, yeah.
Yeah.
One or two have mentioned on Thursday actually so I think  best we're open well before.
See how that goes when they feel it.
Well I was just talking to Jean about that today, I mean I  we've gotta keep on doing it but, I think that 
Yeah, if you stop now you'll get nowhere with them will you?
No that's right.
But I mean I think we, I think I, I will need on Monday morning to talk to  er Morecambe Bay  and see if I can bring forward these promotions because 
Yeah.
until I start 
Yeah.
I mean, we should get them back.
You can't,al also I think you should start doing, having people regular again wi it's just 
I know.
not worth it.
The trouble is it's a bit of a catch twenty two because    if you don't put a bus on, will you get the people?
Mm.
It's what you do innit?
That's the problem with it.
the bus for er
I mean nobody actually 
and nobody on it.
nobody's actually said to me a well where, where's the bus on a Thursday?
Nobody's said it yet.
When they 
Mm mm.
start asking
Mm.
then that transport you could ask about putting it back on again.
I mean what a what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like erm  something that's obviously  our crowd and then  either  putting, say, Stella back on or something like that
Mm.
and banging it out  for one  
Can you not stick a band on  pretty soon or nothing like that?
Well
People would think we were
frankly I'm not sure where that stands .
I mean talking to Charlie, just asking about  getting some  student bands on
Yeah.
might be an idea cos remember when we had that thin Mar 
 
when we had that thin Martin's band on.
Yeah, but I was in  
I mean 
gonna say, stick them back on cos they 
Yeah.
went down really well.
And they brought a big following down didn't they?
They brought a big following.
Yeah, that's right.
Er, I mean if you, if they, if they 
There was about a hundred with thin Martin on the other hand.
Yes.
Yes.
It was a really good night that.
If you make it known that there's stuff like that going on, if you get a band like that you can always just 
Mm.
put a bus on for some people that come down.
Mm.
You get a couple of leads like that it'll start picking up 
Yeah.
up there.
That's right.
So
Like ya, like you say it is a difficult situation at the moment innit?
Mm.
And what to do for the best.
Mm.
Yeah.
But I, I say if I get  sh publicity I er  if I say do, if I say  cos we haven't got a premium lager on draft so if I stick Stella on draught
Mm.
and then do it as an offer.
You 
Eleven  best we can do in  
Okay.
and fives.
Great!
So you gotta take it up 
Yeah.
Great!
there.
Get it up to Terri.
 
I'll get you a bottle full then this .
Yeah.
Is it like cold out?
Drizzly rain though as well.
Is it?

Oh no!
Full, it's full.
If there's over  three thousand
No, there's not that many.
Alright then.
If there's over two thousand and I'm gonna come back and get my fucking money back!
Right.
The trouble is that it  I know, I say I'm going on about haven't got a copper and everything, then they walk up to the bar and  pull out a great wad of notes 
Yeah.
out of it, out of it, out of the pocket !
I know.
When do you start  when do you start fishing again then?
D'ya think?
In a  couple of weeks I think.
It's alright if you're 
Mm.
I'm playing again  up till no all normal now.
Like that  was saying   if you wanted to, about three months cos I mean  kept putting 
Mm.
him off, putting him off.
But  I'm getting a, I'd, I'd, I'm up to normal now, I've got everything  back on a normal par I think.
So 
Mm.
Mm.
I start  before you start, I'm going fishing now.
What, you go out in the  i is it in the summer when you go out the boat?
Or the erm  spring or summat?
Well, summer, I don't know  I'd like to go for about it,whe whether it's calm or not, you know if it's nice and calm but
Mhm.
well that's a  a place like Morecambe  I just couldn't be bothered.
Yeah.
So  I go at any time  late at night.
I say  over Christmas though my car was in its garage  in bits.
So  that didn't go down too well with our lot but  it's either that or it blow up  all the time.
Yeah.
Do you go out far?
Or do you just  you fe in a 
 
in a boat or do you go out far?
Depends, last time  we went out, we went  just off Longbay Island other side of Wallasey.
Yeah I know.
Yeah.
So  one guy caught a  twenty eight pounder like.
You know  good fishing out there.
But otherwise  you stop in harbour  fish .
Mm.
You can take your chance.
How long  how long can you stay out?
I mean I, you know, how long does th 
Usually if 
how long's the tide and that?
if you go out on a charter it's twelve hours  you know, if you go for 
Yeah, but then you're going out a distance aren't you?
To other side of Wallasey you do twelve 
Yeah.
hours.
No, I mean if you just keep using the bay 
Oh aye.
the bay.
Depends on time  you go out for a time
Mm.
come in with tide.
eight hours.
Can you?
Yeah.
But now, this dinghy club that my mate's  and he, he's got tractors at Cromer that take them out of water so
Mm.
Mm.
he's a fisher full time.
Yeah.
Mm.
What's it like around the power station?
Is, is there, is there, are they ploughing warm water into, into there or is it
Well there's warm water coming out int there?
Yeah.
Well I presume, I presumed there was.
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
I mean is it affecting any of that  good fishing up there or is that 
Well the
that a  
I can, certainly you can float for  and the moor.
Mm.
Yeah.
You can float from, but you get a lot of soft wind.
Right.
But, plenty of them around.
I never use them as well as my own.
That's 
Mm.
right.
Is there much mackerel around?
In boat?
Er  like when you go out and catch mackerel you use it for fresh bait then.
Yeah.
So
See, it's not a bad fish to eat actually, mackerel.
Mind you, we don't eat fish.
No.
And  I went to  last summer we took a  er  I took a sha er not a sha erm  tt  static caravan in, at er  Prestatyn  an and erm 
Mhm.
and like, we were just flicking through Ceefax on the telly and it was like  one of these luxury six berth ones and it was ninety nine quid for a week and, and 
Really?
I mean it was beautiful inside!
They're normally like a two hundred and fifty, three hundred quid one
Mm.
but it was  it was cos you had  you know, you had to go that week kind of thing.
So we just thought well   then.
Erm  I took the nine year old boat out and just went out in a  boat we had  Mary went as well, we were like  the all  job for mackerel  put this guy's
Mhm.
twelve guys on, that's what I didn't want  two small mackerel caught in over 
Mm.
three hours, you know.
Poor guy was going, well I don't understand it, you know, normally we  Went to erm  Malta last year and there was a great erm  tt  it's called an underwater safari, but, you know, normally when you're, like on Windermere like you've got a glass-bottomed boats
Oh have they?
well this was the all, the ho all the hull underneath the water line was glass  so you were actually sitting  you know, you weren't looking down, you were actually sitting in, in the  base of the hull of the boat 
Yeah.
and, and going, and they went  er it went out in, off  to er some of these islands off er  rocks and that, tour of  Malta and that it was superb!
You were abs you know you were  er absolute, I mean it was, it was 
Yeah.
as good as aqualunging without actually getting wet, it was great you know!
Very good idea that.
Must have made a fortune!
It was packed like three or four times a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean people are fascinated by the sea aren't they?
They really are.
Oh yeah.
My wife's just gone America shark fishing.
Oh yeah!
Right.
Yeah.
Off Mexico down that way.
Yeah.
Marlin  big marlin 
Yeah.
That's what they call big marlin.
Sixteen quid a day it is to put boat 
Yeah.
out there.
It's not much really is it?
My friend went last year 
They pay that in bloody  mackerel fishing
Oh aye.
for the twelve hours don't you ?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
He went out  he went  fly-drive last year, and he went down
Have you seen that 
to Mexico.
have you seen that movie, it was on erm  tt  I was watching a programme the other day about it.
They've developed a camera  for your line  for th for the mackerel, for the ma marlin and the shark fishing  erm  and basically you can actually watch  you can, you can ac you've got a  your T V screen so it, it's er, it's like a spectator sport as well cos you can actually watch  the, the, the fish coming to take your bait.
Yeah.
You know, so it's like yo you've got on this minute camera on the line and everything, you know so it, so that you can actually get the excitement of watching it  you know, coming and taking 
Can we have a little bit of a discount?
Yeah you can.
Course you can.
How much is it then?
Couple of quid each.
Couple of quid each!
Couple of quid each!
So we can start
Shark fishing's only  
That's all you have, that's only have to have a little bit.
Yeah!
Yeah!
You've asked for a lot!
 
Can we have a lot of a discount please ?
Only gotta drink, drink, drink that's lots of drink a drink.
A drink a drink !
Give us three quid for the pair of you.
Right.
You give him three quid and I'll give the rest in.
Cheers.
Yeah.
So you buy first two beers then.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
No!
Well isn't it?
Well I did  
The guy was talking to Pete, he thought he could, he develop, he could develop for coarse fishing 
Bye bye.
er, you know river fishing and that as well, there's spa special camera.
Well where does the actual camera hang off?
It's hung, it it's hung,i i it's actually not below the boat but, but it 
Oh!
Sure can.
get it, you see, but i it's  fantastic watching cos  you know they were  they, they  it was sort of going along the
Yeah.
whatever they were using as bait  presumably some mackerel or something like that but, but as I was saying you could see it trailing through  and then all, suddenly out of like nowhere this fish would come and like  chase after it 
Yeah.
and snap and this, this would go off and you'd be sat there going right then, you actually 
Well presumably 
see it take it, you know 
the camera eye would be adjustable would it?
Or
I presume so, yes.
I mean they was talking about getting a really small for erm
Oh right.
you know, to be, to be used in  in sort of coarse fishing and that.
Mm.
But, of course, the other thing of course ,i it takes out the, the one that got away cos you actually see the one  that got away 
Yeah.
you know ?
Yeah.
There'd  be some story then.
You know what'll happen is  your camera would 
 
the cameras'll magnify it anyway won't it?
Yeah it will.
It will do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was really, I mean it, it meant of course that  the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well, cos I mean, there's nothing worse i if you  if there's only one rod out, or two rods out th those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on, on 
Mm.
those  for the marlin and the  and the sharks and that, fishing?
And you don't get many.
Yeah.
And it's not like, sort of 
Three  there'll be
twelve
three or four maximum 
twelve rods out, yeah.
something like that.
Yeah.
So any anybody else that's going on board is bored out their brains basically!
But at least 
Yeah.
if you got T V monitors you can watch what's going 
Watch it.
on.
That's really good.
So now, now I mean  now with all the radar and  whatever else we're using, I mean  you should really be able to find fish.
Well that, that boat from Evesham that we went out on a couple a years ago it had a fish finder on it.
Mm.
So  it er,fish finder on it.
Yeah.
You throw your line out, you don't get a few just biting.
No.
No, that's right.
That's right.
They've done  most of them are  I mean the wo certainly the ones on the little  little boat trips and that, I mean, they have  all it does is that  it'll tell you there's some fish about, I mean, it doesn't 
Mm.
tell you where to fish or 
Oh no.
depths or anything like that does it?
What they're doing is  there's some fish down there somewhere.
Mm.
Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like  you know, you could be wasting that, you, you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole, there's not a fish anywhere round here!
You know, you could be sat here like an idiot today 
Well that's it I've I've sat on 
for hours on end .
Jay hours on end in middle of night freezing
Mm.
you know like   and I've caught nothing.
And you've 
Yeah.
thought well  there's plenty of crabs  in
Yeah.
summer, take your bait
Yeah.
but every time you throw out  there's a crab on end of it.
You know 
Yeah.
Yeah.
you think, why does that crab always have to come my line.
And all this sea yet it has to get my worm.
And same, like no fish, you think well there must be fish out there.
Yeah.
Well it's, it's luck innit?
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't  we got about three, three thirty in the morning, both of them went out to er  canal somewhere up  Dulgate, past Dulgate  we set up and we'd  we'd been fishing for about two and half hours it's aba about six thirty in the morning this old farmer comes up says er  aye, aye lads, he said er  I wouldn't bother it, they drained this area of the canal a few  months ago!
And we said, oh !
Yeah.
Sat there watching our floats for hours !
I mean
Yeah.
I mean luckily you, you know, you'd gone on a car, with a car so it's a matter of throwing everything in the back and just going 
That's it.
somewhere else so  could have sat there all bleeding day!
And not have known anything about it.
Aye.
I've had some lonely nights.
Yeah.
Do you catch many eels, eels or anything, many eels?
No.
Didn't catch as many this year  as what I have done.
Phworgh!
The slimy things that they are.
Yeah.
You get one of the lads that works with me, if he catches three of them he says well  I'll have them for my dinner.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
They look horrible!
A delicacy.
Mind you, I ate conga.
I, I erm, I was off the west co er  on a holiday to the west coast of Ireland and we erm  we're driving down the west coast and there was like some rocks and everything about, so we stopped and, you know, I looked  by a rock pools or something, and there's this  and the rock pool is like mini-swimming baths, they were, you know, probably
Mm.
twelve foot long and about six or seven foot wide and about 
Mm mm.
six or seven foot deep and they're crystal clear.
And there was this old guy dragging this bloody rope with a massive  hook on the end  like after  after, you know, I presume it was cod or mackerel something along the  and I said, what the hell are you fishing?
You know cos  the woman I was with wanted to go for a swim and I said no you can't this guy , so I went up to him, I said what, what on earth are you fishing for?
He said, oh there's three congas live in this pool.
It was like  a four foot one, a five foot one, there's a six foot one over in the centre, there's a rock in the centre of it 
Oh right.
that came out the water  said look over there.
I said bloody hell!
You know, and I said to her you were  gonna go swimming in there !
He said ooh, he said  there was some American students here last week and they were all swimming in there and the  man came along with this thing and they bo they were all sat on the middle lo middle of there with their feet dangling in the water splashing away, he said  I was dragging this down and this six footer came out,I said, and then they were  he said, you've never seen anybody run so fast in your life like they go 
 
they were dangling their toes at the end of this thing .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh aye.
And then, the next day I went along and he actually caught  the five foot one  and ki and killed it and he gave us a load of steaks off it that I sort of 
Baked?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The trouble was they were really bony, that's the only thing it was  and I don't like eating
Well
fish and bo with bones in I can't stand it.
well you can't fillet them can you?
No.
No.
Impossible.
Impossible.
No.
Cos it's like a central spinal 
Yeah.
and it's all off it so  you'd be  just  you know, it's not like
Normal flat 
a fish, a flat fish.
I mean, but it was really nice it was  it was a really chewy meat you know.
But
Yeah.
like shark or something and er 
There's supposed to be decent congas off Beachy.
Is there?
You know the old
Mm.
oil .
Yeah.
It's me!
Down there.
Yeah.
Oh!
Plenty of rocks under there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
People say they've had some big ones.
Yeah.
But, you know about the stories you hear.
Yeah.
I've never actually seen one.
No.
They're ugly looking fish aren't they?
Bloody horrible fish!
But er  evil looking things.
This guy was great though we met in Ireland cos he was erm  he used to  own about three or four  supermarkets, er small chains and he just one day, he's about  he's about fifty eight, sixty now  and one day he said about five years ago he just got fed up and just walked out.
All he does is fish all day long.
And he 
Yeah.
just, he lives in somebody's basement of a house, and like, in return for living there  he fills the guy's freezer up with  lobster, crab, you know
Mm mm.
fish and that  and erm  everything he does in the village i in Kilrush is  everything, he just  you know, he wants a new pair of shoes, wants a coat  brings 
Yes.
a couple of lobster, you know, and things like tha cos like to him he, he's got his crab lines and his lobster pots all the time and all that.
Erm  to, it's really back to the old barter system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's superb!
Really good.
Eh!
Excuse me.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Have you not seen Ken?
No.
Oh! go and get Ken then.
Again?
Yeah.
You mean same as last week?
Yeah, yes!
Yes, yes, I was helping him.
What?
See, and I've helped Kenny out and a few  the lads before  and like we always finish it  that's why I come this cellar Barry.
Oh right.
Oh!
Do you want one?
Yeah 
Just one, just one.
go on, go on.
Just tell, send Alan down again.
Alan!
Said it's alright .
Have you ever tried octopus?
Erm  no.
Er  no I haven't.
No.
I mean, squid I've eaten a lot of.
Bit like that innit?
Squid.
Yeah.
I've had octopus soup.
That was quite  well  a weird taste.
I like shark.
Have you eaten shark?
No.
Oh I like shark, it's really nice cos it  it's really meaty, I mean, it's like eating meat.
Like steak though innit?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's like steak.
That's right.
It's nice and ju tender I believe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But
But it's sort of thick and chewy it's not, you know  it's not flaky like  fish, it's like a  almost like a meat.
It's really good.
They do in erm  where do they do it round here  always?
Erm  always got it in erm  tt  oh!
Mick   at Joseph's place, Mick  and Jose erm  in Lancaster.
Oh God!
Above  the Bang and Olufsen shop in Lancaster, d'ya know  Robertson's of Leicester?
Up King Street?
Yeah.
Next to Plato's.
Yeah.
The erm, electrical shop?
Yeah.
It's above there.
Oh!
So it's a  it's a nice place cos it's like  it  they do  a great spread of  I mean you can go for like a nice meal there, but you can like also  eat, you know  dips and 
Yeah.
hamburger 
Yeah.
or whatever, a big steak or whatever you want and the 
And how do you cook it?
They cook it i they cook it in er  Cajun, in, it's a, sort of, in a sort of spice  thing, they have sort of Mexican, not Mexican erm  tt  Cajun, South American, and 
Yeah.
some states of America  around the Mississippi  New Orleans 
Aha.
New Orleans .
Er  but I've had it just grilled, you know  and always done in butter.
In butter?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I like trying all these things now and again.
Mhm.
Mm.
You ca I mean you occasionally see it in the fish markets.
Yeah.
And er  I mean, things like squid and that I ca I quite like, but I'd never think of get buying it, I wouldn't  buy it and cook it myself or anything.
I just 
Oh no.
the trouble is, once you actually
Tried that
so what sorry?
I remember once, you know, getting and cutting  a rabbit and things, by the time you'd actually cut the thi damn thing
You've gone off it.
you'd gone off it cos you'd been  heading, and gutting it, and  whatever else !
And you know, you're sat there and you think
Yeah.
I don't  really wanna eat this, you know !
It's alright if it comes to you in a ca in a, in a, as a, as a meal 
Comes up ready-made.
Yeah.
But er, when you actually see what you're doing to it, you know.
I had this octopus once in Germany  and it, we'd gone out for a meal and  I was gonna have steak and mushrooms and 
Mm.
er, the lads said what are we having the starters like?
I said, oh  I'll have what you're ordering.
Well they ordered soup of the day you see  and they brought this, I tasted it  had a real funny, a weird taste
Mm.
anyway, and I sort of said to the waitress, why what was it?
She said octopus.
Urgh!
You wouldn't have had it if you'd have known?
No.
I don't think I would.
No.
It's not something 
No.
I would have picked.
No.
I wouldn't.
I certainly 
Well 
wouldn't.
it was  it were 
I mean I like fish but I wouldn't, I wouldn't choose it.
Had a funny taste but it was quite nice.
Yeah.
What was it, a sort of fishy ta I mean was it a sort of fishy soup?
No.
No?
It didn't have a fishy taste, it we like beef  but  I presume it's the way they've cooked it.
Mm.
Cos they all put spices in and everything.
But er  I definitely wouldn't have ordered it.
No.
No.
Like now, I don't think I would order it again.
Yeah.
But  then I had steak and mushrooms to follow.
Quite nice.
So if you don't eat what you catch  why choose 
Why do I wanna 
sea fishing?
No, I mean I, cos I, you know I,i I  spend a long time coarse fishing so I understand actual fishing  for pleasure as opposed to 
Yeah, yeah.
like to eat, you know, there's not much you can catch coarse fishing that you can eat anyway  erm but  most people who go sea fishing do it  to eat what they catch.
Or to sell what they catch or whatever, I mean 
Aha.
Mm.
I, I do it  I like, I like
But why sea fi why, why does sea fishing interest you and not coarse fishing sort of thing?
Because you  there's more opportunity for big ones
Mm.
if anything.
Mm.
Like, you go canal fishing, you know, you're only getting
Yeah, that's right.
like you get the odd four and half pound 
Yeah.
pike or chub 
Yeah.
whatever
Yeah.
but you know, you, you come to the fairly big'uns out there.
So 
Mm.
so I suppose that's why I do it.
Mm.
Yeah.
To see if I can get a big one.
Mm.
Can you get 
You going home?
away now?
No.
Nothing like trying to get rid of me is there!
Are you going home?
 
I'm no bother!
Is there more in this week than last week?
Yeah.
I've never seen as many bodies!
Yeah.
And I think my God !
Their brain must be scrambled as my daughter would say !
Yeah.
That's true.
Are they, still coming in then now?
No, there hasn't 
There hasn't been many now.
What 
You staying?

Twenty to one nearly.
Oh is it?
Oh!

See next Friday, we're coming next Friday for .
Ooh!
My little ratbag is.
She said I would 
No you'll enjoy that.
I'm gonna try and leave her here!
Let somebody else do her work.
We're trying to get rid of you 
Actually 
Anna!
it's good, I mean it's good because of the amount of lighting and effects that they bring, I mean it's interesting like, you know.
We come for  
But yo you come for an hour or so and then,tha that'll be enough 
That's enough.
you know, if you don't li if you're not into the music or into dancing then
Well, she is.
We're 
No.
not, we're all fogeys 
No.
you see.
That's right.
But she wouldn't like tonight because
No.
she's not into, what I call is it heavy metal?
Or summat like 
Yeah.
that, heavy rock 
Yeah.
or something?
Heavy rock.
Well, erm, she's not into that but 
Yeah.
I said we'd bring her.
She'll like it I think, she can dance.
Mind you, all these youngsters can't  but you can't see, you know normally when I stand at bar  I can normally see the  door but  I can't see it.
I know the feeling.
Ooh!
Feeling.
Do you normally have ?
Summat like that.
There'll be just over two hundred in.
Cor!
That's a lot then innit?
Did you get that change?
Well, I give it to what do they call him?
Hughey is it?
Hughey.
Yeah.
I gave it him.
I must  when I came a bit short again, I said
Yeah.
Well we changed fifteen quid last week didn't we?
Yeah, but I've been taking out, cos we had a rogue living above us you see, and I thought well  he's one of these that'll take owt if he can get it you see.
Mm.
So I thought I don't have a lot of money in flat, not that I have a lot, but  we like it out of way don't we?
The whisky bottle, we'll fill it up now won't we?
You never know, might get desperate again.
 
True.
Mind you 
But 
you were busy last night, is that what it was, did that knock you out?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Didn't you expect 
Yeah.
so many?
Er, no, no, we were, I mean last night we'd gone up from  the week before on a rave, we'd had about si ninety in, and last night we had about two hundred and fifty.
So
Is the, is the Fridays 
 
normally better than Saturdays  er, money-wise, the takings?
I mean, is it more 
Well it's i 
people in?
er, er er er, er  it, it hasn't been, I mean,i it, it was, last night was the first one that had gone on to like over two hundred.
So this week you've done well Friday and Saturday 
Yeah.
cos you've got more in.
That's right.
It's not bad though is it?
No.
No.
But I mean it's, now it's coming to the end of  January people are starting to get paid again and starting to have paid off their Christmas.
I mean that's been the killer.
You know, you've had Christmas, then you get hit with all your credit cards and all, then you get hit with all the  electricity, and gas, and telephone.
Electricity, gas and telephone and everything.
Can you explain why it's dearer on Fridays and Saturdays?
Cos it's  different type of  event and music.
You don't think if you 
 
if you put it up to same they wouldn't come likely?
No.
No.
So it's 
No.
No.
you don't complain at this, you don't complain at  two fifty er, each one, no?
No.
Well  some of them do.
Well some of them do, but not, not serious, not serious 
No I meant you don't, you're not bothered, you don't mind?
It's
No, I mean 
you make twice as much on a Friday on the door as you do on the Saturday.
No we don't  
No we don't cos we don't, we don't promote it you see on a Friday.
Oh!
So  they 
They 
don't promote cos they 
they pay for the hire of the hall.
They pay for the hire, yeah.
But you've gotta say, oh right.
So whatever they make on the door
Yeah.
after they've paid
Yeah.
for the hire  is profit.
But they spen they spend a lot of money on, on lights and they, I mean they  they spend  they spend about seven hours in here on a Friday just doing the lights and special effects and
I like that smoke one.
I saw it first time last week  and it were great!
Yeah.
Really 
Well the, the first time they were here when they  gonna have the all ni when they were gonna have the all-nighter  erm, they hired a laser in  it was superb!
But I mean that's  that'll cost them five hundred quid  alone  just for  
Are the all-nighters popular  with you, in here?
Well we 
Well you've had 
we ha 
a couple haven't you?
No we haven't.
The
None at all?
the  the police and the local authorities stop them.
I mean, I have had all-nighters  in the past
Yeah.
but that was for like the school trips so
Well why have they stopped it now?
you know  
There's nothing wrong with them.
What's to do with them?
Well it was in paper weren't it?
Well
Yeah, but  used to get away with it.
I know.
Yeah, but th th 
I know.
they're putting it down in the paper that
Mad, drugs.
people'll take drugs and stuff like that , well, if they're gonna take drugs , then they'll take it  anyway.
Well I've been here every week and there's no bother with them or 
No.
No, no.
Anyway 
Oh well 
you can't beat the system can you?
You can't.
And you can't beat the police cos sooner or later they will fight flipping hell to get you  
Well th they're just funny that's all.
Right.
Well  
Right, what?
That, I ordered that one.
Mm.

Putting them under their coats like.
How, how many  what  did you carry out yourself?
Tonight?
Yeah.
Five bottoms.
Well that's 
Well that 
half a case.
And I sold four of those as well like.
Yeah.
They carry out.
And I sold  three  three double gin  three  , you know.
Yeah but yo you always sell a few to take out don't 
Well that's why they brought it.
Most probably take out and sell them what's 
Yeah.
left at the end of the night.
I mean, not all our customers abs are absolutely stupid.
Buy a bottle at five to two and leave it at  two o'clock.
It's the nice ones that leave their drink there.
Mm!
I'm amazed they haven't 
Well anyway I was talking to er Rosette tonight cos I went to the office for some change and I, then I had this like.
She said, I hear the Empire, or, or hear The Garden's doing well on a Friday night.
Must have heard about that from Alan.
He goes  it's too fucking dead !
Well it's  it, last day of week  
Where?
Popping up to Christies and just after you go up the top.
No, no, no, where?
Where are you talking about?
The Empire?
But apparently they're doing quite well on a Wednesday  with the students.
Students, yeah I know.
And erm  Mark was in last week he said 
They're getting six hundred like.
well, Mark said it was, Mark er guessed about four hundred.
He's, he, he went in last week, he went in this week  and er 
Well Paul, Paul said to me six hundred , about seven hundred 
Yeah.
normally he said, he said well there would be about six hundred.
Ni Nigel mentioned, he told me it was erm  er like four, five hundred in  tt  to
Not bad though is it?
Well it's very good innit?
I mean, on a Wednesday.
And it's only a quid to get in and it's a pound, pound a pint.
Two quid and, and a drink, yeah.
But on the other hand they're making a little bit at a pound a pint.
Well they're making five or six hundred, they're bound 
 
to be getting on with it.
That's right.
That's getting in the 
 
I don't think they've got a lot of staff on.
I wouldn't have thought they'd bother with a 
No.
student night, having a lot of staff on, it's pointless having  ah, I mean, the bouncers  in that situation.
Well you'd only need one.
But we don't need a bouncer on 
Except, mind you, the, the rough, the erm rugby club gave the band a bit of er, a rough  seeing to.
What band?
He had some band that were  awful apparently and the 
 
whole of the rugby team were lying in front of stage with their 
They, they've never left, they were playing the rugby club?
fingers up.
No, no, no, no, no.
No!
University
University rugby club.
Oh!
The Uni's?
Yeah.
Mhm.
Yeah.
The band went  ran off in tears apparently.
Couldn't cope.
Seeing the University Rugby Club I would, I would have eh!
Mm.
Must be some narky bastards in the rugby club! 
Oh!
I can't get it out it's stuck on his collar I hope she comes back for it next week.
But six hundred on a Wednesday night that's pretty good.
Mm.
Does the Sugar House get that many people in?
No.
No.
The Sugar House only opens er  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
Or, or,o we always have done.
I mean, we  we opened originally, first year, every night of the bloody week and it was pointless, absolutely pointless.
Is that bigger than the Empire?
I've never been in it?
Yeah.
No!
Er  yeah.
Yes it is.
Is it?
It's legal, it's legal 
Well it's on, it's on a Thursday, yeah.
it's  it's legally bigger than the Empire but the Empire can get more people in cos he's got upstairs and 
Yeah.
that 
Mm.
see.
But, of course, erm for licensing they don't take that  particularly into consideration up there.
Well they half upstairs  straight away.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So er 
I mean, I think, I, I think the Empire legally is  well I thought it was nine hundred
Seven fifty I think.
I can't think er   I don't know.
I think it's nine hundred.
I mean you could cer you could 
Well I thought it was seven fifty.
certainly get seventeen, eighteen hundred in there.
Well yeah.
Even that Bob Monkhouse opened up  quite 
Yeah.
quite nice.
Yeah.
Well, they'll have the  Garden won't they?
Oh yeah.
Mind you 
Probably, fucking tell by, cos there was  I thought 
They we 
there was too many.
Yeah.
But I mean they were banging  they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first
Mm.
few months weren't they?
No, twelve, twelve or thirteen.
They never had fifteen.
Didn't they?
I mean the Sugar House, his capacity's 
 
just been  upped to eleven hundred I think.
Erm  I mean, it was always nine hundred, but it's been upped to eleven hundred last year I think.
Well we used to put, I mean, I put twelve, thirteen hundred in the Sugar House.
But tha but you  it's full at that, you know.
Mm.
Whereas the, the, the, you, you could  you could, you could fit sixteen, seventeen hundred.
No, I reckon,th th there was,th th they reckon between a, a thousand and e eleven hundred for a   night, you know.
But you couldn't fucking move at that.
Yeah, but it was a, it was also a ver it was a bit of a celebrity, I mean it was  people, people were crushed around, bloody hell I mean 
Yeah, that's right.
, yeah.
all the downstairs, I mean all the plebs were upstairs  all the downstairs was erm
Yeah but,ma maybe, maybe a hundred people .
Mm.
I'm sure.
I mean, I don't know I, you see I left  I had to come here so I left before Bob Monkhouse and everything, I just, I, all I did was go for  couple of free drinks and plate of free food, which, I don't think I got.
And left.
You get a few fucking  with the chef.
You know  deep sea diving at  
Yes you would.
You, you betrayed us then, you'd left hadn't you?
You'd left me!
I had to leave.
You'd fled us!
And gone to work for the opposition.
Were you op well I didn't reckon you were opposition.
But I did go out or something.
Just cos you thought you were go 
It's funny though 
just cos you, you were coming out with about two hundred and fifty quid a week for working seven nights a week!
No, I, originally, they they were open seven nights a week.
I know.
No.
Was it four times a week?
And you were secured  weren't you secured there?
Mm.
Oh!
Seven nights a week, two hundred and fifty in my pocket guaranteed.
Going to bed with Jean  fucking, fucking shite!
Kelly's  !
Christ!
Some of the schemes they come up with.
Get your blood going.
I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll be interesting to see how they  they start next week with a  a load of er  bands on Thursday nights.
Mm.
I mean, they're all chartsey stuff but 
Mm.
you know, I, I da that kind of stuff doesn't draw punters  generally, chart stuff cos  the people who go
I dunno, I think the young 
the people who are interested
I think the young people go to it like.
Well me yeah, maybe.
Maybe some of that will.
Yeah.
But generally pop, poppy type 
A lot, a lot of  
Top of the Pops stuff doesn't, in the sense that  people who like to go and see live music don't  people who like that kind of music prefer the dis prefer it in a 
Yeah.
disco context.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not, not, seeing sort of a live concert.
Anyway
In fact, in fact most of the stuff they don't like anyway.

Most teams do  in  F A.

Well, second division teams.
No they don't.
They've planted a new tree there haven't they?
Where?
There.
Where?
The one right in front, at the very
Well that's been there ever since we moved in!
No, not that bush.
I mean that 
No, the tree.
Yeah.
Has it?
Yeah.
Well I can't remember that  now.
Unless it was small and  it's grown !
So when  you don't know when you go back in then?
The time the trains are?
Nope!
Could do that 
They're getting some more tomorrow aren't they?
I don't know yet.
Cos in  you don't know if it'll be moved by then.
Cos she said they're moving it aren't they?
From his bedroom.
Yes.
That'll take about ten minutes .
Oh it would.
If more comes  in.
Do you want me to get that?
No, I'll get it.
What, what he's, what he's had to say is, is, is to, is to get the ball rolling and get some money, and then we can start looking.
He'll give us that 
Mm.
without any security.
Mm.
Can have that for starters.
At a write off of thirty pound a barrel.
Oh!
He's going to write off one as well?
This is what he's saying, yeah.
S so you don't get involved or anything, this is, we can just sign it off.
All he wants off us, we're gonna give him analyses of your last three months' invoices.
Right.
Right?
And then wants just some form of a business plan, which 
Mm.
is probably similar to what your 
Yeah.
Yeah.
What you did that, on that other thing.
And then, and he'll come and see us, sort it all out, sort the installation out and erm  and, and 
 
we've got fifteen left.
Then we then he says, then wha well cos what we're saying is, then if your barrelage goes up to four barrels, say
Mm.
go back and get another ten to fifteen 
Another write off.
Mm.
er another write off.
He says, so you you you you you're not, you're not  stinging yourself up to something  er 
Mm.
and you take as you improve the business.
It's whether, you know, what we've got to look at really is what, what, basis we can use that fifteen thou for.
Mm.
That's right.
As a starter.
That's right.
You know.
The biggest thing is a case of refurbishment to, is that, that's what we want.
That cocktail bar looks alright in the corner over there.
Mm.
Then you could sort of do something with the 
Yeah.
 
Yeah.
Bas let's wander round and have a look.
I mean 
Mm.
Er do you want, there's another the idea of what that ?
What do you think on that Barry, on that score?
Yeah.
If we can get fifteen quickly.
Yeah.
Cos we've missed the March he said, because th it's the new financial year so
Aha.
Aha.
you know, so if we can ge if we can get fifteen in quickly we can start saying well look, while 
Mm.
we're gonna spend that fifteen 
Yeah.
for
That's right.
And then get it going.
Anyway, I said  we'll have to .
Yeah.
I mean, basically, blokes have written everything off.
Yeah.
So, so  I mean, they've just walked 
Yeah.
away from the whole thing, so 
So 
with all the pumps, heads,
All yo all 
cellar, everything!
all we're gonna have to do is, put that in, well  we might 
Yeah.
we might, we might, what money we're saving we might be able to say well what about something 
Yeah.
you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We will turn round, but I say
We, we own this, you know, d'ya wanna buy it, can, d'ya wanna buy the equipment?
Mm.
They might say well, put new in, you know, but  gonna save them an arm and a leg and maybe we can  ah, either negotiate something definite or 
Well it's not, it's, I mean it's not only the cost of the equipment, it's actually the cost of pu installing it.
You know, you need 
That's right, yeah.
to have a company in to install it.
won't need to push
Gonna be, it's gonna be  I mean, it's a long run, it's, it's 
Yeah.
gonna be a good two days
Yeah.
wanted to do that.
Well they, they'll put a condition on as well.
Have a word with Colin.
Yeah.
Right.
Here we are.
Here we are backstage.
Erm  that's just cupboard, staff toilets, and spirit stuff  in there.
Yeah.
area 
Sa what's that for?
Ice making machine.
Oh yeah!
That's what we want a 
Dishwasher.
glass washer.
Erm  there's one freezer, that's a freezer.
Er  it's small but  well it's a reasonable kitchen 
Yeah, it's quite a good one 
int it?
really.
Fridge.
They do say that er, that the er  it's
cos you have to anything on there, food-wise.
Yeah, you've got to have food anyway.
So I mean, if they've had it.
But 
Mm.
I mean it's, it's  er, it needs somebody working at it  full time
Yeah.
erm  and just being, being prepared to su suffer a few months of building 
Yeah.
it up basically.
Yeah.
That's, that's the, that's where you've got  er  freezer  freezer  and a chest freezer there as well.
That's a lift straight down to the cellar.
Who put that in?
Charlie .
Tha I mean the whole building's brand new, he, well 
Yeah.
I mean it's, what?
Er  eight years 
Yeah.
old or whatever.
Er, we've got all packed in for  I mean that might be worth  putting back on.
No.
Doubt 
When it 
if it's
when it got to the stage that we only open like, one and a half days a week
Yeah.
we said, well it's not really worth, from your company's point of view, such an expensive piece of  equipment for a  I mean,was doing the process thing then, you know, we could utilize the equipment elsewhere.
But, er, if you're not really gonna be   still like split cups but  well 
Yeah.
it's, it's useful for the gas sort of thing 
Oh yeah.
Whatever, whatever  
I mean  we'll 
Yeah.
be expecting that.
Yeah.
Well yo do your 
So 
do, do you know?
Oh yeah!
 
Yeah, I know that.
Well when everything's sorted, that's it.
So you got, there's a lot of wasted space in this club.
Mm!
Phenomenal amount of wasted space.
Yeah.
I used to think what .
Where does this lead to?
This is the back of the, the disco.
Yeah.
Right, there was a disco 
 
console  on the back.
Mm.
Right.
Aye.
And I got, I've got about  two hundred of these  poly-foam chairs as well back 
Yeah.
there, which  I got off one of my  
Here's the piano.
That's the piano.
And these are .
Yeah .
I mean we have  on a couple of occasions always done like fortieths and that, on a  couple of them.
We actually set up  buffet in there
Mm.
which worked  reasonably well.
Mm.
I think one did it, you know what I mean
Yeah.
tart it up and whatever.
Mm.
Erm, and what else worked well  erm  for a while, we were doing the women's darts.
And we had  about three boards in here and we had a board in there.
I mean, there must be about seven boards in all.
Right.
Was that a competition was it?
No, it was a weekly  thing.
Because, what they were doing, they were going to individual pubs
Oh yeah.
Which couldn't cope
Yeah.
with it, and th wha on their knock-outs and their cups and everything they 
Yeah.
wanted them all in one place.
So
Aha
but erm  there was a bit of jealousy in the la licensees started getting a bit er  er
Mm.
because we're taking the trade away from them, you know  they would have obviously had 
They were all the other pubs and the darts ?
Yeah.
They'd have had a lot .
A bit of competition from other place.
Well, at that stage we were talking to  the men's darts secretary came along and was saying, he'd be quite interested in, in  knocking up, you know, one of the Lancashire matches or something 
Oh!
like that.
It's a 
Well it's the stage for it int it?
Th thing is, you can put it on there, put it on sta you can er film it, and bang it on the big screen over there.
Mhm.
which is what I, I, in the  I had Eric Bristow and Maureen  one night, and, I mean, it was just little dart board in the corner, but what I did was, I had a big screen like that  and I just got  student television service just to film it live and just throw it straight back up onto the big 
Yeah.
onto the thing, so  you know, it was like  well it's better than being at the telly.
I mean, it's better 
Mm.
than
Watching that.
because th on the telly they haven't got those.
I mean, I'm 
Mm.
amazed at the, on the world championships, they've only got those  lighting up boards 
That's right.
haven't they?
That's right, yeah.
You know, and, I, instead of having  I mean 
Screen up.
why they don't just put a screen up 
Yeah.
that beats me, you know.
They do other sport etcetera.
See what I mean?
Mm.
Yeah.
Well that's part of the course because, we need to sort, with Johnny's entertainment out with a roof.
Yeah.
Alright.
They've got two or three 
 
little leaks.
What it is is, the ventilation  on the roof, ventilation shafts  when the wind's driven  it drives under and leaks through.
And we get it in two or three places, the toilets are, are the key one.
And you don't see  with that.
Roof tiles are a fu bloody cost a fortune!
Yeah, so  damn!
I didn't bring the  I'll, I'll go and  I'll go and get the key for that.
No, I'll let you see it, may as well while you're here.
You can see floor
What's the floor, underneath the floor?
Concrete.
I think, what, what  you mean 
What is 
the actual car it's just carpet.
You see it was out in the, probably is still out in the hall that one.
 
Yeah.
I mean,closed now, it 
Mm.
was open when Colin was there that time of the day.
Yeah.
You know, you'd have ten, they say 
Yeah.
ten, if there was only ten people in, they'd all be drinking six or seven 
Yeah.
pints.
You haven't got a cold shelf in here.
But I mean, that wouldn't be 
No.
that's not that difficult to put in here.
We'll get them 
Yeah.
Exactly.
I think we'll be able to get them to put them in for us.
No.
Yeah.
Oh we've gotta pay that one  haven't we?
To pay that one?
I think so, yeah.
We've got two coming  for ourselves, but
Yeah.
Yeah.
we'll be able to get them off Gary I think, yeah.
And we'll be able to say look, we want, we want  how man how many have you got behind there?
Have you got cold shelves behind there?
We've got, one, two, three, four behind there.
Right.
So we could get a couple for here 
Yeah.
couldn't we?
Yeah.
And you're painting over that.
I've gotta come and paint
I mean, really, if, if you look fifteen thousand, if you could spend fifteen thousand doing all this up
Ah yeah.
and you could write off barrels, you could still improve your barrel er, your barrels a week int it?
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
You need, er you need to
Definitely.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And you don't need  say, you don't need, you only need like  one private function a week.
And promotions, you know, Malibu promotion night where the 
Do promotions, that's right.
Yeah.
And yo and your er  see what I mean about this area up here, I mean it's not a bad  thingy.
No.
No I mean, I don't think 
Just time to sit and have a drink and all that.
Well
I mean, if you wanted you can use the big screen.
You see cos, we put it that position cos er, the only dead part of the club is just  literally 
Yeah.
in the corner.
O the other way you can see the screen from everywhere.
Erm
I mean, how much do you reckon it'll cost?
If we said ou the carpet, we said well a certain area of the carpet wants  
 
Yeah.
Erm
I mean, it's quite a big floor area  when you look at it.
How much did you say 
Yeah, probably.
in all your nightclubs and, what did you say they do a ?
We'll  nothing, we'll, won't be able to paint the floor and put the carpets down on 
I mean I 
that floor.
I would have thought  to be honest, I would have thought you don't need any of that area
No.
carpeted.
Just to, probably, very ends of  
Don't you, you want your raised area, this 
You want your two raised areas carpeted.
Er, by, by the bar would you say it  no not right in front 
 
you know, have that 
Yeah.
running to about three foot back.
Yeah.
Yeah that
Well
but you don't really want it up to the bar if you're going to get 
No I'm saying that 
 
you go right up to the bar
Yeah.
you want it up to 
See if you put artists on  and you have this area as  some kind of  without carpet on
Mm.
in some ways, you haven't put, you can actually be, you know, dancing on this area.
I mean,tha that's the problem we got at the moment.
Yeah.
On Mary's do, what we did, I put  soul machine over here where the screen was
Yeah.
so people could dance on the er  on the actual dance floor if they wanted.
Erm  I mean, it's not ideal but it really, it worked.
It wor even, providing you haven't got a lot of  if you've only got about a hundred people it's not too bad that cos it, it  also creates a bit more atmosphere.
But, it's a better  i it's not a  bad designed place in a sense that, that  I mean, it's a reasonable size room
Mm.
and you ca and three hundred people er, you can take three hundred quite 
Yeah.
easily  I mean, you know, we've had four, fives  hundred in.
Mm.
You can take three hundred quite easily.
But  the erm  the other thing about it is if you have a hundred people in  it can be so also be a good atmosphere, you know?
Mm.
Yet,i it's not one of those rooms where, if 
No.
you only get a hu yo you're struggling if you've only a got a hundred.
Yeah.
Erm, what I'm, I've just arranged somebody to redo our speaker syste our original system with tannoys, we blew our tannoys  speakers, and  I didn't bother getting them replaced because we were going for a rock crowd  so we just used Bernie and Nigel
Mm.
P A there.
Yeah.
What I've got, is I've got four of these directional speakers, there's two up and two on here  and then two big bass ones which sit on a floor back there.
And, so it's very loud on the dance floor but you can actually talk out, out here.
Mm.
Which I thought we need to redo if we're gonna get private bookings.
Yeah.
Cos the one thing you always get when you've got a mixture of people, I mean, all thi this needs recovering basically as well.
Yeah.
But I mean, that's not a big job it's just 
No.
re relinoing it basically.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Filling the smoke 
Smoke machine 
up.
Yeah, you got a smoke machine  we, we, we would set in little, in a hole in the back.
And all of these air conditioning valves are on?
Yeah.
Mm.
Actually I'm having the,a th I mean I can get, I'm getting our system back in operation.
It, it was gonna cost me a thousand but I've done a deal with a guy who'd got stuck with some in Manchester so it's gonna cost me five hundred which I'm getting done this Friday.
Erm  to put a satellite  system, to put a satellite in would be three hundred quid in total.
Yeah.
So  I mean it's  that's only one  that's only one good'un, good night using it innit, a year?
Pays for that.
Yo you're light, the er ceiling  could you not get away with covering the, get the lights a colour blue?
And er  and  you know, tidying up ceiling obviously  
Right.
I mean, there's lots of bits and pieces you need for  a 
I mean, if you just  cover all the areas that were really 
Yeah.
bad, er  I reckon, I says, well what do you think  yourself in, in, in
Well the, the big  the single biggest cost is, is what we do with this  a carpet area.
Mm.
That's our single biggest cost, cos  as I say, I had three quotes in total, and they were all sort of between thirteen and twenty three.
Yeah.
Thousand.
Yeah.
But that's, having said that, that's to carpet all this area 
Yeah.
that back area I've just taken you through, that, the staircase, and the corridors out there.
I mean, that's the carpet ev I just said like  I wanted a quote to carpet 
Mm.
everywhere.
Erm  what we were doing is,i what it was for, was for, for prospective buyers, they wanted erm  a justification for 
Yeah.
Yeah.
the money they were gonna spend.
I mean, they wouldn't have spent that money.
But, they wanted  written quotes for  a justification more or less.
Do you think it's better being like this?
Looking there, or is it better sort of, clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and
Well it's quite, it's a reasonable size 
I know it's a fair size, but  
It's a fair size dancing 
you know 
space actually, I mean, you get about a hundred people on here, it's, it's, it's alright.
In fact the, in fact it's,i at times it's too big.
That's, my one, I don't know how you'd ever get over it, but that's my one  criticism of the thing is that sometimes when you walk in  it's the first thing that hits you and unless people are dancing  it creates a cold atmosphere.
Yeah.
Erm
I mean, if you've got your group on  there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on  the floor at, at, in front of the group kind of thing like 
Yeah, but I mean a a if you have any
anything like a, a, a group takes all of this.
Yeah.
If you have a
That's right.
a main group up, you know 
Yeah.
you're struggling to get
But then if you did this floor space like 
Yeah.
we said
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I, I actually don't think you need carpet on  I mean I, I don't 
Oh no.
think, I don't think you need any of this carpet, to be honest.
black , would that look nice?
Black  carpet.
I dunno.
Ah, cos Peter was saying, I dunno, I dunno  what the  black .
Don't have to be black , you just want, you want something that er  I don't know really, you'd have to think about it wouldn't you?
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Could do with probably somebody who knows what they're doing on it.
You want the carpet area full of seating 
Actually one thing Barry 
Yeah.
don't you?
That's right.
Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting right 
Yeah.
down.
the area.
That's one thing Ben  said though, which was quite useful, he said get some people down  pick their brains.
Mm.
You know, let them come down and give a quote 
Mm.
for whatever you're looking at 
Mm.
and pick what they thought, was the best thing you could do, and then don't, don't tell you but  get them made.
Yeah.
You know, and like 
That's right.
I say it, these guys are working on this all the time.
I mean, on a normal night  it's, the raised areas fill up with people  seated.
Yeah.
This area's er, everybody's stood around.
Yeah.
I mean,i i it's a while before these chairs are,the they're always the last ones these  to sit 
Yeah.
down cos you're in the middle of  the thoroughfare.
You know,i i you need to be full to fill up that area because  well, you know yourself, people like to stand around the bar don't they?
Mm.
Oh!
That's right, yeah.
So, I mean, all you do is get, I mean this  and this has been down  well it's, obviously it's been down since it opened, now I can't remember when Brewer actually opened 
Mm.
but it must be seven years ago.
If we've been 
Nearly seven or eight year ago weren't 
Yeah.
it?
I mean we've been in three.
Yeah, it'll be about eight, eight year ago.
It was closed for a 
I wonder 
year.
I wonder how ma had to  to town, I come down from across the town.
I don't know .
It's getting the steam roller up that worries me.
 
Well you 
the time after  don't it?
Mm.
Well, I mean, I don't know how to find the other one out.
You only have to paint the dance floor on then don't you?
I wonder how much it would cost the town, like?
I know it sounds silly, but I say, the silly things like that are the ones that sometimes  are the 
Mm.
ones that are took seriously.
But like you say, the floor can stand it and there's nice little corner  or whatever int there?
I don't know.
That was rather a cheekiest thing to do.
Mm.
I mean, a er  a, you see ou a good, a good looking, hard wearing wo lino
Yeah.
might not
Yeah.
go amiss.
Cos then you can just, just mop it down, brush it or whatever, you don't even 
Yeah.
need to bother vacuuming, which takes time, is a pain in the neck and  you can never get a vacuum that's any good anyway.
And plugs.
they might look er  you know they look cheapy or
No.
sort of 
But you 
lino being
No, they do, but you can get good ones now can't you?
Ah yeah!
I mean, you can get ones that look like  I just wonder whether you can get ones that look like sort of  parquet floors almost?
I've seen  these industrial companies and he said look, have you got any er  of your older stuff 
What's that?
Because Polly's got a  it was at the front of the bar, it's quite a heavy duty thing int it that?
Mm.
It'll take fag burns and, you want something that's not gonna  that's like, that's got li like that crystaley stuff 
Mm.
innit?
And, and it's non-slip 
Yeah, that's er, that's good.
That's the stuff 
Mm.
you
It's a non-slip stuff.
want, but I would have thought that'll be quite dear won't it?
You know, that kind  with all the grit 
Yeah I know.
I like that.
in it .
I wonder if you went to the industrial companies, and said look, have you got a  a, a, a big lot of something and
Yeah, well that'll be alright.
You know.
Well do,ja er, I mean er  is it Marnes do that floor covering?
 
Yeah but that was for carpets, was it,i is, is, is that, do they do the floor coverings there?
Yeah.
Course it's still  
Or is it  Storeys or 
Yeah.
Yeah, they do the floor covering.
Find out.
Yes.
I think we'll just work out
I've never been to that have you?
That, that'll be that  and a, and a lick of paint
Yeah.
and then you're, you're half way there.
Th 
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yo your main job is to see th 
 
I mean 
see the bar open and 
th yeah.
I mean,th the, the other thing is we need, we need it  we need it recovered  in something that's  but I mean that's not a massive  job, and we, and we, and I want the toilet trough  that sort of thing.
Yeah, all that sort of thing.
What's the ladies like?
The ladies are alright.
Yeah, they're alright.
Don't need, I mean  if we get somebody in to do that, we'd have somebody in do little bits of repairs here and there, but generally it's alright.
I'll show you .
See, there's a tremendous amount of wasted space there!
Mm.
And Jean's corridor.
Jean's corridor.
I resume, see if  the places are .
It, and we had ninety on it on Saturday.
Bus dri bus driver nearly we nearly hit the  the thing nearly keeled over cos he didn't realize how many he'd got upstairs and he went round the bend and it started to go.
And then  cos you're not supposed to stand up upstairs .
See the crack int bog.
Yeah.
I think it's got a bit damaged on Saturday, then he put him back
Supposed to lift base.
But er  generally needs
Oh I know.
Yeah.
Aye.
The trouble is, toilets are toilets and they don't  and they 
Oh aye.
get damaged, I mean, you just have to keep  bloody working on them, I
That's nice, in the toilet.
Yeah, take them in.
That's right mate.
As I say, it needs cleaning up of graffiti and a little bit of adjustment and
Yeah.
This is the problem, er,le 
Yeah.
leaking roof.
Cos these bloody tiles are expensive!
Yeah.
They keep getting damaged and collapsing, and of course, it's part of the fire protection as well , so
You've got to be er
Yo they've got, you know,yo you're not supposed to have damaged ones and we, you know, for an inspection we have to get th we'd have to, oh
Yeah.
change all these.
Well what about, what, what  who's responsible?
Is it, John is?
John is.
Yeah, but I mean  you know, at the moment we've not been pushing anything till
No.
I mean, everything's sorted out, then I will.
Yeah.
I think what it probably needs, is just a guard round the top ventilation things
Yeah.
cos a they're open and  the wind drives under it.
Well it  and shut up to there with  and that you can 
Ah yeah.
try them holes 
Yeah.
in there 
Yeah.
with special sealer.
But I mean 
That's right.
That's right.
That's what I mean, and we'll be alright.
See  this is er  that goes along here.
. But what I wanna do is trough this and bury these pipes.
Yeah.
Cos er, you just get damage all the time in here.
And I got  Tony  coming to do these now.
Yeah.
Put these under there.
Somebody's pulled the sink off.
Mind you if you do that  your only problem then is your roof int you?
Yeah.
You just 
Yeah.
You just put a lick of paint again,wo your tiling's awful int it?
Yeah.
But 
I mean 
Yeah.
It's all there.
Well if you in you can see the diff I mean, you've got what  seven urinals there?
But if you troughed all in an L
Yeah.
I mean you'd take  could take twenty guys stood there.
I mean,damage is being done, say you have got seven guys there stood, what's 
Mm.
the other one doing, I think can, can pull 
Yeah.
this off.
Yeah.
I know.
So they've nothing better to do.
You got them on trough, then they're saying alright we'll do it somewhere else.
Yeah.
Then the longer you got them in here they're likely 
That's right.
to
That's right.
There's enough here  for a trough .
Oh aye.
Well, I dunno, it's go it's got, I was showing th I was showing the licensing people round  erm  the inspection of, Jean we Jean wasn't here, we were looking round and  fire brigade and that were there and   inspection, we turned round and all written across is  Jean  is a fucking fat cow!
Alright !
I mean, I mean you tried  not to laugh  
 
we tried desperately to avoid looking at her,right .
And the environmental health guy there and all.
Well they probably thought you wrote it  
Yeah !
Looks like they're not getting on.
This was a good idea of Johnny's  which they did, which  did  before  was this corridor, these lights up here  that one when it's re-doing, but there's one, two, three, four, five, six  and they framed  a large advertising poster.
Mm.
Mm.
And so, like hundred quid a year
Yeah.
for
Yeah!
For putting it 
It could be a 
out.
I mean it's six hundred quid for doing nothing innit?
That's right.
Six is it?
Oh.
Erm, you know  er, I can't remember who they are, but it wasn't clientele, but I mean we could, you know we could
Yeah.
look around for.. the relevant er
That's right.
And how much of this stuff's down?
I mean, this'll have been down I, oh, won't be able to get as much wear  
Yeah.
This is, this is, this is
original as far as I know.
Did you lay that yourself?
Yeah.
A little bit   
Do they just seem to stick on tap or is it a row?
No, no, no this is a row.
A row.
Yeah.
The stuff that's  that's the stuff you want.
This is, it is not the similar stuff like we've got in the kitchen upstairs?
No.
No.
That rug stuff.
It is er, it's er 
Mm.
a actually it is like that stuff.
But it's different.
It wasn't here was it?
Same 
No.
sort of thing.
No.
Maybe that's the type of thing you want on the floor.
I reckon that is.
That is it.
In there.
Make, do some more er  extend the er er er er parquet flooring area to give you more dance room.
An and, and round the  other areas which
Up here.
and keep the carpet on the high  seating areas.
Oh aye.
Yeah.
I think it's better up there.
Oh yeah.
Aye, but it wouldn't cost very much to carpet those two areas.
No.
I think you do, you know, do something 
Yeah.
Yeah.
a little bit better, but I mean
 
but it, you just need something that's ro that's hardwearing and
And practical really, isn't it?
you know.
As I say, people aren't going in in there to look at, oh! what a pretty carpet you've got.
No.
Oh no!
As long as it's, as long as it, it's  warm 
Well if you remember most of the time the lights are off.
Yeah.
It's only to create an impression when you're doing it in the day time.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean, I don't know whether you've thought any more about that  idea that Colin had, but, I mean, I don't know,yo cos you haven't  said you do, you haven't really looked round it.
No, that's right, you know, the, the, the only thing we've, we've  actually gonna trying to get that into a  the bar  is er    segregate 
Perhaps er  Jean's left actually .
 
This is  this was  the, the cloakroom and what we were  what we were intending doing originally
is turn it into an office.
Mm.
I mean, we haven't done  so far but we, that's what  but, this is stuff we got  about hundred 
Oh yeah.
and fifty quid for two massive rolls like this.
Mm.
Well that's, well that's what not ba bad is it for those int 
Mm.
it?
Yeah.
I mean that's what Jean's talking about getting.
Mm.
That's alright int it?
Oh to  but that  will fit  is a bit 
Well er 
bit more thickness than I hoped, er  but if it's sat on top of there and  on top of what's on.
On top of what's on?
Right.
I don't know whether they were actually sitting right where the bevel or whatever.
I know this sort of stuff is  we had similar to when I worked in the shop  er, used to, he had three quarters of this, guy come round in a van or whatever, back of a van 
Yeah.
and he laid it himself.
Mm.
and by the entrance and whatever er 
I think you'd have to get a  professional carpet 
So 
layer just, just to make certain.
Summat like that really, is, is obviously
Yeah.
And it's just stuck on int it?
Yeah.
I mean i er  I, I spent  as I say 
 
spent the best part of the year working  in here, sort of nine to five type  thing  and it's  mind walking down that bottom end  without any ar without any natural light.
Mm.
Mm.
That little office, you know, so I said to Jean, you know, well let's turn this into an office
Yeah.
basically.
Erm
No I can  did you have a cloakroom then?
Or did you  
No.
I mean we u when we, when we use,whe the, the rave used this as a cloakroom.
Erm  but I mean there are, there are other areas you can use.
Mm.
And you can use  you could use past that erm  cos that's the other thing I haven't shown you, is, is  this is all ours as well down the bottom end.
Erm  and that's the other thing about having  having, sort of, a lot of people thinking it  having, having it  as a sort of rock club at night  they, they regard it as their own, sort of thing 
Oh right.
I mean, so when we do have to do redecoration we just gotta let the volunteers in.
Yeah.
Left a, a crate of Pils for them and carry on painting everything.
Right this is er  that's  the snooker  next door 
Next door.
Yeah.
It's alright, I'll knock it off.
You don't need to knock, connect it through.
That's the garden sign which blew off in the  gales before Christmas and landed on Uri  's car.
Erm  
What you didn't do it?
Yes !
That's Breakers in there is it?
That's Breakers in there.
Erm
Is this an entrance as well?
It can be.
Down the bottom  that just goes out to the bottom and there's a back
Yeah.
erm
Yeah.
I see that there.
And it's got a sign over the 
Yeah.
back with a light if you 
Yeah, I've seen that, yeah.
want it, cos we were  you know, we were thinking i we wanted to leave ourselves that option.
I mean, we were thinking about like the Sunday markets and things.
Yeah.
You know, utilizing, except it's a long drag for people, but, but, you 
Mm.
know, anyway.
Cleaner's room  two dressing rooms, and a toilet.
I mean, they're dressing rooms or offices or whatever you want basically, I mean
What about there?
Ye er that's er, this is just a cleaner's, cleaner's cum store room, you know, the usual
Mm.
crap.
Erm  I don't know whether these are open.
I'll give you a key.
Keep them all locked.
You'll find 
Er 
This is for changing rooms?
So this is a  
Yeah.
there  casual act.
I mean we, cos we've 
Sort of.
not been putting on any loud music recently I've not had, I'll stretch it out a little bit, but erm  you know, we had a heater in here and  er, record player and er ra er  radio and that.
Yeah.
I mean, it's a got extra padding on.
Well that's right, I mean, you know, it, it  when, when it was erm  oh what's that cook who had
Found the place
er  tt  he's now got that place in Lancaster, the er  what was the Trade and Labour club in Lancaster.
Oh!
Ton Peter ?
Yeah, Peter , when he had it, he had er  double bed in there with bolts on the inside of the door.
Did he?
Yeah.
Is he?
People have often called  
They say there's 
Cos Caesars are in there now.
Oh are they?
Yeah.
Oh!
Doesn't 
Yeah.
surprise me.
You'll be getting  what is it in, they can't open now they've lost the er, they've lost some of er, they've lost some sort of .
Yeah I know, but it's, it's, it's  summat  
Aye.
Right.
So that's  round it
So the easiest thing really is obviously  is if I get the thing sorted out  and then, turn it 
Yep.
around and er  we've had a word with  Elliel this morning.
Mm.
Yeah.
Erm  they  they're quite happy with  with all that sort of stuff.
Yeah.
They're gonna come up  are you free on Fri Thursday afternoon at four o'clock?
Thursday's a busy day for us really.
Five o'clock's fine, but  four o'clock's probably .
But I,th th they're actually supposed to get Friday rush
Mm.
and then you really should  with the staff we've 
Yeah.
got.
So 
Er

I mean 
What so, so ba as la as towards five o'clock as, as possible.
If we got here, if we got  if we got  to fa wherever you wanted to meet, where do you want to meet?

I think the biggest thing really is just like they say, is how much you can get that done for   and, get the roofing done, that's gotta be done.
Yeah.
Er 
Yeah.
some paper  them toilets  cos er, I'm, you know, I say, from our  our, both side is  something that's er  I mean, everybody's looking purely from  and return sales.
All you're looking at is for an income , an income from it  and er  I reckon  can do very well.
What do you, what you think of that bar area Barry?
Do you think it could be inclined to be 
Er, the top one?
as a drinking area 
Yeah.
U yeah, I mean I
during the day?
yeah, well it was  it was what I wanted to, it was what I wanted to, it was wanted to do initially, I mean, but then you have like  so many ideas  that
Yeah.
you know, you can't do them all in that sense, but if you had somebody  somebody like Colin might be able to
Cos you only need, you only need  him to drag  sort of  fifteen, twenty people in initially
And five, ten of them 
And they'll all, they'll all be drinkers.
Yeah.
But I mean  sa ta so there's an at little atmosphere there anyway
Yeah.
erm  and then you can, I mean, well it gives you the opportunity to, you know  bang in a bloody jazz band or whatever you wanna do in there somewhere
Yeah.
and, and build it up like that.
As you said, they haven't actually, you know, it'd be  if you could get some sort of portable
Screening.
screen that'd just shut it off.
Mm.
So people don't feel as though they're sat in a wide ai wide open 
No, I know, yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
you know.
Erm 
Well you ca you ca you can get that.
You can get, you can do something 
But, yeah 
can't you?
Yeah.
Like you say, if you get your satellite T V in there 
Yeah.
you know, you can
Yeah.
just make it a cosy little bar where you can 
Yeah.
That's right.
It won't cost any to give it a go would it?
No.
If Colin's  if Colin's up for it, it wouldn't at all.
I mean, it needs to perhaps  perhaps they can do something for the first couple
Oh yeah, need some sort of er
Yeah.
idea to get it going and get it off the ground even if you  you put your beer on at, well I just thought of couple  Boddingtons put their  they're  they're gonna put their, they're gonna put there's at a pound a pint.
Mm.
You know, just to attract some people, you know, approach the brewery, say look what about a few keg?
And if you get  two or three keg  put that money into free stock you know.
Yeah.
Say you  
Cleaner's not, the cleaner's not done behind here yet.
If you open it up, if you do get it open, and advertise it at Boddingtons a pound a pint, get them straight  to come in.
You're not making a fortune at first, but once you get it going
Mm.
You said about traditional
The only other thing is the .
Depends where your money is really.
 
Whe whe where's your cellar?
Right underneath.
Right at the bottom.
Yeah, but if, if you
How big's your fire exit, entrance?
 
the fire exit  
You could put it behind, you could feed it through the wall behind to where that 
Yeah.
spacious room is where all your chairs are couldn't you?
Yeah.
We probably could, yeah.
Th well, it's no, it's not quite the back.
how would you get in there?
 
Yeah, that's the, that's the thing I was 
Well, it's got, it's a bit dry this.
I know.
It's a bloody, yeah.
You can still .
It's fucking ridiculous!
Erm  cos you'd tell the brewery wouldn't you?
The only other thing to do is, is do what er  er, we did at one time and just get a  bright beer and open it up and  er, and then pull it.
And have it.
 

I know.
Now there's a thought.
It er, you'd have problem with er
But would you?
Depends tha I don't know what sort of draw you can put on that pump here.
They're getting smart.
But I wanna do what the Three Miners do in Lancaster don't they?
That's that er  that's a traditional beer innit?
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
they gotta  but he's knocking it straight 
Yeah.
down aren't they?
It's just getting it up here.
Yeah!
Yeah !
Yeah, very strong lad this.
You might have to do it later.
Can I look at the telly?
Yeah, course you can.
I was gonna 
It's in here.
suggest that.
Up here and then get .
Oh, oh that's my order for Thursday.
Oh right.
Have you got line cleaner?
Yeah?
Mm.
Yeah?
That's put a .
A fair, int it doing?
The bar, the bar, on the bar.
The bar's there, I mean I was thinking you had your stool, painted that white on
Yeah.
or a red  a deep 
Oh yeah.
sort of red behind the bar, maybe get a couple more like that.
Yeah, a lick of paint and, and 
Oh yeah.
and, and that, you know and you can 
And then we'll fill the shelves up.
That's right.
All, all, one thing we haven't discussed is, is these ar these arrears int it, that we've got?
This, the rates 
Yeah.
is the biggest one int it?
Right.
Right.
Now, I don't know if it's worth asking 
Well I could 
council to, if you could like lump it with the next year 's.
El e Elliel, Elliel said that er they could probably  twist the council's arm
What's that for Barry?
 
Well, this, you know we're on about this money
Yes.
well, there is, there is ba bad debts, you know which er
Yeah.
I don't know if I've got them here.
How much is that for?
Well it was er  it was about
Twenty two.
here we are, that's it er  it's rent which we we're gonna clear
Mm.
there's twelve for rates, and the twelve and, other two's ours which we're  we 
Yeah.
can, we can stand on that.
Mm.
You've got, you've got like  water rate, twelve hundred, er, rates, twelve  but er, what we could try to do is approach them and see if we can lump it in with this year and that, obviously have to pay higher
I mean, some of it is  is the next two month anyway  erm 
Yeah.
But we we'd usually have  no 
but 
rents, er we've no er  we've lease to pay back have we or owt like that?
Oh and the other  the other thing is, is, is by asking Fred for
To pay.
That's right.
But even so, then ask Fred on the long term would be ideal.
Er, the biggest thing is for us is  is making payable for you.
Yeah.
I mean 
At first 
we've not gone any further with this Fre with Fred because 
No.
we're just leaving it  so we sort ourselves out first on, on how 
Yes.
we feel happy with it and
Yeah.
and whe how, how, whether you want  Fred involved in, in what way.
Well it's really that's needed be here, you know, if we ca 
Yeah.
if we can 
And 
if we can resolve it  with  cos then you're getting summat on a different style of thinking to that, you know, I know Fred doesn't wanna be involved but then you've always got somebody, well we'll have to go and see Fred first.
Mm.
And, and I don't know.
Yeah, you could work it 
Go see Fred and he's probably got a few more pounds ready available than 
Yeah.
than we have.
Oh yeah.
You know, that's the er 
That's right.
bit difficult.
Yeah.
And that's your er, cos er personally 
Oh, I've got the 
I'll say that it's not.
accounts in various  off-shore  islands and, and
Yeah.
black bin liners in his back garden .
If we can sort him out with rates and, I don't know.
If he can o if we can offset, if we can use all, if he'll  out time type of thing 
Mm.
with that
Yeah.
erm  the oh er
You've gotta put an offer in and pay it so much a month haven't you or something and, and, and get it paid off over a period of time?
And then you can do it without Fred and, really, with Fred is, is at the end of day you could pro proof pay load could go back to yourself and I, I E and ourselves, but by having him that other cut  you're gonna be saying well  it's all a bit more than  your share.
I mean, from my point of view  I don't think he's ever 
I don't think Fred'd be looking for anything as a return.
No.
Not in the shor 
I'd be quite happy to come 
not in the short term.
Not in the short term.
you get tucked into it, and obviously there we'll keep it  sort of low profile.
But giving it a good clean out  and getting 
Mm.
it dus painted behind the things whatever, come on Sunday or whatever  and just say that you might 
In return, yeah.
Just take a
quite keen just to sort of get 
Mm.
mucked into it
Mm.
just to save money
See if you can get
but as long as, I say, the biggest thing from my point er  is  not to so lose money if you can do from where we're going.
No.
And use the fifteen grand to its best  image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club  so it can get people in.
Mm.
And we can get the lighting in.
Because that's what your best thing is
Mm.
you've got the ideas  and th the motions.
Mm.
And for yourself, and what we don't wanna do is like I say, is spend money that  is just gonna disappear and say shit!
We haven't really improved the pub's  barrelage  if goes away.
No.
I mean,th the other aspect of the, of the fif the other aspect of the, the brewery and me that I was  talking about, er I'm thinking about is that we we could do with  you know, okay those,th those figures are  I mean, unless they're really realistic it's gonna be  you know, six months or so
Mm.
before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a  you know 
Yeah.
a profit each week 
Mm.
a a, a, reasonably substantial profit, I mean 
That's right, yeah.
so, with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's  so we need a little of breathing space
Yeah.
on that six months.
Now  er, er obviously if, if we can, if we can get the money off the brewery cos  you know, if we can get a little bit more 
That's right, yes.
than we actually need to spend that  that 
Yeah.
enables us to  you know, have that breathing space  erm  so we can start 
Well what, what we can, you know I say, he's offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can, mind you 
Yeah.
I don't know if we can squeeze any more or what
I reckon
but, but, you know if say well look, you know, we could do with twenty five and he turns round and  he might say well  you know,yo he might say no
Mm.
but we know we've got fifteen just to get us 
Yeah.
going.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What he said then is look, you know  hey he's, all you're saying really 
 
is ah, if your barrelage is there then what we do is buy  five or six barrels from Morecambe Bay Wines.
Yeah.
You can soon get rid of those.
You can say Morecambe Bay Wines and buy  all his
Mm.
cos what I, I just said to him I said look, I says a er sometimes I says it's an awkward time drop for us.
Says well we'll get it delivered here  you know, only without 
Yeah well that's 
invoice.
That's what we wanted innit?
Well what we do, what we use 
 
 
What we do is buy it barrelled and and 
Yeah.
get out be 
Yeah.
Morecambe Bay License form.
Barrel or keg.
Because we ca we can live on thirty pound on barrel  can't we?
I think we can do.
I'd like you to  just purely myself, I'm not saying I'm  right and you're not right and people like 
Mm.
my o my own personal view is if we just  pay the fifteen and it's sort of off in there straight away and then spend  but not to sort of say, well you can spend it and update it can't you?
But spend what we feel is gonna make the club
Mm.
better image like you say
Mm.
somebody comes to look at it just for a view  I mean, I say, I, I'm quite happy coming like I said th if you motion behind there, make the bar presentable  we'll fill it out with stock  then that'll look better
Yeah.
but if we do display 
Put more stock in.
we've got a load 
Yeah.
of tent cards and display things 
Yeah.
that could decorate that.
Yeah.
You know, and we'll do it ourselves, I say  I mean, what you want Barry is like wanna keep it  low profile.
Mm.
But we've both got time to sort, I say, somebody, we'd enjoy doing it.
Because we, we, we either do it ourselves and spend 
Before the cricket season.
Yeah.
Yeah.
 
I mean, America are getting a private cup for here.
I mean, if you just emulsion 
Yeah.
that, the red bits, into red  and got the, so I say, nice sort of tent cards and  and got a few firms, I mean firms and come on in and do your display you know
Yeah.
and your promotions and 
Yeah.
That's something we will, we will be able to do is, you know, is 
Yeah.
I mean things like what I want on desperately quickly is Rebel Yell cos they're  spending a fortune in the rock, well all our punters all know it.
I mean you go down in London it's the  it's just like Rebel Yell everywhere, but it's all heavy rock  so 
Yeah.
I mean it's just perfect for that, but  I know they do a display unit and things like 
Yeah.
that.
But I mean, I have to go 
Well that's all it wants.
through, I have to go through Michelin to get that.
Yeah well we'll, you won't know, you'll be .
 
You might do.
No, no, I'll be 
We 
That's what, I mean according to Tracey on
You could of told me Tracey's on.
Yeah, that bitch!
Didn't mention .
He said   .
It was er  one bottle free, buy two and get a bottle free and, plus display unit you see
Yeah.
and I said well I want it on but he said you'll have to go for this.
Oh course.
Said alright, so I  filled out a bloody form and I went to Michelins, they knew nothing about it and they hadn't  got it displayed either !
Yeah.
And this was like  three weeks later, it wasn't
Mm.
you know  cos I said 
Oh yeah.
I wanted to begin with that week.
But that mean, I mean that's 
Yeah.
examples handfuls of it, you know.
Oh yes, you could pay for that .
I think we should be able to get some proper er  box coolers in here off the
Mhm mm.
you know these, these er  lift down ones you know 
Mm mm.
you can put all your cans in and
Mm.
get, you know, get them in and say and say look  yo well you're gonna save money on the pints  well  give us four box coolers for a year and  you 
Mm.
know which style I mean?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah I know.
The big ones.
Do all wine coolers 
Yeah.
as well don't 
Yeah.
they?
Don't do a lot of wine  you know 
No but if you, only for your functions and 
Yeah.
Well true.
That's kind of true, yeah.
I mean, we went through  we went through nearly a case  of  one point fives at Mary's party.
Leibfraumilch.
I mean, it, we had 
I mean I reckon
we had to
or do you want to 
Yeah.
how do you functions 
Nine, eight  er nine  er one point fives.
Your shoe's just  fallen off Barry !
Yeah I know .
I didn't think he was get there !
Er 
Get a few Pils' cabinets
You could ge 
off them.
It's, it's great!
Yeah I know.
The staff can't wander off you see  on a night.
Can't sneak off at back cos they 
Oh yeah.
move!
I know.
They're stood here like this !
They could do your function thing.
Have your function here and get a bottle of champagne free kind of thing, or whatever your, with your parties.
Something, I mean, we can  work that in the price or whatever 
Yeah.
you know.
I mean, other thing we really need to all, er you see, when I was working at it, and when we were doing it all the time 
Yeah.
er you were using your own contacts 
Well that's right.
like 
Yeah.
Yeah.
you know  mate of mine had  got his son at bloody  public and wants one of these posh public school type  all night parties, so we had one of those, and, you know  and er
I say, like I say I just  just red er paint summat like, these are white these and just go down on the red  and just up there and just up here, just get your displays
Yeah.
and your bar'll look ten times better.
Yeah.
I tell, I mean  ju okay, forgetting the carpet at the moment  it's, it'll cost, it'll cost about a grand to get the toilets all done up
Yeah.
three hundred quid for  satellite in  erm  I need these shutters repairing  cos they're 
Yeah.
knackered!
And, and odds 
You need it all.
and sods and I, I, I'd like to buy a couple of lighting effects, but I mean 
Yeah.
you're only talking about a co you know, a few hundred quid for that.
Let's just choose, I know you can't change 
There is 
what the there
But as I say 
No you can't 
you know,
Yeah.
get, get a 
just er 
cooler
the basis of this fifteen grand, is using the fifteen grand but like  we can see you using that 
I'd like to look at shuttering that area if we are gonna do your
Yeah.
Yeah.
I will, well 
But we can't 
I, I, I reckon 
it 
that could pay for itself if Colin got in so you'll do that one get Colin to pay for it.
Colin's awa I think he's, he's taking kids away for camping and things all next week but I'll, I'll try 
You need 
I can say to him that about it.
yo for a start you need those two,th these end two you need bli you need blinds on  because you can't utilize the screen  in the summer without these  I mean we got, we got blinds for all those windows, I mean 
Mm.
they're all, all they are are  they're pho photographic  you know, when you have blackouts and er, you know the
Yeah.
they're that kind of mat 
Yeah I know what you mean.
white material, they're just white, but they, they  a total black out  which they use on the rave nights.
I mean, I do I, think the view is quite nice  certainly if you got a summer it's
Oh well, yeah.
quite a pleasant evening.
See, my idea originally was that  cos it comes back from when I used to go in the  in the Blue Anchor in Lancaster after work  I mean we had everybody in there!
We had like market traders in there  managers of Marks and Spencers and Woolies 
Yeah.
and, you know, building societies, insurance companies, and everybody's  i the rounds were like twenty five quid a time, but everybody's only drinking halves cos you could never 
That's right.
you know, so just half a gui but  it, it got that, but once they changed the opening hours  do you remember when they brought in six 
Yeah.
o'clock?
Yeah.
It destroyed all that.
Yeah.
And then er, they brought it back and then they started doing  to quarter to six, but it still wasn't good enough cos  you can't, you can't have all these people in suits and briefcases stood outside a pub for quarter of an hour waiting  for it open , you know 
No.
I mean it  wasn't good 
That's right.
for their image.
No, no.
So 
Suit off.
Oh no they're your 
So it like killed that.
But I'm sure there's, I'm sure there's that kind of trade for, you know, a sort of  a Bic Biro runner type, you know, that kind of  well our age group, you know
Yeah.
the sort of
Well that's it, yeah.
thirty to, thirty to 
Yeah.
fifty age group.
That's right.
And, and people want a drink after work and have a chat, cos the 
Yeah.
it was a it was all business people and you're talking about 
That's right.
you know  what it was like, what things were and 
Once you can get people in  you know, you gotta attract them in, but once you get them in they'll 
Yeah.
be,ev oh it's alright
Yeah.
I quite like it.
Got them into this place.
Make it pleasant, you know, and have to do summat  you know, just to make it  have to get nice  mirrors up on wall and
I mean the wine bar 
you know 
in Lancaster did that happy hour didn't they?
And that got 
That's right.
heaving 
Yeah.
with business people.
That's what you wanna do.
Like I say, you know put, put your Boddys on at a 
I bet that would be really interesting.
pound a pint between 
Yeah.
five and seven.
Elliel's our discount because you know they're doing 
No.
It was great!
Mm.
I mean the biggest thing really I think  my  interest in all this to get secure trade from us
Mm.
which we're gonna get   and get your salary.
You know, because they're the few main things round here, you're happy, and you can feel that obviously you, you'll be working for something.
Yeah.
I mean, to be honest I've put in  like two, two years without any 
Oh I know.
Yeah I know.
salary with this place.
I mean I've been doing outside jobs to get, you know, I mean, like doing festivals 
 
and whatever else to get 
Yeah.
my money in.
So the 
Has an anybody come to you through the  
and, you're losing money,, if you're not, if you're not seeing any return you're
No.
you're going through the motions
No.
I mean, God, you know  if I've gotta go down to London for three days I'd rather do that cos it's gonna earn me two or three grand.
Well we could set, like you say and no you know, and get it going and you make a salary 
 
and, and then if there's anything left e er, between us, and then that's all well 
Yeah.
and good.
Yeah.
We're, we're not wanting a wage out of it or anything, you know
We'll get it to the
Well you'll get it, you'll get it from the turnover won't you?
We we're, we're quite, we're quite pleased, you know, say well  let's see if we can get it going and, and make a success out of it.
And also, I mean, if we turn over hundred thousand pound with you in a year you're gonna make some money out of that.
That's right.
Yeah.
You know, so it's 
Yeah.
er
Make a grand or summat out of that won't you?
That's it, yeah.
If we're lucky.
If you're lucky .
 
 
The only th the only thing is, is th is what we'll do the beer, whether we're gonna have to connect it to the brewery or whether we can  get it through ourselves, I don't know.
I would think you're probably gonna have, committed to  separate accounts.
Yeah, I'm not too bothered about that.
But as I said 
But if it's, if it can be dropped at your place
Well that's it, yeah.
Because I mean er  you can always say look, I've got commitments all over the place and actually be 
Well I've tol I, I sold them that
Yeah.
I says, I says he's go he can't lose his .
Yeah.
with you, you've gotta get the rest of the stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
As long as 
See 
we can
Well that 
it doesn't, it doesn't matter what barrelage you put through it  but put, as long as we know that er, the fifteen thou it's gonna be written off at thirty pound a barrel, so the sooner you, you do it, the sooner it's written off.
Yeah.
But also 
Good.
it also means we haven't got any, that's an area where we haven't got any repayments.
I'll just have a look round there again Barry.
Yeah okay.
Do you wanna
Can I see the back?
play with those figures again?
Dunno.
Before we get started doing it.
Well yeah, doing the cellar.
Do you wanna have a look in the cellar now?
Oh yeah.
Okay.
gonna have a look round the back is he?
Yeah.
I'm just, I mean  I reckon you could, I dunno if you can just pull them in.
Draw them up  and we used to do  the  would be quicker .
Oh ta.
you're gonna be really talking about next week aren't you?
It looks like it.
Yeah if you can.
Definitely.
See  not that easy.
No.
I'm just thinking of that exit there.
This, this is good.
I mean if you put that 
 
the nearest one 
You mean, it's a fire exit so that's the problem so you're not gonna be able to leave anything in it  that would obstruct.
But  ah, so this, it's the actual fire exit for here int 
Mm.
it?
Yeah.
Mm.
That leads downstairs don't it?
Yeah.
It goes out next to the cellar.
I suppose like you say at nine thirty once the music starts no one 's gonna want to 
Oh er, if you put, if you put  if you put wrought iron gates  gates decorated type of thing round there
Yeah.
and then  somebody stands there, two fifty  that's what I were thinking, an admission from here.
Mm.
And, and wrought iron it, yeah, you know.
Well wrought iron'd look  it'd look quite good for the functions trade as well cos you can get 
Yeah.
the artificial plants up it 
Mm.
and whatever else 
Yeah.
when you do 
Get  climbing plants 
Yeah.
You can get it, it will soon cover 
Yeah.
cover it actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean close that area down.
And that, that would do double job cos that would do the job of your blinds as well wouldn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then they'll cause the atmosphere rather than 
Mm.
big open wide 
Mm.
club.
Yeah.
Mm.
Get your wrought, your gates there, or something like that to be 
Yeah.
round the back, which entrance would they come in?
They wouldn't come in that end.
Well all you do right, you have gates 
Well I mean 
then they're open  so that at half nine  you close them there, or at ten o'clock you close them there  and you say when they come through  if you're going out that 
Yeah.
way  or whatever.
Yeah.
I mean I  I think you just have to  but
It's something that you've gotta be 
You'd have to play it by ear I think.
Yes 
thinking ahead.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, you're thinking well 
Let's 
at first you could just wrought iron it round and, and just give it that 
As you say, if somebody's been in there from bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven 
Well that's it.
or twelve, then fine, let them.
I mean I  th I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind that
No.
you know, I mean
So you could either come in half eight, half nine or  
That's right.
You know 
But really, you know 
Yeah.
what you do?
At half nine you put someone on the door here to take money, anyone who comes in, whether they come into here or go into there
Mm.
anyone who's been drinking all afternoon  if you want to er, wander across  
Yeah, I mean, what you, what you'd have to be careful of is, is sooner or later people'll catch on  to 
Yeah.
coming in at quarter past nine 
Yeah.
Yeah.
buying one extra drink and erm  getting a  you know  cheaper than saving theirselves two and a half quid then.
pint they buy, and if they buy five pints
Yeah !
they can have a three, er er  a three pound voucher.
Can you imagine Polly organizing that all!
 
 
We're getting complicated aren't we?
Why can't we do it, to me, cost effective.
 
Torture.
Complicating issues.
I remember  at the Uni when we used to give  we used to put stamps on people, you know,
Yeah.
for pass outs and that or anything 
So does Broadway.
and er  I bloody, I said, I said in the end I've, what we ought to do is  lop some part of their anatomy off, like a little digit or something then we can prove they've been in
eventually, after about two years when you get this sort of  armless, legless cor 
Oh oh!
body  oh he's a good customer!
We'll let him in for free!
He gets a free, free ticket !
Well it's like, like a  all you want to do is 
That's what you get,you just gotta stand or you went downstairs to another bar
Yeah,th the trouble is you're 
and got a stamp 
you 
and they would
you, you're doing it in the same  room 
Yeah.
aren't you?
That's the .
That is as well.
But I  I dunno, I  see it's not  once you're u actually up here, looking  I think it's different when you're up here looking back as when you're over there looking up here.
Yeah.
It's not quite as cold and empty as 
If it got going you'd probably use mo another, another half of area, you know 
Yeah, yeah, you want 
you don't wanna close it off.
But, like you say maybe just  just a bit of wrought 
Yeah.
ironwork
Yeah.
I think so.
to just 
I think you do I think that would look good anyway  and 
Yeah.
and it would also enable you to  quickly and easily do something on the erm  on the, on the private functions night to make it look  different.
Mm.
I mean, I wouldn't suggest putting 
 
plants up and everything  for our normal  you know, rock nights, I mean we just  have the wrought iron up and whatever, but
I mean, with them sort of then 
Yeah.
once you got erm tied into these you can 
Oh yeah.
do whatever to the thing.
Yeah.
But it would give you affect.
That's right.
I mean, those are just  we just went out and chucked a few fucking trees down.
They're not real then Barry?
No, the trees are  the er  things tied on to them aren't.
Oh.
But er
Yeah.
I think, it's quite actually, it needs a bit of character.
I mean, that'll cover 
Yeah.
if you did that in quite a few places 
Yeah.
throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes 
Ye 
and your, your .
I mean, what we initially wanted to do with all this was cover this whole area in, in greenery and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type.
Mm.
I mean, again, it's ideas when you're sat 
It's ideas.
planning, before you've actually moved in and get 
It is.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
and get  and then, then you start
that's, that's the other thing when there's only two of you involved  and you, we were opening for that first sort of eighteen months  five, six days a week  just keeping on top of a day to day business doesn't allow you to sit back
No, I know that.
and expand it, and whereas, you know, that, that's one area that'd be great with having yo your involvement
Yeah.
that you go in and say well  you know
It sounds like this sort of thing 
Yeah.
When did you paint all this green?
It was when I was working for Walt Disney, so it'll be  two years ago.
Two years 
Yeah.
ago.
I was over in Belfast and I came back and it were green.
It was alri it's, it's actually lasted reasonably well considering it hadn't been 
Yeah.
for two years.
Yeah.
But again, it was all done, it was all literally done in a weekend.
Yeah.
It was like a  virtually an all night blitz job and  so bits of it, you know, it wasn't like, totally completed, you know, you've got  and as Scouse was doing some of it it was er   the paintwork leaves something to be desired in  areas .
Something there Barry  little bit in there look.
Just coming down a little bit.
They just need brushing back up.
It's got a few  you've got the 
Not a problem.
roof repaired haven't you?
This 
Yeah.
The heating's very efficient as well.
It's very hot gas heating.
Yes.
Erm
They did do it, like you say it was more or less just covering for itself now  and then use 
Mm.
you build up, up and up don't you?
Yeah.
So
Yes.
Let us have a look at cellar and then we'll, d'ya wanna, and then we'll,
Yeah.
then we can say we've to looked at everything and then we know where  you know 
Yeah.
Okay.
and then we can er  we can start, you know, we can, at least we can say look, we've got fifteen grand coming in and th it .
Yeah.
But we need a full .
Yeah.
I mean, we can, we can start by  we I mean we can get people set up  for doing things from the first of March can't we?
Yeah.
The little bits and pieces that we talked about.
Well we, well we, we can start if you wanna start with the 
Or we can think about doing something about 
Yes.
this.
We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wanna start giving it a lick of paint.
You see, now the more you think about it, I mean the more you  you don't actually use this
No.
very much.
I mean, you look at it, if everybody was seated in this area that could be seated  I mean, you're only talking about bloody 
I 
thirty people.
I don't think it's too bad actually.
I don't think the carpet's too bad at all really.
Well th there's areas, I mean 
Yeah.
tha the licens 
Oh yeah.
the licensing people would pull us up on that 
Yeah.
if they came.
But maybe, if you could cut it off from there.
That's what I mean, you gotta  and then do it, clear it, and then clear all that
Mm.
and just left that area 
Clear all that 
and they're obviously, they're gonna say
Come right up to the  right up to bar really aren't you?
Yeah.
I mean th th er, the other thing psychologically is it's, you know
Blue Rhapsody.
Blue Rhapsody.
If you wanted to cha if you want to change it slightly you've got  a problem.
You know  I think it, I think it's something that you can say well  you know, that'd be one of our objectives 
Mm.
once we get it going, but le 
Mm.
alright,we we've got 
Yeah.
a few bob in the kitty
Right.
let's, or we can go to brewery for another five grand, we'll do the carpet 
Mm.
now.
I reckon the first thing really is, is get your salary.
Mm.
Get your salary, that you feel that I'm doing this and I'm getting it right.
Mm.
Is that the right  sort of, if our  I mean from our objective is to get more sales 
Yeah.
right now.
That's right.
That's right.
And we've gotta 
That's right.
manipulate people to say well, how do we get them drink more?
And you say like five pound a head when they  they come in
How bad's the seating though?
Sit there till 
Is it, is it that bad?
It's, it's, if, it needs doing
Oh it needs doing does it?
You know.
If you've got a guy gathered, I'm not saying try but if you got somebody who, who did the job and gathered it in  like they would do.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it i 
An upholster.
It's a perpetual patching up job at the moment 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because, because it is only patched up, it's 
Yeah.
it  create more problems o you know  cos people stand on it and 
Get an upholsterer just to come and  tidy it up 
Yeah.
and fill in where there's been 
Yeah.
some damage done.
Yeah, that's right.
I mean there's 
Just, just  tart it up really.
There's a bit of structural damage to the support 
Yeah.
and things like that, that  start the seating going and things.
Right.
Okay.
Oh this  this  actual stuff anyway we'll go, we're putting that with that is alright to that
Oh yes.
the back's have been 
Yeah.
alright.
Oh yeah.
There's a few of them damaged but, but erm  I think we've repaired most of them.
You see, we did get it all completely repaired when we moved in, cos it was in a hell of a state from Peter !
Cos Peter  had this place.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well we, we, we know 
We knew 
about that.
about that.
How?
Did he 
Cos we 
owe you money?
we gone 
Well 
and got it actually.
Did you!
Bloody right!
God!
You must be one of the few people
It were quite good cos what we had, we had th the  the other partner  who was, you know, the other partner is Michael.
He was called, what was he called?
Ken ?
No, no.
No.
No, that's
Yes.
that's John .
But what do you call him?
That erm
I know who you mean, I met him, yeah.
Cos the other guy was a, was a bar manager  Duncan or
Mm.
Der summat like that, and his wife had a baby at the same time as Elaine's so she  our midwife would come and er, so the  she kept in touch really of  of what they were   because they wanted to, I'll take the place off , they wanted to take it over.
I don't think they was er  as bad a
No.
shower of shit 
No.
as he were 
No.
tended to 
No.
be.
But er, in the end they never got the license back.
Because what they did try and do is buy the catholic club didn't they?
Top of Lancasters.
Next to the 
Cos the 
Alex.
The Alex.
They tried to get behind there, the catholic 
Yeah.
club.
Right.
Then they got, they didn't get it past.
Mm.
But er  he actually owed 
Yeah, that used to be
about five grand at one stage and got it down to three and half, and then he got to six hundred and eighty  and they went to court 
 
and then they got  
He paid it.
Paid it  through the court.
Well that was  remarkably
Lucky.
lucky.
Yeah I know.
He didn't half go for a lot again.
Yes we did seem to be quite lucky to keep   .
Yeah.
But I, I, I'm amazed that breweries keep lending him money!
I know.
I mean, it's unbelievable, you know th er, he's done so many breweries and yet why they don't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another.
Because you get people like Ben  who's giving his money he doesn't really give a toss!
He don't give a toss.
Mm.
As long as he's got an installation going in and if it
Yeah.
if it gets written off or
Gets bigger.
or someone has to take a, a bi a co company has to take a big lot off.
 
It's par for the course really.
Mm.
Well, you know.
Dreadful innit?
 
Well he's got that much money to burn Barry that's what it is.
Mm.
You've gotta burn to, to cover all  they've just laid three hundred and thirty management staff off  management, not dray lads, not  brewery lads.
Yeah.
Three hundred and thirty managers  where 
I think it's your, that's your T V thing is it?
Yeah.
T V, video projection.
How do you work that thing?
How do you work that thing?
From behind there.
And where's it come there?
That one.
That just puts on
At the moment we use
Rock videos.
Yeah.
I mean, Mark's got some  great stuff of the sixties er er  er, ex, ex movies of the so er trailers of ex movies, you know
Yeah.
sizzling, sexual and all these sort of and,wha what was really outrageous in the sixties looks so tame, but 
Yeah.
it's on in black and white and fifties, it looks quite good fun.
Well that  on a Thursday 
It's 
night could be a sixties night then.
I mean when we get, when
A fifties night even, you know.
when you get tho when you get the half the er  when you get sort of well like the  scooterist dos and th the DJs bring it up, I mean they bring in a hard core
You'll have to try and change the old fash 
and things.
And  and  and quite amazing 
 
watching Jean
Yes.

So I said, oh!
Well, come and speak to him.
But, so  I went, and he said oh!
Barry's dad's been on the phone he wants to you to urgently book a bus  so he co 
Will you see if that says, that sort, yeah it is.
I'll put that on.
I think it is, isn't it?
Yeah.
But he does
Yeah, you just bend them over.
That's it.
It's, they're not as easy to bend as you think.
Got a screwdriver round here.
Do you want me to  hold them up for you?
And this blasted , then we'll get  start.
You know what Colin does and whatnot.
Right.
You want me to see if I can find Mick don't you?

Harvey.
Yeah.
I hadn't thought of that.
Lives near the factory somewhere.
Might be in on Friday.
Doubt it.
Why?
It's Saturday it was  it's not bloody arrangement.
Oh no!
I meant  I meant  he lives somewhere near the factory.
I think Scouse knows where he lives.
Cos sometimes you see him a lot, and then he has a spell of not coming in don't 
Yeah.
he?
That's right.
Mm.
They keep sending, they keep changing my passport!
Well they do, don't they?
Well I'll have changed one next week.
What's wrong with that brush?
It's broken.
It's broken.
Mm.
What i what's other end?
Has other end already been used?
Looks like, looks like sawing off and redoing 
Ah!
it.
Need to get a new brush.
I think that's a point .
Just get a  a new stick for the
That's enough.
Just go in bin.
I just want to make this phone call for   when we  lock the door and  .
Mm.
I'm going into Lancaster Saturday.
Erm  no, but I can leave a message can't I?
To say, you know  they er   when Barbara must, has got to go back in hospital .
That little  Lancaster .
Mm.
Erm, you know she had this  cancer seven years ago  when she had her breast cancer and, had her breast taken off  they've now found it's gone further in  seven years  she, you know, she was
forgotten all about it, anyway  she found a little dent  apparently our Laura said that's just as bad as finding lumps.
She just went and said I've got this  you know, check up, cos she knew she was going to Christies for her final check up  and, they've whizzed her in.
Got to  do another operation and remove all the glands from under her arm.
So  it's not as though they're gonna get anyone to come .
No.
I mean I  I obviously hadn't said that to her.
Oh no!
Obviously.
But er  she said she'd been feeling a bit rough recently.
But she never suspecting it was, you know, when they'd been alright for seven years you
you think you're alright don't you?
So she's, going in  today.
Erm  so I'm gonna go in this afternoon to see her.
See if they've taken any  .
And I hope .
I hope she does.
Mm.
You know,.
Yeah.
Anything in it?
Have you seen it?
Yes.
Well they would .
Oh!
A bit 
You know like you being all pathetic.
No.
Well, a bit I intend carrying on as the  parliamentary candidate  and somebody had obviously asked Dave  why it is something has nothing whatsoever to do with the constituency.
That was last time's agent.
And he said, oh well it's probably being discussed at the next meeting.
Well he's under a lot  or else he won't.
Still  he won't come if he thinks there's any  messing about.
I mean,i it would be  zilch for the Labour Party to try and swap candidates now.
You know  it would be just stupid wouldn't it?
Yeah.
Mm.
What would they achieve?
Well  that's right.
I mean I don't know Dave  's just not  That's stupid!
Why make any comment whatsoever?
Yeah.
Why not just keep quiet?
So, you know  cos it just says all candidates receiving .
I mean Labour can't win either way.
They've got to hope that it'll be resolved before then.
If they put another candidate in  it's  doesn't do Labour's name any good does it?
Mm.
Well it's a
It's a waste
enough of these ad pamphlets.
Guilt?
Well it's, it's been looking as though you're  you're guilty 
 
before  there's problem a admitted.
I mean as we're not looking to win anyway, I don't know what the hell they're bothered about.
I mean it's not exactly, you know, the world's safest Labour seat is it?
No.
What was this big presentation yesterday?
The  tourist notices   buffets.
Mm?
Well what it is 
Thrown out of their offices.

Yeah, yeah.
No that's alright.
It's when the middle ones are gone 
 
tha that's a problem 
Yeah.
innit?

If, if this happens now you, you won't get  bookings for a national conference in there.
Mm.
It's actually in  it's, it's actually a special leaflet produced by Blackpool, nineteen ninety two re register of conference accommodation.
And these are the prices quoted  for  erm  no, it doesn't say from  no  nope  it just says what the prices would be.
But apparently this happened last year at this particular conference.
Yes.
Well, I haven't got a fax here but I  I can  send you one because  I certainly know my delegates wouldn't want to book at er  mm.
Yeah, no  well we, we can let you have a copy erm  but erm, you know, I, I can't  make these reservations at  at normal prices, my delegates won't accept that.
So, tell, tell me what you're saying it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's not what's been quoted you see.
It's, erm  th th the whole, the two conferences for the year, local government and national conference  are  are on this same register.
Yes.
Yes, it's the  i I mean, I, I happen to be a delegate to national conference as well, so I ha I actually have two of these brochures.
I've got  the brochure for local government conference, which is this weekend  and I've got the brochure for national conference.
 
So I actually have the same brochure twice.
But erm  I know my delegates won't, won't want to book at that  er it's, they, they will expect to book at  prices quoted in the  in the conference register.
Okay.
We will.
Thanks.
Bye .
Certainly won't want to book at that Barry!
Well haven't you got a problem if there's no hotels available?
I have got a massive problem.
Well you can always commute.
Well, that's what we do because  they won't put up with that.
Have to try
Is there no hotels  I mean, just along that Preston Road?
Well, that's what I'll have to look for now.
I'm in difficulties now.
And these are quoting er
Mind you, you're not gonna get a delegate rate from them are you?
Eh?
You're no the further we, you go away, the further you go away from Blackpool but it's not at 
Oh yeah.
But I think 
delegate's rate.

But Francis told me that had happened to them last year.
Boo bookings please.
If it's still possible to book erm, two doubles and a twin for this weekend or are you booked up ?
Are they delegates all the time   conference?

It's Jean here.
I  yes, I've just had my massive little row with The Savoy  about the prices and they just wanted to charge us the normal price!
So I've said they can get stood on.
And I booked at the Claremont  which is, twenty eight pounds.
Well, I'm not being prepared to be held to ransom by them.
And I'm, I'm faxing  erm  I'm sorry, I'm not gonna fax it, I'm just going to send a letter to national office  about The Savoy in First Leisure.
Because they can't do this to delegates!
Cos they did it with you last year didn't they?
Mm.
Yeah.

Well, I think we should tell national office that this is, you know, this is happening and it's not on!
I've got  I'll tell you what I've got, I've got for nineteen ninety two  confere Register of Conference Accommodation, from national office  whe where they tell you to book!
You know, cos I'd got it at a P P C as well, for national conference.

Now  I, I've rung the Claremont and they've said, oh yes, it's the conference erm  you know  amount  and we're very,appar we were, I was very lucky cos we got the last three rooms.
And she said, we're absolutely booked up!
But, you see Bob told me about it, he said, well he, you know  booked at the Claremont because he'd had problems getting prices out of the others.
But, our union always stay at the Claremont and we've always found it, you know, okay.
But I'm, I'm not paying sixty five quid a night!
It's just stupid Francis!

You can't lose it Francis, cos it's one of the major hotels.
Yeah.
They've got, they've got lots of bars, there's a bar in the basement and there's bars upstairs, and a dance floor and a swimming pool and  I'm sure it will Francis.
I mean  yeah, well I don't blame him.
But it says  number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet, or shower and toilet.
There are very few hotels of this standard that don't have showers and toilets.
So  it's twenty eight Francis, which is, I think is  yes.
Yes.
Well, it doesn't matter where we go to eat does it?
And we, can go and eat wherever we want.
Oh!
But  th you can have bed and breakfast and evening meal if you want.
Erm, but generally,ye I mean cos Eileen and I go to a   we nearly always go somewhere like Carriages or  you know, somewhere Italian  which is, you know, it might, it all depends on what Jim's eating at the time.
But, but  you can't go wrong, there's plenty to eat in Blackpool can you?
In fact, I'm trying to think of a place that erm  we once went when we  at regional conference, it was behind the Claremont somewhere.
It was a  it was a  little Italian restaurant with about forty six  and we went at regional conference and it was astounding!
It was a really brilliant chef!
I'll try and get Bob to find the  the number of it.
Cos that was really  a really nice place.
But, you wouldn't have expected to find it where you found it.
No.
You know the road behind the promenade?
It was on that road.
And we only found it by chance, you know how you go off to  think oh I'll, I'll go and find a coffee or something, and we found this restaurant at lunch time and had a coffee there  and we looked at the menu and, you know, we, we couldn't believe it!
Yeah.
Well I'll try, I'll try and get Bob to remember the name of it.
Alright.
And so I'll see you when we get there Francis.
I said we'll a probably arrive early afternoon.
So  no  doesn't  well you know what he'll be like, he'll be messing about all day.
But I know Kinnock's speaking at four isn't he?
So we  I want to  Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh well he'll have to be then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's alright.
Don't worry.
I'll, I'll look after .
Because there's erm  there's  Geoff and Louise are staying with us, and Eileen and I are staying.
You and Jim are staying.
And I know that Bob and Sue have booked at the Claremont so there'll be quite a few of us there.
So, I'll, I'll keep an eye on us.
And I'll go and have a look at your room.
Just to make sure everything's alright  before he gets there.
Right.
Thanks Francis.
See you Friday.
Bye .
I should have checked that shouldn't I?
Well   is a  en suite.
Yeah.
I don't think it is gonna be en suite.
Yeah.
Well they said, the number of rooms  didn't it?
Didn't say all rooms.
And if you've got the last three I can't believe that the last three are en suite.
I only need one en suite.
 
That's what I thought !
It'll be two rooms and a bath or a shower.
Shall I ring back?
I stayed at the Claremont when I was down doing  and I can't remember where it is on the street .
Well, I  we were when I went
John was.
John  but mind you, John has been insistent on it, he 
Mm.
moved a whole delegation if it weren't en suite.
Yeah.
Well Bob will do me a swap if  it's gonna come to a crisis.
I think I'll ring Madge up.
Cos it will cause a crisis 
Oh yeah.
with Jim.
Of course.
I mean  he's at the age of being incontinent int he?
Call me regional .
Is he introducing a conference now?
John unwashed and unshaved on the front delegate, on the front.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd er  ring up just in case cos you might have to solve your problem.
Better to knowing now than to know when you arrive there.
Have they mended your photocopier yet?
No.
They won't be  if you want to photocopy something.
I might do.
But we'll give them a ring now anyway.
I need to get hold of Mayfair as well cos there's cigarettes out  so
Hello, it's Mrs  here, I've just spoken to the other lady  making a booking for  three twin rooms.
Can you just check whether they're en suite.
They are?
Oh brilliant!
You've saved my life!
Else my chairman was er, just gonna give .
Oh!
That's great!
No problem.
Thanks.
Bye .
Phew!
Yeah.
Better telephone  so that she can be sure that  when he asks the dreaded question that they are.
Must remember I've got to talk to him about here.
The answer is yes, they all are.
Ah!
Francis I had a little panic then, and I decided to ring  them back .
But, no  yeah  yeah  well, I thought, I thought I'd better  be safe, yeah.
I don't want a weekend with Jim where I, I'm in trouble  all weekend !
Oh don't Francis!
I mean er, I'd, I'd never have lived it down.
Yeah.
Well that's what he'd say to me, why didn't find out first?
So, anyway, you're reduced from,so it's en suite.
Yeah.
She said  exactly Francis!
Well we'll spend it on food and drink Francis.
But erm  er, I feel a lot more comfortable cos I think sixty five pounds a night's outrageous!
For just spending  well, for us, when we're just, you're only there for  your breakfast aren't you?
You never go back again.
So  because we'll be able to have lunch at British Home Stores.
We'll not be able to break with tradition .
Geoff will insist that we go to British Home Stores for, well we'll, if, if we we're with Geoff and Louise, that's where we generally go to lunch, and  it's really nice!
It's a lovely  self-service  in Blackpool .
But    you know the Labour Party is worse than the Conservatives for traditions aren't they?
Mm.
Anyway, look  I'll find out from Bob about this restaurant and  see if there's a possibility that it might be worth booking before I go.
But I know that Jim's going to have to .
And I  I don't want to spend all night chasing round Blackpool looking for  for a place that serves ordinary food of a decent  standard.
Right Francis.
I'll leave on that note.
Bye .
Yeah, she does want to go.
They don't want him trailing down th 
well we're in a  next week.
It would be  a couple of days.
I think it's .
I want Mayfair as well.
I want Mayfair to come.
Filling the machine?
Fill it up.
It's empty, so  Mayfair fills it up.
You don't know where he is do you?
Oh!
Right.
Okay.
I'll try County Hall.
Right.
Thanks.
Bye .
What's it called  Mains?
Mains Business Services.
It's here   I think, but I'm not sure.
Mains, Mains, Mains, Mains.
Oh!
They have been getting Ma Macs first don't they?
For some unknown reason!.
Well can I have the Labour group then please?
You tell me why they has  Mac before  Mains.
Mm.
Right .
L M, Main.
H, I, J, K  .
Close.
Sor if I sorted out being able to book at this restaurant which only is about    I'd be in 
How many nights are you there, two?
Two.
Be in  if, everybody's good books.
Cos it really, it's really nice!
We just found it by chance.
You can't, can't 
It 
remember what it's called?
I know!
I just can't.
Bob'll know.
Well you probably, I mean you, you as, you as well, so  I mean, you probably won't 
No he's 
be able to get there till this evening and you probably won't be able to see him will you?
No.
Well a as long as he knows I'm looking for him.
They erm  wa when we to we, we were staying at the Claremont  and  I don't, oh, I think we just decided we'd find a cup of coffee.
It was M S F thing, we were with Margaret  about the  M S F.
And  said, oh, let's go and find a cup of coffee  but, have a bit of a walk and walk down to conference but we'll not walk down the prom
Mm.
we'll walk down the road at the back  and we'd only just turned round the corner from the Claremont and we found this restaurant  and it was, it was an absolutely brilliant chef, really nice restaurant, really high quality  and it was  was  quite reasonable price, it wasn't cheap.
Mm.
So, when we found this we thought ooh, this is alright!
You know, we'll  so we've been quite a few times since, but I cannot think of the name of it.
You see, Jim doesn't like, I mean, we'd go to Carriages probably  cos it's a  a proper Italian
Yeah.
that absolutely reeks with garlic and  all the rest of it.
Well  that means Jim will pull a face!
Or he'll start going 
Oh, this big international financier!
Oh!
No!
Not, I mean, is the, when it comes down to food  wi he's a traditionalist.
So we've always got to find somewhere to eat that's 
You're gonna be pushed getting, you know, roast beef and Yorkshire in Brussels aren't you?
God knows!
Steak and kidney pie!
You're joking!
Cos everybody sort of, just try to think, think of in Brussels.
Why they go, they go to er  a six course sort of have as much main course as you like.
It's a  a  a re a really nice restaurant  but you can pick all your food raw  and they just, there's a chef cooking, and you just get one of these plates, you can have as many helpings as you want, they serve you a cold starter and a hot starter  but there's  a buffet that's about  half the size of our club  and one side of it it's all  fish on a wet fish slab, and steak, and veal, and chicken and  so there's every sort of meat you can think of, and you can pick a wooden platter full of it, so you go and give it the chef with this number that they give you  and then they come serve you with whatever you want.
And you can have as many helpings of whatever you want.
And the salad stuff  and fresh fruit and all that sort of thing, takes  about the full length of our bar up  you know, you, you couldn't think of a salad that isn't there.
But you can't, and there's, then there's loads of hot veg.
Mm.
There's no vegetables you can't mention.
I think it's about twenty quid a head, but you can actually have as many meals as you want, or as many puddings as you want.
Yeah.
It's  it really is  really very, very good.
The Labour Party came to  to use that quite a lot.
Because  they've got  big seating areas as well, where they put, sort of eight tables together and all your party can sit together.
Mm.
When we were there  Stan  was with us and he'd  been a few times to Brussels  to with the Labour Party and, and he said oh it's great!
Because  usually you go off to a restaurant and if there's twenty of you  you can't sit together can you?
No.
No.
But, he said, this restaurant makes a particular thing of  seating big parties.
It was a brilliant restaurant!
Really  really  nice.
So  you know
Sergio's going to erm  erm  one, some Cubs visit to London at er  half term.
Baden Powell House?
Yeah, but the 
Mary took it.
It's brilliant!
Absolutely great!
And er, so she said  she, she wants to take the last couple of days away 
Mm.
so she's, her aunty's going to Dublin, so I got these things and they were really cheap actually.
There's the train fare from here to Holyhead return, the ferry, transfers to their hotel  the best hotel in Dublin, The Burlington
Mm.
is absolutely stupendous!
Two nights bed and breakfast, full Irish breakfast, which means  you won't need to eat until the evening !
You won't eat again.
No.
Erm  train, free bus passes round Dublin, includes their bus fares and, and train on those sort of metro type thing 
Yeah.
they have in Dublin  all for eighty five quid!
Eh?
I know.
Why?
The only problem is, that the hotel that Mary's like, ah!
This looks beautiful.
Cos I, I, that second hotel,hotel, the only thing, is the Burlington.
And I daren't, I'm not gonna tell her, but I, I, I'm trying to say, well, it's a little bit out, it's in a park and er,th th but it looks gorgeous!
I said, yeah I know.
And it was, where they had their honeymoon.
So I'm going, oh no!
Not for   just er  Siobhan, and sister-in-law, erm  is the head of Town and Travel and, Manchester 
Yeah.
Town and Travel, and she got  the  presidential suite at the Burlington which is like a, you know, I mean, erm, it's absolutely gorgeous!
And it was, it was about two hundred pounds a night and got it for ten pounds a night.
That was about, well, ten years ago, when  well  well it's really appropriate.
So I think, well  this is a, this is actually on O'Connell Street, that's right in the centre.
But I mean, that's actually th th one, one of the, that was the, the, the other ones like four star hotels were on O'Connell Street which actually opens   only seventy seven quid.
I know.
That's including all that travel and
Yeah.
and  I mean, it's incredible though!
Mm.
And it's something like twenty quid for an extra night if you want to stay, the problem is the Holyhead ferries, they're dreadful!
You know 
Yeah.
one gets you in at seven fifteen which means  you're only really getting one day
Yeah.
you know, for that price, cos
Yeah.
by the time you got in, checked in, got into the hotel, it's gonna be nine o'clock.
Yeah.
You've missed the day, and, you've got Saturday then,th ferry back is ten o'clock on the Mo or whatever day, but the ferry back is at ten o'clock in the morning so you've got to leave at eight o'clock.
So you really need to go the day before.
I mean, really, you've got to book an extra night to be honest.
Mm.
That's what I mean, you 
Yeah.
Yeah.
there's no point in you going 
No.
for that, I mean, all you're doing is going on a ferry  
I mean if the fe if the ferries were like  early sort of bo got you in at lunch time
Mm.
then that would be alright.
And, and, that you could get say 
Yeah.
Cos you'd have more in the following day.
get say a late afternoon one back.
Cos it's, and it's only about two and half .
Has it got to be on the ferry has it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos it's part of the, that's why it's so cheap.
Part of the hotel.
Yeah.
We need to phone Mayfair.
Oh!
. We need to phone Marion.
I'll do it, it's alright.
It's been an awful long time for this part hasn't it?
Mm.
I mean, it's been a month.
Need to send away for it.
Just shows the state of British industry.
And the recession.
It's foreign int it?
Oh!
That carpet's gotta be done ain't it?
That carpet cleaner's coming.
Don't bother about that, Eileen and I will do it.
Yeah, but we need a new poster though.
gave us a poster.
Alright?
Mm.
One to come.
No.
He's only coming cos you    Oh hi!
It's Mrs  here.
Can you just tell, I can ask if my photocopier part's in?
Thanks .
They erm
We need the sa spare part, when I, I mean we need the sort of  anyway, what was 
Mm.
happening don't we?
And it's , and we also need to see them mend it properly.
I think, we should go for    .
Red and blue square, that, you know  .
I can't, I can't say.
No.
I mean,we could the use the industrial  .
I don't know.
And you could do that in the  all the rest area, you could do it in the whole club to be  honest.
I think you should go for the blocks of colour.
Mm.
Cos, if you got a room, and you spill on it  it wouldn't matter .
Well, I was saying that yesterday to them.
I said .
Right.
Oh God!
Will he?
Cos I'm, I'm getting desperate cos it's getting near the actual time.
Righty-ho!
Thanks.
Speak to you later .
They're gonna chase it up today, he's got quite a few orders outstanding with this company.
Yeah, cos I mean, I were saying that yesterday, that, that little bit of damaged carpet in there  because it's a carpet
Mm.
you've really gotta replace the whole bloody carpet haven't you?
Mm.
But yo you know, if you, you got the tile situation you just 
Mm.
take a tile off  and replace that.
I think you should do the floor
I think we ought to sort of 
lino.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know
Er, well the bulk, the main floor  lino, but the two raised areas and stairs in 
I think you've got to do it in, and I think you've got to do it in brilliant, er brilliant white.
But  get me

That's it, forty three.
 Bruerne's okay.
Yeah, we got one   actually.
Yeah .
You okay for till rolls?
Right.
Are we okay for till rolls?
Yeah?
Just, I think we are Barry, just have 
I haven't 
a look.
Yeah.
I said to him on erm  su er sa Saturday night.
Oh well, he said to me on Saturday he said  do it Thursday  after
Yeah.
I say, so I said, well I'll arrange for a delivery.
But, having said that  he's not the most reliable  person in the world.
Have you given Peter your order?
Yeah.
Oh.
And does he have to be, I mean, are we not gonna be there most of the time?
Yeah.
Co yeah we are.
Well, you are.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah.
I mean, I can be back for  well I mean, I can actually stay there in fact.
Well, do you want the latest?
Yeah.
There's, there's Steve , Dave   er, all the men's meeting at the hideaway
Oh yeah.
is now going to be at the .
We think she should, might stand down gracefully, if she doesn't erm  she, we could refuse to adopt, but she's over there personally.
Erm, I'm in two minds about what to do.
I could  name names and say  because this is not a party decision, it's
Yeah.
Dave , Steve , etcetera, and .
Now, who's Dave ?
Senior employee of the City Council
Yeah.
meeting with  the leader of the Labour group who's  supposedly doing all this to protect his wife.
The reason he's married to her  I mean, even .
I could, I could really throw the dirt at them  by saying that I'll, you know, if there is a conspiracy  there's, a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the budget, who all of a sudden after ten years of  slagging off the town clerk, all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's side, together with  Councillor .
Why?
The only person who's involved in both, allowing the town clerk to take these decisions, without any  interference at all 
Mm.
and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council, and of course,.
Just not so.
Yeah.
All of a sudden this erm  worry about this budget heading, is being swept under the carpets and everybody being told is all in been er  cleared up.
It's Dave  .
I'd fire him.
Mm.
I could really make this into a very great conspiracy for .
Mm.
Apart from which, this meeting that they're supposed to be going to have  is totally out of order anyway.
Cos nobody's been sent any notices for it or notified about it.
So I mean, I, I could
What the hell are they doing now!
get the full meeting cance I mean, you get Ashdown yesterday, his party rally round him like
Mm.
royalty's going of fashion!
You get, I mean, Dave  and Steve , alright, they've never been my favourite people  but  all this pious goings-on with Dave , how much he hates the town clerk, and whatever opportunity he could get  he would 
Mm.
take.
Mm.
First opportunity, real opportunity he gets  he's  doing everything the town clerk wants him to do.
Yeah.
I just, I, I, honestly Barry, I've got to the stage where I believe in this conspiracy .
Mm.
Well certainly some people want  some answers want to be given on this  budget, er me as well, I mean, he can't just suddenly say 
Well 
it's all been sorted out, don't worry about it.
Well  I think it will be really stupid.
But I shall say  Dave   
And how long ?
Well I park
I'll put
er
I'll drop you off.
Cos I want to go home and , I've got to home cos I've  I've a stack of paperwork on my table.
I'm not gonna be able to set off much later on remember because
There's no point in me getting
Nope.
I'll have to go up to shop to get some shopping cos there's  nothing to eat in the house.
So I'll have to do something .
Alright Barry?
I just wonder what on earth they're, they're playing at with  ha, cha cha cha cha cha cha.
You know, I just don't understand what they're playing but th you know 
They 
they can only be doing  damage to th to the election chances I mean 
Well they 
they can't be achieving anything else!
I mean saying things like  a successor has already been identified.
I mean  it's just stupid!
Cos the general view in Morecambe isn't what they say it is.
Yeah, but it gives the impression there's a split group innit?
Well, you give the impression of a  a faction in the party, now  I could, I could serve this faction quite easily  to  Mike  who'd give me a lot of say  if I said, you know,th the  the plot thickens, you know, here's a town 
Yeah.
hall employee
Yeah.
always an opponent of the town clerk  also now  erm  trying to cause problems.
Mm.
I mean, that really does make the plot thicken  doesn't it?
Yeah.
I mean, why was Dave  being quoted for , what has it got to with Dave ?
He's not an officer of the constitut he isn't a treasurer, he isn't secretary, he's, he's nothing  as far the constituency's concerned.
They, if they want any quotes why don't they go and see chairman, who's Terry?
Yeah.
I mean, this is them deliberately saying things to their friends  and deliberately stirring it.
They, oh!
Because, I mean, I know where it's coming from, some of it's coming from Stanley , who, who thinks  if I don't stand down it will damage Ruth's chances.
That's not Ruth's own view of it.
Well it, and I don't think with the News of the World round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people.
Because I'm, you know, if they sa if they keep crossing me the way they are, quite frankly I'm  you know, willing to make remarks myself.
Although I don't want to do damaging things, but  I don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting the flack from a group of people who were  you know.
Yeah.
Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party.
So do you want me to call at the  's now?
Yeah.
There's, may as well.
Well, don't know.
Well it doesn't really matter, I'll, I'll be  I mean, what, so  I mean there's  except for seeing Anne there's nothing more to do is there?
Well except to start getting that rubbish cleared away.
Well I can't put it away.
Don't want a pile in the cellar when carpet delivery comes.
No, but I pu put it next to the lift  and as soon as Hughey comes  put it outside and when I come back I'll take it away.
No you won't cos I'm meeting  Ellial at, at half three.
Well I mean, I should be back for half past two.
I mean, if you want to just put it in that dustbin place and we'll take it tomorrow.
Mm.
You know, the washing up machine and everything, all, all of that needs cleaning out, all behind the bar needs cleaning.
We're giving people a very bad impression if we're opening tonight and  nothing's been cleared up.
I think I'll go for it Barry.
I'll, I'll go and see where he is, and say, you know  That washing up and everything wants doing before tonight so you, so if you're gonna say  oh, we're open tonight and the place still looks like a pig stye!
It ain't gonna give a very good impression.
Well he's not gonna want to, he's not,sha I mean he's  it's not a meeting to look around the place is it really?
Well it is.
That's what they're coming for.
That's one of the things Richard  is coming for, to look round.
We'll come and have a good look round, I've never seen it.
I mean, er, you know what that's to do with don't you?
The repairs notice.
Even if we only got all those old tickets and things into green bags and started cleaning that out it would  it would look as though we're making some  effort.
Er, if I can get  the  and get him to come in  reasonably soon, you know, I'll ring you and tell you whether he's in.
If we could get him to come in reasonably quickly  you could get all that stuff down and bagged up and we could get rid of it couldn't we?
Which which tickets are you talking about?
Well all the old tickets and stuff, I mean, alright 
Where?
From where?
In, the bottom office.
Oh yeah.
As well as all the junk that's in the cleaner's room, it all wants getting rid of.
I mean, what's happening about these speakers then?
I mean, is this supposed to be happening tonight or
No.
what's
Well it's  it's a trial.
Go in then.
Just stop if there's any mail.
No there's nothing.
Oh.
Okay.
I'll go and get in and get on with
Alright.
That's a master key for those .
What do you want?
Well I put that  blue thing  and it's fallen down.
This?
Over here?
Yeah.
And I say, Bernie's room.
See if there's any rubbish er  are those, are those worth keeping those?
Yeah, these are alright.
These are
Yeah.
a couple of them are okay.
It's a full .
Yeah.
Full set.
Yeah, that's what I thought, there's about three or four towels and few  
Makes it complicated.
That's no good.
That's no good is it?
What about these ones?
Aren't you gonna put these in it?
The what?
The  doors over there?
What doors?
These.
Is that a door?
Yeah, in there as well.
We'll stick that  stick that in.
Wanna stick that in or not?
Yeah.
Nothing else?
Well that's  a fire door is it?
we'll have to  take it off this.
Yes.
Sorry.
Right, I'll try and get on with fixing that .
Yeah.
Er
Did you see the match last night?
No, I mean, I saw
Well I never watched it myself.
You know I didn't watch 
I heard the score, I heard the score after that and I never bloody watched it.
Mm.
I, I actually taped it and I was, I was watching a bit this morning before Jean came.
Two one.
Ah?
No, that's a  trestle table.
Are you leaving that there?
Yeah.
Cos I, I wanna take those mikes out and take them.
I mean, that's just a, a brief   using a frame and re-cutting it.
Yeah.
Alright then?
Oh!
Ha ha ah ah!
There's a lot of rubbish in here int there?

Well nothi well we're not anyway because we're not do using those lights any more so
Well sure, then they can come down then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, basically you wanna be quite ruthless and just get rid of
Everything.
everything that's  going to be dumped, and we're not gonna use again.
Ha ha.
Yeah.
Er  and the same out the bottom office.
Erm  just get rid of everything, I mean, how many of these fluorescent tubes are used up?
They must be all done or they wouldn't be down in the first place would they?
I wouldn't have thought so.
I mean why would any
Th they have obviously been used.
Yeah.
That's right.
So why are they taken down?
Yeah.
Repair some of the er  the framework .
Erm
I'll go and get a rubbish bin.

Right, what wha what we're doing, we've got erm
Do you want rid of these then, yeah?
Yeah.
You what?
We're gonna have to walk some of this down aren't we?
Yeah.
Erm
What about the cellar?
Do you wanna tidy that out, or are you just gonna leave the rubbish in it?
Well we're not, taken all the rubbish.

Yeah.
Yeah.
There's just that lot we sent down now, and er
Where did that go?
Er  we took it er
What about this one?
Monday, Monday or Tuesday.
Monday.
What are they?
Oh!
They're over there.
That looks quite useful that.
I'll move that one  we're gonna
Ooh!
we're gonna  Americanize  the club.
How  d'ya mean, Americanize it ?
I'm gonna  turn it into a ma an er American theme, like, you know a  Harley Davidson bits of bike on th th on the walls and  guitars and
Why are they, are they putting some money up 
Yeah.
to do that?
Yeah.
How much?
About fifteen grand at the moment
Phew!
from one brewery.
As much as that?
Well,no non, unsecured loan written off against barrelage.
But, but 
Jesus!
what we've, what we've done is the said job where, where 
Who's doing that?
Erm  Whitbreads.
Erm
Mind you, it's not a lot of money for Whitbread.
Well, yeah, from Whitbread.
No that's right.
I'll go into Wilsons for another fifteen.
 
And put Budweiser on draught.
Boddingtons.
No,Wilso Wilsons do bitter don't they?
Yeah.
Boddingtons  they do.
Whitbread.
Oh!
Wilsons do 
Yeah.
bitter, yeah.
Erm
We've had this before.
Wilsons, Samuel, Sam Smith's  erm it's, it's  th you know, it's  they've all brought each other up now so they can virtually get anything.
Mm.
But I'm, I'm re I'm, what I'm after is Budweiser on draught more than anything else.
I'm gonna have Budweiser, J D  you know, go
Mm.
American stuff.
through the, yeah, I'm gonna 
Mhm.
the thing is, you see, if we do it an American flavour  I mean, people expect heavy rock music in an 
Mm.
American bar don't they?
Mm.
I mean, you expect to be going in and listening to Bon Jovi and, and  Free, and you know  in the background don't you?
You have .
Yeah.
Well I mean
Put in jukeboxes.
Yeah.
I mean, you could be up with the fucking  couldn't you?
For 
Well that's, well, well, well, we're thinking of opening 
Just as a pub like.
yeah, we're gonna open as a pub during the summer  erm
What about all these Barry?
No, we'll keep those for su you never know.
Yeah, okay.
Put them in here?
So we have  and erm  we're gonna open up the top bar, top bar  and ripping up the carpet 
 
in the main room, and lino in the main floor  right, in, in sort of 
Which one?
probably blue 
The  one?
Yeah.
And redoing the stage floor.
And I'm  carpeting  I think I'll carpet tile 
Have you had a price on what it's gonna cost to put that down?
Not that much, cos we're getting the lino off Pete you see, and get the discount off  to do the, just for the lino 
Oh right!
Yeah, course.
and then make it 
Rhona's husband?
Yeah.
Ex-husband, yeah.
Erm, and having a carpet tile  because we can then do it red, white, and, not white, but red and blue  you know.
Yeah.
And, if you 
Yeah.
damage a tile, then you're only replacing a tile.
And just sort of carpet the two top areas, two raised areas, and have the other, the rest of it as a sort of lino  floor.
Mm.
So then, then it, allows to dance as well, and basically  hardly anybody sits in that area until the club's full anyway
Mm mm.
so that they all go in the .
Erm, going to somehow, at the moment we're thinking of  well Jean'll wanna do it, but I'm  I'm thinking of doing some kind of  I mean, we're agreed on what we're gonna do, but it's how we do it, I want some ka er, some kind of grilling around the top, the cocktail bar area, so you can open it as a, as a bar, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself, so we open that as a pub type of thing, you know.
Oh right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Leave the big screen on and that and we can put  erm  and get, you know, as I say, if you 
Do you 
you get, see if we can get hold of like, I mean you won't be able to get hold of a Wurlitzer because nowadays they're like gold dust, but you might be able to get hold of parts, you see.
If you could just get hold of say, the rainbow
Yeah.
effect of a Wurli I mean, that's the beauty about it  you, you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson, but you might get hold of a petrol cap.
Yeah.
You know, or things 
Yeah.
like that, you know 
Yeah.
and you just bang those around the place.
Er, a few handlebars and whatever else and, but, but  but don't do it like the British bikers, do it like an American  bar, so it can be cleaned and
 
I mean it can look nice and 
Yeah.
sparkling and fiftiesey, and  lots of  pictures and
Not the dirty bloody smell and greasy .
No, that's right, yeah.
That's right.
You see, and then if, if, if, if, if sort of people are, you know, holiday makers come in, and it's an American theme, they expect it.
Mm.
As I say, they expect I've got music, it's not gonna come as a shock to them.
They've got  
You know, and it'll, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think.
And, and it won't cost a lot to do, cos all you do instead of green, you'll paint that red  and you've got the white pick out anyway, and a blue, seated blue carpet.
I wondered what those fucking !
No, where am I gonna be able to get rid of this?
I don't know.
I think we'll have to, I think we've got to keep it cos I think it's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately.
 

And I'm gonna do er, you know, lots of  promotions and stuff  promotions  on that 
And then your promotions, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We well what I think I'm gonna do is next Thur not this Thursday, we'll just have to live through this Thursday, but next Thursday, erm  I'm gonna get  get Stella back on, and I'm just gonna sell it as cost, whatever it is, sixty P a pint or whatever.
?
Yeah.
I mean, cos at the end of the day if you've got the, if you've got, if you can get er sixty people 
You'll  
two fifty to come in, I don't mind if I'm giving the booze away!
And er, as long you got the .
As long as you're not losing on it.
Yeah.
Well it doesn't matter does it?
You know  cos that's the only way we're gonna build Thursdays up.
No
That'll be gone then.
Je Jean's  is it?
Right.
Get rid of it.
Oh no, maybe not.
Jean's doing tonight.
I thought it had gone off.
Jean's doing tonight, and I'm doing Friday and Saturday.
So er
She's away int she?
She's away.
Yeah.
Er  but, you know, I, I'd, as I say, I think er  and then if we just, if we can just pick up like the odd  I mean, I've, I've had a  long chat with Anne, we've had a long, erm meeting with Anne  yesterday about it, and she's gonna start pushing  cos you know, she's really done the Royal upstairs, it's 
Mm.
a really beautiful room, but it only holds about forty, fifty people, what she's gonna do is push the weddings, but she's gonna, and say look, you can use this place
For the reception.
For any, any, anything bigger, you know, you've got 
Well for dancing.
Yes.
Yes.
you've got forty people, you want somewhere bigger, then fine.
Cos er, Mark last week said er, he'd been approached by a wedding to do a disco, he said well I can't it's a Saturday, and then he said well, you know, where are you having the reception, said well we're looking round at the moment.
Mm.
Well can't, he said look  have a word, and he said to me, you know, do you mind if we do like eight till eleven o'clock as a wedding party
Right, yeah.
Well 
and then we just do the disco afterwards 
Anyone can stay on if they want can't they?
That's right.
So we just get them in, we open up our doors at ten o'clock.
And I mean, I wanna change the ten o'clock opening, it's bloody silly is that!
That's just bloody ridiculous that!
I mean, we may as well come in at twenty to ten, and, and have twenty minutes of  you know  because, nine thirty   you know.
The only people you get in before nine thirty don't drink anyway do they?
No.
Just 
Well, we don't need to come in .
They did last  when did they come in last week?
Is it Thursday they came in?
Thursday.
Yeah, they came in really early about four of them didn't they?
Oh!
We thought they were, yeah, and they fucking bought one drink between them!
Yeah.
That's right, yeah .
That's right.
Right.
Well you won't want these ?
Er, no I'll leave them.
Leave that, but er
Well,.
What?
Mhm.
Right, I'll leave this .
Should be alright there shouldn't it?
Yeah, well you'll have to leave it anyway.
It's the wrong size actually.
Will I just  dump this whole lot 
Yeah.
?
Yeah.
Then, and then you can  shall I get a  oh that's the other thing, I'm gonna get the toilets redone.
I'm getting the toilets 
I don't know if we can dump this here.
What are they?
Oh, those.
One of them things for the plant or for the  
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh.
What I'm gonna do is get the toilets, I'm gonna get the toilets, the gents toilets, all the urinals ripped out and getting it troughed all the way around 
Yeah.
that L though  and that's why 
But before I got, I er, I suggested that fucking years ago!
I know.
We well we did, we looked at it when we first opened but it was like another grand to do that.
Is it?
Yeah.
Is that what it's gonna cost?
Nine hundred quid to  just, just for the troughing.
Well, so you gotta be fucking right, you, you must be paying nine hundred pound out 
No.
every fucking three months 
That's right.
and all!
That's right.
Well you pa yeah you certainly pay nine hundred pound a year out anyway, damage to the toilet seat and so  you know, that'll pay itself back in a year and, you know.
And also, it's just the hassle  .
Yeah.
And there's, er, I mean it was  showing somebody round the other day and we were talking about it and, and erm  they're saying, yeah I mean, you've got seven urinals there, so let's say you have a busy night, you're full, I mean  that's when damage gets done when people 
Mhm.
are sat around waiting 
Mm.
Mm.
you know, and they're and sat on sinks and whatever else, so  you know, you could, you could get twenty guys on that urinal that you can get for seven.
Erm  well I'm obviously going on  yeah, let's just  I was saying just dump it all.
And er  ah these .
Right, I've just gotta phone Alan upstairs so 
Okay.
a couple of things.
He's  looking at doing a me he's doing a menu of stuff for us so er  will that go in, that'll go in the lift won't it?
Maybe.
Yeah it would.
Yeah it will.

But like er
If you,i i they, they got the brochures in A T Mays.

Yeah.
Er you know 
But anyway, my Dawn, Dawn's mother went down to see a show in London not so long ago, stayed er, stayed two nights in a hotel, it was o it was only like  ninety odd pound for them.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well er, there's erm
There's some brilliant short breaks now.
Oh I know.
Well, there's, there's er  there's one that Mary's lad took his girlfriend on, er two nights London Hilton and train fare  thirty nine quid.
London Hilton!
No so no I think it, no sorry, sorry, not it's not, it's two days  one night.
Sorry, it's one night.
Well if, you're gonna pay a hundred and fifty a night 
Oh yeah.
up in them  
That's right.
Oh yeah.
I mean, but your train fare alone will cost you, it'll cost you  thirty quid.
Course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know when we, we, when we first opened from a dead start  right?
The first fifty five weeks  which is
Just over a year.
a year  we did na on the bar did ninety thousand quid.
Jesus!
The next five months  less than half a year  af the next five months after that right?
When Jean stopped doing her silly things?
Yeah.
Well, yeah, when  whe er er a after that first year the next five months  seventy nine thousand!
Fucking hell!
In five months.
So if we'd have carried on at that 
So you would have like, you would have well doubled that.
Yeah.
I mean tha th we, it, have been 
Five months you would have equalled .
Well I think we'd have gone to  two hundred thousand.
Yeah.
But that, at the end of that period was when  Volks recalled the loan.
Aye.
And 
And 
you were buying seventy off them or something?
Yeah.
But er, but when 
You were getting all your orders from them at that time?
Yeah.
But when  Volks recalled the loan  we sort of give up.
Yeah.
I, we went two day week opening and not publicizing it, everything.
Yeah.
So if we'd have just carried on the way that was going, I mean, that got it from ninety thousand in  just over a year  to, to seventy nine thousand in five months.
Jesus!
It's amazing!
Know what I mean, like we didn't want 
Surely they've saw the trend?
Well
You did show them?
I think
No Barry don't  I don't  you're not fucking doing nothing !

Looks like a motorbike handlebars you can stick it on the wall.
What about this milk, milk machine?
No, bung it.
Whoops.
Over there.
Look at all that shit there!

I'm gonna fix that, no do I'll, yeah I'll bring some from home cos I wan I wanna nip home for er  an hour  and I'll er  I've just seen Anne.
What are you doing with these for?
Erm  American stuff for
Mm.
Yeah.
I'm gonna do like  chillies and  whatever, you know.
She, she can re do them and we just have, microwave them when, as and when.
Ah.
I need  somebody in to do that.
The bar staff could do that like.
Ye oh yeah.
Could they?
I think
Yeah.
just get them all  you can get them  for them.
Yeah.
Have them fucking ready made up and just 
Cos 
move them out.
Cos even 
Simple!
even ri I mean rice does really well in a microwave.
Well you can have them in the freezer.
You can freeze rice and then put it straight in the microwave.
Yeah.
Just, just to sprinkle on water on them.
Just seal them up  with a   fuck it's called?
That cling film stuff.
Yeah.
Right.
I've just snapped the screwdriver!
I bet you it's an ordinary  screwdriver.
No.
No, it's a  my word!
Don't touch them things  grease on it.
Shit!
Why is it cleaner's rooms always end up like this?
Dirtiest room in the whole  
Yeah.
See this was, this was the dance floor before
Yeah.
er, where it follows this line.
Yeah.
And it was a sort of  funny shaped thing.
Yeah.
Just to here.
And it was like, nothing, so we just extended all this out  and made it into a stage come, a bigger dance floor cos the I don't know why they wa always seem to have this trends that, they have these trends in the seventies and that was, and eighties of having small dance floors 
Right tiny dance floors, yeah.
Right, that's  and the disco console was open to the public so the public could just wander in and tap the D J on the  back and tu change his records for him or whatever.
It's a  stupid opera so we've fenced that in.
Erm  but this is the area up here  Anne, that I was sort of thinking that we could  if we can, some kind of trellis or something  around this raised area here  you could actually open this bit  as the, as a pub on a
With what?
Sorry!
as a sort of pub, you know, on a Saturday and Sunday in the season.
Food and that.
You know, and with a big screen you can have like  sport or Grandstand or
Right.
ro music videos or whatever you wanna do.
Get satellite in and get M T V on.
Mind you, the satellite's gonna cost three hundred quid!
Roughly.
This is like cocktail bar bit
Yeah.
isn't it?
Yeah.
I mean, change all the, paint o pa paint all the, change all the green to sort of red 
Green shouldn't be up anyway.
Yeah.
Red, and then you got the white pick out
Yeah.
and you got the blue seats, so you've got red, white and blue haven't you?
Yeah.
They aren't cheap chairs these either 
Yeah.
are they?
Oh no.
Nothing was cheap, I mean 
No I wouldn't have thought it was.
the seats are good, you know, these tables are bloody heavy!
And they've done a  you know, they did a good job when they built it.
Erm  I mean, you can see what he, what he intended doing  was  the plans were beautiful!
This was  gonna be  there's a piano there on that 
Mm.
raised area there, so this was like a piano bar
Yeah.
there was gonna be a big fountain  in the middle there
Yeah.
this wasn't gonna be disco
No.
a big fountain in the middle there
Yeah.
and an orange grow
Yeah.
type affect, it was gonna be called the ora this was the blue one, so that was the orange
Yeah.
purple, whatever.
The bar was a double-sided open
Bar across that other side?
Yeah.
Great!
And the other side
Yeah.
which was gonna be a big glassed disco
Yeah.
in there, and that was gonna be the disco, and this was the, you know, I mean it was a good idea, I don't know why he pulled out with  went half-cock.
Erm  you know.
True.
These are the things we were talking about yesterday  these uprights.
I mean they just
Erm 
open for
well you could shorten them anyway.
Yeah.
You could just shorten them And 
I mean they're very sort of vandal  easy or whatever.
Vandal a fa er vandal friendly  hooligan friendly aren't they?
Yeah.
Whatever!
You know, I mean we just got them cheap  erm  lampshades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time.
We could shorten them anyway and just put lamps on them.
Yeah.
Whatever.
If you don't hang them on Gerry's  thingy anyway.
No you don't.
That's right.
See, if you sort of somehow trellis that area, that side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people just wanted to
Snog!
sit in here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you got, you know, if you got a character behind the bar  could er  attract people  by his own force of personality.
I think erm  you could  but you know, really then you think when 
Mm.
they come in we can start 
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah it is.
Cos I wouldn't lo I mean I actually don't think you can do, if you're gonna do  people are gonna eat I th I think you're gonna be pushed at  more than about hundred and fifty to two hundred.
You know, depends on how you retail it first but 
I think it depends which it, what you 
Yeah.
do.
Yeah.
Erm
I mean, it depends a as you say, er yeah I mean it does depend that.
Cos if, if you, if you, if you wanted to you could always utilize all the dance floor area  tables and things, you know.
If you had that kind of function that you  you know
Mm.
Makes it difficult to do a big functions though in here with that stage.
Oh yeah.
You know, to set out 
Yeah.
you co there's no way 
Yeah it does.
you can set out for two hundred.
No.
No.
What we did do 
And so 
very well
Yeah.
erm  we were we some of the jazz stuff, I mean 
Yeah.
it  it, it never worked in a sense that it wasn't commercially viable
No.
but  things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had 
Yeah.
and we had like the ta trestle tables in all these alcoves and people came and actually booked a meal
Yeah.
and, and, you had a meal and sat and watched  the band and everything.
It wor i I mean  for those  it did work 
Different  sort of like 
it did work.
Yeah.
Just 
But 
need the
you can see everywhere.
And it did 
Put hot food 
Yeah.
up at the back as well there.
Mm.
Have you actually  ever seen round this place properly?
Not properly.
No I haven't really.
Whe whe where do you get to that round, round 
No.
part?
No, you can't that's one of the  do you wanna sta I'll just go and get the key so you can have a 
Yeah, go on.
quick look in there.
I'll go up there.
Get your bearings.
Yeah.
It actually looks bigger looking that way  than it does when you're up there looking back, I think.
Erm  I'm thinking of atmosphere.
But if we  if we carpet the two raised areas in a sort of  attract hardwearing linoey type affect on there cos you can 
What about the slipping?
you can dance.
Well  you get
The carpet, don't it really up here?
No.
Well i it's been down  since it opened so that's
Oh!
gotta be eight or nine years.
Mm!
It's done well then.
It's done well.
It was on 
Yeah.
concrete 
Yeah.
like.
Oh right.
So this is just, this is just virtually there, you can't get through that way anywhere?
No you can't, no.
Oh.
Right.
Like, so it's sort of self-contained  in one 
Yeah.
sense.
Er
Right.
So it'll have to be that one in there.
And
Oh!
So  right.
Right.
When Trish  had a  do  in here, her fortieth  she let 
A what?
er Trish  had her fortieth birthday  here.
She laid  there's a tremendous amount of wasted space here  really.
There is!
Erm
Ah!
This stage across.
Yeah.
She laid out in here and people just wandered in off the back end  here.
Yeah.
But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we can't really  we built that wall here  and it's just a  this is the back of the disco.
I mean  al it's all, none of it's sort of 
Determined wall.
determined walls, I mean, it's no  no wall there at all.
I mean we put this up just 
Yeah.
to break that 
Yeah.
because this is the console bar.
Is that Cola?
It's for  it's for the cellar, yeah.
This is nice and big innit?
Well it's not, I mean
Should think they've had quite a few .
Not bad.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Obviously you've got a better eye tha than I have, but er
You wa er what you want in here is one tha is tha is what's e what's extraction like?
Is it good?
Fine.
You want a chair for over here for doing 
Yeah.
American stuff.
Yeah, you do, yeah.
Do  kebabs and everything.
Yeah.
We've got erm  somewhere, a pizza oven.
Oh!
You, have you got a 
Yeah.
pizza oven?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
So that's alright.
I've enough afternoons .
Well, you won't need to do that now.
It's somewhere anyway, we've got 
Jesus wept!
pizza oven.
What is it?
Ice making machine.
What's that, a dishwasher?
Glass washer, yeah.
Glass washer, I meant.
We've got er 
Have you got one behind bar?
No.
There's not.
There int one behind the bar?
No.
Oh out in garden.
Oh right!
I see.
So basically they've gotta just tray it up
What you want is 
tray it up here and then 
yeah, here and then
bang it straight in.
Erm
Why's your bar so high?
I can't reach your pump  .
Yeah.
Have you?
We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff can't run away!
Oh I see.
Once they're behind here they're stuck all night.
Think you got some cleaning, you just want  that back in.
Mm.
You know what I mean, it's got  .
And all that up there.
Mm!
Now then, so you'd  carpet them two
Yeah.
and then  summat  washed
Well you see, hardly anybody ever sa they don't really sit in this area, all they do is er, I mean, they only sit 
Around the bar.
right at the end of the, you know 
Yeah.
when it's full  they'll sit on those two tables.
You were going to clear that area anyway, don't they?
Yeah.
I mean, everybody round here just stands  or sits on those bar stools.
Mm.
Yeah.
When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down.
O 
You have to see.
or they stand at the bar.
It's, and, and if you actually look on the actual area we're talking about, there's only one, two, three, four, there's only about  half a dozen tables.
Yeah.
Which is, you know, at maximum you're gonna get twenty four people sat around there anyway.
So I think, in a way, it's erm  a bit wasted carpeting it all.
Cos it's a big area 
I do.
to carpet.
One, two, three
I mean  the quotes we had ranged from sort of
Well you,wo did you look to change the carpet 
eighteen to twenty seven.
because of the name on it?
Well  yeah, and 
You are?
and it's getting past it to be honest.
I mean, these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license, they weren't gonna give us it because the carpet was lifting.
Yeah.
So  I mean, not, weren't gonna give us it, but we had to do it for
Yeah.
you know, at the time.
Yeah.
And you can see like  like there  can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet, but there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage.
Oh right, I see.
There's one there.
I mean
Yeah.
if you've got it carpeted, once you got that you, you're  you're stuck aren't you?
You know 
Yeah.
you've either got  I mean, we've either gotta put a  table on top of it or  
Yeah, that's it, or sit on there or get 
Yeah.
somebody to stand with it 
 
you know.
Yes.
Erm  or replace the whole damn carpet.
I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune  !
Bloody hell!
It must, it must have been absolute  arm and a leg.
Mm.
Absolute arm and a leg.
Er  
But it  it's not a bad size room in the sense that 
No it int, no, it's, it is 
in the sense that you can get three hundred in
Mm.
well we often get four hundred in if you're  you know, I mean, just have the right 
Mm.
party  erm
How many you licensed for?
Three hundred.
Three.
But, you can get  but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well.
Mm.
You know, it 
Well that, that's good you see 
Yeah.
cos I mean some places that are fairly big  th the, if you've got hundred in they just, it looks empty don't it?
No that's right.
That's right.
I mean 
Erm 
that's the Carlton's problem innit?
You know, if it, unless it gets 
Ooh!
God!
Yeah.
unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if you're in a barn  aircraft hanger.
Well that's right.
Mm.
But the sort of  chromea and all that sort of lends itself to one of them aircraft things doesn't 
Yeah.
it?
Yeah.
It does.
It does, yeah.
So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on, on, on  I mean it's only a matter of  most of it's a matter of paint, and then hanging a few things up isn't it?
Change the atmosphere.
Well er, yeah well it is, but I think  cos one, you've got to look at, oh a bit of a design as well a while you're at it you might as well just get one or two bits
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
you know 
Yeah, yeah.
True.
Erm  oh yeah.
One, two  it's alright, I'm trying to  think.
if you're gonna  make all this into a dance floor and all the rest of it what's the be a er er er  benefit of having a stage?
If all this is virtually gonna be  it's virtually gonna be dance floor int it really?
Mm.
Well there is no benefit.
Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more viable  in as much as erm, the point of view of doing  doing catering  and, functions and all the rest of it.
You can't, you couldn't  say right we'll do a function for  hundred and fifty and two hundred, and really to do, you've got to be looking to do a, a sit down function for two hundred
Right.
if you, because  it's more than the Headway can do 
Yeah.
comfortably.
And it's more than  er, and you can certainly do a better job than the Carlton so  I mean, you don't call, I mean, you don't call him any  competition at all I don't  but, you've got to look at being able to do functions for two hundred.
Mm.
Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it?
Well it is, but having, yeah but with their 
Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms?
I'm talking about the Carlton.
Right.
Not Chelstons.
Not Chelstons, right.
The Carlton up 
Right.
here.
Yeah.
It, really and truthfully, like the Headway do plenty of functions and the rest of it  but  you can do a better job than Headway.
Mm.
No two ways about,wi it  in a min in a .
But if you can do, if, if you can do a two hundred thing for sit down  you're gonna be in among the functions.
Mm.
Definitely.
Plus the fact like you sa er like I say, if you're gonna have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the raised area is there?
No, that's very true.
And er, and it, it  it makes a lot of difference actually.
I would have thought so.
Mm.
I mean, cos the bands can still set up can't they?
Oh yeah.
If they sit up  here 
Well you can do what, yeah.
Yeah.
But they still sit up there and they can still see them.
Mm.
And it's makes it a  it makes it a different space, totally different.
Mm.
And like I say, if you're gonna carpet it  er not carpet it, you're gonna cover it  you might as well cover it  totally.
Oh yeah.
Well 
I wonder what you'd use though?
You ca you're gonna, you're gonna cover it, I mean we've got to re 
You've gotta cover that anyway.
we've got to re-cover that 
That's what 
stage anyway.
So you're not  so all you're 
So 
doing is taking that out, but 
Yeah.
surely in a lot of ways it might  makes all the difference Barry.
Mm.
Makes it  and it makes in a way  so that it, it's not a
Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and chairs.
Yeah, course you can.
All you do is just  put them round there.
Just put them round.
I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House
Well that's  terrific!
they've got er actual  flat floors.
Get rid of all that and you have got more table area because  i they can sort of sit in th in the, the 
Yeah.
gangway
Yeah.
you know, so I think, I think that would  it's alright I just keep freezing up.
Do you wanna sit in there rather than 
No my, I'm better stood here.
Oh.
No I'm better stood here.
But I've got to  I do this you know, I just sit and look.
Mm.
Oh no, I don't stand a lot.
 
Well that's  but I've, I've got to er, so I think definitely that wants to come out.
Erm  and er
Because, I mean, if you ever got anything you really need a little, you could always bring a little stage in.
Well   Yeah.
Staging's no problem is 
No.
it?
No.
You know
I mean
now we need erm  alright we're gonna, we'll keep  these mirrors and everything.
Them mirror tiles and everything.
I should think so.
They cost us a fortune!
Cos I mean them marked .
I nearly ca what they call it?
Aren't they?
Mm.
Called the .
Er, it's just that re-seating that  just on that middle one actually, that's bad int it?
Mm.
Well I've,yo you need to redo the, the fixed seating.
I mean, some of it o you'll get away with, but generally you re you need to recover it, it's going all over the place  and it
What if you could get something with stars and stripes on?
Mm.
Yes, but it's dirt  on it.
The trouble with the American red, it's a, it's, it's not a maroon it's a
No, it's
bright pillar box type 
Mm.
red innit?
Yes.
You know it's
Oh my God!
You don't want to 
So if anybody, if anybody spills anything on it or whatever 
Mm.
it's gonna show like a .
Yeah.
Well that's one's left, cos that one, well it's better than green when it's down isn't it?
Mm.
But I thi 
I know that sort of creates that atmosphere there but I think erm  sorry!
Go on.
Get them lamps down, I think.
Cos I mean,yo you can easily chop them off and put summat else smaller on can't you with lamps on?
Mm.
If you want to create that sort of an atmosphere.
Are we  there int a door is there from kitchen to there?
Well it's
There's just a hatch which is alright 
Yeah.
because then  well that'll just do service from there, but the only trouble about that is that .
Anyway, not to worry.
Alright.
Round again then.
Nay problem.
I mean, if you've got a function you haven't got that much of bar trade
No, but 
in the sense that 
No.
being busy have you?
No.
You know.
No.
No.
And is  erm  yeah I think that'd make all the difference if that comes out.
You can soon redo the D J's little er
Oh yeah.
No, I think you'd leave the D J's  
Oh yeah, but I mean you can soon sort of make it so that it's er 
Oh yeah, well  Jean keeps buying 
it's extended.
Jean keeps,Jean keeps buying these  this atrocious cheap wallpaper and sticking it everywhere !
Oh my God!
Look at that !
Well yeah, it looks erm  you can put same thing up, but properly.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Erm  that's that 
Well on that you could do something stars and stripesey all round there couldn't you?
Yeah you could.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No problem.
Sort of have it all over    Who is it's gonna come and see me on Monday?
Er  Websters?
Wilsons?
Woodbinder?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm  throwing money about a bit.
You don't wanna throw about.
Anyway, it, it, it, it, it's just   they're gonna, gonna come and see me, gonna bring me a list of what they have.
The  
Right.
and all that.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Erm  they do erm, I'll tell you what they do.
They've got  they do Woodbinder obviously.
Yeah.
They put the new, new .
Woodbinder long neck 
 
or summat in bottles.
Mm.
Wish I could find my glasses she said.
Right!
Ca er er  Miller Lite,Kor or summat
Yeah.
Kronenburg wha Sixteen Sixty Four.
Mm.
Carlsberg  and Carlsb o is it export, that 
Yeah.
strong stuff?
Hoffmeister  Holsten and Holsten Export, er, Michelob tha but, he's gonna bring me a 
Mm.
Tiger 
Right.
beer or summat.
Oh yes, I've heard of that.
Yeah.
They do, they
Well Co , Miller and Bud are all  American beer.
Yeah.
Well that's what he said.
Erm  but they John Smith range as well you see.
Yeah.
Cos that's Miller Lite int it?
Erm  so he's coming on, he's coming for his, he's bringing the  on Monday.
Nice lad him.
Yeah.
Really nice lad.
So erm  I went to, where is it you said?
Couldn't find one American  cookery book.
Well that int true, I could find one and it were twenty seven pounds fifty so I left it was, full of pretty pictures!
 
Isn't that a lot?
Yeah.
But I found some barbecue recipes and all that that'd be good.
Yeah, I mean, the other thing on, on American of course, is you can do all that Cajun stuff can't you?
Yeah, that's, that's, yes, that's what I wanna 
And New Orleans area, you know.
that's what I thought because I've got erm  I've got a  somewhere, I've got four hundred and some cookery book!
Oh.
I've never been interested in American stuff.
Well Cajun stuff and all that I thought, and then there's them  you can do some long kebabs and all that, that's why if we get one of them charcoal grills that you can  pa shoo, shee shoo .
You know, not er  all easy.
And, and if you're gonna do burgers we'll do  proper burgers, you know  not  .
But you can do like, you can do vegetarian burgers and all sorts.
So erm  is that paper up there?
Yeah.
Look erm  could do with being , having a doorway across back of here couldn't they?
Oh!
I don't know though  bu er, opening and shutting doors don't appeal to me  when you .
No.
No.
True.
Looks nice but
Yeah I mean this looks  almost like a school  but I mean
Well, no, well, I thi but I think some, some  you're better with two shelves really.
In, in a way for for quick, quick 
Well nowadays, nowadays everybody wants two drinks anyway don't 
Yeah.
they?
I mean it's not like 
No, but, but 
it used to be a
Yeah.
everybody wanted warm  
When you think about if you  just  serving two or three hundred  to keep opening and shutting bloody cupboard doors, erm, fridge doors, it's no good.
Chill's best, I think anyway.
Mm.
So erm  so, yeah, right, I've got  oh!
Yeah, I thi yeah I think you're right actually.
You need to get rid of that and it's  and create a dance floor
Yeah, create 
what, and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in
Yes.
no, those spots around 
Yeah.
there shining on the 
Yeah.
floor, put some round the back so 
Yeah.
you actually just use
Yeah.
see, but I er, I think creative use of spotlights is better  than, than specialized lighting effects, which A, cost a fortune, but B 
And you get out of 
as soon as you've seen them they're out of date.
Well that's it.
That's right.
Cos they're only effective one time, that's the first time you see them.
, yeah.
After that, it's
And we don't want to fork, I mean,
No.
No.
So erm  I mean you can just use coloured spots it in, I mean, those at the moment are just literally stage spots, all they are i are on, and on dim 
Oh right.
Yeah.
then you can dim them up or whatever 
Yeah, I have them
but they can't flash
No.
so what we need is a small unit in there and, and, I mean, it's only  two or three hundred quid  er, and a few erm
Most places where erm, you know they've got them in that, where you go to
Yeah.
you can pick stuff up for next to nowt.
Just have it ready- made, say you want it for
Yeah.
Well, marvellous!
But I think er  er  yeah I think that's definite, take that out, it really, it really would make  the difference to erm
Yeah it would, actually, thinking about it.
Would, it'd make it  it'd make it  well, it'd just transform it, I mean, just no two ways about it, I think.
You've got that erm  what time's that chap coming, half past three?
Yeah.
Well I think er  is this, alright if I look in here or 
Yeah, course.
I'll just get my erm
Yeah, I mean i it's  keep on walking round till you get familiar with it.
Yeah, well that, I mean, I just, yeah, cos I need 
In 
to
in there is  staff toilets and your spirit store.
Oh.
Yeah, where's thingy?
Food store in here.
Where, where 
And it's locked.
yeah, but where's erm
Cellar?
Yeah.
Down below the bottom.
Yeah.
Right down, and how, do you have to go outside to get to it?
That's a bit silly!
It's a pain in the neck!
But it's er
Well that's how it is at the minute innit?
So
But, now, Volks actually looked at  erm  buildi putting a lift in and building a lift to it.
Oh!
You can't be doing with that.
I mean  but okay, well all it means is, you get twen yo once you start getting busy you get twenty twos not elevens.
I mean
And thirty sixes eventually .
And thirty sixes that's right.
Yeah.
But er  we've got  three stand up freezers  and the 
Yeah, you could have loads, there's, there's loads of room if you, could ge if you, if you bring that  do it in here 
In the chest freezer.
freezer.
Chest  those are, those are freezers.
That's 
Good spaces.
that's a chest freezer.
Yeah well
So you got three standing, one chest, and a fridge.
Oh there's loads of room in there.
Yeah.
And then it's er
That's the lift down into the cellar.
I'm not riding down in that!
So, she could  send, you can send stuff down in that can you?
Yeah, it takes erm  you can get half a dozen crates in  you could get eleven gallon if you wanted.
Oh aye.
Cos you'll have to keep your beer down there won't you?
Yeah.
Are there any way I can , oh mind you, you've to get it up anyway haven't you?
Yes.
You see look  lots of people'll write on there  won't they?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's right.
Better, just, you just, in sa well I don't mean better but it just  makes just the difference now so  what can I say?.
National Scutters.
That's er, from a rally.
Oh yeah!
Oh right.
Association of Rallies .
Right.
I don't think that looks different like that.
So  that's so big.
See the  but er, this room  drives me up the wall!
I mean I
Go on, tell me again.
Is that back of stage?
This is back of the stage.
And back of disco.
Yeah, back o back a  no  it's the D J 
This is the back  this is, the D J  is here
Oh right!
Yes.
This is just a back wall that is
So really, if we got shot of all that cos really, you want to make another hatch 
Give it a bit more room.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which then would make
Yeah..
Oh my God!
Done it again!
I thought I'm hearing  yeah, you could make a ra er you can make another hatch.
Yeah, could  but
It should erm
Or you can do all these round here.
Yeah.
And you could have this for your preparation area if you want.
Yeah.
Cos when  er   side int it?
It's just happened to  er  you're gonna have to get some what they call it?
The  things showing round there  them  .
You don't want it 
I don't smoke.
Oh well  they're not, I mean, they're not put out for 
Yeah, it's a big .
Oh!?
Oh!
Have to be really aren't they?
Mm.
Right there's a  so I mean  say 
I mean at the moment all the food is  is protecting the license cos you've got to do food, food up to two o'clock.
You've got to have food available.
Oh yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
So I mean, we're just going through the motions at the moment, I mean, quite hone 
But you have food?
Yeah.
But I mean quite honestly we haven't   
No, that's a, that's, right, but I mean that's  neither here nor there is it?
No.
But you see, you've got the potential to do a big opera a bigger operation.
Mm.
You see, and er 
Well that's where, I mean, you can make money on the food sometimes can't you?
And that's, that's where you've got
Make the money, yeah.
And this is why takes  to get all this down and get  get a location  better than the Carlton for the, I mean, alright, we aren't gonna be able to do the three or four hundred, but then we 
No, no.
I can't imagine anything worse than doing a function for three or four  because by the, by the laws of average how the hell are you gonna get it out to them all as it should be?
I mean,de a I, I think he doesn't do a bad job on to be fair 
No, he doesn't.
I mean he does the big functions and he doesn't do a bad job 
No he doesn't.
he's better than he was a few years ago and
Ah yeah.
and, and
Oh yeah, definitely
he's
yeah.
A he's  I think Rob gets a bit ups a bit wound up because there's no
I tell you what amazes me, Mary, he takes, he can take a conference, when they have a big do he puts them there for the, you know for their dinner or whatever they 
Yeah.
got there.
And, he's, she s keeps on at him all the time, he's never taken a photograph of the place  laid out for a big dinner.
So she keeps sort of saying  well of course, er, you're taking an organizer round the disco aren't you?
You're like, you know, he's stood in the disco and you go to him 
Yeah.
well it's all laid 
Yeah.
out.
Well they'd like, I'd like to know 
They've gotta imagine it, you ought to have like a  pull 
Yeah.
a photograph and say oomph!
Say that we want it set up in here with a photograph and that wants to be on the thing outsi 
Yeah.
in the cape outside.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm  but to do, but like I say, if you've got somewhere that could just er  er  you see, cos I mean what, the most we can do is fifty
Mm.
down there.
That's right.
Then er  which is nice,i it  forty's lovely!
Forty's absolutely lovely to do.
And that, and that's it, but I mean, to do, to have somewhere to do two hundred like this would be absolutely incredible!
Could always do small weddings down there and, and then the big do 
Mm.
at night up here.
That'd make  that just totally makes it different.
I want to just go and have a look in them  you see if you've  well anyway   Well erm, I might get  to a certain extent.
Cos you're nearly 
Yeah.
aren't you?
Mm.
Again, this is look   it's the same as this.
Shit!
Well where's that go?
That's the fire escape down to outside.
Oh so you couldn't you'd have to leave them  
No you can't, no you can't, no.
But  that's that area we were looking at.
Either side of the disco console.
That's the passageway we just walked down.
And that's the area you were banging.
Oh that's where I were banging on wall?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Well that'd be fine  because then it means that you've got either  you've got your back in
Mm.
and out, or whichever way 
Yeah.
round you 
Yeah.
want to do it.
So that fine, all this comes down.
And you can still sort of ma make it elevated up this really nice and
Mm.
whatever.
That's that wallpaper int it?
Yeah !
Right, so this is 
It's actually you know, if you took the time you make a tremendous, it'd make a tremendous  big area wouldn't it?
Brilliant!
No messing!
Right, depends what the  and quite honestly, if you bring these down  and make them a bit more romantic
Yeah.
you know.
God knows what they'll get up to!
Well I a don't give a bugger, me!
 
I aren't bothered for them.
Fifteen  there's fifteen there and whatever they need here.
Thirty seven.
See you could seat fifty on here.
Yeah.
I, I think I ca I, once upon a time I did on the fixed seating for, for  I think you could get about a hundred and twenty round 
Yeah.
there.
O as it is?
Yeah.
As it is.
Yeah.
Packed out.
Er 
But you see the other thing, the other thing that er that's worth, when you've had the smaller dos, you know 
Mm.
sort of even, even like sixty, eighty people  you can lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet area 
Oh the buffet, yeah.
Yeah.
which kills a lot 
Yeah.
of space in the club.
Yeah.
The only thing that worries me about taking that out is that you then create a massive  empty space, if you have got 
No you don't.
sixty, seventy people you have to then
No you don't because what you do is, you do it down there.
Well
And this is off
Yeah.
innit?
Yeah.
Then you go back and sit up there.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You do it down there, and this is erm  if you did it over there it would look absolutely dreadful!
You do it down there, you set it up in the middle and you set it up really nice and cosy.
Mm.
And then er
We got a lot, we got a, quite a lot of these little blue tables so you could actually
Yeah.
surround the dance floors 
Oh yes.
No, no 
but we
messing.
push, you know, push people into the dance floor so they're there anyway.
Yeah, and you make a totally, you make a totally different erm  it's, it  in one sort of minor operation if you like, alright, minor to a 
Mm.
certain extent, you've totally transformed it Barry.
Mm.
And it, it 
That's right.
definitely looks so different.
I mean, even if you didn't do anything else.
Mm.
But I think erm, you've just got to er, we've just got to er   gerrit sorted.
It, it, it int gonna take much sorting  and get the  you know
Mm.
We could use that chrome railing around
Well you co 
area 
yeah you could use that chrome railing elsewhere, we could 
Mm.
you know.
I don't think you, you've, you've got to try in a way not to shut it off  too much  erm  and yet it,i you've just got to sort of be able to  not shut it off but sort of create different areas
Mm.
within one big area  i i if you can and I think shutting things, I think putting trellising up to, not trellising but  that sort of thing, to a certain extent at the minute  we don't need and  I think  I'll have to come a time er too when it's open as well to get
Now,wha what I was just thinking of
Yes.
But it could be just on a Saturday and Sun 
is it, if you, if you're using, if you're gonna use it as a pub as well 
Mm.
on a Saturday and a Sunday 
Mm.
which I think you can do with Amer certainly in the summer season  if you Americanize it and all that and, and just, well I mean, we, we did 
You could have a glorious MacDonalds couldn't you?
Yeah.
That's right.
Then, you know  you wanna start from that and build back out bits 
Yeah.
you know 
Definitely 
cos I mean if they walked into here on stood on that bar hundred and twenty people 
Well actually you don't want them, you want them in here and bar's there.
Well that's right.
And that's the bar they use.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
You don't sort of use
No we have that closed and
Yeah.
and try and sort 
Yeah.
of shutter it off in some 
Yeah.
way.
I mean maybe 
Well I think 
maybe even getting  literally shutters rather than those grills.
And then you can 
No, I think, I think, I think
I tell you what   we had Laura, Jean's daughter had erm  a nurses' dinner here  it was about,the they wanted to come on a, on a disco night but 
Mm.
they wanted a meal beforehand 
Yeah.
Yeah.
so we did like a meal for, I think there was about thirty of them
Yeah.
and we put them onto that area
Yeah.
and er  and I said to Laura, ah I know, I'll put so I'll, I'll, I'll put something on the big screen so you know, some videos whatever.
I said, ooh!
I'll tell you what, I've got Live Aid  all taped on  you know, from years ago
Mm.
so she said oh that'll be good!
So I put Live Aid on.
Course, I'm sat in the office like this, and they're all sitting down to their lovely fo five course meal and of course great!
First couple of bands on, then it stops and shows about quarter of an hour  starving kids !
Oh!
I know, yeah.
That
And I went, I went oh no!
 
I had to leave 
Yeah.
it off .
Yeah.
So, so that's  like a video thing?
Yeah.
Or T V.
You can have, you can have normal T V on there
Yeah.
or video.
Erm
So is that where it comes from up there?
It all comes from, yeah.
Yeah.
Well it's controlled ba back in there, that's where 
Oh right.
it's connected from.
Yeah.
Right.
And you can actually see it from everywhere in the club except for that corner there.
What, seen, what have you been to that Liberti is it Liberties by the town church?
Have you been in there?
No, I haven't been in there.
I mi ha I'll, I'll, you ought to go in.
I'd like to go actually.
Yeah.
Yeah, I must, I must have been, I haven't, no I haven't been.
I mean, I've been in there when it  unless he's drastically altered it
it only used to hold about a hundred people.
It was only licensed for a hundred people.
It's a video thing int it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Isn't it?
I don't know what he's done inside, but  yeah I like that.
I has he still got it then or is it,i re oh receiver Steve that got it 
I'm not sure.
ain't it?
Yeah.
Mi I'm not sure.
And Bob  is taking Churchills over this week 
That's right.
is he?
Is he?
Is it this week?
I knew he was getting it.
He'll be ups absolutely, he must be absolutely 
No he's just come back from Tunisia on holiday so he'll need it.
that I'd need it, he'll be going in, in with bloody mob if I'd have done it.
Stupid he is!
What did Fred talk him into all this for the blame won't he?
Talking him into   there's not,no they don't  got to be doing meals or owt upstairs.
No.
Mind you, then maybe that comes with time of year, mind you, I'm not doing any either.
So
Having said that I, you know, I mean,i i i exc i if he's not gonna do that
Well even if he 
or even if he, even if he is doing that  he's not gonna, he's not gonna 
I mean, cos you've gotta do it better than him.
do it very well.
Erm
But I think if, if same as er 
Carlton is far too big for the Abbey!
I mean, like our cricket club dinner, I mean  we have  it's usually between sort of eighty, and a hundred and twenty people, but 
Mm.
I mean  we must, they must spend twenty quid a head at the bar 
Mm.
at least.
We could get them here nicely.
Yeah.
Be absolutely .
But we, but we go to the Carlton, well so 
Mm.
I've been to.
I mean, we've been all round but the last three years we've stayed at Carlton 
Mm.
I said, he's done a pretty good job.
Yeah.
But there's no reason why you don't do  you know
But I, I tell you, really, you'd, you'd  and something different because I mean like you go to the Headway and it's just the same 
Yeah.
the beer's bloody awful!
Well the other thing that's really good is, cos you've all got that set up cos it is a disco
Yeah.
you don't have to upset people 
Charge it i 
and 
No!
bring gear in while they're eating and be setting 
No, no, no, no, no.
up and
No, no messing about, no.
testing the equipment and all that sort of stuff.
No, no, no.
No you see it's all there.
I think
The D J 
that's 
plays background music while you're eating 
While you're eating.
and then  winds it up when you 
Yeah.
when you want, you know.
When you want, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
It makes  makes it  you know  and then we jus you just  ah, have, we'll just have, I mean ceiling's right in blue, so I mean 
Mm.
you know.
What sort of paint is it that?
Well these damn, these bloody tiles cost a fortune!
They say just  I mean we,yo th there's bits and pieces of like  you know
Yeah, I mean 
like you have to redo some of tiles but a lot of them .
Er, excuse me !
Ooh!
Pardon me.
And even things like the cocktail side  I mean, although you never use it, it's a bit of a joke, I mean it actually fits into American bit dunnit?
Ah yeah, it's Americanified, yeah, course it, well you can make co you could make cocktails
Oh I know you could, yeah.
without no messing couldn't you?
Not expensive ones either.
Mm.
Yeah, could have one of these.
Manhattan Transfers are nice though.
That, I remembered what they call that place at Whitecross, they call Damn Yankee.
I'm going to erm
Whitecross?
At  Guiseley.
Oh!
I'm gonna, next door to our Ramsden's Fish and Chip shop.
Oh, oh is it?
Well what I'm gonna do is, I'm go 
He's opened one in London at Heathrow Airport.
Yeah.
There's one in Blackpool now.
Is there?
They used to be absolutely beautiful there but they're crap now!
Well that's 
or whatever it is.
That's the problem innit?
I mean, one,yo yo be you get good because of the reputation of doing something and, and the one person 
And, and one person doing it, yeah.
doing it and then  because you're good everybody comes and  you cease to do it, you're upstairs doing the books instead 
Mm.
No, not me 
and you employ staff.
sunshine!
I 
Ah 
don't do books.
No, but you know what I mean, I mean you get 
Rob does the books.
pulled away from the 
Mm.
actual
Yes.
what you're good at
Yes.
onto other staff.
And it's very difficult to get other people to do it like you want it.
Oh yeah.
That's right.
So if we got erm  yeah, so, yeah that I'll, I'll erm  I'll get Brenda to go get me a rec erm, a menu and send me it.
Cos more you get it's easier to
Is it?
Bloody hell it's cold!
I know.
Yeah.
Get in erm
Hugh do you know Anne?
Anne 
Yeah.
Hughey.
Yeah, we've met, we, we meet on a Friday night love don't we?
When there's only me in company that's sober.
Yeah, she comes, she comes up, yeah.
Yeah.
Wha what?
 
No, er  customers Friday, I didn't mean er
Yeah.
Anne's just saying we erm  ought to pull that whole sta dance floor out  and have it all flat floored.
Flat.
Yeah.
And you could then do something that's 
That's more American anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, I mean you can create a dance floor by the tables and just lighting round it.
I mean that's all it, as I say, I don't know why I didn't think of it cos in the she well I do know why I didn't think of 
Why don't we make that like a rebel fort?
That would be  that
Like the Alamo you mean?
Yeah.
The thing blows out of it?
Yeah.
Arrows stuck in it!
Are we erm
Oh no not at all.
No, that isn't what I, no, no, no 
No, no.
Yeah I know.
But as I say, if you took that out you create a massive empty space then.
Yeah, well i it makes it, it 
then you can 
makes it so that you can, you see the other thing  what's your name?
Hughey again?
Hugh, Hugh, yeah.
Oh right.
Well we were just thinking about functions you see
Yeah.
well as it is now you, you know, you really don't wanna be half of them up there and half of them down here  on a table.
And you could get so many in  on the thing.
I think you have, I, I sort of.
And then just  lino the whole floor.
Cos, well the floor can be a disco anyway, like, you know.
It's not a disco, disco, you know what I mean?
You know 
No.
No.
No.
No.
I mean lin 
Yeah, something 
I me 
nearly
for the sake of, for the sake of a few bands that we do, I mean most of the bands on the local level  are used to playing in pubs so they just had to play on the floor anyway  and the rest of it
Well it's a bloody ego who needs the stage .
And any, any major names you could always, if you need, if it was that big yo and important 
They'd be at the  wouldn't they?
No, but
Well that'd be 
No but I mean you could get a  a stage in 
Pull a stage in.
stage in from across the er  across the way.
Just  temporary 
Yeah.
staging that's put in and cast away.
Well where do you find that?
That break and special  tie it at the back of there?
Yeah.
Doesn't make sense but oh I dunno.
I know !
I dunno you can't see his head 
 
my little sweetie pie!
The horrible little  int there?
 
Well, you know, once he, once he's  once he's resigned himself to not getting this  back.
Is there no chance of it?
What, of him getting this back?
No.
Not now,no not 
Pigs can fly can they!
now, not Elliel.
Da I mean once he sort of re I mean that's why all the fuss with Jean stopped because that 
Yeah, but a thing like 
Was it?
that is, it's just that Mr  who really didn't know anything from his  and needle and thread was stirring the shit!
  

No, she's been getting enough of that.
But once he's, once he's resigned himself to that, he's then gotta look at that operation next door and he must be losing money hand over fist for the amount of space it is.
That's right.
He  to take out all these walls out, right the way back
And is it just
and it's as big as this.
And you've got 
Back to that wall 
Mhm.
Mm.
I mean it's a co it's almost a bloody conference centre to be honest!
Mind you, though 
You could, you could seat  if you did, sort of classroom seating in there  a, room this size in that, er, you could, you could probably seat six hundred people.
Not as many as the Dome.
Even, at six hundred.
Not a quarter.
Yeah.
I mean  it's a Dome and a bit.
I told Angie today that we're gonna extend.
Oh did you?
Yeah.
He said he could do them himself because  I'm not having .
They were gonna charge erm 
Mention it.
Oh.
Well be fucking .
Yeah, well, the tro he sa 
Lights.
It's the lighting isn't it?
So erm
  

Mm.
Need to get a whole batch of these  ti 
Mm?
we need to get a whole batch of these tiles get them all sorted out.
Who?
These tiles.
Yeah?
Cos they're
That's what  
multi 
deaf in it
Oh are you?
Yeah I am actually.
Ha 
Hi 
I can't hear you, I can't hear  men usually.
 
It's only, it's only screaming women I can hear!
Well we er 
No but it's really embarrassing sometimes cos I, I have to look at men cos 
Yeah.
when they're talking som I'm sure they think I'm bloody crazy!
And read their lips.
And that I'm in love with him or something !
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I can't understand that!
 
No just
Erm, no we need, we need to get a whole load of ne er  tiles  cos the whole club wants re-tiling, not re-tiling but  there's a whole  area, areas and that.
And po and polystyrene 
And and, they're the wrong, you know, if you're gonna, if you're gonna redecorate the whole thing you need to erm  you need to, you know.
Yeah.
Well yeah 
You don't need
No, what I said.
three diff four different kinds of blue in the roof and things like that.
Well not really.
They're awful things to paint aren't they?
A do you do them rounds or what,spra can't you spray them?
Hughey does them, I don't know.
How do you do them?
How do you do them?
Just stick the brush on them.
You have 
Right.
to work with what you've got.
Well that's true.
 
A man's only as good as the 
Yes I know.
tools he's given.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I quite like that idea with them all like that.
What?
Yes, definitely.
I think the punters would appreciate it as well.
Yeah.
Hello!
Yeah.
No, not yet, yeah.
Okay.
Oh right.
That's right.
Yes it is, three thirty.
Okay.
It's just a matter of er,i I mean  all we need to do is, is, is sort out a sort of  formal agreement with  Elliel  that, you know, and how, how  the management company or the limited company's going to  sort of manage the place and th then we'll er  got to, you know, we've got two people  who've got a, a very successful business  they're actually drinks' suppliers, Morecambe Bay Wines and Spirits  er, who are gonna come in and have er  they'll sign the cheque for the rent there and then, I mean  it's er  it's a matter of just  th you know, all it is is, is they're saying well, you know  what actually is the formal arrangement?
And we're sort of saying, we haven't actually got round to  formalizing it yet.
Er  Mm.
Right.
Right.
Yes.
Yeah.
Erm  er, well Jean's got the exact figures, er, she's, she's done it all, she's got it all, all down for, for, for this afternoon.
Erm, I don't know, I've written it down.
And th on the cherish you and whatever else and th erm, I mean we've already got a situation where we've got erm  through Peter and David, the other two, I mean we've got erm  erm  two or three breweries who are quite willing to erm  to  give us  quite a substantial amount of money  not as loans, as write-offs against barrelage  erm  which means that we don't have any repayments to make etcetera.
So they're effectively  sort of  grants and ye in, in that way.
Erm  mm, no, you just play it,yo well, you he yes and no, I mean i er  you, you, you were ge you were getting in pra i the equivalent of thirty pound a barrel discount  erm, which is probably as much as you could  er could get, er in, in  in a free  free house any, er except that you've got, you know, fifteen, twenty thousand pounds up front as a payment to you.
Erm  the company is  Morecambe Bay Wines and Spirits.
Erm  and this is going to sound stupid but I don't know their second names.
Peter and David are the two  erm  they're up to yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Erm  it's just  to two of them and er 
Well that, but your main areas will be  gonna be before.
So 
What?
we're just saying main area's  
You ought to save them wooden type of things for it.
You know the
Yeah.
Yeah.
Should have bought them for .
Ve er, yeah, I mean it's, it's 
Are they expensive though?
expensive, it is very expensive.
Well you could have your dance floor, actual dance floor  whatever, couldn't you?
And then something
Mm.
Well it's 
You can make it different like and make it sort of still a dance area.
Yeah.
Something like they have at Chapel .
Yeah, what have they got down in there?
Just the wooden floor.
It's just, just a little, a little sort of parquet 
Small 
flooring type of thing.
Oh!
That type of floor, yeah.
And carpet all round it and just a
Oh it's carpet is it round 
Yeah.
it?
But it's only a tiny  area 
Yeah but 
isn't it?
Yeah.
But as I say, in the Sugar House so we I mean, we've ju we, all we did was, was we  the mass the big central area we just  literally  sort of lino type floor  and carpeted  round the edges 
Round the edge.
and into the bar area.
And it's a ma I mean you get four hundred people on the dance floor in the Sugar House.
Erm
Where is this Sugar House?
It's in erm
In Lancaster?
behind Waring and Gillow.
How do you get to that?
Say the rest of us didn't know where it was.
Up, up the alleyway by  the Yorkshire, you got Yorkshire House there
Ah!
Yes.
Waring and Gillow, and it's up that alleyway there.

You used to go in to play snooker didn't you?
I did.
Disco nights.
When we have a  when we were talking to them and we had the door through  and my snooker got really good.
Mm.
We did, we had a snooker table at home and my snooker will never get good.

Bastards stealing our customers last night!

Criticizing a  scooterist 
Where's my customers?
Criticizing a  scooterist don't want them in town and then put functions on and cheap beer for them  when they come.
Well they do that don't they?
I mean, they're all  you know.
Supposed to be four hundred in the Ranch House last night.
On the ground like.
We need lo we needs lots of  piles of steaming horse manure and things don't we around and 
 
stuff like that?
Gotta get it right.
No!
That's for Frontier Land.
We are

Thought it was hardly .
We're Boston.
Yeah definite .
That's right.
We're near Boston.
Yeah.
Cheers.
Yeah.
Yeah!
No.
Why?
Does it
Punters wouldn't go, go for it.
No.
No I don't, no, no, no, no, no, but I know it wants to be  erm
Eh!
Have you seen the new rules on er  bar staff?
No.
They're not allowed to smoke.
Oh yeah.
No, you're not.
No, no, no.
No.
Full stop?
Anywhere.
Yeah.
Not, you can't even wander outside 
So I go doo doo doo doo doo.
That's right.
And, you've gotta wear gloves  to use the till.
You what?
You can't ha you can't handle money  and
And serve  
pull pints.
Who says that?
This is Health and Environment, it's a new   
When's it in operation.
Er er, I don't know actually.
I've got it in Disco Club Mirror, it's the front page out the 
Oh I couldn't have that!
Grantham .
They're treating ba 
Got to have a look at this.
they're treating alcohol as food.
Yeah.
So all the hygiene things on food  apply to alcohol.
Oh I know that.
So you can't handle, you can't handle 
You're gonna have to have somebody else to take the money won't you?
Fucking cashier.
You'll have to have a cashier.
.
You can't do it though.
You can't have,yo it'd mean one to serve and one take the money.
It's fucking ridiculous!
Say if you're, if you're really busy at the bar just taking your gloves off and fucking  putting them on.
Oh aye you're gonna do it aren't you!
Well what we'll do is we'll do, we'll just have a pump at the side of the till.
Well you   
There's punters on the door !
Yeah, you know like
Fucking  !
you know like it is.
Oh no it isn't!
You wanna go  !
 
 
Alright then.
Or nuclear license opens  
 
No, just ask them if it's effective with your license just, you know, sort of as you come 
Mind you, one 
from the sale.
Vo Volks  Volks took them 
We're sterilizing the bar with those.
Volks took them into, not Volks, er what they called?
Somebody took me to see one of their pubs in Liverpool it was wonderful!
Where the shutters are
Yeah.
all, just hardboard  like that, with just a little  O like that and you, you, you shout a pint of beer and you pushed your money through and then a beer  ca came out the other side !
Bet it was  erm 
It was rough!
Yeah !
Waste of time though innit?
It was a bit of a rough area.
What type of beer are you getting!
No, and a pint of sherry!
Yeah, and plastic glasses as well.
Yeah !
Oh my
Great!
I mean, the only way you could do that would be  if you had a till at one end and people bought whatever they wanted and were given a voucher and you walked down the other end and exchanged 
Mm.
it for drink.
That's the only way you could actually  make that work at all.
Yeah, but just think of how much messing about there is.
Ah!
It'd be unbelievable!
I mean it'd be two thi forty we'd be round the bloody bend!
Yeah, but it's somebody sitting in an office innit  deciding this!
Yeah, but who, who do you  you know why 
Sitting in a suit in a nice office saying, wo!
This is a good idea.
You know  they don't serve behind the bar on a Saturday night.
They want somebody here from the  for half an hour and them not being served first 
Here!
You know what happens, d'ya know what happens then they'll get people 
like.
Yeah.
People will get so antiseptic that they'll not be able to stand any  sort of germs of any sort.
That's 
Yeah.
true that!
I mean, you think about all this  I mean  a load of crap when they have larders and all that!
Alright, you might have got the odd  but it's all this warming, doing it and then  half leaving it and then 
Yeah.
warming it up again that does the damage.
Certainly does.
Mm.
So  well I shall wander back with my little book now.
I'm er  I'm er, I'm just er
What?
Right.
I shall come tomorrow tonight when it's dark.
Right.

Can't see a thing.
And you won't be able to see anything.
I know I come on a Friday I were absolutely gobsmacked!
Yeah.
You can only see twelve feet er, you'd think the place was empty  in the bar.
Erm  I mean Saturday night would be be better Anne.
Oh Saturday night then.
Yeah, well I'll have a wander in Saturday night then.
But is that  is that 
Yeah.
Oh.
This is definite.
Bye!
Bye.
You know that I'm not gonna get out of course.
Gotta climb up that other end.
There's another  there's a orifice down there.
Right.
Why are the doors always  wrote wrong way!
I know.
I know.
That's er, that's our
That's ours just there, yeah.
Yeah.
That's ours as well there.
Oh sorry .
That's ours as well down there.
You get enough for twenty five K hav haven't they?
And that's with the  chip system obviously.
Yeah.
It's er  cleaner's room, two dressing rooms and toilets down there.
Well this is the area that you'll have to do something about is the  if you're gonna knock it into the Winter Gardens this is the area that knocks into the Winter Gardens.
Oh!
Does that lead
Well, along that corridor is
Well I, we won't be doing anything nearly spectacular area than this.
It won't open.
Mm.
Where are all the light switches?
I mean, what, what we initially, this was a cloakroom  this, this area 
Yeah.
wasn't here,i this 
Mm.
was the door and there was a little cloakroom
Yeah.
but er, our customers  don't take their jackets off anyway
Oh right.
Don't they?
Erm 
So you don't need a cloakroom then?
No.
But more in, but  what it was we when I was in here, sort of five days a week, nine to five job
Mhm mm.
it was getting depres it was getting oppressive in that little office down there.
Oh!
I would have thought, yeah.
Awful!
You'd get a 
So we were gonna move an office up to here with some natural light in it.
Yeah.
Cos there's nothing worse than there being a room with no natural light in, really.
I didn't realize it at the time but I think it wants 
Eh!
No they think it's really bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So
It's really bad  not enough light.
It's oppressive.
Right.
Course, the other thing you've gotta invest in is tables and  well you don't need chairs, but tables, I mean  as you can see we've got two hundred of those poly-cotton chairs  in there which is  erm  can be used.
I'll get some tables up with erm
Mm.
Tables are quite expensive though.
So many places Barry are going down
Well, true 
I tell you.
Yeah.
Just keep, just, in fact just keep  well le let's get it sorted out and then we'll just get er  er  cos plenty of storage space and stuff.
Mm.
Used to have tables and extensions you see
Mm.
Bob makes tables.
Bloody hell!
I've got extensions, sure.
I tell you what make i trestle tables are so expensive aren't they?
I know!
Incredible price!
You still .
You can't, you can't get either, you know, proper 
No.
you know, big wooden 
I know.
trestle tables you just can't get anywhere.
No.
There's another  wasted area.
There's incredible wasted areas in this place!
It's very badly planned you know
Terrible innit?
inside here.
It's all corridor and er
Mm.
It's all foyers and things.
Wants to be like  Chamber of Horrors!
As you come down, you know.
Right!
Alright.
I'm off!
Speak to you later.
Right.
Cheers.

Brewing up, no?
No.
The erm  you know that bottle of bleach in the cellar  was it bleach?
Yeah.
Didn't smell very strong  the top's been off it.
The top's been, yeah.
I just brought it up with some er, just in case cos we don't, we don't really wanna use that for like these.
Not really.
Er  I've taken  all the rubbish down except for that long box in 
Do we wanna get any more of the empty cases out today?
Yeah.
About forty quid's worth of empty cases.
Cor!
It's amazing what they're doing with them.
Yeah.
I know.
Have you been to put a bet on?
Yeah.
How did you know?
I guessed.
What on one race or

Elliel, yeah.
Half past three.
Has Jean got to be here?
Yeah.
She said sh sh sh she said she'd be here about half two.
She's been to a funeral   
Who's dead?
I don't know.
Some, somebody on the County Council.
He's probably been dead for about two years, they haven't noticed!
In that case, if this Thursday ge get anything like the other Thursdays we've got enough to last.
Is there a book for that like?
Er  Webb, Webb missed the first one  blasted it over the top  and Giggs missed one at the end.
They scored all theirs and Giggs had to score his
Oh yeah.
to make them  
So that they could miss the last one?
Yeah.
I mean
Fucking awful!
This fucking stuff they put down.
Well, yeah, but it's the police's fault innit?
Yeah.
You know, I mean it  it's bloody outrageous that the police can dictate  you know, something F A Cup's been there for 
I know.
Bastards!
hundreds of years and  police can dictate the  what you're gonna do.
Don't be silly!
Yeah.
May as well.
So they're a bit sticky.
Nearly broke my neck on one, pulling one, one of those crates out.
Pulling this?
Yeah !
Yeah, they'll be fucking .
Oh, actually you can smell the bleach now can't you?
Yeah.
Are you gonna do them all?
Yeah.
May as well.
Fucking no more cos they'll all be here for four o'clock.
Probably forgotten pi the line cleaners.
I did write it down for her in the list.
All this thing in the press and on the T V about Kevin Keagan being a folk hero in Newcastle, He 
I know!
How 
He 
long did he play for them?
he only played there two years!
Yeah.
Two seasons.
Two seasons.
I mean, I can't believe that he's  I mean 
Fuck!
Ossie's had a hard game like, Swindon 
Oh yeah.
being promoted and then
I know.
somebody taking the fucking 
That's awful!
points off them.
What have they  th they ducked three points as it is.
No, they've put them down in third division now.
Yeah, originally they'd have ducked for three 
Yeah, Yeah.
points and 
Yeah.
stopped, and then  prefer to go like when they appealed because he'd  knocked them again.
I mean, you know, how long's he, when did he get the job, May or something, last year?
I mean he's hardly  you know, he's had 
Yeah.
half a season, I mean  that's ridiculous!
And then the vote of confidence, he'll be there.
Oh God!
How the fuck can he do that?
I know.
Every time they do it , don't they, you know?
I know.
Yeah.
He er  especially when the chairman says he's got every faith in him.
 
You know you're gonna a er a telegram the next morning.
Outrageous that!
I wondered when they offered Keagan to do it?
Yeah.
I fucking watched the programme on that  Who Who's the Greatest?
It was about fucking sportsmen of the week, and it was Keagan and George Best.
Oh I, I remember that, I didn't watch it, I refused to watch it.
I mean that's actually going in for Keagan!
I think fucking Dennis Taylor was on  singing his praises.
Singing whose, Keagan's praises?
Yeah.
I think it was Dennis Taylor, Taylor.
That's a  that was difference yo you end up voting, you end up actually voting who's the nicest human being, not 
Yeah.
really 
Exactly.
That's why it was,cos he's 
not the best footballer.
you know, dedicated to his club and all this 
Yeah.
stuff.
But I mean, he, he wasn't 
He's a  
particularly was he?
I mean, he went to Liverpool, Liverpool made him 
That's right.
Yeah.
from Scunthorpe  and then, I mean, he, he went after mega bucks in, in erm
Hamburg.
Hamburg, then  you know,so being a big fish in a small pond at Southampton  and then 
But 
last couple of years a quick  I mean, his contract with Newcastle worth, worth a fortune wasn't it?
Cos it was one of those first ones that was sponsored by
Who was 
the 
it?
the brewery 
Was it 
wasn't it?
was it Pools?
No.
It was er, erm  wasn't it Newcey brown ale  went and sponsored Newcastle?
No, no.
But anyway, I mean, they er they ended up, instead of paying the club a sponsorship they ended up paying him, you know, like erm 
Yeah.
like the car phone company did with 
Yeah.
Ian Botham to go to Worcestershire.
But he wasn't the fucking greatest, oh hardworking I'd say, he fucking 
Oh yeah.
grafted.
Yeah.
That's right.
He wasn't a 
He wasn't that .
he wasn't a very skilful player.
No.
He wasn't a natural at all.
He worked hard though.
Yeah.
He had a, he had a, he had a, a lot, he had a  he was quite nippy  and he had a good scu you know, good goal 
Good goals.
scoring sense 
Yeah.
sometimes, but I mean  that was all.
He was a good player but  I  but I think he's always looked after himself, I mean he's  he's 
Yeah.
he's probably one of 
Oh yeah.
the richest British footballers.
He will be.
Yeah.
I can't think anybody would have more.
No.
No.
I mean it, it  no, he was one of the first with the shrewd sort of business sense 
Yeah.
and all that.
Fucking Mick  's making a fortune training at Arsenal!
Is he?
Doing really well yeah.
And Francis , he's doing quite 
Yeah.
well.
Didn't he used to be in scrap metal is what Francis was 
Toilet rolls.
telling me?
Is it?
Oh.
Did you see erm  This Is Your Life last night?
No.
It was Alan Bleasdale.
Oh!
The 
Ah

Yeah.
And they had, they had er  Kenny Dalgleish and Graham Souness, and er 
All the Liverpool, like?
Yeah.
And they had er  tt  erm  Reed
Peter Reed?
Yeah.
Cos he used to  Alan Bleasdale used to be Peter Reed's teacher at school and the 
Did he?
Yeah.
A and erm  he, he coached the football te 
He would be bunking off!
he coached the football team the, the 
What place is that then?
the Kirby Boys and they won the national competition or something or other with the, with them.
No,th the till man said we have to keep erm  you know the receipt one
Yeah, but we never put that on do we?
I know.
But we need to keep er a, a receipt in it.
Because
And just have it so it's not
Yeah.
Yeah.
So th there's a switch inside on, off.
Yes, yes, I know that.
He said fa because erm  one of the keys is damaged erm  the bot you know when the, you know the printout
Yeah.
when it prints out  the bottom  of like the noughts and, the bottom of the figure is missing, you can read it, it's not important, but it's done because the one, it wo it's punching onto, onto metal  because that paper's not on our till receipt.
See that thing you had whe when the bar was taken this time was that  just for tax like
No that was, that was our er  that was our accounts for the year.
Does Volks actually know that, yeah?
Yeah.
I think Volks just wanted out of the area to be honest.
Yeah well 
Don't care.
they're further  further up north aren't they now?
Mm.
Well they've got the depot at Rochdale which services up to Blackpool  and this was out on a limb.
Yeah.
Cos,i it  Kendal's done from Newcastle.
Is it?
Yeah.
Up to there 
Oh course!
Yeah.
and then  Rochdale up towards Blackpool and we're stuck right in the bloody middle so the er, they were a, like we were one delivery that's all it, and we weren't that big an account, you know even doing  a reasonable trade you're not 
Yeah.
for one pub.
Yeah, well they, they, you obviously need two, three that like, to make it worth your while.
Yeah.
It's getting a bit fucking rank you know!
Now d'ya know  how dirty those shelves get?
Mind you, the cra crates are fairly dirty aren't they  at times.
Yeah.
That's what does it.
On the bottoms as well.
Yeah, you sometimes get them  some of them look as if there's, I dunno  vinta vintage Newcastle Brown you know  cobwebs and dust on them int there and  spiders' webs on them.
I hope Saturday's as good as last Saturday it was quite a good night that.
Well I, I, I, I honestly thought the bar should have done , and I'm sure it fucking did you know.
Didn't have enough people in  to do anything else.
I dunno.
We'd have had, they'd have had to spent about five quid a head.
Yeah but they were.
Like the shorts were absolutely hammered!
Like there were them lads   they had fucking four in a glass like and, there was loads of, so many drinks like  I served loads.
Vod vodka  Jack Daniels and  some other spirit in it.
I ju I just wanna know how much Terri took, you know .
Yeah.
I'll have a look.
Like, erm, I'm, like I'm not fucking saying to she's, she's  but she's, she just gets fucking absolutely stupid!
It's really silly like.
Like, and you know that, is it Alis Alison and  somebody?
She's always on about Alison like, I'm sure she fucking doesn't charge them for drinks.
Well, which one's Alison?
She's er, she always comes looking for Terri.
She's going with that little monster with the long hair.
Played in the band here once and they 
Aha.
were crap or something.
Kevin er, Kevin I think his name is.
She's just though, she's  fucking outrageous !
She doesn't know what she's doing half the time!
Like you go, even saying I did serve quite a bit faster than her, which I do like, you know she still should o i if the bar done seven fifty she should have, she should have done what  two, three and a half?
Oh yeah.
At least, like.
Well she, I mean, she might have done it.
She should have done a bit more than that actually.
Mm.
She should have been doing three hundred.
Still leaves me a hundred and fifty ahead of her like, you know.
Like, you didn't serve any drinks did you Barry?
No.
No.
Er 
So all
twenty, twenty quid's worth maybe at the end.
Not much.
If it's gonna be like that we do need a glass collector don't we?
We need somebody on to collect glasses.
But er, there wasn't really any  even though it was quite, we, we, we did have quite a lot of glasses.
Mind you, they would have gone and broke if we line them up.
Yeah, but Ka Katrin wasn't, Katrin wasn't.
She'd got no, oh that's right, yeah.
You know
Well that's another thing, I think that black man as well is getting drinks as well.
Mind you, you wouldn't mind, you'd give him a couple like, if you 
Yeah.
help us, you 
No.
know like.
Well that's right, I mean, you know, two or, two or three drinks to us is only costing like a quid, well it's only a quid.
Yeah, but she's been caught doing it as well.
Ach!
It's not the point, Jean put o said to me last week about the fucking .
Like, and there's other people in there that are  you know, they should be wrote down, and she looked at me 
Yeah.
like.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I mean, they're gonna have to be from now on cos we're not gonna be, you know, we're gonna be  responsible to 
Yeah.
somebody else, not just ourselves, you know.
Okay, if we wa if we want to turn a blind eye to it then that's our business you know  but er  but when you're, when you're actually erm 
Answerable to someone else.
Yeah.
Present accounts to somebody else you can't do it like that can you?
You know water's looking disgusting!
What other results were there last night?
Er  Forest 
The 
won four two.
Oh did they?
Doing really well.
.Liverpool drew one each with Bristol Rovers.
That don't sound right.
I've seen it, seen that one  I've seen that match  they were lucky.
Sunderland  won, who were they playing?
Sunderland won.
Er  Oxford I think.
They were winning three nil  three two at the end of it.
Oxford scored one on the end  
Not many first division teams left is there?
Nine.
About  nine is there?
Wrexham were unlucky against Blackburn.
Oh!
Weren't they?
Didn't they play well?
Yes!
They've always been a 
I thought they played 
good club side  Wrexham.
Yeah, they have but I mean, they got a lot of good skilful young lads haven't they?
They're only like nineteen and twenty 
Yeah.
and  I mean that young fullback looked brilliant!
That lef 
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Quite good.
Composed as well like.
Talented.
Yeah.
It's a funny law that er  clear chance at goal job innit?
I mean it's a  funny definition.
I must admit I, I  if you could stop that deliberate foul it's  I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it.
Send them off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean if you're gonna do it 
Yeah.
do it, do it, do it 
Yeah.
consistently.
Cos, actually, the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that, you know, how many times when a forward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score?
It's not that often actually.
No.
I mean, okay, somebody like Besty 
Thing you want 
you could bet on
Yeah.
nine times out of ten, but 
But even, even against the goalkeeper they fucking lose fifty percent of the, like 
Yeah.
I was saying  more than fifty percent of the playing 
Yeah, I would, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's all just  one on one on the goalkeeper.
Yeah.
Well that's what I mean, I mean, you know,th th the player could let him, could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because  it's, it's gonna 
Half the 
be at least a fifty fifty
Yeah.
chance that the goalkeeper's gonna save it innit?
It's fucking gotta be straight like that, I, I, I don't fucking  taking off three points for a   .
At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it, they've just become too hectic now I think.
Mm.
You know, there's not as much skill involved as there was.
No.
No, that's right.
It's
Like the
incredibly passed.
the first, the first season like the football did seem to improve but it's not
That's right.
gonna go back now I think.
United have got a strange side at the moment though 
Oh yes.
I mean I don't think you can  it's alright having all these players but if you  he doesn't seem 
They don't play.
he doesn't seem to 
They 
have an idea of what he wants.
Cos I mean 
No they don't.
every week he's got a different sort of format.
Well what's he supposed to do?
Giggs, Semen .
Well he had him 
Well I think he's gotta look at, and the team should be in with you 
Yeah.
like.
He had him playing yesterday, er, but they dropped Hughes.
Yeah I know .
Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody!
And his two subs, Hughes and Sharp, I mean it does rather hamstring 
Yeah.
you if anything happens to a central defender dunnit?
Yeah.
Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like, he should be on the team.
Well that's right, even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and, and 
Yeah, he always done like.
Good in defence as well.
Yeah.
That's right.
Well he's also summat, er I mean he's, he's one of the best  at holding a ball  you know 
Fantastic shielding the ball 
on his own.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whitbreads are here.
Arsenal 
Yeah.
played well.
Yeah.
The crowd were getting at them last night.
Were they?
The first goal was dreadful!
My  did you see it?
They were winning three nil weren't they?
Yeah.
 
Did you see this goal?
No.
I remember seeing, but I heard fucking result on News at Ten.
It was a long 
I know.
it was a  it was full pass inside to two fullbacks  er, for the  Southampton player that was running on  this fullback shaded it away  you know, guiding him out of it, he's running to the e sa Smeichel came out to the edge of the area  but he was like right on the edge  as the player was coming to him, so he just let it roll a little bit further, he stopped it with his foot, the guy came and tackled him off  got it  instead of just picking it up with his hand, I mean he was actually in the area but like  he was right on the edge and he took a step back 
Why the fuck didn't he 
and stopped it with his foot.
Yeah.
wait for the ball coming in?
I tell you Liverpool were really lucky cos er  Bristol Rovers had got a penalty.
Mm.
As long they, as long as they win the league I do I don't mind.
Been a long time.
Mind you 
I know.
Leeds are still  bloody doing well though.
They won three nil last week didn't they?
Yeah.
Oh every week they  putting it together, scoring the goals.
I think they were about a hundred and fifty to one I'm standing see if they can win the league.
Are they?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be a bad that actually, cos if it did
Yeah, they played well the year before they held their own see they've got all the 
They played last year didn't they?

Wallace  not a bad buy.
Arsenal are playing terrible aren't they?
Mm.
