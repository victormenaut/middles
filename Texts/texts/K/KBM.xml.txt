Just pay your money  and you put it in the tray 
It's just you believe in baptizing
Were you baptized?
No
That makes sense
Baptize you   why not?
Why weren't you baptized?
You make such a decision you make when you, when
The decision you make when you 
Yeah 
Right aargh
you don't christened at a baptist church
Of course you can get baptized when ya, er at any age can't ya?
It's not baptizing, christening is different
You can get baptized any time can't ya?
Yeah
when you're baptized 
it's your own decision
when you're baptized it's like a pool of water 
Three or four of us start, er three or four of us talking yesterday, day before yesterday, erm, about  the attitude generally of erm students in the, the sixth form, years twelve and thirteen, and 
 
and erm, it struck us that erm possibly in this year's lower sixth erm there, there are one or two people, boys and er lads and girls, erm who are not aware 
Boys and lads and girls 
of what sixth form courses entails, now, erm, three or four of us thought it might be worth our while, or your while if you just briefly said what I'm going to say now, that erm, the, the 
It's a bit vague innit?
work you do up to G C S E is very difficult, that it should be very different from erm, when you're in the sixth form
Why?
Because until G C S E you are fed, the school is fed, in that you are told fairly quickly what you have to do and although I know that a number of you spends the right amount of time or a lot of time on homework, you are told usually, er you have erm a night or two nights in which to do this particular piece of work  now once you get into the sixth form 
I can tell I'm not gonna like this 
you are given very much more freedom or independence would be a better word, and erm 
Shit 
you'd be expected to, to do a lot of work by yourself, and that's reflecting the fact that erm you'll probably have four or five lessons in each of your three subjects, but most people would choose three subjects for A level, and that means that er, when you're not having lessons, you've got a lot of time that is not accountable for, you will have been, or going to a general studies period and stuff like that, but there will be a fair number of private study periods, erm, there are some people I think who, who go overboard, and you've got such a different approach erm from er the lower sixth, people don't use the time that they have, erm, what I'm really saying is that if you go into the sixth form  and you spend less school time in the sixth form you don't need to be prepared 
Well what's  
to, to make wise use of your non-teaching 
 
time, erm presumably going into a library quite a lot.
You would also be expected to for example to prepare for 
Eh I'm not going into a library, fuck that
for certain lessons, I just give you an example with literature it would work with erm science and er other things as well, you might be told in the next lesson we are going to discuss, for example the first act of a particular play, or we're going to discuss which particular scientific experiment or the cause of whatever it is 
 
you will be expected to have done some research, done some preparation before coming along to the lesson, if you go along to the lesson not having done that, you will be able to play back certain tips from what the other people say, but you will not er, you will find that  
 
anywhere near  as if you were prepared, because if you were prepared there are bound to be one or two things that you would want to ask for, own by the standard of interpretation of whatever it is, or a particular word if it's a language and so on, erm and that is something that er I think people erm come across as  
Oh yeah, sure 
and the other, the other, the other thing, I don't want to make this sound a lecture or anything like that, but the other thing is that erm erm you have 
You can stuff your lecture 
twenty one months in the sixth form, please don't think that everybody has two years, erm and those, those 
Oh okay 
short two years may make a big difference at this stage now, erm
 
A levels  only happen when the most, a month, more from school and then they have study leave as you are, now erm  when you consider the, the year since September has gone very, very quickly, those who have done very little work in that first year, year twelve, will find that  been packed in there and that first year in the sixth is just like your year ten ought to have been, perhaps, one or two of you are are realizing 
Oh oh 
that you could have done a bit more last year
That's likely
and it's even more noticeable once you go into the, the year twelve, that first twelve months is crucial, if you just kick your heels and do nothing, you'll find it very very difficult to work to pull up  
Is he finished this?
Finished this?
but whichever work you study 
Yeah, all of it?
you know that is the, erm two or three things there, you're working by yourself in your, your personal preparation  prepa preparation are crucial parts, erm, if any of the people were thinking of going to erm, erm, a college, erm, the same sort of thing will arise and I suppose the big difference for  if you don't have lessons then I think I'm right in saying you don't necessarily have to go in, I don't know whether that still applies, erm, you would be expected of course to erm, erm, to turn up at school here, erm, now there are advantages and disadvantages, you may feel that you prefer, knowing on your own what you're like, you'll prefer erm some fairly rigid rules, erm, because if there weren't rules you might think you'd take advantage of us
You got rules here
erm, only that sort of rules, probably a big advantage I think of staying in er sixth form is that erm you know the staff, you know the system and it and they know you, erm if you go to  
A big problem man 
you will take you a matter of months of course for you to settle in, and those first few months are crucial, again, I maybe just mention this that you are aware of  okay so that's  
Okay, let's go 
eh?
What?
was a bit out of order   we have nothing to do with it  hmm 
What?
It was an accident
hair, leave the hair 
it was an accident

Oh alright shut up, don't spend, don't save any  you're going to be in a mess in the summer when you want, want lots of money to spend 
Why I'm gonna want some money to spend on?

Has he bothered last year?
Oh I suppose he could, we'll see
Will, will, will, will we still go?

Well do you want to?
Oh, I mean we wanted to go in May but we can't  we can may apart from the fact it'll be half tricky, we'll be more busy, I don't like it when it's busy 
Not at all, in the middle of bloody June there'll be no one there 
It'll be the end of June before you finish, twenty what?
Yeah, end of June yeah, well, no one else is off then
What, there be no kids off granted, but other countries go, we'll see  start looking round the beginning of June if your dad wants to go, there was, I just noticed this morning coming passed the erm, I think it was the Co-op or the one next door, a week in Ibiza, twenty sixth of April, self catering, a hundred and twenty four pounds, that's the day you go, that's the week you go back to school, you
I don't want to go to Ibiza again
No, no, but I said the 
it's such a touristy place, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go to a touristy 
Everywhere's a touristy place 
place.
Well I can go without you
Not having that, will we still go if dad don't wanna go?
Oh I don't know I suppose
Please
Maybe
just me and you
We'll see
Great
No
Why?
I don't understand why not  that's not fair then, that's erm, that's taking four people and not giving back, that's ungrateful
That's right then
Why not?
I'll see, no


Anyway she's no money
I know, well she couldn't anyway, but I mean why not?
There's no, it doesn't matter why if she can't
No, go on, I want the reason, she might be able to if her mum and dad pay for her  go on
I don't know, I'm not taking responsibility for you both
Why?
don't er, have to share one room perhaps, she might not like it
Share a one room with who?
All of us, if we got er one room 
Oh 
like we did in Ibiza there was only one room 
oh a stu a studio 
Mm, some of, a lot of them are like that
Well you don't have to have a studio, you have a choice when you book it
Yeah, but they're more money aren't they?
No 
That was only meant for three, you couldn't have got four in it
not that bad for four
Well where would of the other bed have gone?
Stand the other side, move, would of moved those drawers and stuff on there I think
My God
you know, you don't the apartments for three, you don't travel in threes 
Yeah, just couple and one kid 
So she can't?
No 
That's not fair,is it?
No, but, but 
Oh Chris will you please 
but you didn't, you won't take
shut up about it
responsibility for her before she's sixteen, take responsibility for ourselves
Then you can go on your own
Oh you, you wouldn't let me would you, you would 
Yeah, get yourself a job, get yourself a job
you wouldn't let me go on me own
If you were paying for it I couldn't stop you now you're sixteen
You'd just give us dirty looks probably wouldn't go
Mm, go and get yourself a job and go
So you wouldn't mind?
You got 
I can't stop you now you're sixteen
you've gotta be eighteen before you  you stop me doing other things
Such as?
Oh don't start that one again, I'm bored with that
Can, can I stay with 
I'll see, but I'm not promising Chris, it also depends what your dad says 
He's never here anyway, it don't matter
No we've got a separate, spare room
When's dad coming back?
I don't know yet, I should think it'll be by the end of the month
Why he ask you?
He hasn't, got to wait for the things to come the, the bed and the car and er they haven't ordered a carpet yet
She, got to wait till they order a carpet?
Well there's no use moving in till they've got a lounge carpet cos if they go in they'd just have to move everything to get it in
Sodding hell  
they haven't got a bed anyway, we don't know when that's coming
Why?
They can't sleep on the floor can they?
They can if I can, hmm, er when's the bed going to get there?
We don't know
Well when, did they order it?
Mm
From where?
Oh one of those catalogues
That's a rip off isn't it?
No they're not, they got a  was it thirty percent discount, first 
Five 
time buyer or something
Oh thirty
I think it was thirty
How much was the bed?
Oh I think they said they were paying a hundred and ninety nine
Where they get all their money from?
They're not getting it, it's all on credit
Oh that's bad news innit?
Not if they can afford to pay it and they don't get too much, it's interest free credit on fridge freezer
Well I know, it's still bad news cos they've got their mortgage and everything
Well they're both working, they've got a good, good income every month now
How much?
I dunno, I think they should clear eleven hundred a month between them
No in years 
I don't know how much they're getting 
clear eleven what d'ya mean clear?
Well after you've had your tax and insurance taken off, that's how much they should have between them
What between them, that 
at the end of the month
that's only twelve thousand, thirteen thousand a year, that's crap, that's what Gerrard gets just on his own 
Oh it must be more then I don't know then 
it's double that innit?
Lesley gets more than Gerrard doesn't she?
She does now, she's got this new job
Oh, it's about twice that
what's Gerrard on ten thousand?
More than that, twelve innit?
Oh I don't think it's
Twelve, thirteen, yeah cos he used to be on ten at the old place and he gets about two thousand more 
Oh was then ten?
Oh yeah, well after you've taken tax and insurance back you see, you've lost about three hundred, three fifty
Yeah, under the Conservatives that, if you'd been under Labour you would of lost about four hundred  didn't think of that though did you, didn't think your own son
But they, the Conservatives are cutting down on the health service and everything else and the schools
So?
What are we going to do when there's no, no health service?
They're going to get rid of it you know eventually
No
They are
No they're, they'll still be 
that's the way it's going 
they'll still be a health service, but peo 
No 
but people who can afford to pay for it will be, will be made to at the time 
Well that just 
which I think is right, if you can afford to pay for it then you should be made, made to
But where do they draw the line at those who can afford to pay for it?
I don't know, that's up to them 
No so I draw the pay, a set amount each month and have peace of mind thank you very much
Aargh
even if I've never had to use it much
Never even paid national insurance in your life have you mum?
Your dad pays his share for me, comes out of his wages  if I paid, it's just extra on top of all that, if I was paying any
Well that, oh, it's no point in arguing
Why?
You ask me so I told ya  no point in arguing, you won't make a very good politician, shut up, sod off
Don't use that language
I can't win this argument so shut up
I shall bloody win
Pardon?
I shall bloody win
That's enough
Why shouldn't, why shouldn't we be made to pay for a health service?
Because it's, it's a service for everyone, as long as everybody gets the same  
The only good thing, the only good thing about La the only good thing about Labour is that they would have brought back student grants so if I ever, if I ever do go to university then I'll get lots of money.
And if Labour'd got in they'd of er, your dad said he'd er probably got a rise
Would he?
Mm, I think he 
Rubbish how much?
Don't know, Labour'd be more  give more to the public sector don't they than the Conservatives?
Why he got a rise by the
He might of done he said, he probably would of done in the la the unions would of put in a big one for  Mr Major wouldn't give one, still wouldn't have affected
do you care?
Aha, do you want him to have more money?
Half his share
So 
it, it what did he say?
More for him to lose 
did he say B T had gone up twenty P this morning?
this morning
I think he said twenty P
When'd he tell you that?
overnight, he came home at lunchtime
They went up ten overnight to about, to about 
Oh they've gone er 
to about what I paid for them
Well I think he said they've gone up twenty when he came home  I'm not sure
Yeah it has, see 
How many have you got, three hundred?
Three hundred and eighty
Did he say I pay twenty pounds?
So that's twenty P int it in a hundred?
What?
He said I've made twenty pounds overnight  so that's, yeah they've gone up twenty P each cos I've got a hundred
Make sense I suppose
so you've made sixty pounds overnight
No I've made eighty, nearly eighty
You had three hundred
Three hundred and eighty I just said 
Oh sorry 
We're on tape number eight
My goodness
What?
you've done some to get all that
it's got 
It's got 'em 
it's got a load of rubbish on five, six and seven, there's perhaps nothing on it, I've just left it running 
ah Chris, it doesn't matter as long as I get, I just this is   there's nothing on those tapes by the way 
Well she said she didn't expect you to use all of 'em didn't she?
Hello commoner, can we, can we interview with a
Yes
common, common
Don't
socialist?
No.
No?
No, you're so embarrassed about your socialist ideas, you, you don't, you don't them, feel people knowing that  socialist 
Oh look at that 
socialist person, what?
it tipped over
Er, you should always put meat, meat and things, things that are gonna drip at the bottom, never ever put 
That's not meat
never, never ever put meat at the top
I know you don't, they go on there
Are you sure?
Cos you get the sort of thing like things are dripping off and if you've got germs in them and you've had a bad
Well this fridge is either full or it's empty, there's no half measures ever, it's never just right
No, it's either empty or full of crap so in other words it's empty for me, all the time
Yes, well, you put in what you want  oh shit 
Oh sugar  you tell it mum, you tell it love
Nobody else will
No sad innit?
Tea's in there
Yes  
No
Why?
What?
You want ?
Yeah, but apart from that I don't touch it 
No
Why not?
You take all my money just talking
Shut up
Shut up
Can I?
No
Why?
I don't fancy it that's all
What?
You're just into ego trips, make himself 
What?
I'm not playing your game, stop saying what
Well am I a good son?
No.
Why not?
Yes I suppose so
Why?
what's a bad one anyway?
I dunno what's a good one?
I mean
No 
am I perfect?
you are not
No I think 
Christopher give over
think, think you are too mum, you, you could have a son who is taking drugs, who was doing all sorts of in crime and joyriding
Mm, mm
but no
Mo I've got you, Conservative
Yeah, miles better, for the good of the country they're not good for you, women shouldn't have the vote you know  women shouldn't get the vote, I think they should bring back, bring back just men having vote, women don't get a say as far as I'm concerned that's a good idea don't you think?
Oh we go to our place for, now women stage for 
stage, that's my, that's my whole life  it's my whole  I've had that erm, have my views, so why do you think I should vote Labour?
Er
Come on why?
because they'll put more into education and schools
Yeah and it'll take a 
and the health service
Yeah, but they haven't got enough money
Take it off the rich 
they haven't got enough money to do that.
well take it off the rich.
They have not, they have not got enough
Well they will do
they haven't, did you not read the article in the er Telegraph?
They said, they said 
Yeah, I'm sorry I don't need  
the actual, actually nine point four billion pounds behind 
Short 
short 
Mm 
yes because they, they fo forgot to take out the money which they could have, which erm, which would of come from privatization, which they had no intention of doing so they took that out.
Are you not for privatization?
Er ye yes, if it gives a better service at the end of the day
So you think it's better?
Yeah
Well why don't Labour then?
I just said because of the health service and schools
Well the health service could be privatized
and they're more likely to give more money to us
and why shouldn't the health service be privatized?
Because some people need a lot more treatment than others and it's something you cannot, you cannot forecast 
I know but the actual, the actual peo the actual people that have to pay for us, such it could be more that erm, the government would actually pay for it and then hospitals would erm fight for the, for the actual er thing
Yes, but what if they don't?
What if they don't want?
If they just make it totally private where everybody has to pay
I don't know they'd never do that, they'd never do that 
those poor unfortunate people, I don't know would they not?
No
That's a right step in the right direction, no
Do you not think British Rail would have, have
I've no idea, I'm sure it will now 
You do care 
no I don't care, why should I care ?
Don't know
Won't make any difference to my life  these are cold 
Why not, why didn't you vote Liberal Democrat?
Because I don't think they had a chance of getting in to vote 
What getting into our seat?
No, well, and to the country as a whole
What does it matter about the country, the seat is what's important
Well yes
did you actually find out about the figures for the seat?
No I didn't
If you found out 
but they come second 
if you found out then you might have found out that they weren't very far behind, so they could of caught up and they could of gained a seat and they could of gained a say in the government
Mm, mm
so it's not wasted at all 
No
is it?
No
Pathetic, pathetic
You asked
it's, you just, you just don't believe  and they went back up
I'm the same as everybody else who's got views
a Labour person
What's the difference?
a Labour person will never actually buy shares truly wouldn't 
Well I wouldn't, it's you and your dad who've bought the shares, I wouldn't
You did
I put, yes only because your dad wanted some yes, I wouldn't dream of it otherwise, I'd stick my money in the building society 
Why not?
you  just to save, we have a
You make a lot more money though
I haven't made it so far, look at me, I'm living in luxury I am, I've got lots of money to spend
Compared to other people maybe, yes mum  you're not grateful for what you've got
I haven't got much of anything yet
Compared to a lot of other people you've got a lot more
Yeah, well compared to a lot more I've got a lot less 
Yeah, well you don't look at it like that
Yeah, well that's the way you look at it 
you, you 
you're always going on about what you want 
you, you want to be the best and no one 
I don't want to be the best, I just want a reasonable amount
You've got a reasonable amount haven't ya?
I haven't, it depends what you, what way you look at it
You, nah, you've always got enough for what you want ain't ya?
No, have I heck, I haven't got enough money for a, really good clothes and shoes that I'd like
Why d'ya want really good clothes?
Why not?
Eh?
Why not?
Make you look good, look good 
Why shouldn't I have decent clothes and shoes?
really good clothes, what do you mean by really good clothes?
Expensive well reasonably expensive 
Talking about clothes from Next for women
No I wouldn't go there
Why not?
Marks and Spencers'll do me
Oh my God
instead of once every three months 
well you can have it 
I could have something every week 
you want something every week from Marks and Spencers, that is so sad, I 
Oh 
wouldn't go in Marks and Spencers if you'd pay me
You have to, you're getting some vouchers tonight 
Well last time you got some vouchers right you 
I can't buy myself anything, I've still got to pay for them
But you'll be able to buy yourself something still
Mm, but there's nothing I want now
Mm, I'm sure you'll find something in Marks and Spencers, I have heard about a new trick mum, how to con money out of Marks and Spencers
Yeah?
right, you go upstairs, pick up the most expensive article they've got and then you go downstairs to the customer relations department and say I bought this article yesterday and say, and, and I'm afraid 
But you haven't got a receipt though 
I'm afraid it doesn't fit  unfortunately I've lost the receipt but will you still change it?
And they say yes we will, our business teach teacher told us about that you see because it's been happening a lot, cos Marks and Spencers don't ask for a receipt you see, it actually happened, they used to take things from upstairs, bring them downstairs and said they bought it and got the money for it.
That's terrible
Clever   still  I can earn it
No you don't
Yeah I know but Marks and Spencers are a crap shop I don't care if they go out of business  they're a rip off anyway, they're so expensive, such crap clothes, they're so common, that's the word I've been looking for common, that's my word of the week I think  er common  common,does it not get to ya looking like everyone else?
I don't look like everyone else.
If you, if you wear Marks and Spencers clothes you'd look like everyone else 
No I wouldn't first perhaps 
you look like millions of other people
I would like more money for a few more things though
you got five hundred quid bonus, why don't you spend that?
Because you, you've just been going on about going abroad
Er, ee
that's why
are we gonna go?
Oh Chris don't start that again, I don't know yet 
Out, how much money have you got in the building society?
What's it got to do with you?
Go on how much?
Eight hundred
Mm  is that you've saved up this year?
Yes
Saved it well haven't you?
Yes, so say
I've only got six hundred and fifty, will you give me some?
No I won't
Oh I'm skint 
That's your problem
Don't you think I'm skint?
I will be skint if I give you all my money
Yeah, you'll feel better for it though
No I wouldn't
Tt you'll get 
Yeah
Eh?
Yeah
Why?
You're annoying me now
Why?
You're just being so
So, does that annoy you then?
Oh I'm freezing cold
Can't you 
Christopher I don't know and quite honestly I don't care at the moment 
You always bite me head off when I ask some sensitive questions 
I've got too many other things 
Why don't we go next week?
Too late now
No it's not
No
you've got a week
it won't be as warm as it is in the April 
Well perhaps if we will, we weren't to, if we went next week, we'd have two weeks earlier than last year won't we?
Or three
Three I think
Three weeks, yeah we'll go somewhere like that Greece or   you know if you ask me   er I know loads of people in this 
I know, where did they stay?
They went to Tenerife

Tenerife and Lanzarote are no good then?
Do they have good beach 
Where there is a pavement or foot path used, do not walk next to the curb with your back from the traffic, look both ways before you step into the road  where there is no foot path, walk on the right hand side of the road, it is safer to walk on the side facing on coming traffic, keep as close as possible to the side of the road, take care at right hand bends, keep one behind if that is possible, particularly line heavy traffic on flurry, do not allow children under age five at least out alone on the road, go with them, walk between them and the traffic and always keep tight hold of their hands, if you can't do this then use reigns as security, secure them firmly into the pushchair, do not let them run into the road, always wear or carry something bright or light or reflected within the dark of light, this is especially important, that all uses it  it's just the rules I suppose 
That's how  man 
crossing the road, I don't need, you won't get asked that one will ya?
well ya, well ya might, but you, you 
just 
you know it anyway, it's just common sense that, I mean you know how to cross the road now, don't ya?, look one way and that

well we just do this, people get asked this  drive as responsible and  driving that children under fourteen are sitting  
sit down 
when they are travelling, in the front a child, now one year, must use an approved child restrain design for age and weight, a child over one may wear any approved child restraint on adult seat belt, in the rear a child must be restrained and the appropriate restrain is fitted, the  the term appropriate restrain includes the following; infants under one year old, a carry or cot which is held by straps, children one, two or three years in appropriate child seat or harness or booster cushion with an adult belt, not a household cushion.
Children from four to fourteen year old an appropriate child seat or harness.
In the rear an adult may be restrained in preference to the child, however an adult must not deny a child the use.
Do not carry children in the middle of space by the rear seats of an estate car or a hatch back unless the manufacturer has provide the seat for this purpose.
Signs, know your traffic signs, right, signals, give signal , give signals if they would help or warn other road users  watch out for the signals of other drivers and motor cyclists or pedal cyclists and take necessary action from them.
You must obey the signals given by a police officer 
 
way  no way, see them man.
Moving off, before moving off always use your mirrors, but look round as well for a final check, signal as necessary before moving out, move off only when you can do so safely without making the road user change speed or direction  right
you gonna ask us some questions?
I'm gonna in a minute  driving along  what must you do when you're driving along?
take care
what else?
I don't get what you mean anyway
well when you're driving along give us some of the things what you do, tell us something that you do  when you're driving along
keep an eye on traffic ahead
use your mirrors often, that you know what is behind you and that each sign  is what you said 
erm  check all your speed limits 
driving along, keep to the left except when road signals or markings indicate otherwise or when you intend to overtake, or turn right, or when you have to pass stationery vehicles or pedestrians in the road, allow others to overtake you if they want you, you must not drive on  by the side of the road.
Use your mirrors, on narrow or winding roads or where there is a lot of oncoming traffic, drivers of large or slow moving vehicles should be prepared to pull in and slow down to stop as soon as there is suitable opportunity, well, before you take off or turn left or turn right, or slow down or stop, use your mirrors, you should always look behind even if they're none, a motor cycle should always look behind either, then give the appropriate signal if necessary , remember the routine
yes
what?
reverse, signal and manoeuvre 
always keep a special look out for cyclists particularly when overtaking or turning, bearing in mind that two wheels are much less easy to see than large vehicles.
Driving for long distances may make you sleepy, to help prevent this make sure there is plenty of fresh air in your vehicle, if you become tired on the journey, stop and rest at a suitable parking place , right.
You must obey the speed limits for the road and for your vehicle, remember the, except the motorways there is a thirty mile per hour speed limit on all roads, where there are streets unless sign show otherwise.
Bear in mind that any speed limit is a maximum, it does not mean that it is safe to drive at that speed, always take into account all the conditions at the time, never drive so fast that you cannot stop well within the distance you can see to be clear.
Go much more slowly if the road is wet or icy or first  drive more slowly at night, remember it can be especially difficult to see pedestrians or cyclists at night and in poor daylight conditions, do not break, sharply, except in an emergency.
Leave enough space between you and the vehicle in front so that you can pull up safely if it slows down or stops suddenly, the safe rule is never to get closer than the overall stopping distance shown below, but on the open road in good conditions leave a gap of one metre for each mile an hour of your speed or a two second time gap may be enough, they will also leave space for an overtaking vehicle pulling or wet or icy or the gap should be at least double that, drop back if you know that taking vehicle closing gap in front of you  make way for ambulance, fire engines, police or van emergency vehicles when their blue lamps are flashing or their bells, two tone cones or sirens or .
In towns, give way to buses indicating, an intention to move out from the bus stops, if you can do so safely.
Use of microphones and car telephones 
They won't use 
Do not use a hand held microphone 
 
or telephone when vehicles moving except in emergencies, you should only stick your fix  or clip on microphone where it will not distract your attention from road, do not stop on a hard shoul shoulder of a motorway to answer or make a call however urgent.
Driving in fog; when driving in fog check your  
eh?, check your what? your lights 
you see you  to do if you're not listening
check your lights?
no, I didn't say that
in the, in the fog, what you do?
what you do   when driving in fog check your 
speed, yes
and slow down, keep a safe distance, you should always be able to pull up within your range of vision , what else don't you do, what don't you do in fog?
overtake
hang on to somebody elses tail lights, it gives us a false sense of security  watch your speed, you may be going much faster than you think, do not speed up to get away from the vehicle which is too close behind you, remember that if you're driving with heavy people it may take longer to pull up and speed on ahead, warning signals or  


check and clean your wind screens, lights, reflectors and windows  remember that fog can give  is often patchy 
 
even though when it is clearing 
Sharon I only wanna learn this bit by bit, you know, not the whole book 
a pelican crossing has the signals have the same meaning as traffic lights except that the flashing amber signal will follow the red stop signal, when amber light is flashing you must give 
I  
what you do when amber light flashing? after the stop 
stop stop at the  line stop behind the line 
you must give way to any pedestrians on the crossing, so, otherwise you may proceed   a straight pelican is one crossing even when there is a central refuge and you must wait for people crossing from the further side of the refuge, don't harass the pedestrians for instance by revving your engine.
When turning into a road junction, give way to   what's a road junction?
like a  coming out
oh, give way to
traffic coming out
pedestrians who are crossing the road in which you are turning   when entering or emerging from property bordering on a road, give way to pedestrians as well as the traffic on the road, remember pavements are for people, not for motor cycles  motor vehicles 
is it here?
I don't take .
Lines and lanes along the road.
A single broken line with long markings and short gaps in the middle of the road is the  
what lines?
single broken lines with long markings and short gaps with the middle, in the middle of the road is the  hazard warning lines, do not cross it unless you can see that the road well ahead is clear.
Where there are double white lines along the 
give way 
road and the line nearer to you is solid, you must not cross or straddle it, except when you need to get in and out of the premises on side road.
Where there are double white lines along the road and the line nearer to you is broken, you may cross the lines to overtake if you .
Overtaking, give us some, do not overtake unless you can  do so without 
slow motors down or causes 
 
I was just gonna say  
before you start overtaking make sure the road is clear, use your mirror, signal before you move out 
signal, then move out 
be careful in the dusk, remember mirror, signal, manoeuvre  once you start to overtake move quickly passed the vehicle you are overtaking, when overtake er, overtake only on the right except when the driver in the front has signalled that he intends to turn right, you can overtake him on the left, without getting in the way, when you want to turn left at a junction, when traffic is moving slowly in queues and be er, in a lane on the right and moving more slowly than you are, in one way streets, but not dual carriageways, maybe with a path on either side, when traffic is moving as described, do not increase your speed while being overtaken, slow down if necessary to let the overtaking vehicle pass.
On the tail, lane road, give way to vehicles coming towards you  you must not overtake if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a solid line on the out of you, erm if you're within a zig zag area, the pelican crossing, after a normal overtaking sign until the end of the restriction, do not overtake when you cannot see far enough ahead, for example, when coming through 
bend
a corner or bend 
single traffic, single line traffic
hump back bridge  or the brow of the hill, or where you might come into conflict with the car, with other road users for example at 
junctions
the road junction 
roundabout
don't say that   a level crossing or where the road narrows, on approached any type of pedestrian crossing or where it would involve driving over an area marked with diagonal stripes to or che chevrons, do not overtake when you do so would force another vehicle to swerve or slow down, if in doubt do not overtake   so where'd you not overtake?
on a corner
or
hump backed bridge
mm
round a bend, junction
yeah,
 

at a level cross , at a level crossing or where the road bends, or approach to any pedestrian crossing.
Road junctions.
Approach road junctions with great care, consider your road position and your speed, drive on only when you are sure it is safe to do so and that you will not block the junction, watch out for long vehicles which maybe turning left or right, at the junction ahead, but which may have to use  to make a turn, when waiting to emerge at a junction, do not assume that a vehicle approaching from the right which is signalling with it's left hand direction indicator would turn left, wait to make sure  do you know what I mean?
that, if you leave and that car comes and signals left, it means that you've got to wait for it to go in, in case it doesn't you know what I mean.
At a junction with double broken white lines across the road it
may also have the give way sign on invert inverted triangle on the carriageway, you must be ready to let traffic on the major road go first.
At junctions with a stop sign and a solid white line across your approach, you must stop at the line, wait for a safe gap in the traffic before you move.
When crossing the dual carriageway or turning right into the road, treat each half as a separate road, wait
do you know what it means by that?
in the cen central driving, dividing strip 
do you know what that means
until there is a safe gap
do you know what 
it means you come to turn right on  road, and each 
it's er 
lanes a separate road doesn't it?
you know when you come, you know when you and nanny drop us off at ours
aha
and there's a slip road you've gotta come on to, there's a slip road you go down ain't there?
aha
you slowly make your way out, don't got by, you look over your right shoulder
aha
that's erm, that's a slip road what you, and then, your next lane you stay in that lane, only use a right and then if you want to overtake you go into right and then back into right
oh
I mean never stay in the right hand lane
why?
because you overtake is speeding there, the left hand lane isn't, the right hand lane is for overtaking
what happens at our speed?
well you stick on the right hand lane when no one overtaking  that's not causing trouble for us is it?
Where a junction has a mini roundabout, it will have a sign placed before the give way.
Boxed junctions have criss cross yellow lines painted on the road.
You must not enter the box 
you stay behind it
if your exit road or lane from, from is not clear, but you may enter the box when you want to turn right and are prevented from doing so.
Junctions controlled by police or a traffic warden, when all traffic is held up by police officer or traffic warden you must not go left or right until you are signalled to do so.
Junctions controlled by traffic lights  do not go forward when the traffic lights are green unless there is room for you to clear the junction safely, never go forward when the red, amber lights are shown together, when traffic lights have a green arrow filter signal, do not get into the lane when filtering is allowed unless you .
Well, before you turn right use your mirror to make sure you know the position on movement of the traffic behind you.
When it is safe, give a right turn signal and as soon as you can do so take safely, take up position just left of the middle of the road or in the space marked by right turned vehicles, if you can leave room for other vehicles to pass on the left, wait until there is a safe gap between you and any oncoming vehicle, looking, look out of sight for motor cyclists and pedestrians, then make a turn, but do not cut the corner as people like pedestrians crossing the road in which you are turning.
Remember mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
When approaching a roundabout   I'm not testing you any more
I was laughing at her, that fake thing she's got on it
I'm not testing you any more
I'll test you then 
What's the  
you know carriage a single carriage way?
mm
now a  a dual carriage way that has three lanes, what lane do you use?
the left 
right, what one you use for overtaking?
mm?
what one you use for overtaking?
right
middle lane
all three lanes is the taught now, middle 
middle lane, you never stay in it either
so what's the last 
it's just 
one for?
turn right
turn, aye
see the one  
 
like, you know, on the opposite side of the road, you've got as much right to use that as he has 
right 
on a single carriageway where a road has four, four lanes, do not use
on a single carriageway where a lane has got four lanes
yeah, if a single carriageway or has four more lanes, do not use the right hand path, you use that one and that one, but don't use them two
why?er, if  plain English that right in it?
it's the same, same as er three way one
so you've gotto take on fast moving traffic or turn right?right are we asking some more questions?,
I don't know that much really, I don't know 
right
I 
I'm gonna ask you some stopping distances
I don't know them
well you're gonna learn them, cos you've got, they, they ask you straight away that    a built up area
mm?
what's the speed limit for a built up area?
thirty
single carriage ways?
fifty
and by the way it's not seventy the coast road
mm?
who said it was seventy up the coast road?
dunno
was it you or Don?
I don't know
well he says it's the national speed limit, seventy
with the black line it is
aye
that's what 
it'll have a speed li , your national speed limit will be sixty
but you don't do it
it's a single, it's a two, it's only a single lane traffic car 
what?
you know when you say, when  you are, I'm positive it was you and your  cos er he turned round and he says er, oh yeah
no the  
it's seventy 
that's  what mile do you do on it?, like some people might think the national speed limit, but it's not that's fifty or sixty 
national speed limit on the tunnel it's a dual carriage way, it's two lane 
it's got fifty 
it's a seventy
is it seventy?
it's seventy like it's a dual carriageway 
well it tells you and if it's any less than seventy
no, I'm sure one of you says it was seventy for the coast road, it's only a two way traffic 
 
it's a two way traffic, a single lane traffic so it's classed as sixty
but it tells you on the thing, it, a white thing with a line through it 
right 
means seventy though Darren
motorways
doesn't it?, eh?, well that's got one of them on
well it shouldn't have, it should have sixty on it, it's only single carriageway
it's got er, it's got one of them white things with a black line on it I'm sure
the national speed limit, aye
seventy 
you've got two, that's not your, you've got two national speed limits, you've got a sixty and a seventy, seventy is for like a dual carriageway and a motorway, sixty is a single carriageway cos it's only two way traffic
so white line with a black thing through could be just sixty
it could be sixty, if you're on a  if you're on a two way traffic right 
mot what's on a motorway?
if you're on a motorway at seventy 
or a dual carriageway 
if you're on, if you're on a motorway or a carriageway, right
it's seventy 
it's seventy 
unless stated otherwise
right
mm
now if you go along the coast road and it's, you look at the lamp post right they have a little white circle with a black line in it
aha
you must look at your lanes, you've only got like two lanes haven't ya?
aha
coming down and going about sixty, shows you there, single carriageways sixty
oh
dual carriageway is er double that
yeah
you always stay to your left, only use the right lane to overtake or turn to right
you asking me?
I ask you, right a single carriageway, what's your speed for that?
see seventy on the crossroad
well you, you would of got done
, no, mind, some of them do when when  
I know that's why you would of got done if the police had stopped
stopping what?
what's a single, single carriageway?
thirty, sixty
dual carriageway
seventy
motorway?
seventy 
right, I wanna ask you some signs before, before you go onto the  your speed limits, I wanna know like when I do, you know when you've done your speed limits and you stop 
aha 
I want your thinking distance, your stopping distance and your overall, right
aha
even if you get them wrong, I'll put them right, it's the only way you'll learn 
Hi ya
hi ya
hi
hi ya
hi ya
hi ya 
Ee what's Darren doing down 
I know he's dressed an all
oh dressed er, ooh, hello there
right  circle right
aha
with forty in the middle
forty mile an hour
that's the maximum speed you can do 
oh aye 
white circle with a black line, diagonal
national speed limit
yeah  like a fifty pence piece one right
aha hexagon 
with a stop 
stop, under 
where's John gone?
he's out
where?
a triangle 
travel the night now
he what?
travel in night
what do you mean?

it's worse than that in it?
they've got 
eight hundred
Tommy eight hundred they've gone 
they gone where?, to Peacock 
it's  for the first three
they had to save  
they've gotta beat what?
oh
will Pam pay weekly do you think?
I'm gonna pay it up in one
Tommy, I'm getting a six, I'm getting a  six weeks on a B reg
mm
have a full years test on it
mm
full years tax it'll have all the 
what car is it?
tyres and all that done
mm
you know that new thing with, your catalytic converter
aye
it'll have all that done to it, for eight hundred pound
yeah 
mm, mm good
nice 
so when you getting that?,
August
getting August and I 
got some belts in the back an all mam
I can have it before that like, but I, I'll wait until me loans finished  
just the test force now 
ah
oh I know, I'll be passed before August
well passed before
do you think you will Sharon?
no
she doesn't think 
no I know mum, I don't think I'll be passed before August even if I don't 
I had a funny dream about you
 
 
you will Sharon
I don't feel as though I
no your sit and smooth Elsa and I went off in heed, I am Tommy
what?
I si , sitting there like that 
had a bad dream then  
who, who when's that?, is that the dream?
what, but, it's about the Co-Op, I went to the Co-Op in me dream, nothing but  have on, and I was getting some of them what must have been a monthly thing
this is crazy 
aye
writing my name and address and everything and then she went away, she says oh won't be a minute, she come back she says oh it is Mrs , no


Mrs  yeah I was  laughing, she was rolling around on the floor laughing, yes I said oh it's 
and then what happened?, you come back
and then I come back and then I went to see them again and they were all on a great big table as though they were celebrating a party and Joyce said er 
and you and you went, what did you say?
she's, I says oh it's Mrs  here
have we done enough with the signs?
no
I tell you what
what's a red circle then?
 
what's a red triangle?
what's a small triangle
a triangle with give way in it 
he doesn't 
he does, he wants those smarties and he knows, he knows where they'll be 
give way on what?
on coming traffic
what do you want?
you give, give way to the 
to the right 
no
what do you want?
with oncoming traffic on the major road
well that's what I wanna know, that's right, that's all I wanna know, never give way to traffic on the, on the right, you could pull out on it, if indicating
two cars in a circle a black and a red one 
she seems to be struggling an all doesn't she?
no, something, something she said
er
something, well I says
don't know
oh it's a  
no overtaking 
next day
aye and she said  
aye and you'll have to start saving this month 
a circle a red circle
aye
with a little red arrow
sarcastic git
goes up and a big black arrow goes down 
I was gonna say so we don't have to
they've got right of way they waiting 
it's all should it? should it?
you give priority to the vehicles on opposite side 
 
motorbike on the top and a car on the bottom in a circle
no overtaking motor cycles 
no motor vehicles  what's the one with the car in?
eh?
what's the one with the car in?
no vehicles, cars 
no vehicles except scooters, motorbikes  and moped  erm  did I ask you that one with er, it's a red circle right
mm, mm
it's a blue background
mm, mm
and it's got a red X in it
no entry
that one there  you'll see it on motorways
I know what it is
but 
right, hang on, hang on then clever shit, just spare me here  right, your wrong, well what do you think it is?
er, fair enough that's  
er Darren I thought that was a old  
er
how er now know this
I did not know scho is it not no
no 
I've seen it and I cannot think
Sharon
you must know this on a motorway like Sharon
no, it's seventy mile speed limit
you phone Martha?
me dad was here
your speed limit one er is white with a black arrow, straight black through
Sharon, you must know this on a motorway
I've seen it before I cannae think
ha lights
no
no, but it 
no, no, no you know what it means? you cannot stop, you are in a no stopping zone
right
and then when it's got that and it's got end on the bottom here, at the end of the stopping zone, you've got to know that on a motorway
right
right
no stopping zone
right  I wannae know what
I wannae know
it goes like that right
what?
like black line like
aha
and then it goes like that on each side, what does that mean?
left and right turn, oh there's no turn 
no, I tell you what it'll be easier if 
it's going into one lane 
road narrows
it's going into one lane
aye, you're wrong on that,
it's going in a single lane
no, think where it is?, two lane traffic, where is it?, it's a carriageway in it?
er 
dual carriageway
carriageway ahead
no, it ends, your off the dual carriageway
well that's what I said, you can only go one way 
carriageway ahead well it's that's not the same Sharon is it?, cos you've failed your test 
erm end of dual, end of dual carriage way end of dual carriage way
I just said it, I'm saying it  end of dual carriageway
what's a black arrow pointing up over with a black arrow pointing down over in a triangle?
two lane traffic
no, but what?, you've got that bit right, two way traffic straight ahead, right 
so that's fine like if you're coming off a dual carriageway, maybe you'll see that 
and what's it running that way? and that way?
left and right hand turn
no
huh
go on
that way and that way  well
cross a one way road
cross, crossroads
no, no, he would of failed
what?
it crosses a one way road, you're coming up right
and there's a one way road going like that 
say, and there's a one way road coming along, it's got a two way traffic on the top, but it crosses it
aye
do you know what I mean?
ahead
aha 
there's two way traffic where you've gotta cr cross the one way road 
you've gotta cross the one way road 
so that's two arrows going that way
aha
right 
oh well you know what them are
well ask us Darren, I mightn't
just straight with a little tiny snip out of it 
eh?
it's er, it's a thing like that with a little tiny, a little tiny
bend
from the middle, no, does that look like a bend to you, that's a bend
can I, slip road
no
yeah
you've got to go for size of the 
 
for turning off 
traffic merges from that side
you mean like a slip road?
slip roads when you turn off
aye, well like, like traffic merging from it though  don't sigh 
what's a blue box with three white lines in it?
three way traffic
you have to know that on the motorway an all
three lanes
that's it
what, with three lines across it?
three, it means you've got three for every lane, it's a hundred yards to your stopping distance, to you come to a junction
you have to start 
you never see 
start with a hundred
you never see them on the motorways
mm, mm
like you say you just get onto that right and it's, that's three hundred yards and you get the next one that's two hundred yards and a hundred yards until you stop, to the junction
cos does that you mean you've gotta stop 
it counts they're, they're markers to count down 
you've gotta start breaking when you see three
no
no one 
one, as soon as you get, well you've gotta work out what your speed is then, break, break your speed down to your stopping distance, say it's thirty, you wannae stop slowing down at  forty five feet  right, that's what you have to know  erm 
well Darren you're cramming too much in me head right now
well ask me some then
it's cramming too much in, I'm getting confused, I get 
well I wanna learn new stopping distances here, no I'm not being funny Sharon
you know them, so why you asking?
well I want you to learn them  it doesn't take much to learn them either  going to learn them
I used to know them
right, here's your stopping distances  read them, I'll give you till five to ten, got ten minutes
what that mean twen , is it metres or what? in metres 
go in feet go in feet it's better 
which ones that?, the red or the black?
what's the black?
mile an hour twenty, thinking distance twenty, what's it?
is it?, oh  think twenty, twenty, forty
I want the distance, black 
take the distance the black well look  
the black is feet 
the black is feet
right
right, twenty mile an hour right, shh twenty
the reds thinking distance in it?
no
there's one of them thinking distance in it?
you've got stopping distance, thinking distance overall you see
sshh
dead easy
should know that an all 
three coloured line at the motorway, see the next, its stop, you're not supposed to stop, you're not supposed to stop the flow of traffic
 
you don't go on a motorway for driving lessons
thirty miles, it's forty
you only drive 
thirty feet is it? in the town, thirty miles, sixty feet is it?is it Sharon?
don't 
thirty mile, that's sixty feet is it Sharon?
shh, er  I'm trying to learn mine 
thirty miles 
thirty mile an hour 
it's seventy five feet
seventy five 
seventy five 
I thought it sixty something, in fact I thought, I was gonna say seventy seven
how'd ya work it out, is there a way to work it out
aye
how?
twenty mile an hour right
aha, goes to forty
your thinking distance, right your thinking distance is twenty
aha
right
aha
your stopping distance is thirty five
no it's not
your stopping distance for twenty miles an hour is twenty
no
it is and your overall is forty
well it doesn't say that
twenty, twenty, forty
what's that mean, so you, what you doing twenty mile an hour you think that you can stop in twenty mile an hour, at twenty feet
at twenty feet is you start braking it down 
 
and then what's that mean braking
a hundred, a hundred and forty feet for seventy
it takes twenty feet
twenty feet to stop
it's a hundred and forty feet
then overall stopping distance, what does that mean then?
that's forty feet
what does that mean?
that's seventy miles an hour 
at forty at forty feet right
aha
you start slowing it down right, right
when?
and then, when you get to twenty feet, right?
aha?
now you start thinking then when you come to the junction and also you're slowing down, by the time you've done that, them two stages you should have all your gears ready and you should be prepared for it
so how'd ya work it out?
at seventy mile it should be your hundred and forty feet
shouldn't have 
no you shouldn't it should be three hundred and fifteen, the overall length, seventy is your think, thinking distance for that is seventy and your stopping distance should be two, four, five
how'd ya work it out Darren, you gonna tell us or not?
it's so simple
right, well it is
ere move up
I have er, I know, forty, a hundred and twenty two,seventy five a hundred seventy five and three 
work on all these right
aha
twenty miles an hour right is forty, right
yeah
to get there, right
thirty mile an hour is seventy five, right
aha
forty is a hundred and twenty, fifty is one seven five, sixty is two forty, seventy is three fifty right
aha
now ask you twenty, what, the thinking distance for twenty mile an hour right
forty
no it's not 
what then?
twenty
twenty
right, now your braking distance is twenty an all, right
yeah
no it's forty, twenty, twenty, forty right
I can get that one alright
thirty, right
thirty, forty five and seventy five
right, ask us, ask us any of them, you think the distance to stop
twenty
twenty 
twenty 
what's your braking distance?
twenty 
twenty is your braking distance and your overall should be the  there in the middle, which is forty, that's cos
oh you add one
aye
there and it's erm
thirty
thirty, forty five and seventy five, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy five 
now forty is a hundred and twenty, right
aha
so forty, forty mile 
that would be 
an hour right, so, your thinking distance would be the same mile as what?, your distance is forty and then
you want  
take that off and what have you got, it leaves you eighty as your braking distance
oh
all the time
seventy, right
I know
your thinking distance is seventy, now what's seventy ov 
no let let me, let me 
right, I'll ask you then  right
forty, er thirty
see  learning all them  see Elsa
what?
didn't even know her stopping distances 
summat you'll learn when you're in the car though
no, he'll can't, he won't learn you Tommy
oh
you've gotta, you've got to learn that yourself
oh
this is just for your test when they ask you
but you should know 
you're not saying well I'm a hundred and seventy five feet away
no, but you should be able to guess
I  a hundred and seventy five feet 
what, close enough
as it is, I know what one metre and that's about it 
 
how long would you say this street is?
I've got no idea dad, honest to god
 
thirty, forty metres 
the whole street is about two hundred and fifty metres long
it's not
two hundred and fifty, it can't be that long
it's not that long dad
no, I suppose a hundred and fifty
I knew those distances 
hundred and fifty metres 
no, I would say about fif , forty, fifty
why you nodding?
no
it's over a hundred
it's not
about ninety
it's twenty five metres from  and back, I say seventy five at the most  no fif , I'll say sixty
I said forty six  
six, sixty metres 
do you know what your braking, stopping distance
well I 
from what it is in the snow?
what?
you know erm, your stopping distances 
no 
in the snow?
twice the distance is it?
times ten
is it?
seventy mile an hour takes 
sshh 
three thousand feet to stop
