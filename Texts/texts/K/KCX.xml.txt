That's it.
And then it gets me.
Stay in the car then!
Then, he were being a pig last night.
I says to him, with him breaking down other night  his dinner went to dog.
The night before I kept it hot, and hot, and hot, and hot, and by time we did get it at quarter to eight  I says to him, oh this is horrible, this!
Ooh!

So last night, I thought, I won't do anything till he comes in  but we'd got company  and er, they went outside, they were having a look at car engine and that, telling us what were wrong, you know.
And, so I says to him d'ya fancy going to fish shop?
So he decided he wanted chips, pie, curry, loads of scraps and bread and everything and he eat every bit of it up!
Didn't you?

Oh!

You know, before you couldn't see your  thingy  that
Right!
Where am I going?
No.
You're going to National Tyres on North Bridge.
And they're going to balance your wheels.
Oh I know.
Checking and balancing.
I don't know about checking and balancing, I just says balancing.
I'll let you 
Can you get insurance to pay for it?
It's four pound something a wheel  there.
Oh!
That's dear.
Is 
So 
that dear?
well they says to go there, get an invoice  take it into the insurance  and they will send us a cheque back out.
Usually, when they balance your wheels they  they check the tracking.
They're gonna deduct it.
I phoned up  put Maggie on t' phone, told her sa tell her what this bloke had said  and, they said, just a minute, that they'll get in touch wi insurance and phone us back.
Well they phoned back  and  they said, can you tell your husband to take his car to National Tyres  er, that  insurance has sent him, and could they give him an invoice  for the insurance company.
Like, we pay, give 
Yeah.
them an invoice, he's got to take the invoice into insurance 
 
they will  deduct that off  the value 
 
I think 
The value.
send us it, and they can have the rest.
Yeah.
And they says, check it.
Well they won't give him it straight away, they'll see to you first.
They always do.
We haven't finished yet.
But I says, that they were, I, that he weren't satisfied when it were vibrating and that.
And he says, gerrit checked or summat.
So  he's gonna ask them what he does about the vibrating.
National Tyre, I don't think they'll do bonnet.
No!
I dunno.
But, you're going in insurance.
I know.
You're telling them yoursen.
I'm sick of telling them!
I'm sick of car!
Wish we'd never heard of car dealers.
 Kirksandle Car Care
They're no good!
D'ya know, everybody we've 
 
spoke to since then, they says, why the heck didn't you say summat?
You shouldn't have took it there!
One fella were told  they did his erm  summat to his engine  and it blew up didn't it?
Blew up, yeah.
His engine blew up!
Er, Dennis, who we were talking to last night, he says, you must be absolutely mental!
He says that his mate bought a car from there  and, he were a  undecided about this clocking  this time, what's, what call it?
He'd er  wound the clock back  thirty thou.
But you know on his log book, last person  that had the car he went down to see them, and they told him that it were thirty thousand over from when they sold it.
Yeah, but when they got it, you don't have to ask for owt er, M O T.
He went to see person who  selt it.
Might have got old M O T.
And, they were on, more on about that.
I says, ah marvellous!
I says, you don't hear a word about anybody  till you go.
Until after.
And then afterwards
Well, I mean, look at me, me with my motor car

Off it went.
And mine's black.
You know, it sounds I spent .
D'ya know, he stuck in all day Wednesday.
Well it past half past ten, you think he'd be up and getting ready for work.
He might be up.
He don't know his dad's in this morning.
He's hiding.
He's always hiding.
Er, what time is it?
Quarter past nine?
Yeah.
He'll go out and get that  five to ten bus or five past ten bus.
Stops upstairs all the time.
Cos I've upset his girlfriend!
Is that Amanda?
Which one?
I don't know.
I told him  he'd better tell his friends, or his girlfriends, that when they call at our house if they don't give names, they're not talking to him!
I says, cos I haven't the faintest idea who they are.
I've says  your Mark, I says, he always says, is that Mrs ?
It's Mark.
Will you ask Steven if I can talk to him please?
And, there's one called Gavin, he rings up, and  the girlfriend, he did have, whether it's still same one, I don't know  called Sarah.
Well, I says to him, I'm getting sick of these calls cos  you don't know if it's for  him or him.
We have the same name.
And er  I picked it up other night, says, can I ta speak to Steven?
I said, no!
So she di still didn't say her name!
So, she says, will you give Steven a message?
I says, no!
Talk to him when you see him.
Well will you ask Steven to call me back?
I says, no!
She give me no telephone number, no name  nothing!
So, she said, oh!
Alright, and put phone down.
And I still didn't know who it were.
I thought, if I keep saying no  she'll say, well it's Sarah  or  whoever  but, no chance!
No name!
No phone number!
No nothing!
Ee!
It's bloody cold out there!
I know.
And it's foggy.
Oh, it weren't bad.
Just washed my eyes, I can see now.
We had a struggle this morning coming out, my windows were all mucky outsi go it got, a car, van had passed me.
I put my window washers on and my windows froze up!
They will do.
Yeah, see me come up 
Yeah but it didn't seem as though it were freezing though did it?
coming home last night, I stopped  half way 
 
home  bloody needed checking the lights!
Oh!
Don't mention lights.
Keep flashing me to say that I've got my headlights on so I, when I, I give them flash back to say no I haven't.
Oh.
They do that with me.
When I've been taking Paul to work in the morning  they've been giving me flashes and then  if I, you know, flashed them back  they haven't put their headlights on so I thought oh bugger yous!
So I put mine on.
They don't like mine.
Don't like mine.
Mine, my beams shines 
So 
into the cars.
Mine does.
He's got six lights up front.
Paul, I says, your lights aren't set properly!
I says, yeah but it's passed its M O T for lights.
Exactly!
It did!
Cos mine had.
He's just had to alter them hisen!
Somebody, if they were wrong you'd think they'd tell you wouldn't you?
They're supposed to.
But there's no mention of lights!
I sent mine, I took that  it was out.
I said give us screwdriver, I'll do it here and now.
He says, why?
I says, well it seems daft taking it back, to fetch it back.
He said, I'm not failing you on it.
I said no, but yo you've got your marks on your wall I said I can cha do it now.
But this one  I can do mesen.
But 
Yeah.
I mean
Yeah.
Dipped lights though, it's just like a guess.
Not if I've got it set.
We know they're wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah I know.
Yeah, they're just like headlights mine is.
I've got the same, but usually I have eight on front of car.
So I says, Paul, I says, get me some spotlights.
That's what's missing ont front of ours.
When he crashed we've not had anything replaced.
Cos, before you crash  we had six lights on t' back and we had eight on t' front.
Cos he's got  them four headlights  with 
Mm.
the  either side, then below  the bumper thing, we had the fog lights  and above the bumper we had two spotlights.
Now, on the back  I bought him some extra fog lights for back  and I bought him them fog lights that goes int window.
D'ya know?
So if 
Yeah 
the light int window, and on bumper  and fog light.
He come back, we've got  headlights on t' front  two fog lights  and we got brake lights on t' back.
No fog lights, no nothing.
That's all we've got!
I says, to him, there's six lights missing off here.
I says, they cost me over two hundred quid, I says, for the six lights!
But, them at Car Care turned round and says, it's not on t' invoice.
All we keep getting off them is  I says, you mean to say, we're paying two and half thousand pounds worth of repairs, I says, and they're not done?
And then when we went for wheel balancing  told us to take it back for balancing and tracking, they turned round and says we're not doing it.
Take it to another garage.
We told Maggie that.
So I says to Maggie, we'll phone insurance, I put her on t' phone, and she said he were, he were right clever with her!
And er  that's why they haven't got in contact and that.
So he, took it back before and put brand new bonnet that they've put on.
Didn't fit!
And he says, when he gets it up to sixty mile an hour on t' motorway it's still vibrating.
Yeah.
So, he's gonna go int insurance this morning, tell them that er  bonnet's still vibrating and they've supposed to have done it twice  and that, because of er  ask them where he can take to have all these repair jobs done.
You know, checked over.
Cos, he went in there  summat to do wi headlights or summat, one were  like up and down or summat.
And he went in and he said  they haven't even bloody welded this!
They've done a tack.
I says, you're alright, I said, front radiator's gonna bleeding drop off!
So  he's gonna see about that this morning.
I says to him, take a day off work for, I says, for God's sake!
So  he took today off.
So you were saying, he's only upstairs just now.
Grandma.
Steve.
You got that that bag.
Could you fetch my keys from upstairs please?
Grandma.
You've got 
Ta.
that.
Yeah.
Grandma.
Grandma's got that bag.
Has she?
Yeah.
Kath's got a lot of bags hasn't she?
I've got another one upstairs.
Do you know, fellas, who'd have them?
Oh!
That's  
One minute, she starts collecting one thing  then you start collecting another thing Christmas, he come home with one of them.
That lad at work, that John what they call him?
And that, and that's  
He give him one.
And er  he's got hundreds of them apparently.
So he's decided  he wants to collect them now.
Wow!
I've got Tetleys tea.
Is that the  
I've got so 
then?
I've got Kelloggs.
Is it Kelloggs?
Don't know that
No don't touch them.
 
No I won't.
That was the er, last one that she'd seen they said that .
Them Kelloggs.
Yeah.
Got a lot of them.
That's like granddad.
They're Walkers crisps.
They're Walker crisps.
Kelloggs.
I don't know what that 
They're like grandma.
one upstairs is.
And er 
Like grandma's.
I said to Maggie  I says, Steve's collecting cars  I says, it don't matter if it's int box or not, I says, if they're int box they're staying in a box.
I says, and I'm buying him a rack  for the ones  not in a box.
With Tetleys tea now you send away and get a  like a little minibus thing.
Oh.
We don't get Tetleys teas though.
We don't get that at all.
I always used to 
I've just got enough for one, er one car.
One car .
He couldn't stop buying .
He says, there's not much point in getting P G or Tetleys from one tea bag and making four 
Look!
cups.
Cos what he does, he puts a tea bag in a cup  pours about that much water on  takes the tea bag out and tops it right up with water so he can see bottom of cup.
And then he uses same tea bag again.
That's why  
Well that Tetley tea bags taste strong though.
Hot.
Hot.
One tea bag does me and Paul.
That's all we put int teapot, one tea bag.
That's just not strong.
Well that's good that Tetleys tea stuff.
I'm sure you do get a  a  
I doubt it like.
Cos you never do do you?
Well, no!
So  got wo .
Get four cups.
Yeah.
Can I have it?
What?
It's been there a fortnight  and I keep asking everybody if they want to try it.
And I told Steve to drink it, and he says no, and wi you mentioning Tetleys and I don't 
Oh, he'll not drink Tetleys.
You have been in my bag again!
I haven't been in your bag!
I can tell you haven't!
I have not been in your bag!
So, in that case, you've dropped it.
I picked it up and it were  th the er  strap got the wrong way round.
Tt!
So it all went out?
So I had to pick it all up.
And how come he's good enough to go the Sea Cadets but he's not good enough to go college?
Because he don't go till half past ten this morning.
Oh!
Changed my mind.
But I know Tetleys tea bags  er  one tea bag does me and Paul.
And I have it stronger than what this coffee is.
You'll have to save it till Paul comes back   for the car .
I've got enough for one car for mesen.
Ah!
Will you save some more  and then you can send for 
Okay.
a  gonna save me some Tetley tea tokens for a car.
Oh thank you.
Cos she has Tetleys, and we don't.
Oh Right.
Don't like it.
Just give her that tea, it's Tetley tea.
Save .

In fact, I'm gonna get his present.
Well it's not even a proper bloody jar is it?
It's a plastic thing.
That's what it says, if you don't like the tea, you get a free  jar !
What the bloody hell can you do with that?
Did I give you a diary?
I can't remember if I did cos I've been picking them up.
Every time I go int bank  they, just leave them on t' counter, they've been there weeks and weeks.
And normally, they're all gone so, and I thought, oh!

I says, between the electric and that, I says, thirty nine pound a week, I says, every week, I says, is getting a bit ridiculous!
Cos in that electric meter, I don't know what they've done to it!
I phoned it up and says the fella had been out, you know, they change, update it 
Yeah.

That lights all yard up.
Well, before they put that token in it, then my bills used to come in about fifty, sixty pound.
But since they put the token meter in, I've just found they're charging me nine pound for token meter as well as the meter!
You know, you get charged for your meter?
Cos I ca I were querying on t' bill, I says, why is it  two meters?
Er, because he's got to come out and read it.

That's it.
Aye cos  
Quarter to twelve while gone one o'clock.

If there's no kids what's the point of  
There's nobody comes out she says.

So I bet that's thirty five to forty five, is it forty five after  thirty five before, forty five after?
Mm.
Cos they charged me twenty five on Little Nipper and it's cheaper on Little Nipper than bus.
But they didn't half charge.
Cos I nearly died  I got on bus other day and they charged me eighty five pence   I looked at me clock and it were twenty past nine.
See I, mind you whenever I'm late you see I can get on it for twenty pence  except for first thing in morning.
Well that's beside the point.
 
That's beside the point.
Oh aye I always charge them bus fares.
Well that's it, I don't blame you.

I noticed, I were looking at prices, they're all different prices.
I mean it's same with Marks and Sparks, you buy owt at Marks and Sparks it's only because when they have them packed, they've got to put their name on it.
Yeah.
You're paying for name aren't you?
That's the only trouble.
Because they do with potatoes, with crisps and that.

She stated today.
Yes.
And I thought  
Well I think I think she's spent all that money what she's got off  already because 
She got her Family Allowance this morning as well.
No she ain't got the Family Allowance, she says oh I was gonna leave that cos I says to her I says  have you drawn your Family Allowance?
She says er no then she  afterwards I says well don't forget to get Kath's money she said tell her I'll phone her and I'll be up about half past six, I'll have to go and draw me money.
So it's the Family Allowance she's got to draw today.
So she's spent all that seventy odd quid?
Yeah.
It's a hell of a lot to spend in two days and the shops are shut on Sundays.
She's gone and owed a telly and a video, God knows how much that cost her.
Oh good God!
Ha!
I didn't realize it was still on.
No it's nearly finished.
Oh.
That side of tape's nearly gone, a few more minutes and then it's finished I think.
Sing a song.
Oh aye yeah, I can't sing.
 

Eh you should hear it with Irene  I thought she were gonna stab me with screwdriver.
Taping her earlier and she ke it's cos I kept going to put sixty four on to tt you know that thing I fill in to say who's on it?

And er she picked screwdriver up, well she thought it were a pen and I thought  God she's got a screwdriver and she's gonna stab me  and I put thirty plus thirty four
Yeah.
and did it like that, so she scribbled thirty four out and left thirty plus.
Thirty plus.
I thought ooh dear me.
It were funny.
I thought it were funny anyway.
Our Steve's got eye patch on now, he's had the doctor out.
Have you been talking to him today?
Yeah.
Did he tell you if he's seen Stephen?
He never mentioned him.
Oh.
I thought  doesn't this take a long time just for a little tiny bit?
Do you know  it is, it's a little tiny but it's going on for ages and ages.
Mm.
It's to stop me turning tape over I'm sure
I think it said five six seven eight nine ten or summat on one side and then it said six seven  eight nine on  other side.
It sort of doubled up, or summat like that, so she crossed them all out and changed them.
Ooh she's a .
Why?
There were two sixes and  two nines 
Well 
and two eights and what have you.
well still ca she can't just  in ten.
Well she didn't do them.

Somebody else did.
She just picked boxes up and delivered them.
Oh.
So it was like 
Well can't they count to ten?
I don't know.
They didn't bleeding look it, the   Well you can have half an hour in the morning and half an hour at night, that's an hour.
Yeah.
I got Michael to finish filling other one up  today .
Just talking about owt and nowt and
I know but if she s she starts talking she never bloody stops.
No er when Maggie's talking, if she knows it's on  she always tells me when to stop it.
Depends what she wants to say.
Same as you, only time when you didn't know what you thought and you've got to call everybody names and everything cos you don't know what to say, you can't think of forgetting it's here.
I know.
Well that's your fault.
No it isn't.
If you'd've just switched it on when I come in it'd've been totally different.
I wouldn't've known.
I know but  we've got telly on and everything haven't we?
So?
They've got background noise.
You don't worry about that.
Oh I always turn telly off.
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know if it can pick voices up with telly  on .
Well it should pick it all up if it's a good, good enough mike.
Well
They've been bloody computer games in work, the chuffs.

Well they've got a computer up in number two, and I went in tonight  they're playing chuffing Grand Prix.
I said Christ you're chuffing mad, no wonder you stop till ten o'clock.
He said what you on about?
I should have thought you were flogging on I says, you skiving  sods .
I thought you could only er do two hours?
I thought.
That's the impression I've been under but according to form you can do what you bloody want.
I do two hours
Yeah I know you do.
for the simple reason
You've got a long way to travel.
Yes.
If I didn't have so long to travel I'd do two and a half hours .
Ooh.
to talk to Gavin
Oh is he this new one you've ?
No  he's foreman.
Oh.
permanent position.
I says cos there ain't none.
Why, has he already been told?
Well
I know you've been told  different people different things.
I'll go and have a word with him   See what he says.
chance of that.
Mm yeah well I posted that one today for you.
Yeah well.
Oh you got ashtray quick, I haven't even got !
Well d I was gonna say it's your  
I've got three.
Ta.
So what did y she say when you told her?
You ought to a told her we'd bought one.
Bought one what?
Timeshare.
Oh  no!
She falls for it l hook line and sinker.
Then I forget that I've been joking with her  then she tells me off so  I don't bother any more.
She gets too serious.
So what?
She were on about Graham, she's seen him loads of times this week.
But it's only one week.
Last week.
Oh.
That talk I had to Johnny's not done m a blind bit of  good.
Waste of breath.
So, but, I know that, yeah.
They're getting old.
But then again Irene and Fred's old and they're not like that.
They argue like hell them two now, Irene and Fred.
Because he's at home.
No.
He's done er erm  tt what did she call it?
Summat like a takeover bid.
Now she's been having an argument with the council and  while she's been arguing, you know she's got a grievance, while she's  been arguing  she takes her anger out on them and tells them what she thinks of them.
So since Fred's been retired, he says leave it to me and, because he's that soft, nothing's done about it.
Oh.
And then she starts demanding to know what they're going to do and he keeps saying they're gonna write, they're gonna write, they're gonna write.
She says no they're not gonna write, I'm gonna phone them.
No don't you phone them, I'll phone them, she says well phone them now.
So he'll phone her and she'll say  and I'm still sat behind him rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, moan, moan, moan  you see.
So er they says to him who's that?
He says it's me wife and she's as mad as hell, and they says yeah we can hear her from here  and s must've said summat about writing and she  starts bawling and shouting, oh summat about  you've got to write  I want a letter by Friday, you're not messing me about no more, you're not talking to him you're talking to me.
And then she ran upstairs and grabbed the other phone  and Fred had to put phone down cos she wouldn't shut up .
So you see they were having a  difference of opinion over that and he's saying you shouldn't, you should've left it all to me and she says  I've done it for last fifty year  and, you know, all this.
Yes.
And she says you're stupid, you don't know how to talk to them and then they start, you see Fred won't row.
And same as she says, she needs a row to clear the air, so picks on him and he just ducks.
Why do you have a go back at her?
Well I went in and I says where's me cup?
And Fred said see, I told you you'd got to tell her.
I took off.
I says where's me cup?
She says I threw it at him.
Why didn't she throw her own?
That's what I says, that went an'all apparently.
What about his?
That went an'all.
Cos I'd been there that morning
Oh well.
and er my cup were out, her cup, Ev's cup and  Fred's cup
So all four went?
Aye, she were washing them or summat and he were annoying her so she threw them all.
And she phoned me up and says what are you doing?
I says nowt, she says good I'm coming.
Every time she gets arsey now she comes down here.
Oh well.
I thought she were gonna stab me with screwdriver today.
Which screwdriver?
Yours on table.
Thought bloody hell.
Tormenting  you know how she torments, says yeah you can do it then you can't, then you can, then you can't?
Yeah.
Well when she come in I asked her if we could tape  so she says yeah course you can.
Then she decided to be awkward, like she always is, and said  I says oh it's still taping you know and I s she said summat, I can't remember what it were now but I was saying, I knew that'd happen, one minute yes then no, then I'll think about it, I says and if I didn't start it when you went out you'd be saying you could've done this and that  and er so she were  chittering , pretending she said I couldn't  do it.
She said I could and then she were messing about you see.
And then I went and showed her all forms, all these form things that they've got  I were letting her read it.
And 
What form things?
These that are in this bag.
And 
I haven't seen them.
Haven't you seen them?
That's what I've got  
I don't get shown owt like that.
Oh well, you know.
All I do is get mike shoved under me nose.
It's not under your nose!
No it's under me 
don't tell lies.
no it's under me arse  farts .
Anyway er  it were what you write down, you're supposed to write who you've been talking to, tt what the occupation is  er you, how old they are, female, male  regional accent and that's, if you were born in London that's your accent you're using int it?
Och aye the noo  Geordies.
Oh well I don't know.
Aye all that jazz, and er
You couldn't tell whether a Geordie's frigging Irish or Scottish.
Well if I know who they are and I don't know where they come from  I'll just put who they are  day I were talking to them and dash it.
I can't fill all answers in I only 
Why not?
I only fill them in that I know for a fact.
Cos sometimes they won't tell you.
That's, well if you're going to J J's Saturday
Yeah she filled 
tape it.
about ten in.
Aye a load of garbage.
Yeah.
Well if you've got a cross-section of
I were telling you about Irene, I were filling this thing in and I put right, sixty four  I were gonna put sixty four, that were it.
So she didn't want sixty four putting down, she wanted twenty one plus putting down.
 
So what I did is I  writ thirty plus thirty four, adding up to sixty four and she  jumped up and she's grabbing thing off table and she had hold of the screwdriver and I says to Linda  thought she was gonna stab me with screwdriver  and she weren't, she were looking for a pencil so she could rub it out, well she couldn't and she found this pencil and she scribbled thirty four out.
So it says thirty plus now even though she's sixty four.
The cheeky sod.
Yeah that's exactly what she did.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Linda were going in hysterics.
What did she have to say?
Nowt much, just fetched her club money up, had a pratt about  all about family and that, different things.

Or he'll end up giving it away as a present, there's nowt wrong with box, car, nothing.
He'll save it for his own.
Well that's it.
If he gets  gotta get a bird first.

He's done these ones.
Well they, are they not silvery then?
Well he washed this one first and then he went over there and er then it dawned on him that the ends pull off   
Ah!

So she's got loads.
Yeah so she's got a lot of money.
Anyway she left twelve pence on the floor and Gary says whose is this money, said you leave it there, it's for Enid's  no nobody touch this chuffing twelve pence.
She left twelve pence on floor and what?
She left twelve pence on the floor and Bill put it in the cubby hole in the fireplace  and Gary says whose is this money and Arthur was going to pick it up an'all, he says leave that he says that's for Enid's money.

You've gotta go over it all.
Oh I don't know.
I've gotta ring anyway, nine sixteen 
You've gotta d 
twenties  thirties, forties.
Is that the eldest is the forties?
No Irene's the eldest the crafty bleeder.
That's what I'm looking for, I'm hoping she's rubbed it out in pencil.
She scribbled it out.
She doesn't, she didn't mind taping or owt, she were pretending that 
Yeah.
she said  cos she were talking, she knew tape were still running and she were pretending to say that she didn't say I could do it but she did
Mm.
erm what she were arguing with me  about  is her age.
Now she's sixty four
Yeah.
so she didn't want me to put sixty four down, but that's cheating
Mm.
cos if you know the age you're supposed to put the age down
Mm.
cos some people'll tell you and some people won't.
So I put sixty four down so  well I didn't put sixty four, I put thirty plus thirty four
Yeah, sixty four.
so that made sixty four.
So she jumped up, grabbed the pencil and everything, she got a screwdriver first,I thought she were gonna stab me with screwdriver  and she were looking for a pencil
erm but luckily she's rubbed it out with thingy so 
You're putting it back in.
I'm putting it back in.

You can stick batteries in it, I prefer them with batteries.
At least if battery goes out 
You mean if electric goes off?

Mm.
That was supposed to be battery back-up system, the one I threw on floor.
Cos I dismantled it  and threw it on floor .
Tt I got right mad.
It's a good job I've got two.
So I shall have one of them I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There you are.
I'll turn this tape off now, let you listen to yoursen.
Oh God 
I'll have this one Ted.
Looks a good'un, futuristic one 
Mm.
Steve likes them.
You buying this duck?
Yeah please.
I've got, I, I had a rough idea of what he'd got and what he hadn't now.
Ah.
I'm getting there.
I'm doing well so far, I haven't fetched one back have I?
No.
That must be good.
It is.
See a few of them, you know right at beginning where it shows you preface?
Yeah.
That's where it's jumped, not on the film itself.
Yeah you know why, it's, it's because of cont continuous rewinding.
You always get damage at front of tape.
Best thing to do is just cut it off.
Ah we will do later cos 
Well or yeah.
he uses  cuts it all off and gets rid of it.
Yeah it's erm  any damage on tape, nine out of ten times i is the first foot  it's because when they wind them back i it, it's a jag
tight innit?
complete jag all the time when they wind them back.
Yeah.
Aye well that doesn't bother us.
No.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta love.
shorts and  so I thought right, clean or mucky, you're in the wash.
So , thought I'll get them all washed and put back in bedroom before he notices they're missing.
So that's what I did.
Now what we're on about   yeah as I were on about, that er  what I do is, with days like this, cos you can never guarantee  if they're gonna be dry, wet or what, so I watch to see if it rains, if it don't  they're virtually dry when I fetch them in.
So that's what I've been doing.
I don't know whose T-shirt's whose.
That one's mine.
So that's what I've been doing.
I fetch them all in, stick them on clothes horse, they're all round fire while I'm on lollipop and then nip to shop and when I come in within half an hour they were bone dry.
Easy.
That's one way to do it innit?
Fetch them in at half past three.
But if they're dry I just fold them up and put them away anyway.
I'm just transferring socks.
So, how come you managed to sleep in again?
I didn't sleep in, I were up .
You were up?
breakfast and cup of coffee, I just didn't 
You didn't?
I didn't fe I felt wide awake but I was tired
Yeah.
So you thought  nah I'm not going, I'm stopping at home.
Third time that's been in the washer since Christmas day.
And that's only cos last twice I've  thinked of it.
Where is his lordship anyway?
I haven't the foggiest idea.
I don't keep track any more, I let him get on with it.
It's easier.
How come Dave's home?
What?
How come Dave's home?
I thought you says he were working  on them  mate's car?
Which one?
Mate's car.
Oh he's finished doing, they've finished doing that one.
Oh.
Yeah when did they finish that?
Monday I think, he's got ano the bloke's been sacked an'all, he's got another one to do.
Ah well that's not too bad.
It keeps him from getting bored.
Dunnit?
Yeah.
Socks.
Oh I'm doing well, I've got one odd sock so far.
Brill.
Stephen 
Oh he's gone back to J J.
I told you he went back to J J did I?
Yeah.

Oh aye it don't bother me.
Hey?
I give up on them.
I give up on them all.
I sent him to doctors.
He come in, his eye's right out here, and it's streaming with water  and he says he's been to hospital, they dripped some water in it, washed it out  must be mine that, what do you reckon?
It is.
Oh.
I can never tell cos he pinches them all.
If it's a T- shirt it's his.
So he says.
Anyway it was streaming with water so er  I told him to get down to doctors, he asked if, that's why I said oh Stephen's been back.
It must've been while I was stood up there.
And he's er what you called it?
Er  went to nurse so I lent him bike.
It's a bit dangerous driving round if his eyes are like that.
Well mine's got a visor and everything on it.
One of them  comes right down there.
So  Just airing these off.
That's what they're like when I fetch them in,it's not bad is it?

Well that says  a right lot that does .
All I know there's a mucky end and another end.
Aye 
Oh well that's not bad.
I just needed a day's recovery.
They'll say every time she's on days she doesn't turn up.
I rang up.
Have you rung up already?
Yeah.
Can't say owt if you 
Tt.
What you tell them?
Slept in?
Told them I had migraine.
Tt.
I'm running out of fucking excuses now, I'm going to write book out.
You'll have to remember what you've used.
Your grandma's dead four times.
Poor old grandma .
I'm a rotten bastard aren't I?
No.
Everybody does it.
You're not on your own.
I tell you summat  I'm getting fed up because every time I don't feel absolutely great, and I go over there and say will you stand in for me, I don't feel well, I don't want to.
It was an arrangement we had I, I wouldn't phone in  cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages  if I phone in.
So I says I wouldn't phone in, I'd let you know and you could do it and I'll pay you myself, I don't mind, you know, losing a day's pay.
I said I'll pay you mysen.
So er  she says yeah fair enough then she won't have to wait three week, cos it's only me that's losing, not her.
Yeah.
Anyway she's been going out on and off for quite a while now.
So I thought well I don't have to wait three weeks for mine so  next time I don't feel great  I'm gonna call in and take a couple of days off.
According to them I have had four weeks off in ten years.
That's it.
That's all I've had off.
No I'm lying, four weeks in nine years.
Why's she looking at excuses not to do it like?
Er apparently they phone her up or summat and ask her if she'll go and stand in for other people and she turned round and says if I can't have this school I'm not doing any.
That's what she's been doing.
So
they've not, yeah, they've not phoned her up for God knows how long.
Irene's been doing it.
Cos Irene says give me a ring I says no, I says that's it, I said I've already made the arrangement once and it backfired I says so I'm not doing it no more.
I says when I'm not feeling well or slept in I says I'm gonna phone police station, I'm gonna go from there, see what they say.
Let them find somebody.
I says I'm not messing about no more.
Do you know everybody's had flu and God knows what and I can't catch it.
I thought I had it again other day, I felt bleeding awful.
I had that at Christmas which made me bad all over Christmas  right ?
And everybody , I says marvellous cos I can have some time off,, it's not fair.
I'm not having that, that's cheating.
If they can have some time off I can have some time off, fair's fair.
It dries right quick, it just takes that chill off 
Kath you've got alarms all over the bleeding place, what are you up to?

Did you send another bill?
Yeah.
No i I phoned insurance up and told them what they'd said, cos I got Maggie to phone, it were Maggie that said, they told Maggie that they were gonna put a second hand wheel on and everything instead of a brand new one so she told insurance  about it .
They went mad, they told us that we'd got to take it to National Tyres, took it there, twenty three pound fifty it cost us.
What's that for, tracking?
Tracking and balancing it, none of it were done.
They had to do the lot so they give us an invoice, we took it in to insurance and they're gonna write a cheque, deduct it off that thing

Cos they should've done it.
Send you cheque back?

Oh you're gonna pay  
Anything to do with the crash, we don't pay nothing for it.
So everything that we've got to pay out we invoice them

Just for our Craigy, I had an orange one and er another colour one  and the orange one ran out the other day and he went potty.

You end up sitting on it.
And I'm sure that's what's doing it.
It's about five I've done in in two days.

I couldn't get over it.
I still can't believe it actually.
But she phoned up once at our house  is Steve there?

But I couldn't stop laughing, me .
Has he phoned up since he's gone?

Pine, yeah.
That's nice that one.
That pink one's horrible.
It's with Steve getting a bath every day and Stephen, both of them's nicked it.
Mm.
Well I've done another load of washing if you wanted to count how many units I've used.
You still doing that?
more money.
Oh.
It was nine point seven yesterday.
I'm doing well.
On a Sunday and a Saturday, Saturday's me worst day he reckons.
Well Saturday is your worst day cos we have telly on till twelve o'clock at night.
Yeah, we have telly on and I er I'm cooking and doing things in the kitchen, there's more cups of teas and everything.
And Saturdays I use thirteen point something weren't it?
Yeah.
So it averages out about eleven units.
A day?
A day.
Is that including your heater?
Everything.
Er n what heater?
When we put the immersion on it were only that thirteen weren't it?
Yeah well  
 
that bugger.
I've had  
It's alright for ha put it on for half hour maybe, you know, but you forget it 
If we've got no coal.
you forget it and it stays on four bloody days.
Yeah.
And that's no good.
Costs too much that.
Mm.
What I'll do is get a little light  run down then you can see
Yeah.
if light's on then you can tell oh immersion's on.
And turn it off.
Instead of going upstairs all the bloody time to look.
Yeah ours is in airing , you've got to bend down and look at it to see if light's on.
It's stupid.
Olwen has hers on for half an hour of a morning, Joe puts it on at half eight and dead on nine o'clock that immersion's turned off.
Yeah that's okay  like when summer time comes and you don't want a fire
Yeah.
cos you're saving on the coal then   we're  you know  
Yeah.
  

Didn't you tell him?
What?
coalman in street.
Oh now she even had him on  on something didn't you?
That Ken  fella  the coalman.
The different coalman.
He were parked up there well every coalman I've pulled him about this coke stuff  and I'd seen him other day and I pulled him, explained that I were going over on April first
Mm.
how much it is and he starts at five pound a bag.
Oh we'll have his then.
We'll find out 
Yeah Ken  he's called.
What day was it?
Er  today.
Friday weren't it?
Can't remember what day it was.
I mean if we tried one bag of that for a fiver.
cos a  man called and I caught him instead.
Mm.
So it's  in a minute  I should see him 
Can we afford a bag  this week?
At a fiver!
Well we pay that for the other coal.
You pay five twenty five for that bloody 
Well we could just get one bag and that 
coke.
and see if it  
It's not April yet.
You can see what it looks like.
See what it's like.
You've got to remember, you know when your fire's lit?
I don't want to see what it looks like.
You know when your fire's lit?
Yeah .
Once it's lit with that stuff you're supposed to shut your bottom all tight.
Waste of time with ours, it wants bloody cementing in.
Well  it wants a new grate.
Well it's not the grate, it's the  I think when we've cemented it together  it wants a bigger fireplace for that 
Yeah.
for that boiler
Eighteen inch.
I think that is an eighteen 
Well that's a fourteen inch  grate, fire  a fourteen inch grate but you've got the gap all round it like so I thought eighteen inch.
I went to  bloke there didn't I?
Yeah.
At er Wingfield Road and I said to them, I mentioned to them  
 
fourteen inch that way.
He says that's what you want but I said yeah but there ain't no bloody fit I reckon it ought to be them on legs maybe.
Yeah, could be.
You know
Have you tried a sixteen?
Wonder if we've still got ours.
I'll have a root in garage cos ours, you know when we had ours ripped out, Steve stuffs everything in garage and shed, and it had legs on, I'll have a look, that's a sixteen inch.
See if I can find it.
Cos you're an eighteen inch aren't you?
Yeah we went from sixteen to eighteen.
What's that?
What's that?
Fourteen or sixteen?
It's only little, it's little compared to Kath's.
Mine's ginormous.
We can put a bucket on and it fills ours up, she can put a bucket on and it's flat.
Can't you?
Costs a fortune.
I just got me coal and I was looking solvent  and I've only got so many weeks and I've got to empty the stupid thing again.
I shouldn't bother I should just carry on chucking a bit on here and there same as everybody does, I can't see many buggers  go for that bloody eight pound a bag.
Ooh I can't.
They'll all be buying briquettes.
Briquettes.
They're called briquettes.
Briquettes.
Yeah briquettes.
Yeah, five pound a bag.
It ranges from five to eight pound fifty.
Briquettes   who's are they, briquettes?
It looks like coal.
Er
Thruppenny bits.
How much  how much did I tell you them briquettes were?
I can't remember Bill.
But he, that other bloke, he said they were briquettes for eight pound thirty didn't he?
Yeah.
Yeah
coalman.
yeah I told you a couple of weeks ago.
Geoff were telling me  
I can remember you telling her.
Oh yeah.
coalman?
I don't know, all I know is  
Geoff was on about getting briquettes he said which were ever so cheap.
I asked him er about them and he says his mate always uses them and he says they're right good.
Yeah, they burn like hell do they?
Yeah.
Erm
If you've got any left in top you use it to light again.
Yeah Geoff was saying something, bloody hell  make it last longer cos I was telling you I says ooh not Coalite it's briquettes he said
Yeah.
but I don't know if that was five pound a bag, I think that was cheaper than five pound a bag.
Ooh.
Cos every time I spot a coalman I pull them.
Pour that in there Bill,
Stop smoking then.
I haven't hardly smoked at all today.
Told you last night   smoked like hell yesterday afternoon, she coughed her bloody heart up last night.
Yeah.
She's done the same again now.
You better sleep down here I tell you.
You won't let me !
I will.
I think he's tired .
That's the only thing wrong with Nettos, they don't sell cigs and baccy and stuff do they?
I've never noticed.
It weren't no cheaper if they did were it?
Garage is as cheap as anybody here for fags.
I reckon they must be buying them knocked off.
Well everybody else is four forty six for half ounce of Old Virginia.
Her's is one forty two innit?
Yeah  has always been cheaper.
How come the garage sells it cheaper?
Well they buy it in bulk don't they?
Gateways must do, places like that but 
Well theirs are cheap.
Only one  
Yeah but 
I paid for mine.
yeah, not as cheap as garage.
It were.
Course the garage has gone up then.
All cigs in garage has gone up.
Have they?
They went up other week didn't they?
Yeah all fags went up.
I haven't been there for oh I'm always going down there for petrol now.
You went to  for your petrol.
Well I've gotta fill tank up again now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
 

It don't last for long.
Oh dear .
I did well, I had hundred pound in me purse last night till Steve says can I have me pocket money and can I have me petrol and can I have this  and I paid for coal and I've got forty.
I thought God I haven't even got shopping yet.
Then Access arrived, I thought bloody hell.
Why don't you come to Nettos with us Kath?
I didn't fetch  money for it.
He's gotta go and get the money first.
I only want cigs  and 
Oh.
I didn't see any of that in there.
I got mine on Monday didn't I?
Oh yeah.
Didn't she get flabbergasted?
She couldn't believe it.
She had a panic.
Whatsername took us to   right, Alice  and Kath didn't realize that you couldn't write a cheque, did you?
No.
So she says give us your twenty quid, cos she only had a few bits didn't she?
Yeah.
She didn there would've been enough change in that and Kath was gonna go straight to the bank and get her some money back, right?
Anyway, oh no let me get me mine first!
And she got right flummoxed didn't she?
I says here Kath
So I got it off Maggie and I went and got yours back, fetched it back over didn't I?
Mm.
I've never heard of not being able to pay by, you can't, it was cheque, Access, nowt.
Well it says on there, big notices  that shows you 
Oh I've never noticed.
that's why they keep the price low.
I didn't notice that before.
Cos every cheque they get and gotta put in it costs them money.
Oh.
So  just cash and  it's like a cash and carry innit?
It is yeah.
Cheap er cheaper stuff.
Well them dog biscuits, they're only a pound.
One forty six I paid 
Ninety nine pence wasn't they, for him?
Where did I get them other ones from then?
Gateways, one forty six.
Well I got me shopping and it cost me  forty summat one.
No it's not Gateways , them two tins,no  .
One forty six them other things, and he don't like them.
Well he's not that struck on them.
Well he's got two choices, he can either eat them or starve.
Well he ate them  mix the gravy in with the meat  steak  
You always say that and er and you don't.

He'll never starve.
Just  some egg chips and beans he'll be  
He sleeps all day now though.
You what?

Yeah.

Well he came upstairs this morning, got on the bed and he went  flop!
And his head went straight across me chest, I thought oh, oh it's made me chesty.
He didn't wanna move his bloody head.

He runs up the stairs quicker than what Bill can get up there.
Does he?
Yeah.
To fight for the space.
