The south east.

Two down the bottom.
All the same 
Arsenal was .
all the same side as the  Watford Gap aren't they?
I got Holland and Brussels right
I mean, Holland and Brussels
That's alright, I got all of them wrong as .
Oh.
What number, that was nineteen?
I don't think that's logical thing.
No.
Eighteen?
Ooh well done Carly.
Not too bad for 
Mm.
an indoor sales girl there.
Cor!
Oh that, even thought about that  
I'd rather have .
Is fine.
What was that, eighteen?
Seventeen?
Yeah.
Oh.
It's this neck of the woods I don't know.
I think I'll have a .
And London.
It's in these neck of 
 
of the woods is it?
Well my aunt got lost on, round here.
Well Ca , Cannock 
 
Luton, Wolverhampton
Yeah, that's where I got mixed up.
and Maidstone, yeah.
, do you ever go to .
Don't you got to , you got Wolverhampton one of yours have you?
Yeah I'm sure there is.
 
There's some of the things you know Carly put on there.
I had Cardiff didn't I?
I went and put Cardiff on .
Actually Manchester 
Don't sound so excited Carly.
But a Wolverhampton's not.
Erm, where were we down to?
Eighteen was you saying Phil?
Seventeen.
Sixteen?
Fifteen?
For a southerner not too bad.
I had something
Fourteen?
Thirteen?
Ooh ooh!
We've got lower than fifty percent now.
Yeah , if it makes you feel better now they'd have only, cos Janey's was there?
The rest of them still to go.
I know, it's not too bad.
Twelve.
Ha!
Ten.
I had eleven.
 
Just over half .That's okay.
I'll save you going any further, I got below ten.
I choose not to disclose.
I make no excuses.
My geography's terrible.
I'd
Eleven?
Ten?
Nine?
Nope.
Eight?
Seven?
Six?
Five?
Four?
Also I had, put  more than that.
I got eight.
Eight.
Eight.
Seven?
Yeah, seven.
Seven.
Mm mm.
Yeah, seven.
Six?
No.
You need to look 
Ah yeah.
you cannot talk about moving parcels around the country if you don't know where the towns are.
You don't have to visit all those you didn't get
Oh yeah.
I think, in their own time at their own expense.
That's right.
Yeah.
I just get my bunches of three the wrong way round because I know where they are.
I think  before we go.
I know the Midlands is in the middle and  the south is in the south and
Not to your customers 
Might be some 
it isn't.
Not 
Well 
your customers 
What's wrong?
Well I know the north is in the north and the south is in the south 
 
I just don't know where the towns are that go with them.
I know the numbers of the depot.
No.
You do need to get 
That's what we need to get 
very, very, you should have a national map in front of you.
And not just  you don't want just our depots, you want them in relation 
That's the thing you see the 
to their customers there.
a lot of them places yo , they're not sort of like famous are they?
You know  Byfleet and Hornsea and 
They are to us.
Yeah they are to us but 
They're extremely famous to us Justin.
 
Manchester 
 
was a nobody until we put a depot in it.
Hornsea is famous Justin.
No, I don't mean that, I mean  yo , it's not a popular,yo like a
To start looking for Cannock  
Just because Byfleet 
on Saturday  
Byfleet doesn't have a premiere football team doesn't mean to say 
No.
it's not famous.
No.
Aye.
Cannock is famous for 
Tottenham.
your
Can I just say that 
 
the Manchester depot, actually in Manchester 
Yeah.
Hornsea beat Tottenham.
it's in Stockport.
It's in Stockport.
Yeah, it's not even in Manchester.
I know.
But you're right.
So now the south east most of those depots that you're looking at  Cannock isn't in Cannock.
No.
So, what I'm saying is they're just th , they're, they're, it's just for er
The biggest place near it.
the biggest place near it.
Now what 
 
I'm saying is, is you ought to get very close to that geographical map  because  it's the logistic  logistics er  difficulty with getting, and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that, in South Wales they can't just go across country, they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again.
Cos we're driving lorries, we're not driving little, you know  trial bikes that go over mountains like the Brecons and stuff, you have to 
But we do use the sheep in some ways don't we?
That's right, that's right, we do use the sheep .
But not for 
No.
the sake of the .
No, right.
What 
what I'm saying is, you know, you can't go from Stirling to Aberdeen  in a couple of minutes.
That's big country up there.
And so there's a big mountain range running up the middle of the country, someone thought once was the English Channel.
Well that's okay cos we've got a tunnel now.
Yeah, we got a tunnel now.
Yeah.
The English Channel, not the Pennines.
But they're going where's the Pennines?
 
Erm what I'm saying is 
I'd say I don't know where it is at all.
I am saying to you now folks become familiar with the erm  depots.
Now what about the depot numbers?
No idea.
No.
Forty nine.
Not at all.
Forty six.
Forty nine.
I'm gonna call them out.
Write them onto your sheets.
Aberdeen, thirty nine.
Yep.
And you have corrected your sheets haven't you?
You've got all the right ones next to the  
Mandy's put them on a nice new sheet ain't ya?

Sorry, but I'm going up it's the er 
Southampton's nearly up there.
Bristol?
Twenty on , twenty two?
Well done.?
Thirty two.
Milton.
Twenty one.
Cos I'm just 
How come you know them all by number but you don't know where they are?
I've dialled them that's why .
Worcester?
Twenty three.
What's happened to Milton?
I missed that as well?
Twenty one.
Twenty one.
Milton.
You missed that as well ain't you?
Twenty one.
Did I call it out?
Sorry.
Yeah.
Milton, twenty one.
My fault I think.
Don't get, oh Mandy's getting her hair off here!
I keep losing numbers.
Oh my God!
I've lost it!
I've lost the country now, lost the numbers.
 
Worcester?
Twenty four?
Se se , twenty seven.
Birmingham?
Yo!
Double O five.
Double O five.
Cannock?
Thirty four.
Double O
Double O
Thirty five.
 
Double O five.
What was Birmingham?
Double O five.
Say that again.
O O five.
Why?
Why has it funny number?
Cos it one of the new places.
Cos they're all funny numbers Mandy.
Cos it's twice as .
Ah right!
Just don't worry about it.
You couldn't get double O seven.
Deeside.
Where's Cannock?
I missed that as well.
Thirty four.
The man in the back  says so.
Deeside, forty seven.
Mm mm!
Manchester?
Forty nine.
Forty nine.
Forty nine.
That was the last,, I should have been market trader, been shouting out that voice and
That's, well 
He's like Chubby  int he?
Ramsbottom?
Thirty.
Belfast?
Thirty five.
Erm
On Belfast I've been told, and and my oversight, beg your pardon, that erm  I mentioned the four regional 
The branch that .
managers.
Because of the nature of that, that 
 
being across to water
sorry, Phil, are you alright?
It's alright.
Don't worry, I did go at a pace.
Because
Okay.
I talked about four regional managers, they were mainland U K.
Er, Brian , is also a regional director for Belfast and the serving areas of Belfast as well, okay?
He has sole responsibility for Belfast, but he does have regional directors going to  but Brian tends to cover a general manager role and  with  with erm  Dick ma ,.
No, not Dick , who's in er  Belfast?
Tom, Tom .
Yeah.
And er  himself, run the Belfast operation  across all the regions.
But sometimes, because he doesn't have hundreds of depots I think he's not regional, but that's my own fault.
Brian  is the Northern Ireland region.
Well done.
Do get a, er buy a map, spend some money to get one.
You may have in your depot  you may have in your depot a map which  have pinpointed the T N T depots.
Does any, has anybody seen one yet?
Yeah.
The big wa waterproof one which you can draw on?
Yes.
Yeah.
They're, er, well they're not waterproof
Well
but they're coated aren't they?
Er, so you can wipe them clean if er, you use a special pen.
But, what I'm saying is, if you, salesmen particularly get one, you'll need one to get round the country  your patch, but you need to get familiar with the towns up and down the country  for deli , for delivery, cos your customers will talk about the area and you're talking to someone from a transport café, you haven't got a clue where the towns are.
I mean, you know, where's your credibility?
And write down erm  it.
I know north of border, nothing happens south of the border and like but, but we do deliver down here so  do, do give yourself a little practise of that.
Now  I'm going to ask you to do another little test for me.
Simple questions, ten questions, alright?
Do you want ta , tidy up your little bit of paper out the way again?
And there's ten questions about the conditions of carriage.
Name on the top of the list.
Now  how many people have not seen a list of the 
 
carriage yet?
Er erm
Nobody.
I think I have not.
You haven't Paul?
I don't think so.
It's the  of the company and fax it.
I'll look in mine tomorrow.
You think you have?
 
See 
if I don't know by now 
see how you do.
We won't, it's just 
 
a very casual sale.
Well I'm not.
Just think, use your options.
This is so , you know so many days 
Yes.
Yeah.
Just use different options.
Alright?
Better put your name at the top of the page as well.
We'll go through the answers anyway.
Instead of just spouting at me, I'd just like you all to engage brain with .
 

Do you do, I've got one wrong.
Alright, just  make some notes  and stuff that you've got already.
Right.
I got lost .
  

What happens in  is you do have the people in that area  in the first few weeks .
.
The customer is same there.
The same as in C.  
.
Finished?
Pass it to your neighbour and once again.
?
Well I've read a few of the , it's just a case of remembering  the precise details.
 
Cos I, I, know, I know it means roughly in common terms cos, I got a sister to interpret it.
 
finishing her law degree.
Alright.
Come round the corner 
 
and that
no it's not, it's pass, pass your one 
It's just remembering what's actually on the sheet.
and then it's mine one, pass it down to  
Is it pass it twice?
Yeah, pass it 
 
round again.
T N T .
Oh!
No I'll do like this.
Right.
 

Well se , see what you can do just now.
I can't specialize obviously.
But having well a regional, a regional visits every once every how many weeks.
Dunno.
Just until we come through.
Exactly right.
Yeah I know.
It's seven thirty.
Did you do that?
Yeah.
Well they, well er, no it's feet U K national 
Let me just da dish this out.
and it's
Do you want to score that for me?
centimetres for worldwide  and Euro.
Let's score the paper then we'll go through the er 
 
I'm sorry.
I got number one.
Ah?
I sa I said I got number one.
That's what I wrote but I thought, I didn't put that, it didn't  exactly right .
But still, if you , but definitely if you feel like that and it goes  
It's the T N T Express.
I don't think it was right.
It is!
I could be wrong.
Look!
There!
Oh.
This is the trouble isn't it?
But some are good, especially  .
Kathy, is it 
You might be buying more.
Have you just got to sort of like the, these open to interpretation, or has it got to be word for word?
Well we'll go through it 
Giving us the answers now?
because, don't 
Yeah.
Good one.
do a tick and a cross if you, interpret it, interpret it the way you want to.
If, if you think, hang on 
 
that doesn't sound right we'll discuss the answer as we go round and  we'll have a group
I've got the questions wrong here.
Have another go then.
There yours, take those.
What's that?
Give me a paper please?
Mm.
Yeah, that must definitely be right.
It's up there?
Yes.
Right.
Is that
Well, it's a .
If you're , I think there's only two wrong here.
Just
That's right.
pick what you think is right.
 
If it sounds right then put it up and we'll discuss anyway.
 
Alright.
Ha?
Mm mm.
You still add a mark if you put then, would you give us the same mark as before?
Oh you've got to have that on as well?
Well it's just a legal
I think so
That's a good idea actually Phil.
Oh I'll tick that right, I don't care.
That's right.
Mm.
Did you tick that?
Mm mm.
Mm mm.
I give half for your number four by the way.
I meant a fifteenth of the following 
I'd be, I, I'd be inclined to give a half.
I meant the following month 
A half for one .
but know why I did.
I'm not gonna give him that , I'm gonna give you half.
I'm sorry I can't give you that.
Got a half of what .
Got to be strict.
It's not very good.
Once you done the fifteenth 
, I bought you one.
that's all  
What was this?
going to.
Definite.
Well you give me one.
Yeah you need, you need one.
So would I .
Give half for that one.
There are some which is distributed, things distributed by a carrier 
?
Say that to me again, Phil.
There are some which is to be distributed by a carrier.
I'd say no, so he's right.
Definition of a consignment?
Yeah.
Well 
I will accept that sort of answer.
It is , the, this specific thing about it is from 
Yeah.
one place to another thing.
The one time, one load.
Classified being a consignment.
 
from one address to another if is the important thing.
Yeah, plus it was  
The important fact was covered in that .
Who's got that?
I'll give you that.
Oh yeah.
So the , no two labels showing destination 
I could give people the last part , be careful in the second one.
 
  
Okay let's discuss the, let's discuss the answers 
Yeah.
Let's discuss the answers.
Where's there's any discret 
Ooh!
discrepancy, I wish I could take the dog's teeth out 
You should be able to know them all 
and put my own in.
Let's see if we can clear up any discrepancy.
 
What is the legal title of the company?
Did anybody get it technically correct?
It isn't just T N T.
John?
U K. 
No.
Didn't get the question together.
How many got the first one right?
T N T Express U K 
John did.
Ltd.
Yeah.
Wo oh!
No , I put, I put 
Yeah, Janey did.
carrier.
Well what have you got in?
You put the word the carrier?
I just put carrier cos
We , I understand what you're saying because yo , that's what it's used erm 
I'm looking, I'm from sort of like 
in the conditions.
a legal point of view.
Yeah.
I understand what you mean.
Danny's point is valid there because when you're reading a legal document, T, the T N T Express U K will hereafter be known as the carrier 
Carrier.
he's put, so we wrote 
So really that's saying the title
Yeah, the legal 
actually.
title it does say.
But I was just gonna say, it's understandable
Mm.
him thinking in terms and conditions of carriage.
Yeah.
Yo , you wouldn't have just put the carrier normally would you?
That's what I'm saying, so  er, just er interpretation of the question slightly misleading there.
Right.
No worries.
What is a definition of a consignment?
Now if you get these right, word for word  you'll be er, I do conditions of carriage quizzes on selling skills courses  and the amount of people that get this right I can count on one hand in the last three years.
Who got it right?
David.
Word for word?
What was the bit you did?
Not word for word, now 
What did he say, please?
He said, one or more items to one address.
No, not comp 
No?
No.
not complete.
What was the completed 
Andy 
bit?
So did I Phil.
That's not right.
Andy's got it right.
Oh!
Er er, parcels, a number of 
package goods 
parcels packaged then together
That's what it means
and carriage
but it's not the same.
That's not the exact, not it either.
Collect the packaged goods to be transferred from 
Oh I've got it.
one place to another
Oh stop it!
consignment as agreed.
No, that's not enough.
What's mine 
No 
then?
David is the 
no it's 
nearest one.
Parc the number of parcels.
that's what I put.
A parcel or goods, goods or a parcel, or a number of parcels from one address to another
At one time.
at one time
In one load.
in one load
in one load.
That's 
Aha!
i , those, those points are all valid.
If there's
I missed that.
a group of parcels going in two loads it's two 
I put  and I crossed it outside.
Two loads.
Consignments.
Consignments.
If it's going  erm
To different .
to two different 
I got that one.
addresses it's two consignments.
That's what I meant.
If it goes at different times, it's a different consignment.
So in, parcel or parcels, going from one address to another at one time in one load  that is a consignment.
If you just say  erm  a group of parcels  er er, in one load that's not enough  cos it can be 
Yeah I know.
part of a load.
I missed out the from address to address.
One address to one address.
It's 
Yeah.
quite er distinct what I di ,a what you'll be determined as.
Cos some people  er er  may think, you know, the agreement because I have split the load you can still charge me the same price and it may not be the case.
Right.
Next one.
What's the question  ja Andy?
What is the cus , sorry, what should 
What should 
the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
What was some of the answers there?
Janey's put, name, address, from another consignment note filled out and service requirement 
 
and weight of the consignment.
Yeah.
 
So what we were looking for was something more  er erm 
Did I answer that one?
No.
I didn't get round to it.
Anybody get what we were looking for in the, yes you should?
What should the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
Well obviously the delivery name and address is important and the consignments, so you didn't get that wrong but there was, what we were looking for  as well a full written declaration of the nature of contents of any consignment containing dangerous  infested, contaminated 
Aha.
or fragile goods.
In other words, is there anything, did anybody pick up
You got that.
Yeah,
unusual 
I did.
I might have given you one there, that looks good enough.
Oh.
Did you get that there?
I did a part of it.
Oh 
I reckon Justin's got enough cos 
What 
he's got  times 
Time 
when ready, weight, number of packages, destination, and then  haz 
Well done.
 Haz will do nicely for me.
That's what we're really looking for, hazardous 
Yeah.
goods.
Well done.
Because, how can I say 
Even, even I take 
we've, you'll see, I mean there's a, not a very good illustration of a, the hub with the yellow walls of the, the conveyer belt behind you, but you can see the fairly plain packaging that parcels come in.
The more, er er sophisticated erm  wholesale er  distributors now  know that people just pick up from stock a box don't they?
And, they may have one display displayed, but if you go to somewhere like a warehouse or distribution where you go round and pick up your  you can go to a garden you'll pick up a box that's illustrating a Flymo  lawn mower or something and, and it'll, er they spend a lot of time and money on the packaging, but, a lot of people for pilferage reasons don't illustrate and that's good practise not to illustrate, from our point of view, what's on the package.
But you must know what's in it.
Just knowing the size and the weight isn't, you might, that's alright, that's only for the price  what's in it is vital  because  if I asked the sales people  from their top ten major customers what do you carry for them?
Do reme , can yo , can I, can you guess at how many would say I don't know?
Major customers.
Half a dozen.
It's a lo , I, I'd sa , they wouldn't admit it Bill, they might say something like erm  oh it's electronics, but they wouldn't know specifically what electronic.
Would that not cause er security problems if you put exactly what was on the box.
You don't put , you shouldn't, but you should know.
You should declare it.
They should declare if it's hazardous, infectious, infested,i it will, what's word you used?
Incestuous weren't it?
Incestuous?
Was that a word.
Infested.
Infested, contaminated 
 
Yes it is.
or fragile goods.
Dangerous, haz really, he should declare it, and people don't you know, unless you ask.
Right.
Right.
Next one.
What is the customer obliged to provide da to load and unload a consignment?
Who di , who got the answer?
Not exact.
I, er I said suitable lifting or moving equipment.
I'd accept that.
Plant, power or labour.
Moving equipment then.
Yeah 
That's 
I got that one.
what I said to you.
Ah!
I got that.
Did you accept it Paul?
It got one.
Yeah.
Yeah, you did?
Yeah about  lifting equipment?
About power lifting equipment.
Yeah I'd accept that.
Cup of tea for the driver.
What we actually put
 
Cup of tea, sustenance , yeah.
What we actually put is, er, it is the responsibility in the conditions of carriage.
It is a responsibility.
Where would you find the conditions of carriage.
On the back of every erm  contract out there.
On the back of every contract.
Because  it is subject to the conditions of carriage  that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information.
Now, it is down to interpretation i er er and, it, on your next courses you may do a more in-depth conditions of carriage quiz which will ask you to study the conditions of carriage at night and produce a bit more detailed answer in the morning, but we're not gonna expect you to do that on this course.
Erm, number five erm  can you read that out for me Mandy?
What, sorry, go on.
Go on.
When would you cube a consignment?
What did you put Bill?
What did Bill put?
 
That's a very good answer then.
It's one I could think of.
Gets me out of trouble that one.
I got one.
Did anybody get that one right?
No well I, I 
I thought when the mass 
I sa er 
is greater than the weight.
You know 
Yes.
That's right.
Cos I put like 
I put
if you're taking six foot of film it won't weigh much but it'll take a lot of room up.
That's fairly accurate that.
I just put if you've got 
Oh you're having that one are you?
if you've got a load , if you 
It's a good point.
if you've got a er
More consignments on it.
dead we or  gross weight
Yes.
Well 
and the big package
that would have meant  
then it go in , in a large
That's correct.
dimensions then you cube it.
We're gonna do cubing in a minute, do a few exercises on cubing.
Yes, I mean,Je Mandy said er, if we've got any consignment which exceeds one point five cubic feet per ten kilos.
But you usually know don't you if 
It's lower than that actually but  er sorry 
Mm mm.
it isn't.
I, I said, yeah a cubic foot, is se , six point six then.
That's probably right, yeah.
One point five per ten kilos.
You can usually tell when you get used to it and we're gonna talk about visual identity in a minute, but  when the mass seems greater overly large to the weight is what  er Jen , sorry Mandy said, and I think that's a good  er er  a good er  analogy there.
I got if erm, if the size is greater than the weight actually.
Yes.
I got that.
I'll accept that at this stage alright?
Next question is, what's number six?
Who can read it out?
Er six .
Can't read that word.
Notional.
Oh!
Ha.
What notional weight is used for cubing?
Six point six per cubic foot.
Did you get that right?
I did, yes.
Mm mm.
Yes.
What notional weight?
Did anybody get that right other than, Dan?
Mm.
The man.
I, I put one, one 
Janey got it right.
ton per cu , well it's per cubic metre 
I know.
Yes.
because  in my last job that's 
Three feet.
how you worked it out, we didn't work with feet.
We worked in metres.
Getting you excited now Bill.
 
Yeah, well he does it all the time.
 
It's only twen , it's only twenty six point six two.
Is it?
Yes.
I dunno, I mean, I got 
A metre, no , it's not a ton.
And if you do a cubic metre, in my old 
Yeah but yo 
it was one, it was like one  one ton per cubic metre.
That's when you used to work in weight and measure though isn't it?
Yeah.
We do , plus a thousand 
They did 
kilos per metre squared?
Yeah, if you work on , is it, is it always on cubic feet or do you actually do it on metres?
Well
We always wo 
we tend to go back to feet I must say.
Yeah.
But I don't know why?
Unless it's Euro or international  and then it's in metres.
What are you refer , what are you referring to that one, that, what does that
That's for loading containers?
That's what you ship in .
Yeah that's for international you see.
Oh right.
It's a different one.
I didn't realize I was 
No.
international.
No.
It's not the same.
That's what containers do don't they?
They seal containers and export it to different er  ratio.
But the cubic idea is the same, but it's six point six  cu , kilos per cubic foot.
So a metre would be  about three  it's a cubic metre.
We'll work on that one.
Gotta be nine ,
Nine.
nine
Nine.
cubic metres in a 
metres 
yard.
About the same sa , in ten.
Mm.
It's about the same.
What I can't understand is 
Not a ton.
is why we mix, why we mix the measures.
Neither can I.
We've got kilos for the weight, and we've got cubic feet.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Terry do you wanna re-write the cu , the cubing manual?
Please.
Make it simpler.
Maybe then I'll get it right.
Make it simpler for the new babies coming in.
 
No you didn't, you got it wrong.
Oh right.
 
Er, seven.
To what extent is T N T liable for indirect or consequential loss?
I'd say we were 
Answer?
.
No.
Anybody get 
It's not.
it right?
Yes.
Yeah.
I got one of them.
And a show of hands.
Does everybody understand 
A lot of people.
what consequential loss is or indirect loss?
You lose the parcel but  it's end up for example in the, they used a contractor at the other end because we lost the parcel but they're not responsible for that.
We'll just take the blame for it.
If, yeah, we don't 
And erm 
insure documents anyway.
We don't er  offer transit liability on documents because we only  that is a flat piece of paper to us, it isn't a valuable item.
We don't con , the, you know, what the arrangement is.
Mm.
If it's your marriage contract and you don't get married because you don't got, that's not our fault.
We just  cos we don't ins , it's only a piece of paper to us, you see.
So documents do not get transit liability on them at all.
And tenders and deadlines can be particularly sensitive to that, but you cannot offer transit liability.
But even if this tape is going to record the last speech of  somebody famous and it didn't get and therefore they couldn't record it, that is co , the consequence of a delay, you know, a fall of snow or  our vehicle breaking down or something not being done, or missed some  in human, some human error, it's not our, we don't lay, we'll give, we'll insure or  offer transit liability on the value of the goods providing you've got additional full transit liability with us, but we won't for the loss of business because you didn't get it.
Is that, can anybody think of a, a courier  of documents, it's still the same.
I think that's why super mail offers  on large goods.
Mm.
It's better than one.
Mm.
Mhm.
Yes.
No we don't do ta , erm  the conditions of ca , there's, there's a slight sort of 
 
on conditions of carriage for the same day operation but, not in that league at all.
On super mail, if that item doesn't arrive in a set time
Mm mm.
what do you make up for, just their postage?
It might be more mightn't it?
The consignment or 
Yeah.
the nearest nearest service value.
If they send out a document that weighs a kilo for tapes and they sent that one, they're losing twenty 
It'll lose it's value 
rather than say if it doesn't arrive at a set time
That wouldn't make any difference.
then it's covered for them.
It's E
Just the consignments.
Class E. 
With post, yeah.
I'm talking about 
Yeah sorry 
If it, if it was like you 
 
say
Yeah.
if they us , if they use a contractor  
 
That's what they're, what we're saying.
You might, you might get 
And that sort of from the policy.
you might get it 
No.
for nothing.
Well er
Cos  but erm 
But they still go there now.
Yeah I know, but our sort of van 
What would it cost?
or
Like  
 
carrier like the local land owner at the House of Lords can do that.
 
I'll buy you a .
Yeah but, she didn't say these are all wrong once I look at 
Yeah.
the board.
Paper.
Most of them would cos they are going like far  
And everyone's  .
You've seen people see  
  
We only, we only insure 
I didn't say what the license is.
we only insure for the intrinsic value of 
And is there any situation 
the item.
That's all.
Right.
But you guarantee them delivery.
Yep.
On the piece of paper.
I know but you've lost the .
We give them their money back.
I mean, well it'll probably arrive, it'll turn up somewhere won't it really?
But se 
Could do.
I mean send another one is what we're saying, have your money back.
If you haven't got the  you should be okay.
Or
if it arrived, if you paid for a before 
One customer should expect it to arrive then 
noon  and it er 
 
I mean, same ta super mail, we wouldn't give them their money back.
I think that's a bit more than that now.
But if you ordered a ten thirty delivery and it arrived before noon, we would just give you the money difference the before twe , ten thirty and the before noon price, not the complete price.
Unless you wanted to argue about it.
But we feel that, okay, you know, it may have been a half an hour late but you got there.
And therefore, we have incurred cost and therefore, but okay, it wasn't the guaranteed service.
But you could argue with us, you know.
And again, a commercial decision is made locally based on the strength of the account.
But we don't, you've gotta be careful as you probably know Phil, the abuse can of the ca , you know, carrier, you know, can be a nice little earner if you're not careful.
And, you know, erm people can  intend to fail in order to claim money, revenue back, and so on.
D'ya know
Or damaged goods can, you know, put the foot through it to get the insurance cover on what we pay and we're liable.
So you've got to be very, very, very careful.
Having said that if you, there's been a court of law we'd prob , if, they'd probably erm
