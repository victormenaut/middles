Right.
Erm yeah I thought it was very good.
Very, very relaxed, very natural  erm went through the, the procedure.
Erm it was, it was good.
The greetings, we look at each part, the greetings and er appropriate sociability, that was good  didn't go on too long, friendly, two way, wasn't all one, one sided.
Erm you gave your business card, sorry you gave your buyer's guide first  and Steve raised an objection then about do you find it a problem only  selling for one company
Mhm.
you, you gave him an answer  but it, it didn't really I don't think sort of 
No.
in all honesty ans answer what he said, you more or less made a statement and said  yes I am er but I, I know all about the products and I'll give you best advice.
I think you could've, you could've  apacked that a bit, a bit more, to put in the er words of the day, to find out you know what was worrying him and, and what his problems were on that.
You, you know, you, you got over it but er he, he didn't re he didn't come back to you when perhaps he could've done  if he was feeling a bit er aggressive  at the time .
Erm you gave him your card, that was fine erm your link into referrals, that was good.
Erm  you did what I did actually Bill, you actually called them referrals and I think  I, I feel that we shouldn't call them referrals we should call them introductions, I think it, it's probably less confrontational
Okay, aha.
but erm the, the link was there and it was good.
Erm  your statement of purpose you, you er you, you gave over and at that point, you know, I've had a policy for thirteen years or whatever it is why, why I haven't seen somebody before  erm and again you, you gave an answer to that erm  which, which actually satisfied  there wasn't any, any comeback on it  erm you mentioned industry and so on and that was, that was, that was f that was okay.
Erm I didn't spot the tentative benefit, I don't think you actually got that bit as far as what was gonna be in it because when erm Steve came up with the why so long I think that, that took you off the track a bit.
Mhm.
Erm  tt you then moved into introduce the C C Q  and after you'd done that, then you got the, the willingness to proceed.
So you, you went sort of back the other way and alright it was, it was okay and, and er and there was no problems there because any, anything that came up with the C C Q you, you o you answered the questions there and went through.
Erm  the other parts that I made a note of, you didn't ac well you  Steve said the wife will be back in an hour and a half  erm you didn't pick up Bill any, anything on that at that stage as to whether she ought to be involved although when he started talking or when he couldn't remember the, the names of the or dates of birth of the children, he remembered the names, the dates of birth of the children, you mentioned the fact then that the wife would be back in a  in an hour
Mhm.
but I don't think you actually mentioned at any time you know the, the wife's involvement in it  other than that point.
She's only the wife.


Ooh!
I'll ignore that.
Erm  Steve was quite meticulous about the family names
Mhm.
erm er and the spelling of it, you, you asked, I think, about the, about the Bridgit side of it and so on and, and questioned that and then again later on picked up a bit about the er tt about the spelling of the children's names so you, you went along with him on, on that.
I don't know whether, whether it might've been worthwhile just questioning a bit more about the  the link because he was obviously very keen on it
Mhm.
but you, you, you know, you, you picked it up later on and more or less o overcame that.
Erm the education side  you picked up university and school fees.
Steve mentioned, you know, to put fifteen, twenty pounds a month into it  erm  and you said well we'll come back to that later  which I think on the face of it is probably er a right way of going about it cos you didn't get interrupted at that stage talking about a specific product so I think that was er that was good.
Erm one of the other things that, that was mentioned was the magazine  he'd seen, he'd seen, he'd seen the thing on 
Financial News actually.
 
about school er further education on, on the magazine and I felt that perhaps, bearing in mind what he'd said earlier about  I haven't had any contact with you for thirteen years, that might have been something that you could've you know reinforced a bit well we've now got financial advisers, the other thing or one of the other things we're doing is, is this contact magazine which we're sending out to policy holders  and it, you know, it helps to bridge the gap as it were.
Erm  I can't remember whether occupation or health c I think health comes next doesn't it?
Yeah.
He mentioned his back problem  you never really got to find out exactly what it was, he sort of glossed over it, he said oh I'm alright now.
You never really sort of said well was it, was it a slipped disc or is it gone or have you gotta go back for any more tests or anything like that er and bearing in mind that he also said he was keen on sports and he played tennis and so on, you could've had the opportunity there to say oh have your back problem, back troubles made in difference to you in that area?
Mm.
Erm  occupation  when you, you were talking about travel when, he'd told you what he was doing and he was associated with an American company or the parent company was in America  erm you mentioned about travel, Steve started talking about car and miles he drives and he also mentioned flying  but you never explored at all really the, the flying side.
You, you, you assumed that he was flying as a, as a fare paying passenger erm and when he started, when you s then started saying how many miles do you do Steve went straight back to talk about car travel.
Mhm.
So that the flying part never got mentioned at all, you know, whether he flies around in single engined planes.
He's got wings.
Pardon?
He's got wings.
He's got wings, yeah.
Well I know he's a clever chap.
Erm the salary part was good and you, you were getting all the other bits and pieces that went on, you got his basic salary and you started talking about other benefits and you were exploring those when we er, when we came to the, to the end.
As I say it, it was a good structure, very, very er  very relaxed, very good, good communication, it wasn't one way or the other.
As far as the actual  steps are concerned I say the on the on the one that you missed out was the tentative benefits statement, that got lost out because of erm tt the red herring that he threw in about why so long, but it do you know it does highlight that we've gotta try and get back on to it but oth you know, there was a lot of good things in it.
Fair enough.
Okay?
Joan Do you wanna have your er 
Yeah okay then.
your say.
My say.
I've actually got very little to actually pick you up on Bill because I think erm  I think you did very well
Mm.
erm
Most women find that.


So
Right, erm  I've actually got down that erm you assumed that his wife wasn't a tax pay sorry, his wife wasn't a tax payer and you assumed that she wasn't working but you did actually pick back up on that later that she wasn't  that she wasn't going back to work after having the children so erm tt  that is now irrelevant but it was at the time that you were saying it, that you didn't actually pick it up.
I actually got the impression that erm  I mean I'm not going to go over the, the points that 
Mm.
that Robert's already gone over, but I actually got the impression that erm I  that you didn't feel relaxed in what you were doing, you knew what you were talking about but erm you didn't feel relaxed and if I'd've been your customer then I, I certainly wouldn't have felt relaxed either and  and that's the impression that I got which was the completely opposite of Robert.
Erm  tt  er when it came to the children erm and he didn't know the date of birth erm you should've at least got the ages of them
Mhm.
and, and made a note of those.
Erm  tt  there's er  one point I would like to make, when I, when I made that comment about she's only the wife, and I'll just clarify why I said that and this is  it's amus a few years ago some, somebody who was, we were taking a policy out with   right  was, came to me and was, was talking and making arrangements to, to come and see us and he patronisingly said  erm and your husband'll be there, and I patronisingly said back, and you'll be bringing your wife,because of the way that he came across to me  and I, I mean 
Yeah, yeah I know I said that.
I don't think any of us have actually done that but that is  that was the reason for my sarcasm 
Yeah it's a, it's a good point.
Yes.
No, no I, I 
so er 
it was taken that way  
because because that is how I felt when he was actually saying that to me
Yeah.
you know?
Erm but er I'd just like to add that  that, that wasn't relating to Bill because he certainly didn't do that.
Erm  I wasn't, I didn't know what you were trying to get at when you were bringing up the miles per annum that he was doing, I can understand the flying side of it but driving in the car, yes you need to know that he's doing a lot of miles and that there's, you know,the there's the potential danger and everything there but I didn't understand why you need his specific miles per annum.
I don't know.
Erm I think that's about all that I can add to what Robert said.
Okay, fine.
Ron?
Well apart from those things  erm  tt when, when you were talking about the back erm Steve sort of gestured, in a way, that  yes my back was erm oh my back, yes, that's only a one off thing, there may have been some other health problem there which could've gone into.
I mean apart from that, yeah I mean you're marvellous
Mm.
Carry on.
there's no question about it, you were very good and I, I'm amazed I picked up these things.




Se no seriously I, I thought you were very good Bill, there's no question about it.
Erm  was the original or the existing business only done through the post?
Mm.
Er was, did anyone come round at any time?
Mhm.
Erm I know he's not seen anyone for thirteen years but did, did it just come through the post, sign here, send it back
Mhm.
you know or was there, you know is that other point, was, was there an intermediat yeah, someone else.
Mhm.
Erm tt  the flying bit, erm I was a bit unsure whether they actually flew the plane, he flew it, the partner flew it, whether they were paying or, or 
Whether they had wings.
what they were doing 
 
Well  
 
erm as, as I'm sure you picked up.
The bonus erm  he only got two and a half grand last year, is he expecting to get some this year and if so what does he normally do with the money.
Yeah, good point.
Erm
That's a good point actually.
and just  the, the part here, I mean this, this  I don't know if it's right or if it's wrong but when you said  I wanna put twenty quid towards my children's future  perhaps the way I would see is I, I would think twenty quid'll go nowhere for their future, it's gonna be a lot more expensive so as you're openly offering me to take the money off you for that I would have perhaps gone down to try and commit you towards that need  there and then to see how important it is  and then, because when I er eventually bring back erm the sort of agenda and say look it's gonna cost you a hundred and twenty quid a month  erm you're sort of sold on the idea.
I don't know if that would've been the right thing to do there.
See I, I personally in, in the past I would've jumped on it and gone for it.
I think it, it's wi Bill was wise not to pursue it.
Right.
I think his er the best thing to do would be simply to acknowledge at that stage, as Bill did, yeah that is an important area erm say yeah that's something we can help you on, indeed it's something many of my clients erm have found that Friends Provident is really very good at organizing, we've got plans specifically designed for that but rather than look at that now, let's look at the overall picture
Right okay.
to see if there are any other areas which may be even more important for us to address.
You happy with that?
Yeah.
And then move on.
Right.
So 
Check check his understanding and check  
yeah, so I wasn't sort of having a go, I just didn't know which way we at Friends Provident would go.
See in the past 
you'd walk out with business, you would walk out with business
Yeah.
but you probably would've missed other things.
Yeah.
Alright?
Right.
Finished?
Yeah.
Any other points?
No but as I say, you know
Okay.
Thanks Ron.
you're marvellous Bill.
Wait till I see what you or Steve has to say.
Steve  
Yeah erm  one thing, you were a little bit nervous to start with and what that can do is to give you a tendency to piggyback questions, is that something you're aware of?
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean by that?
You're going on er you're not listening to the answers, you're going too fast.
Not necessarily no, piggyback is where you asked, you asked me several questions and su and then either added another question to it or asked a question and gave an answer  and by doing that you are limiting my responses and I wasn't sure which an which question I was answering.
Does your wife do that or does somebody else do that, why not just ask me the question  who does the gardening
Mm.
Mm.
and zip up.
Ask the questions.
The danger is er you, you limit what I'm going to say to you.
So the easiest thing is just ask a question and say nothing, wait for the answer and then respond appropriately.
So that's one of the things er I picked up on.
Tt erm  with the F P mailshot er I think a good question to ask would've been why did you buy it, was there any reason behind it  are you happy with it  er when it came to referrals I mentioned the tennis club, something you could perhaps develop is, that's interesting, which club is that
Mhm.
oh yes it's the er West Worthing Club and do you have a regular, you know, partner you play with, is it er er a doubles match and who would  cos you're then sort of sounding out whether there's referral business in that one.
The thing about the business miles, you were right to ask me the business miles
Mhm.
absolutely cos, cos that's gonna, that'll come into any er underwriting
Mm.
if I do over X number of miles and of course the mileage I did was, was way in excess
Mhm.
of what would be normally considered, and in , of flying, again I, I thought what are you driving at?When you said miles I was thinking what, how many miles 
 
is it, how many miles is it that I fly to Turin and Zurich and  do you want me to try and add that up and then it was into the cars I thought oh this is an easier question to answer, I'll stick with the cars cos I know that I do twenty two thousand.
Mm.
Erm a and the, the person I was playing is a friend of mine, he does do a lot of flying
Mhm.
so of course that would've come out at a later stage, yeah, you know there's a lot of business miles involved in flying to all these er places.
Erm I thought you had a good structured call, you were focused on business, you obviously picked up on the buying side.
Er I thought you did well in erm giving yourself credibility by talking about the shares, oh yes you can have two hundred and fifty pounds per month in the shares and they've done well and I said oh yes they have done well, and I felt good that you were praising me up for being such a clever chap, and so I thought that was all, all jolly good stuff.
Mm.
Tt erm the magazine, a magazine's a good way of getting referrals  I can't remember who it is, somebody who er Ken I think it is, er uses the magazines as a great way of saying erm you've read that in the magazine, you've found it useful, tell me what about the chaps at Excon, who, who else would you work with who would find it useful to have a subscription, some kind of subscription, who, who should be placed on our mailing list.
Mm.
So you get referrals that way by using the magazine.
Tt erm and explore the salary a bit more because again I said it's basic at thirty five and there's a few other bits and pieces but you never really got to grips with what those other bits and pieces are, yeah there's performance related pay, location allowances, a company car, there's BUPA, all those bits and bobs need to be identified.
Mm.
That's er and that's it Mark.
Okay.
Very good.
Right, thanks very much Steve.
Erm I hones 
Bill?
honestly felt a wee bit nervous at the start just to make sure that I had the structure, that, that, I think that was the whole crux of the thing.
Er  you find in a one to one situation you become more relaxed because  you're conscious of being watched, you know what I mean?
Er the structure is there to, to be used.
That was, that was the only thing I, I thought well if I get off to the wrong start, you're off on the wrong start completely so yes I, I concede that I was nervous at the, at the beginning.
Erm I cl well  I, I'm looking for advice here, the wife is not there, do you say oh will she be joining me, joining us?
Do you do that right at the very beginning?
Oh you would  you would say oh nice to meet you Mr Brown, oh erm by the way will your wife be coming to join us because I'm sure she will find it most beneficial.
That's right.
She'll be, there'll be questions she'd want to ask which perhaps you, you may not er normally pick up on and ask and if it's well I'm afraid she's gone out shopping today say well that's a pity, I'd love to meet up with her.
Never mind, perhaps next time when we meet and hopefully we'll be meeting again in say a fortnight's time, erm we can set some time aside when you'll both be here cos I'm sure she'll be interested to hear what I've got to come back and talk about.
Mhm.
Right.
Fine.
Er I was, I was quite happy, I take the point er missing the points about the squash club, the tennis club because these are opportunities to get other names.
Erm tt whether that's appropriate, you know, I'm thinking of it as a first appointment just to get a general picture  whereas you might be coming back to stir his memory for referrals by saying er, you know, er you mentioned here you're a member of the squash club, do you remember I said I'd be looking for introductions, maybe we'll learn whether at the beginning of the second appointment you jog the memory there er you know in other words what I'm do doing is keeping that in my mind, that you are remembering the squash club or whatever club it may be and use that later, although I didn't er elaborate on it at that, that er  because I think you can go off at a tangent
Yeah I think 
at that point.
yeah I think the er what I, if, if it were me, I'm not saying this is the, you know, the way to do it, if it 
Mhm.
were me as it has been I'd say that's interesting, which club is that, oh it's the  
 
no the, I'd, I'd pursue it just a little bit further, spend a 
Aha.
Okay.
few more minutes and it might be oh it's the West Worthing Club, that's interesting some of my clients play there as well.
Who do you play with, oh I play with Joe Snooks and Fred Brown.
Really?
Erm how often do you play, oh once a week or a couple of times a week, what sort of standard is it and what it's doing is you've got an opportunity to sound off about yourself and that's who we are talking about isn't it?
Ourselves.
Mhm.
So you're feeling relaxed and comfortable and good because you're telling me, you know, what a great tennis player I am and I really enjoy it, you've just given me a couple of names that I'll either make a note of or I'll say that's interesting cos I actually deal with Joe on a business relationship anyway erm maybe we could meet some other people from the tennis club, self employed people, professional people such as yourself, who might be interested in looking at financial planning but today I'm more interested in talking about you Bill, erm we'll come back to them a bit later if I may so let's press on.
And what I've done is I've kind of just sown the seed
Yeah.
and moved on cos I don't wanna spend any more time on it but 
No.
I've just planted a seed that I know other people
Mhm.
like minded people.
By mentioning names you see are, are you not divulging customer confidentiality?
Erm I, I don't think I have a problem saying well actually I deal on er i if someone said erm if you said I play with Joe Snooks you'd say Joe Snooks, that's interesting Joe's a, a very good client of mine
Yeah.
I'm not gonna say you know that Joe's placed X amount with me.
Oh just say I know him quite well.
Yeah I knew Joe s yeah, I know Joe very well.
And that instantly brings, you start thinking oh he must be alright cos if Joe's done business with him 
If J if Joe knows him.
he's alright, he's an okay kind of a bloke.
Mhm.
Okay that's fine.
Er 
Am I okay to tell everybody to come in, they're all waiting outside.
Oh aye sure, I mean
I'll just give them a shout.
Okay?
Anything else Bill?
Fine.
Erm  not really, I mean er the salary one we could have got into in greater depth when we were cut
Yes.
that was the  point  
 

No that's true.
That is very true.
Okay?
Thank you very much.
Much appreciated.
Ta.
Grab a chair then, we'll just have a quick debrief and then we'll break for lunch.
 

So you should've all had  where's Matt, do you know where Matt's gone?
No  
 
he's disappeared 
I think it's cos he feels a bit rough actually, he's got a terrible cold.
Yeah.
Right so that was your first attempt at er a role play w what were your thoughts?
Oh 
It was alright.
It was alright, a bit of fun really.
It is, yeah, role play is an effective method of er learning, put into practice, you know  and, if you can hack it here and get passed me, then it's a breeze in the real world.
Supposedly.
Well I hope you enjoyed this morning now what I want to do this afternoon, we're gonna break for lunch now and then can we reconvene at the syndicate rooms at two o'clock
Mhm.
complete the final role play and come back here at five to three and we'll look at then step two.
Cos you've got one more role play to do erm at your syndicate groups so don't come here, go straight to your rooms, but start at two o'clock and then back here at five to three.
Okay?
Yeah fine.
Yeah so I'll see you all after lunch then?
Right.
Thank you.
successful 
 

Oh dear 
It's nice to know you feel like us Martin .
Yeah.
Are you timekeeper?
Yes, thank you very much.
We going straight into it?
Well you've got a five minute preparation first.
Five minutes.
prepare for the er the rigours of working 
And is it 
Sorry?
?
Erm  you are
A pain, I know.
no, no  you're a jurassic.
A jurassic, right.
Yeah, okay?
Okay .
Right.
Got it all under control?
That'll do as your business card.
We're ready when you wanna go 
Okay.
Okay may as well go for it I suppose.
I'll just make sure 
Are we, are we in shot are we?
Yes.
Yes you are.
Okay.
Tell me when you're ready.
Yeah, whenever.
Do you want your count down?
Three two one?
Whatever you like.


You're on.
Good afternoon Mr .
Hi, Rob  from Friends Provident erm very pleased to meet you.
Good, good.
How are you keeping?
Very well thank you.
Oh good.
Erm    erm your directions to your home was very good and er 
Yes.
I, I found it with utmost ease.
Mhm.
Yeah we thought it important to send to you because we are, you know, a bit out of the way that's all and erm  people tend to go zipping past and have to go up to the roundabout and come all the way back down again cos it's quite a busy road this and 
Yeah.
we thought we'd er
What's, what made you actually choose this position?
Erm  primarily I think it's peaceful, it's quiet, you know.
Mm.
Must be beautiful in the summer but then equally as good in er in the autumn.
The kids like it here.
Yeah.
With the old snow and they go up the  the hills up there and er go sledding  and er they find it very enjoyable actually.
Yes.
Right.
I was expecting you a little bit earlier actually, I think perhaps you got the times wrong I was  
Yeah I'm sorry I'm a little bit late but, you know, I just wanted to make sure I'd got the right turnings cos erm 
Yeah.
otherwise, as you say, I could've gone straight past here.
You could've done right, okay, well you're here now anyway.
Right, that's it, and the reason for me er tt coming today, as I explained on the telephone to you
Mhm.
is twofold really, one for me to introduce myself to you and let you know that I am the representative that's with Friends Provident that will 
Right.
now be looking after your er  business
Mhm.
that you've got with Friends Provident.
Right, yeah.
Now  erm  how, how long is it since you've seen anyone from Friends Provident?
Coo!
Oh God, must be  six possibly seven years now when I took the policy out originally I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And s and that's really the main reason why this new sector has been brought up, it's been ca it's called first call
Yeah.
and it's the main reason er that it's been brought about so that we can look after the clients that we have er cos in the past  tt erm  er how did you come to get the business that you have with us?
Was it 
Ooh!
Erm  tt  I think, oh dear, I saw an advert in the paper I think to, to take out a savings plan or something and I just signed up a, a form and back it came.
I see.
An and did, did er was that all conducted through the post?
Er initially yes, yes I think it was.
I got a couple of phone calls from somebody but er
Right.
But you've had no dealings for the past six or seven years?
No not at all and in fact, you know, your call was a, a bolt out the blue as it were.
Very 
Yeah.
surprised to hear, well I'm glad to see you but very surprised to hear from you  
That's right.
Well the, I mean the thing is that erm  over the past erm we've been recommended to people
Mm.
I mean like you, you, you chose the route via the post
Yes.
now there, there must've been one reason why you chose Friends Provident.
Erm there's a couple of reasons really, one  was to get the free gift
Right.
that came with it.
Yeah that's always good.
Well, you know, I think it was a kind of sports bag or something and I thought oh I'll go along with that and the other, I mean I had heard of them before and I made a few enquiries and they said, you know, you  you were quite  quality company so I thought 
That's right.
yeah I'd give them are, I'd put my money with you people as opposed to the  companies.
That's fine.
Well see that's, that's one route that we do business and the other route is through recommendations from, from either other people
Mhm.
or from er brokers for instance 
Right, yeah.
er they recommend that y erm Friends Provident to people 
Mhm.
and er that's the main source of our business.
Mhm.
Now  because we, we've done so much business  we now need to look after it ourselves
Mhm.
and this is why I've been today to see you.
Right.
Okay.
Now erm tt  with er  tt  lost now  erm  no I forget  
So why are you here?
Why have you come to see me anyway?
Erm well it was, it was really to go through erm just to, to give you a face so that you've got someone to contact
Mhm.
Yeah.
tt and also to run through your policy that you've got with us
Mhm.
just to see it's keeping on tract and 
Right.
and erm it's, it's actually performing how you would wish it to.
Mm.
Erm
Well I'm glad you should say that because the bonuses have gone down and that was a
Really?
that was quite a concern really, no it, I think it was nine percent last year and it's down to about four four and a half 
That's right.
or something like that.
Yeah there's been a, a, a big change in the industry itself in 
Yeah.
these past couple of years.
Well why has it gone down?
Erm well it's,i various changes in erm the upset that we had last year with the recession and 
Mm.
changes in the rates and er it caused endless problems with the whole industry and in fact the country 
Oh so it's not just you then?
no not just us
Oh right okay.
it was the whole country, we were all suffering.
Yeah.
But that's really what I want to come and see you about
Right, okay.
and also show you this new erm  tt  this new 
What is it, a planning service or something?
plan er yeah financial planning service that we offer all our clients, people 
Right.
like yourselves and they've found it very beneficial in the past.
Right.
We've found that we've been able to help them er in various aspects of their life.
Mhm.
Er we deal with their immediate erm plans and also their future plans.
Right.
Erm  and I just would like to offer this service to you.
I wonder if you 
Well I mean how long is it gonna take?
Well it should take us roughly erm an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.
Yeah okay.
Now the first thing I'd like to do  is just give you this, this, this explains that I'm er employed by Friends Provident
Mhm.
and erm  it shows you that I will be  erm  only off er offering advice on Friends Provident's products
Mhm.

There's a sports centre not too far from here that er I play badminton.
Mm.
And do, do you normally play with Kay or do you have er 
Yes, yeah we have we, there's a foursome, another couple we play with on a regular basis.
And who, who are the other two?
Are they, are they friends of yours that live locally?
Yes they just live er a couple do er tt  er just down the road from here.
Oh right.
And what, what was the sport centre you belong to?
Well it's just a, I don't know, er the Daventry Sports Centre I think they call it.
Oh yeah.
And your friends down the road there
Mm.
that you normally play with  erm  I wonder if during the course of erm  this discussion today  if you feel erm that it's gone well for you
Mhm.
and you feel that you've found some benefit within this discussion
Mhm.
er I wonder if you, you would mind if I contacted your friends?
Don't know about that.
Don't know.
Have to see what you can do first.
Mm what, what sort of problem do you find with that at this stage?
Well you've not shown me what you can do erm I don't know you that well.
I haven't seen anyone at the company for nearly, what, six seven years and already you say you want to speak to my friends.
That's right.
Yeah I can, I can perfectly understand that.
If you feel that there's some benefit that's come out of this meeting today
Mm.
erm would you have any objection to letting me contact them?
I think I'd talk to them first and if they're agreeable then I'd give you their name and telephone number but I'd have to speak to them first but I wouldn't just give out the name and telephone number on an ad hoc basis.
Right.
Would you mind if I come back on to that later?
Yeah.
Okay just moving ahead now, er with your occupation erm  is it of a hazardous nature?
Erm  not particularly, no.

Does your wife work at all?
No no she's a housewife.
Well she works but 
That's fine.
That's it, okay, well done.
Oh 
Never mind.
disastrously.
I went down the wrong route with the  referrals and 
Never mind we'll just 
 
We'll just see how it comes   
Right.
Right.
Don't rewind it.
Oh right, sorry.
I'll get it back to the place.
Right.
Okay sorry.
Right we'll leave you to it.
Right.
You erm  you're, you're a bit uncertain and a bit nervous all the way  through it  but I think it was, it was basically because you 
Yeah I lost it totally  
er  you, you got unsettled fairly er fairly early on didn't you?
Erm but anyway you s you started off with er with some greeting and er and er appropriate sociability  erm one thing I noticed that Martin seemed to take control of the handshake and that's something that was pointed out this morning and, and looked at and  from where I was it looked as though he was keeping hold of your hand some time, you had your buyer's guide and whatever in your other hand and you couldn't, you know, bring it over and, and put yourself back into control erm  and an interesting one and a, an e an example to all of us I think.
Erm  you  Martin threw one in about being late.
You, you apologized for lateness  the only thing I wonder on there is er you know it's ea it's easy enough to say that  you didn't actually sort of clarify the time that you were gonna be there, you just accepted that you were late  erm but I mean that's a  you know ju just a point I wonder that rather than apologizing straight of all, straight, straight away if you knew you were late then that was one thing that perhaps you could've got that in the initial greeting.
But that's, that's a situation that, you know, you haven't really got control of when it arrive.
Erm you seemed to go straight from sort of the, the sociability side into, into a statement of purpose  erm and then went back to er how did you come to do business with Friends Provident.
Martin mentioned that he, he'd done it by post and you, you ex explored as to why.
He said about a, a free gift  as the first thing and then he said about made enquiries of others  which I thought was almost er er a, a way there of saying well, you know,oth other people more or less recommend  Friends Provident.
Erm where did we go then?
You didn't at that stage I don't think make any sort of link towards referrals and introductions.
Missed out sort of tentative benefits  erm  and went straight into, to talking about the, the C C Q.  Er now wait a minute, where are we?
Erm  one, one of the statements that you did come out with when you, when you were saying about erm why you were there, you said about to make sure that your policy is performing how you wish it to  which is as good a one as I did when I said you're obviously satisfied  with, with your Friends Provident contract cos we're brilliant   erm  Martin asked the question about why has the, why has the bonus gone down and, and you overcame that objection er which was good and he, he was, he was satisfied with that.
Erm when you actually then moved on to start er start completing the, the C C Q you were asking, asking closed questions  er you know you said, said to Martin can you tell me your wife's name and  he said yes and it went on about three or four times   er yeah alright you were getting the names but you were having to ask two questions to actually get them because you weren't er weren't, you know, asking probe questions, you started off could you.
Er with, with, you asked Martin about his dependants and he said he hadn't got any but you didn't question him on the wife's dependants, or his wife's dependants.
Having said that when you were looking at the, at the sporting side you er  you put in  some, some questions about who he was, who he was playing er his sports with, obviously with the idea of, of referrals erm but  because in fact I think because you hadn't done anything to referrals earlier on, when you brought it up there was an obj er there was an objection from Martin to it.
But er having done that erm you, you  apacked his er, his objection very well and in fact you er y you got over that because you, you told him why er and what you could do and, and he, he agreed to er  he was certainly a lot warmer then than he was initially.
Erm  as far as the C C Q itself was concerned you, you gave an awful lot of information about the sort of things you were gonna look for when Martin said about, you know, what's in it and it's, it's pretty big and what have you  you mentioned a lot of subjects or a lot of technical jargon which may or may not have meant anything to the client rather than just say well, you know, some of it won't, may well not apply to you.
Erm  Martin offered you a drink which in fact you quite rightly I think refused at that stage.
I don't know whether, whether it sort of erm rang  any bells with you but normally  if you're in a house people don't offer you dri they usually say would you like a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and I just wondered, perhaps it's my suspicious nature,whether this guy's got a drink problem 


Too deep, too deep.
Erm  the other thing that, that I couldn't quite hear but I thought when you were asking him about where he'd been with the navy, I thought he said to the Far East unfortunately.
Did you say that?
No I hadn't been to the Far East unfortunately.
Oh I see, sorry, I  
I hadn't been to the Far East.
Yeah, right.
Ah that, that's alright, that's okay well that, that is me, I couldn't hear.
Erm but I say there, there were a couple of erm objections that came up during the course of the conversation which really resulted because you, you'd fallen down on the actual structure, but having said that then again there were two or three examples that you  apacked and you got through very well and you, you recovered yourself well on that  and, and I say really I think that's er that's covered most of the bits that, that I felt were, were there.
Okay.
Joan?
Would you like to er
Okay.
have a go?
I'll just erm pick up on maybe some things that you haven't already mentioned.
Erm  I found the, the greeting and the appropriate sociability to start with very hesitant but I think that was most probably just nerves on your part Robert, I don't think it was something that you would usually have a problem with.
Erm and then after the, the greeting you went, the actual erm way that you went was statement of purpose and then you did actually start asking for referrals, you started but then you didn't actually follow anything up, you started the script of referrals but you didn't actually follow it up again with anything.
And then you went on to the stat the statement of purpose again followed by your business and buy business card and buyer's guide so erm  tt that was that.
Erm you closed questioned which I thought Martin made very difficult for you  but er obviously intentionally but  erm  what else is it you mentioned erm  pension or benefits from the navy, you never actually picked up on whether he had any erm pension benefit from, from the forces which is something that, that we would have had to have made a note of.
Erm  the, the other thing I noticed was that there is very little or no eye contact at all with Martin so you, you were never really looking at him when you were asking questions or when he was giving you the answers back, so there was no er visual acknowledgement whenever he was, he was coming back to you.
I'm not quite sure whether you were commending Martin for being able to have two children in the same  year  
 
That was a mistake.
so that I'm not quite sure whether  
speedy gonzales here.


I'm not quite sure whether that was a pat on the back  or what  but anyway  erm and when Martin offered you for a drink I actually took it as a cup of tea actually  so 


I  
I think, yeah.
so I actually took it the other way that, you know, do you just want a cup of tea.
I mean 
Yeah.
it was  it was morning or afternoon or whatever.
Erm  you did try and pick up, I think you realized that er you hadn't done your ref er your referrals properly at the beginning and you actually came back to it erm at the end erm trying to pick up on where you left off and erm  Martin was very non-committal at that point.
Erm and the other thing was that erm when Martin picked you up for being late, you didn't even give a reason for being late.
Erm  I wanted to make sure I'd got the right turning I think was the answer but there was no reason to say I had problems finding you or I was held up I'm sorry for that or, or anything, there was no, there was no actual acknowledgement or reason for being late.
But in saying that I'll go ahead, I'll go ahead with what Robert said although it seems as if erm between us we picked up on a lot of things, there was some objections that Martin threw at you that I thought you handled particularly well.
Mm.
Erm
Bill?
Very near the beginning Maggie gave a wee tip, don't say you're a representative say you're an employee of Friends Provident, it makes life easier.
He actually corrected it later on when he has to go back into it but, you know, just, just a wee point there erm  you did, did it initially but corrected it later on when you, you came back into it.
I actually mar marked twelve closed questions  as it so happened but that's, that's neither here nor there, that's ju that's just a point of reference.
Erm you created er your own problem by saying how long is it since you've seen an F P representative  you're just building a barrier up again.
If he raises it, fine, you deal, deal with it as an objection but if  you know don't, don't invite objections er .
Who did Martin check with before he took out the F P er policy?
And one other thing was er what did you see the doctor about when you were in the navy.
Mm.
Er you saw the er saw him five years ago in the navy, now it could've been just a regular check which every  seaman gets or it could be, it could've been something of a serious nature.
Mm.
One thing I will commend you for, it took a lot of ball to carry on even when you had lost the thread.
Mm.
Bear that in mind.
That's the important thing.
You stuck with it.
Once you get your structure, you'll win.
Erm not much more to add really I think.
Erm  I thought you hung in there for referrals there, that was good, you, you were, you were a terrier there, you're gonna get stuck in for referrals.
The old handshake was just I was gonna see who was gonna let go first, well he wasn't gonna let go so I thought erm you know 
 
there was no sort of, you know, about handshake or anything daft like that he just, he just wouldn't let go of my hand so I had to pull off really.
Erm  the te I liked the tentative benefit, here to look after your clients, put a name to a face erm help keep you on track, yeah I liked that, that was good.
Er handle the objection about the bonuses  cos they have gone down
Mm.
you know so I think be aware of that, that may be a valid erm observation to be thrown back at you.
The permission of procedure, yes I'm offering this service to you, that was good.
Erm  I think, yeah,o over elaborate erm explanation of why the C C Q, that went on a bit long.
I think a structured note  take a few notes, will that'll be okay, done, put to bed.
And I think overall I think until you get really familiar with the structure, keep it with you, you know, and just refer back, that'll keep you on track.
But all in all erm I admire you for actually to hang in there, there was a few pregnant pauses but you kept going.
Well t I mean to be honest erm tt I wanted to try some different things er cos I've seen these guys today
Yeah.
so I wanted to try and go for the C C Q, this is it, this is what we're  gonna ask you and of course it didn't work but I had to try it to see.
Yeah.
And of course I spoke erm er there I spoke a lot slower than I normally do.
Yes I thought, yes it was at a sort of slow pace that was, yeah  
Normally I'm I'm going, I'm racing.
Yeah I'd stick to that.
and I, and I thought well let's try it cos you know I'm going on what we  it was brought up
On Friday.
was it Friday?
Er you know  and keep your, and I just can't do it.
No don't, don't  
I have too much time to think then and that, that's what throws me.
Don't try and be something that you're not
Yeah.
if you talk quickly and you're a er I mean you're very erm elaborate erm
That's right.
gregarious, you know you've always, er your arms are everywhere
Yeah.
if that is you, be you.
You know, stick with it, that's your strength.
That's it, and er so I wanted to try all these things and of course 
Yeah okay there's nothing wrong with that 
it didn't work.
Yeah.
But this is the place to try these things cos the more you try the better you become 
Sure.
but I'd be tempted to stick with what you know you can do when you're actually in front of the customer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos I mean they won't be as, as hyper-critical as we are.
See and, and, and normally, and I, I don't know if, if it's correct with us, but  normally I would, I would speak to the client  talk to him, you know, about different things, whatever, go into his business and all sorts
Yeah.
and then I would say well you know I just need to make a few notes
Yeah.
can we just put that down
Yes.
Yeah.
and then start writing but sort of go over it a bit more, do a lot more talking first before 
Yeah.
I start actually writing anything.
Okay.
Now is that okay to do that?
Yes it is, yeah.
Oh well then that's what I would normally do.
Yeah.
I think so long as you can keep the parts of the structure there 
 
erm  and try not to reinvent the wheel 
Yeah.
I think if you're gonna do something that  er deviate, because the thing is when you do your tandem calls, they're gonna want to see the structure
Sure.
and if you wander off too far from the structure
Yeah.
then they'll mark you down as being non-competent
Yeah.
and you need the  to get on level two.
So I think if you have a plan of attack which you feel works better for you then I think you must run it by your manager first of all to get his agreement before you  
See I would, I would spend much  much more time socializing
Yeah.
and then say well look the reason why I'm here is this
Well the whole point of it is, is  
and then go in to it but 
Yeah.
I wouldn't hit it so early you see, I would 
Yeah.
spend more time talking to him
Good.
Well there's nothing wrong in that but I think be aware of the potential danger that if it is too long
Yeah.
you're only there for an hour or so you may have, I don't know, twenty minutes of appropriate sociability which builds a rapport tremendously well
Sure.
you start to probe and disturb and you've gotta it short.
Yeah.
So I think time management will be key there if that's the way you wanna do it.
Now as I said way back at the very beginning, the greeting and appropriate sociability will set the scene  if it's too short or too long it will doubtlessly alienate the whole process but you can see the domino effect you but you can see the domino effect you
Yeah that's right.
and you miss bits out , you're  all the information and you haven't probed properly, you haven't disturbed  and a weak first  is a weak second etcetera etcetera etcetera.
So it was good, good to see it cos then they now know that it's, that's
Yeah, yeah.
I think, you know, get up there and stick to the structure
Mm.
and if you wanna do something slightly different then do it in a role play scenario with a manager or a senior adviser and er get their feedback accordingly but I'd be te I wouldn't be tempted to do it in the real world.
He's also tried to change himself I think  and that I mean 
And that isn't you.
you're alright  
Yeah.
 
there isn't, there isn't, there is nothing wrong with the way that you are
Yeah.
so you certainly don't try to change it.
I mean look at the difference from that and Friday.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But does that mean that you feel intimidated by me then?
No no no no I just wanted to try a different s 
Right.
different things.
Mm.
I think we said to you on Friday erm both me and Roger actually  said that he  he went into er he went in for the kill and he c he came out with  slaughter   
 
and, and that's not happened and, and he explained that that's what he was us that's what you were used to doing 
That's right.
Mm.
and both of us said he, he was, he was very good at it
Mm.
erm er but it was, it was like the bits in between that he used to slot in, you know the erm  the referrals  
to proceed.
Yeah.
he never does that and that, and that's what we were saying on Friday and it seems like, and I think you've tried to put all those in but change yourself a bit.
Yeah.
And, and it, it will work  now, as simple as that.
And, and like with the objections  I would fire them straight down without  I concede that you've gotta say I can er understand you saying that, you know
Well
this is what happens 
now that that'll become clear but just just 
but I I acknowledge it  as they come they can fire at me every sentence and I 
Yeah.
I will kick them straight down
Yeah.
erm
I don't wanna say that's the right way to be honest 
No.
I can understand but er I'm, I'm used to just going
Yeah.
let's go for it  er but there I was going much slower and there was all this thoughts going on in my head and
Mm.
Yeah.
and, and that's er it's all the slowness which was doing me in.


It was right at the very beginning when you had to ask him about the introduction, I thought you were going straight off from the business card and all the rest of it and what you actually had was your C C Q in front of you  because it took you all that time to get round to it.
Yeah there was lots of bits of paper floating around it was, it was a 
Yeah, that's right.
 
a bit of a distraction really.
Mhm.
I think you just got thrown at the beginning and I think he  you off and  
That's right it was
But then they will do that to you, that's, that's the annoying 
Yeah.
thing.
Mm.
It was 
Thing was in fairness Martin er er it's actually the sociability side er both  both of you talked about the house didn't you and how, how long you came here and of course I changed it to how, the directions er which you gave me now 
Yeah.
you may walk into a house and there's, it's loaded with trophies and you say och whose, ah these are nice trophies, who won these trophies 
Yeah.
That's right.
it's totally  
There's something to focus on.
it's, that's right
Yeah.
there's something that you can just 
Yeah I agree with that.
In saying that though Robert  Martin did make it difficult for you.
No no I didn't mind that and I'm, I, I could, I could sit with that all day long, that wouldn't worry me, he wouldn't, he wouldn't beat me down  just 


erm I would keep going so that, that doesn't worry me but it was all these other things I was trying
It's actually good 
which 
it's actually good practice having somebody like Martin then
Oh sure.
because   because at least he does throw the objections at you and  so at least you're made aware of what you  
That's right.
You learn nothing from a role play that's all easy-peasy 
That's right so that's 
I think 
that's why I really wanted to try all these other avenues cos I'd watched them all and, and each one, no disrespect to any of them, but 
We were predictable.
as, as they went on they got better.
Well they will do, yeah.
You know like Bob, Bob 
You learn from each other.
went up there first and then so it got better and so it got better and, and Will was marvellous
Mm.
there's no question about it and I thought well let's try the other way, let's, let's throw all this C C Q and, and all the rest of it to see how it  falls.
Now you've had the, the benefit of hindsight which would you rather go with, the structured way or the, you know, the way you did it at the 
I th I would go with these


much structured.
Good.
I was er er there was something that I got told many years ago that I  
And also sorry, excuse me  like the other points there  are you a smoker, no my wife does, she smokes twenty  was you a smoker
Mm.
who knows?
Yeah.
And, and about your wife
Yeah.
I mean I went straight in, tell me about your wife, I mean you could've said well she's not my wife
Mm.
Oh yes  
and then we'd've gone down a different avenue 
It's the C C Q driving  isn't it?
That's right.
But that's lack of familiarity with
Yeah.
with 
So 
What I was going to say is I was told erm some time ago that praise doesn't mean anything without criticism and I actually believe that.
Praise doesn't mean anything without criticism.
But it, it just goes to show you that, you know if you, if  if you go down the structured way, it does work.
Alright 
Wouldn't wouldn't you agree with that though?
Praise doesn't mean anything without criticism.
Oh I agree with you.
I've got that video tape.
Excuse me a second I'll just do a quick   
Yeah sure, yes.
