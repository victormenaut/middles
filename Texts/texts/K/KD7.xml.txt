Right
strange woman talking to me or whatever you know

Yeah 
on the tape okay, so if you're still doing that in the next forty five minutes it will be just as above or whatever

ah?
I just didn't know what to do
Er fishcakes 
They're chip

She never said any  oh  and, and also, I know
has got nothing to do with it but she's working an extra two and a half hours a week and getting half an hour off, you know I mean you, in all
the nitty gritty of it, well I could of turned round and said look, well I'm actually entitled to half an hour, I should
just being bloody pathetic and when I went out the back to go home Gaynor said whatever is going on here today?
I said oh don't worry about it, it's just a bit of confusion about
you know, it's just pathetic and she's so rude and nasty  no  mm  that's right  yeah, yeah, yeah  it's the same yesterday when I was writing about that
we'll just send them back the problem and send fully stamped
yeah, I really was quite, quite upset about it, well I don't blame you for it  I wouldn't of minded if she'd said this morning when I'd asked her
Jan
yeah, hang on a minute, yeah that's fine, just take half an hour
or you can't have a lunch break, but she didn't, she just automatically assumes that everybody knows what's going on in her head  be that everybody else should know as well, yeah anyway I've got to go Matt's shouting, he's obviously having problems plumbing the dishwasher, god his little cotton socks, so we'll see you later, alright then, see you later on ta ta.

del , delivering tools 
that 
for the fire station
wait a minute that is for your
could you open that up?

mm, go on
that's, that's no priority for a couple of months is it?
Got the money we might just as well 
wait a minute, we'll leave that in there  we'll let it go out, see how it goes for a couple of months, Glen will know where we can use any money for that anyway for a couple of months
We're not selling that
What, alright, wait a minute, just let me finish, get it sorted out, why was buying a suite when we've got to be stripping down wallpaper and getting dust everywhere and sand and dirt and Christ knows what, just to get it all shitted up 
Well I'm saying
If I got it lying, where, if I've got it in the bank and it's there ready it's, there's nay problem is there?
Ambulance there
Ah?
There's an ambulance there, looks like there's been a crash, a bad one as well 
 

What the hell's happened there?
Two cars by the looks of it
Let the rescue
must of hit some, some ice
see them
but you've got to stick in to your studying Matt
I know I need it
I know you need it, the way you read that letter was atrocious Matt  if the letter, the word just doesn't jump out and tell you what it is, look at the, the words each side of it  Christ 
cos that woman stopped
She's got four red flashers on 
Dad
I'm not heard any word from Commercial Union yet
Dad
what?
 
Well that's a point still haven't got any red letters
Dad
Perhaps stopped and you're insured
I'm insured, it's a cover note cover maybe
Ah
I phoned them up
Dad
want them to send me a cover note
Dad
What?
It isn't
it isn't the case of just being a fireman say get a rescue tender and whirl it up and erm there about, you've got to get, you've got to be a fire, if you be a fireman you've got to get in everything erm
and erm
oh of course you don't, jump in any wagon that's available, but there's certain vehicles for certain jobs, and as Matt said that would just be
Yeah and if you sit there and
then people like to rescue
The control tends to send through a, a fax
They read it on the printer
Yeah
and show you which vehicle to take
and then they take, you take whatever vehicle's
On the
er they say, and if then they've made a mistake you have done what you are told, I mean if you take a big ladder and it's only a wee fire, a small car bump and then there is a big fire later on, somewhere else and they haven't got their, the right appliances because you're at that place with the wrong stuff, then that would cause problems wouldn't it?
Yeah
See you later
It's very rare that happens though
I love you too
Er mum can I have some money?
Sorry
Well done Matt, well done, better doing it now then wait until the last bloody minute when we're outside the school 
Right see you later
Have you got it?
Yeah 
See you when you started crying last night there was no need for that Matt, nobody can  what do you want me to do please you when you kick, that was three things you kicked over in the space of minutes

And then you're knocking the price down by thirty quid!
So?
Then this is where the fun starts!
She'll say  no, oh oh!
Yes.
Then you say no, no and  two fifty .
What?
Shall I bring the phone in and you phone up?
British National

No , you don't got to negotiate, you've got to  be able to speak to people on a  regular basis.
Oh I know that!
But whe say you said three hundred and fifty pound 
Yes.
for that car
You've gotta be able to  not live in fear to say  state your opinion.
And just state what you think is right!
And I think three hundred and fifty pound is a reasonable price for that.
Alright!
Don't you?
Not really, no!
Right, give me a  larger headed   lever.
One with a bigger head than that.
Slightly bigger.
Cor!
I think a reasonable price would be about three hundred and ninety.
