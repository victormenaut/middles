Even though you've got funding for the first time for this  I don't want to spend an awful lot on materials.
Mm.
I want us to use  we ne ee erm  static resources 
So it's more participative.
Well, less participative, more  us teaching, the tu teaching style will be  you know, here's a slide show.
Mm.
 
I think we'll 
Oh I see.
Oh I I meant 
 
are you going out and about looking at, I mean 
Mm.
that's, it's more
Again it's time.
We couldn't do that cos we've got an hour.
It's inviting people in and 
Mm.
I was trying last year to try to see if I could get a  erm  an Indian, you know when we sort of do looking at Asia
Yes.
Mm.
to try and see if we can get some sort of dance group in to get that culture over.
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
 
or get the Gamelan
Yes, yes to come pla 
That orchestra to come and play to them.
oh that was er, was super!
They loved that!
 
In fact, they were on Italy, they were doing a concert in 
Ah.
Italy, was superb!
Mhm.
So there's all sorts of stuff 
Aha.
like that.
Mm.
Ha.
Now then  why I wrote this, it was, what about a year ago  now since 
Mm.
then I've been  of accreditation  
Mhm.
and actually written about it   
Oh have you?
Aha.
Mm hasn't 
Mhm.
been approved yet  cos 
Mhm.
it came through to the school
Mhm.
But I've written it in such an open-ended way
That they can choose.
That they  you know, any of us could use 
Mm mm.
the  the unit 
Mm.
Aha
and tack on our own 
Mhm.
er
Aha.
oh  pattern  round 
Mhm.
it so hopefully 
Mm.
could, you know and the kids that also could.
Mm.
Maybe that's why I haven't had it back yet.
Maybe they find it 
Mm.
too
Open.
open.
Mm, mm.
Cos then Anne comes back to you to ask, yeah.
That's right,
mhm to modify things yeah.
Actually remind me to ask Anne  er 
Mhm.
what's happened to it, that'll be great!
Mm.
Okay, is that fair enough?
Yeah.
So can we go onto page three?
Mhm.
Oh, we're not reading all the notes?
Didn't you read all that?
Oh!
We've 
So 
only begun just turned onto this page!
Well that's what he 
 
said, let's go onto page three.
Page three.
Oh sorry  
I, I'm sorry!
 
I am on page three!
 
I thought we haven't read all the way down!
Mm!
Mm.
So these are, these are summaries of example units that we might do  which either exist already or might be made to exist quite 
Mm.
quickly and easily.
Anne was expressing concern yesterday that  sh you know, she doesn't want to have to   you know, a syllabus.
Mm.
I said well that isn't right  you know, it's up to our individual personal  styles 
Mhm.
and so on.
I happen to like giving slide lectures.
Mhm.
Mm.
I erm  er  I told her
Mhm.
so  erm  you'll find that there's a predominant of suggestions of slide lectures here  if you hate doing them there's no reason on earth why you should!
Mm.
It's just that, you know
These are the ones that are all backed up with notes?
Yes.
Da, mhm.
That's right.
Mm.
But you'd have to do them yourself.
And also, you know, you're not just limited to A one  er, to use  as the resource area
Mm.
erm  I have a slide  projector
Mm.
a big one now, down the library 
Mm.
which I'm trying to encourage that, you know, there's not sort of 
remember how  when I did buy it I  I consulted with you to se , to show that we we were both compatible.
Have compatible ones, so that we can take 
Mhm.
it's 
Mhm.
a carousel isn't it?
Mhm.
So we 
Mhm.
we can take a  carousel 
Mhm.
loaded with slides 
Mhm.
from the art department
Mm.
to the resource centre 
Mhm.
be good!
Mm.
And we've got a video down there as well, working  and tapes.
Yes.
Yes,.
So the 
Yes , I mean, misgivings really is because I'm not within my  area you know.
Oh of course 
Mm.
right,
Yeah, it's new for everyone really.
 
Yes.
Mm.
We're all in the same .
Mm.
Mhm.
Mm.
Erm
Right okay  so anyway, these are the suggestions, and they're not  prescriptive.
Mhm.
Week one  a slide lecture  right?
On a 
Mm.
subject.
Mm.
Week two, an analysis written, hand or drawn or painted  of an example of pre-Raphaelite work.
Now  it should say, at the top there, British painting, the pre-Raphaelites, yeah?
Mm?
Mhm.
So week one is a slide lecture on the pre-Raphaelites
Mm.
Mhm, right.
Okay.
the project will go on for two or three weeks.
Mm.
So, erm  er, the slide lectu , er and it says week two, but it means week two onwards.
Mm.
You know
Mm.
th the 
Mhm.
kid would do work 
Yeah.
based on that
Yeah.
side lecture.
Yeah, yeah.
The slide lecture will be pre-prepared for use by any teacher  and we would have it in a  you know, some slide boxes
Mm, mm.
You know there'll be about fifteen or twenty slides 
Yeah.
some notes, and you'd sim they'd be numbered and you'd lift them out and you put them in the carousel 
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
you know, and we'd have  maybe fifteen
Yes.
standard lectures 
Yes.
available
Yes.
you know?
Yes.
Which between us we could write 
Yes.
over the   
Yes.
as George was saying yesterday, before he'd done  erm  two or three big ones on 
Mm.
and South and Central  American  erm  early, this, you know pre-Columbian
Mm.
er cultures 
Mm.
the Aztecs being .
Also, the Amerindian population of North  America too.
Mm.
That's quite an interesting 
Aha.
one isn't it?
Yeah, north west coast.
North west coast, particularly.
Mm.
Yeah.
Incidentally I made a  personal contact of somebody who  actually knows so ,so some people who  up there, in the north west
Is the no , is that Canada?
you know  
Yeah.
It's North America
Mhm.
erm
and and, and Canada.
Yeah.
Cos I tell you what I have got cos I went to an Indian reservation  and I've got a small carving which an Indian did for 
Oh 
me you see 
right!
so, you know
Anything like that, cos Joyce brought a lot of stuff in didn't she?
Joyce .
In fact, it's actually a little totem pole like you're talking about.
It's still 
Mm.
in the   room we must give it 
 
back to her.
Yeah.
Got a few little er  trinkets that er Joyce back from Canada.
This is only a two dimensional one though.
That's okay, that's great!
In fact 
Anything that's fast made available like this 
Yeah anything you bring in 
and  
it's
You know in the trophy cabinet that  Colin used to be in charge of 
Yeah.
there's a  er a wa erm, a walrus tusk penguin carved 
Oh yeah!
anyway it to so
Yeah.
you know you 
Aha !
it's a .
Oh 
No!
have you not noticed it?
No!
There's 
Oh!
all sorts of things you can  
Yes, I've seen that.
where you're hands are.
I didn't realise it was in the er 
Cos they love to touch these things.
 
Mm.
Yeah, it's incredible!
Yes, I've got one of Peter's
Erm
trophies.
You have also 
 
taped  the wonderful programmes that are B B C two last  er, no is it this year, Spring?
Mhm.
Erm, about the North American .
Mm.
That's right.
I wonder if I've 
Alaska's 
still got all my stuff from the 
I've got those programmes 
from the Victoria Island Museum, because they're amazing
Mhm.
exhibitions in there of Indian  art, and I had loads of stuff!
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mm, so there's quite a lot of supporting material
I, it's I'll I'll 
actually we have got 
see what I can dig out  
See see what you can 
Yeah.
Yeah.
it'll be grand if you could.
Cos even something like a carrier bag that's got the design on the front
Yeah.
Yes, that's right.
Of the Victorian Museum.
Mhm  mm  anything like that.
Mm.
You know, we've  we've got to agree on what we're going to  what terminology we use
Mm.
you just said Indian, and I'm always trying to say  what, what I believe is the  correct thing to say these 
 
days is Amerindian
Mhm.
Amerindian
Ame Amerindian
Amerindian
As in Amer American Indian.
American Indian.
American Indian.
American Indian.
Yeah.
Oh!
I  I I just don't know whether that is right.
They're often they're offended when they Red Indians isn't, aren't they?
That's offensive.
That's offensive.
Mm.
Yes.
A er , whereas we're used to  er
That phrase.
Yeah, a phrase.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah, I suppose it's like saying  black Americans I suppose 
Yeah.
isn't it?
Mm.
Mm.
As opposed to Afro-American or wha 
Mm.
or whatever.
Or Ca or
or Caribbean 
Yeah Caribbean.
American,wha wha happens?
I'm 
Mm.
gonna be 
Afro- Caribbean or whatever.
Yeah, we've 
Mhm.
got to be careful to be right on in that respect, I think 
Yes.
Yes.
now doing this.
Yes.
Yeah, cos of course I mean this is  something that, I suppose  yo you're not  for that  yet some things that you assimilate into your language which simply 
 
becomes a phrase, like I always said nigger brown.
That's right.
Ooh yes, yes
I never
yes!
I never thought of nigger brown as being an offensive remark.
remark, yeah.
It was like saying light blue.
Mhm.
Yes.
And it was only till someone pointed out to me  you shouldn't really say that 
It's an ethnic, yeah.
yeah, cos I didn't, I've never associated it.
Prejudice, yeah.
That's right.
Mhm.
So  we , this is a case of well
Mm.
we've got to
Ha  be careful of terminology.
and not 
Yeah.
use weasel words.
Mm.
Yeah.
So  I dunno if you're  know we whether that is the  the acceptable term at the moment
Mm.
but I think it might be 
Didn't erm 
  
Patrick's friend 
friend, what was he called?
We wa wa was erm David 
He was half, yes 
He was half Cherokee 
he was , yes.
He said Amerindian was okay.
You didn't, he he the often the offensive word was the Red Indian.
That's right  but Amerindian 
that had, yeah.
Amerindian 
Yeah.
was was 
Amerindian 
was 
Aha.
was an acceptable gesture.
So this would be a  Cana-indian would it?
He would do a lot of  Ca , canning if they're in Canada don't they?
Cos though, these are Canadian, these are Canadian Indians.
They do salmon canning don't they, in Canada?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that why it's called Canada?
No 
Yeah.
never mind!
 Cana-Indian 
Very canny man!
He was very canny actually as it happened!
Mm.
It so happened if he got paid anyway!
He got paid.
He got paid did he?
Is he still 
For work.
our friend?
Oh yes, He's still our friend.
Yes, yes, he's still our friend.
Mm.
He got paid for the work that erm
That he made.
he did  er, he sent a bill in a erm
To Bill.
to Bill for that last bit
That's right.
Fifty quid or something.
That's right.
Of course, I'm glad  
Yes.
yes, he wa he was very unhappy.
Yeah, is he coming back or has he gone the other side of the pond?
No, no he he he lives 
No, he li doesn't 
in Britain.
Yeah, he 
Oh.
does a lot of work down in London, he did a lot of work, well they done promotions  er, and he evidently he was in a big job at , what was it in, in it?
It was some sort of stage show wasn't it?
Mm.
Erm  anyway  he he may well come back as a visiting  
Yeah.
erm, artist  erm if we require  er, request it they can afford him.
Mm.
So, ha, back to the pre-Raphealites
Mm.
the pre-Raphaelites, a slide lecture and then analysis written about it  so there's a slide lecture being pre-prepared by the use  for the use by any teacher   hello, there goes  or something!
Three helico , oh, or helicopters went over three times in the night I thought I was gonna raped and pillaged but no luck!
Mm.
The analysis from E G get the  card   attached to your work card  inscribe the basic information, followed up by research  carried out in the resource centre.
Okay?
Oh we haven't done these post cards attached to work cards but we still 
No, we haven't.
they did offer some  postcards yesterday.
Mm , yes, if I can find them Andrew.
If you can find them I've got loads 
Mm.
as well 
Mm.
and perhaps we could have and evening session or two
Mm.
over the next few weeks 
Mm.
Mm.
where I will bring in my vast postcard collection
Mm
which like 
Mm.
that one you've already seen laid out of the colour 
Mm.
section of articles 
Mm.
from the Sunday papers.
It's probably one of those things
Yeah.
because it's covered in blue-tack
Yes.
and stuff they've asked to pick up  and 
Chuck it.
bung it out because 
Right.
I'm talking donkey's years now 
Right , yeah, well anyway
but hopefully it may be er,i in 
i it may be still be there.
in in the midst of the cobwebs and stuff.
So if I bring the, if I bring anyone of mine in which I do know exist 
Yeah.
if we can sit around and actually make some work of cards 
Yeah.
that would be grand!
Yeah.
Too popular arts right, so that was a  an example of the pre-Raphaelites  right?
Number one British painting of pre-Raphaelites that would be a standard 
Right.
you know a  er, a posh culture, if you like.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm  well, you know, because we're dealing with, who are with, and because 
Yes.
Yes.
by culture we mean  all of culture
Mm.
you might deal for instance with the popular arts and to  erm, such as erm, you 
Erm 
know, er  graphic design on, for instance, board games
Mm.
or tattoos, or fairground art, I've got down just as examples
Mm, mm, mm.
so week one might be a slide lecture  on the three themes  plus, erm a show and demonstration of board games, right?
So I happened to have got some  slides of tattoos and  some slides of fairground  er, art and erm  some slides of board games  of through 
Mm.
the ages, and there's some real ones.
Mm.
And they like to be taught a new board game
Mm.
and, they can design  the, the board  themselves 
Mm.
and design a game sort of.
Mm.
So I go on the same as  er, weeks two to four an analysis written, and, or drawn or made  of examples on one of these themes.
Right?
So  they might design their own tattoo or they might design a fairground  erm  frontage, based on what they've seen years ago 
Mm.
the, that kind 
Mm.
of type style and 
Mm , yeah.
primitive imagery
Yeah.
and so on, cos reme , remember they're not specialist artists
Yeah.
so we've got, if we do give them work to do  it's got to be stuff which they don't feel inadequate to do.
Yes, yes , yes.
Erm  yeah, well I suppose I mean, they are quite familiar with the Spanish City a lot of them aren't they?
Oh I should think so.
And actually I don't know  
 
differently very recently but  along the front where these shutters which were the most horrendous graffitied awful places!
They've got a series of  almost like ethnic murals that somebody's done all along.
Have they really?
And 
I want to try and  sort of  clean 
well 
up that area and allow them to sort of do the graffiti.
and it's very nice!
Yeah.
And the they're a cross between  sort of primitives and  and er  I, I don't know whether they are ethnic paintings but, or whether they're  sort of child-like  primitive drawings or what they are, but 
Mm.
and they, they're just done in the shelters
Mm.
and all the graffiti's been masked out
Mm.
but it would be worth the kids on their weekend trips going and having a look in there.
Oh yeah!
I'm sure we can have a photograph 
To, you know and 
of it, show them a slide show and then we can go and have a look.
I could, I could go and I could go and take  if there's, you know, if they haven't,no nothing  awful's to them  I could go and  take some pics of those.
Mhm.
Mhm, be nice!
Because they're rather nice!
Rather nice!
Well I've got film, slide film.
Yeah.
Yeah, just ask me and I'll give it to  
Mhm.
before you go.
Right.
film which I've bought already from the pharmacy.
Yeah.
Will that go in a thirty five mil camera?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, right I can do that.
Well  thank you.
Erm, so a slide lecture pre-prepared for use by the teacher, the analysis carried out by the pupil using the slides and then the visual material and work cards made available to pupils.
I think this is important
Mm.
you know, if you sh given them a slide show  that's all very well  but, they may well want to look at some of the pictures for longer.
Mm.
Don't be precious about it, let them use 
Mm.
the  the carousel  it's very difficult to break!
Mm, mm.
And er  you know, if they wanna stare long and hard at certain images
Mm.
that's, well and good!
Mm.
Mm.
So once you've given the  them the lecture  give 
Mm.
them access to your 
Mm.
notes and your  you know  material you've used for them
Mm.
and er  they like don't they George?
Mhm.
And erm
Yeah.
did that with the African stuff, that happened.
Yes.
A personalised nine man's morris board or an original game might be produced by individuals or groups of peoples  or a description with illustrations of popular tattoo  motifs, like .
Nine man's morris is just  erm  one of the  games that is easy for them to devise  if yo , if you want me to teach you how to play it, if you don't know already I will.
Mm mm.
Don't know, no.
No, I I thought Nine man's morris, I thought it was a ga er, a dance.
It is.
Oh  yeah !
It's a , it's a  an 
Oh!
ancient morris dance that's mentioned in 
Oh.
Shakespeare.
Oh.
But it was one  the er er er er, the village green
Yeah.
right?
Erm, had a nine man's morris  pitch 
Mm.
Mm.
with dancers and wood, sand  one of the, the appointed places
Mm.
and they would be instructed  to move in certain  to 
Mm.
other places
Mm.
when they did certain things, you know  that man was killed and he was off, not really 
Mm.
you know, he was off, out of the game 
Did i , did he have the sticks or
They they, may have done the morris dancing type 
Mm.
of thing as 
Mm.
they passed each other and clashed them  er, nobody knows, so it's lost 
Yeah.
it's  there's a re reference 
Yeah.
to it but he actual dance is lost.
Yeah.
Er, but it was then reduced to game, with pieces and counters
Oh!
which is a lovely game to play, it's 
Yeah.
very elegant, it's a cross between draughts  and chess sort of thing you know 
Yes.
it's it's really rather 
Yeah.
nice!
And kids love to learn it!
Yeah.
And love to play it!
And then 
Yeah.
they can design a board  because the pieces can be  you know, spaceships or
Yes 
Mm.
anything!
anything, you know!
Yes.
Yes.
It doesn't have to be  draughts or anything.
Yes , yes.
The great thing about the game is that you're teaching them a little bit of culture
Mm.
cos it is a, you know  the oldest English board game
Mm.
you're also teaching them to pass their time
Mhm.
Mm.
in you know  in a civilised wa 
A leisurely .
That's right.
way, you see.
Instead of knocking some old 
Because they can 
granny about!
That's right!
They can create nine man's morris board on anything and use 
Mm.
counters for anything!
Mm.
Broken in half match stick  a shell and a stone 
Mm.
Mm.
you know a bro ,yo er, you know a
Mm.
a a ten pence coin and a
Yes.
and a te , two 
Yes.
pence coin.
And of course they can personalise them can't they?
If they, if  you've got 
 
a small group.
That's right.
An and they have enjoyed 
Yeah.
that very much in the 
Mm.
past.
But you can onto more ambitious board games, er, I think George and I both seen  some 
Mm.
very complex board games with er  cards and things devised by people in
technology  by
Oh yes, yes I've 
even se , even seven and eight years!
Yeah.
Aha.
Mm.
And they can produce 
Mm.
Yeah.
you know 
Yes.
really very complex 
Yes.
and er
Yes.
you know very  sophisticated games.
Yes, we do, we do it in English, you se , with the with the text
Mhm.
erm  aro , on the snakes and ladders principle they think of all the, the good things that happen or the bad 
Yes.
things that happen 
Mhm.
and 
Yeah.
this kind of thing and the , they they enjoy going up 
 
and the they pick up the text in that way.
Mhm.
Right.
They pick up, you know, the essence of what's going on.
It's a good that isn't it, for literature, to try and teach literature, yeah?
Well that is the point 
It's very good!
Yeah.
because it's a very friendly, user friendly way 
Mm.
It's like a game, as you say it's, you're just playing.
That's right , make something into 
Yeah.
a game  
Cos I mean, that's how you teach a young child isn't it?
A similar one
Yes
yeah.
Yes, that's it, yes.
Teach young children through games.
Yes  and they go through each 
Yes.
page  with a 
Yeah.
fine tooth comb  actually 
Yes.
looking for strategies to play.
That's right!
Yes, yes, yeah.
Okay 
Mhm.
so we go onto other themes here  which is three  half way down the page.
So, other things  dealt with as above  introduced by slide shows or demonstrations or videos or anything else 
Mhm.
you know,
Mhm.
Mm.
for instance some of the themes could be  canal civil engineering and art
Mm.
you know, including the architecture that went with them.
There's wonderful art work on the canals in !
Mm, mm.
Looks fabulous doesn't it!
Yes.
And especially with  
Mm, the barges 
That'd be lovely  to take er, a holiday  a weekend for the kids, er, you know 
Yeah.
along the barge.
That's right, cos they've never seen 
Mm.
a canal have they?
Nothing!
Oh, you're on your own there now Vi!
And oh oh
Anne!
Where's the adventure spirit !
Even I have taken kids on the canals, it's great!
Mm.
Mm.
Mm, it's lovely!
Falling into the locks and drowning, it's wonderful!
Mm.
 
Make sure they wear their life belts!
I went in the snow once!
Did you really?
It was brilliant!
Oh yeah, I went 
Ah!
in the snow really dramatic.
I've never  never done it in the winter.
Mhm.
Did you go to  that one that says about eleven or twelve 
Yes , yes, Foxton 
Mm.
Locks.!
Is it !
I hate the great outdoors as you know 
and the kids 
but I enjoyed it.
Oh!
Yeah, I mean, the kids how they can be so agile in jumping off the barge
Mhm.
to go and get the lock, to open the lock and to 
It's  
Yeah.
lovely!
Incredible, yeah!
Swi , swinging the key round you know, hitting 
Yeah!
each other over the head!
They love it, I mean it's marvellous!
Incredible, yeah!
Another one here 
It's superb!
illustrated package of the products  for instance the school, there's a comma after sound, there shouldn't be there, sound recording, cosmetics, food and toys  comic illustrations, illuminated manuscripts, eighteen and nineteenth century painting, the whole galo , the whole 
Mm.
cross section.
And there's a lot of erm  new books that I got last years  for the library
Mm.
which shows a lot of this, they're beautiful aren't they, the art 
Yes 
books?
they are 
Mm.
indeed.
Okay  this is, this is the hard work for us now  preparation necessary for year ten, year eleven courses.
Each of three teachers prepares four to five topics per term, starting with a minimum of two  this programme to re be repeated three times per term to A B C groups, carousel .
That way, you know  we after one year we've got enough material to
Yes.
to see us 
Yes.
through forever 
Yes.
if we need to.
Yeah.
That is if   erm  material,material for these topics should be lively  and interesting for the broad range of pupil ability  i.e. differentiation.
They being always of sufficiently high  quality  to be intellectually and culturally developing and stimulating  and justify  potential  of accreditation .
Mm.
Sorry about the printing on these pages, it's very bad isn't it!
Mm.
Can you read it.
Mm.
Mhm.
Mine's  
Mm ,.
probably.
is always just .
Yes.
 
 
That's right!
 
 
Care should be taken  to conform to a  cross-departmentally agreed formula of presentation and content  for instance, work cards should conform in size, style and presentation  and pre-printed questionnaires, planning sheets, and other documentation should use consistent layout, logos, identification, symbols, typefaces et cetera .
And we can agree all of that, so that it makes it easier for storage 
Mm.
and easier for use and easier for 
Mm.
kids to understand it.
Is that all agreeable?
Mhm.
So we need some evening sessions to agree on that, and 
Mm.
find out what's available, yeah?
Mm.
I'll have a good old rummage this weekend cos I got stacks of stuff!
Mhm.
That may or may not be applicable but I'll just bring it in and dump it on you.
Good!
That's alright!
That's fine!
Thank you.
You know because it maybe at sometime in the future
Yes, I'll I'll lo , I love car boot sales like that, great!
Mm.
But these should be designed with a view to be pupil friendly  and easily used by non-specialist teaching, for example, supply teachers.
Pre-prepared units of work should be labelled and stored so as to make them accessible to pupils and teachers alike.
Attendance registers and assessment sheets should be kept rigorously  and easily available .
Erm  I'm getting at Richard  here  erm  instructions of the whereabouts, methods of access  to and operation of hardware, such as tape decks  video and T V sets, video tapes, slides and projectors and other machinery should be kept with work sheets et cetera.
You know, because 
Mm.
if I have to go and do the music I, jolly well wanna do it!
I don't want to sit there 
Mm.
Mm.
feeling like an idiot!
Mm, mm.
You know, without access to the tape decks and without 
Mm.
knowing what's going on.
And I would expect that er, all of us would feel much the same.
Yep.
Mm.
Master copies to be kept centrally and available  for all creative arts staff in A one 
Mm.
in  a filing cabinet 
Mm.
so that we, we all know what's going on and  and where it is and
Mm.
you know?
Mm.
Sure, some of it doesn't exist yet  we've gotta create this stuff, but, you know 
Mm.
once it's created
Yeah.
then it should be available to all, so anybody who goes to stand in when they're off with  er, broken legs!
Mm.
Third process  teaching and learning styles should vary as widely as possible in order to provide maximum stimulation for both teachers and pupils  and care should be taken to plan programmes with a long term rhythm of change or variety  the element of chance and serendipity 
He always chooses posh words doesn't he?
but don't forget, this is all headed
this bit for erm  an ex-position for a creative arts teacher, senior management and governors!
 
You know, I'm trying to get a promotion here!
Show off!
For   !
Where is, where is that?
Alright, I'm showing off!
The very first part.
Right at the beginning.
Oh!
Right!
I'm prowling in other words, by using a lot of words!
 
Don't worry about that pet!
No!
Erm   and though 
You've lost your place now, haven't you?
I have indeed , it's serendipity we've got to haven't we?
 
Er,through for instance, spontaneous people involvement must be catered for .
And I say that because from time to time I've had lessons completely  interrupted by kids  taking the ball and running with it and I've just sat there, it's been brilliant!
Mm.
Mm.
Best bit of teaching 
Mm.
I've ever done just keeping quiet!
 
Yeah, yeah.
And it doesn't matter, you know 
Mm.
cos it's 
Mm.
that's what it's about isn't it, really?
Mm.
That's rigidly adherence to a written formula for programmes is considered counter-productive 
 
to people motivation.
Mm.
Allowance should be made for the fact that these pupils are of an age where they mou , may either streak ahead of expectation to  an enterprise  or remain disinterested and static in their reception programmes.
Both steps are natural  therefore, either, providing too little stimulation  or coercive pushing is inappropriate.
Each pupil should be encouraged to strive beyond a status quo level  but by encouragement to eventually identify personally interesting areas.
Many pupils may object that they find this kind of culture to be alien and puzzling at first since this is a non-exam course there is opportunity for pupils to mark time without any serious results  but to achieve personal development gradually  or late on in the course at an individual pace.
This process needs to be regularly discussed and recorded in consultation with resistant pupils so that they feel encouraged and not threatened  where appropriate professional 
Mm?
and advice should be sought by creative arts teachers when they are preparing programmes  from special needs, special interest  multi-school or multi-ethnic organisations  other departments and from parents with special experience, knowledge and skills .
That's the end of that bit
Mm.
then the next bit is  list of  er, resources that I have at home 
Mm.
mainly 
Mm.
about  erm  everything.
Mm.
And may I suggest that we add to  the list, on the computer  type it into this particular programme be , it's called arts list   
Mm.
a word  anything that we have at home, such as your little carving that you had done.
Mm.
I've got quite a lot of little carvings er, from  I got one from er
if you're prepared 
the Caribbean 
to bring them in and the   and if you could, sort of type them in
Yes.
with your initials  like I've done there.
I see what you done, the A M.
Yes.
Aha.
Aha.
Yes.
Then we know that that person has got that
Yes.
Mhm.
and that if we want to borrow it in a couple weeks time 
Mhm.
Yes.
we can go and say would you mind bringing that in.
Yes I 
Mhm.
yes, aha 
Alright?
cos they, some of them are quite delicate.
Not leave them at school at all 
No I  not.
but just , you know.
Yeah.
You know, they're not goo , I no , I wouldn't just 
Well 
say they  not in their expertise, so I mean, it's just an example of  I mean, the old  see a tourist shop and then I
No, but you just said, that you, you buy every  you know 
every , yeah.
you're a, an airport junkie aren't you?
That's right!
Really?
Yes.
That's it , yes.
But, er it comes in hundreds of stuff like this.
Mm mm.
Shall we have a cup of coffee and then watch a bit of this?
Why not!
Yes.
I've abstained for lo
