Oh no!
till you
No, she wasn't.
Just as well we spoke 
Yeah.
to Roe last night.
Yeah.
Anyway , you alright?
The children are er going not having any money, she said well  Ga , she did say that Gavin was alright but he hadn't met anybody, hadn't made er any friends yet.
And what about Peg?
Has she heard?
No.
No.
She said, oh I expect I shall.
Well I should have thought she would have said, well I'll ring her.
Would you?
Oh well that's the human thing to do!
I know , but it  I wasn't going to say, I was just ha!
She said, ooh she said to me, she said I know Barbara she said it's no good talking about it you wouldn't wanna know, she said, you're alright.
And then someti , I said something, she said oh God!
But I couldn't make out which Richard she was talking whether it was the one up above her or the one above Mrs .
Well she chunters on just for the sake of talking!
Oh dear!
I'd better do that door I think.
I think it's terrible the way these people ignore me she said when I made a complaint!
About the car this was.
Just don't do anything about!
They ignore me completely!
I think it's terrible an old woman like me!
There's more self pity.
But she ha , didn't, is she gonna phone up Frank or
No.
I don't know if she will or not .
Dreadful the way everybody ignores her!
Extraordinary!
If she can find the slightest little thing that sort of effects her in an adverse manner 
Yeah.
you know, the way she doesn't like it then she's up in arms 
She builds it up.
but  everyone else can  whistle Dixie!
And she started to say this morning, oh you're alright!
And then she changed her mind I think.
You're alright, you something and then she stopped.
And I told her once, I said I'm sick to death of hearing you say that every time I come!
But she didn't have a lot to say about Roe's conversation?
Nope.
She'd asked about dad any road, she said, course this is in the afternoon so she didn't then, only this trouble hadn't started then about no money, you see.
They Roe said he was alright  but lonely.
Well, I don't know  but really lonely I wo , I wouldn't read that altogether.
A nineteen year o 
And then as soon as he started his courses and he met somebody.
A nineteen year old doesn't get lonely.
No.
You're sure to meet er, get in touch somebody who's doing 
But he's , he's in this  what?
Yes

No.
hundred pounds  advance to  so he's 
pen 
still in the
penchant or something whatever it is.
That's right.
Penchant.
I don't think we should worry too much about  his affair, but, at least er, you must be prepared with, with the  to live.
That's first..
Anyway I think, still think it would be better to  
Well it would have er  split the the copper stuff and it's not very good.
No.
And that would have sa , split it altogether.
Oh well!
Anyway, I think that's far enough, I hope so.

They're not brilliant quality but they're alright.

Oh they're good, they're  they, they feel good.
And they've got pockets in the back and
They feel good.
Well I mean to say as long as they last him.

Yeah erm but she doesn't put much on though.
I don't think.
Your deal.
It's just a little shop, she's been there years, she must have been there thirty years at least.
I would have thought she'd probably made a mistake somewhere along the line.
Cos I say she's been there thirty years so she must do alright, everybody knows 
 
her and everybody goes in.
What about putting er something in the middle then?
Are you dealing?
No it's you!

glad when it's done.
Yeah.
You've got a pair of aces.
Oh  just missed them.
