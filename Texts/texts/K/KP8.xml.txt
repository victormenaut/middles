No watch.
Choo!
Cos you don't play.
What did yo 
Hello!
It's Wendy.
Oh hello!
Hello.
Hello Wendy!
How you doing?
Oh I'm just sitting here having had a long, well erm  I I've just had a, a chat with Gillian who erm  rang me up and we were on the phone for about half an hour I suppose, she's some lucky girl!
She's just been er, come  for erm, Stobo Castle for two or three days.
Oh!
Erm, it's an arm and a leg but I think she feels that she ritually deserves it  er you know.
Aha.
I mean it costs about a hundred and twenty three pounds a day
basic without the extras!
Good grief!
And she went on a party of three, no, no, she went with a party of four friends I think, there were five of them altogether  and er  she stayed for  well er, three nights, four days, or four days, three nights I can't remember  no, it must have been  four days, four nights, three days.
Anyway, and it was all such a, a resounding success so I, I was regaled with all the details of what she, and in what she had indulged and er, she said she went in more for the pi er she didn't go in for erm  aromatherapy and the  reflexology and the facials and the manicures and things, she went in for loads of bicycling and exercising and er  and  steam baths and things .
Ah.
Sounds wonderful!
It sounded more like, she says to me I think you should save up Norma and 
Mm!
you know, really go and do th have a pamper to the, and I said, oh yes Gillian I will, but the  she said and go with Marion because you get a twenty five percent reduction if you share a room.
I thought, well Mari would be the very last place that Marion and I would want to go to!
And, and in fact, the very thought of spending nigh on five hundred pounds for erm  er for 
Phworgh!
you know, for a few days like that, I mean th it, it,I al almost shudder at the thought because there's so much else I would, you know, prefer to do with five hundred pounds.
Mm.
I know.
Anyway, er  so I thought for a , I've had a large of the press today which is, it's a very tense case indeed.
Mm.
Yes.
Erm
Mm.
he arrived and  had a spot of haggis, bought one left over.
And, and, and   
You mean he, mean he scrounged  lunch out of you too did he?
Well I, we'd finished lunch and erm  he, he, er I just said to him, what would you like?
Would you like a pie or there's some haggis, neeps and potato left?
And he said, ah!
That sounds good.
And erm  course
and he was , you know, even in the micro it went and 
Mm.
there was really quite a lot left over.
He, he said oh, you know, you, he really enjoyed it.
Er, and I was glad he did
You'd think I 
because 
you'd think I'd never fed him!
Well, you wo certainly would have thought so today I must admit but erm  he er, no he, he in fact did a couple of good works when he was here.
Oh did he?
Just, yeah well he, he put two springs into the top oven of my cooker  and which erm, he, even he admits really hasn't made one
Mhm.
much difference to the door, but at least it doesn't flop down now and I don't have to stick a bit of cardboard in.
But, you know, at least 
Mhm.
it stays up, erm, but it's a bit dodgy.
And the other thing is that it's erm  er, er Jeremy had er  er, inadvertently really, er I, I know that I could have crowned him when he did it, but  he was getting er, taking the lamp from the bookcase erm, which is at the end of the bookcase through to his own room to use temporarily because in trying to get the shade off his, the old one there, he, he snapped the fitting, and why, when he did that, erm, he er, disconnected the phone and of course, wiped out all the memory  you know, the numbers that that you put in!
Ah no!
Ya!
Ya.
And of course, er Chris was astonished when I told him, and he said but why, you know, mum it shouldn't do that, it should re be retained, you know 
Mhm.
the entries  so he said.
That's right, it should.
So anyway, I said, well it hasn't happened Chris because I, I tried to ring you, you know
Mhm.
er by pressing enter and one cos you're number one on the, on the, on the list.
So 
Ooh!
We're honoured !
Yes.
Top of the list.
And er 
Mhm.
I said, I'm afraid erm, you know, that  so he, he had to take some time, er, we ha we took some time to find the book of the words which
Mhm.
the erm  eventually found the bookcase.
I thought I'd put it there, looked through and couldn't find it, we were in every drawer in the blooming house!
Anyway, I went back to the bookcase and Chris, in fact, also came and we looked for them, he said, here it is!
Anyway, you know, I'd been er, it has been staring me in the face for so often.
Er, so often 
That's always the case.
Mm.
Did you erm, get the phone  fixed by the erm, G P O?
Ma erm Chris said you were having problems.
Yes.
Yes.
And did they have to come in  and 
Erm 
sort the line?
Was it the line?
But that was erm, over a fortnight ago and they came and they er, rewired  er, rewired the house, in fact Doctor  
Really?
was here, right 
Mm.
through the blooming utility room!
And do you know when they came?
No.
They came a fortnight past Saturday afternoon when the match was on!
Oh no!
Ya.
Ya.
Well you could have left them to it.
I know.
But that was service, of course, you know.
Mm mm.
But I was showing Chris my erm, you know, telephone bill which I was so horrified to discover was something like a hundred and nine pounds!
Wow!
And, he said I don't how you do this, you know,yo I really don't know how you manage to run up a bill like that.
And I said, well I don't know either, I think I ought to get some, er my, my bill, you know, detailed
Mhm.
er because I said I, I only phone Marion once a month and phone mum probably about once a fortnight, I don't like to leave it any longer and erm  and I said I know I made a few extra calls over Christmas, but I said I really don't know.
And I never phone unless I can  erm, well you know if I can possibly avoid it I never phone at the most expensive time of day, I avoid mornings like the plague if I can  possibly manage
Mhm.
so  and erm, and still my  total number of calls come to seventy odd pounds  but then, over above that is rental and then VAT
Mhm.
and it comes to a hundred and nine pounds.
Did you, with the new phone did you get rid of the, the other?
I did, and they, oh Chris erm happened to notice  that they have charged for a new phone that I haven't got.
Ah!
Ya.
So it's just as well I let Chris have a look at that bill.
Aha.
Yeah.
But it's 
Well it's 
only, I mean, it's, er they've 
What a cheek!
said, they've said, removed one Statesman of a telephone and then provided one Statesman telephone which of course they 
Ha!
haven't done.
So, I'm going to phone up erm  the billing place, as they call it, it's an O  eight
hundred number to
Mhm.
it's a free number, I shall phone them tomorrow and erm  or Monday,th I mean, it's only a rental is,th th the rental itself is three eighty a quarter, it's not as if it's
Mhm.
an exorbitant or extortionate amount, but erm
But,th 
anyway 
they'll probably charge you for putting it in as well.
Erm, well I don't know Wendy, I'll have to go into that when I, I don't think they have, I don't know that they have charged me for, well they've certainly charged me for the new wiring.
Well I think, I think you do have to pay for that, I know
Really?
mum, mum wanted one of these new, new sockets  to put th erm  th one that you can sort of clip out clip in
Yes.
and they sa said that they were  they would charge for putting all the new wiring in, although you're still paying for th you know the
Yes.
That's right.
having the, the blooming thing in the house and 
Yes.
for the rental
Yes.
they st they'll, they charge you for that.
Ya.
I know.
They're 
Mm.
going charge eighty pound something a quarter, but that, that's the line which Chris said I 
Mhm.
I didn't order, they always say 
Yeah.
oh we'll charge you for that.
Mm.
Anyway I hear that you had little Jonathan  John said.
Yes, erm
And he's going to be started now  .
Yes, they're just putting, well th th most erm    useful erm  conversation we had was with the, the ophthalmologist, she was, she was superb  erm  and advised us to get it done as soon as possible.
I think so.
Mm.
I, I, I share that feeling
Mhm.
because I think that the  the  normally he, he has it done are greater.
Of course, if they are usually, er, er you know, when I say they are usually they  th the success rate is absolutely phenomenal!
Mhm.
It, it really is absolutely phenomenal!
I was speaking 
There was a young girl had this done to greater success.
Mhm.
That's what he said, he's, had to be done before twelve, before the age of twelve.
Yes.
And I was speaking to Elaine today  erm, over at  Queensway, who, who I used to work with  and erm, her  erm  nephew,ne niece
Mm.
she had the same thing  done erm  last year
Mm.
with a great success ra erm  very successful.
And I was tel telling, I didn't realize that erm  not getting  a fa erm a squint patched was erm  as dangerous as it is, as, I was told by the  ophthalamagist that she could, he could lose his eyesight if he hadn't erm  didn't get his eye patched because they will stop using the eye, and the eyesight would go.
And she said that erm  Gordon, her husband  erm  he has no sight in one eye due to due to exactly the same thing  not patching erm, an eye  at the, the right age.
Oh!
Well.
Erm, leaving it too long, and now he's  as I say, last couple of years he's been to se to see why it is he's getting headaches and they say there's no sight in that eye at all.
Aha.
And, purely due to a slight squint
Oh!
as a, as a boy  erm  una un erm  treated
.
and, causing problems now.
Well you know, well you know the, the  when I was a little girl, of course, I was totally prepared 
Yes.
for this and  I certainly
You had the patch, you had the, glasses didn't you, with the, the patch over it?
not that I perceived any longer if the  hadn't gone.
Mhm.
Well that did the trick.
That was all it needed.
Erm, they do keep an eye
Yes.
just to make sure it doesn't go 
That's right.
back.
You see, I have very poor vision in my left eye, I mean, absolutely appalling 
Mm.
vision so 
Well maybe that's been the cause.
Yes.
Exactly.
And I mean really, really dreadful vision, and erm, er er of course, erm  er er er, I just have compensated, you know, I really ought to wear specs all the time, and just, and just know that I just take specs off and on, off my nose as, as I, you know, need to er, as I require them.
But erm, er, did yo did you, did you ever know that Alan  also had an operation for a little 
No.
squint there?
No, so it must  must run, er run in 
I would 
the family then.
I di I did remind Chris and he just said, oh yes!
I do remember now in the distant past.
Mhm.
I says, well your cousin Alistaire when he was a little boy before , he went back
Mhm.
Holland
That doesn't surp 
but he 
surprise me  but he's got erm, he ha he wears glasses doesn't he?
And said 
And he, he doesn't at all now.
No?
No.
He wore glasses until he was into his teens and then er, he took them off and he's  er, he doesn't wear them at all, and his sight is absolutely perfect.
Oh, well there you are.
He has no problems at all now
Mhm.
Wendy, and, but he's certainly had an operation for the correction of a squint when he was about six.
Mm.

That's right.
with milk, but

So 
arrangement.
Erm, Wendy, erm 
Mhm.

We're  haven't decided where, but erm  Chris wants to go to  the cinema.
Yes, and he did say when he phoned me a night or two ago that you might 
Mhm.
thought you might go to the 
He was hoping Star Trek erm  Six would be on, but erm  so far i we've  it hasn't been advertised erm, and er, it's been on and premiered in  erm  in London, and he hoped it would come out here  erm  this week, but erm 
Well what about J F K, I mean, that looks
Well we wanted to see that but erm, it's three and half hours, three plus hours  which erm  we wanted to 
 
we wanted to go for a wee  meal  erm  afterwards and it meant  er made an awfully late night with the, having the baby-sitter, got Christine next door coming in to baby-sit.
Oh yes.
Erm, and it's quite an early start so  it's, it just makes it such a late night to  for eating  by the time you've come out the cinema it's erm 
Well, yes it 
so late.
does dear.
Yes it does, it certainly does.
By the time you get out and 
Mhm.
I mean, even if you go for a, a Chinky or an Indian it's 
Yeah.
still very late.
I think we've decided we, we will, we will go to the cinema and probably see J F  K, er and  just have a snack in er, and go  save the meal up and have er, that later in the month.
Yes.
And enjoy 
Yes.
it.
Chris is desperate to go back to the Hargate, but erm
Is he?
Yes.
His passion for the Hargate.
He's,yo I was saying you went there and you weren't impressed last time.
No I wasn't.
It's changed hands.
No I wasn't, no I wasn't in the least bit impressed with it.
I wouldn't, I wouldn't go back.
Erm 
Really?
As bad as that?
No.
And erm, they were all complaining.
Mm.
Erm, I er  no I, I was  desperately disappointed when I 
Oh.
was last there which was erm  with 
What?
Dorothy.
Haven't been  er, well it's over a year ago now when we  were there.
Mm.
I'd, remember you saying that and
Yeah.
it could have been just because it's, just had just newly changed hands and it might have 
Well obviously it might have been 
improved.
but I mean   er ghastly.
I mean, really, really ghastly!
It's erm 
Mm.
the worst meal I think, er, I went with Dorothy , it was the worst meal out, we both said that, that either of us had ever had ever had anywhere
Really?
Oh!
it was such a terrible
Is it, it's the same style, it's still open sandwiches 
Yes.
Yes.
and er
And erm  you know the erm  er, I, I don't know whether it had any adjustment changes or what, but 
Mhm.
but everything about it was  just shocking!
Mm.
That would be  awful to go cos he's, he's so  passionate about it.
Ha the Hargate 
Yes.
to, to go in and be erm
Well that's it.
Well he, he'd 
Yes.
you know.
Yes.
Alistaire, Alistaire's favourite place
Mm.
and I don't think well
It's a shame to spoil it and go and have a rotten meal there.
Yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
Especially you
That's what made 
pay for it.
me feel so bad about it Wendy, because I thought, everything that ever meant anything to me
Mhm.
seems to be disintegrated round about me, even to the blooming Hargate!
You know, that I 
Mm.
thought I could always depend on.
But er, and also, you know the association with Alistaire's, the things that Alistaire liked, that was
Mhm.
I think the thing that erm  that er, made me feel so, so utterly  and profoundly miserable about that evening.
Ah!
However, erm  there it is.
And I wouldn't say, I thought your phone might have been  Graham because er 
I was just going to ask
Not a wo 
any word?
Not a word
No?
Wendy!
Not a word.
Not a cheep.
And I, it's now ten days, they're onto some scam, and erm, I've, I had a letter from Marion erm, course, well to say they were no wiser and er  she sent me some of the 
Mhm.
photographs, she sent me three lovely photographs  taken  in erm  i in St Helens Road the day of her party  on the Sunday before Christmas  and they were so good I've ha I've, I've got, rushed out and got little frames for them.
Oh good.
Yes.
Oh, the th the three, there's my three brothers and their spouses and erm  one of erm  of the nephew and nieces, erm, Robert  and Rachel at the end, and Carolyn and Andy
Aha.
in another one.
So 
Good.
there we are.
Erm,wha are you erm  erm  er  any further news from Australia?
Erm  no, none
Yes.
none erm, recently, just saying tha exact same that erm  George is s s still very  very weak.
Yes.
Erm    not up to visitors,ma erm,sh she has limited the times she's visited because she's got the children, and he's just really not  able to stand the children 
No.
around him.
Oh yes.
His tolerances level is  is erm  non existent.
Oh!
You know the erm 
Just a matter of time.
I know.
This is it 
Mm.
you can't stand any noise
Noise and the
at all.
or the,th especially when the they're children.
So erm  mum and dad has been writing and erm  I think they phoned
Yes.
erm but ea she wouldn't bring him over to the phone, she said oh he's too weak to come to the phone.
Erm  which I think was, disappointed dad because erm  I think he would like to have had a word with him.
Yes.
I'm sure.
But erm
Yes, I'm sure.
but they've, they've written anyway and  so it's very difficult to, to think of things to say and  erm
You don't know what to say 
No.
when do you when they are .
You're at a loss totally.
One is at a total loss  for words to express adequately how one really feels inside, you know.
It is erm,
Well 
so awful!
Anyway, won't  get morbid about it, there's erm 
No.
How did you get on at erm  at Cramond?
You were going down to  Jean and Ronald's?
Erm  oh no I didn't go to Cramond darling!
Erm
O 
I went with Jean to the theatre.
Oh!
That's right.
I di and then of course, the previous erm, er Monday I erm, I was at  oh, the seventieth birthday  party, but I think I told you about that  didn't I?
Erm  yes.
Over at Gillian's.
That's right.
Yes.
Well it was Gillian and, and erm  and Ronald's sister.
Erm  and 
Oh.
then er  a week ago last night erm  Jean and I went to the Lyceum together to see Arsenic and Old Lace.
How did that go?
It was lovely!
I enjoyed it enormously!
Jean did.
And I love, I love that film and they, they show it  quite regularly on the T V.
Yes.
It's a 
Yes but Alistaire saw the 
super film.
film, it was great.
Mm.
Yes, it was a  it was a fun evening, it 
Di 
really was.
I  
Did it compare to the, the film?
Yes.
Oh yes.
It was a ve the  the Lyceum Theatre Company and it was splendidly cast!
It was, it was really refreshing and su I love live theatre, of course, I really ought to go more often.
Mm.
You should.
So erm, in fact, I would have loved to have taken Jonathan to the pantomime  erm, it's on until er
Is it still on?
the 
Is it still on?
Yes.
Mm!
Good grief.
It's on till the end of the month.
Erm  the 
What, what's on this year?
I'd  heard nothing 
Aladdin.
about it at all.
Er, it's Aladdin.
Aladdin.
Yes.
And who's in that?
Oh!
Erm, erm  er, what do you call  erm, Jack  and erm  and er, what do you call, erm  er who's the woman?
And erm, Russell  's new wife.
Anyway, it's a superb cast!
Apparently 
Mhm.
it's really brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!
And, but  i i he, next year when they're both a year older, you know 
Mm.
I think they may appreciate it more  erm
I think it would erm  I don't think their concentration span
No.
would, would last out
Yes, well 
for 
apparently 
especially not Michael's.
I think they would 
Mm.
er, but  little erm, I think by next year, you see, Jonathan er will be six, and, and, and Michael will be 
Mhm.
coming up 
I think 
to five so
I think definitely next year.
Yes.
Definitely.
We should 
But I 
all, all go.
but I did feel, certainly 
Mm.
yes, we'll all go.
Make his a make it an outing.
That's right.
Oh yes.
And it's,i it doesn't erm  seems strange going a sa so wa far away from Christmas, and er  think of panto as, seems 
Yes.
weird.
Well it finishes at the end of this month.
Gosh!
I didn't realize it went into February.
Yes.
Oh yes, it does.
It goes, they, they, er it has 
Mhm.
I think it has about another fortnight to run Wendy.
Gosh!
Ya.
I think so.
Erm  so, there we are.
Erm, you're, so you're not working this weekend, it's the next weekend you're working?
No, I swapped erm, I should be working this weekend  but 
Yes.
erm, I swapped with erm  Bernie.
Ah!
Erm  and it's worked out marvellously.
Aha.
Er,unin unintentionally er, because  I have  my days off  Thursday, Friday next week
Yes.
which are the sa same days as the school's off for their 
Oh!
erm, half term.
Oh good!
And I've got this weekend off, not having to work when erm  it's Chris's birthday so 
Yes.
it's 
Yes.
it's worked ou out  well for both of us.
She took  erm   stupidly  erm, she says herself  she booked erm  the Friday  and erm, the Monday off
Aha.
to make it a long weeke because of the schools being off
Yes.
erm   to make the most of the holiday , and then found she was working in the sh in the middle.
Ah!
So erm  it doesn't bother wi the weekend's better for me cos Chris is here to cover and then I'll have 
Yes.
That's right.
er, the boys off.
So, er so you work tomorrow day, so you worked Wednesday and Thursday when you didn't expect to be, but you're off now?
Yes.
I see.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
It's funny how your system, I, I was  it got to Thursday, I thought    and my system  sort of er  was telling me, oh I shouldn't be here, I'm getting fed 
Yes.
up wi fed up with this!
Yes.
Erm 
Yes.
That's right.
So, so used to your sort of  third week  having a day off in the week.
Yes.
But when it got to lunchtime today  it's been quite  .
Yes.
It's been very busy, got a lot of people off sick with erm, flu.
Lot of flu going around  erm  it's quite short- staffed  so  busy, busy!
And are, you're all very much better now aren't you?
Touch wood
Yes.
we are on the mend.
It's er  well it's a relief to feel well  just erm 
.
They've both got runny, runny noses but 
Yes.
erm  that's the time of the year, yeah.
I don't think they'll be free of that until  until the summer.
How about your tooth, did you get erm
Oh that's a lot er better 
sorted out?
thank you.
Yes, that's much better.
I have to go back to the dentist next week but er  erm  er, in fact, it's not this coming it's the week after, it's a week on Monday I have to go, that's right.
Erm, so erm  erm  and that is the day that erm  er  both mum and Marion are due to fly off to Oz.
Mhm.
I take it she won't be a she won't get anything done before she goes now?
Well she couldn't could she?
No, there's no time.
I er, I know, I, well I wrote to Marion and said er, I really think that erm  if they do find something slightly amiss now erm  the  a  is out of the question.
I said 
Mhm.
he's got to take consi into consideration the amount of  recovery time that is required, and especially when they're  you know, interfering with the waterworks of somebody 
Mhm.
that age!
That's right.
And embarking on such a long trip.
So, I think they'll probably say, oh just go and enjoy your holiday
See you when you come back.
and we'll deal with you 
Mm.
when er  when we come back.
Because she, you know hi she took that intensive course antibiotics i which was obviously contributing er  to her being so unwell 
 
and, and had discomfort too, she's been a lot better.
Well maybe it's just been a deep, a deep-rooted infection.
Yes, and she's, she's definitely had 
Chronic infection.
she's definitely had a chronic urinary infection.
There's no doubt whatsoever about that.
But I don't think it's the whole story Wendy.
I, I, think that there is  you know, something er ba er  mechanically amiss as well, but er you see, you know, she, she says that she's, she's certainly been able to visit, which is mum's favourite expression, a lot better
Mhm.
and also, erm, she says I've, I haven't got this awful sort of very sore, blown-out feeling, you know, and, and, and that has left her, so  you see, it,i I mean God knows how long she's had this chronic infection!
.
Well I'm gla glad she's getting something done about it now cos you  and she'd just been left,sh er, hadn't been persuaded she'd have just let it go on and on and on wouldn't 
If the 
she?
if arrangements hadn't been made for her to go to Australia  might be, she hasn't been  may have  you know, she still hadn't been to the doctors
Mhm.
and because, it's only this, it's only me, it's only me that, me that tricked her.
Was it?
.
Oh yes.
I thought you'd managed to talk her into it.
Oh no, no, no.
She's already 
Mhm.
you're coming along to the doctors.
I doubt if she'd been, er would be have been there yet.
Anyway
Oh well
erm
and she's getting something done now.
I won't keep you, I
Mhm.
er, I, er I thought you might be watching Love Hurts, you're not following it?
Erm, I
Do you?
I, I have actually, erm  no I'd forgotten it was on.
Yes, it's very good isn't 
I 
it?
well I, I'm not watching it but Gillian said, well I must go now
Mhm.
because I'm going to watch Love Hurts.
But it was also  about erm  er  trying to get some .
Mhm.
So we've arranged to meet, we're going to meet in 
Oh!
in , in February.
She wanted me to come er, to meet her next week but really, what with my Chris has come and then, and then 
Mhm.
Anne is probably coming to us still on  
Is she?
day, erm, you 
Great.
know
and er
Wonderful!
we a we are going, we are going out for a meal on Saturday night i er, in, with or without, we're going out, I've er  we want to go to the   when we went with .
Oh!
Erm, er the trouble is
Mhm.
at the expense of the company they said  you know, he, he says that er he says Martin had said to him, you know, you should take your sister out from time to time, there's no reason why, you know, we we couldn't 
Mhm.
put it down to expenses and we'll cover it.
Quite right too!
And so er 
This, and you put him up every time he comes up.
That's right.
And they're not 
Oh yes.
forking out for any
That's right.
expenditure.
This is it.
So er, so er  Alan is 
Good I'm glad.
hi er he's got to go, he's got his annual medical, it's a very high-powered  erm thing  in Dundee on Tuesday, so  Anne said that she would like to come up with him, potter about Dundee while he's having his medical  then they will come here on Tuesday evening, or late Tuesday afternoon, and we go out for a meal, and then of course, she'll be with me all day on Thursday because he goes back up to Dundee to his managers' meeting, you see.
Aha.
That's the way it's worked out.
Oh well, you go  down town or something with her?
So er
 
Well, I probably, I probably will.
But it just means that he comes up with my car.
Oh!
Just ge go anywhere sh I'm sure she'd entertain herself at the shops, she'd be quite happy to
Oh yes, but 
wander round the shops and
if, now he's gone 
potter.
I have to  you know, and, and besides, when I come out of there I look like as if I've been .
 
So, anyway
So what!
So what!
I think I'll just, no, no, no, no, no, I have to concentrate on her, it's not that I see all that much of her.
Er if she comes, that's right 
Mhm.
I mean she might suddenly find that she can't get the time off the hotel, or she changes her mind, I don't know.
Mhm.
Erm  so, so, there it is.
And erm  then a I, Gillian couldn't see me on Thursday, and then Friday William is coming up for half term, so  er 
Actually, he must be getting on ja William, he must, how old is he now?
William  he was born in seventy ee ee ee ee ee  six  yes.

Erm, he was having wasn't he?
Well I don't, oh yeah, I didn't ask  you know.

Amazing isn't it?
Yes.
It certainly, it's certainly  do you know that erm, er  Rachel is thirty two  on er

What's Gillian doing now then?
Oh she's erm, she's not doing anything at the moment because erm
Is the tourist, the business erm 
Er 
totally  out the window?
Yeah, but she's not working at the moment.
Er, she says that she's er, there's absolutely nothing doing just at the moment, erm, but she says that she never knows the time when she will be called upon to  you know, be asked to do a trip, but
Mhm.
really right in the middle of winter and there's really nothing much doing.
So, she is resting, albeit 
Resting.
unwillingly at the moment.
Mm.
Has she still got that  boyfriend.
Yo oh yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Chub chubby.
Yes, that's right.
Yes, that's right.
And, have you heard from the erm cousins  and er
Erm, they're going off  they're, it's, probably away this, this weekend, erm  Sheila's  but they're all going  erm 
Right.
oh was it this  when is it they're going?
It's the Eas erm    the half term break
Aha.
I think.
Erm, they're going down to Bicknoller  erm, to stay with  her mum.
Where?
They're staying 
Erm 
where?
They're going down to Somerset
Yes.
to stay with erm  Sheila's mum.
Yes.
And, to let, basically, to let nanny see erm  
Alex.
Alex  because she hasn't wa ma although mother's been up  erm, nanny always gets  shot off to the erm  the home  and she hasn't actually seen her.
Well now I can tell you, erm, I actually wanted to erm  and, and, and, and really as, as, as erm  perhaps a bit of an old softy but
Mhm.
I really thought that I would have asked Chris if he is  pay for his  erm   Society here in .
Mm mm.
And er  for his birthday.
That would be lovely!
So I had no idea how much it was  but I thought 
Mhm.
well I'm not gonna ask Chris cos I'll just write a cheque to   Society.
Aha.
So I thought well there's only,th th the, the easiest way of finding out is to ring Keith.
Mhm.
They're away.
No.
No answer.
No, no.
So I rang, I rang him last night  and, they're not away  and they've erm  he was able to tell me that it was exactly a hundred pounds.
Gosh!
That's gone up then.
It's gone up, yeah.
So,th the poor, poor Keith has been terribly, terribly poorly all week!
He's been 
Has he?
off work.
Yeah.
Oh!
And, he said 
That's sudden.
erm, I think really that he's finding erm, er the, the pressure of, of erm, of, of the , I mean, bloody kids are almost unendurable!
And, you know, he's been very wheezy and pro and, and, and er, and  has a, er,ha has been suffering some sort fluey cold.
And Karen last weekend, after you  were sitting for them  suddenly took ill on the Saturday I think, and Sheila wasn't in any great shape, so he went back home er, from the office  an over his lunch hour to see if he could just go and lend a hand,ge generally help out over his lunch hour.
Mhm.
And he said he was alright over  you know, that period and he said he got back to office, then two hours later he said he was in, in such great pain!
Oh!
And he said, I  suddenly felt  so ill, you know, and I was shaking, and, and, and, and, and obviously started running a temperature and, and my, my, er  and, and shivering and whatever.
Mhm.
And he said, it's most unlike me, as you probably know, but he said I couldn't tell you the last time I had time off work, but he said, I haven't been into the office since th cos I've been feeling really bad!
Yeah.
That's jus that's the classic one that's going around 
Aha.
sort of fluey, fluey-like symptoms
That's right.
And guess, and guess  who erm  has been helping out?
Oh.
Evelyn of course.
Yes!
And guess, who 
Mhm.
in actual fact, because they thought she'd be better out of the way, had the baby last night?
That doesn't surprise me in the slightest.
But when he said, we thought it would be a good idea, we took a Ali erm, erm  mum took Alex over to Craigmiller Park, and we thought it would be a good idea if she just stayed there overnight because if she wa if she's escaped it by, you know, tomorrow then she should really  you know, be safe  and, and 
Mhm.
a voice came er, from the, the back of beyond and Keith said, oh he said  Sheila has just reminded me to tell you that it was my idea.
In other words, in other words, she wasn't going to do th have Norma think that er
Aha.
that she had th but erm, they, I don't know wha I really, honestly don't know er what they would do about, she would do about Evelyn.
Ah,oh .
I don't know either.
Se they fall back on her so, so often 
Yes.
She caved in, in, she caved in  she can't face up to er, to anything very much really.
No.
She's always been like that though.
Ya.
Yeah.
And, gonna, she's gonna carry on being like that while, while Evelyn's there to
Yeah.
pick up
That's right.
as she drops 
That's right.
everything her, coming 
That's right.
behind and pick it all up
That's right.
and cope.
That's right.
So, I thought I would let you know, I didn't tell Chris this 
Mm mm.
because obviously  and this time, because Chris turned up unexpectedly  and, I had his card, and everything 
Oh!
all ready, and stamped
Oh!
and when I heard er th from him that he's going to  er  pick up somebody somewhere, and pick up somebody somewhere else and go to the  to a 
Mhm.
football match tomorrow  I thought, well I'm not posting his blooming cards, I'm, I'll just hand them to him  and if at sometime you're stuck for a 
I'll ste steam them off !
Yes.
Too right to.
I'll make use of them.
Yes !
So I just kept them, but I thought
Good for you.
imagine!
And I'd only done them ten minutes before 
Oh!
he appeared.
Oh!
So you could steam them off and slap them out again.
No, no, no.
I'm not really good at that.
Leave that to me.
I er, I, you can do that, I, I, I'm, I, I thought, I thought of that, well really, you know, erm  well isn't it, isn't it just me?
So erm
It is.

So yeah.
quite quick then just, towards the end?
Well I think for him  he was very, very .
Mm.
Er, you know  but I, she, when I was last week at Sheila's  she said he  he  her, you know, sign of
Mum!
taking it much further you 
Mum!
see because of the  
 
there, I suppose the food  with the, some of it you know  the tumour was stopping the food getting down, so I suppose  you just live on what you've got in your body and
Mhm.
which is only about a fortnight isn't it?
Yeah, food, food-wise.
As long as the fluids are going in  but erm 
Well that's right, yeah.
And once the, once the 
Yeah.
cancer takes over it's  it's  you know, it's  it's usually quite quick.
Yeah.
So anyway, it's gonna be 
Ah!
a relief for him.
Mm.
And for Gillian 
It's 
too.
Yeah, I know, she's had a hell of a  well for the last  two or three years.
Mm.
But er  we said, oh you've done very well Gillian and she said to, to your father, she said oh it's been a pleasure to do it.
Aha.
Well  !
Shame.
So, anyway  erm  I phoned 
What 
Sheila up
Mhm.
and then, and got the  baby-sitter !
Ah no!
And so erm  I mean, she knows but, I was just wanting to, to start flowers but
Yeah.
Gillian said she didn't want flowers, she didn't want to, to, they thought they were a waste of money and er  she said, needed, she'd wanted to send any, if you wanted to send any just to send it to, to nursing.
Aha.
Donation to the  nursing 
something like that, but  she's  you know, dead against  she didn't like funerals anyway.
He only wants the family there.
Aha.
He doesn't want  the fuss  the golf club and everybody there sort of thing, very, very, quiet.
She hadn't de decided yet to  what day, because it's a weekend.
Oh!
But er, I think , Gillian's brother knows a  a friend who's, works in the  crematorium , down at er Mornington, so I suppose they'll be 
Mm mm.
getting in touch with him, but  nothing mu much they can do, you know  at a weekend.
Mhm.
So, anyway  that's  a happy relief, but sad but 
Wait till, wait till Monday.
there we are, at least we can see him when he sort of reads his will.
That's right.
That's the same 
I mean 
sort of 
Just as, er just as well you didn't go out because erm  you could have been  half way out there in the plane or whate when erm 
Yes.
Yes.
when he'd, he'd popped  popped 
Yeah.
away.
But, anyway
And be better remember him the way he was, I think.
Yes.
Er, I suppose 
Anyway, are you all fixed up 
is dad, dad upset?
for tonight?
Erm  sort of!
Sort of.
I've got the baby-sitter coming in  erm  coming in quite early  erm  quarter to seven  and then

She got her  waterworks done?
Yo you mean granny or the, or the gas  ?
We well how's granny?
Erm
She must be getting ready to go.
She's heard nothing from the, the hospital they  after the tests.
She's had 
Done?
she's had nothing so she hasn't had anything done.
Good God!
So she's gonna be going off to, to Australia  erm, as before with no
Yeah.

So  it's  not long now as you say.
It's next week 
No.
isn't it?
Sixteenth isn't it?
Aha.
That's right.
So she  I think she's erm, she wouldn't want it done  just a few days before anyway she'd have to 
Oh yes.
she'd have to recover 
I thought at the time sh er she was leaving it pretty late.
Mhm.
Very late.
Well I did, I did wonder, especially with erm  you know, waiting lists and  they don't get in that quickly.
And Norma, of all people, should know that.
That erm 
Well, well, it's, erm 
Even i even if your priority was erm, you know, when you've  like dad with his prostate that erm
Well he was a   
blocked off, he had to 
he was, couldn't pass anything and then, I mean, he was just mo more or less slipped in, but I think
Mhm.
you know, if  if he'd been left to  to probably some other doctor he probably would have  said, oh you know, you can just have a catheter or something.
Cos I mean, I remember  saying that, they, he knew somebody that had a catheter for two years!
That's right.
That's right.
It's just luck if you can get, get erm
Yeah.
a, a gap on the 
Louis has had just had his call for his hernia, but he's gotta ring up on Tuesday to see if there's a bed available.
So, he's having the hernia.
Who's that, Louis?
Yeah.
Oh!
So
No
you see, he, he  he can he cancelled cos his name came up and then he cancelled and he never heard anything and went a bit er  we told him about Doreen, he said, oh I better go down and see what's happened er  he went down  and then about  three minutes later he got this  erm card yes er, this week to say that  come in, but, before you come in  ring to see if there's a bed.
Mhm.
So  he's erm
Especially of the winter they wha they have what they have erm, they call  yellow alert
Yes.
and red alert  where there's, if there's lots of people with erm  pneumonia, and
Yeah.
bronchitis and    medical problems 
Yeah I know.
Ya.
they, they block off the surgical beds, they get erm  priority
I, I know 
and they 
they've had  when I went in 
take them into the surgical wards, the medical patients
if you remember when I went in 
and they start cancelling.
like all kind of  
That's right.
You got cancelled.
They said  they said oh there's    no beds left at all, there's probably about ten and the  there was a bed, then I had to wait till about half past three in the afternoon to get into it.
And that was  er  nineteen eighty five.
That's right.
So  anyway  won't bother you.
How's Norma?
Mm mm.
She got a   
Hmm.
or  whatever it was?
Ah ha?
Yes.
Erm
What was it a fuse?
No, no, it was the radiators, er problem with the radiators.
Radiators.
And, they had to pull everything up and she wasn't very pleased about it.
They're pulling, then she had the, the erm  you know she got a phone for Christmas, we gave, we gave her a 
Yes.
phone for Christmas so Chris plugged it in and then
Yes.
and then she had a complica problem with her line  and she was blaming the, blaming the phone.
Erm, and Chris had a look at it and said it's not the phone it's your line, so she had to have the, the G P  O people in.
Erm  and then of course they had to  haul up the floorboards and  re re-lay a line  for the phone
Aha.
for the phone she's got.
They've got a blooming cheek!
The, the Post Office, the erm    erm  telephone people  have charged her for the erm  a new phone  when it's, and it's her o her own phone!
Ha!
What a cheek!
But she's not paying it is she?
No, no, she'll  she'll erm  she'll query it, but  just as well she noticed otherwise she'd have been merrily paying it and Norm Norma doesn't 
I know.
It's very naughty of them.
no Norma doesn't look into these things she just pays them.
It was erm 
Well that's 
la i she'd given it to 
 
to check 
Well that's a 
and he spotted it.
Yeah.
Well that's the thing with our, I mean we can't have one of these  erm
No.
actually plugs in because we  we got the old fashioned sort of wiring.
Well yo you could, but you'd have to have erm
Pay about thirty  
the wiring replaced and a new socket put in.
Yes.
Which would cost you but then th you see a if you just get a plain ordinary phone they're not erm  they're not that expensive, I mean  you can get them for ten pound!
Yes I know, it's, yeah it's just having it all up, it's all round the doors and  you know and they  suppose they 
Mhm.
pull it up, well they might leave it and just co disconnect it but  they they'd have to bring it in, I don't  it'd be better I think if we had ours in the back because the, the telephone  thing comes in from the back  be better than having it in the, in the passage really.
Well 
You, you'd be handy for one upstairs.
Yeah, but it's, yeah 
I'd, I'd like you to have one upstairs.
Yeah.
So erm  save you running down the sta stairs if there's  a phone 
Yeah.
call in the, in the night.
If anybody breaks 
Plus 
in.
Well er, exactly.
It's, plus it's gonna save, plus 
And for safety,
plus for safety.
at night.
Well er  mm  I was gonna say it wouldn't, maybe that wouldn't happen if you had a  hand one, you know one of these hand ones, but er  it's an expensive  but erm  it's for safety even if you, there was a  you, you thought you heard intruders or
That's right.
you, you were, became unwell in the night.
Yeah.
You know
Yes.
it's, it's, it's much safer to have one upsa mind you, we don't have one but,
 
upstairs .
You'll have to get into bed.
Yes.
How are the boys?
Yeah.
Oh!
Erm, fine, fine, they're boisterous as ever.
I can hear them screeching around in the background.
Oh they're, believe it or not they're outside, you can hear them from outside!
Oh!
They were here initially, but they've gone outside, they're out the front.
So there's
How's your tooth?
Erm  oh, touch wood, fine.
Aha.
I can't believe it dear!
If I'm, did aunty tell you I'd, I'd changed my dentist?
Yeah, you can't just go?
Going, I'm cha erm, cancelled yesterday cos I wasn't off anyway  erm  but I've managed, I've used that as a  opportunity to go onto  the other doctor  the other dentist.
Which one's that?
Miss .
Oh yes.
Changed to her.
I think you can have anybody anyway.
You can, yes.
It's just, er the only problem is I'm half way through treatment and I don't think 
Oh I know.
I don't think they like you changing half way through treatment.
Yeah.
But erm  there's only one day  that erm, he does that I can go anyway.
Yeah.
And there's, er, two days I can go when, when she's on.
Yeah I know, you've got an 
So 
appointment the same day as me, but  cos the thing is she said  well I, I still want the tooth out but then, I'm supposed to have a  a, a, an appointment for the, the , I thought God that's, I might have a, she might extract the tooth and then I won't  wouldn't wanna go with a bloody mouth to the hygienist.
Mhm.
But I don't suppose they would
Oh well.
give me another for that.
She'd,sh she'd cancel and give you another appointment.
Mm mm.
Er, she said, you know, make it one to  sort of so you don't have to come back.
Mind you  it wasn't all that long ago I was, went 
Mhm.
to the hygienist anyway.
No, you've  I haven't, it's me that hasn't been, I'm terrible for  ah ha 
Anyway, better go.
not going to her.
Better go.
Right.
Erm  so er, he hasn't opened his cards, he's  he's not back so he, he's
Oh he's away is he?
He stayed at Norma's last night.
Oh did he?
Well erm  Fiona  his boss  erm    she's leaving, so it was her leaving do last night
Oh!
and  then it went on to his birthday so they made the excuse that they'd have a  a double celebration.
Oh!
Erm, and they went out last night.
He'll have a sore head then?
Yeah.
He'll be hung over.
Erm, so he sta 
Ha!
stayed at  Norma's, and, he's coming back  briefly, because he's got the football, this afternoon's a  big match on.
Has, er who's taking over from him then?
Er, no 
Nob 
the woman?
Oh!
I, I thought you meant from the football.
Erm  but it's go it's gonna be open to erm, applicants but  he's already made enquiries as to his erm chances of getting it,th and there's, there's so many people  wi already being given promotion but haven't got a  erm a post
No.
who are sitting waiting for posts, erm, it's most likely be one of those that will get it.
But erm  he's certainly, he's made enquiries.
There's a  lot of changes in  afoot, we're erm  I shall  discuss it  let you know all about it one, one day if anything comes of it.
But erm,a unless you do something yourself there's no promotion i in 
No.
in the civil service at the moment at all.
That's him been in this post for  twelve years?
Yeah.
Erm  which is unheard of!
Yes.
Unheard of in the civil service.
Usually, couple of years and you get, you get erm a promotion, but there's nothing, and the, the jobs that  are coming up they're erm  they're already sort of la allocated to people been given promotion.
Mm.
And pass boards and erm  you know, are just sitting waiting.
Some people waited three years to get a post  for a promotion they had  you know, three beers, years back.
So it  erm  he's  thinking, I don't know, ah he wo probably won't like it but erm  it won't affect me, it'll affect Chris  erm  he might be going down to  down to Leeds.
Why?
He maybe,th there's lots and lots of posts down in Leeds  coming back e every weekend.
Mhm.
Just erm, having digs down there.
Erm, taking promotion that way.
It's, what they've done is they've closed er er, erm  branch, an office  massive office in London  and they've moved them all over to Leeds because they can't get the people to  take jobs in London  so they've transferred it all to Leeds, and erm    there's  a chance of erm  getting promotion, well, a very good chance of getting promotion down there.
But if, if I stay here  it means that we've, we've a, a ho a home in the, the base, and he'll get a transfer back  guaranteed transfer back within two or three years, so it means just travelling for  for erm  you know, that length of time.
Puts it all onto you though doesn't it?
To get the children to school and all the rest of it.
Well  erm  just have to get on with it and  and  and cope, there's  plenty of single parents who have to do it themselves all the time.
And  got lots of  good friends and  Le Lesley's always super  erm  to fall back on.
But
Alright.
There's no 
no other solution for it.
It's o onl only a thought anyway, we just, as I say we're just erm  we're mulling it over and it hasn't  the jobs haven't even come up yet, but erm  it's, it's  it's a means to a
Where's Fiona 
an end.
that's gone, the ga the woman ?
She's going to Leeds too?
Oh!
She's going to 
Mm.
Leeds.
She's erm  but she's from down that way
Mhm.
not from Leeds, but she's not far away from Le from Leeds  so erm  it's    it won't be so strange to her.
But  he seems quite keen, Chris.
Erm  it would be beneficial  so
Aha.
I've given you  a  I've given you a warning if I   and it won't be such a shock to your  sa system if it erm  if we come out with a  the news.
Right you are dear.
Take care dear.

Don't bother 
Yeah.
heating it.
I, I had, I had to finish, no   curry  I had finished my, my veal with my jacket on.
Oh!
And that's unlike you too, you don't usually feel the cold.
I mean,, but I'd really, seriously wished I had said to the waiter, but obviously we're having a good time  .
Er  I seriously wish I'd said to them  you know, I'm, I'm phoning it a fortnight in advance because I want to stick to the arrangements.
Cos they can easily seat sixteen up there.
