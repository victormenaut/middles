It just looks expensive though that's all.
Very expensive.
Ah 
How's, how much do you think?
Oh erm, I would, I would think about three hundred pounds summat like that  am, am I right at three hundred or?
Erm, there's that to do, a new wing and that door to straighten out, a new front, all front balance
Oh well done
and the side light 
It might be seven hundred then
Yeah, well, I went down and I said to after the eng the engineer had seen it, he said like
order the parts and everything, so I went down a couple of days later I said just for curiosity what's, what's it gonna cost us this bloody lot?
You know
Yeah 
he said well we haven't got the price for spare parts yet he said, but I don't think we'll get much change out of a thousand pound
Good heavens, how, what happens then, do you have it to pay or do the insurance pay?
Oh the insurance pay for that 
Oh do they?
Oh aye
I just have to pay the first fifty pound
Oh yeah
of any claim whether it's my fault or not 
It makes fifty pound though cheap doesn't it you know 
Oh I'm not 
I mean you think, when you sign y with your insurers thing say well I'll have this and I'll pay the first fifty 
Yeah 
really it's nothing is it?
Oh no 
these days no 
no, no, well when I, when I get it, the thing that gets me going is this, that complete car cost me er six thousand, eight hundred
Yeah 
and then it's gonna cost a thousand pound to repair it so 
Yeah 
I mean bloody hell if I er 
But how d'ya feel about it once it's repaired?
Well it's alright, I mean if it was the chassis that had gone
Er
er if it was the chassis had gone, I don't feel very happy at all 
No
but er, well I mean it's a bolt-on wing 
yeah
I mean sometimes used to get hammer and chisel to 'em
That's right and chisel them off
and chip the wing off, now they don't, it's bolted on, so I thought well bolted on 
It's like a spare it's like a spare part really, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
yeah, yeah
well I had a Triumph Herald once upon a time, everything with that was bolted on
Mm
it was smashing you can, you could take anything off, the only thing you had to cut was, was a little thin fanlight at the back here  and one at the front, inch and a half wide
Yeah
it was welded on, that, well that held the roof on, everything else was bolted on
Yeah
and there was a little Triumph Herald sign on that, bolted through, that was to cover the weld look, and that was smashing and then they went through all this welding job  and I, when he lifted the bonnet up the engineer had a look at it, I said, oh I said is this bolted on?
He said yeah, I said oh thank Christ for that  so he said oh, he said nearly all the cars are bolted now, the only thing, the ones that aren't bolted on now are Fords they still weld all 
Yeah 
theirs on, but er
Of course that's just making it easier for manufacturers isn't it really the car 
Oh this is it I mean they 
I mean they're not interested in ordinary motorists are they?
Oh no I mean we've been down there  when you put dash like, when you have to wire, er a bolt goes on the dashboard and everything, well Christ I've been round, we went round er  Sunderland works, Nissan, at Sunderland, and we've been round Rover works
and we've been round Ford at Halewood
Eh
I mean when you get there they just get the, the dashboard out and the bloke on the bench he puts everything on the bench
Yeah
and they just drop it in with a clamp and it gets sh shoved in and then another bloke just connects all the wires up
Yeah
and so they say well to take it, to take the board back you do this, you've got to remove that bloody dash
 
Yeah, no 
they do, we watched them shove an engine in, you know, it comes along the belt and and stick it in 
You did want to be able to go around all them works, what, what was it with the
I C I
I C I
well
cos our, our 
Yeah 
our sec our like chairman of the group is er, used to be a, a district convener for the union
Ah
and he's still got something to do with the union, so what he did, when he goes to these meetings he said to the, ah you bloke at Nissan how about getting us round
Yeah  
and ac according to according to Nissan we're all retired er  
 
and then er Vauxhall we got invited round fifty of us went round Vauxhall 
Oh that's good that's good, er
and I say round Vauxhalls the only thing we didn't see  at Vauxhalls was the er paint shop
Oh yeah
he says because the smell there is so great
Yeah
it'll be on your clothes for a long enough so 
Yeah 
but we, we set off  in a big building, well a building about four times the size of this  these houses  and it was all sheet steel wrapped in polythene packages
That's marvellous that, yeah 
and that's where the steel came in
Oh
all treated
and then a, a stacker truck came in with a pile er, a four foot square foot doors and he 
Yeah 
went through and he put a two pile that down, another on er bonnet and it was all planned out and it was all, these stacker trucks went in
Mm
and we watched them and we watched er see, that's the only thing we didn't see
Mind this manufacturing line is a great time saver and a money saver int it?
Right
Yeah, you haven't mentioned going round the brewery there then?
Oh not while we've been round er
we've been round Sainsbury, the back of plant of Sainsbury, we've been round Lime brewery at Blackford, we've been round Tetleys brewery three times
What Leeds?
no four times 
Leeds?
No Warrington
Warrington
Then we've been round the Carlsberg brewery at Northampton
Have ya?
Yeah 
twice 
that, now that'd be interesting 
we've been round yeah
yeah
Scottish Newcastle Royal brewery twice 
cos there's always a free t 
twice 
free drinking in, in
Carlsberg's the best
Is it?
Yeah, yeah
Er
you know you can have all the fish courses, you can eat as much as that as you like, then they have all the, the meat courses
Yeah
and you eat all that, then they have the sweet courses to go from and all the time you're drinking Carlsberg before you go in, then er, like er, a Danish snack like  aquavit 
Oh
you're drinking that during the meal like you know and 
that's amazing isn't it?
Er amazing what they can do
and when you're with the
come down with ya, where's the, they'll only take twenty
Ah
so when we went down there to the brewery there were forty eight cans of Carlsberg on the coach ready for us and coming back there were another forty eight cans so  it's er 
At Leeds, they er, I haven't been and er I were in the Conservative club at Queensbury and they had a club, they had er, er a trip that went through to the erm, to the brewery and Leeds tt and they have a fi er a sociable room you know 
Yeah 
a sociality room whatever, whatever they call it and er, and they gave them a good do really 
Aye 
er, but they didn't go in for food like er you're talking about 
Oh, oh no 
the, the treat was at the end they gave them a very er, an opportunity of having a very strong drink
Oh well 
but er 
this, when we were round Tetleys at Toddington, er, you have a few drinks at the bar
Mm
and then they say there's a trip going round at the brewery, er you can either have the er  twenty five minute trip or the, the forty minute trip, whichever you want, well of course everybody says the twenty five and then the rep always, it says oh well these fellas have been four times before so we stop in the bar and you can have what you want, spirits whatever you like and then the bucket comes out and it's, it's smashing 
Oh well it's, they're very good aren't they?
Yeah
I've never ev er the only one I've ever been on, I went round Dorman Longs once
Yeah, right
but I only went round Dor Dorman Longs because the man who's in charge of the labourers who moved all the machinery about er I sort of went with him see I didn't 
Yeah, yeah

Yeah
but erm
Er, I'm going round Rovers in April 
half are going to Rovers and half are going round Cadburys place
Ah very good, yeah

I don't 
been a lot, on cars there's been a lot of
 
yeah 
and, and on, and on beer there's a lot of
 
Oh aye, yeah 
yeah
I couldn't work in a car factory
No 
doing one thing for a fortnight
That's all it is it's repetition go over and over or around whatever it is

I've asked him to do a bloody couple of jobs and he hasn't done 'em yet
No
simple little things
Yeah

But then it's left altogether int it?
and that 
Yeah 
silly pillock is a bloke who wants, who's got a little office on the promenade at the 
Yeah 
station
Yeah
and he's planning all this damn, it's costing millions of pounds and it's costing thousands of pounds while he's sat in that dammed office having it all drawn up and 
Yeah 
that, er  digging up the centre of Morecambe, done away with this bridge and that
Yeah
he's a bloody
for a bus driver and never made a bloody penny 
It makes you wond it makes you wonder really, really where they get the background for planning doesn't it?
I mean they get into these jobs and really they've no background of understanding of the exact 
Yet it's the bloody simplest 
No
thing
I'm, I'm, I'm a bit against er traders like, like builders and all like that and trade people being on the Council, I'm a bit against that, er but after saying that, those kind of people do have some understanding on what's to be done 
Understanding, yes 
but, but these fellas they come along and they have, they get in because of a policy 
but what a per 
rather than the person
My policy regarding Morecambe is this, people come into Morecambe as a private individual like yourself, like me, like my family and we come in here to accept Morecambe as it is
Yeah, yeah
not as bloody what the committee wanted
No  
bloody towering bloody flats of 
ruddy peo aye, aye  and they've raised the rent of every damn thing up, ours isn't r combination houses rent 
Yes 
my rent gone up on allotment
Yeah, yeah
now what's it you know five hundred percent 
Yeah that that, that go, that's not right is it?

she says we'll, we, we had a later
so she were just having a few crumpets 
And er is she gonna come you say?
Well  I told you what she said about her and Sandra you know and I wrote and said when they you know if they felt like coming for a day that'll be alright I said but don't be having anything to eat I'll bring in sandwiches, I mean I, I know I've said it's very kind of Sandra to say, but you can't, they, way your relatives are coming and bringing sandwiches can ya?
Ooh definitely not
It's ridiculous 
Can't have that 
but,then again with Eileen  you never know with Eileen she says well it's, it depends on our Sandra she said I'm not building up on it cos you know what she is, but she says if  you know she might want Alan to come and then she goes on and, and then, then she says I don't know what we shall do really if we do come, she says cos if Eileen won't, she's work, really can't come if Alan comes
Oh of course they can can't they?
They haven't mentioned it to Ida, of course they can
Yeah
so, if, if, if they're all four of them coming er and she says about going in for a meal I shall say oh well if you feel like it go and do that then and come for your tea  I mean it's just putting them round table isn't it?
Yeah, what, how many's that?
Er six 
Well we can manage it can't we?
Well we have, when we have James and Robert it's a bit of crush isn't it?
But er  I haven't, oh with four it's just nice, five enough
Oh what I'm really saying is that you can't er
Oh I wouldn't dream of I mean 
 
Oh I know, no I wouldn't dream, I mean
think that good enough to come and see you then having and bringing,br having their dinner and then bring your sandwiches for all lot
That's right
Our Lisa well she said I'll stand at
we'll take sandwiches and ferry you and John an'all, I said well
very good I says but you tell her just to forget that will ya?
Otherwise she'll get her hands and face slapped 
Mind you see they're, they're very willing aren't they to er
Well she says if you'd of come to Sandra's she'd make you something, I says I know Eileen and so would I as well, I says I wouldn't have anybody coming in and bringing them sandwiches, I mean if somebody knocked on the, on our door one day from Queensbury and we didn't know they were coming and they'd brought sandwiches with them
Yeah
well you can't do nowt about it then can ya?
No that's true
You know or, but I mean I could make, you could make anybody sandwiches can't ya?
It's not a, it's not a long journey either from Queensbury to Morecambe is it?
No 
When they erm
oh no it isn't
and the lies she's 
She says as I say I'll have to wait and see what she says, because she said, you know when weather gets better, oh I says you're better off waiting while it gets better weather
Yeah
I says and you've more daylight then
But the daylight is improving now isn't it?
Very, very nice 
I'll say it is I'll say it is  but she says she has a trapped nerve in the top of her leg, she says sometimes it's not so bad but she said it's not bad, you know when I get up she says I'm in a lot of pain and it, you have to take painkillers for it
How old is Eileen now, she's seventy, seventy?
Well she was seventy since we came here, on our second year, so she'll be about seventy three I think, her birthday I think's in er November or something, she'll be about seventy three will Eileen, let's see, Uncle Jim was seven when I was born, so he, I'm sixty six next so he will be seventy three, I'm sure, oh no  well that's right int it?
That's seven
Well if you knew, if you knew the difference between her age and yours you see 
She's about, only about twelve month younger than him
Aye 
well he was fifty seven when he died 
Mind she seems very a she seems very active Joan though don't she?
She's very active minded is Eileen yeah very active 
Well  physiclar particular
Well as I say she's, she said she's had sitting and er ache you know and she has these things just to keep going, she has taken up inside her, just to keep going, that's why she goes and has that like I had  to examine inside that no more has grown and all the things inside her
Aye, yeah
She has to go every so many months to check that they're not reoccurring, but apart from that she is, she's quite er, she's quite good, quite active minded cos playing go bowls and 
Playing bowls and
and the West End Chapel keeps her going er and she said many a time that helped her to get 
er bowls at Chapel have been  
over un losing Uncle Jim did the Chapel 
Oh it's
mind it'll be very nice to see 'em come won't it?
Oh I'd like, yes I'd like someone to come here, oh I'd like 'em all here for the day 
Yeah well that's right, cos you see they're off by, half past six 
You know 
aren't they, six o'clock?
Yeah, I mean Eileen if Eil Eileen ever can manage to get her friends to bring her and at weekend, Eileen's no bother
Er 
she's easy to get on with is Eileen, probably be shattered with talking after she'd gone, but she's easy I mean I, there's lots I wouldn't want coming to stay, but Eileen is one I don't, I wouldn't mind because, well oh I know Eileen's ways and er, er, her, my interests are very much like hers we've similar interest with family and everything, er it's just if you've nothing in common with them 
No 
that's, that's gonna be a bit awkward 
It's a pity it's a pity there isn't a regular certain bus service int there?
Yeah 
If we had a regular bus service  rather than a regular train service 
Yeah.
You see really, I mean it's no bother if you're going, if you're coming from Queensbury to here
With what?
The train
No I mean 
If you get if you get
it's not cheap those not, not at all 
Oh no, oh no I'm talking about, oh aye, yes I understand that, it's not cheap
and you've got to get to the station
but if er, yes if you have somebody to take you to station and then we pick 'em up 
and if you're coming for a few days you've, you've bag carrying and all this in the business 
Ah aye yes yes  yeah 
anyway that's the way it goes innit?
I mean I know you stay well you know you have, you have relatives with cars and that, but you can't do with putting on other people can ya?
Never, never
You can't do with asking, if they offer, it's a different story, so 
Mind you does Alan work away?
And Sandra's at home int she now?
No she's not no she's er, she's teaching so many
What
half term 
what she's not aye, she's not full time though is she?
I don't think she's full time work, no 
No, mind you it might be so, so long each day
Oh, aye, yes 
Yeah but if, if you know what I mean I, I thought she was er, I thought she was 
That Alan isn't working away, I mean he comes home every 
Yeah 
night, yes, for his meals 
What have you had tonight then Joan special?
Mine needs putting in there 
Oh that's me jumper 
I've all them tapes to play you know with interviews
Oh my goodness John I don't know who you're gonna interview  the national treasury
 
well I'm thinking of er er 
Recording their own conversa the trouble is though, if you're recording your own conversations you're a bit stilted
Oh you are definitely
you're not, not, not natural are ya?
That's right 
The tapes and conversation details will all become completely anonymous  no one will know who's used the words or whose voice are on the tapes  together they will provide a permanent record of how the English language is spoken in the nineteen nineties  we'll go down in posterity, eh?
Yes, yes, it's a good thing really 
You can put one on them we've converse for the, put it on for the evening
Well it says if you have to do it when the television's on, we never have the television off   
Put it on at seven o'clock er Emmerdale Farm, but you see when it goes on you feel as though you're tongue tied   all be completely anonymous   these are all same, but they're different
Yeah, well I think those are when, you know, if, if I take one of those with me  and somebody s and somebody er says well why, why are you taping this conversation you know, you, I can give 'em one of those
Yeah  and you won't if, do you, won't have to tell 'em what you're getting for doing it, you're just, you're just doing it for interest so to speak 
Yeah I know 
reckon you're doing it
Well I am actually, I am actually doing it for interest  it's not gonna be easy mind ya
Well it isn't because you've got 
because you've got a something that's absolutely foreign to what we do, we don't er
We'll have to ask Freda and Ken over one night for their suppers
Yeah secretly
Well no you see you can't can ya?
Oh yeah, what oh yes, oh without a doubt Joan, er you can do it, you could have the name and you could have who talked to them and, and then I can tell 'em that what, I've done this you see and that'd be the end of it  it does suggest that you don't tell them before you tell them after and then you sort of give them the opp the opportunity of me knocking, not recording it you see, wiping it off the tape, because it stunts the conversation.
Yeah it does, you see if Ken and Freda or anybody knew they were being televised they'd be careful of what they said
Yeah, if they come up to you with a microphone and say would you like to say a few words for the television programme yourself 
I wouldn't I'd dry up I wouldn't know what to say 
You're like er like butter melting 
If you've plenty of time for thinking about it
Yeah, it really wants to be all written down so you can read it off don't it?
That's right  and can you play that back then to see what it sounds like?
Yes, she was saying was the lady that they erm  er
Where she come from?
She's a local woman, she's a local woman
Is she?
Yes you can play it back although they don't suggest, they don't proposed you do that, because the batteries might not last you see 
Oh yeah 
er, it's only fort the forty five minutes per  per tape, erm per side, er and I think it's after three, three, three tapes you chuck the batteries away and she left another, a load of batteries
Oh my goodness 
so, erm 
she expects you to be busy then all next week doesn't she?
Yeah, well that's true I did, I did say to her, I says well erm  are you interested in performance, I said do you want, you know, is it a lot you want?
Well she said it's up to you how you go on really, you know the more, the more you can do the better or less, see how it works out, cos you don't really know do ya?
You don't really know and they 
And that cos 
suggesting that a couple of days, oh a couple of days is, is enough really, if you, if you get two days out of it
Mm
and what's the, where you can go you see for
Oh well mind you
cos it isn't as though, see if we're at Queensbury we're going to Doreen and Frank's and, and, and that's, that's our, that's our conversation
Yeah, oh aye I can, I can, I can some conversation 
Now if they'd of had Emma with them
Oh, but you see that, that, that doesn't always apply, because if I go into the library and I take it with me and I sit by er, that gentleman who keeps handing me the paper or that lady you know
Mm
who speaks to you, er it's easy enough to just er have the microphone handy that they don't see and just switch the tape on and I'll record what they're saying, come away, see, do it secretly like that, they don't have to know really that they're on tape  and it doesn't really matter, I mean the people who will listen to these tapes are er anonymous you know
Well they, you're anonymous with these an'all aren't ya?
Yeah you are 
That, and where was she going then?
Where was 
She didn't say, because really I were, I were interesting in going in the, in the kitchen you see, cos I knew you 
Did she have a car?
I didn't even notice that, but I did notice her across the road at Mrs   and know so right she'd been there  I just didn't notice where she went, but I heard the bell ring and I could see this anorak through there and me mind thought Mrs , perhaps it's Mrs  but then when I saw this  this lady well  I just didn't know what to think really.
But you see three quarters of an hour, if we, if we, when er Ken, Ken and Freda's an hour and a half, er, it soon goes an hour and a half with company like that don't it?
Mm
And Ken and Freda have plenty to talk about, by God aye, Freda will have anyway 
but you don't realize what's going on do ya in all, in the country?
According to the, the pamphlets here it's, it's government funded  all government funded job 
Ooh you'd think they had nothing else to spend their money on it, I think it's silly, there's enough words in the dictionary 
Good and bad 
What,how you're doing, doing a conversation at home cooking dinner, working and eating in office, serving a customer in a shop, in a car or a bus a train, out shopping with a friend, in a pub 
I can hear ya 
It said John here, it said er  only include people who speak to you
There's not many of them around is there?
don't forget to include your own details  yeah
It's erm
if you, even if you just go in a shop and ask for something, I tell you what I'll send you in butchers with it, for one or two bits and 
He'll talk won't he?
Yes get him talking in butchers or if there's a few in it can be handy for listening to their, won't it?
Yeah
Yeah, I'll send you in the butchers 
Oh it's a bigger 
where would you hide it on you?
oh in me pocket  anywhere
say it's er,in a pub or restaurant er in a shop etc   in a restaurant
cos 
case of a shop assistant and you don't know their name, don't, write don't know on the first line of shop assistant under occupation, only include people who speak to you 
Why?
Oh why you're having to speak, you having to have the other people talking to each other, the people who speak to you 
Oh you don't realize how important speech is and conversation until you, somebody asks you to record it, how much conversation you're, you're involved in.
oh dear 
Oh if you collect some materials she'll give you a pet a gift token for twenty five pounds, goodness gracious me.
oh, oh dear  oh   She said that one, one lady  did a lot of recording and then played it back and listened to herself and didn't like her own voice so she wiped it all off  and handed it in.
Well that's silly because nobody'd known it was her would they?
No exactly, no
You
sound awful there, so
I agree, I don't think you realize how you sound, no 
You don't, no you don't 
Oh dear   anyhow I'll get myself a drop of drink, you say it's seven o'clock do ya?
That's right, mm, mm
Anything you need?
No thanks love, not yet   that's with the conversations, spoken English, guidelines for recording conversations, guidelines for recording conversations     As soon as you've been involved in a conversation, press the record down to start recording  oh yeah these are to show people what you're doing for 
Yeah  well I'll learn to take over and just, just learn
That's right
Will you have one of these love?
Just to
No thank you John, no thank you, would you like one of my chocolates?
Are you having one now?
No I'm alright thank you
Oh I don't want one really  
Trouble is, trouble is you see if you er if you leave her alone you don't know just how she's gonna go on do ya?
No 
Then then the problem is
you're guilty all the time 
Aye that's right 
Yeah if you don't go every day, yes, that's 
once you've start you'll 
yeah 
you've had it 
It's a good job it's not all that far away int it?
I mean 
No, it is 
you spend most of your time like that
she thinks I should do it, you know
How old is she Ken?
Eighty nine going on 
Oh, and you see if you didn't go Ken she'll wonder where you were
Aye
she'll say I wonder where  you were, cos they are like that  aren't they?
And does doctor call regular?
Never comes near
Oh they should do you know 
Aye 
shouldn't they?
They're supposed to go every week 
I don't think they even bother me  for, for
you know what I mean, what can you do about it?
Well if somebody doesn't you know
Mm
I tell you what, car's a bit frozen up this morning 
 
every day
Ah

Mm 
I'm gonna write and say and seeing that they're going to reorganize the way they're gonna collect the community charge, you know, they're gonna do it on houses 
Yeah 
rather than people
Yeah 
I were gonna ask for a reduction in community charge
Yeah

Yeah 
to do with government rather

They've picked the money up
Yeah

Well there's so many of 'em about really 
Well that's asking the question
Yeah, yeah that's right
yes Daily Express 
there's that many of them really, you'd think there'd be 
Yes 
be a, I don't, I don't, I don't think 
that wouldn't of happened in 
No 
any other country do 
No 
nobody er put 
no 
they want eight hundred and fifty odd thousand pounds now and nobody watching them 
Yeah, yeah 
they're comedians

Oh aye

Oh aye
where they're
I've no, I've no excuse for police out 
Yeah 
on its job, no it's 
well 
anybody with intelligence knows
Yeah
who's going this, who, what, who's going to answer if they put a hundred and fifty, a hundred and seventy thousand, five pound down and nobody will watching it being who did it?
I think they'll catch them though, I think they will catch 'em 
It's not a matter of catching them 
No 
I very much doubt they will
Yeah, don't, don't you think they will?
No
No
there's, there's
yeah
the police
Yeah 
but why the hell, money put down and the village in er just outside of Barnsley

They would be working on the kidnapper's instructions, the police?
The police?
Aye
On
aye the, the senior detectives
Yeah
but where were the police?
Mm  but it's sad affair really int it?
Really sad affair 
It wouldn't of happened in America if were
no, wouldn't of happened in Russia either, it wouldn't of happened in Russia 
Yeah 
er 
We can't even, you mean to tell me there's all these bombs keep going off wi it didn't, if it had happened in France  police carry bloody guns
Yeah 
and all sorts
You don't think we're strong enough then, police?
Strong enough?
Yeah
We're not strong enough
cos they did, they work on a softer approach you know the police, they're not, they're not on the hard
They're not strong enough 
No, no 
If a fella walked in here now with a bloody gun I'd
it's er, it's 
it's like America
it save a lot of money er all these pensioners get 'em all shot off  
Aye, now, wait a moment, wait a moment show common sense, if, if, if it'd happen in America in five minutes there'd be a hundred bloody policemen out there
Yeah
with guns
yeah, yeah  I must admit it's a poor do when they know exactly where the criminal's going to be at a certain time and then they let 'em go 
Number of time they can't catch anybody 
they're only going on people's information
Yeah 
it's a big, in this town it's kept quiet, it happened on Monday night  of course there's gonna be a bloody big shake up in Lancashire police, it happened in this town there er, er, er a robbery at a bungalow where an old lady were
Is that right?
Yes, it's been kept quiet
Was anybody injured, anybody hurt?
Well the old woman's in hospital
Er, and it hasn't been reported yet then?
Aye, pardon?
It hasn't been reported in the papers then yet?
No
No
they've, they've not put nothing in the papers
Whereabouts, whereabouts was this happened?
Oh I'm not saying anything 
No 
I know where it's happened
Yeah
yeah.
We've to be on our guard all the time really, we've to be on our guard all the time, all the time 
Lately this town there's more layabouts in this town and some and anywhere in Lancashire  you don't, they're not Lancashire people, oh they're homeless and they live in, in boarding houses at the expense of er the tax payers
Where they supposed to live then?
Yes
Where they supposed to live?
Yeah
drawing income tax 
In boxes 
er yeah drawing social security
yes
Silly old sod
Yeah
where these people supposed to live I wonder 
Just  and get bigger shake up it's ever had in it life who persecutes life, it's coming now, we come  as old as we are.
Mind you it makes you wonder whether the democracy itself is in trouble you know 
Yeah  it's about time it were shaken up now that Labour Party er this government er, erm they're agreeing to this, this has to be done and that has to be done  you put notices up on buses all over Britain no smoking in the buses, now in the big restaurants they're going to have to between now and July put notices up, no smoking in restaurants
I agree with that  I agree with that  
Yes 
mind, I've never smoked in all me life so I don't understand it really, I don't er understand how people suffer really 
Why can't, tell me, this, how this is the intelligence and that, had er 
Well I dunno I think that they would follow if they wanted to roll up they can do they do with 
Aye, do you think so?
I used to smoke heavy
Did ya?
packed 'em up just 
Yeah 
like that
cos I've never smoked you see so I don't really understand
Right
this  the, what makes me laugh is that people's intelligence, they walk along a street shopping and as soon as they walk into a restaurant they sit down and start smoking
Yes, that's one place they shouldn't be allowed 
Yes 
well they're just saying they're gonna put notices up in, first of July 
Well in British Homes Stores' restaurant the rest of them and all them big, they've been putting them up
Well they have smoking areas up in those 
Yeah, yeah 
restaurants like 
Because them who own the restaurant they'll get er they'll be fined on the Common Market laws
That's if we take any notice of them eh?
Pardon?
That's if we take any notice of them
Who?
And the person what's  
our authorities really 
I know and listen 
they won't clean our beaches up 
listen 
really, we won't clean the sea up, we didn't bother with that
Yeah, didn't, you don't  
And water's the same way 
Yeah water's the same way innit?
there's hundreds of French, Germans they're waiting until the first of July and they'll be in this country in a flash.
Well we've, well I, I come originally from Yorkshire
Yeah and then and then  
and we and we were selling er mohair to France, all, all my working life into France we're selling mohair and our
into, into France all my working life
They're blaming, they're blaming
so whether the French come over here or not I think we're quite ready to cope with them here 
they're blaming er parents are blaming school teachers about the kids, now where I live kids are running around up to eleven o'clock at night sometimes, it's not the teachers to blame it's the parents
No, it's educational system that's wrong
Aye,
they live at Silverdale
What were your job?
What did you do?
aye, erm
what did you do as a job?
The youngest has just gone
to school and he can read, the parents are not concerned about reading, mm
I think this system of getting all the children to sit round a table and be taught as a group is wrong, I think they should be taught individually, should have a desk of their own and, and the teacher should stand there and deliver the lesson er to each person  but that's, that's the way it goes
Nine out of every child will be
and how many children in England can speak German?
Well you're painting a very dark picture for us this morning aren't ya?
Well it's true
About old people getting mugged and schools and police in trouble  
Well it, if they're, if they're pointed going to come, if we're going to come a full member of the Common Mark it's no laughing, we laughed, we laughed at bloody Hitler didn't we?
And we nearly come under it er were only for the Yanks.
Well if er, if they'd left it a bit later
What
if the Yanks of left it a bit later they'd of missed all the action
Would they?
Well we couldn't of stopped Hitler 
Ma maybe so, maybe so, but 
Oh you can never mind this country's never won a major war on its own and never will do 
the Americans are the Americans came into the, to the last war to satisfy their own ends 
and that, I'm saying that how it ends 
they weren't bothered about all this
I'm saying that I'm an English member, we've never won a, a major war on its own  look what's, what's happened in, yeah, never won a major war on its own and never will do, there's no nation in the world could beat a German army and, er what would built up
On fear
Yes 
I agree with ya, they'd built 
they went up high 
the army was, it were built up like the er, er Mafia, it were built on fear, yes
there's no constellation to stop each other 
if you didn't do what they wanted to do they did, they did you in, they sent you to Belsen
Japan this cou did this country er good, even though they bombed er Pearl Harbour they did this country a good  a good what's it shall we say
Oh they did, they brought they brought the Americans in, yeah 
they brought the Yanks in, aye, they brought the Yank 
and that that's why the Americans came into the war, they didn't come into the war to look after us, they came in to look after their own interest in the 
No, I know 
into the
well listen
don't run away with the idea that anybody's ever helped us 
listen 
because we have done everything we should of done, we've defended the right all over the world, we went to the Falklands, we, we defended the right in it 
Well why weren't we, aye, well why weren't we ready?
Why ain't we army?
You don't think we'll be chucked out of this library for talking too loud do ya?
Well why, well listen, well why, what the, you tell him
I can't be bothered
tell us why wasn't this country ready
boring people, boring hours, what about the people who are getting the rent off it eh?
What about that?
Sen fancy sending army wagons across to France before Dunkirk, to, to stop bloody tanks, that's how bloody intelligent Britain is.
Is it all wallpapered or?
Most of it, yes, why, what you looking for?

Oh
beside her, and these are twenty five, I said you didn't say that before, oh yes I did he said, I think oh well I'm not wasting my time here arguing with you
Yeah

So I took that, then when I get it home it, it soon
a sight worse then I can tell ya, he did a, a
that was higher than that
Yeah, yeah well it's not so bad is that 
no one end 
isn't it?
you know
No and then you have 
so we settled for that but er, it was an inferior weren't it one we
Yeah
had, but he said it were twenty in the end and then he changed his mind at twenty five so
And are they, are they feather-lined or are they
No, they're er
Ours are feather int it?
Well we have two
Ah
and the, the one that we had before we came here 
the one we had er big bed thirteen tog
That was fifty odd pounds
Yeah
Oh
it's a Fog er Fogarty is it?
Er
Fogarty or something and it's still we duck it down 
Duck down int it?
Mm
and it's, it's thirteen point five tog, that's heaviest
Yeah
it's king size, now that is too warm, we only put that on in winter
Mm
it's too warm in summer isn't it?
But it's amazing
But I mean 
it's amazing how much heating it retains
Yeah 
Er well that, well then we decided to get us, er one for summer and we went on the market and I think, was it a nine tog that's all?
All, it's a very light one
I think it's either nine or six 
Oh I'll tell you where we bought that in market 
Yeah 
and it were, it were nine ninety nine
Yeah
weren't it?
And 
Yeah 
we find that we put that on in summer and it, it feel, keeps us warm even when weather just goes a bit 
Yeah, yeah 
you know dodgy
That was a Sunday market
Aye 
that was a Sunday market
Ah this is a big thick thing it is
Yeah
it's warm enough like
Yeah
I'm not complaining
And, and what is it?
Is it, this one that we've got
It's fibre stuff in it 
Ah this is fibre that we have on this bed
Mind you we find that, we find that other one 
Mind you this is easier, I'm sure it is 
at night alright, that one er
I, I did not show him 
with the, with the fibre and whatnot it's fine, that's alright 
Oh we're warm enough 
Yeah
find it's a real
When I, when I first came out I bought one at er  that'd be about fifty quid somewhere round there, duck down
Yeah
and it's done alright, but all feathers seemed to gone to outside now
Yeah
er, er, although we've shaken it up, we've shaken it up
Yeah
it, they all seemed to stay outside, you know, can't seem to
This, this on the small on the, on the spare 
Oh that's a point in there 
bed, er is a diamond and it's got hollow fibre
Yeah
but I think it's, total value John is only four point five
Now then, er
only point, er, four point five and it's plenty warm enough int it?
Mm
In inside that
You know once you're on that system you've got to have a light one and a heavy one
Yeah
because you've to make arrangements for the weather
Mm, oh that as well we could always put other back in winter, in summer you know
Yeah 
but that one on, that big one  that there is too hot in summer
Oh it's a nuisance an'all 
we keep it on and then we decide oh
 
summer time 
can't sleep with it, so erm, and yet we've found it's fine
Mm
with this last winter 
Mm my feet are sweating now, but, she seems to have a bug in there or summat, cos it's more like a burning than a sweat, it
Yeah
she seems
Mm, I'm not surprised are you?
The way the weather it's changing
No I
It's very changey
Well it's mild this morning isn't it?
gonna be warmer today anyway it says
Yeah
lighter on the showers, it's gonna ease off
Mm
that's their forecast anyway
Well which market did you get it from?
I mean 
Main market erm, but he er, I didn't like him like er
They all at top 
They're not genuine are they?
they all at top, you can get it up easy enough can ya?
Well I had a go at it and it, well knowing
 
Yeah, yeah 
it's inside cover it doesn't
Yeah
can't see 
What quantity is it?
Is it oh two yard 
Quite a big spread, no it's about that big a diameter and
Yeah
it's obviously scraped on summat
Yeah
it's not bad, it's, it's, but we know it's there that's the only thing 
Yeah remember that morning we bought ours it was in summer and it was a, a Pakistani girl
It was, yes
er 
she looked er, she looked really to be new at the job 
I've never seen 
Yeah
very young and
she's not there now
No
the stall's not there now, and all the thick one and thins are all alike
Mm
nine ninety nine well I supposed it's not to miss 
And they're all good quality 
if it only lasts twelve months
all good quality they looked didn't they?
Yeah and clean very clean, yeah
But it's a matter of look 
Well they were wrapped up weren't they?
it's a matter of look when you go in the market
Yeah
Oh it is int it, yeah 
er if you go to er, er a major store, if you go to Marks and Spencers, somewhere like that, it's on a return basis, but with the market it's a little bit here today gone tomorrow 
That's it, that's it 
They're like gypsies aren't they?
but you can be lucky you see I mean 
Yeah 
we were lucky with that, with that er, with that one 
Oh yes yeah 
very fortunate
Well I wouldn't of taken first one back I er, I mean, it was, wouldn't of bothered me, it wouldn't, had spots that were on it
Yeah
but this is worse mind than that was, but you can, it's obviously oil where that, that she said was blood that 
And what tog is it?
Thirteen
Yes
Mm and that, that's it 
Yeah that, that's right it is it's like Howard in, as same as Howard's, well she really wanted  
Oh yeah well we had a blanket on an'all and we took that off
Yeah 
Well the, that, I should think so an'all by God 
but you know that one what Pauline has on her bed when we go, that's only thin
Very, very light
but you know we, we might feel cold when we get in at first, oh we haven't been in long before it's warm isn't it?
Warm I just said 
No, no if you use them as they should be used they're alright
Mm
but er Freda would have a blanket on in winter with that, it wasn't necessary you know
Yeah
cos the nearer it is to you the, the warmer it is 
Are you sure you won't have a coffee Ken?
Yes I'm alright thanks, I'm alright
When you're on blankets and you've been brought up on blankets er you're used to blankets
Mm
and I, I always felt if we have a change onto this er new system of er, of these quilts, I, I you know, I weren't too sure, but once you've changed I don't think you'd ever want to go back because in winter time when it's a bit cooler and you put more blanket on to keep warmer and then it becomes heavy
Yeah
Oh I know they 
but with this system they're not weight weighty at all, no 
No, no 
and I've long feet you see and if I put have me feet straight up like that it er it's pressure on it 
 
But them, them old blankets we had some because we need them when they come, I fold 'em 
Yeah 
and put 'em on camp beds 
Yeah 
ooh they are heavy them blankets 
Mm, mm 
and you know we used to have about four on didn't we at Queensbury 
Aye 
John?
Yeah 
Used to get up feeling tired
Yeah
I never
And wash it, and washing them was another problem innit?
Ah it is it is, it's terrible because I don't think you can get, I don't know whether you can get a, I couldn't get one in my other washer but then
Well you'll get one in 
yeah probably would 
wouldn't you get one in that Princess that you got at first?
Oh yeah, but not in me 
No, no 
not in me twin tub I couldn't
No
Betty 
I remem 
used to take 'em and wash 'em for me
when I first got married I er, well not first
she went in hospital for something or other
when she had this
before that, maybe when the scrapers or whatnot, I thought I'd do a job here I'll wash blankets
and I put 'em in near boiling water didn't I?
Oh I know there's wool in that
And the stink 
I wouldn't of known that I'd of done that 
Yeah 
the stink, urgh 
I'd of done that 
John would I don't think he knows 
I'd of done that 
what to put in there do ya?
The smell was awful and oh we er give a really good  blankets like
Yeah
yeah really good wool blankets, ooh heck
Cos they last forever don't they?
Aye they, they would of done 
They would of if you hadn't put them in a boil wash 
It was just like a boil,it was a big double it went to about single  don't laugh
Wool is the best, it's the best warming commodity there is
Yeah
it is with clothes it's erm 
Yeah, yeah 
if you get wool in clothes 
carpets, clothes anything 
Yeah 
It were real they were really good blankets my mother had bought them for us for er er wedding present 
Mm, yeah that's, that's a good present isn't it?
Aye

Well Hartleys the er, the knitting wool people of Keighley the er, his son I soldiered with him
Mm
there were one or two lads in our unit who were sons of er, of er manufacturing, one was er Crawford Biscuits you know, I soldiered with him and I don't know if you remember er erm, er but anyway, Frank, Frank at Keighley of course when I got, when we got married he, he came up and got us these blankets didn't he?
Well he used to visit didn't he?
Aye he did he used to visit yeah, well we lost contact with him really
Well you do over the years cos all ya 
Yeah you do really 
and he never got married did he?
And he had a different life from us I think 
Oh a different life totally
they, they, they went in different circles from others 
Yeah 
and they're loners and he were very nice though 
And when you've got a fam 
weren't they John?
and when you've got a family anyway er
You don't you don't 
you tend to drift away don't ya?
Yes you do 
I was big mates with a lad at  near Gatehead, Skipton you know?
Yeah
But over the year we've drifted apart  they had a family, we had a family 
By lord that's a grand place 
What, oh  we used to go regular up on a Sunday didn't we to ?
Oh Christ the Railway Hotel at  
Yeah
Railway Hotel
that's right railway do you remember?
What did they call your mate then at ?
Ben 
 
Oh no, no 
cos erm we knew somebody called Jack  there a cricketer 
He used to play cricket for Queensborough
his father had a public house in Keighley and then, then er when he got married Jack he bought a little business in Keighley which didn't do so well, so then he went and lived in 
Yeah
down Shady Lane
Ah that Shady Lane I know
It's a 
mind you 
lovely little place
my mate lived down that area then he, he moved up to far end Keighley end
Yeah
there's a row of houses right on, by top
On the, yeah there is 
right at the far end 
at the at the other, other side 
Yeah, yeah right at the far end
Yeah
well they're kinda er half semi half terraced they are there 
Yeah 
there maybe three in a block or summat like that, er he took second from far end and their lawn is high up, up the road you know 
Mm 
Yeah 
so he dug up the lawn and put a little garage in
That's good, that's 
Mm 
clever
on his own like
Had to move some stuff there then 
Yes 
He, he, well it was a council house when he moved in and he come to me  what'd be, ten, twelve years since he says, I've chance to buy that house he says, they want fifteen thousand he says what do you think?
I said grab that house up sharp
Mm
he said do you think so?
I said too true, get hold of it 
It's a new area as well yeah
And the view is terrific
Yeah
it looks right out on valley you know
Mm
and the
right on down that valley  anyway he bought it and he
it seemed a lot for buying a council house
Yes
but in the position it was and everything 
Oh yes and now, mm
so he got it and it's a real cracker it is, real good house
Mm
the area as well, we've had lots of picnics there aren't we?
Yes, well it weren't far from where we lived 
Yeah 
it didn't take long did it?
About quarter of an hour at most I think 
When we started to go there at first there were a fella, a fella from Keighley who was a weaver and he bought a bit of land at the side of the er, the side of the chapel, or was it the school?
What's it, a chapel or school?
It was a gate road wasn't it?
It's opposite the park you go, you go into  
Yeah 
the park's on your left
Yeah
and it's the first road on your right
Yeah
and it's either a school or a chapel there, to you, on your right
Mm
just before the road forks
Mm
and er, you go up that land there and we went quite regularly for picnics there, cos we had, we loved it there
Well you used to go fishing there didn't you?
Yes
In 
er one of the
well he bought the land and we saw him at different times build his bungalow it's a lovely bungalow now int it?
Yeah it went right from 
Mm
from start
Er and his son helped him but I think in later on there were a little bit of disagreement with, with regards to who, how much work there was and, but anyway they'd finished the bungalow and er it's grand yes 
It ought to be it's his house hadn't he?
But if you go down that road even further there was er a, a couple there bought one of the houses and er 
An old one 
yeah and I don't know what they give for it but it would it would be very reasonable but it's 
They wouldn't give a lot because it was in a bad 
a lovely situation, yeah
Of course people are doing that now
Well they are 
buying old houses aren't they?
And doing them up 
Eh up, oh aye 
Yeah
and that's, that's er
Well
look at that couple up, in the
lakes there, they're, they've bought  a barn that been done up
Yeah 
and it was already done up like and er
Mm, mm
they bought it and moved in and now Planning are saying that it, it wasn't a
place, they pulled it down and rebuilt it so it has to come down
Ooh
and they've bought it
oh dear 
Oh dear that's terrible int it?
Mm  can try and but look
couldn't it?
Come that way er like, they don't seemed to be giving it to 'em, and it was nothing to do with them, they bought it and, and they would have a search done as the reason when you buy houses aren't there?
I'd say I'd say that 
Problem here you know it's solicitors that's wrong 
 
Oh it's the solicitor that's wrong 
Solicitor's wrong, yeah I mean that's what you pay 'em for really 
Mm yeah and apart from that the bloke that sold it must have known cos he 
He probably, that's why he's, probably why he sold it  
I think it was in his er his agreement when he made it 
 
that it was only er a face up, it weren't to pull down and rebuild
They're nice these houses that we've said haven't we John?
We wouldn't like to live in them now at our age
No
the two, we go, I mean
Yes

There is, yeah

She said I ain't doing anything I'm just boiling potatoes, she said what went crack?
She said I don't know, she said there's nothing to crack
is it really
Mm
well they'd of been here thought of been desperate for that wouldn't you?
Yes that's right and it was, that night it was leaking like
Mm
so it was a bit of er struggle to er, to get them to come and look at it and fix 'em up again, well they didn't fix 'em up they, they, they give 'em a new one, they only got it in the sale
Yeah 
Mm 
but er  they
but this time everything was happy, marvellous 
Well Pauline's a devil for punishment I would say, she's got both lads at school now you know and she's home all day and she isn't one for sitting around Pauline
No
she likes plenty, you know, and er, she did take a course on baby minding and she passed everything like, she could baby mind
Mm
but she had, they have to have a fence built from the back garden, because there's, there's an opening from the back garden and it's onto the drive and then it's onto the road, even though it is a quiet road
Mm
so she's er, she's waiting for 'em to come to do that, anyway she's er, somebody rang her didn't they and they asked her if she'd have a little boy of four months old, Thursdays and Fridays all day  and she started this week with him, so  I said well Pauline 
Four months old?

She did, if she'd of been married I think, she was, she wasn't 
Younger

Aye 
got these two, I think she would of had because she loves children
Oh she has enough certificates to of gone to teachers' training college, now that, I always feel although I think she's quite happy now, but for myself, for myself and I'm always er tempted by the fact that they always have twelve weeks' holiday you know, I mean in one go the teachers 
Yeah, yeah 
I think she would of been better as a teacher, because as Joan says she is er very taken up with looking after children
Mm
very much so
But she went in a library and got the certificate in the library 
Aye, yeah well she, she was, you know there's a period of time where they, they sort of leave the grammar school and the, and the, they don't just know what they, what's gonna happen

Mm
so she got the job and she was quite happy really
Mm
but them lib 
You're not gonna worry about a saucer are ya?

so I went back and a bit later the phone went, er the Bill from the publisher he was, but he also did a bit for one of er diaries or summat like that
I know
you see, can you give me any information?
So I told him all I found out like, when he came down a few days later he gave me two fifty, er two pound ten as it was then you know  I was amazed at
Yes
all I thought like I was passing a bit of gossip, but he paid me for it
he said any time you see anything or hear anything that's of value at all, come and tell us and we'll pay you every time
That's very good int it?
Mm, mm
What's that the Dalesman?
Well he was Dalesman editor, but 
Dalesman editor, mm 
it wasn't for the Dalesman it was for er 
Yeah 
some local paper or even, might of been Daily Express or summat like that you see
Mm
er they were agents for these papers for any news
Yeah
Oh I knew Dalesman editor very well
Well strange enough we have a connection with the Dalesman editor
Mm
it's only a very tenure, but it is there  a neighbour of ours were very er keen on looking after animals, er stray animals and all like that Emma , Emma , well she was also a poet, er
She'd write poems
Mm
however, however, however you judge these things are entirely up to those who are right and those who are receiving them, but I thought she was very good, she wrote some poems about us really
Yeah
er just after the course, which described, described 
It was all described in  she'd go to these
Mm
affairs and stand up and recite them
Oh yeah 
Yeah yeah
She was so good 
Well she used to write she used to send these to the erm Dalesman man, that's right the Dalesman, yeah that's right 
Yeah mm editor Dalesman 
That's right and she'll, and er, and he what, he didn't er, he didn't take to her I don't think
Well it, I think he kept some, but in, he didn't, she didn't get paid a certain price 
No you, you she wasn't
No, there was some funny business about it she wasn't very cheap 
Well can I say 
Yes
So I would just say you would like to know the opening times please
Cos I remember once when they asked me at work to deliver the annual speech you know  the man that asked me he says er, you know, they've gone round everybody else and nobody else would do it and would I do it, and I said good lord, that were my first reaction, and I realized like all the company secretaries lo lord, so I did very well there
didn't I?
I got the right 
No I would just ask, say, you know, just say you want to make enquiries, cos they're going to be open on the second of April
Yeah
and if, you could say that you've got last year's opening times 
Er as long as the weather's decent really, I know we're only gonna go for three days so
Where
going to stay?
Well at Alberston
At Alberston
it's not very far away and then we're gonna go from there to er  there are one or two other places around worth looking at
Yeah
erm  so we'll see how it goes, anyway thank you very 
You're welcome 
thank you very much for your information
You're welcome
and I'll mention your name to him, when I have a word with him
I'd better be moving
Yeah, well fair enough Ken
gonna do wonders this morning I ain't done nothing 
No well I didn't do anything yesterday 
No, good, no, no change me mind about them
them togs and whatnot
Aye
it were Joan really that put me right there it were thirteen as opposed to fifteen
Yeah cos they don't go any higher 
Yeah, cos Freda said Freda decided er
they don't go any higher I 
No 
don't think
she can't, she didn't see a fifteen
No, they not go any higher John
No she got a thirteen anyway
but that four, that four point five we had was plenty warm 
Mm 
enough
Yeah
It's not feather
Well Freda reckons this, that feather of ours is beginning to stick together and they're not, well I suppose pillows are 
Yeah 
are like that, but pillows have your head sweating on 'em at times aren't we?
Yeah
Erm when it's hot, they do go a bit peculiar in pillows, they go stained don't they?
Yeah
I don't think pillows keep you warm
Well I think you want to, with pillows you want to be changing them every now again don't you?
Oh yeah definitely 
 
aye they're
Mm
we  what we did once we, we got some more
and changed it, it were a waste of time
Yeah 
cos it it were just as bad after
Yeah
the feathers have a certain length of life and that's it, they've had it, and it isn't worth the mess anyway
There's a lot to that fibre isn't there now?
This
You do get a lot of fibre now 
yes, the, yeah well, well it's like a spongy now 
Yeah yeah
Yeah
We have two that belonged to me mother and they're very good
Yeah
they don't lose their
No, no 
bounce at all 
Mind you, mind you, that, the, the, I think the, those that you're talking about Joan
The good ones the not, the cheap 
they are firm 
Yeah
they are firm and I think that you have a feather one haven't you?
Well I always have a feather one and I, I have 
Yeah 
two pillows and I'm not bothered about underneath
Yeah 
No 
but I always like a feather for me head
Yeah I think feathers are more yielding aren't they?
Well I've er, I've er fibre I've a fibre underneath and a feather cos, when I had a fibre I don't know why, but me ears seemed to be deaf every morning
Yeah
Mm
and they seemed bunged up you know 
Yeah 
seemed er, as I've washed my head and it wasn't getting out with
Yeah
I mean
Mm 
on this anyway I, I finally, I didn't like it at all, but now I'd done, I have me feather back I'm alright  I was like deaf when I got up every morning.
We went er, since we've came here we went to stay with Edith when her husband died, we went to stay overnight 
Oh blimey 
oh, and they'd been married, what she's ten years older than you had been married 
Yeah, yeah 
nearly fifty years hadn't they?
Yeah would of been yeah
and they'd the same bed that  that they'd got married in
Yeah
They, they were probably given to them secondhand an'all 
Look I'm not joking it, it was the same mattress and it was a flock mattress one of them
Oh  
you used to ba you used to check it and go like that  
Check it  
move it over
get off 
and the pillows were flock as well 
Yeah
and, and she's ever so nice is Edith, but I mean 
Oh wonderful

No
it's just their way, it's a way I mean 
m=Mm, mm 
everybody has different ways don't they?
Yeah 
Very kind, very clean 
And she's asked us to go and stay and I said to John I Wouldn't stay in that bed again
Well you you get 
cos you get 
up and ya ooh 
ooh but your head still on the pillows, I'm not too bad on the, on the mattress, but I must have something
Yeah yeah 
soft underneath, might it John terrible 
Terrible is you, you just can't, you can't describe to people 
No you can't 
No, no
unless you, you know 
Mind you we slept
Mother-in-law was 
we, we had the night 
I was shattered weren't we, but we
mother-in-law always had them flat beds you know and
Yeah it's 
you're alright like, you could make yourself a nest in 'em and you was 
Yes I know  
you're like a bloody mole 
Aha and that's a good description is that
But when you made 'em, you, like kneading bed didn't ya?
Oh aye, yeah, you used to shake it up and then bash it about and, er
And we once went to Scotland, then breakfast in it, when Pauline was with us didn't, weren't it John?
Aye
All them years since, and she was a widow and, and she was er ever so nice, lovely home and clean, but the bed was, it, it wasn't just flock it were part Taylor 
Was it her that baked for us as well?
Aye
Did she bake for us
well she were nice, well they were all nice at that time 
Aye they were 
weren't, when you went bed and breakfast in 
Yeah 
they took ya in, into their home and, and they made you feel like part of the family 
That's right, yeah 
they 
Wed Wednesday morning Joan now so, this is me er  I've only two days really to get some more recordings 
That's right, yes, mm
I shall, I'm gonna take that letter on and come back here, just out to post
Okay
Are you going down now?
Yes, well I'll have to, I'll have to just get me boots on
Yeah, okay, well I'll wait and I'll go, well I'll post it in the centre 
I mean originally where we came from you know they er, the snows and er and the cold weather we were eleven hundred feet above sea level
Where was that at?
We were at Queensbury  it's 
We 
it's near, near Halifax anyway in Yorkshire 
Oh it's at Queensbury I didn't know
on the Pennines
On the Pennines it would be I know 
You're not from this area though are ya?
No Cumberland
Ah
Cumbria
Oh
I've, I've er
Morning 
Morning 
Morning, it would be, be cold up there
Well we, as I say we were eleven hundred feet above sea level and er and we were, really moved here because er I could not stand the er, the bad weather
No
er, I mean, I worked near er the factory where I worked was near 
Aye 
to where we live so it was convenient to stay there
That's right
while I were working
Yes
and I said as soon as we got the opportunity of moving away we would do, and we searched all over the erm, when it come to, went into Lincolnshire, went into Wales
Aye
we went up to Yo er Bridlington and all like that and then we 
y=Yes and here 
finally plumped on this really
Yeah and yet you're never
cos you've a good house as well 
Aye it is a good one, yeah, it's very similar as I was telling my friend the other day to what we had before
Yes
er the house itself is better
Yes
it's just the surround, although we have more surround, well no not more surround here, but it's a different layout
Yeah
as other surround, as other house was better cos we had lawns all the way round you see 
Oh I see 
but it was still a semi like this
That's right 
Mm 
Yes it's er
we were lucky to get this because chap er wanted to get out into a house really and he had one offer er from down south and they'd put in and looked and they er  and they sort of bo hadn't followed it up, so
No  well houses today they are stuck like
They are aren't they?
Aye 
Oh I think anybody that's wanting to sell to move is, is in trouble really
Aye, oh they are like 
Yeah 
to buy a
Not too bad 
Have you had 
Done your shopping?
trouble with your car?
Have you had a painted wing?
Er it's the undercoat
Ah
erm, he's seeing to a bit of rust for me
Yeah
so, that's the undercoat, but God knows when it'll get erm sprayed properly cos you've got to have some decent weather 
Who will look, who will yeah, who have done that for ya?
Oh Martin
Martin is, ah 
Yeah 
It's not an easy job that you know
No, no, he's very good with cars though 
no 
he knows, well he knows 
no 
a few bits you know
I know that whenever I've tried to put paint on any cars that we've ever had, it's never looked right has it?
No no 
No 
And it's a professional job 
you need to know what you're doing don't ya?
Yeah 
professional's job
Well he, he borrows like, well he's gonna borrow like a compressor off this 
Yeah 
other guy, you know, he does it in garages, he's done it quite a few times before on cars he's had himself, so
Oh it's a technique, a relation of ours used to be a car sprayer
You did Pauline's once didn't you?
I did 
When she were at home
and it was perfect weren't it I do for her 
It was, beautiful 
and then we had an accident with our car door, who we took it up to erm, up to Carnthruft there and they did it for us and it, it, it's just disappeared as a hole innit?
Oh yeah
Or the dent
Yeah
it's, it's worth, they're worth doing when, when you get any damage
Well if you don't cover rust 
or rust 
up it gets worse and worse yeah 
That's it yeah, make sure they're quite all free from rust 
And yours yours is out in all weathers isn't it?
Yeah
So you 
he's got a few bits, there's still another few bits to be done you know but it just looks such a mess 
Do you need the light on?
Do you need the light on?
Yeah I think you will just pop it on then  just looks such a mess when you're going round a bit like that but I'm afraid 
 
it'll have to do
Oh they're nice looking cars them aren't they?
They're okay, I think they're a bonny little car
Yeah
you know as far as little cars go, yeah
Mind you I'm all in favour of small cars  aren't we Joan?
We like small ones rather than 
Yeah 
rather than big ones 
Yeah 
they're better for parking aren't they small ones?
Oh yeah, yeah 
You can't park, a big car's an advantage if you're going a long way
Yeah, yeah definitely
but small cars are marvellous in Lancaster and
We would have er, a smaller than one we have wouldn't we?
Oh we would 
The caravan not as 
yeah we would 
Mm
not as powerful anyway
How 
Well 
much d'ya want?
Erm, quite a lot off the top you know so that I can just brush it up
Yeah
and er, not, I don't want the back of me ears showing there
Right, you don't
er, and if you, not quite as short as you did last time, you see when you combed it up last time it was right up to the top just a little bit 
You want it to cover 
Yeah I don't mind 
cover it up 
a little bit, but really it was, you know, you know how it does it, it springs up doesn't it?
Yeah 
Er  and er, and coming over different like you've done, like you know it's round
Right 
Yeah that looks super
What's that then?
that painting
Oh 
It's as flat as any, any, you know there's no, no irregularities in it at all 
Are you going to get the same colour as your car then?
Oh yeah you can, you can usually match it up, yeah
You've gotta be careful 
Ah cor that's an expert job is that
Oh I'll tell him that  
Oh well he 
yeah it is 
will be pleased to know  if you tell him that 
Well I've, the number of times I've tried to paint it, paint it, it just doesn't work, I've even had those small cans you know
Yeah
you know, but, you, not only have you got to get the right colour and everything, you've got to hold it the correct distance away from the metal
That's right, yeah 
you've got to keep your hand moving  er  but there's a temptation to try to er put more on so that it is thicker you know, but it doesn't work that way you know 
Yeah 
it's, it's fair do all together  anyway I can't see me ever painting a car again
Hmm
no, the mess
get 'em done for ya, you used to do a lot didn't you er car maintaining you used to do it all 
Yeah I took a course on car maintenance
Mm
Very handy as well, that's a good idea
It came in very handy for you
Well it did because once you know we went over the moors
Mm
and we parked up er the top side of Malham and the car wouldn't start
Oh hell
so, you know, I looked under the bonnet, I couldn't understand it at all tt, er, so I eventually got a lift and got a ride down into Malham and er, went in the telephone box there
Mm
and rung the A A, so as I got through to the A A man I says erm, you know, I says I, where I was parked and all like that and where I was stood and the chap says oh I'll get a, a van up to ya as soon as I can, but I says wait a minute, I says my car's just arrived  and Joan was the mechanic, he lifted bonnet up and touched something  and you  brought it down didn't you?
Oh did you?
Yeah 
Yeah
I don't know how I'd dared drive down them narrow roads 
No 
Yes I did, it started going, I don't know what I did but it started going it started 
Well when we got it home I realized it was the battery lead that was just a little bit of lead 
Oh that's all it can be 
Yeah
something silly like 
Yeah 
in fact I'd say eight times out of time that's all it ever is
Yeah
something silly you know 
Yeah 
like your, your plug leads are, just one's popped off or something or it's gotta bit loose something like that 
The A A man did laugh didn't he?
Oh you wouldn't hear him cos I had the phone 
No, no well
oh he did laugh, he said you'll never live that down
 
 
Anyway so we went 
You both wandering 
You want a start 
down in the car
Ah, so we rode home and that was it delighted
I bet you felt a right mechanic then didn't you?
Yeah 
It's magic touch you've got to have with cars
Mm 
Mm 
I know a lot more about cars than I have, I, I never used to know nothing about cars but 
Yeah 
just watching Martin and seeing what you're doing and
Yeah
you know, if the worse comes,tr putting your jump leads on and things like that
Mm
I mean I didn't even know how to do anything like that really 
No 
but it's all very, very handy to know
Well it pays you to know
Oh it does 
because you're out in it aren't you all day?
Yeah 
Well that course I went on you know, there was er, there were, there were, there'd be about twelve in the class and there were two young women in the class
Yeah 
er
Cos I think there's more women drive now than ever they used to 
Yeah 
Oh yeah  and of course you've got to be a bit careful as well when you hear all these things on the motorway 
Oh 
and whatnot, haven't you?
I say 
So that's probably why they go in for more of these courses things 
But you can get very dirty messing about with cars
Oh yeah, I know he gets black I'm sure 
Could you could you change a tyre Louise?
Could I change a tyre?
Mm
No, no
 
You'd just have to look
Well I'm saying no, but I've er 
stand at side of car and look sad and pitiful  
 
and somebody might stop then 
Well actually I'd, I would know how to do it, but whether I'd have the tools on me or not, just jack it up on one of them thingies
Yeah
and then erm 
One of them thingies  
one of them thingies, one of them jacks, and then  you've got one of them, I don't even, I don't know what they're called but I've seen it before 
Well er thingies and articles and whatnots they're all 
 
they're all valuable tools them 
As long as you know what the whatnots is 
Yeah as long as you know what they're used for
Yeah
then 
That there and, you know
Well yeah I suppose really I would be able to
Thingy  
if, if I was really stuck and I had the, the tools, which, I wouldn't have you see, but if I did have the tools there, then yeah I would be able to do it  cos I've seen Martin doing it quite a few times, so
Mm
Oh
Yeah jack it up take the, the bolts off, pull it off, put it back on again and screw it up.
Russell's wife across here does it, don't she Joan?
Oh yes she seems very good she's very efficient isn't she?
She gets her head in the bonnet and
Yeah
fiddles about with it
Yeah, she does  very efficient
Still I can look efficient underneath that bonnet, but whether I am or not  anybody can, anybody can  
 
Anybody can 
I know
I mean even me I could if I lifted it up
Oh style is half the job int it really?
Oh yeah, looking as if you know  the business  
Right I'll leave you to it
Yes okay, right, a bit better when you see me
No deliveries yet then for 
No it's er it came today and it had its balance on its ticket and I've rung them up and er 
Yeah 
it's due in the middle of next week
Oh good
Yeah
I, er, I think when we get it as well I'll ask Steven to come and put it on because it's er 
Right 
it needs drilling doesn't it?
It'd probably need drilling 
Yeah through the tiles that's right surface mounted
Aye that's right, cos I'm not, I haven't got the equipment really to 
No it it is a bit of a job
Yeah
just in case you crack a tile
And if you crack a tile 
That's right 
you're worse off still aren't ya?
That's right absolutely
That's right, yeah, it's a great attraction
You can do as you please
Yeah, yeah 
do what you want if you wanna buy summat have it, don't feel 
Yeah 
it pull a bloody big  just let it give yours paper have a little bit of
here and there you know 
That's right yeah, aye if you go back into the system where they had at Blackpool where er Reginald Dixon used to play
Mm
for where they are 
 
and people used to go and see it and go and enjoy them and if you want to erm, if you went into Wales and on that way there was, who was it, it's Albert  you know
Yeah, aye
yeah  you know you used to go in, no it's Scarborough
well the, we used that bandstand there 
Yeah 
it's in  Park now in Manchester 
What?
What?
bandstand
What's gonna happen to that now?
Every Sunday pull it down, every Sunday bloody night and Saturday afternoon, bloody bandstand were going
Yeah
good hour, let's all sit round listening to bloody band on a Sunday night  it's only to, Lancaster to go in bar for twenty five pound, there were five to
is that right?
Aye, I'm going back a lot of years ago
I don't know 
I don't know 
yeah 
Aye, aye not
Anyway, we, our
independent is jacked it in so
somebody or other's gonna take it over, gonna try and get 
Aye 
in now Conservative, so, but you see 
possibly 
whatever you want, whatever you want to do, whatever you suggest to your councillor it never gets anywhere, it never gets anywhere
Who'd be on the, who would be on the bloody council with any real bloody business initiative
Well I, I
I mean when I was a boy young Willy Carton all the business men of the bloody town
Yeah
you heard they'd get something for themselves but you heard they'd get the town something an'all
I agree with that I agree with that 
your public earning not a lot of bloody
I agree with that 
how can a man run a town when he got to go er, to work for a fucking boss
Aye, yeah
seven days a bloody week, how can he?
He can't, he can't, yeah, no, no 
D'ya know what I mean?
Where's his brains ah?
Eh?
Well there is definitely something wrong because, because a place like this 
Something wrong 
should, should attract visitors and things should be going and I don't care how much 
You have, you have you have the bonny little bay in England
Exactly, well you 
I mean 
you can come here and you can er you can travel up
 
travel anywhere , anywhere, yeah
if wanted to go further south
Exactly  I don't know what the job is
But it makes you wonder how it's all gonna finish up really whether there's gonna be a bust up or what or
Well I shall tell ya
how they gonna, how are they gonna go on with this sale of land that the council have sold some land to the council and the police have been looking into it 
Well I don't know what that is eh, just a bit of weird, weird job innit?
Aye it is 
He said he won't tell will he what he's done
Oh well  you see
he was doing
he's been able to get round it really, it might well be above board, but the police have been looking into it
Well I would think it wouldn't be half, but then I don't know owt about it so it's no good me saying, but  take, taking the type of the woman 
I, I think 
I would think it would be above board
I, I, I think it, it, were short of some honest dealers now
Oh definitely
I mean there's a lot of dishonest dealers, a lot of people
Oh
in it for a, for a couple of years to get as much as they can and get a 
 
little shop here and they charge as much as you can and they get the grant to open the shop up and then they close it down a couple of months
But look at where they
aye, that's right, yeah, yeah
You think they'd have a
or what?
If I bought a thing I wouldn't want another man
and, and, and look at responses
 
No, no no that's true
Stop gabbing 
When I bought oh hiya
alright?
When I, when I bought bloody
you never
to help me out did ya?
No, no
You bought it and bought it, that's it, not same as they do with yeah  with them looking for bloody sponsors unheard and them looking for bloody sponsors  eh?
Aye that's right I mean you want 
 
bubble, there's only one thing wrong with it, I said to my lad many a time  I said the trouble is with the world today everybody wants too much money for doing what they have to do, that's why things are dear
Er, I agree with ya, I agree with ya 
that's what it is 
Yeah they do that
There's only one lot of bloody people ever started this and that's the bloody union
I agree again I totally agree with ya 
that's what has started it 
it's a bit double sided really 
 
I mean some of the
How are ya?
Oh not so bad
You're looking well 
No wonder the women get tired having to crouch them up and down like that
She didn't know me, I know her well
Ah
she just lost her husband and that was why I never said 
Oh dear, it's bad luck that int it?
Yeah, it happens to everybody you know
Aye it does
the other way round an all some times
but that's what's the, that's the trouble I think with the council today.
I mean the council in our house today, the council and he's told the other council, one isn't working, well he's on a good job somewhere, he said well what's one hundred and twenty pound a week?
Yeah
One time
Yeah
so the other guy said ooh er, ooh er, he can't
 

He said I wish I had a hundred and twenty pound a week
Right
I said that's done with you a bloody lot I said, a hundred and twenty pound a week that should be able to make do with a hundred and twenty pound a week easily 
Easily 
Eh?
Eh?
easily, easily, easily easily 
But then again you see they go out they think nothing of spending forty quid up there at the place on Friday night, Saturday night
Well they're talking about 
 
talking about children getting five pound a week spending money
Oh  Saturday penny, Saturday ha'penny
We used to come here
Oh yes
on that bottom end down by the back there, we used to have a full weekend, me and wife and youngster for a fiver
Nine of 'em
Yes and you   used to give us a lovely meal every night 
Aye 
an'all, five pound
Aye lovely
People can't understand that can they?
Bed and breakfast half a crown
Oh well there you are you see
bed and breakfast half a crown, aye
we stay, when we we're in Yorkshire all 
Oh 
the apprentices in, in mill where we were, we were all bound together
Aye
we'd go down the station, went pub, there's er, I think were two and seven pence I'm not right sure, but that is worth by
the prize money down, and there were a trip planned, you'd to go from Queensbury and you used to go through to Blackpool
Ah
and then it used to turn back half past four in morning
Well it would do
train, train never went back it always went so far and stop
Yeah
then it went a bit further and stop, and then we used to be walking up the, but that were it, half a crown
You could go to Bradford from here
That's it
stop at every station couldn't we?
Aye that's, right, that's it, that were us  
Half a crown and met and sixpence to get in
and half a crown

How do ya qualify if you see people er at 
Yeah 
our age who's saved up, er how d'ya qualify that price with today's prices, cos every pound you save then, is er, is worth nowt today is it?
That's
When I was on the
this morning, I went across there and I got ice cream
that's right, yeah
When I was a lad I could have seventy for them, I sat on there and I licked it up, er, a good afternoon, I was just having a break by sands, I said when I was a lad I could have seventy ice creams
That's right yeah
right
Yeah, it is the price of one it's unbelievable it is unbelievable, yeah 
It is innit?
it's all because of this change of money you see and then when we get on to the new
you'll, it'll go wrong again
Mm
it'll go wrong again 
no, you know you won't
No
Well aye, we just carry on, we just enjoy what we, what we want to do and er, we don't bother
I mean, me and wife walk up and down here
Oh
and Joan says well I'm not bothered about pier, I'm not bothered, we like this bay and we can do what we like
That's it, yeah
and that's all there is to it, but you can work yourself
if you want to
Oh you could, yeah
but it just means having trouble with er windows, er smoking house you know
Do what?
The, the windows, smoking house
Oh have ya?
What's up with ya?
Well  they might be a friendly, oh I don't really know but er  he's so busy you see and he's busy all kinds of day and night, now then, we asked him a while ago to be more careful when he was switching on the freezer units at night because they were waking people up, we asked him er a while ago if he'd be more careful learning up at six o'clock in the morning because the chain and that we couldn't sleep in the morning like, and all disturbing us all like that
Aye, aye
anyway we, we had a petition that when it came up that er, that the new E E C rules were coming in that they would, they'd going to have to have a clean way if you are you are and a dirty way out you know 
Oh yeah 
er other way round and you
with a psychopath
Aye
now then the E E C said this should of happened so we, we got a petition up and I thought, we got, well I didn't but the lads got over two hundred signatures and they must of been er two letters went to the Corporation  and everyone was talking er critical
Aye
and all was accurately, now if it was done really with the hope that the council and winder would get together and come to some decent arrangement and at the other side of er Lancaster er down by the
down there
Right
behind the
behind the hillside
 
well that was for sale, that part it belongs to the council
Aye
Now then, if the council could, could've come to some agreement and put in there, it would of made it right for us, now, you see we've done so before, this is what I don't like about  he, he applies for planning permission does er  the notice was no bigger than six inches long and four 
No 
inches high and it were
That's Mike  bouncer
Oh is it  oh I didn't know about that 
we should of taken it up then shouldn't we?
Anyway
I'd of kept him in a bit longer
what they're talking about is going to Blackpool aren't they?
Well no, now you see, now is, what's happened is this  tt we argued er the case after we saw the notice, but we only saw the notice about a week before it went into com into committee, so we'd only a very short time to get everything organized, well we got letters and this petition, we sent it in to the council, Stanley came round and talked to one of the young men round our place, not like that, but he was saying oh we'll do this, that and the other, but when he came round and now we know they'd lobbied all the committee that were good and they knew it was gonna be passed, they knew before they went in it was gonna be passed
Yes
it was done in a very un-run way, because the notice, the notice  was, was er it'd be up about a couple of days and then it'd come down, you see, so it didn't give anybody a lot of chance, but anyway now it's been passed you see it goes ahead and that's all there is to it, he, he hasn't start doing it yet but 
No 
it'll never be moved from there, but what an opportunity they had, they could of, they could 
Aye, yeah 
said well if the E E C say it has to be done why don't 
You'll never move it now then
What, no I don't think so, the E E C should of be, should of said well if it has to be moved if it's 
Oh yeah 
environmental an'all and the council say it's environmental you're likely 
Well I've a 
to give it a bit of something to help us to move it
well I haven't always 
but it's a mystery 
well I haven't always worked here
what the, what you the flu?
eh?
Has it been cold or?
Oh aye cold and, ooh round here
Oh

That's a meal innit?
Eight a day

of a morning and
I had eight a day I had
And no missing
Well I wanted to get
 

it ain't up to European standard isn't that
no, no, but, no, no oh no it isn't, no
No
but there wasn't said at the council, they said that they realize that what there has to be done can't be done so, so quickly, you see the past in what er back end of October
It's always been a slaughterhouse all my life that, all, all my life there's been one, young girls use them, use some of them food shops round here
Yeah
all my life there's been a slaughterhouse
Yeah

The whole council agreed it should be moved
Eh?
The whole council agreed it should be moved
they all agreed with it  er Eleanor said it should be moved
But I think it it is 
Not to be 
if, if, if they go into the Common Market rate, EE standard or summat it's bloody new job we'd have to be, gotta go to Blackpool this year
Well it's engineer that has the, has it all run now
Aye
it's up to him whether it's, whether they say it's right or wrong  I think, I think what the council said is if they, if they want it, the thing shifting, they are strong enough to get it shifted  if they, if they, if they really feel that the things rot, you see up in the Dales they, one chap built a house and er, and they said they had to pull it down because it wouldn't fit in with, of 
No 
but they, but they told him he'd have to pull it down, so
Yeah, but this job's just a bit different innit?
I think, I think
Just a little bit different
Aye 
Wind is in such a big way  and if he goes to the planning appeal and one thing or something, it'll skin this bloody, it'll, it'll skin this bloody town
of course it will, we've planned enough, oh yes, certainly, what they doing with, what, what they do with
them, them, making them camps and gypsy camps
Yeah, yeah

Yeah
an appeal goes into a hundred thousand pounds you know 
Yeah, yeah

That's right, yeah oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
you know but er, there are  you get the money and pay for 'em that'll be all the .
I thought you know, I did think when they were talking, when the council they were talking about spending a lot of money behind the station
Eh?
er, thinking of spending a lot of money behind the station and building the supermarket and ploughing it all up, that car park, and then putting the information centre in the old, old
I did think you know when I, when we go around and we look at some of these houses like Barratt houses and all like that, I thought that area would of been better off knocking into houses and then you see they would be able to get the community charge of the houses, but as it's gonna happen now  the council's gonna have a lot of responsibility one way and another with er
 
they gonna have to they gonna have to pass a lot of land to build houses on to get the bloody rev revenue back in the town
Yeah
d'ya know that?
They are that  they are that, because I tell you what it is, I don't know
They don't seem to be interested in making money, they seem to be interested in spending it to my mind  I could be wrong you know
