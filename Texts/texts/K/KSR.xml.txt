And don't talk stupid because it's for a  it's for a special project.

Oh right.
So  I'm allowed to record you.
Okay?
Yes.

That box.

Let's have a look.
Now this one, if yo , you can work out how it works, cos I can't work out  how  to get that antiperspirant to go on your body.
It's a bit stupid.
Like that.
What did you do?
Just push it up the bum.
Well I couldn't work out how to do that!
Oh oh.
What have you done now?
I pushed it right out.
Push it, when you want it, just push it  up there
Yeah.
so it comes out.
And I was trying like, I was going like that for ages.
Push it like that.
Oh don't, oh don't waste it.
Look at the state of your hands!
What's wrong with them?
Beautiful!
They're beautiful!
They are beautiful!
 
You could do nail varnish commercials with hands like that, you really could.
I really need to don't I?
Anna works on a farm and in her spare time paints her nails!
A shocking red colour.
What's this then, bubble bath?
Well read the bottle and it'll tell you?
It doesn't say.
Oh it's shower gel that one.
It fell off  when I was in the pool.
This is  shower 
Ooh!
gel.
This is shower gel.
Oh no, they're both shower gels.
That came with the last lot that I got.
And that one came with this 
It smells nice.
one.
But when  when erm  when I unwrapped it, cos it had a bottle a , that big bottle with it as well, that little bot , where's the little bottle?
Had a what bottle with it?
It had a big bottle of Georgio with it.
Oh right.
And that little bottle was still half empty, and all the tissue paper inside really smelt heavily of perfume like it had leaked already.
Oh oh.
Well maybe it had gone 
.
Oh dear.
You never know.
So you never know really.
Oh.
I was gonna get you a blow up Mr Blobby for  Christmas 
Were you?

I'd find so many uses for it.
Don't be stupid!
I would have done.
Yeah alright then.
Ha ha ha!
Will Mark want Christmas from me?
No.
A bit early to be thinking about Christmas isn't it?
No it's not , it's only about eight weeks away.
Yeah, but eight weeks is a long time.
No it's not.
Not the way my 
Yeah , I don't think yo , you don't have to go round and buy everybody's present out of that catalogue.
I'm not.
No, they're the only two things I'm getting out of there.
Is it?
Yeah.
I'm not getting anything else.
It's all kiddies stuff other than those.
Oh.
So I don't know what else to get.
Erm  I dunno, let me have a think.
Yeah, well if you know 
There's probably

Right.
give you the money for it.
Okay then.
And then you can borrow money out the bank again.

Course he won't!
Very

he'll bore them to death.
He'll actually bore them for me.
Hundred million crap jokes !
Yeah, I'll give him a try.
Can he stay there?
And once you make the joke, and I always tell jokes that make them laugh.
Where's the delivery?
See, that's a joke .
 
Oh oh.
I presume David's there next week.
Who's that?
He goes here there and everywhere.
Marvellous!
Oh well David's not like that, he's  well Mark's just had a bit of luck he's just .
That's three thousand pounds for a 
I know.
new suite to be cleaned.
Just er, I shall spend it.
Mm.
You'll do what?
No I've given up on him.
You must get, you must hear that new song it's really good.
He's not had a chance yet.
No.
David Jensen's playing  like it's going out of fashion !
Does David want ?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Oh.
No that's fine.
What?
No, no, he's, he's alright.
They got .
Is the tape running?
Yeah.
Sorry?
Doesn't go very far though does it?
Oh I hope so .
No.
I'm fed up with it.
Sorry?
What colour?
It's a mixture of colours.
Erm  it's sort of like lines, you have a bit like paint, you know that sort of  erm  it's like paint brush stripes.
You know, and there's just short little, like brush marks.
Do you know 
Mm mm.
you have wallpaper like it sometimes.
Oh well, very trendy?
It's a bit like, it's the same sort of idea as that sleeping bag you've got, you know, little short dashes of paint 
Mm.
of colour.
Oh I see.
And erm  it's
We don't have to whisper, they're not listening .
But it's a bit erm
Was it expensive?
About er,ne , nearer two thousand than, than a thousand.
Well these garish things always are.
I mean, for that I could have, do a lovely one for under, a reasonable price, and they're going straight for the cord.
Yeah.
Comes with matching pouffe and things like that.
Never mind.
Mm.
They'll never know.
Mm.
Have to be careful when you're talking about that cos
Mm mm.
cos you might say to Mark, oh have a listen to my recording
I'll tell him!
I'll tell him to his face I think his parent's sofa's not very nice.
.
Well they're not gonna hear.
?
I doubt it.
I don't lie to him especially as we've got a  obviously.
Who's this?
Peter Sissons, that's it.
 
I knew it was something along those lines.
Ooh!
Can I ask you, could you do some photocopying for me tomorrow?
Yeah.
I need these log sheets cos they didn't leave us any log sheets.
Mm.
Erm
And Sarah   sounds like a ship doesn't it?
And we're sailing on, we're sailing on the Sarah Bell.
Alright?

Yeah.
This guy, Oliver .?
He's er 
Oh yeah , he's the one we sent a list to the other day.
Yeah.
And erm, he's very, he's got a house with, er somewhere with Lords but he doesn't really wanna take  it's a little bit complicated
Where?
he's got his deposit tied up with Lords at the moment 
Mm.
and they've got all the rest of it sorted out so it's quite easy to 
I have already, I, I , obviously as you know, I've got the new towns.
move in quickly  if we can agre , agree with Lords 
Mm mm mm 
Shall I have that one?
Possibly.
See if they're there?
Yep.
Erm
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, I don't think it  she's a bit of shrewd old pigeon isn't she?
I think we're gonna have to watch her?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna phone them now anyway and see if they can at least come into you.
Okay?
Cos I mean, I've got a couple of people who wanna view it already.
You got anybody else round?
Okay.
I'll, I'll give her a bell anyway and when this geezer's coming into you.
Yeah.
The money yesterday, it's alright rub it in!
Go on!
It's my, it's my birthday Monday and I'm  just, my wife's taking me  really?

Oh thanks for telling us!
Yeah I'd rather do it Monday.
Perhaps you'd have let me know we could have gone for a beer.
So 
Yeah.
I mean, well
Well we didn't get any better 
Yes we are.
Yes.
be in over the weekend.
Alright.
Okay .
I'll speak to you soon.
Right.
Bye 
But is it a similar design to this one Catherine?
No, they're two totally different properties.
Have you, got, not got  written details?
One of , the things that 
Yeah.
that I've done.
Right.
Hello Mr ?
Hello from Alberford.
Hello to you.
Erm, any luck with those keys yet?
Were you, sure.
Right okay.
If you mind that anyway, cos I may have a couple of people er  that may want a few of them to, spoken to Dav , David , he's got one or two as well.
Hello is that Cyndy ?
Alright well yo , okay.
If that's okay with you?
That's fine.
We'll leave it like that.
Hi, it's Clare from  Prudential.
Alright.
Hello.
Erm  I've had a gentleman on the phone this morning we have on our listings, I'm quite interested for him to have a look at the 
Er, yes possible.
I mean out of the three that he saw and prefer, I must admit he did prefer forty four.
Erm 
property sometime today.
he's going away to think about it.
I mean, obviously,whe whether or not he was absolutely 
Er, I wondered if that was possible.
one hundred and ten percent serious.
Erm  yeah.
Really?
Oh that is great!
Yeah but certainly the three he saw 
I mean I know he's going to be out sometime this afternoon, so I think any time after about six o'clock 
erm, he saw two before forty four and preferred forty four for the size of the .
would be suitable for 
Right?
him.
I'll let you know as soon as I know.
Alright Mr ?
Thanks.
Bye .
Okay.
Hello.
Right.
So if we said erm  sort of seven o'clock?
Would that be okay?
Yep.
Okay.
His name is Oliver  .
Okay?
And I'll send him along at seven then?
That's lovely.
Thank you.
Bye-bye .
David,
Hello
Gary.
Hello.
Would it be possible to speak to Oliver ?
Right I've just spoken .
Erm  it's not  
It's Clare  from the Prudential.
Thank you.
Oh.
Well I know.
Just thought I'd call you.
Alright?
So  you could, yeah, you've got his telephone number anyway, so you can also phone him at the same time.
I just said, look, you know, silly really, cos I mean, he knew I had a couple of people, erm, you know, Monday and Tuesday, before Monday and Tuesday and er  you know, you got erm  you need a couple of people as well, so  if you don't mind coming over from , it's entirely up to you.
Hello.
Yeah, erm, if you could ask him to give me a call 
Yeah, fair enough.
I mean it's the best way to do it anyway, anyway, we shouldn't have.
Alright?
Cheers.
Bye .
on ?
I've managed to make him an appointment for one of the properties we were discussing earlier.
Er er
Yeah.
And my name's Clare.
Okay, thank you.
Bye- bye .
I went to see Sleepless in Seattle last night.
It was lovely!
Oh oh!
Cath wants to take me to see it?
What was it like?
Well, it depends whether you li , it's a bit of a sort of  old-fashioned weepy but it was really good.
In other words Cath wants to see me crying.
It was ,it was really sweet.
Ah?
Mm mm.
Mm.
That's that  
Good morning  Prudential can I help you?
Certainly.
Who's calling?
Yeah.
 
Right, hold on a moment please  Sarah  for you.
For me?
Yes.
Good morning, Gary  speaking, can I help you?
Oh right.
Right.
Thank you for telling us.
So, your property's still available?
Right.
Right.
Okay.
You both seem with the situation in hand .
So is Adam just off for a week or is it a fortnight?
No, just off for a week.
Oh
He wasn't gonna take any.
I said to him, you need it, you know just go.
It's, it's okay I mean  when he's away    things go, actually things go a lot smoother.
Sorry?
Things go a lot smoother when he's not here.
Mm mm.
It's a shame, what yo , I think you could really do with is somebody sort of part-time  who is kind of flexible on, on when they're part-time so they could fit in with the  with the sort of fluctuation 
 
that the, the busyness goes in.
Well I was hoping, yeah exactly.
I mean, you obviously know what I want here, but I mean  I was hoping that Yvonne would come across and work maybe two stroke three days  a week for me  even when 
Yeah.
I needed to.
But, her husband's just sta , or the boyfriend, the boyfriend's just started up a new company
Mm.
and that erm, that ain't gonna be possible unfortunately.
Oh dear.
Was erm  is it Lorraine doing some work, is she doing some work for you?
Is it Lorraine?
Julie?
I forget which, yeah, whichever one  of Graham's sister's has got all those children .
Oh  Julie, yeah.
You know, cracks in the walls.
Erm, yeah she is, but she's doing, you know these calls I've been receiving.
She's been doing the canvass one, canvass two, and canvass three.
Oh right.
Erm  I got, I mean, er er, she's, she's like part-time canvassing for me at the moment.
You know, everything I've got in my bottom drawer  she does  anyway.
Yeah.
Or all the ones that need sold, you know, got nice  photographs of all the sold boards, and what I want her to do now is go and  literally go and traipse the streets
Mm mm.
whereby we've sold a  sold a property in those roads and erm  deliver leaflets either side
Yeah.
and six doors up, six doors down from the one we've sold and get a coloured photograph so  that's the next campaign going out.
Yeah.
She works for me in that side.
Erm  erm, she's not really, not really a typist.
No.
Er er  so it's difficult.
I mean, when, when Yvonne comes in, blimey!
I mean,sh , talk about work her socks off!
Erm, she's in at ten o'clock and she just does not stop  until four o'clock.
Mm mm.
She did  she did nine  nine instructions for me  last week.
The week before that it must have been  eleven, twelve.
Have you seen the top drawer?
No.
God!
Twenty thousand pounds worth of sales in the bottom drawer now.
Oh that's brilliant!
And there's six thousand pounds worth of financial services.
That's excellent!
So  just over half way in a year.
No, I love it to bits, but I just wish there was some assistance in the office.
Yeah.
It's difficult, cos I know Adam doesn't like the idea of employing secretaries  he likes the idea to sort of to, to maximize  by having somebody that does both.
But I think there is a case for
Well it's blatantly taking the piss, let's be honest, I mean, I can't muck around, I mean it's blatantly taking the piss isn't it?
Yeah.
I mean 
You know 
I think there is a case, especially, and not so much with the letters because there is a minimal amount of, of secretarial work, but with something like that  I think you would really do with somebody who's just there basically to type  and 
Mm.
answer the phone
Mm.
Mm.
and not have to keep stopping and starting and 
That's right.
But I mean, it's getting to the stage now where it's gonna become counter-productive, well, for me cos it's got to such a point now where  I've got exchanges going through, I've got erm  sales going through, details to be typed, canvassing going out, instructions, appointments to make, the outcomes 
Yeah.
a therefore, like Catherine's in a situation herself and she'll obviously vouch for it, I cannot get my applicants.
No.
If I could get my applicant, you see if, let's say we pay somebody, I dunno  fifty, sixty quid a week, fifty quid a week to come and  for, two mornings, three mornings, or whatever  that'll then give me enough time to contact the applicants and then ma , maybe  maybe two stroke three sales extra  per month.
Mm.
Half a sale would pay
Yeah.
the annual salary for this so-called 
Yeah.
part-timer.
But I've got to the stage now where  I, I cannot erm  I cannot do any more.
No.
I was even, you know, obviously you can worry about sending the stuff, this canvass three out  purely because the  the amount of instructions I had to do last week.
Mm mm.
I'm, I'm glad they're coming on, we seem to be taking on more than  hopefully the old, the old wages at the moment, which is encouraging.
It's the erm  .
Right.
Now it's actually at the midla down in Yule, which is the far side of erm  Tulworth.
Yep.
Mhm.
Is that gonna be suitable for you really?
Okay then.
Well not to worry, I'll cancel that one.
Erm  I'm afraid that property's now gone.
Yeah.
Tt.
I don't have anything else that I could show you at the moment I'm afraid.
That's about it.
Mhm.
What's your upper price limit?
Eight hundred.
Eight fifty.
Mhm.
Okay then.
Well if anything comes up I'll call you.
Yup.
Yeah.
I would be very surprised if a property on at nine fifty would be dropped much below nine hundred  because, obviously they have a, they have a certain that they need to get and  I I'd be surprised if they'd go sort of much below fifty pounds less a month than they've advertised it for.
And if anybody wants a drink or anything er er, there's Coke behind, if anybody wants a coffee or  you know, just shout.
Mm.
I'll get the slave outside to do that one.
I can say that now 
 
cos she can't hear.
Lucky.
What's this then?
Right.
Are we gonna make a move then?
I mean 
Erm , yeah.
I'm frightened to 
Yeah.
without, without 
The tape is on.
It's going.
It's on?
Yes, yes.
Oh so we've already been had.
What yes.
That is one month's
Alright.
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
But before the 
 
meeting can I just 
 
I'd like to give something to Chris actually.
Oh dear!
And I have an apology to make.
This is the reason for this is it?
 
That is right !
 
Nearly a year too late.
I found them in my room.
I must say that.
Ah ah ah, that's it.
And if you have with Carole 
So it was you all the time.
it's surprising he's found them this 
He will but
it could have been three years time before that surfaced.
You're a right plonker Mark!
Agree with that.
Alright.
Thank you.
Yes, you go in by  
Yeah .
You can say to the secretary.
Right.
Better make a start then.
Apologies for absence for Sir  who is in Fiji.
Erm
urgh urgh urgh!
But not yet 
 
he's not.
Wurgh urgh urgh!
Well he's on his way to Fiji via Melbourne 
He's nearly there.
and er, Auckland is he?
Au ,
Why?
Oh that's when I was there.
Er, it's the only way you can get there apparently.
So you fly to the 
This, this
No, but why's he going?
Erm
To visit his brother.
because his brother who likes listening to erm, erm air traf , sounds 
Oh part of the air waves , yes.
erm finds that the Fiji air controls are the most fascinating in the world.
And his brother's out there at the moment listening to the erm  you know, the aircraft co 
Oh that's very nice.
No he's on a round the world ticket, it's cost him eleven pound.
And fly into New Zealand I would have thought on the
Yeah.
Was that the bloke who played soft ball with us last year?
Er er 
Yes it was.
yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
He came to watch Wimbledon Y S A once  
How much is that costing him, a round the world ticket?
Well it's only costing Eddie's brother a hundred erm  one thousand one hundred pounds.
Only!
But it's costing Eddie about nine hundred pound, and the only way he can get there is this kind of ticket which goes with, like I say Hong Kong 
We , we'll  
erm
Very nice too!
How long for?
How long is that?
He's only , he's only going for a couple of weeks
Mm.
and then he's back, he's back.
Erm 
Oh well.
No he's going for over two weeks.
Yeah?
He'll be knackered by the time he, when he gets back.
I thought he was going for three weeks.
Oh.
Oh he might be away for thre , cos I know he had golf at the Belfry this week, and then when he comes back he's being picked up by a car to take him to the Belfry again, cos we're entertaining there for a weekend's golf.
But you can't, you can't play golf.
Yeah.
Tough life!
It is.
It is innit?
Eh?
I dunno whether, how he's gonna get on.
At the back
Yeah.
whole
hardly
Yeah.
still usable though.
Yeah.
Better have, have two  
We are gonna get new ones?
Well, I dunno, can't afford it.
You can fill that in can't ya?
Yeah.
Let's face it, don't want get to the table anyway.
The head was in the way anyway.
I think he'll select his course 
But he won't 
It probably, probably cracking now.
So, make a start then.
Right.
First to obviously confirm that the A G M is for the er  eleventh of er November.
You've paid the money haven't you Mark?
Yes.
Yes I have.
Cos every time you pay the money.
Yeah.
Right.
Erm  so it'll be upstairs in the Green 
 
Green Man is 
The deposit for the Green Man  I paid it.
A very 
Right.
nice young lady behind the bar.
Erm 
Sorry Claire.
Erm, first thing I ne 
 
Oh, oh yeah !
fir , first thing I need to know is I have 
Cor !
I've not booked up erm Cricket next, yet  erm because I wanted to come to the meeting and ask erm  you know what night, and also what period?
I mean, last year we went back to Wednesday nights and we booked up erm  I think it was five er weeks  er th , the five Wednesdays of March.
Did we have two nets on?
We had two nets
Yeah.
er, we had five weeks.
Yeah.
Erm  as Eddie's sent this thing here, this minus seventy pound nett, that is the nett difference that is the cost  erm  of what it cost us to actually hire the nets less the one pound fifty er  per person, er per session that was paid, so that is the nett  difference because we come there.
So it's a case of asking what nights.
The reason say that is that I mean, Wednesday  erm nights is, if you like, football nights.
I know it wasn't too bad last year  erm  I think it's either at a Wednesday or Thursday.
I know Steve  asked if we could go back to Thursdays cos he can't make a Wednesday night.
And er, and that's the main thing isn't it ?
That's right, you 
Yeah.
know.
Well it's, it's not that I mean I'm just trying to see 
I see, you know.
Well
Cos I was thinking 
What?
I'm thinking of you guys like with your Palace, I mean, you're gonna have some Wednesday nights coming up for promotion.
Mm mm.
Erm 
No, we'd have 
and jus 
already got it by then.
Well, then you'd probably wanna go and see if they can
you know
No, actually Palace, to be fair Palace very rarely play on a Wednesday.
They usually play 
Don't they?
on a Tuesday.
Yeah.
For the time being.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tomorrow night, I know.
Yeah, I'm working this week.
Oh.
Yeah.
Anyway, so that's the first thing, what erm  you know, which, what do you wanna keep it Wednesdays and do the same as 
Yeah.
last year or do you wanna go to Thursdays or
Keep it to Wednesday.
I think Thursdays is fine.
Get Steve 
Can't be Wednesdays  
Are they 
Well
Get Steve  down there and
Does it matter?
Do you wanna fight about it?
Jus th , the  it didn't seem to alter too much the, the people 
No.
who attended last year.
Apart from Steve , I don't think there appeared to be anyone who turned round and said look they couldn't do it.
So therefore, if we go back to Thursdays Steve 
Mm.
can come down.
And to be fair to Steve, he was absolutely crap cricketer
and er is now 
Still is.
now got  a bit better.
His batting
For not getting it in the nets.
Cos he didn't go to  that's why!
Well I think old Steve, he thoroughly enjoys himself
Oh yeah.
er , and he, he's
He's on an abseiling weekend  though.
absolutely useless in the field and we want  to, oh well 
Mm.
bring him out of 
Well that's why I delayed it cos I mean he is actually keen to come, and he was very disappointed last year but obviously he pu 
Mm mm.
puts the band before us, but er  so I'll go to Thursdays then on, on er
I would think so, yeah.
and keep five, five erm, well, you know the Thursdays of March and two nets?
Yep.
Okay.
We could even le 
We certainly need more than one  net.
Yeah, I don't know  how well they'd get offended if we 
Yeah it was alright.
There were quite, there were quite of times 
I like nets, I think nets is excellent.
I think 
Yeah.
we could have more, the more nets the better.
It's, it's no extra 
We could go about having a quarter of an hour batting 
Carrying it out  
if you can have a quarter of an hour's batting each
We can bowl from the side.
We need them high up.
Mm.
But we, there were too many people for two nets last year to have 
Yeah.
quarter of an hour.
Well yes.
Sometimes we were struggling to get ten minutes each.
Though the nets were well attended.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos even John and George was  sort of coming from end to another.
Well yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Tony came round to bat for us didn't he?
And Andrew  'll come this year.
Yeah, I mean, obviously erm  , I think we originally moved back from Thursdays to Wednesdays because on Thursdays I think erm
EastEnders.
there was a lot of people who couldn't make it.
I think Steve  was going to a  first aider or something, and there was quite a few different people.
On that subject, obviously next year, er bearing in mind that we've agreed as a committee to go for twelve matches on Sundays
Aha.
erm, we gotta bear in mind that a lot of these er  younger players are now gonna be away at erm  college, university whatever.
Erm  and that 
Yeah , that's true up to a point, but you've gotta remember though that that  only affects the first half, or first bit of season.
Cos they're all still here until the end of the season  cos they don't go back  .
Yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
But obviously with twelve matches I'm not gonna be able to  spread it like I did  last year.
Well no , you've got more at the end  as opposed to the 
Yeah.
beginning.
But then er 
But then they're back for it.
but then it clashes with 
Yes they are aren't they?
that clashes with the erm  with the football which we're trying to avoid.
Well, we 
erm 
could can't we?
There's not too much on the football front 
I don't think it does really.
on Sundays in Septembers.
No.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have to spread them out anyway and erm  it could be a problem.
I don't think there's many of them that go to football anyway is there?
Well it's not 
I mean 
it's not necessarily going 
It's not  is it?
And it's not so much 
And i if you got 
people it's actually using the pitches.
some of the taking exams as we had this year, they, they 
Oh, I see what you mean.
the fact 
Well that's 
they couldn't play.
Yeah.
That's right.
It was half of 
That was in.
the season because apparently 
Exams.
they do it more and more this year.
Yeah.
And we're gonna have, obviously have to avoid the two Sundays from the tour.
Mm.
And it does, with twelve you are  and obviously I'm depending upon  another team to 
Are we 
come play us this year.
decided who we're gonna play with the twelve fixtures against you?
Mm.
Erm  well
gonna play them all against  Sutton Partisans.
That's right, yeah !
 
Erm 
They out-rank us.
 
Yeah, I I do 
Well I see nothing wrong with that at all.
I got a rough idea of who erm  we're kind of er  playing  contact.
Course.
Cos the  the bloke from the B B C doesn't want to play us now cos we're too good, I mean
Well I mean, I don't 
Really?
Is that right?
want a ga 
Is that right?
Yeah.
Mm.
I was gonna go
This was the same youngsters that were playing two years ago.
So you're gonna go one with them?
Yeah.
I was only gonna 
 
go one with them anyway.
If erm
I think you might be able to swing one.
Mm.
Yeah, I mean I was gonna go, one Sutton Partisans, one for the 
 
B B C
Oh I think Sutton Partisans we could go two.
Yeah, but a cracking place to go and play for 
Yeah.
Yeah.
only one.
that, that that
We're looking four.
This is the thing.
Yeah.
But they're a really nice bunch 
 
of blokes.
I know but
Yeah.
really it
er we erm 
and they'll probably get two pitches  or something .
Pay your money for it .
Mm.
Yeah.
The er Wi Witham second eleven I'm still gonna, gonna keep that one in.
Erm  got a fixture  just off the press 
Cos we played them twice Witham didn't we?
Yeah, not if  not if we're going to that pub.
No.
They 
 
th , that could be decided, but Walton Heath Sports.
What is wrong with the Robin Hood?
Walton Heath Sports?
Yeah, we played them once before.
Who's that then?
I dunno.
Erm, in fact that's where Andy got his top score 
You've not been there before.
against, Andy's top score's against Walton Heath Sports.
But that's erm, that's be an away match, that's at Walton Heath near where the golf course is there.
That's the guy who I work with.
Erm, that is very much medium  er er  week, and probably more medium that medium week.
Erm  obviously keep the score figure,fig , figure if we can.
That's alright, bring them on.
Bring them up.
I ke , I was keeping the two with Strenewe cos that's a nice venue 
Yeah.
and erm
That we , about the best.
Well yeah, about the best 
I like playing Strenewe.
games we play actually on a Sunday.
Yeah.
We want erm  Tony wanted to play us, the Sunday side twice  erm
The Shamrocks.
Yeah.
Great.
which is again, er I dun , one of the guys at work, another guy at work come  which is quite a, well it's near Guildford, Primchet, which is quite a good  quite a good 
 
side.
But he knows actually what we're trying to do on a Sunday, and they either like to play us, er er once or twice  and they got a reasonable ground.
And I was trying to, gonna move the  was gonna discuss with you first, but Croydon  see, so they're actually not Croydon Rank, they're Croydon, but anyway 
Mm mm.
you know what I mean, erm  to play them on a Sunday  which 
Mm mm.
I know, I'm saying we're trying to improve the strength but we still have 
Mm.
the Partisans who may be a little bit weaker, and certainly Croydon Rank is on a Sunday  erm rather than Saturday.
Cos 
Maybe they want to come here.
the Saturday
Yeah, we want somebody, you gotta remember, it's the only side that is  ever so slightly  weaker  than the Saturday side.
Yeah, I mean 
Er 
it was a waste of time on a Saturday really, I mean, I think the, I mean Andy said we could have 
That was alright.
we could have had it all over by three o'clock.
Well we're  that's
 
They're further.
but it's all, it was all down to the captain 
It was on the other side.
though really, I thought, that day.
Definitely.
Mm.
Definitely.
The captain was superb that day.
Go cra , er the er
What the captain?
No.
The ca 
the captain on the day  was batting and batting and batting himself until he got to seventy
Yeah I know !
and then he declared.
Tell me all about it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Like the balls 
It was raining at the time.
so erm
Did we win though?
Cos I mean our, did we win?
Say no,ju , if th if this is 
 
right this will improve the er  improve the strength.
Now see I'm looking at this here, right, just for fitting in twelve games  I mean, I'm gonna have to start the first of May.
Erm  so that'll include September the fourth which is my last Sunday one, September the fourth.
Er, because also yo you really don't wanna play like three consecutive Sundays, but  on some of you these yo we may even have to.
It is difficult.
Hang on, the play I was gonna 
May I, can I ask you a question Brian?
Yeah.
Why do you write on such small pieces of paper?
Er, this is not 
I mean, just wondered really.
I haven't got the things yet, I mean I have to 
First of May , if we get rid of the youngsters, first of May might be a bit of problem cos there's 
Mm.
probably a cup final and they're still playing  football  on the first of May.
Mm mm.
It's the week after that that they really start playing.
Yeah I know, I've got that pencilled in for something.
I mean that, that early fixture we struggle on a Saturday sometimes don't we?
Down at erm
Yes.
Yeah.
erm where are they?
Kinsbury.
Kingsbury.
Is that the erm, bank holiday?
It will be.
It will be.
Er 
It will be weren't it?
It's always the first Monday of the er 
Yeah.
I've got a feeling that bank holiday won't, probably not the world's greatest 
Mm mm.
time to start.
I don't see any reason this year why you shouldn't go  get another fixture on th , the Sunday in September.
Yeah, mid-September.
Yeah.
Either the eleventh or the eight, eighteenth.
After the fourth, you've got the eleventh.
On the eleventh.
And if , only if we're guided by football, they're playing in the morning, they'll finish, they'll, they don't play in the, in the 
Yeah.
afternoon.
Okay.
Well we'll, I'll put that in.
And ah
See I haven't got the games around there.
I think Andy's , what time, when do your lot play?
I think they start on the eighteenth 
dunnit?
Yeah.
usually.
Er, if you did the eleventh, the fourth or the eleventh
Yeah, it might be.
should be alright.
Mm.
And take away the one at the beginning of May 
 
I would have thought.
Yeah.
What time is it?
Oh well, I just say, I mean a lot depends on when other teams can play us.
 
Cos I wanna get
Yeah.
we wanna get decent away matches and not to er  have to have too many  home games.
Er right, okay.
I might let out tonight actually.
Yeah.
That's right.
Anyway, the poi , the other thing is erm  then obviously this re , concerns really  you know, you two at the moment, but, players for next year, I mean  bearing in mind we are gonna lose a few.
Erm 
 
George for example, erm
Mm.
certainly is going.
Mhm mm.
Erm, and what I said about the erm 
We had a player who   Ha?
what I said about the er
George didn't play a lot really.
He didn't play an awful lot this year, no.
No he didn't.
Erm, but on the other hand we had early season, you know, from Stuart and he seemed to interest in away but I don't know why he didn't play much at the end of the season.
Oh he was er, playing fa football  for Eagle Star.
Fa football?
And five-a- side stuff.
Mm mm.
Well erm
And he got the hots for a girl as well which didn't help.
Oh well.
Ah well, yeah, okay.
Well what I was thinking is, I mean 
That'll  
I don't know if you Wallington Cottages are gonna 
That's what we're talking about now I think .
 
if Wallington Cottages are gonna break up.
But if they're not gonna break up, I mean, there are some pretty disillusioned players there.
I think they 
Erm 
will stay together.
Cos I was talking to Brian
Yeah.
We'll grab them!
cos I think he's gonna be Captain next year.
Is he?
Yeah.
Oh, well I se 
We'll miss their pitch  for sure.
He's erm, he's after the 
It's a damn nice pitch that!
he's after, he's been after trying to Captain the side 
Oh.
next year.
Shocker!
Oh that's shame cos I  what about, I mean I was thinking of erm, John sa , John , you know Andrew's brother?
Cos he's a really  you know nice guy and
Yes, as long as you keep the ball.
He's  in the side.
Yeah I was gonna say
 
No I think you ought to take him because then I don't have to place  a man .
He can't
er I mean  he can't 
What is it?
do anything else other than keep wicket.
Mm.
Yeah.
And talk the hind legs off a donkey.
Er well no we've got a ni , there's no need Brian.
Eh?
He talks the hind legs off a donkey.
Yeah.
But he's boring 
But he's go , he's 
as well dead boring.
but he's a good 
Well yeah.
Like Marcus is in  
He, he's, he's a, he's, he's 
Yeah.
He's a
No, no, no.
He's worse than Marcus.
Marcus is, you can have a bit of a laugh with Marcus, but I mean er
John is a bit more serious isn't he?
John's serious, you can't he is dead serious all the time and it is a 
 
sometimes a great effort  to get away from him !
I thought he might be good also from the erm, you know, trying to get a decent pitch and things like that.
You know, I mean I know  he said that the best thing, decision we ever made was not to go to erm  Raynes Park because the wicket really has deteriorated on that, but he has a lot of contacts and things.
And I didn't think he was that happy with Cottages, and in fact, I thought he was gonna leave anyway.
He has left, really.
He has left 
Yeah.
now yeah.
After that game.
He is left.
Yeah.
Cos he came round the next week  and talked to me, he had a quick chat with me for about three hours!
I mean, apart from keep wicket, I mean does he bat?
I mean er
No.
In fact he doesn't does he?
I got him out first ball.
I, I just thought 
Well er 
I'd add that in.
depends on how they're playing I guess.
Be , I used to bloody give them not-out by the umpire.
Oh!
Was that you?
Yeah.
But he walked.
But he walked.
And he said hello to you.
That's what I mean, he's a nice gu 
 
I mean there's that many .
No, no there's no room.
I mean, do we want these kind of people in our team?
Well I du , I mean I dunno but I just
I mean Brian I know yo , you know you  but, I just feel that we might 
Next question please?
struggle next year.
I know I say this every year but I, I, I just thought we might 
You just wanna be a pessimist Brian, you know.
Yes well 
well I do feel we might struggle for players.
But bearing in mind we're playing 
I mean it might 
more matches.
yeah, it might affect us if we're gonna play that mu more matches on a Sunday as well because I don't know how many people will be  prepared to turn out on both days.
That's true.
If we need some of the youngsters for Saturday, then are 
Mm mm.
they gonna wanna turn out Sunday you know, or vice versa?
Well the youngsters are much more
flexible and much more willing to turn out both days than older folk.
I'm not saying they're not willing, but they've got other drags on them.
If they're at school and they're studying for exams they may not be a la , you know, possible for them to play both days.
That's a fair comment.
I mean Nick  
We'll send the boys round and nobble them.
Saturdays innit?
Mm mm.
Mm.
But erm  I dunno.
Let's go for a recruitment drive.
I mean who have lost at the 
Yeah.
moment?
Talking about George 
Yeah , how many
is there anybody else?
How many did I say we were actually talking about Brian?
How many, well, I mean, and i if you like, I mean we've lot, I mean we've lost, I mean he didn't play at all last year, but as Chris said 
Mm.
one of the reasons which we lacked last year was er, was a, was a fast, you know, opening bowler.
We lost on er, what's his name?
Mm.
John .
Oh yeah.
Erm 
Well 
Well he didn't do very much.
we hired him so many times 
Yeah.
Yeah.
He didn't really play a match when we played 
Yeah.
it.
Erm  I doubt, you know he'll come 
 
It's Steve what's his name as well, he never played.
Well he must have once.
Steve ?
.
Yeah I mean he's, he's given up 
He's given up now.
he's given up er
He works anyway I think 
Mm.
so I mean 
Mm.
He's basically kind of given up erm cricket.
I dunno what the situation with Andrew  is, cos I mean I heard the rumours that he was gonna for Cheam.
.
.
 
Oh!
plays for Spurs.
.
Spurs, yeah.
Erm
,
Was he  erm
Whatever his name is!
Whatever his name is.
He plays football .
I mean the rumours were that he was gonna go to Cheam, he was supposed to be Saturdays for Cheam.
And how he can afford match fees or anything, cos he's never paid us a penny, I dunno, but
No don't want 
Er 
him back .
Yes I mean, isn't he still at school?
 
He's gonna play snooker in a minute.
He is still at school.
No he's at college, no he's at college 
Oh no he's at college that's right.
He's, he's at Epsom Art College.
That's right, he is at 
Oh right.
art college.
Yes he is.
So I mean I don't know if they 
He's at art college  football .
I dunno if they've got a cricket team or whatever.
Blimey!
So I'm saying that, you know, it's gotta be a doubt.
Er Dominic who, you know  again  is the ideal person 
But it's not convenient.
if he was a , always available but  see you got a lot of, you got a players like Dominic 
 
Stuart, Andrew who  is everyone was available we wouldn't have a problem, but 
No.
at the end of their they're only gonna 
It's always right innit?
if they play half the matches.
I mean, Dominic played eleven.
Well, Dominic would have played more but he couldn't get in the blooming team!
Which was surprising.
Cos some games, he ge , he did get dropped.
Well
I don't think he was available was he?
Brian 
No.
says.
Cos he's not available regularly 
He was not available.
is he?
No, I can only think, I think there was one game where he was available, but, he was a sort of a  late availability and by that time we already had 
Oh yeah.
eleven people.
Mm.
But there was only, there was  two or three times in all the time.
Well I got it from when he had the 
Yeah, he, he, he 
Ca , Cameron's, Cameron's gone to  to, to University now.
Aha.
Erm Mike, Mike  didn't play a lot.
Well he did, Michael's left the game.
He didn't play.
And he's, you know
Erm, anyway, I mean that's a 
Where's Paul ?
it's just a
Paul will be
Paul .
Yeah, yeah I mean there's another 
 
great cricketer who only played a couple of times last season, was Dave .
 
 
Okay.
Fair enough.
But you've not , you've not had people yet, why can't you er 
Dave ?
you could encourage, what's his name?
Neil .
Neil, and Gary.
And Jason.
Do they play cricket do they?
There was Jason, are you gonna try and 
Jason?
encourage these guys?
?
Jason .
And Jason , we've gotta try and encourage him.
I, I mean he got  bags of possibility there.
I could get the whole of  to play with us.
After playing at Colman's Hatch I think.
Now,.
Yeah, see I mean 
Oh yeah.
I think Jas 
Yeah.
Jason's always been a winner and 
Er , er er
Yeah.
I don't think he'd, he'd
And you saying my team of losers Brian?
It's not that.
I ain't playing after that at all.
Nah , but he, he do , what I mean is some people  enjoy 
Yeah.
it even when we're 
That's right.
yeah, but I always get the impression with Jason that he wouldn't enjoy anything unless he 
No.
He won it.
unless he won it.
That's right.
No.
Well, that's only my opinion but
No I agree with you.
er erm 
Well he had a good start didn't he?
Yeah !
And er  Colman's Hatch is 
Did indeed, yeah.
slightly different.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyway, just things to bear in mind, right, is that we're having more fixtures next year against a higher standard of opposition, overall  erm 
Really?
and er, and we've probably got less players.
Er, I just 
No , er, it's a fair comment.
Perhaps we should advertise again in the paper.
That's, d'ya remember we got Andy  last time we did.
Yeah.
Fat bowlers, d'ya remember that?
An inspired piece of  
Remember 
that was.
You can actually spell game.
 
I put on there what he's,do , what he done  his er bowling.
Yeah he,bo ,bowl over for twenty seven last 
Yeah.
time I think.
Twenty eight.
Yeah.
First ever game.
First ever game.
Yeah.
Some of the things 
What in the game?
to come I thought.
Yeah.
The , then he bo bowled 
Well that's right.
against
Yeah.
What was that over he 
Actually he 
bowled against?
B B C.
B B C?
God!
Strewth!
But he hadn't bowled them though 
He did bowl quite few actually there.
Talk about under , underground 
Yeah.
bowling.
Yeah !
pathetic!
It was an all-rounder that first year wasn't he?
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Terrible!
God, we had a bad team!
Mm mm.
Shocking!
Hello!
Oh don't worry about that.
Right anyway ,th er next, next thing 
That's Andy.
in my notes is that, as I said, the A G M is on the eleventh of er, of November.
Now one of the criticisms that I've had er from the people who prefer to be nameless but always come to me afterwards and say oh it was a waste of time coming.
The committee meetings are the la , er,, committee meetings!
The A G M, the last two years people have said well there's not a great deal of point in coming along other than for a drink because  er the committee's got it all sorted out, you know, beforehand as regards who's doing what.
Quite right too.
Erm  and er, they say, you know, therefore they don't feel that they've got a voice.
Erm  cos 
They can disagree if they like.
Well er
If this is the case, how come they go on so blooming long!
Yeah!
Eh?
I find that extremely difficult
I soon find that 
Goodness me!
hard to believe .
Yeah.
Everybody, everybody, has their say
Yeah.
and then we do what we want.
Well, to be fair, the A G M's I've been to, they do influence some of
Yeah.
decisions
They have
not all of them 
Yeah.
Yeah.
but they
Mm.
er they do influence some of them.
So I'd like to think that er whoever said that is er  I think they're wrong.
No it wasn't mine it was, it was er  dunno how to say 
So what really are they asking?
Admitting it.
Admitting it!
Now come on, look  
Admitting it!
mention no name names!
Well admittedly the fierce, the most fierce cricketer of all 
Paul 
who er 
Who's that?
who didn't 
Oops!
speak to me for er, for a day afterwards, at least one day, and just said 
Nobody.
oh it was a complete waste 
 
of time, er was Alan .
Oh.
And what a great night that was!
 
Just have to get over it.
But he said the whole thing 
That's right.
was a complete, you know
Yeah but why though?
Well I think that 
That's right.
probably er 
But why?
Yeah.
it su it summarizes the particular, by the bloke.
That's right.
Aha.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who else?
Come on!
Still we know he's know your mate Brian so we won't say anything nasty 
 
about him.
No I haven't said anything nasty.
No it doesn't matter
So what do they
I don't, I don't work with him any more.
you know
Erm
 
I don't know who they are.
But I ju , I
So what is it, what is it 
I'd just like to know.
what is it they actually want then?
Well I think they would like to feel that, you know, when we say right  erm
So they want, nominations for category ,
we all, eh,no no nominate Captain, Secretary whatever, that 
Yeah.
erm
Like on those  
they'd like, like them to come from the floor and not from another  from a committee member says, yeah I sponsor Billy , and another committee member says I  
Yeah, but the thing is, yeah okay, yeah 
 
but  yeah, but the thing is you're gonna get someone saying  Mickey, Mickey Mouse or whoever it is,so , you know someone who doesn't wanna stand  someone who hasn't been asked.
And we've got this 
I don't see a 
embarrassment
I mean
of having a vote and so and so gets no 
first of all we decided to do this 
and they think well blimey 
Well put them in the the black box.
nobody likes me, no votes for Captain.
There's nothing to stop them.
Our Jeff goes around and says any more nominations
Yeah.
there's nothing to stop them putting 
No, you still have 
No course there isn't 
anybody in there.
to do that anyway don't you?
Yeah.
Course there is.
Yeah.
But I 
You know 
think th ,yo , I mean they said, they they feel that it's no point anyway, it's already been decided.
Well, I think they're wrong really.
To a degree they're probably right.
Well I think they are, yeah.
To a degree I mean, I think they're right.
I think they're wrong.
But and th , and the committee has to guide  th , otherwise you'd still be there!
If, if there was no guidance coming through from the committee.
Well they vote the committee to er help vote run, to run and make the decisions of the club don't they?
And if they don't want the committee making 
No it's not just that.
the decisions of the club do they get another committee?
Well they can cha change it.
What are the club rules?
Well that's what they're saying , they're not, that the committee they say, is basically is voting ourselves back in.
And
What?
I mean, we obviously we
No.
No.
obviously we've got to have someone like  in, in erm, with regards administration, we've gotta have someone like, for example 
Ooh ooh!
I'm se , I'll be secretary if no one else wants to do it.
I'm just wondering whether we should say, you know
Mm.
nominations for  secretary or whatever, and see if other people are willing to do it.
Yeah well the committee members doesn't carry 
I thought that's what we did.
any more vote than anybody else.
No, they're not, they're not.
No.
Mm.
It's got one vote, the same as anybody else on the floor.
That's right.
Yeah.
What's our er 
 
Yeah.
club rules say about all this?
I haven't got a copy of club rules.
Nor have I.
Oh!
You know I have.
 
Yeah, no it's 
Why, why didn't you tell me this?
Yeah, Jeff.
I've, I'll have a look anyway.
Oh is this the flaky's gonna produce it is he?
Mr married man's getting Mr flaky now.
If it's the club rules
Don't do it.
you know 
Cos he stands up in public.
Er, er, ah , he's got a ca , copy of the club rules.
You should have handed them out.
That's why I was late.
The policy Dave 
I just wondered what it said.
I haven't got a clue even when it's here .
Is it about  A G M's and  things does it?
What does it say?
The off , all officers of the club should be elected at the A G M, which would be held on a .
Yeah.
What does it say about erm  pe , erm, mm mm mm mm mm mm mm, er er
It's one man, one vote.
Or one person, one
The persons  at A G M should  members of the committee at the A G M.
This is a question of 
Officers, yeah?
All officers of the club should be elected at the A G M.
Should be held no later than thirtieth of November each year .
When's the er, sorry, when's the A G M this ye , year Dave?
