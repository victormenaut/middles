Okay.
The rich peasant economy in paving the way for new China's industrialization  the economic impact of land reform.
Land reform had always been considered by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to be a means to an end, indeed it could provide a way forward for China on economic, social, communist and ideological grounds.
It was therefore very useful a tool for the Party to adopt during this period of experimentation of how to achieve successful  reconstruction of the countryside.
It is also important to realize that the C C P had a range of objectives  for power up until nineteen forty nine.
These can be summarized as the desire to achieve mass mobilization and the disruption of feudalism through land reform which the Party believed would ensure their political stability in power as well as contributing to the eventual realization of socialism.
Although their short-term aims of land reform varied throughout, the Party had always strived to destroy feudalism.
This is illustrated by  examination of all their land documents.
After the first of October nineteen forty nine, however, their political power was more or less secure due to.
By this time the C C P had almost completed the destruction of feudalism in the countryside in the north of China.
The Party now needed to come up with a longer term programme of how to pave the way towards socialism in China as a whole, paying particular attention to the different economic situation in the south which could indeed significantly influence their future strategy.
One of the most valuable lessons the Party had learnt during the initial twenty years of land reform was that socialism could only be achieved through stages.
Land reform as outlined in the Agrarian Reform Bill of nineteen fifty was to provide a vital step forward for China through the preservation of the rich peasant economy in order to pave the way for industrialization which was seen as a prerequisite for collectivization.
Absolute egalitarianism of nineteen forty six to forty eight had failed due to the limited amount of land available for redistribution.
The Party now realized that a more moderate policy of land reform was the most appropriate one for China  thus there was a temporary change in emphasis away from land reform to a desire to increase production.
To some, however, it merely appeared that the C C P were pragmatists and that by nineteen fifty were sacrificing ideological objectives for economic and political expediency.
Though a case for this could be argued, it's important to realize that the longer term goal of socialism had not changed it was only that 
 
the rules to achieving it which had.
It is necessary to take into account all these factors when evaluating the economic impact of land reform so that one can beg begin to understand why China did not achieve a more spectacular economic recovery during communist rule  the significance of the preservation of the rich peasant economy, and also why the Party decided to focus its new policy on industrialization.
What then were then economic affects on land reform on the preservation of the rich peasant economy ?
Can I just stop you there, just for a second?
Can we   you, you've said some quite important things i in this , can we just sort of clarify this before going on.
Can I just clarify, what, what you're saying is that in a sense  there is this overall aim of getting through to socialism  but the means of getting there have now changed so that we've gone from absolute egalitarianism, which is, is an immediate step tow towards socialism  you've gone away from that and the position is now to create a rich peasant economy in order to industrialize, in order to get through to collectivization, I E into socialism.
S s so socialism is a  is a long way off.
Right.
Is  is, is that how it struck you?
Tha that's my  
Yeah.
So that rich 
 
peasant economy is only a short,i it's a means to an end essentially.
Was that ever made  explicit?
Did they ever sort of erm  you know say this is just a temporary step for us?
Erm  no  I, I don't think, I think it's more implicit.
Erm  I'm, I'm not away of any documents.
What, what do you mean?
What are you going to ?
Well I, I just thought perhaps erm, you know, if there was any erm sort of up-front   to this idea of you know going through some sort of dialectical  model  career towards socialism.
Ho how would you expect to see that expressed?
Well I don't know  somebody say Mao  leading to such and a such a phase or  
 
here's what we intend to do in order to  
There's a usually a reason for their policy isn't there?
Usually, like Mao usually gives some reason.
They were constrained by s I mean like what they wanted to do  was constrained by the practical sort of necessities of the time and even if they had wanted to have a more vigorous policy of land reform
Mm.
it wasn't possible because there was a shortage of land and that how that absolute egalitarianism had shown that how that it couldn't work  if they wanted to raise everybody's level towards a middle peasant status.
They, they did have the option that they could have had complete absolute egalitarianism and made everybody into a poor peasant, but the commun but the commun the Communist Party were progressive and they s saw that how that you needed to have industrialization in order to increase the welfare of peasants which was their ultimate aim, and  I mean it appears that how that they didn't actually care er what kinds of means they'd have to achieve that, as in capitalism was justified  in this longer term perspective.
So do you, do you think erm this, this sort of movement towards the er cities and urban centres, this sort of gravity  focus, do you think that indicated any sort of  error sort of thing in, in land reforms ?
Well it's not, they're not saying it's solved they're saying it has to be delayed until it's actually possible.
Ultimately they're still keeping land reform as a long term objective cos that's 
when you, you say land reform, do you mean land reform or do you mean  socialism collectives  ?
Erm
I mean them both, they wanted  they thought that the only way you could get effective sociali socialism was through industrialization
Right.
and that how that once you've got socialism you would want to have erm absolute egalitarianism er to eliminate erm class distinction so it's probably a combination of the two.
Right.
W w w w we now have that reform, I mean thi this is  I mean what w 
Well you have land reform in the north but not in the south.
Right.
But we,w we  as of nineteen forty nine or early nineteen fifty, it's clear that we are, there, there, there's nothing to stop us now going ahead with land reforms, there is no question it's going to happen
Right.
but what they're saying,i i it's not going to be egalitarian land reform
Mm.
so there's, there's no question that feudalism is, is going to end, that, that's, that's no problem at all and we have land reform.
But it's non-egalitarian land reform.
So  you've, is there then a choice between  going for socialism now, going straight into collectivization  or delaying it and keeping that end product in sight?
But as you say changing the means to the end, I E you go for the industrialization first and once you've got that you can then move forward to collectivization.
Well I didn't think they could've gone straight into socialization because they didn't have the resources to.
Right.
They had to improve the productivity 
 
they, they had to improve the productivity from the land  and im well not productivity, just efficiency generally, and that how that it wouldn't have made economic sense for them to have gone straight for socialism.
Right.
Yes.
Would it have made  social or political sense to have done it?
It wouldn't have made political sense in that how the, they were deliberately choosing cautious policy which would enable them to stay in power.
Right.
So you'd support this policy, er th th th the strategy is right that, that, that you, you allow land reform to settle down, you allow the rich peasant economy to develop and out of that rich peasant economy will come the resources for industrialization and then you'll be able to collectivize?
Didn't it have this sort of political pattern to it 
when you said they could've done it 
Well whatever they wanted to, whatever it was then  
 
they perhaps could've gone towards more  
 
You mean they could've, they could've gone for the Soviet style collectivization?
I don't know.
Erm I'm, I'm not sure.
Mm.
I'm just saying that they could've gone  
Yeah.
perhaps more egalitarian.
Yes.
Er er certainly in retrospect one, one might argue that  erm   politically there was nothing to stop them
Mm.
certainly going much further than they did, don't quite know how far you would go 
Mm.
erm  well would,w w would anybody want to advocate that, yes, the  option was to go for collectivization fairly quickly?
Very quickly.
In order to achieve what, just to fulfil their ideological objectives?
Well the Party was  reaction of the sort of the peasants in the villages, if they we if they went straight for collectivization, straight er immediately after the peasants had received this wonderful gift of land in land reform
Right.
and if it was forced upon them that this land's going to have to be put into a, a kind of block
Yes.
erm there'd be a bit of er an anti reaction from the villages towards that and I think that was what they worried about, and that's why they, they adopted a more careful policy of  more, more like suggesting, I E they, they introduced these mutual aid teams and suggested that it would be beneficial for the peasants to join together in these teams.
Right.
Th there, there's, there's nothing, I mean I, I  the points so,i i i in a sense although the revolution had promised the peasant their own land
Mm.
er and that is what  the peasants wanted  I mean th th that was what they thought they were gonna get out of revolution, that was what they wanted to get out of revolution 
That's what they'd been fighting for for twenty years.
Right.
So there certainly wouldn't, are you saying there, there would not have been a, a kind of  groundswell of 
 
from the peasants themselves in order to go for collectivization
No.
and there would have been  not, not immediately  
collective ownership.
Well things like sharing tools and animals.
Yeah.
sharing the plot of land.
Er  well I think some did and some didn't  
But er as a, as a peasant would you have wanted to share land?
I think  
 
putting their, putting plots together and you know 
Mm.
disseminating these square metres   and sort of  plots and stuff like that.
I mean if you  your land I mean okay  
Yeah.
What are you saying  
 
I'm saying the peasants wanted more land.
Of, of their own?
Of their own, yeah.
Yeah.
Is, is there a difference between owning ten acres of  and owning ten acres of ?
 

Erm yeah I 
If you work your own land you will work it until you're dead to the bone.
If you've got ten people  I mean there's no guarantee they're gonna work as well you.
.
Exactly.
 

But, but wasn't the, the emphasis behind the, the communist approach at this time was that  er er up until nineteen fifty  that, that  private enterprise in itself would, would be the means by which output increased.
They said if you give the peasant the land it will give them the enthusiasm to work hard, they will increase their output.
Now  that might be wrong but i surely that was the reality of the time, that was the expectation, that was the whole  idea that was coming over in terms of, of sort of propaganda and policy, whatever you want to, to call it.
And if, if, I think there, there was a very deep belief within the  that they wanted to own their own land.
Now  if, if you take those bits  er wouldn't one have to argue that, that the move into capitalization was straight away 
Mm.
was  w would not go down very well,i it, it would mean overturning the whole emphasis of policy and it would mean going against   So you, A you would have to change your policy, B you would have to force the process.
Erm  but  didn't the peasant culture already have  erm sort of elements of collectivization alread I mean which the Communist Party could 
Yes.
build upon.
Right.
Fine.
But w but th but that is, that is different to erm
To having a policy
to, to having a collectivization policy an and moving forward so that immediately into socialism.
Mm.
Also one would have to work out whether peasants were subsistence minded in that how that once they'd achieved their subsistence was that all they would want or would they really want to sort of erm work harder and start sharing all their tools and implements in order to gain an even higher productivity.
Would they have a high leisure preference for example.
In that how would they prefer not to work so hard 
yes right.
they just keep a certain level of 
Yes.
Right.
Which  that, that then gets you into the issue of whether you are deliberately going to being creating a rich peasant economy and s erm so using the rich peasant economy as the leading sector.
Wi will you come on to talk about that at all?
Mm not  
What was the erm what was the link between the rich peasant  as the economy  industrialization?
Well what, what might have been?
Well erm the creation of surplus for investment I suppose.
Right, yes.
Right.
The Communist Party certainly thought, I mean the reason wh one of their justifications for preserving the rich peasant economy was that how that it's thought the middle peasants would want to try to rise up to br 
Yeah to be rich peasants.
erm erm  yeah, to rich peasants and that how that that's how why they couldn't encroach their interests because then 
Yes.
it would erm  you know, alienate the middle peasants for
Yeah.
but whether that was true
Right.
Now I think that is true
mm.
erm and surely this, this is the implication that we were talking about last week, that erm if, if you are going to  promote industrialization which is now the aim  somebody's gotta produce a surplus for investment for that.
Erm and  it's er within the countryside it's going to be a rich peasant who's going to do that.
So you nee you've got to create or preserve a group who have a surplus over and above subsistence.
They're a group that you can tax.
They're a group which is able to save and invest.
Er so you promote that rich peasant economy.
If you're pr promoting that rich peasant economy, you are hoping that middle peasants will be upwardly ambitious and mobile and, and will also move up to be, to be rich peasants.
And erm  where's the labour supply going to come from?
You couldn't just 
Well there's, there's still, as we've seen there's still a, a very big group of poor.
Yeah  rural poor   sort of shift into the towns.
Well yes you, you, you've got two , one is you've got erm the rural poor who will provide a labour force in the countryside for rich peasants  and you've, because you have got a labour market and because there are no limits on mobility, then presumably there will be some poor peasants who will decide  no I'll get out, I'll  industry's going to get going, I will be able to earn more money in a town, or sons would go off and, and so, so there should be, you should provide a, have a supply of labour, whereas if you've got everybody, if everybody had been in middle peasant status  erm  there would have been no incentive to do that because everybody would have been self sufficient within the countryside.
So  so that the promotion of a rich peasant economy is the way to finance and support industrialization.
This is what they thought?
This is what they thought.
Well I, I mean  assumptions about rich peasant    what's he gonna do, buy a factory or something?
I mean 
Well they're  investment themselves, if you take it off them in tax then  
Or, or, or you, you've got some  financial institutions through which  savings.
Mm.
But if you had a rich peasant economy that you're gonna tax all the time, I mean he's not gonna  much is he?
Was er, was this industrialization envisaged being a sort of purely urban thing, or were they trying to encourage er rural industry as well?
Erm  rural industry is being encouraged in that no rural industrial commercial enterprises are being confiscated
so, so you are, you are encouraging that  and presumably if anybody sets anything up they're going to be able to keep it.
But if, if  if this is the strategy which is being adopted in  broadly it is being adopted  I mean I'm, I'm not just sort of arguing just for the sake  of arguing, it is  
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
it is, is the policy  i i is, is  would you need to set this up as, as it being a long term   I E ho how quickly would you expect that kind of process to work through?
Well it takes, I mean if  to start off with you've gotta get rich peasants to save some surplus and then see  he's not gonna invest every single surplus in one year cos the harvest next year might be no good so you've got the sort of vagaries of the Chinese weather situation so you've obviously gotta sort of stock up
Yeah.
and erm I imagine 
Yes.
so erm investing into industry which I don't know  much about, and I, I am suspicious that  invest into industry anyway erm so  it's gonna have, to work it'll have to be quite a long term policy, well I imagine it wouldn't be a short-term policy .
So in,rational grounds y y you would be arguing that, that if we're going to set this policy up we're going to have to accept that  i it's going, it is going to be a long term policy.
Yeah.
And, and therefore you, you  recognizing that, you would be seeking to make statements about  erm  sort of giving reassurances to the rich peasant that this is
Yeah.
that this is, is not something that's going to change.
 
But in terms of industrialization itself 
I would, I would've thought it would take  
Yeah.
But they didn't give a didn't  issue any documents of reassurance to the rich
Mm.
Mm.
Wh what, why  how, how is this industrialization programme then working in terms of eventual collectivization?
What w i is there a relation between  industrialization and collectivization?
Not directly but you can make one in that how that once everybody gets, once you have the resources to raise everybody up to a certain sort of acceptable standard of living, then you can redistribute those resources and you are, you are,y you'll be able to eliminate  poverty
Right, yes.
well not totally but
Right that, that bit of it is fine.
But is, is collectivization just the reorganization of land?
Or does collectivization imply mechanization?
Mm.
Yeah.
I think it implies mechanization and more control as well of the labour force
Yes.
cos surely the quickest way to industrialize would be directives  funds 
Yes, that, that bit of it is fine but surely  if collectivization implies that you mechanize as well, you need industrialization in order to be able to mechanize.
So that you can have the resources to pay for it all.
Well er er er the er the A the resources to pay for it, B  er the capacity to create mechanization.
So you need a rich peasant economy to finance industrialization  to provide the mechanization  to enable you to go on to collectivization.
Now  that's going to be quite a long term process isn't it?
So if, if one is accepting that, that strategy  you would expect there to be statements along the lines of er ye yes this is going to be a long term process, etcetera.
It's a long term process in order to achieve their  means so I mean 
Yes.
in the  
 
it's a short-term objective  would you say?
Er  er  but, but
Isn't it?
th th th as you said  the, the means to the end has changed
Yes.
and the end is lo is now further off 
Further off.
Mm.
What I can't reconcile is what was the rich peasant .
I mean look at the chain of events which is bullshit.
The rich peasant  I'm gonna save some money right, I'm gotta finance industry so we mechanize so you collectivize and take it all of me .
Stuff that.
So, so as a rich peasant you've got doubts about this?
Yes.
So I've got to reassure you?
But I mean if, if you know what the plan is, yeah.
But I've got to reassure you?
Certainly.
Er er er my reassurance has got to be look this is a long way off.
But would the peasants trust the Communist Party?
I mean even if you did provide reassurances, just  because the peasants were well aware of the fact that hardl although they'd been given lands and their  had been er the lan you know the previous  been destroyed, the Communist Party could take back their land tomorrow if they wanted to.
So whatever reassurance the Party gives, what matters more is whether the peasants actually genuinely erm trusted the Communist Party and had 
W w w er what alternative has the rich peasant got?
Okay so he doesn't trust them  
But if he doesn't trust them then they're not  then the Communist Party isn't gonna be able to fulfil their expectations of trying to change the peasants' mentality to increase production.
But isn't it in the, the rich peasant's interests to increase his production?
Well not if he  
taxed.
You can just say I'm gonna take this off you 
Yes, you could do that, so, so y you go for erm a very high rate of taxation or you go for a lower rate of taxation which is
Yeah.
will encourage income increases etcetera.
But I mean th th the rich peasant hasn't got much to lose has he?
I mean 
But then he may not invest it, he may just consume.
He may, he might just consume.
Right.
Th th th there is that danger  
money under the er might keep it under the floorboards.
Yes.
Right, yeah.
Was there some sort of erm  financial institution created like a national bank or anything like that?
Er  the banking sector is nationalized, yes.
And, and a  bank is set up.
But w but we, we you were saying were there these , yes 
Mm.
I think there were.
Mm.
Erm  the  being  nineteen fifty er  preserving, this is a quote,preserving a rich peasant economy is of course not a temporary but a long term policy.
Only when the conditions mature for the wide use of mechanical farming for the organization of collective farms and for the socialist reform of rural areas er can the need for a rich peasant economy cease and this will take a somewhat lengthy time to achieve .
So the
Depends on 
Right.
And er would you be reass reassured by that?
Mm.
Yes and no that, you know, okay so alright my  perhaps it won't change but  end of the day  invest into industry and  gonna lose some of your land.
Right.
But what, what more can the Party do to reassure?
I it is saying look we're not gonna take any of your industrial commercial properties, those are, those,tho those are safe.
But we're saying 
  
we are, we are encouraging the rich peasant, I mean we want you to settle down and become rich  and, although we have this ultimate aim of socialization, collectivization, we've got to industrialize first  and that, that is a long time off.
compensate.
Perhaps.
Well I'm not saying I'm not gonna compensate.
I don't know, I mean if I was a rich peasant I would be 
Yes.
Especially with the past experience as well.
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Well you can't create stability, the Communist Party can't sort of I mean cos that's  what, sort of hindering  long term investments and that how peasants don't feel that how that things are secure, they  and  it's difficult to see what the Communist Party could've done 
Yes.
Th th th if y if you're looking at this from the Communist Party perspective, I, I think one  i i i i it seems a reasonably sensible s s strategic choice t go for the kind of programme  because the alternative would be collectivization.
The only experience of collectivization there'd been was the Soviet one and  they seemed to have known at least something about the Soviet , they knew it involved a lot of force  they knew that if you were going to collect you were going to collectivize you needed the mechaniz well they thought that you needed the mechanization first  and they knew that they d A they didn't have the capacity for that mechanization  they didn't want to use force  I mean i it would,i it would have been very dangerous, wouldn't it, to go back to the countryside  collectivization .
I mean there, there would have been presumably enormous opposition to that and in the process output would have almost certainly fallen  an an and er there were no resources for mechanization so collectivization as a short-term option is really out.
But isn't then the only option to go for this longer term one creation of a rich peasant economy?
 
 
Er in order to do that I've got to give you various  reassurances.
Mhm.
And even then you're a bit dubious and then you say well I'm gonna wait and see about this.
So I, I, I mean I, I  Well that's where the propaganda comes in isn't it?
I think  
Yeah.
But the kinds of things  saying here are, are really very favourable towards a rich peasant economy  
?
Erm  I can't remember.
Erm it's new in about May nineteen fifty.
 
The Communist Party did though, through those taxation policies and that how that initially it was quite progressive, the taxation 
Yes.
when the need, when they depended upon the peasants' support and then 
Right.
in between nineteen fifty one fifty two, once their position was more secure they could afford to actually favour the rich peasants more  
Right.
low, by erm raising the sort of base rate from three percent to six percent and lowering the top
Right.
rate so that actually showed 
Yes.
their commitment towards it.
Right.
Right s s so, so part of  what we, we, we will er be looking for is a kind of policy which would seem to favour the rich peasant, would seem to reassure the rich peasant, that, that's
You need some direct action.
That's why I mean like 
Right  right.
Communist Party just to say things people aren't really going to erm  change
Right.
their attitudes, but if 
Right.
they actually do something positive 
Right.
Yeah.
then that might make a difference.
Yes.
So if this is our strategy, we've clearly got to favour the rich peasant.
Th th that we er we, we are moving a long way away from this egalitarian position, we've abandoned that and we've said right we, we are  
 
if we're going to industrialize the way  has got to be through the promotion of a rich peasant economy.
So in a sense you are, you are in a sense almost promoting ine sort of inequalities within the countryside.
And there's an economic rationale for that.
Economic rationale in that how they're the most productive  and the most efficient, mm.
They are the most productive section.
Yes.
But you see the thing is that how, what complicates all this is that at the same time the Communist Party is trying to achieve greater equality and how that this isn't their, their sole objective.
So that's why their policies might seem a little bit wishy-washy in that how that if they were going straight for a rich peasant economy then perhaps you would have expected  a more spectacular economic growth, but there wasn't and perhaps this was because they didn't actually go positively just for a rich peasant economy, they were trying to achieve a greater degree of erm egalitarianism in the countryside at the same time.
How were they doing that?
Well just through, I mean like land ref land reform in itself isn't erm efficient.
No it's more political than that because  association you're still giving a landlord a bit of land which means 
Right.
And they couldn't've well  for example with taxation, they could've erm not taxed the rich peasants at all and then just put all their erm  their sort of focus upon the poor peasants and got their income through them  and also with land, they could've just not given any land to poor peasants who were inefficient and given it all to the rich peasants and really gone for a capitalist state.
What, would you say that would've helped the growth of the economy even more?
So in some way they were making economy  by not doing that?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yes.
There is  erm  the promotion of the rich peasant economy is, doesn't, er you're saying i it's not, it is an aim
Mhm.
it is not the only aim
Yeah.
that  at the same time you're actually trying to assume a policy  of equality?
Greater equality.
Greater equality.
Right.
Now on the face of it those two seem, they're gonna conflict aren't they?
I just have one qualification in that how that their main aim is erm to  erm  promote a rich peasant economy, that is their
Right.
most fundamental aim
Right.
because they see that in the long term benefiting, leading to greater equality.
Right.
So erm 
Er because er but only because that will  oh, no i i er does, does the development of a rich peasant economy itself promote equality?
No it doesn't, but it gives them the means to promote it.
Ah.
So, so y y y you're sort of inequality in order to get equality?
That if, if you  promote the rich peasant economy you can industrialize, you can then collectivize and it's collectivization
Yes.
which ultimately is going to provide your equalization.
So they don't see it as  two conflicting aims, they see er the two sort of complementing one another.
Bu bu but inequality is the means to equality?
And you, er that implies you're prepared to see inequalities widening  in the short, perhaps even the medium term.
And, because a 
 
as the rich peasant economy gets going  obviously there are going to be some rich getting richer and there are gonna be some poor getting poorer.
But  that's fine as long as the Communist Party can control this sort of growth, and that's why they introduced the mutual aid teams to sort of counter the 
Ah right, yes.
er the polarization of society.
I mean it seems a bit ironic in that how that what the Communist Party had been striving to eliminate for the past twenty years, they're now going back to recreating differences in society, but the most fundamental change is that how feudalism has gone.
Right.
You have a different kind of 
Yes.
exploitation.
So you, yes we, we've got the end of feudalism, and then we, we've got this promotion of the rich peasant economy, the promotion of inequalities but at the same time  you might need to come in to protect the ri the poor at the bottom  because you don't want those inequalities to get too great.
Mhm.
In fact wh wh wh what you want is the promotion of a rich peasant economy without equality, inequalities emerging.
You can't can you?
Which is going to be very difficult.
Right.
So there are, there are problems with this sort of policy in terms of, of the, like the economic logic of it is that yes you go for a rich peasant economy which creates inequalities which will provide you with industrialization, which will then enable you to get back to inequalities  but, in term back to equality
the problem is that you've actually got inequalities being promoted in, in the meantime which you have, you might want to do something about.
So we might expect there to be a, a set of policies coming in to, to ease the creation of that inequality.
Okay.
Erm  is,i i i is this okay?
C c before we, we move on,c can I just ask if we c could look at this in a different way?
Er  where, where has class conflict gone in all of this?
of feudalism
Yeah.
and trying to get to socialism but it's, it's the government who are doing the work.
Surely there should be no more class conflict  it should be all class er cooperation,working together.
 

But, but there, there, yes but there are still classes.
Yes but then they're  still  to erm  to  against each other.
How do you make progress through socialism other than through class conflict?
We've already had the class conflict though haven't we?
Yes.
You've got rid of the landlords who have been mainly exploiters and so
But how do you make further progress without conflict?
Er 
Create a proletariat?
What?
Create a proletariat?
Mhm.
God.
Starting again then.
I don't understand.
Well n n start, of course you're starting again because the processes of recreating a class struggle is the same in each phase.
You're trying to do the same thing but whereas in feudal exploitation
Ah.
it's, even though you want to er if
Ah yeah.
you've got a real true capitalist economy and industrialization the proletariat is gonna be the vanguard of the revolution.
Ah.
But I can't see them setting up a situation where they're gonna exploit their own workers 
No they're not gonna exploit their own workers but surely the, the, the whole idea of the build up towards land reform is that you are making, I mean in a Marxist sense it's the only way in which you can do it  is, is you make progress through conflict.
I mean we, we clearly do not have a socialist society even at the end of land reform as we, as we've seen in a sense we've created a, a private enterprise system which is based on equalities within capitalism.
But are inequalities needed  for class conflict, for progress?
What would've happened if  absolute egalitarianism had been pursued and absolute egalitarianism had worked  and there was enough land for everybody to come up to a middle peasant status  and you'd created an absolutely e equal society?
Everyone would be happy.
I think it would be cool.
Right.
I could've run with that.
That would be okay would it?
Yeah I think 
No because what's stopping it from going on to any erm  what's stopping it from becoming capitalist and
It is capitalist, and everybody will, would've been given their own land.
Everybody would have enough land to reach subsistence level, everybody would be a capitalist
I think  
would own the means of production there would be subsistence.
er the communists wouldn't be very happy about that  the ownership of production is  this is, this is the problem.
Yes.
So they want collective ownership.
So how are you gonna get out of that?
if you've already got successful   economy ?
Yes.
Well there's no out then.
So you'd be stuck?
Yeah, there's no, there's nowhere to go.
Cos well you know why would, why would  do that?
Right.
And where, where would be the, the forces from within the peasantry be coming from to, to change that?
 

Right and there's no expl there's no exploitation, there's no classes, there's no conflict, no way forward.
Don't know.
Where would you go?
Where would you go?
Wh what, how can you progress more than, than you'd be equal, there'd be  enough to eat?
But that  
I mean what's what's a sort of better thing to happen than that?
But that is not socialist.
It isn't communism.
What?
It's not socialist.
But, you know, what, what would be, what would be a rural socialist erm
Well, see it's er er er er  w is it satisfactory to have a rural economy which is subsistence?
I mean okay  all of you as, as middle, middle peasants were reaching subsistence level  how is that gonna help industrialization?
How, how is industrialization gonna help us?
  
I it won't i but it won't, it won't impinge on you at all.
I mean i i i if you were gonna sit there saying I'm okay, I'm, I can reach a reasonably comfortable business level, this is great, this is what I've always wanted to do
Mm.
y y y you've got no surplus so you can't save, you can't invest, you're not gonna buy any consumer goods.
Erm  productivity isn't gonna rise very much.
You're stuck.
You'd need to, that's why they nee er the Communist Party was going for progress in ord so that the peasants would see that socialism was a good sort of goal  isn't it?
But social er er er pr precisely o o on, on Dave's point  that socialism would not be a goal for a middle peasant economy because you would be quite happy where you were.
So you wouldn't have any idea of wanting to improve your lot further?
Well would, would you?
I think that  
 
answer, I mean some people would be totally happy to yeah, fine   but I'm sure there'll be other people who, you know, I want some more er
Yes.
But  there would be  i i in terms of a communist strategy, in terms of an ideology  there would be nothing within the countryside which would be promoting that  movement towards socialism, that, that change through class conflict would there?
I mean if, if, if you create a society in which you have only one class  and it is a, an owner-occupation, in a sense, small scale subsistence capitalist class, everybody is roughly the same within that  there is no form of momentum is there?
Well I'm not entirely sure.
I mean  you, you could argue that  inequalities give,pr provide momentum  because then there's er introduce, introduce conflicts
Yes but of necessity.
but is, is it, is it therefore true that a system which does introduce conflicts therefore can progress?
I mean I'm, I'm not sure it is.
It can't progress through socialism?
Through democracy.
Or out of er  in terms of production can't progress.
In a Marxist context it, it cannot because the only way in which you can make progress is through co class conflict.
Yeah.
But you might be able to do it some other way.
Mm 
Sorry?
The Communist Party 
You call them a communist party?
 

But you see China was different compared to erm places like Russia and wherever and so  you can't just strictly sort of use the Marxist model and apply it to China and what the Com 
Well you should be able to.
Chinese Communist Party was doing, well why should you?
Yeah so that's the classic claim of Marx's model innit?
It's like the theory of history.
You should be able to  
Well maybe the Communist Party realized that it wouldn't work.
 

Why are they a communist party then?
I mean  
 
But is, is, is is it possible that  it is actually very useful to have classes, to, to have inequalities?
I E  
 
Well yeah I there, there, there is, I'm not saying that this and er and I do see what you're saying, yeah.
I E
In what way?
In the political sense in that how , yeah.
Yes politically.
I i in terms of mobilization, in terms of, of revolutionary struggle, in terms of revolutionary progress.
Er it, it does seem to me it would've been an enormous problem for the Chinese Communist Party had absolute egalitarianism worked.
It would have left them with, with no mechanism to go forward.
They actually had a vested interest in having inequality within the coun er er because it, it  retained classes and therefore potential class conflict within the countryside and therefore it offered a way forward to socialism.
But isn't it sort of very much an  view, you know this  that this is the theory for justification for the, their  policy or was it theoretical erm ?
Er  production.
Yes.
Erm  well e e 
 

I, I quite agree.
Absolutely.
Erm but one, one  one, I mean cl clearly  the policy which was pursued was one of inequality and there was a rich peasant economy  and either you say well yes there is, there is an economic imperative for that and that's the explanation  or you say well there might have been a political factor involved in this  that there was a recognition that progress was going to come through class conflict  and therefore  if you are actually promoting the kind of   you might realize it was happening and you might be more prepared to  
Mm.
Because you would be saying well if we have classes this provides us with a way forward for the future  in a way that if we have absolute egalitarianism  that, how would we make progress through to socialism?
But why did they go for absolute egalitarianism in the first place then?
Was it just so that they could, for political means again to get  peasant support?
Erm, yes.
Yes if, if you go back  forty six forty eight that was it.
So you're saying that they were driven more by there political desire for power than by their ideology because had absolute egalitarianism worked then they should have been satisfied with that because then they were fulfilling their ideology.
Yes.
But it obviously hasn't worked.
No but you were saying before that had it worked it would've given them a problem.
The way I 
It would've done.
I see it is that had it worked it would have fulfilled their ideology.
It would have fulfilled their ideological aims.
Why is that?
W w w cos, cos one aim is  equality, the other aim is socialism.
Mm.
But don't you get equality through socialism?
Isn't that the aim?
Yes.
Rather than equality  
Absolutely, yes.
And they're also looking for progress too, they want to increase 
Right.
everybody's 
S s so we're looking for, in a sense, for three things, one is  is er paving the way for industrialization, one is equality, one is the ideological movement to socialism and somehow you've got to allow for all of those three.
And I think in a way absolute equality would've provided a problem in terms of both  paving the way for industrialization because you would have created a subsistence economy and that would not have helped anybody.
Secondly I think it would actually have created problems in terms of ideology.
This whole idea of a subsistence economy  is something I'm not really, I'm not really sure about it because erm  what, what would exactly, you're saying that if everybody was the same then erm then you're somehow necessarily going to be producing at a subsistence level  so   erm  so er and so it's, so if you can only extract surplus by effectively taking it off something given to others.
Yes.
So you're virtually condemning some people to operate below subsistence
Yes.
in order to allow other people to extract a surplus which you then give 
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
So why, why, why can't you just erm  why can't they just take a bit off everybody in that case and, and inflict the same degree ?
Cos you're inflicting, you're inflicting  or, or people at the very bottom of the scale, you're forced to operate below a level of subsistence because  inequalities.
Yes.
So why don't you just run a middle peasant economy but take what you need from everybody else?
But surely state intervention should have been the best way of achieving both goals?
But how could the, the s 
By taxing people.
how, how would the state have the means to intervene?
Just go give us your taxes, build a few factories.
Where are they gonna get these, how can they impose taxes unless there's some kind of  a healthy economy?
You know an economy that's 
Well I mean 
collapsing and is in such a state.
there is, no, cos there's a surplus right?
But there's
There will, I mean
but, but would there?
I mean is,
Yes but how great is this surplus?
Well look there's a finite amount of resource in the economy.
You've got some rich people, you've got some poor people.
Yeah right.
Right?
Now there's gonna be a surplus no matter who you give it to, no matter where, I mean 
Why?
Why?
That surplus probably has  
Because those people on subsistence level are surviving right, and if they're surviving
Yeah.
it means that they're there and that if you take something away from the wealthy peasants and equalize
Yeah.
amongst your old'uns, whatever  
 
but it is gonna be
But isn't there a, a different expenditure pattern between the rich and the poor?
That 
Yeah yeah but erm what I'm saying is you can tax them  take that surplus, cream it off, create an equal society  direct state intervention  invest it in factories, whatever.
Right.
I don't think it'll really help, I mean
No.
But, but i i i i if you went  yes I mean er in a sense that th there are  one possibility is to redistribute the land, and do that equally, but if, if there, there was not enough land to bring everybody up to subsistence level  er I mean some were, the, the argument is there wasn't enough land to bring everybody up to a landlord's subsistence level.
Or at best everybody could just come up to but nobody would be creating re er a surplus, nobody would have the resources to invest to enable them to come above subsistence
Yes.
and if you then taxed you would, you would pushing everybody down below.
Right.
And tha that is no way  then that is no way forward.
What I'm  
 
Yeah.
Yeah but as far as I can see there either is a surplus or there isn't, you know, that it shouldn't depend on where you organize the a aggregate.
Why not?
If y the way, if you  
Because any sur any surplus you're extracting from rich peasants is an artificial one because it's only based on, you know, basically imposed suffering of poor peasants.
You're not allowing
Bu but, but the rich  because they have more resources are more highly productive.
So they have a higher income.
Yes.
Which you can then tax.
And you will be able to,y y you, your tax revenue will rise because you've got a group that is rich.
And then  but also with the poor peasants I mean you, you've given them a, enough land so that they, they still can't meet subsistence, given them some land but not enough, but you know because they're resourceful and they've got other things that they, they don't need to have enough land to give subsistence, they'd rather go and do something else and make it up.
So that therefore in, I mean it's like a form  they just  they just get by.
 

Yeah but I, but I cos I can see the arguments but then  I mean I'm just not, I'm not entirely sure whether i i it couldn't work, that it couldn't work being a middle peasant economy and that these erm these inequalities would er sort of 
Y y y you could certainly extract a sur er extract a surplus for the government
Yeah.
which the government would then have spent on the industrial sector  so agriculture would not have moved forward.
And no middle peasant would have then had the investment resources to improve his own  
 
I E the, the agricultural sector would, would not be left with enough resources to improve.
And 
Why do say that?
I mean  why, er with this surplus they've gathered, I mean what you're saying is that the rich peasant economy effectively are better investors
Yes.
they're more productive
Yes.
but that needn't be the case.
I mean if the government is er taxing and pr channelled that money  properly  then it should be able to do the job of private investors
so surely the arguments hinge upon the fact that perhaps the government is likely to be inefficient, corrupt, bureaucratic, whatever.
Possibly but i i if, if you say it is a,i it's an honest government and er er the tax collection is, is straightforward and honest, the government is then deciding what it does with that tax revenue.
I, I E you, you're saying in effect that the government is taking all of the surplus from the, from agriculture?
Yeah.
What little surplus, what little 
Yeah that's what I'm sa 
surplus there is, and then it redistributes that surplus and given that the, the, the priority is industrialization  most if not all of that surplus is going to go to the industrial sector.
There will be no resources for the agricultural sector and agriculture probably will not be able to support the industrialization process.
Whereas if you go for a degree of inequality within the countryside, A you will have, you might get the same, same tax yield because you, you have a higher rate of tax on the rich and their revenue's going up so that tax revenue will increase
Mhm.
and you've got a group, the rich within the agricultural sector who are going to invest and they are more likely to invest in agriculture.
You have the problem of how much to tax because on the one hand you're trying to promote this rich peasant economy and not erm tax them too heavily because you don't want to, them to not invest with 
Yes.
and then you also need to have a surplus so that you can erm pay for industrialization, and you can't tax, tax the poor too much to fit into your ideology so at the end of the day, you know, well it's a matter of just balancing all these factors 
Exactly.
Exactly.
to get a compromise.
Right.
So the creation of a rich er along these lines of  the creation of a rich peasant economy  is a necessity as the Communist Party see it in terms of paving the way for industrialization.
It is a better strategy to create resources for industrialization to go for a rich peasant economy than to go for a middle peasant economy.
What I'm also saying is that, that in terms of 
sort of the context of ideology that, you know, from a Marxist perspective it is actually useful still to have rich and poor peasants because potentially you've got classes, you've got class conflict and you've got a means of making further progress towards socialism.
And the two come together.
Wh what you're also saying is, is right though, that within that  the danger is that inequalities get too great and you would also need a set of policies which would stop that inequality.
So you're trying to promote it, but you're trying to limit it.
 
And what, well how do you do that, I mean if
Right.
that is totally inconsistent, if you're trying to create class struggle 
Right.
then you're not gonna stop it, I mean if there's class struggle no one can stop it.
Yes.
Yes.
That, that's gonna be a problem.
that political argument seems, I mean you can't win in this game can you?
If you've got inequalities and everything then you say ah yes, it's all very good, we need this, the Marxist class struggle, I mean that just seems like a ridiculous argument to me.
But w was it, was it the size of China that made this necessary?
You know the sort of uncontrollable nature of, of most of it  that, that meant they had to  get on with it.
I'm not sure size is, is the reason.
I still don't see why, why you're saying the government couldn't  use their erm  policies, fiscal policies with erm  and then actually take an active part in the economy.
Why couldn't they create, improve the agricultural sector by  
I'm not saying, they, they could have done.
Right, but they didn't.
Cos  the various things you've been saying about the rich peasant economy, I mean 
Because, but you don't  you, you well if you've got a rich peasant economy you don't need to because you're saying the rich peasant 
Yeah.
can do it themselves.
But, but it's highly, I mean I don't, it doesn't follow to me that that  in any way is compliant with Marxist ideology  because surely you want to get to your socialist state 
Right.
Mm.
as quickly as possible.
Yes.
So if you could create equality  
 
this er government intervention policy, you'd've achieved your goal.
Erm right.
And I don't see see why 
Yes, yes.
they couldn't've invested in, in agriculture  
Sh sh 
all this in the private sector would've 
sure,th th th that is your other option  is, is that you go for a m a much more equal policy and the, the government takes money in taxation and puts it back into the, the agricultural sector.
Right.
I think the reason they probably did this because it's, it's, it was politically harder to do that, they would've had to taken a lot more responsibility.
Yeah th that was, that was the that was my point about the size of the country, and I think 
Oh right.
Yes.
that so,th that sort of policy would be very, would've been difficult 
you'd have to have a huge sort of bureaucratic structure
Yes.
to invest in .
Right.
So, so sort of technically, politically that would have been quite difficult to do because of the manpower involved etcetera 
Yeah.
etcetera etcetera, yes.
Whereas creating a rich peasant economy  will work immediately cos that's what  a significant number of people in, in the countryside will actually go along with and want.
Mm.
Because it is, it is en it is encouraging people to become rich and basically people want to become rich.
But it seems to me like it's passing the buck a bit in the way they're just sort of taking responsibility
Yes.
Yes.
and saying well you know that if we, if the sort of rich peasants were
Mm.
Yeah.
gonna be pretty safe, it's gonna be pretty stable, we don't have to get our f hands dirty erm you know  
future cos if it doesn't work you can always 
economic  about Taiwan and there's a great deal of irony in this because  you know here you are in the nineteen fifties in China  rich peasant economy which is accepting and preserving inequalities 
Yeah.
and yet you go to Taiwan and there's some sort of,land reform which ends up in, in a very equal distribution
Well exactly
  
what's happening.
A and erm and I think it is being conducted by the government which has just left China
Yeah, that's right.
Yes.
Right.
This,bu but isn't that only because of what they learnt from 
Oh absolutely yes.
their experience of China?
But if erm, if they have learned that why, you know, why didn't the communists?
Perhaps they  
So
which is always 
are you saying that they actually deliberately were trying to  
Right.
Erm  right.
Zoe would you like to, to carry on from 
wherever you want  see, see what you have.
Alright.
What then were the economic effects of land reform and the preservation of the rich peasant economy  and how successful was it in raising productivity?
Land reform had profound impact on the distribution of rural wealth and income and through this on both the motivation and complicity of the rural population to invest, improve farming techniques and to increase production.
The degree of the immediate impact of land reform however is a matter of debate.
The spef specific impact of land reform is extremely difficult to evaluate.
Land reform does not necessarily lead to an immediate rise in output, neither does it increase a physical supply of land, nor does it significantly alter the ratio of peasants for the amount of land available.
Furthermore the exact economic impact of land distribution is difficult to identify in test because output is the function of many other factors besides land distribution per se.
The scope of the economic analysis of the immediate impact of the land reform period is further limited by lack of statistics.
Official  economic data released prior to nineteen fifty two were confusing due to lack of standardization, contents and coverage of data.
According to one, data especially on output for the immediate post land reform period were later corrected and adjusted by officials causing one to question its credibility.
In addition statistical data from the pre land reform period is patchy.
Most historians use Buck's land survey data and statistics erm work by the  for the nineteen thirties to draw comparisons with official data which was collected for tax purposes from nineteen fifty two onwards but there's very little data from the period of land reform itself.
In view of these factors my discussion can be confined to three inter-related aspects of the economic impact of land reform.
Since the agrarian reform swept away the landlord tenant relationship it altered the claims to the output from land.
These effects will be explored first.
As a consequence of the abolition of the landlord tenant structure, reform to the tax structure was necessary.
The second aspect considered here will be how the C C P structured their tax system as a means of both  investment in industry and as an incentive to agricultural productivity.
Finally an assessment will be made as to the effect of redistribution of land reform to agricultural productivity.
So what was the overall effect of rent transfer, of agricultural output as a result of the abolition of rent landlords?estimates that the rental land was thirty three percent of the total land area in ninetee in nineteen thirty and about thirteen percent of the total value of agricultural output was transferred amongst households as rent before land reform.
Land reform primarily meant the diversion of rent payments.
In addition to the redistribution of the actual rent payments the abolition of landlords meant the abolition of other charges, local taxes and surta cha surtaxes, rent deposits and interest payments to landlords.
All of these further contributed to the post land reform potential o of the law set to maintain and increase its income, or for the Communist Party to tax.
I'll now consider how much the peasants actually benefited from these gains and how much they paid in tax after land reform.
Prior to land reform most agricultural taxes were levied to the land itself, assessment per unit of land being graduated according to the quality of land proportional to output.
Land taxes were paid to the  ?
and provisional governments.
Tax evasion and tax  was widespread.
maintains that the actual sums collected by these agents were sometimes as much as ten times what the government received.
She explains that there were generally two stages to changes in the tax system, the tax system initiated by the Communist Party.
There was expansion of the tax based  levied on production per household assessed on the basis of nominal annual y yield.
This was the harvest that could be reasonably be expected in an average year.
The levy was set by cadres based in .
Tax rates were applicable to the total household income derived from agricultural production divided by the number of members in the household who depended primarily on agricultural production.
Commercial income was tax exempt.
During this first stage tax rates were steeply progressive from three percent on a hundred and fifty  per capita per annum to forty two percent.
The C C P's aim was to gain peasant support for land reform and to emphasise class divisions.
Once land reform was under way, the peasant support of the C C P regime was more secure, the C C P implemented a second stage of its tax programme in the newly liberated areas.
From nineteen fifty one to fifty two it re-graduated the progressive tax rates, raising the bottom rate from six percent in the same threshold of a hundred and fifty  per capita per annum, and lowering the top rate to twenty five percent.
The main incentives to agricultural production embodied in the tax system  
 
First production over and above the nominal family unit was free of tax.
Following from this there was thus an incentive for peasants to invest in large scale improvements without fear of tax on rises in productivity because the N A Y was fixed for at least three years.
Further, because the N A Y was based on grain as a standard, this encouraged a switch to cash crops which were of a higher value relative to grain.
The tax system extensively encouraged all peasant owners to settle down and get rich because the tax rate remained fixed on grain output from each household  but the adjustment of the tax rate was more advantageous to the rich peasant than the poor, especially in view of the fact that the rich peasant still owned proportionately more land than the poor peasant.
According to it did not seem to make much difference to  tax on income differentials, rich peasants were still about two and a half times better off than poor peasants.
It appeared however that the Chinese Communist Party was rational in its tax policy, taxation was crucial to the C C P to control inflation and the supply of grain to the People's Liberation Army and the population as a whole.
estimates that in nineteen fifty the tax amounted to nearly forty two percent of the national budget receipt which was clearly a significant contribution.
Turning to the economic impact of land reform on productivity 
Can I just, can I just stop you there for a minute.
To ju and just take taxation bit of it.
Do you understand what Zoe is, is talking about?
Do, do you understand what the tax system is?
No.
No.
 
Right.
Actually you're okay, it was extremely clear but it, it's a, I think it's a complicated issue.
Mm.
Is, is what you're saying that, that  the tax was on  a, a kind of expected yield  that cadres would, would, would go into a village and they would say look erm  that is the normal yield for that bit of land.
On, on, on past experience that's roughly what the yield has been, on an average year you would expect to get that.
And, and we are going to base our taxes on that normal yield.
if the yield is above that, we're gonna keep the tax base the same, so i if, if your yield goes up, if you work harder, if you're more productive  you, you're going to be much better off.
We, we will not raise the taxes because your increment's gone up.
So, so there's that, there's that kind of incentive behind it and, and, and, and that normal yield is, is gonna operate for three years, if there are improvements we're still gonna keep that  the normal yield tax based exactly the same.
So there are significant incentives to improve the land.
So what happens after three years, the er  the yields are sort of therefore reviewed and the  reassessed?
Yes.
How would they do that?
So basically what you, you, what you would be likely to do is rip o rip off the system completely for two years at a time  
Yes, but then  er you face the possibility that  er because your, your, if you like, your normal yield has risen
Yeah, that's it.
you will move into a different sort of tax bracket.
it's a strange  incentives  aren't there?
It's like in the first year  the first year of the three year period you've got an incentive,
Yes.
the second year you increase about as much but the third year you're gonna bring it right down  use hardly anything at all.
 

Yeah but the point is
did they actually  have to claim how much, I mean er you know they produced, cos all we're saying here is they're just taking a  a nominal amount which they stipulate at the beginning of a three year period, and they're just gonna take that.
I mean they're not gonna have any information of how much you've produced over and above your tax.
So how do they follow 
But er but at the same time 
I mean how do they go about reclassifying
Ah.
That's, that's going to be a problem but that's, that's three years off.
And presumably 
No but 
by that time you've got the personnel and you've
Oh I see.
you've got much more information and, and, and you would  
But er what information?
I don't see  
Well  presumably would go back in the village and if you asked other villagers look how much has X grown on that bit of land they will tell you.
Tax erm I can't remember where it was that, I think it might have been one of you saying that how that  a peasant of subsistence level erm would still have to pay eighteen percent of its income
Right.
in taxation but that still the peasant was, even though this might seem like quite a bit, the peasant was still in a better position than  he had been previous because rents were at least thirty percent.
Yes.
Yes.
So
it's a matter of ho I mean er greater equality was achieved, but they could've erm  I mean a hundred and fifty  was a very low threshold  
okay let's just work around that.
What, what you're saying is that  I mean broadly this is, is quite an incentive based system, at least on the face of it
Mm.
er in, in that you, you are, you, you're sort of fixing your taxes and then you're allowing, anybody who increases their output will keep, will benefit from that.
So, so basically it's an incentive system for, to increase production.
And it, it's clear that, that production was higher than, than normal  expectation so it seems to have had a positive effect in terms of.
And you're also saying that, that there is some equalization going on because erm  the tax rate   erm and th th th the top tax rate, at least to begin with, is forty two percent, the bottom tax rate is only three percent.
So there's, there's an equalization going on.
But what you're then saying is that the taxes start at a very low threshold  I E you, you, you start to pay tax  at a hundred and fifty Cantonese  per person.
about eight hundred  for subsistence.
Exactly.
So you are taxing peasants at well below subsistence level.
Now either, either we have,ei either you accept that and  y y you're saying n not only in terms of land reform is the Communist Party prepared to see poor peasants being allocated less than subsistence land  but even when they are allocated land they're being taxed on their income even though it's well below subsistence.
Now  ei either one sort of accepts that view
Would that be because the Communist Party didn't want the rich peasant to think they'd be s they were being singled out?
That how that their policies were being applied to the whole  society.
Would that be 
Erm 
the justification for it?
There's  there was an element of that, yes, that  
Why should they be concerned about the rich peasants?
Because they're promoting the rich peasant economy in the short run.
Yeah but promoting the economy doesn't necessarily  mean
It does if
we wanna keep them happy.
You have to keep them happy in order to  
I mean  inconsistent with what we were saying about
What?
the objective of politically going for a class struggle  
yes, sure.
Well, they're not gonna have any incentive to invest unless they know their interests are gonna be protected.
You know
Invest in what?
Sorry?
In industry?
Yeah.
Or whatever.
I in increasing the surplus, agricultural surplus.
But if, if, if that  beginning, you know,i if you're going to go for a rich peasant economy, you've gotta convince them that it's, it's their advantage and it's gonna last.
There's a sort of, I mean, it is a very favourable tax system in, in relation to the rich.
Okay there might be  in all sorts of ways, in terms of equality, in terms of socialism, it's, it's all a bit dubious  erm but the other reason for taxing down  is that, let's face it, the majority of peasants as we, as we saw last week are still poor  and if the Communist Party is wanting to maximize its revenue, if it was gonna say okay we're not gonna tax anybody at under six or eight hundred   erm you, you're gonna take out er half the population  and you would have to get that income by taxing the rich even harder and that would be a disincentive.
reasonable system wouldn't it?
But it would have been a disincentive on the rich.
Erm  what proportion of the population was living at subsistence level roughly?
Cos, as an idea.
Erm well er er the figures we looked at , well i i i it, this is the problem  it depends how you define your subsistence level.
Now
It varies from village to village doesn't it?
It's gonna vary from village but it's to an extent although the amount of grain you needed, the amount 
Yeah.
of grain  erm
But if we say it's around eight hundred  
Now, yes I mean  i i in, in terms of two thousand calories a day  it, it s it seems to be six hundred and fifty, seven hundred calories, er seven hundred , right, now th th there are those who argue the hundred and fifty  is starvation level.
I E it, it, it's  it's about a quarter so you, you're on five, six hundred calories a day.
So they wouldn't be able to pay the tax would th they wouldn't.
Well i i it implies that the Communist Party is actually taxing p taxing poor peasants at three percent of their income even though they are at starvation level.
But would they, wouldn't they just in practice overlook it?
No.
Erm I, I, there were provisions that where er  more than ten percent of the population for any area was at the level you would be able to tax at a higher rate.
Why, why?
What!
Your revenue I guess, that, that you need the revenue.
Were there, were there people starving?starving.
Well   I ca what I can't quite understand is, is that why anybody should have come through land reform and still only have that level of income.
Erm it may be that the people who were right down at the bottom like that were people who were doing other things as well and were say blacksmiths or whatever
Mm.
a and, and that I think would not be taken into account, so we're just looking at agricultural income 
Oh I see yeah.
and these people were not depending on agriculture alone.
If they are people depending on agriculture along i i it seems an extraordinarily harsh  
Well they'd be forced out wouldn't they?
They would be forced out 
 
yes.
and work in the factories of the, the rich peasants.
The factories of the  I think.
 
Well you know what I mean, workshops or whatever.
Yes.
Yes.
Erm but it might mean that in fact we do need to reconsider what we mean by subsistence income.
I E bare subsistence might have been  three hundred, four hundred .
Now if, if one is arguing that  then the, the number of peasants who are really below a very basic subsistence level as a result of land reform is, is much lower.
Mm.
I mean if, if your cut-off point is six or eight hundred  say six or eight hundred   yo you're gonna, you know, you're into a very large section of the population, if you will come to four hundred and fifty  you are into a much, much smaller proportion.
But you, you're right that if we stick to  somewhere between six hundred and seven hundred as, as a erm even a basic kind of subsistence  I E you've just got enough in just, you, you're just not using enough food to get yourself up to two hundred, two thousand calories a day  at that rate you were still being taxed on,a at a rate of almost twenty percent of your, of your income.
Which meant that net of tax you would,y your, your yield would have to be about eight hundred  in order to, net of tax, give you just under seven hundred.
How could they before pay rents then?
Because that was even more.
Right
Yes.
just don't, you can't reconcile it.
So had they put too high a sort of level for subsistence?
I mean what did peasants expect to live on, what were their expectations?
That's what really matters.
I mean this is  I er er there, there is a, a fundamental problem here I think th that i if you do the calculations in terms of how many calories per amount of grain it does seem that, that for what we regard as being an adequate diet  and then again it's a diet which is not being supplemented by meat  okay there will be some vegetables but basically it's grain, you, you do need somewhere between six and seven hundred .
And it is clear that there were, that a very significant proportion  were not reaching that level and it's being taxed.
But  they are still surviving  and they were surviving and still paying rent on land before nineteen forty nine.
But were they?
Because quite a lot of the peasants didn't
Right.
wa wasn't it when, when we were studying about landlord tenant relationships 
Yeah.
that how that erm  landlords in practice had to reduce the level of taxation
Yes.
have loans and stuff, so it just 
Right.
Yes.
prolonged
Yes.
payments.
Th th th there's all of that and there is obviously the, the option to borrow  and there is the opportunity to work as, as hired labour or handicrafts etcetera.
But the assumption must have been that before nineteen forty nine there was a lot of that going on
Mhm.
more than seemed to be indicated in the figures that we've got, because Buck's figures for the extent of supplementary income are  I know they're significant but they're not enough to  the kinds of levels people had been living at.
But I, I, I think there is a conflict between what we would regard as being a, an acceptable subsistence level and what it would appear that the peasants could possibly have been achieving.
I mean it's, it's difficult to bring those two close enough.
It's, it's hard to, I think there is this erm   farmland  I would imagine a very very hard
Yes.
that may not have involved, been involved in a cash economy.
Yes.
Yes.
 
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
But I think we, we, we do have to recognize that, that not only are we looking at a land reform process which is providing a lot of peasants with what  
 
subsistence land and the Communist Party was taxing them, they were on that below subsistence income.
Now that would not be what one would expect  er two months ago if I'd said well look you know that's  that's what the revolution's gonna bring about you would've said I don't believe you.
The only way you can justify it is by saying it's a means to an end.
But it, you could equally say that well 
Yes.
But at the same time the Party could argue that it was attempting to equalize things or at least limit inequalities in the sense that, that, that the tax rates were .
What i what is really extraordinary I think is the way as you say that in nineteen fifty fifty one, fifty one fifty two, they actually, actually changed the tax schedules so it goes not from the three percent of the bottom, from six or seven percent of the bottom and only up to twenty five percent.
But it could also mean that erm they were getti that it  they had been successful in getting taxation from what they'd done since the beginning of  cos they felt they could go even further.
Yes.
It could apply to their original taxation policy  
Yes.
But, but, but, but it's a it's a major concession to the rich.
A a at precisely the point where one  one would expect them to be in the position to be able to encroach on the rich they are actually  this is, this is the promotion of the rich peasant economy.
Mm.
Could that stem from a problem like  sort of Marxism is really a theory developed from the g an industrialized, industrializing country
Mm.
and you've your idea from that  but then China is a completely backward country.
Oh I see.
But it's not only, it's not only  
There's, there's, there's, there's there's room for it in, in Marxist theory isn't there?
Yeah there is.
What about Asiatic methods of production and all that sort of thing  
Yes.
I think they were originally for it, I just think there's  it is just so backward
Mm.
that there haven't been any forces of change for a thousand years.
I mean perhaps the forces of change that were normal were not inherent in the Chinese
Yes.
so that they really had to be brought out.
Yes.
Or created even.
Yes.
Absolutely.
Yes I mean th th th th the fact that you've got a whole range of problems  an an and you, you were bound to come up against those problems if you try and define Marxist  in a strict sense, and therefore you, you were always seeking to  sort of make .
Can we just come back to 
Mm.
Can you just go on with your productivity bit.
Okay.
What I'll do is I'll just quickly skim 
Yes.
through the stuff.
Erm that offic regarding productivity from economic impact of land reform, official statistics claimed that between nineteen forty nine to fifty four gross output value of agriculture increased by fifty eight percent.
Erm those are the only sort of figures we have and, but nineteen forty nine seemed to be a bad base state because it was about half  so that meant that it exaggerate .
Erm that had er most economic histor historians agree that between nineteen fifty two, nineteen fifty fifty two there was a healthy recovery and then a slackening off  and that erm another consequence of land reform was to decrease the output marketed by peasants and this was because, as we mentioned earlier, the peasants have a high propensity to consume and lower marketing  land was rich peasants erm  and that  one says that there was a new air reported then in the countryside unleashing unprecedented wave of  productive enthusiasm, initiative and creativeness but there was also evidence of instability and uncertainty which hindered erm the advance of erm productiv improving productivity and investment.
Erm  and that how that but through land reform  it meant that how that you had erm credit difficulties and that how that landlords who prev previously provided the credit were no longer there and so that meant that how that erm  that exasperated problems of increasing productivity and also there was a severe shortage of farm implements and animals cos they weren't redistributed, there was only the surplus that was taken away from the rich peasants and landlords, it meant that how that the, the rich peasants erm  you know, got back er they sort of were a self-perpetuating elite in that how the poor peasants just didn't have the means to improving their production.
Erm so the Communist Party, to try to counter this sort of erm advance of the rich peasant economy which they saw was getting a bit too far, tried to encourage the formation of mutual aid teams erm but they were very, there were problems in that  in erm the implementation of this because peasants were unwilling to share their tools, they weren't compensated for it.
Also peasants joining the mutual aid teams feared that erm it would hinder their opportunities of working in other forms of erm er getting other forms of income and that  says that only twelve point six percent of the total farming households in Penang, which was quite a progressive place for mutual aid erm teams, er erm  were members of MATs in nineteen fifty two.
erm  I, in m I  in my opinion that the Communist Party aim of increasing productivity wasn't actually achieved and because of all these problems erm could  that their policy of favour of erm promoting rich peasant economy didn't significantly contribute to industrialization erm I mean there was a little bit of an economic growth but that it wasn't particularly significant.
However the agrarian reforms of nineteen fifty wasn't a complete failure and it did provi er play a vital step in socialist transformation of agriculture.
It had got rid of this, the old order and new power relations had been established and so it shouldn't be regarded so much as an economic failure but as a profound political and social reform, which is an important step towards the Party's ultimate aim of communism, and going back to the beginning of my paper that how that they had always seen industrialization as a means to an end and that how that socialism and ultimately communism could only be achieved through stages and so that, although it was an economic failure, it was a sort of a social
Yes.
success.
Fine.
S so the, the, the really important  outcome of land reform is the political and social changes  not the economic changes
Yes.
and although it is being set up to promote a rich peasant economy in order to pave the way for Chinese industrialization, that has not been particularly successful  either in terms of the level of output and therefore the levels   or in terms of inequalities in that one of the, one of the worrying things that comes through, that comes through, despite the tax system there are still very substantial inequalities and  i is the promotion of mutual aid a means, a perceived means of reducing or containing those inequalities?
Yes but in practice it, it didn't really work because the Communist Party didn't really  erm sort of make a concrete commitment to promoting them and just encouraged them 
And n u up until nineteen fifty two?
Yes and then afterwards.
Right.
But what, when they do get going it is, it's clear that the mutual aid  process does reduce inequalities
Erm
in that productivity within mutual aid teams goes up.
I, I mean 
But I mean  you see the problem is that how the rich  erm rich peasants  two different mutual aid teams which meant that how that they didn't ha the resources they were sharing were pretty much the same.
But, but their productivity still did rise within the mutual aid, of the poor.
It, it's the poor that go into mutual aid teams 
Yes.
their productivity rises
Is it only marginally though?
Well  but it comes up to closer to the productivity of the independent middle peasant.
Mhm.
Perhaps this is, this is something we could  we could, we could use to talk about in some revision seminar at the beginning of next term cos we, we, we've sort of got up to nineteen fifty two  erm maybe it would be helpful if, if sort of you know we just sat there over the vacation and then come back and sort of have  look 
 
and see where this has got us.
Erm  is, is that acceptab 
Sorry yeah I, I 
It's, it's not your fault it's, I mean there are  once you get into this topic it becomes quite a big one.
Erm but if, if you can have a look at, at some of the taxation stuff and about the mutual aid  
 
and, and pull the things together a bit.
Well the mutual aid people should look at the 
Yes.
and also for taxation  is very sort of there's one chapter which  quite sort of 
?
Yes.
So the second one, yeah?
The second one, yes.
And that, I mean it's very very readable and I think if you just read those two books that should give you quite a good  
 
But doesn't talk, he does only talk about the economic 
Erm Wong, are you talking about Wong, that blue one?
No it was the erm
It does everything doesn't it?
It does everything.
Well Wong 
So basically if you read Wong you're laughing.
Yeah but  
You're laughing
