Well, have I been there?
No, erm  there's an office there isn't there?
Or  have we got an office in Hampton Court?
No, I don't think we have.

Only Tracey would do that.
Our Trace.

Yeah.

Tt.
I've got a sore throat  and a bit of a cough.
And I do feel genuinely rough.

Ooh yeah.
Oh here's some Marmite crisps if you want any?

Okay.

So I had a bath  and I thought it'd warm me up but I was, I was freezing  weren't I?
Yeah.
And I had to get the old erm  quilt down.
Mm mm.
I don't believe I'm bad

Yes.
I think.
Yeah.
I wonder if we could get away with telling my mum  that we'll go away for Christmas and New Year.
Why, you going away?
Well she's going away anyway.
Oh yes you

Maybe
perhaps the Monday after Christmas, and then coming back the Monday after.
And I'll ask  
Maybe you could connect the tape  to the television and then have a film on and just leave it running.


So the ac that's the actual script.
I think it'll be fairly obvious somehow.
What's that?


Did you win or lose?
Not a lot.
Lost.
You lost?
 
Where was it today?
Mm dear.
Ah no, racing, ah, it's cos I bought a horse, that's why

No I backed the first winner today and that got me out of trouble.
Er, don't give her those.
Why?
Give her a brick .
No, she actually just, I haven't seen for a long time so she can have one of these.
No, but that's excessively  for her.
It's not cos she only gets a little bit.
Where's Jussy?
Dunno.

I like this one.
hot chocolate  two rounds of toast 
And that one at erm 
and a piece of er, ginger cake.
stopped at the tea rooms after  completely over the top ordering.
All the  all this food started  turning off .
Completely, the chocolate, hot chocolate with bloody whipped cream on the top and everything.
God!
I wish I'd  cycled six miles home!
So you worked it all off again.

Wash her hair.

Sweet, no less.
One very  small knife for slicing the mushrooms.
Deep emancipation.

Yeah, not too bad.
Could be better?
Could be worse?
Well, it can always be better can't it?
It is 
Thing was  I knew he'd forgotten something.
I was just looking for something.
You see, I could tell these things.

And lo and behold there isn't.
Come on, chop chop!

Well and truly in the bath.
In the  triathlon?

Second out the water or something?
Yes.
First, first .
Where did you finish?
Not second.
No.
No, I was about twenty sixth from the end actually, but
How many?
Twenty sixth.
Wasn't bad, and I finished.
That's good.
That's pretty good
Which is alright
twenty sixth.
considering it was fairly   considering it's pretty er 
Cos only about ten men finished  in front of you or something?
Yes.
Oh no, there were more than that.
I was twenty sixth in the women's, not overall.
Still, that's good.
Oh right.
So I had to put up with the, I had a really shitty cycle  and then, my run was, you know okay 
Well you probably 
for me, but 
you probably tried hardest in your swim didn't you?
Well I don't think I did really, I just  wasn't very sharp really.
I, well I know you have days where you just  you feel alright 
Had you
but then 
prepared alright?
you just go across, not really.
Cos then, the Worlds 
Right.
were only a month before so I sort of war wound down a bit, so 
Yeah.
I mean, I wasn't really feeling, you know when some, sometimes you know you're gonna do really well and sometimes you think, mm mm
Er er  yeah.
not really terribly prepared for 
Pass today.
this one.
And you feel alright but people just go  shh ooh ooh  past you.
That's 
Yeah.
life really.
Just gotta do what you can really haven't you?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna put an extra layer on.
I'm not
That's okay.
gonna
Say, that's alright.
I was just  I wouldn't be bothered anyway.
No you probably wouldn't  actually .
You know me.
Oh God !
What?
In fact, Jon  's 
Yeah.
here.
I haven't seen him for ages.
Well I haven't either.
Whose lager's that?
I mean whose thingie?
It's mine, I was just gonna give it to you.
Is it?
Well in that, actually I'll come and sit on it and then I can fondle Jon's knees while I'm there.
I'm not speaking to you, not with that on.
You don't have to say anything.
Who's got the best knee then?
What?
Oh well erm  different quality of knees really.
You're joking!
Mine's all bone.
That's what I mean, you know, depends 
Bony knees.
depends what turns you on really.
You never know I might be 
Are you sure because erm  when we were away  er James took some photographs
Yeah.
and I saw  just how bony my legs were.
Were in shorts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ooh!
Vegetables!
Ah that's alright.
I got terri I mean, honestly er  I mean people are so 
Well that's a point, speaking of photos  can I have the ones you took at ?
The ones of me.
Please.
I mean, I realize you've probably got them pinned up by your bed, but
Ah, I've made them up into poster size.
Yeah.
Get three D ones made up.
Are you, are you coming to that dinner?
No I'm not.
You're not?
No.
Yeah I know.
Martin won't let me come cos he says it's too expensive.
So, when is it anyway?
Oh probably the  er er  it's worse than I do sometimes.
No, November  the twenty something.
Oh great!
That's very helpful.
Yeah, I dunno why, I sort of oh yes well, I assumed we were going and then he said it was too expensive.
And then, he sort of thought well  funny  sell my body.
I don't know.
I dunno.
It's something like twenty quid each.
That could take me ages to earn.
What d'ya do?
Depending who I'm selling my body to.


I'm a student so I haven't got any money.
But, judging by how crap the Christmas dinner was  I'm not really particularly tempted, but
Tell him you want to go.
That's what we'll do anyway.
Will you dance with me if I come?
What?
Yes.
That means I will.
Yes.
Okay.
As long as it's slow.
Oh, alright then.
Sounds good to me.
You're warned though 
That's worth 
I've got two left feet.
that's worth twenty quid.
That's alright, if you tread on my feet I'll just pick you up and carry you then.
Yeah, that's true.
And put you over my 
 
put you over my shoulder .
You probably could.


A fireman's lift then.
Oh dear.
And we can  disappear outside and everyone'll be talking.
Oh yeah!
Absolutely.


You'll have to deal with Martin though.
Can you run faster than him?
Erm


no, I can't even run for a bus.
Actually probably wouldn't, probably wouldn't be very bothered actually.
I'll just have my bike outside and quickly get on.
I should.
Yeah.
Oh dear.
That erm  Mark  rang up
Oh
rang us up yesterday.
Hello it's Mark from the Tri-Club.
I thought Mark from the Tri-Club, Mark, who the hell is Mark?
Who from the Tri-Club?
Well I didn't even, well he didn't even occur to me actually I must admit.
Excuse me a minute.
But er  going to the loo are we?
Alright then.
Can you bring me a cup of tea back?
One sugar please.
Erm  yeah, so I had this 
 
I had thi yeah I had this long conversation not knowing who the hell he  so I said well are you going, I was thinking Kingfisher, so I thought well, I said are you going training tomorrow night?
He said training?
What training?
I said well, you know, and I thought it could be somebody here  as well.


Let's face it, I made a complete prat of myself.
And then Martin, I sa I still couldn't think who it was.
Martin came home and said oh is that Mark fro Mark from Woking?
I thought,ah, ha !
The wrong bloody number.
Oops!
Yeah.
But honestly, how stupid!
It could, could it not be anybody?
Well I know.
God!
Could have been a  if I didn't know any attractive Marks Tri-Club
Oh, so you di 
so I thought it's a fairly safe bet.
I mean if it ha if somebody had said it was Danny from the Tri-Club I would have had a


I would have been in there, you know.
Oh.
Just on the off chance.
Just on the off chance it was that Danny.
Ha!
I mean, how stupid to ring and say it's Mark.
Yes.
I mean, that's like ringing up and saying it's Jon really isn't it?
But I do ring.
You do ri well we know you well enough to know your voice though.
It's the bear.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Who's that girl?
Yeah, that's Sarah .
She's not as sexy as me is she?

I've never ever been at college after six o'clock, it was very exciting.
 
How old's he?
Six?
Twelve?
How old is he?
A bit young.
I thought you said he was fourteen.
A bit young for me.
Even for me, eh?
Mm.
Even for a little baby like you.
I know.
The youngest, the youngest below me I've ever gone for is three years younger.
Well that was  that was fairly excessive.
And that was when you were six.
God he was sexy!
No, it was when about 
 
about  seventeen  and he was  fourteen.
God he was fabulous!
The best kisser I've ever met.
What do you mean?

I can't cope.
Yeah I, I know how you feel mine's  mine's .
Do you have write-ups and lots of work ?
Oh oh!
They're not like that all the time.
It's just been a bit of a surge once a month.

Once a month .


Hero!
What time's this matey turning up?

Or have you got it already?
No, we gotta go down to Kingfisher and get it.
We're gonna be late home.
We're gonna be late home.
Mm mm.
Did she tell you what her luxury was while you were away?
Sitting up painting her nails at midnight, in bed.
She said it was just wonderful not having anybody shouting at her to turn the light off.
Mm mm.
Oh dear.
I said my luxury when Martin was out was eating half a very large cream cake.
And ho drinking half a bottle of wine.
We didn't quite decide which was more the .
Kitty, what are you doing Sunday?
Are you gonna go into London?
What do you want me to do then?
Good question.
What?
Are you with Martin?
Eleven o'clock.
Probably.
If it involved marshalling, definitely.
Well you can stand up.
Are you waiting?
Yeah.
Well you
I've gotta stand up just now.

Ooh!
Ooh ooh ooh !
Oh that's good .
It was a thingie reaction 
Yeah.
isn't it?
Reflex.
Yeah .
If I sit here, if I sit very still he'll forget about me.
He'll come this way in a minute.
Have you ever had that done it's so  bizarre, I tell you.
What, being kicked in the bollocks or  no reflexes?
Yes.
been kicked in, in the bollocks.
You get it done when you go to the doctors don't you?
Yeah.
It's bizarre cos it's like  you haven't got control.


You feel like a puppet .
Oh blimey!
Do you think I might just find anybody here who'd like a really good snog?
Not with that cold, no.
Well it's not infectious any more.
Well I would love to.
I think Martin might get a bit upset.
Well he doesn't wanna bloody snog!
He's off kissing.
He doesn't like kissing, he noticed that after two years.
I don't really like kissing very much.
Oh for God's sake!
Now you tell me!
Sex is so much better.
Ah?
Eh?
Swallow, swallow.


No it's not!
It is.
Not if you try hard.
Vastly overrated I'm afraid.
Yeah?
Mm?
It's vastly overrated.
And it's hard just to get  all the way up.
Yeah.
Oh yeah?
What are we
Yeah, the .
Come on then.
He's not looking.
It was the only time I've worn four layers on the top  in a race.
Yeah.
And it was the full kit, you know.
It was 
Oh yeah.

Mind you, that's what they all say though.
Yeah?
Are you cold?
Are you wanting me to warm you up ?
Want my jumper?
Mm?
Do you want my jumper?
Haven't you got your  ?
Tt!
Oh!
I'm really cold.
Still   I'll survive.
I know.


I'll warm you up.
There's still something there yo there's still something there you can't be that cold.
Go on.
Do your natural duties.
Gosh!
Ha!
The end of the Worlds, you know how cold it was there, and we were all going down the finish tunnel  you just, all of the blokes you just thought
There's only three of the blokes .
there's nothing there!
It's gone!
It's gone!
Well  
There's only fifteen altogether .
Not that, not that I look at that sort of thing on a regular basis so
They go  
Well when they're just standing there in a vest and shorts then there isn't much else to look at is there, really?
Yeah.
Then yo 
It was Saturday or Sunday?
What?
Are you
Twenty fourth.
Twenty fourth, is it?
Well that's why Doug's going round asking about Sunday is it?
If you are going it's best to 
Where is it?
Women in, she's gonna win women's categories.
Where is it and what is it?
Isn't there one in November or something?
You're shivering!
Is that just cos you've got your leg like that or is the other one shaking?
Sorry, that one's shaking cos you've got it tucked up, cos I'm touching you isn't it?
Yeah.
A bit 
Eh?
excited.
You like coming along here don't you?
I do.
What's this?
I like touching Jon's leg.
Yes.
Are you recording?
Don't!
Get off!
She's taping it all.
Yeah, I'm doing a local project.
 
But so far we've had erm, we've had  who likes kissing and who doesn't.
Sex is better with Jon cos he does it better.


And I'm a nymphomaniac.
It sounded quite good to me.
All good clean stuff.
I know.
I've gotta hand it in on Friday so I'm getting a bit desperate.


Better not mention I shave my legs on
 
Oh no!
on Monday.
Yesterday .
Yes, the kinkier the better really, you know.
I'd like to know where you're supposed to stop.
What d'ya mean?
Which particular section of the conversation are we talking about?


Dunno.
Where you're supposed to stop 
Jon 
shaving your legs up to.
Oh right.
Jon obviously doesn't know where to stop.
It's painful.
If he's that good.
You should u use Immac it's less painful.
Sorry?
Use Immac it's less painful.
Immac?
For your legs.
Immac?
Evil smelling pink stuff that you put all over your legs and 
Wax?
leave it.
No, no, no.
And then you leave it 
 Nitromorse for legs.
then you leave it for erm


five minutes and then all your hairs drop out and then you, then you just wipe them off.
It's great.
I'd be a  
It's quite a good chat up line.
Get a girl to do it for you.
Yeah.
I, I've often had that fantasy actually.


I think most girls have a fantasy about waxing some blokes legs.
.
Oh!
Ooh er!
Baby!
Martin has his waxed.
He was very brave.
No one would wax mine.
Really?
Not many places will wax men's legs.
I dunno why, but in a way
Yeah, Gill can do it.
The sports centre'll do it.
It's yours.
You're making me feel really guilty.
Stop it!
I'll be afraid that they can see my tummy.
No!
You can't, you can't see, you can't  you could cover your legs with it though 
A bit.
couldn't you?
Yes, well keep your pants on, that's all I can say.
 
What are you doing?


What did you say you were doing Sunday?
I thought you might have forgotten about me Doug.
No.
I don't know.
What am I doing?
Has Martin said what I'm doing already?
And where is it?
No, well Martin looked through the diary.
Where is it?

Oh I see.
I thought she was 
Yeah.

Can you not er  bring her along afterwards?
 
She'll be really chuffed .
Erm, I don't know what I'm doing actually.
That's very helpful of me isn't it?
I shall ask Martin 
How's it going Doug?
when it gets a bit nearer.
Pardon?
How's it going?
Well, it's not very good actually.
But I still have to put some of the blinds out again.
What happened to the one I did last year?
The last time I did  you put me on blind bends.
Did I?
And then said afterwards, I put you there cos they stop for women and not men.
So I

Stop!

At least I wasn't wearing a stilettos.
True.

Oh yes .
Dear Doug


Don't forget to untie the dog.
And you can just imagine him rid 
You can.
driving away with it
Absolutely.
Woof!
Nicely  then followed the car.
Yeah, true.
It's easy.
I don't .
But then you start to overtake him   seventy miles an hour or so.
Dog's yapping.
