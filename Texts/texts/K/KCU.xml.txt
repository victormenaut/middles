Cos you don't start right next to those  don't go straight across the racecourse.
 
Right here we go then!
that way don't you?
Stop the chit-chat!
Let's go for it!
Seven.
Don't forget it's, no cos it's a .
Gift from dad, collect a hundred pound.
What do you say?
Oh you big head!
I missed that!
What did you say ?
Oh hold on!
What are we gonna 
Don't forget it's 
do?
You gotta go round 
Two 
once!
you gotta earn two  things  and 
Yeah?
five thousand pound and either a  the diploma or a membership.
That's right!
Before you can go up.
Yeah.
That's right!
And then 
Unless you land 
five 
on  that.
Unless you land on
So it's five thousand 
 
and two for that one, and ten thousand and two for that one.
What are we setting the  end for?
Fifty thousand?
Well it says the No!
No , cos you only have to go round five times don't you?
Ten thousand.
Don't matter!
You do it as you says don't you?
Unless you set a time or something.
Cos then go 
It can't be ten, I mean you collect ten thousand as you 
Every time you go round, so that's five times round.
 
Yeah, but that's why we done it though weren't it?
Or didn't you wanna do it like that?
I don't mind!
Cos you gotta set a target now before
Yeah.
Well we've only got 
we start.
one thousand anyway!
Two thousand.
Yeah, you need five thousand to get up into there.
Aha.
And then you need ten thousand to get from there to there.
So, twenty thousand.

No!
Cos you only have to go round twice cos you collect ten thousand when you pass there!
And  
Say twenty thousand!
That's ten times round innit?
Up to you!

A long weekend
Yes a long weekend
Yeah, cos you'll want, you'll want 
You'll only need Monday night off won't you?
We're going, we're going on a Friday 
You'll only need the 
Sunday night
Sunday night off
we're going on the Friday and coming back on 
And the Monday especially if we're travelling back on the Monday
we're going on the Friday morning and coming back on this
No we can't go the Friday morning
Oh no
because of the kids
we'll go on the afternoon
because everybody else will be working 
and we're, we're going on the Friday afternoon and coming back on the Monday afternoon.
Yeah, so really driving back all that way you want Monday night off as well, you'll be knackered 
Take Monday , take Fri take Monday off as well 
Take Sunday and Monday off?
cos what we'll do we'll go out for a meal in the evening
if we've got the money
Why don't we just go to Keith's and let him do something?
Cos they always cook for us anyway
No, eat out somewhere I think
Please yourself, we'll go with Terry and Kath
just B and B, no, well Dot'll probably
down there, you know what she's like
Yeah, that's what I mean
Well if not, we'll go, eat out somewhere, it's just as cheap innit?
Well we won't have to go to 
Look how much it cost us to go to that bloody restaurant with Chris and Keith
Yeah but look how far that
not Chris and Keith, Chris and Dot
Yeah it was
Keith, Chris and Dot, no Keith didn't go, you me, your dad
Oh that's right
Chris and Dot 
She'll be alright if I come 
it was only about a mile down the road that place
How far?
through the sticks, right what do you do with this game then?
Dunno, you don't win nothing
Yes you do
You don't wanna go, you don't wanna go October do you?
If your aunt asks you 
To play shuffle the cards and place face down in the centre of the 
No cos 
playing surface 
it closes in October don't it?
Cos we went there 
Do you know 
the last week in September and it was the last week it was open, so you're better of going near the middle or I mean the beginning or 
all we've got to do is phone 
the middle of September
we'll phone Chris and Keith and ask them the best time for us to go when the kids are not there, and she'll tell us 
When do the kids , the kids go back to school the first week so if you go 
First week in September 
the second week in September
Yeah, well you check on that, but I think that'll be okay won't it?
cos that's when we went weren't it?
Second week
Yeah
What do you, what do you do here then?
Cards have got to go face down on the table 
Yeah, shuffle , I read that,decide who goes first, the rest following in succ er whatever,start playing in a clockwise direction 
You've gotta read one of the two questions on it and there's like
the player takes the first card and looks at it, if it is a question card ask the next player, one of the two questions  
Oh shit, they're, they're all together now 
if the card is the instruction card, do you know what happens if you don't get it right then?
Yeah, it just goes to the bottom of the pack, but erm there's numbers up there, you've gotta collect them to spell out sex maniac
Mm, mm
so you've got to keep hold of that 
Whoever spells out sex maniac, but if you have more than nine, every card 
Ah so it's the first person who spells sex maniac
Yeah
easy innit?
every time you get a question right you pick a card, but if you have more than, once you've got more than nine cards you've got to put one at the bottom of the pack again
Yeah, but you keep them all tidy won't you?
Yeah, I'm just trying to shuffle them to keep them together
