Yeah.
It's .
Oh, Gail.
Sorry.
You were supposed to have told me.

He got three things, oh a pastry things
Oh yeah.
That was one twenty five and I give him .

And .
It's all like for little kids, younger kids.
Like Daniel?

What sort of age three or  .
Did yeah?
Right I suppose I've better got to do some housework Gail.
Yeah, got to .
They .
How much were these Gail?
Sixteen ninety five.
They're alright  They look alright.
Alright, aren't they?
Yeah..
Not really.
the same.
If I put hers 
Tell you how to do, see, right Gail?
It's an hour .
Put her foot on it when she comes in , that's her school bus, bus thirteen, do they fit her?
Do they fit her?
Yeah  only just, that's .
When she comes in keep this out right?
Yeah.
And when she comes in, what's that one, put her left foot on it, right?
Yeah.
And if, if her foot overlaps it all, take them back, cos you might be better off just getting two anyway
Yeah.
cos Scott's, Scott's in a two football boot, there  sort of thing innit?
Yeah.
She's gonna wear her thick socks with them,dangling  aren't they?
Yeah.
That's what I'd be inclined to do   so
on top of the telly, and say just put your foot on here a minute, now, they look quite thin now, but, that's what I was looking at, yeah, cos her feet are fat, yeah, but they, that do like that don't they?
Yeah, that, yeah ,spreads out to the side anyway, don't it?
Yeah, put these .
Try her foot on it and if it don't, if her foot overlaps
Yeah.
then take them back up and get a two.
Cos the thing is as well, I might be inclined to get a two anyway, because she wants it to last a little while don't she?
Anyway , yeah.
They're not gonna last very long not a  like that is it?
Is that how it was?
Yeah.
That was quick .
Yeah .
Yeah.
I'm not going to do no housework today.
, see mum and dad on Saturday at .
Yeah..
If erm
Go on.
if her foot's wide, wider than that would it matter?
Well yeah, cos it ought to be tight on her, across.
But if her foot's wider, you'll get the bigger size it'll take it up on the length bit.
Yeah.
So I'd be more inclined, let me have a look at her when she comes in, send her up.
Yeah 
see, is it, I mean sometimes Scott's foot too wide for a  both sides.
Mm.
Yeah   their trainers upstairs  they still, they fit alright.
Yeah.
They're not tight, that's why I went for a one cos I thought it's like a trainer innit?
Yeah  yeah 
You look quite a way .
Only other thing I can you do is try it on when she's asleep.
That's what I do with his football boots I bought him,.
I, I  looking at them .
Yeah.
They look big enough don't they?
Yeah 
Yeah, alright then.

Innit though, that you people all a fucking .
.
, do you know what we spent, listen, listen, mummy do this, we spent a Christmas in Hungary right, their Christmases right, Christmas Eve the snowplough is out on the road clearing the snow, it was that deep, it was up in 
Oh that's nice.
and it was windy right, he got a tree a third of the height of that on a table, they puts it up on a table, and underneath the tree they have got one present which is member of the family from each member of the family, right, that is it, one present, it maybe a box of chocolates, you know, or a box of cigars, something like that, children wake up Christmas morning they have a bag which is about that big, with a  full of sweets and bits and pieces, little toy car thing and they have one big present, right, and I'll tell you what festivity over there is as well, that  must , it  because it's not over dark because there no big glory about it, there so much more relaxed that, well Chris he said, yeah
.
Yeah .
Oh Dummy popped, popped 
Too much now in it?.
Chris he
It's competition.
it's, the festivities gone from this, all it is, is an excuse to drink in it?
Yeah, yeah but you've just been  and then for us now, cos we're the parents it's a bag of shit in it Christmas?
Yeah.
But for the kid, this way
Yeah, but who .
.
Yeah but would they, what I mean is that there are even for the parents
What, I suppose every  comes along I want that .
Yeah.
It's so relaxed
Oh.
Yeah
It's so, I mean, wake up Christmas morning and they put a tray out, the first thing they do on, the last thing at night, Christmas Eve they put a big tray out and on the tray they got it's a  called  and they're like chocolate biscuits, they're like biscuits, right, and that gets  with every member of the house, say there's ten in that house, that  that gets lined round the outside of the tray, right, and then inside of that'll be now a circle of the wine, and then they have like whatever drink they got in the middle and the first thing that happens Christmas Eve morning is they get up and that gets poured and the tray goes round, if you sit down 
 
 
.
and the tray, that's it though, that is it actual Christmas drink that goes round the room and then the presents come out  I look out the window and the snow blow
Yeah.
and  it's sort of gone in five minutes .
Yeah,gets up bloody in the middle of the night.
We got up at eight and I
Well she need 
Yeah our Chris was up, our Chris was up, woke up about five o'clock and .
Well Nat woke up at, half past one, she was awake then all night she kept coming in
Oh 
Jesus Christ
Oh God 
right
putting my lot .
and then er, so by half past four I just about had enough like, so five o'clock I said well for Christ sake come on open your stocking now like and waking Arthur up and he saying well I ain't , and I said come on it's five o'clock, alright, and by six o'clock we're downstairs, half past six the door
I wish I could be like it, cos I'm so unorganised Christmas morning, by five o'clock I'm not even dressed.
Well then by half past ten, ten o'clock I'm down   and then Nat, Nat sees her  
And then I  all morning  have me dinner, Arf's done the dinner and  have me Christmas dinner and then go to sleep all afternoon .
Well we don't, we usually erm have a about an hour goes to sleep for an hour .

I wouldn't like that, that seems terrible.
Mind I wouldn't mind that  quarter past eight.
I haven't got to wake her up all morning, but Christmas Eve
No, no, they don't usually wake .
I think because they don't go off to sleep so early, it's so late there going off  erm.
I thought our Charlie was getting our .
Oh I don't put it up there, I don't even put it up.
I don't know if I'm going to do it this year cos this year she's chosen, I've got four, right there's two the same which she usually has up those, like she'll hang one up, fill one up and swop them over
Oh
this year she chose a big one like I got for Arf last year, cos I ain't got a double of that so I'm going to have to tape it off, fill it up and then put it back on  cos  in case she opens mine.

Your, your mind is sort of like working overtime all the time innit, thinking Christ what else have I got to get, is there anything I've forgotten, that's what I don't like.

Twenty 
tree, show you the Christmas tree .
.
Oh Charlie shut her up at, at Chris's mums funeral, when we went to Chris's mum funeral, she's erm, she said something or other about, request something or other about, pointing at the  I shouldn't've been there really because I didn't know her and Charlie said she felt  didn't know her and erm she said oh well Rose never spoke about her, or words to that effect, Chris says the reason our mum never spoke about her cos she never showed her face in here anyway, he said when was the last time you see your mum, at that, she shut straight up like that, her face went, she'd like saying that I shouldn't've been there cos I didn't know her, I mean yet, she ain't set foot in the house for fucking year like, you know  she's a horrible cow, and like when we went in the church, when we went in the crematorium er you had, she had a nice, big one up on the hill is it Arnold's?
Yeah.
and we went in and like the vicar greets you at the door don't he and she was like  up to the vicar like, you know, she's more fucking heavier than thou
.
there she 
.
.
she had 
.
As I remembered old nag, and he had his wife with her, you know,really do, if there's one people I  if there's  people in this world that I hate, it's got to be the religion
Yeah.
.
Does anybody knock your doors Sunday, Saturday?
Ah Jehovah Witnesses weren't it,.
I thought they were Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses
Was it Jehovah Witnesses or Mormons?
Mormons.
Mormons.
Mormons.
Jehovah Witnesses,
.
They just don't shut up do they.
What  erm
I've seen them wandering around, this is when I'm out shopping I find out  .
He's just like  , you know, they say .
Isn't there any sort of erm church or anything like that, I'm sure there's one over there, is, do you know anybody round here that's sort of religious  .
.
Brrrm.
We usually pick, most of them keep their religion to themselves don't they for me I wouldn't know .
Yeah, I don't know , I don't, I think religion's gone out the door to be honest with you, I don't think any religion with anyone really, erm, and is important in life that is used today, no, bloody don't, I .
Do you .
But they do nothing do they?
It's just another way of er  .
I think the only people, right, the only people that go to church is the religious people or ones that have something to feel shameful about.
They go because they need to cover some sort of guilt, I'm convinced of that now, the more people that I know I mean fib of all people fib is now turned to religion .
Oops you've dropped it , no, that way now Dan that way.

She's not like thirty four weeks and the baby's only twenty six and she's got to stay in for a week at Southwood, then come home weekends and go back in.
Oh,.
Yeah, yeah and she's, yeah, and she says she's so fed cos to her there's nothing wrong with her , the baby did put on weight last week, but she said you know, what do you do in here all day .
They did that with me with Hannah, right, they, when er, she had B P P done, what they call a B P P, when they do a prick  of the baby
Oh I don't know, she's had stuff taken from the placenta and all that's as well, yeah .
That's it, that's what I had they told  and they said that it might be that she's just, she's just is small for her size, but it might be that Katie taken all the goodness from Hannah
Yeah.
and erm, I mean they  I mean they were born 
Good God, they reckon hers is gonna be three and a half to four pounds.
.
Yeah, yeah.
.
Five.
.
Yeah.
Course she's worried, cos like she smokes a lot and she's say what thirty and that's her first, and they keep going on to her all the time like, I said well don't worry about it, you know.
she does feel guilty perhaps she can just try and cut down a bit now.
Well she has, she has, yeah, she's gone from twenty to five.
Well
And it is five, do you know what I mean it is like what I used to say to Rose .
.
,.
I mean Adam's lucky in that respect, I couldn't smoke when I was pregnant, I, it made me feel sick, I couldn't stand the smell of it, I had no urge to smoke at all, I went right off smoking, I  respect, I was lucky, but I do feel sorry for these people that smoking at present cos it must be ever so hard.
Yeah, I didn't smoke for the first six months and then I finished work and I was at home
And you got bored.
yeah, and I used to go round and see our Trace every day, and she was still smoking
.
and er, so I used to, I started again and then I didn't smoke until I come out of ho , when I come out, I didn't smoke
Mm.
for about a month, six weeks, cos I had so much on me mind 
.
yeah, there's only three weeks between Nat and Neill
Yeah, she's .
yeah, yeah
.
Neill, he was seven pound odd  so it makes you feel, sometime you think that makes you think well, it didn't affect, you know,
No.
but there again everybody's different aren't they?
I think they have got a point, I think it might, it might ,
Yeah , yeah.
have some effect on the baby.
Well it's got to I think we've, look what it's doing to yourself
Yeah, I think it must have some effect there 
And seeing you've got another life inside you , it must be doing something to them mustn't it?
It's bound to harm, I mean I know what you said when he had all that problem, he sort of said reckon cos I smoke.
You know I think you always bring the blame back don't you?
Yeah.
That's .
Yeah.
I mean if your child was born with one arm you'll still fucking blame yourself for it wouldn't you at the end of the day.
Yeah , yeah 
It must be difficult, like I said I was lucky in the respect that I had, it never ever appealed to, to  the minute I got pregnant, from the minute .
Yeah.
.
I, I had to really stop meself.
That really turned my stomach, even if, I mean I remember when I was carrying, when I was carrying the twins,and he used to go out  huge things you know,and so much so that if he came home in the night, right, and I was already in bed asleep, I would be able to er, he would wake me in the bedroom cos I could smell smoke on him, but he didn't smoke, but where he'd been the pub or a night club, I smelt
In the pub, yeah .
He smokes now though didn't he?
yeah,and I would make him there and then no matter what time of night or morning it was, strip off and go in the shower and , yeah, even in his hair, that's, that's how bad it was, I'd put his clothes downstairs in the washing basket not even in the bedroom one .
I mean it was, it kept me awake  it didn't matter how .
You were together when you moved in though weren't you? cos I remember you moving in like thinking cor look at her with three kids , yeah.
Yeah, we were, ah erm, we were together when we actually met, it was sort of on and off really .

Yeah what's er name flunter?
I don't know what 
What it is, it was a duke When our Scott I had it.

With the case.
Oh  well that'll do.
And all that.
Well you better have a flunter with them, number five.
Twenty six  so that's a bit heavier so that'll probably be better.

So you get all that.
I'm not keen on the blobby bit at the end though.
What there?
