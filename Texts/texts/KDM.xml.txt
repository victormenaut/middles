Don't forget
I said it's not for us anyway so
it's going to take a lot of fabric  both sides and the back.
Full length of the back of the chairs  across the seat  
Exactly.
probably be    yards of material that, and you've got six chairs so  And you'd have to buy it off the roll, you're not going to get a piece  a length at six yards are you?
You know  
Where's your cup?
That's mine there, I've got mine out.
Oh 
In the bathroom.
Sun's trying to come out.

Must be the leaves I think  because I don't think it flowers this   shrub here.
It's the leaves.

That dogwood I moved  I'm hoping it's gonna be alright cos  it doesn't s show much sign of life at the moment.
Oh I put it down the other end.
Oh.
I wonder did Ann stop smoking yesterday?
Mm.

Oh god, there's snow.
Mm  well we haven't seen any this year have we really?
Too late now.
Yeah too late to be serious  
I was wrapped up to the eyes when I went u down to   put my walking boots on as well because they're comfortable  and there were people going  going round in their shellsuits and  you know  I must be feeling the cold more now .
I don't think I'd have been warm enough in a shellsuit.

It's  birthday.
I mean the only trouble is they're no use afterwards are they?
Must have had a brainstorm  
I said they're no use afterwards are they?
I don't  I don't know.
Because they're forced I reckon.
Oh.
I think they'll grow if you put them in the garden  eventually.

Not much of a job  when it came to put them on like the erm  you know the pipe that pushes them out?
Yeah, yeah 
You've gotta push them back haven't you?
And you've usually got

too much fluid in
yeah
Well it says in the book, push them back with  a stick .
With a what?
With a stick and a piece of 
Yeah 
Well if it's frozen there's no way  so er I rang up Mobil you see in  and the fellow said oh if it's been on for s you know  few years he said, take your calliper off, put it in the vice and just lever it back  that's what we do
Yeah.
Goes to get the flexible hose off  that was ruddy frozen, you the, the union?
Yeah, yeah
Rang him up again he said oh aye well we usually change those he said, the weather gets on them.
Said they're not like the old ones that go like  as though they're welded
Yeah.
and you're turning the whole pipe.
He said the only, the other thing you can do is  loosen it off  take the calliper b and turn the calliper round.
Yeah.
It's like turning the car round to take off a bloody  bolt, you know?
Oh I thought I'll do that to save another hose.
Anyway did that  course he said you'll have to bleed it out 
Yeah.
Did the first one  right  this was on er  Wednesday  afternoon you see?
So came to do the other side, went to the same routine  the nipple snapped off.
So any rate I rang this fellow   I said eh he said  oh he said you've got no chance mate, he said.
He said you can drill it out but he said you  oh aye your  the thread gets damaged  and the seating
That's right, yeah.
and he said if you get one leak on that your brakes
Yeah.
you're shot.
So a new calliper  how much do you think for a new calliper?
No idea.
Seventy pound plus VAT from Volvo's.
Bloody hell!
So I thought there's no way, so I rang round the scrapyards.
Yeah.
There's one at Greenville he said oh twenty five pound plus VAT.
That's what I did, yesterday morning went with my mate  came back, stuck it on  so it's cost me  the, the pads were seventeen  twenty, thirty pound for the what's a name and  fifty quid near enough just to do the front brakes.
Bloody hell.
And that's before the M O T.
Yeah  yeah.
The other week it cost me fifty quid to go to the, to get it tuned you know?
Cars, honest to god.
You want some money today don't you, just to ruddy  eh?

These other ones, as soon as you leave  do it yourself  that's another twenty quid for a re-test 
Yeah.
Oh aye.
You do it there they only charge  fifteen is it or something if they do it.
But I mean you know as you just said then they'd wanna charge you per hour it's

Oh 
Well I, I wanted just a small box like what you made.
Wasn't satisfied with it, he goes and makes a big one as well but I don't want a big one, I don't wanna do a big one  for the sale I just wanna do a small one.
Ah well he's always wanted a big one.
Yes
And er   and a stool with a  seat to match, that's all I wanted.
Mm.
That's typical

Chairs we're doing today.
There's six of those to do, now then.
Yeah  put them in the sale, you know  I'm gonna put them in the sale  see if we can get a few bob  right, pattern first I should imagine.
many people coming to the sales.
I won't let you 
I've only put, I've put stuff in.
Yeah.
You know but
I er never actually
I, I  I made about sixty quid last year, you know?
Oh yes I believe  it gets er quite a lot, it's er  well yesterday there weren't many for that open day.
But for the sale er  it's well advertised you know and er there's a lot of people seem to know about it, you know connected with the college mainly I suppose, they get their mates to come  ooh there's good stuff  and there is some good stuff, you know?
Yeah.
So it's er it seems to do pretty well.
I'll er I'll try to get a few things, make a few bob you know, to 
don't mind me asking, what would you expect to ?
Don't know yet.
Well I'm hoping a hundred plus 
 
you know?
Yeah.
Well christ you've gotta be, I've paid that to be honest
Yeah
I've paid seventy for the bloody things.
Yeah.
Erm  I dunno 
Oh they're nice chairs  
hundred and thirty maybe I'm not, I'm not quite sure to be honest er  not quite sure old mate.
Yeah I'll see what they say, you know, erm I'll  John, he had a set of erm  high backed  reproduction erm  what do they call them now?
Regency  nineteen twenties,in the twenties 
Yeah 
out of mahogany.
They are nice though, they've got the Queen Anne legs and the high back you know?
Yeah.
He got about er two hundred for those last year, set of six.
You know he just bought them from  sale or whatever it was, sixty, seventy quid  bit of polish.
They were  not mistaken.
Did, he did well.
Some of them have a lot of stuff, you know I don't seem to ever get hold of the stuff me, to  tables and that  little Eric in there he seems to get loads of stuff  
Yeah I can't 
he's got a lovely table there hasn't he?it's a nice one.
He's got a lot of connections Eric, you know and
I have very few I'm afraid.
There you go.
Thank you.
and I think that's why we've got such a good dentist.
Mm 
and he erm  he was very upset about it.
Then he  by that time this expensive  and that's the one that's .
So he said   start again.
You're still paying out that's the trouble, all the time.
Well that's it.
But on the other hand, what can you do about it?
You can't  
No, no it's oh no you can't go round gummy.
We're going to, we've, we've got this  going down to  for three weeks, you know next weekend  or the weekend afterwards, and we don't keep getting appointments, see I'm gonna keep ringing him up and pestering him and saying 
Mm 
have you got a cancellation?
It's life isn't Ray?
Oh yeah.
I mean 
I mean what
friend of ours, he, he hit his tooth, got a lovely tooth  Ken he's sixty one now, never had much trouble you know
Snapped this one off  er you know in an ac he fell over or whatever, on his  
Yeah, that's right.
said oh god  he didn't know whether to pull it out there and then
But it's  very hard  
But  went to the dentist and he said leave it  pushed it right back and he said it will grow back.
Did it?
Oh yes.
Ah it must 
Long as the roots are 
Oh well yes, oh well yeah, oh well now obviously 
So er   
I mean my boy had a er a terrible accident ten years ago and smashed all his face  all his teeth were   when we first saw his face he'd got no teeth left  but it's  got them all back.
And they're all back and  yeah even though they were all, they were all loose  I mean  still fresh you see the, the break.
And it's, the life is in the, still in the tooth if you can find it, but of course sometimes they've gone haven't they?
Too late for us  
Put up with what we've got eh?
What?
Put up with what we've got.
Well as I say I look after mine but I've only got  the one missing.
Mm  I'd hate to have a load of chop  ooh 
was scared  only children  he was scared wasn't he?
Tony was frightened.
Oh yes that's stupid that, he he'll end up  if he doesn't go, with a mou a mouth of  sort of black 
He, he'll have them all out.
Yes.
If he  we used to   the children 
I think that's awful if young people 
even our grandchildren were, I mean er right from the beginning even if they only go and sit in the surgery  and just watch,ju you know just go and visit 
Yeah that's, that's what they do now yeah.
Get them trained, get them  
Yes, yeah so they're not terrified.
That's right, I mean  there's no pain  
I think they were frightening years ago when they, when we were kids so they're frightening places.
Well we had no, we had no erm  nothing to stop the pain.
No.
We had no injections, we were just put in a chair and, and it cost 
That's right 
two guineas for every filling  
I know, it's a lot of money.
I mean 
Yeah, week's wages yeah.
But we, he didn't get more than two or three guineas a week did he when we were first 
That's right, yeah yes
Then we get, I know  our dentist was very good, we've always said that if we had a good dentist and a good doctors we're on our holidays, and we have, we've been lucky wherever we've been
Mm.
Mm.
we've had good dentists, good doctors.
Oh it pays you to get a sympathetic one and one that's er not on the 
But this one is lovely.
This one's  young and he's so gentle, you know he 
Yes.
Oh they're marvellous.
I think that's what Tony's harking back to, the old style when you went and they were a bit er callous.
Yes indeed well,young, how old is he?
Twenty  five?
He's only in his twenties, yeah he ought not, no it wouldn't be would it?
No.
Twenty years ago they were, they were alright weren't they?
What am I thinking about?
No I'm thinking about 
  

Well you know the first time I went was  oh I dunno, before the war you know when I was about four or five and I went to get one out  I mean my parents
but it was terrible I was screaming, I was terrified and, and, and I can still see the place you know, there's something very foreboding about the, the place and the chair was like a
And everything was hard 
 
wasn't it?
And they wouldn't mess about if you, you  they slapped you if you didn't do as you were told.
So that put me right off for a start.
But erm  you only get one good set don't you?
That's right.
I  
And also you see right from, right from pregnancy  
 
Well they get it free don't they?
At the moment.
yeah.
I mean er it's before they're  conceived that you've got to try to 
Oh yes, yes.
I mean it's no good  smoking yourself to death and then er
That's right.
falling for a baby and then saying 
No no 
oh dear
Well that makes me ill now.
It didn't used to but when I, I, I, I feel like going up to these girls and saying for god's sake take that thing out of your mouth.
That's right.
When they're pregnant or they've got a little baby.
It's horrible.
I mean  
But you know you can't tell people.
This friend of ours who lost his wife last year, well we've got another friend who was very fond of her  she also smokes  we just happened to me we didn't say
No.
I mean it's happened now so we never 
Absolutely.
No you can't.
say to th this chap you know but  we just happened to mention in passing to Jeanette  and she really jumped and said oh Pat didn't smoke a lot.
But
Was it very sudden?
we know via my daughter  she's a nurse and she said no  cancer  get a lot of uterine cancer and all this it's not, not in the lungs now.
Forget that.
That's obvious.
But all the other things
That's right.
it goes to.
But  you can't tell these people.
They won't listen.
This lady we're on about now she's  she must be on forty, fifty a day.
A nervous smoker.
See how does she afford it?
Well that's right, they're both of them at it.

Yes.
but it is round the back I know 
Yeah, never be seen will it?
I can't say
three brass things, no it shouldn't be seen really, so I don't know whether I'm drawing attention to it by putting brass things  
Yes that's the thing, of course.
I s 
Cos it's got a handle on it now at the front  here round the other side
Yes I'm gonna do mine something like this I think.
Have you er  it is sprung is it?
Pardon?
Sprung?
Yes.
Ooh   
did it, they 
Dear god.
Bloody he 
It didn't actually have a handle on it.
Just put one on it  
Yeah 
yeah  well you could have a bit of  material couldn't you?
Yeah.
Looks a bit rough.
Yeah    Bloody hell!
This webbing now is that alright love?
Yes.
Now you've, your material didn't go the other way on that  these chairs did they, before you 
No 
put the webbing on?
Yes  
it just goes on to the edge here.
Oh yes.
I 
going to hide the back, all that webbing?
Oh no  oh no wait a minute, no 
Yeah, you realize do you  it's what it, what's wrong.
The, the fro the top cover should have gone on first should it?
Material  gone on first.
Oh yes 
procedure for any tackle, if you haven't got any the cover must go that way.
oh I, I'd never, I I realize now from six weeks ago when I got the damn things
Yeah.
and it's gone blank.
Of course the top material's gotta go on first Joan hasn't it?
Yes.
What am I?
Mm.
Yeah.
Star pupil for doing such silly things .
So really I'm stymied on that aren't I?
What I'll do today 
Yeah you'll have to take those er those off and machine them all together.
You can use them on something else.
Yeah well that's no problem.
What I'll do, I'll measure up today for er 
Yeah 
the top material  work out a plan for how much I'll want.
How much you need.
I'll try and get through the  neutrally.
I dunno
Yeah, how many have, have you got?
Six.
Six?
Cos I might be putting a table in the sale  on its own  but it's a it's dark 
Oh 
i it's darker than that.
oh.
Yeah.
Well actually it's mahogany, it's brown mahogany.
Oh, oh, oh.
That's no good.
Whether, you know, people might have bought them as a set otherwise.
Yeah, yeah that's what it wants, someone with big turned legs 
W yeah, some, some  yeah 
on the table.
You see them don't you?
Oh well 
Oh have you?
Oh you're doing a good job there John.
How many did you say 
today.
What are these?
Two?
No it's four.
Oh four, oh it's a set is it?
Nice.
Is it  keeping these are you or ?
For now.
I'm really 
Yeah 
after a set of six.
Ah, oh well yeah er 
But rea what I really want, is a set of six  barley twist.
I mean it's gonna take me ages trying to find them anyway.
But I've got a barley twist table.
Ah you see them yeah, yeah table and you want them to match in 
gonna make it er two eventually
Yes, yes
but these will do, four of these will do temporary anyway 
Yeah, nice.
but I want a set of six in the end.
I mean how often do you use six?
Well we do, there's five of us in the family see  
Oh I see 
Yeah so
we had four kids   I mean now it's only when we get visitors you know when
Yeah.
there's only two of us, you get two visitors we're alright as a four
Saying that we don't 
We keep ours in the garage, the extra  two carvers
Oh yes.
and they come down when you know, if we've got any
When you need them.
Mm.
Otherwise it's just a waste really.
Well that's probably what I'm gonna have to do.
You can get, you can get sets of four can't you?
Oh yes 
But six  hard to get.
I'll just try and get two carvers to match 
Yeah, that's, that's the answer really and er if they're not quite the same you can get away with two carvers can't you?
But er  oh well  Yeah this is what got me, I like the er the legs you know, the the backs I, I didn't like at all because you've got this blue  
Well 
You've got no  no m no wood that's showing you see, that's the trouble.
Yes, yes.
Yeah
Erm but I'm hoping they'll  put them on a, on the table when we sell them in here and there's  that's the first thing that'll hit them is the turned legs you see?
Nice.
This is a su survey.
finished at one point but it's veneered
Mm
But erm
this, but this was exposed then?
The material 
That, it's down to there, yes
Oh that's a shame.
but this had been put on so it, it spoilt
Oh I see.
Yeah, yes so 
you know you'd got veneer and then you'd got really crappy wood.
The pine and that, yes.
But also people had put nails in the veneer and bits had fallen off and
Ruined it, yeah.
there wasn't any point in me trying 
Felt like a bit of challenge there.
Well you know me  nothing 
 
if there's any woodworking going  
Is this today is it?
Yes.
Too late now.
Yes, but you went last week so I didn't  but they'd got stuff for you 
Oh I  I thought I had loads of 
Oh Ray!
Never mind my fault 
Sorry I didn't ask because I knew
My fault.
No, no
they'd got something for you 
Actually er 
last Friday didn't they?
This erm  
Yes.
Yeah, he got me some springs
Yes well that's why I didn't ask because I assumed 
No 
you'd ordered everything
no
Sorry.
I only need a bit.I can get some from er  Chester perhaps, for what I want you know?
So er  how often does this  do they go to  then, how often is this order?
Is it 
Er this is just one that  I wanted some stuff and I said to a few people
Oh you went round?
I see, yeah.
and they're delivering it.
I've actually  the last time I got some delivered for me was February  so I tend to sort of get something about once a month I think.
Mm 
It really depends what I'm doing, if I'm doing a lot of   stuff, then I don't need 
Yeah 
to go because I've got all the hair 
Loads yeah
But at the moment I seem to have done a lot of  stuff with foam so 
I tend to forget, me, honest to god I think I've  plenty and then you come to the  you say oh god  you know  it's  never mind.
Well next time I'll remember you.
Next time if you'd ask me, and I still won't know.
Half past twelve!
I might as well go through on this, I was gonna go in that one.
Yeah
I'll, I'll go, this fellow's moving now so I'll go in there.

What can we do ?

This is bad enough!
All because of a brake that was 
Don't joke about things like that Paul, please!
But you know he'd got a huge parlour there was nothing wrong within this one thing  and you know, we tried to drill it out you know 
What?

He said here are  and tapping him over the nose  
He puts his head sort of, down 
Oh!

So, but when I tried it it 
Very funny!
Just all the luck of draw isn't it with things like that?
Oh yes 
You've just gotta be
Mhm.
!
If it's  if it seems solid 
 
then you  you got no
Stay away from the !
pipes.
The actual hose is about that long.
It looked as though he  it was all in one
Keep him quiet.
and then I spoke to the feller, said aye!
Is that the union?
It's supposed  
It's something there  in a magazine the other week there.
Found something wrong with his  
What animals do, like and what it means.
he said they just  do.
And they were saying that  when they lick each others  
 
Yeah  what does that 
you know?
Apparently 
 
it's the  the one who's doing the 
 
licking is looking at the  
But they tell you 
Yeah.
whatever they do 
it means
is the turn   
I thought  now erm  sort of 
So I did that both sides so that 
Like he's sort of saying that he's the boss!
Li like the leader of the .
Yeah.
Could be alternatively  older ones or something like that.
Well

keep your fingers crossed and not  
Oh I don't know I had a subjugated  about that.

So
Fair does like  rather than 
Mm,tha , that's why I didn't say like 
paying out for a
feet aren't they sometimes ?
And the brake pads had gone 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yes, you've gotta replace them 
They're sort of saying  that you are really testing your 
I mean, I replace mine 
To see that 
but but the brakes
Mm.
But  they don't  your 
But the brakes  literally bleed them 
I mean your cat.

Oh, well she told me she was working, but I'd never heard of, some sewing place, it must be in Wrexham.
Oh did she?
but she said they'd laid her off.
Oh!
Ooh dear, so er 
But at moment she isn't working but she said 
In between.

But I don't 
Mm.
 Bretfords sh , well she said, I'm sure she didn't say  Bretfords

Oh maybe, yeah.
trainees in  Leighbridge Do you remember when they had them
That's right yeah.
For so many months I think didn't they?
That's right.
And then  cos I said, ooh are, are they going to open up again?
Yeah.
But er  but it hasn't has it?
It wasn't anything no.
And nobody's taken the place over have they?
No it's just bought, well  they've got planks across it now, save the cars turning round in there.
Oh, boarded up the street?
Well, you know
The, the access roads, yeah.
Down  street  people going and parking up there.
Do , oh!
What a shame!
I mean
And it's  at the end it's 
The whole village  relied on that 
got a sale board 
didn't they for 
Yeah.
work?
I wonder what 
for sale or rent.
It's awful for the people that's at the wrong age, and too early to  retire really it's 
Yeah yeah 
You know early fifties and 
Too old to get another job!
Yeah, but it's all, Christ 
Er 
I mean you can't flaming well drive in, can't get out village!
No, when are you having driving lessons?
Ohhhh dear dear!
Oh !
Is that another story is it ?
You want empty road you see when you're trying
one lady said to me  take everyone else 
.
off the road and I'll be happy!
Isn't he terrible!
Oh!
I'm er 
Is he 
I, yeah  I go  well I've started going again now  er   aren't very good!
 
 
He said to me   should add   erm  you know like being 
Bit like 
is what he said.
Oh.
And he said you'll be able to go round the roundabout then I  the flaming things!
So he said you couldn't have done!
So I sa have, so I told him what he said, and he said  well that's exactly what it says in the book!
I said yes, well why don't you do it?
I said because in the bloody book there's no cars on the roundabout and I says it !
 
I said you bring me three o'clock 
You really  
 
in the morning I'll go round the roundabout for you when it's empty!
Mm, that's it  innit?
I said but when I come here there are cars everywhere, I says on  on the picture 
 
there isn't a car in sight!
He sat there and burst out laughing but he said  yeah you're right,there isn't !
Did you tend to come on 
No well    well I've started again now.
Yeah.
Does Yvonne go out with you or
No  because she's got an X R two and their, the insurance is too high for her to
Yeah.
to insure it for me.
Oh God, yeah!
Mm.
Well the insurance for her is higher then.
How's she doing anyway  still in er
She's doing a  
?
now in er  .
Oh good!
It's a new thing come out now  I don't know whether it's  
Two, er, two two thousand is it?
Project two thousand.
Yes.
Is that it?
Project two thousand 
Yeah.
that's right yeah.
She has 
Yeah.
to do so many big things, Bangor the University and so many .
Yeah  yeah  it
So they get like a degree or something 
it's 
at the end of it.
It's strange well  erm  I mean with, Bon's just qualified now  and she trying to get a job down in Portsmouth but erm  you know they're not they don't 
Terrible!
seem to be recruiting at the moment.
But erm  she was saying  there were a group that she sort of went  were alongside their group which were the 
Yeah.
Project two thousand, but it  it seems to be mostly class work  and very 
Yeah well 
little practical work, whereas  the group she was in  you know, it was so many weeks of school but the majority 
like Bonny hasn't she  
of it was actually  on the ward isn't it?
But he won't  come in Wrexham now they're not on the wards much.
No.
No.
And they only get advantage of getting  
A lot of it's er 
Well 
theory isn't it I believe  er 
Yeah.
Yeah.
they don't get a great  
Which  I mean for er  for a hospital taking people on like that, I mean erm  I would of said  i it would  would of been a better proposition to have somebody who's at least experienced.
Or  well Yvonne said she wouldn't 
Yeah.
have ever gone into nursing now because she said I wouldn't do it for a grant.
No.
You know I 
No.
wouldn't go for three years for a grant and just 
No.
No.
get nurses wages at the end of it!
That's 
 
right yeah.
If I was gonna get a job 
There's no incentive at all is there?
I'd go for something for higher wages at the end of it!
Mm.
Yes.
But, you know  she goes mad!
Yeah.
But she had a job as a nursing sister in erm   Yale , the private hospital before she done her midwifery but she's 
Oh yeah!
always wanted to do a midi so
Yeah.
she left that and she's gone  to do her midwifery  and now when she gets  the other day she was looking at old pay slips  God, she must have been an idiot to give up a sister's post cos she said  her wages have dropped terrible to do this course!
That's terrible isn't it?
Cos they won't pay you a sister's grade, they'll only  pay you an E grade.
Yeah, that's right.
To do a course.
They'll 
Yeah.
only go so high to do a course  and she was on an F grade so she had to  be taken down.
So she could drop.
And she said, when she qualifies it will be years before she's gets back to an F grade!
It's just ridiculous .
And they don't automatically give them a higher grade after a,.
So they've gotta go through that waiting period before you 
Yeah.
build up to the
Wait for someone to  die or retire or something 
Oh dear!
for you to go in 
She'll have to put a  banana skin at the top of the stairs 
that's their job isn't it?
for somebody!
It is, it's bad isn't it?
Yeah, yeah.
And she goes mad!
And then 
If er 
they train in  in Wrexham, in the midwifery  she says they haven't trained any for two years and they're not training any next year either!
Well I know Bon said er they'd they'd cut down on the recruiting  in fact, I think they'd closed one of the hospitals in Bristol  in the Frenchay where she is  has actually got to take  erm  qualified nurses from that hospital  before they take student nurses that they've trained 
Yeah.
so  you know, I mean it's gonna be difficult for a lot of them when they go.
But she went to  Caborange to do her orthopaedics didn't she?
Mm.
And she was toying with the idea whether to go and do her midwifery cos that's what she wanted to do
Yeah.
and then she said, well like, you know, I don't know!
Anyway, she went to  she took this  sister's post in The Yale
Mm.
to wait for her midwifery to come through  and then er  they've closed that
Does she have to 
ward.
pay for this course  by the way?
No, she gets paid on any rate.
Oh, I see.
See, Bon would have pay  for 
Yeah.
going on an extra  she said after 
Yeah.
she'd finished her training she's had to 
Yeah.
actually pay for the course!
They do in  erm 
for the
Wendy, our neighbour's daughter's erm
Was that erm
she's gonna have to pay for 
ward management course they paid for, some of them 
No it wasn't  
cos some girl went on a ward management course 
I'm not sure now.
and they have to pay.
But Yvonne was sent to do that on  Cabowin she was lucky!
She went on a  they sent her on a ward management course there.
Oh so
So she's had that
Yeah.
she's got her orthopaedics  that orthopaedics ward's closed down now!
So it's a good job she didn't  move on there.
That's terrible isn't it?
Cos she said luckily I 
And the , there's a crying need for the  for nurses in the hospitals and wards  and the , and they sort of they're cutting down  you know, on the hospital programme  closing wards  er, not employing nurses when they need them  you know, and they're trying to get 
And the private hospitals are  and she 
one person to do five people's jobs!
came from the hospital to  to do her midwifery  and there was a boy  in Wrexham Hospital  he'd give up the permanent job to go to The Yale
Mm.
and  he was saying a month and they'd laid him off and he can't back into Wrexham Hospital!
Oh good!
But that is awful isn't it?
Well you'd think that there'd be plenty of er opportunities in the private  sector wouldn't you?
Apparently what they're doing in the private sector taking er  ooh what do you call them?
Yvonne does it
Oh, like erm
Oh!
Like er, I was going to say a stand-by, what 
Oh Gosh!

What was the use of this word marry in all the 
It's the ghost!
?
I didn't want  nana 
However 
nan to see it.
And in Shakespeare's
However
Erm
So marry in .
No, no, they say 
Marry is 
marry will you  erm, I don't know!
How wo 
It's just 
I kept thinking somebody was getting married !
No, no!
 
Marry  
then I realised it.
Asked me three bloody times!
Well go on!..
You're interpretation.
It's just erm
How would you translate that?
You can see it  nanny can see it!
What do we say then?
However!
Say, it just 
See it.
says.
Ooh yes, that's horrible that isn't it!
Urgh!
I thought it was a verb that?
denied  oh put it away!
No, it's not 
mm.
a verb is it?
Here are
Put that in the horror section!
you can take it  take it home .
It's not a verb it's just the
Yes, I don't know erm
And insertive one which means, you know 
in what context you'd use that.
No passion in it is erm  I mean  the words that they use is  a words that I use 
 
are nothing like the ones that he using!
No, no,.
No,wha , what 
They say what they feel like.
What I find if you you  when they get to erm  not necessarily a speech  but a pertinent part  you've got to read it two or three times
Analyse.
Yes.
and there's the parts that's   or obvious or  they're not so important, you know, between
Mm.
tha that's how I  anyway 
See it.
I can sort of get through it and erm  understanding it's  
Mm.
is the most important thing.
And it does start to sink through after a while.
I was gonna say it can be quite  laboured when you first read some of it 
Mm.
because erm  and you do have to 
Especially if you haven't, sort of, read anything like it before, you know 
Mm.
I mean  I remember reading a few bits in English but, you know,
You'll have to buy , have you seen, did you see King Lear when it was on  on the television?
Cos I taped that as well.
No.
You'll have to have a look at that, that's quite good.
Mm.
Laurence Olivier.
It's amazing once you reach thirty that  some sort of  inside you go !
Yes, I think they make, I can 
 
remember going to see  Hamlet with er  Laurence Olivier at er  while I was still at school  and er  we thought it 
What real?
was great!
Live?
Laurence i no, no, the film!
Oh the film!
Mm, you know the black and white one?
Yeah.
And erm
I tell you what , did you see 
must of be , be about nineteen 
criticism of him?
fifty one, fifty two  and we thought it was great going to the pictures, you know, when you were still at school, actually  you know, in, on a school day sort of thing!
Oh yeah.
And I can 
 
remember going in and seeing this film  and, it just  it didn't  it was so  to my mind, and you know thinking back now, my memory of it was of a sort of very  dark and dreary
Mm.
film a , the language meant nothing to me at all!
Mm.
I, I no I couldn't understand it!
And it's only sort of, as you say, when you get older and you 
That you learn it.
sort of 
well that's right, I mean, that's why I wasn't really into it 
Becomes more apparent.
cos when I did English at school I just  you know, you had to learn the poetry and that and 
Mm.
just say, you can take a poem home and learn it and then recite at the next lesson and then used it just 
That's right.
Cos really 
 
a lot of it is just parrot-fashion, unless you're a very  unusual person I think 
That's it yeah.
it doesn't really 
Brain child!
sort of, have any significance until you get a bit older.
I don't know whether it's 
Mm.
sort of, life's experience  make it mean more to 
Mm.
to you.
And 
Erm  possibly understand  through 
Mm.
you know ex ex experience as you get older.
The the  that er criticism on er, of the 
The tape's on, did you know?
Is it?
Or is that just  is that on all the time?
No, it's just the light.
Oh, I thought it was running  okay.
Erm  of Laurence Olivier,emphasized wro wrongly  you know, when he was speaking  certain parts into the  if he thought the audience was flagging then he'd  speak a bit louder to  you know 
Mm.
Wake them up !
Then draw them in , yeah, yeah.
   
I should think he's  totally overrated!
Mm.
the way he spoke, maybe that his part and not  he was that, think he's a  took over the part if you know what I mean?
Instead of 
Mm.
just letting people see the part and  experiencing it 
The role.
and, yes, the role of  Montesago 
Mm and he he became 
It was always Laurence Olivier and 
Mm.
such as, you know the way he plays it.
I mean, I can remember seeing an interview with er, John Geilgud and he'd  he'd done Hamlet many years ago  and er but  he said he'd  it was  in a totally different way  you know, different
Mm.
interpretation that he put on his  er
a much er  more lyrical, perhaps  you know, less  erm  intense and er
Passionate.
yeah,i more ath 
So everybody went to sleep?
lot more athletic version if you like, that, than er  Laurence Olivier, than  John 
Yeah.
Geilgud did.
And he 
I don't think he did anything in his later years did he?
Laurence Olivier to, sort of, equal what  
No.
Any of the films I've seen is all erm 
Well erm  there's  Richard the Third of course, and er
No I mean, when he was like you know  Boys from Brazil, I mean 
Oh yes!
That's cottoned 
Yeah.
on a bit.
Well I can't  I mean erm  I think  he was the kind of person he wanted to  be as diverse as possible later on, I mean, perhaps he felt  constrained 
 
by the
today
fifty eight roles he'd done earlier on in his career and he wanted to sort of you know, have a go at everything  
Marrying, marrying on 
didn't he?
so rank as may dishonour him .
Marry  the, and an apostrophe is it?
Yeah.
Married.
Well then, there's none so er 
Ah!
you know  that's the  it is.
I wonder why it was  a ?
Well it's just a word like 
Well that's, where did they get it from?
An expression.
Mm.
Shall I 
Ooh Thames!
therefore 
You 
Erm 
can hardly see why   
then
the more you wish 
yeah  
Well 
Oh well!
Very  well said!
Very well sa well read!
That's it  well done!
Well done!
Mm.
Or however  
Or whatever,.
Yes, and it's funny how languages change isn't it, over the  over the years?
Only when you  can see words that we've got now that adapted from  words  then.
Mm.
Some of them  some of them, you know, slight change.
Yes, some of it's very recognisable.
But some of the words have all gone just now and 
Erm 
and eventually  some speech 
 
Yeah.
and the dreams.
Ahh.
And there's some that are er  non-famous  it's got a load of  in Hamlet.
Mm.
So then, I thought oh no, it's just gone over my head this!
So, when I finished reading that  explanation of it, maybe I'll  have a stab at it.
But it makes you wonder, really, when you  when you  look at something like that  how  erm  how well represented that was  or representative of the kind of language that wa , that was used by er, ordinary people.
At the time, yes.
I mean  or is it just the author's view  of how
Yeah.
erm
Well it took him 
 
What?
What about  Maisy?
Some people say it was him that wrote it.
Oh!
Mm.
What's   is that Emily again?
I'm gonna have 
Yes!
What do you want ?
Is this  our old book?.
Mm.
I thought so.
Yeah.
 
Alright, you're  !

Mm.

How long is that going to take?
Only half an hour  
Oh!
Do it when the fan goes out.
I just lost a bit, oh there it is!
Oh, eggshell?
No  a bit of  a bit of not worth mentioning!
Yeah, phoned Jeannette the other day to see what she'd done about college now.
Mm.
She's so impatient Jeannette!
God, she wants to know everything!
She's always  down my ear, saying well what exactly did you do and  and what did you do next?
I remember when I  we I was working when I first met her and I've  you know, just before I had Scott  and she said, well how did you get a job?
What did you do there?
So I was saying, well what about the grant, you know, what do you have to do?
She said, well just ring Town Hall, you know!
Well
She keen to give you any 
Well, yes I know that!

And of course, if her husbands off like, it's ooh don't bother me now, there's a few girls like you know!
Mm.
Cath's gone like that now!
She's sort of, all over you  all week  and yet, when her husband is there, not her husband, her boyfriend  she 
Mm.
doesn't wanna know, you know!
Well  I suppose you can understand in a way.
Well I  yeah.
I do !
Sort of!

So he married her  this girl  anyway, they're divorced now, like you know, I thought

She lo , I mean she's a lovely girl though!
Ni , a nice natured girl 
Yeah.

Very, oh very  loves children 
Easy going.

Oh I was on about sewing cos I said I'd let them, you know, they were all doing a bit of sewing the other weekend, they all had a go like  erm  ooh, you know, I was saying he  that Scott can cook and that, you know, we've had a note   he's having one on, supposed to be all  all of them to be independent, you know?
Mm.
But I always seem to end up lecturing when I'm  talking to him, you know instead of just   saying, I was saying  I want them all to be independent, you know!
She must think I'm really mad!
You know, this divorced woman, you know!
She's very nice Ann, she's okay.
Mm.
We've got to do er, we were doing these Mother's Day cards and she said, oh we've got to ta , the curriculum has changed now
Mm.
the teachers aren't allowed to dictate  the children, if they want  erm  to do something or make something they have to make up a plan of what they're gonna do first
Mm.
and they have to think of it all by themselves, the teachers can't say ooh  ooh well put flowers on there.
They can't suggest anything.
That's 
Yeah.
it, yeah, and she said a cos he's like it, she said it is very hard she said, I'm used to  saying 
Showing them.
Yeah, do this 
Mm.
and they I said, yeah, so I got  oh and they came up with some really good a ideas, you know!
Cut out 
Mm.
cards and that.
Yeah  quite spontaneous.
Two of these halves on a turtle design  erm  er  the door had two halves but they managed to put one part like that, cut 
Make them look like turtles!
it out and  put legs on !
 
And she said, oh yes, she  di 
Fine children!
So I hope they  
It just shows you how they're in influenced though doesn't it, by 
Yeah.
But the 
you know?
rest of them, I mean
films and television 
Ooh they looked terrible!
and
Yeah.
Oh, there were ones that didn't look like Mother's day cards but still!
But er  Mr  sort of  the student teacher there, he's a bit of alright, like!
He's a bit young for me!
And er  he was hovering behind me in the classroom, like  you know !
I mean,he was getting something out of the cupboard,ha nothing to do with me !
But er, Laura likes him like, you know, she says  Jamie  pinched my crisps before, you know  just imagine all these little girls  giggling!
Mm.
And  all the classroom.
And erm  when we were doing these cards  Mrs , that's Scott's old teacher, she's very nice, very modern
Mm.
was telling this story about this princess, this very erm  independent princess didn't wanna know about the  prince, like er, it was quite a funny story !
But er  gosh, you , you made me jump you!
You know,so they must of been talking about it
Twenty four hour television, now then.

I is it the four screen one we've been watching?

So it's
But it is .
screen!
That's
Not the same.
Oh!
What's that er  that 
Where d'you go?
Where did go, Roberts's?
Yeah.
Mhm.
We said you would.
Looked in there didn't you?
I thank you sir!
Oh!
They put up the telly  
 
Why d'you keep telling me?
the back.
That could well be 
Well 
something else.
I think they've gotta .
Signals.
Now that's something I won't  with a bit sloping down.
Oh now it's on the back of the house?
That's right
and then
so the house may need 
Mm.
a place  would it, wouldn't have been
Oh, in the right spot?
It doesn't, it's not too bad there like, especially when we went to, you know it's not  there's no .
Yeah.
Yeah.
But er  they said I couldn't have it there 
 
the wind would get 
Ye 
it too much.
Yes.
Oh funny thing I was  having a look at one of Carrie's, she's got the Radio Times which we don't get, only at Christmas time.
Yes.
And have  having a look a the er  the films you know  Sky and er, what's 
Yeah.
the other one?
Sky one and two it is.
Oh is that ha , is that  
But there's an ano , there was some other name wasn't there?
No?
No.
Oh!
What both  from the same  same dish?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And all o 
 
all the different erm films that are on, you know.
pay monthly for that now or
No, I borrowed that.
No, but I mean don't you have to pay for those 
Oh for the films, I haven't got, I haven't got that.
Oh!
What's that?
How does that work then?
I don't understand at all.
Well you have to have, you have to have a  the only the trouble with it is, I've got , I'll either have to put them up here  or I'll have to  scrape  scrape some of the wall out  I can't close the door!
I measured everything bar there!
Is it the way  
Oh!
No.
I thought you meant the shelf was up  wrong!
Oh that's  too deep!
You see  I've 
Oh.
it's not to deep, it fits in.
Mm.
But what I've got 
It don't 
you've got have the aerial at the back  and that connects 
And that's protruding you see.
You see.
I see.
And like, so I can't close the door.
I didn't think you had to ha have the aerial coming from the   for the hole in the wall.
Yeah !
You 
Yeah.
I'll just have them on there you see, that's 
Mm.
Mm.
So as I can  
Oh, that's a shame!
Couldn't you have that hinge mounted  slightly further forward 
I've asked for a  
on the  on the  
that's for so much.
That's what they want  that's what they used for it .
That would hold it dead out then wouldn't it?
I told them I've lost my .
No, it wouldn't make any 
Put it 
difference.
Save the hassle, yeah.
Alright, well i well it would!
Surely it would!
I mean if you've set that there 
Why?
at the moment.
I mean you'd 
No!
have a gap.
You won't!
I mean hi 
Well normally you'd see 
Well no,you'd have to alter the other one as well wouldn't you, to make it e even 
Mm.
Yes, oh 
Mm 
ay!
Mm
But I mean it wouldn't, you wouldn't close that  
The only other thing 
on that  it wouldn't close on that.
The only other thing you could do 
Oh ah!
Ken is have those taken off  and, is this a door here?
Yeah.
And have those mounted on the bottom  so that it's a drop down shelf.
What would that do?
But there again it still wouldn't
Wouldn't do anything!
Mm.
Couldn't use that though could you?
Well, no, I'm just thinking you could  have it sent , but I mean it was just  be on that one now wouldn't it?
No it still wouldn't , no it still wouldn't close would it?
Wouldn't close would it?
You could do the same with both of them though wouldn't you?
Oh absolutely!
Oh!
So 
 
Same thing is to take the  take screws off and just try and door and see whether how much  extra  space you need, I mean, maybe  you might be able to do it by just  
Well it 
Well I'm sure, I'm sure 
Yeah but you can tell when you put 
you could  move that forward there!
Well gotta have the hole haven't you?
Space 
I know!
between the 
Yes!
two
You're not gonna see it cos there's one on the end, it's right next to the wall isn't it?
Have a gap there but I mean  whereas at the moment it's like that, not to that.
Even though it's on the front 
to there 
of the cabinet aren't you, it's gonna protrude beyond  close the 
But 
right hand one now.
but it does now though doesn't it?
I mean they're sticking out 
Well I mean, you're gonna be another 
like that.
It's gonna be another inch isn't it?
Yeah, but that's neither here nor there!
Cos the top's got a good overlap.
I mean you wouldn't notice that would you Ken?
I wouldn't be bothered about that.
Just looking for a solution to the problem that's all!
Got to think about these things you know.
Ooh, I know what I was going to do!
Going on broadcasting now?

I'm trying to keep our dogs out of the lounge cos they've been on the settee that many times 
Mm.
and I've  we've taken the  the old settee down to Carrie's  and moved the two seater and the armchair down  this end  and they flew in tonight straight up on the sofa, I said to   it's gonna be tough for a week or so but they've gotta get used to staying on the floor, I'm not having them on the furniture all the time cos they just absolutely ruin it!
Especially when it's like this, now they go outside and it's 
And they come in, I mean he skids in the hall at night I mean it's my fault I threw the rubber ring towards the kitchen  down the hall  he sort of skidded before he got there and there was a, and he must of had mud er, you know like  like he had 
oh that's 
dirt in between his toes 
there's there's and we just, what he must of had  and he skidded and there was a blooming long track of mud down the carpet you know!
So
Well you just, you just don't think  you know, I mean, about  every time you sprinkle  dog wipe 
Well this is the trouble 
wiping
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or you forget that it's wet, or whatever!
Yeah.
Like 
Yeah.
I say, this time of the year, it's rotten!
That's the thing that even when it's dries out it still clings to the 
Well it does, yeah!
skin  and 
Yeah.
it just comes off as dust  on 
Yeah.
on the furniture you know!
Mm.
I mean they should be in the ruddy kitchen I suppose, but then you get to the stage where it's
Well they should be outside 
 
in a kennel!
That's what I always say!
Is there any good having a ruddy dog, you know, I mean, why do you have one 
Well we 
to start with?
we like pets
You know, I mean it's 
Well they're 
they're fairly close 
Yes.
to hand but erm
you know, I don't wanna go to bed with them!
Well
You know, there is a limit!
Yeah.
That, you've gotta say well 
Yeah well it's a
you can do this but you can't do that  and and really  they're, they're like children in a way, they will sort of try it on as much as they can get away with it!
Well of course!
So
Ooh there!
Oh what they're doing?
That's why I said to you don't feed them titbits at the table because it's so easy to 
It 
get them
well it is, is!
and they sit there and he's gorping at you while you're eating you know!
And they jus , just just just, yeah I think it's er, it's habit that.
Well Luc Lucy, Lucy,Luc !
You're not supposed to be on here!

either that or banging his head on the wall!
Mm  well this is certainly a nice television!
As telly's go!
Mm mm.
Seem to be a lot of German  stations on it, aren't there?
Well  ha, perhaps because of the size of the country then there maybe more stations  than  in France, or maybe it's just the way the satellite  is pointing to pick up  you know, you just happen to pick up more German stations, I don't know!
Well there seem to be quite a few German  er, German!
Quite a few American  erm  documentaries, almost aren't they?
Those  
 
.
Mm.
Peace programmes and that, I don't know whether they're just being broadcast  I mean you wo you know, Ken, you know those American programmes that were on?
Just a minute!
I'm just wondering whether they were 
Ya.
were they being transmit , they weren't being picked up from the U S A were they?
I don't know to 
 
be honest.
Unless they're being, unless they transmit them from one satellite to another.
, but whether they are or whether they're 
And then down to us.
re pre-recorded or what, I don't know.
Oh yes.
I just wondered 
But the 
whether the Germans would be, I mean if it's coming from a German  T V station but do they  broadcast American  you know, English speaking programmes there in Germany 
Must do.
for us to pick them up here I mean.
Well, I I've er  I don't know how they do it really.
Because they were all in English, well  American .
Yeah.
I do , I don't know to be honest.
No.
You just er, you just take it for granted don't you?
You got a book then?
Well I mean a film 
just read up on it and let us know!
it showed you Michael Caine, well that was all dubbed wasn't it?
 
Oh well no, those are films aren't they?
Ha, why are you wagging this?
You mean the documentaries?
You scallywag!
Er, oh!
The documentaries and that, I mean er 
Er oh!
I suppose they  th , well they must what's his name?
Be, if they dubbed them they must be  pre-recorded.
Mm 
Mm.
but they, I mean, oh  they weren't dubbed were they?
I mean, so they couldn't have been for er er Germany.
No , I mean the, no they can't be 
 
for the German audience, they must be for the British.
Yes  you know.
Al , although some of them  they do them in German
and
er  well there's one there that's a continual  er  it is American, well it's an American style programme but I mean they advertise  all kinds of things from all 
Mind you, bearing in mind they've still got 
but they give the prices at the end.
Yeah.
They give the prices in all the different countries see?
Yeah.
I mean the different 
Different currencies.
currencies.
Er  I was gonna say 
 
they've still got  American bases there haven't they?
I know they've been pulling a lot out 
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
but there are still American bases .
Well they've still got American bases there.
So maybe er  maybe they do transmit there.
For 
Well they could do.
the English speaking
Yeah!
You know?
Well I mean it would  
Troops, forces that are there.
With modern technology it wouldn't be any problem would it?
We have the the technology!
The technology!
They're bound to be !
Build you up  and we can knock you down!
Kick your arse!
What did Ken  say  they think all they gotta do is kick arses!
Who the
That one was Tenerife was it?
Cos it said like  like holiday maker so they get up there for a rest!
And he sent a photograph of you know, people in the boat and  eating these things, you know?
I said I must watch that on Monday night, I like the wildlife programmes.
Yeah, some of them are good!
Trouble is, it's always the disappearing ones isn't it?
Yes, usually it's  you're sort of bombarded from all sides by
The doomed!
the seemingless endless problems that yo unable to  to do very much about!
That was a cracker that Dimbleby did!
Done it with Susie .
The part where they went to the erm  the  what do they call it now?
The flooded forest
Oh the erm
flooded for six months of the year wasn't it?
The rain for , er no, it wasn't the rain forest, but yes.
The flooded rain forest or something was it?
I think it was.
Well I don't think it was a rain forest!
Was this the river that overflowed in this particular   created this  this lu 
For six months of the year it was under water!
Yeah!
The trees and a a all of those  
All these creatures came out of the mud and
Yes, yeah, I, well I taped it didn't I?
Got it on tape then .
Did you?
Mm.
Flooded rain forest, I'm sure that's what it was called.
And then, the other six months of the year when the water  recedes  a different sort of species comes and inhabits this area and then 
Mm.
again, the cycle
Amazing!
it goes on again.
Yeah.
But didn't they have  didn't they say the  fresh water's ?
Yeah.
Allsorts!
It isn't gonna be very deep!
No.
But obviously deep enough for er
Yeah when if  the rains came and  it started to er  pour away, my God it was  tumultuous!
Going down to the valleys.
Mm.
Mm.
I think it must have been the 
What's that programme that was on the other day about the erm  ohhh!
Where was it?
No Ga , was it Ghana?
About the trees?
About the, yes, this
Yes.
 exposee about the 
Ghana.
er  well that was corruption from the government!
Well I suppose most corruption starts at the top doesn't it?
It has to for it to be  festering at the bottom!
But erm
Good grief man!
Good Lord Ken!
You've gone to town tonight seeing all this!
Ooh hell!
No not really 
Er 
just a bit of cheese  and a bit of  pate.
You know it seems it awful really that two of those places were   aren't they?all these, all the forest 
Oh God!
fern and
Thanks er
I mean if somebody did grow a tree  I mean, it must be harder in that kind of area but  but wi with the right will for people  to plant a tree and grow it  it's just as easy 
Ahhh.
as chopping it down!
Well, you know, I mean with 
Up.
correct management they should be able to  profit from the forests  you know a as well replenish them.
And so unfortunately, it's the short term that's all they think about!
Ah,it's not.
At the end of the day it's just greed and profit to gain 
If you want a decent tree to grow 
and sod tomorrow!
If you want decent trees it takes a long time to grow them!
Well the hardwoods, yeah.
Yeah,
Mm.
I mean they don't grow overnight do 
Yeah.
But even so, I mean  even that can be managed.
Course it can.
At the moment they just 
What is this Ken?
That's  German smoked.
You don't have to light it!
It's rather nice that!
Is it?
We've tried this before when
Didn't you try it at  ah ah, try it.
I can't remember now.
No, I don't think so.
I don't think we had any cheese did we?
Can't remember that.
Ee  ah  trouble is you can't see where your cut is  when you slice it like that it, oh here we go!

Well Ray likes it.
Oh these are nice!
I was born to a

Born to a good life.

Oh yes!
Well it hasn't happened yet but still!
Oh!
So was I, I was convinced!

Better things.
I was, I was left on  on the doorstep  
The wrong handbag Ken, you was didn't you?
For the rich.
I read that story Ken.
yes.
What happened?
They kept saying that 
We what?
they never came back for me.
Saying well here here's an ugly little bugger let's do a swop!
And they left me instead!
They took the ugly one !
So, oh well!
What's that Cheshire one?
I haven't tried that.
Perhaps er  I got that
Crumbly, is it?
I got it from, I don't know, I got it from  Holston's and I haven't had any from there before.
I went into that  Roberses the delicatessen part
Mm.
and er  they were queuing up there so I couldn't be bothered  standing in the queue, so I didn't.
Didn't get it from there?
I didn't stay there for that.
Mm, that's distinctive isn't it  the smoked one!
Mm.
Very nice!
I haven't had  this  particular one before but we used to get  a little used to be able to get it in little  about 
Yeah.
tha , that big  and er  no, I expect the 
It's on    don't, they reckon they can make Cheshire anywhere now can't they?
No, it's not what it used to be.
There must be somebody who can get it?
Get what?
Cheshire cheese is not  necessarily  indigenous to Cheshire now.
Oh  what,wha 
They make it in lots of places.
you mean it's been made in Devon 
No  
and called Cheshire cheese?
Well I don't know about Devon, I'm not sure.
No, I I do , I think it's erm
Only made in Cheshire?
I would have thought so.
You mean they're using the recipe somewhere else?
Yes.
Oh.
Making and you
I don't think so.
over the over the road into
Whatever!
 
whatever.
In North Wales.
I don't know, I would have thought that  to call it Cheshire cheeses  it must be
Ain't got any ruddy North Wales cheese or Clwyd, so what ?
Perhaps in the 
Mm.
used,ya , you used to be able to get it and it would crumble  it was rea , you know real 
Oh yeah that was distinctive part of it.
That  cor It was er
Not like that now.
No.
I always remember going to, somewhere with Ken   this girl gave us a lump of cheese, it must of been Cheshire.
Ooh I  I loved that!
They got this bloody knife  and cut half the bloody cheese, I thought  I mean, I'm not a polite person when it comes to food am I?
Must of had about two ounces on the bloody plate!
Haven't got the thing on now have you, while you  feeding yourself 
No.
up?
Munching !
He's one of the little munchkins!
And then, when he was eating the
putting the marmalade on his toast in the hotel  the knife
And licked the knife!
Ooh, oh!
You scallywag!
I mean you do that sort of thing at home don't you, but
You scallywag!
Oh Christ !
Yeah!
Yes you are!
It's just how he was brought up I suppose an 
I remember reading this book  it was  partly, it was about the German Navy
Mm?
and er  sh , you know  the test before they could become officers  they set captain  set  the table, you see the  and  they have this  food that they know how, how to use the cutlery, this was one of the tests of being an officer.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
You know, to er  they didn't know how to use the cutlery, and, they were, they we , yeah 
Which piece to use for which course.
they weren't, they weren't gentlemen so they couldn't be er  they couldn't be officers.
Mm.
Oh there's a lot of that well done wasn't there?
It's called the class structure.
Yeah.
Or system.
Well, ironically his creed was supposed to be without that wasn't it  Hitler?
You know, this supreme race but all  more or less equal.
Well no, that wasn't the case!
He wanted to create  a supreme race didn't he?
No, but the er  the Germans  they were the supreme body weren't they?
he's he's   and er  he wanted to create a super race.
But the army was run on the old style wasn't it?
Of course.
You know, they were the  they were the er  the masters of the army.
Oh well, this was the main course Ray!
And then of course the Air Force, they'd be one up again I suppose.
Ah well  then maybe
You mean the Luftwaffe?
Mm.
Mm mm.
The   .
Well this is 
Luftwaffe.
Betty.
Mm.
Unfortunately there seems to be a resurgence of  of this now doesn't there  in Europe?
Yes.
This right wing element which is
Terrible!
It's frightening really because you think well  you know, I mean  you said the years well that couldn't happen 
Well 
again but  but how long does it take before it does happen again?
I mean, do the other  do these things happen in cycles and tha you know, is it possible that it'll happen again on a greater scale?
A grand 
Well 
scale, if you like?
it er  I mean, it's  having grounds now because of the recession!
Yes.
That is, that 
Yes.
is what brought it about er in 
Setting the stage for 
in one way, in in
Although it hasn't  it hasn't come to that in Germany, I mean we'll probably be the poor man of Europe at the moment aren't we?
In this country?
Ah but, I mean it's biting in Germany now because they've got all East Germans!
That's  yes, yes, that's true.
Biting before that weren't it?
Where 
Erm 
they've had to close down the spi ,and that.
and of course, when, when they  when
This of course is exacerbated.
but  the going gets tough it's  it's easy to blame minority groups and this is what happened before wasn't it?
Like on the ruddy  that's all they're doing now, bringing all these Turks and God knows what!
Ha!
I mean, even in France, and I mean, in fact, in fact 
East Germany, poor devils they 
in France it's more  it's worse  in in  some respects because er  it seems to be more powerful the erm  the rate of  you know, the feeling of .
I mean what can you, what can we do?
If, it's happening, I mean  what was the Soviet Union I mean it's
Well I said to Margaret, I wonder 
news on it  it's death and destruction there isn't it?
All these minority
I wonder
groups.
with the Western Groups  after the euphoria of saying oh there, well we've cracked it now!
We've destroyed communism.
Are they now regretting it?
And, I don't 
To some degree.
Well
No, no I think they've 
And, and the fact that they don't know what's gonna happen, how to contain all this 
Well I think in some respects 
stress.
they, they wanted the downfall of communism
Oh they did want it!
but  nevertheless it's better the devil you know!
But, having said that  you know, that  I should imagine that the military  are  regretting it.
Well I mean, the military will definitely 
 
regretting it, in in   the west 
Didn't actually want it to go this far.
because it means  a reduction in forces in in  all these 
Yeah.
countries  erm, and as you say, I mean ha  you know, whether they're American generals or or  the Soviet  generals, whatever  er they're all, they're all feeling the pinch now because er
Oh I didn't mean that, I mean 
At the same time it, I mean the countries wo , have been crippled by the  the burden of er  defence if you like  and we'll call it defence.
And they have!
Erm, but in fact it's probably for some of the state that we're in now!
But er
I would I wouldn't sa , I wouldn't of said 
There's a price to pay for everything.
that you see  they have created the jobs!
Yes  yeah  but I don't know, it seems crazy to me when they've 
Well that's false economy that!
There's such  you know  sort of appalling need
Yes, but that was the get,
 
that was your get out!
Or the  or the er  boost in the, in the economy  you know but erm 
Yeah, but I don't think
but I mean they were mo they were making  
Might work in our economy, but not in theirs I don't think!
Well it hasn't!
But instead 
Oh no!
of getting on with the  five years plans they've put too much effort into producing  war machines!
Well and this is it  I mean, where we could afford it they couldn't!
Well can we?
Look at America!
Well
They've got greater means, I know 
No, they, they could of they could of  afforded better than the
Oh yeah!
you know?
Yeah.
Only just.
So, and unfortunately erm  well 
I mean they, they were exploiting  or they had  they had the potential exploit more countries  than Russia did.
Oh course!
That is er
Oh yeah, they colonised all these places but  it makes you wonder, you know, you see all this unemployment  and of course this John Major's in his  answer now is ooh well it's the same everywhe , it's not, not here, it's everywhere!
They don't say why?
Well it is.
Yeah, but why?
But
Oh but I mean  that is not 
 
the concern, and that is not the question,i the question is what are you going to do about it in our country?
What are 
Exactly!
you 
Mm.
Exactly!
But I mean the  have an excuse don't they?
Well that's  that's it  you know that er  it's an excuse.
I mean, it's a convenient excuse, that is 
Course it is!
that .
I mean  I was reading in the paper the other day  it was on about recycling
Yes, just a  please.
And the different counties 
Say stop!
and the way they've approached it and some 
Yep.
of the more progressive ones, you know they've er  addressed the problem of  rubbish and  recycling wo erm  one spokesperson for  somewhere like Milton Keynes, I think it was  said there's  you know, there's no money to made out of ri , recycling
No.
and yet he said
Not at the moment.
that they would save  erm  on the erm actual tipping of rubbish
How isn't there any money 
because 
to be made out of recycling 
Well  well this is what
Well at the moment it's so dear 
well what he meant was 
to
th , I mean he said they  
process it.
we are not 
Well 
we are not dealing with anything that we cannot 
In the short term.
sell.
In 
Ah.
other words they were selling glass, and they were selling  metal  back to  whatever  and manufacturers  to re-use  but  in terms of collecting and the cost of collecting it all and and 
That's expensive!
handling all this it's, yeah.
The cost that they were  having to bear were greater than what they were actually getting back on the sale of this stuff.
But, at the same time  the  normal sort of refuse if you like, disposable  was being reduced  because
That's right!
these other items weren't in the normal refuse collection and therefore they were going to sort of reduce them from a weekly collection to a 
Well that's if 
fortnightly collection, so they would be saving in that  
Well that  er 
But not saving to these 
that's if 
particular firms 
that 
that they want.
that's if 
No.
Mm.
That is  their own fault  because according to, there was a programme on there and it was saying  they, they must be selling it to these firms that recy , that use it
Mm.
they must be selling it 
Well they will do.
them very cheap  because it was sa , this programme was on about recycling 
No thanks.
and it said  about tin cans and aluminium and that  and it was costing them less  excuse me  to use recycled  you know er  used aluminium
Mm.
and used steel cans and that  it was costing them  less to use that  than it was to use
Brand new stuff.
yeah.
Yeah.
So, I mean  to me, I don't know whether I'm right, but  that my first thought is that they must be buying it very 
It's gotta be profitable 
they must be buying it very cheap then?
Mm.
Mm.
So, so the people that are not making any money out of it by doing it  are selling it to them very cheap  so it is their own fault!
I think initially er  
It's only it's been cheaper to 
now has got a cost more  in the initial 
Well it does 
stages  until it's sort of, set up, until  everyone is sort of you know  geared into doing this  kind of  you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the  goes there 
Well yes, because they're not 
and all the companies that are responsible for  for re-using it  and all the  distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there  you know, once that network is going then surely 
Oh yes!
it's gotta be  useful because  instead of going  you know  from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being  ever seen again  it's going 
That's right!
in a circle and, and  surely that's gotta be cheaper once a network is set up?
And it's a, it's an ongoing thing  
Yeah!
You know I mean, oh oh di you know I mean  it's to theorise, I suppose but I mean all it takes really is to have  three bins.
Yeah.
You have your paper  you have your  bottles
  
you know alright  initially as you say  it take, it costs  but
To set it up 
it does , to set it up,yo you have  you have, you'll have to have three, three what's his names?
Three, three bin men  to come and collect it.
Mm.
Or no, you have to have three containers.
But they do it in Canada!
Well this is what I'm saying!
Yeah.
But I mean 
Even even got one 
you see 
for plastic!
but, but there  well yo , you could have four, you could have as many as you like
Mm.
but I mean  surely, in the long term
Course!
but that co 
idea he doesn't drink beer, so you can have his for
Well no,but I mean like 
But that's the key word is the long term Ken!
like you sell, you sell that back  to them  that that pays  the man's wages that is doing it!
Mm.
Mm.
But it's the short term isn't it, with them?
They just thinking well we haven't got the machinery to cope with this!
It's easier for us 
No the 
to buy the new raw material and process it 
Yeah I said
and it  ah
Ah but  
but yeah, I know but the 
well this is the 
This is the way the government's gotta act now!
Ah well, well this is it 
Well this is it it, it has to be done!
They won't!
Generated the 
This is the trouble 
It's a joke!
this is the trouble with this country  because it's has has   
I mean look at Germany!
Yeah, but I mean they will make progress, I mean this colony 
And  
is  would never 
Mm.
advance!
I mean that's why we lost our moto er  motorcycle industry
Yeah.
it's why we've lost most of our industry  because they won't, they won't invest in new machinery or mo , new methods!
Modernisation.
I mean they've 
Just won't look ahead!
You see it's the same as they said on there  we've had all these inventions
and they get  by our country.
and they get, they get  in this country  and then they go and exploit them in another country!
Mm.
So where's the 
Computer's the  finest example of that  produced 
But 
in Manchester!
Mm.
This government says ooh we can't afford that, no, it's a  it's a gimmick!
The Yank says we will!
Bingo!
And look, this used to be
We could of held them to ransom!
one of the best education systems in the world!
And I mean  
I know, it isn't now!
won't be here now  well you could  sliding right 
I know!
down the scale!
Mm.
We're terrible!
We're way behind 
 
Germany, France 
 
you can only cut back 
Russia 
and prune back so much in the name of efficiency before  sooner 
Well 
or later things su suffer!
There was, there was a programme on Channel Four there to I was watching  before I picked my book up  and  they had Conservative  Labour bloke and the independent er  Liberals  and these were supposedly  they have on on er Channel Four a a programme called Week in Politics  anyway  this night, this, tonight they were doing a  a fu , they had a floating audience, supposedly a floating audience 
You mean, they were under water?
flo ,fa floating vo er voters
Oh!
er  until, until the end  and they had a poll of er  who  who has been persuaded to vote  for  the three la , you know, what had they done to   
Oh they had to  to say who they supported and 
vote for the three, that's right  and there was one  one put their hand up for  he persuaded them that Ne , Neil Kinnock would be a good leader, that was it  er  so one put their hand up for him  one put their hand up for Major  and she had the cheek to say
that that is only because I'm a Conservative!
And it was supposed to be , if the audience was supposed to be voting  
 
and I mean  but the  quite  the majority of them  er  put their hands up for  Paddy Ashdown.
Yeah  he's a very persuasive   character 
Well when  and he wasn't on  he wasn't on, but he he at the  towards the end  they gave the three of them  thirty seconds to describe the go , you know, the qualities of  of the
Of a good leader.
of of of er  their leader
Mm.
and  the one  one for the Libs  he only used twenty seconds, twenty two seconds!
And he finished?
And, you know  he said  I'm sure Paddy Ashdown would think that you could of found something else  to use the other
To say.
eight seconds up !
But er  but  he ended up, you know  as sure as they've asked er the 
something to say 
the show of hands, like he was er  he was the one that the floating voters were
Yeah.
But 
I mean 
But only 
He, he looks a very persuasive kind of character doesn't he erm  I mean he's, he's quite sort of erm  well a nice person  well he 
Yeah.
seems to be!
But er 
But  you know 
Well see  wha wha down  there was a couple there in their leather jackets  look, looked a cli couple  you know, the boy and girl  couple of yobbos!
Looked a right couple of  yobbos And  er  well what day is it like?
Well he says er  how could you vote for Kinnock he says  because the press attacks him and he doesn't defend himself!
But your dukes up Neil!
You know!
Yeah, well 
And this is the mentality of them!
Childish!
I mean  ha  when it comes down to it, at the end of the day  today  we we live in  er a media orientated world don't we?
We turn on the box 
Well 
and we  we see what  is fed to us there, we pick up , you pick up the  you know, the comic strip papers  you know,yo you see headlines there, most of it is is  you know  Tory  sort of dominated.
Orientated.
But er  that  so it depends whether you, whether you actually think about what you're seeing and what you're reading and 
Well 
what you're hearing doesn't it?
Well I mean, I I take the Express
Mmmm.
and
they say that ad , it pays to advertise  I mean, to me advertising has never done  anything for me  well I don't think it has anyway  but if  it pays to advertise and look at  the number of people that read the Express
What do you want Lucy?
you know, the  that  would 
What?
convert a lot of people if they  
Oh yes!
definitely because it it is
No!
you know, I I I don't, I don't look at the first four pages in the Express  cos that's 
No.
all it is!
It's running Labour down
Yeah.
Same old stuff!
And  yeah.
Well in a 
and 
way
how good John Major is and how good
Mm.
and the Tory, you know  they're giving them victory because they they  supposedly we're we're up to the, up to as many er  we're level with the  with the Labour party now.
Mm.
And they are, you know, this is a victory!
Yeah  it's pathetic!
I I I think really they er  they forget that that there's a  quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not  and aren't all that easy  easily persuaded.
But, having said that  there is  but there are, but there as well!
No but I mean,the there's but there's a lot of people, you see  when you say they're not easily persuaded  that  are working class  that are voting Tory  and they're not easily persuaded they cha 
Well they did, I 
just changed their mind!
Mm.
Well  having  seen a little bit  erm  was on the other day and I I mean I  I must admit I touch  shut up you!
Nothing to do with you!
A lot of what's erm  you know, going on now, I mean, is just gonna go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind.
Yeah.
I'm a loyal supporter!
Well that's it!
And that's it!
But erm  you know o , I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same  a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who haven't  either don't really care
No!
or  they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about 
Yeah.
every party!
Yeah.
And making sure I get the right one.
But I think the majority of them just won't bother anyway, to watch
No.
they've already made their minds up  and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on  on basically the choice 
On the spur of the mom on the spur 
Well 
of the moment, on the day 
think well they've had long enough now we'll  we'll have a switch you know 
Or or the  they like the look of the bloke, they like his photograph
and they'll go and vote for him!
That's right.
And I mean there's that been that much  publicity about Neil Kinnock  you know, or anti  Neil 
Yeah.
Kinnock publicity.
But er, I mean a lot of people say ooh, you know, I wouldn't trust him with it!
And they didn't really know anything about the blooming bloke you know!
Well he's never been 
Of course not!
in power before well 
It's only what they've read in the newspaper!
Neither has  blooming John Major you know!
Neither has  blooming Maggie Thatcher before she came in, you know!
I mean it's 
Well I mean you've only got lo 
They'll be a first time  for everything !
You've got to take the way her
 Wack 
her image changed
Wack a wack a wack!
over the years
Mm, yeah.
the voice  the 
Mm.
shape of  the shape of her face and hair.
In fact I think that Spitting Image dummy was more like her than she was!
You you loo , you look 
Mhm.
at the years  how she changed, practically every year!
Her image changed.
Well  it started to become like er
A a little what do they call them?
These dolls.
Yeah.
What do they call them?
Barbie doll.
Barbie doll  and that's what she was.
Well no, not as attractive as a Barbie doll!
Well  no, but 
But 
I'm  but the style was there   
She,i it was  it was becoming like a dictatorship!
It was her at the helm
Ooh well this is what it beca , it did 
And 
and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli , all these MP's and what not which would comprise  parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time  you know i it really  their voices on the, on the  the cabinet  you know, they were, they were just destroyed!
Well, you said  you know you, we were on about Germany and, and becoming you know  could it happen again?
If  if she'd of had her way  she would of been the dictator of this 
Yeah.
country, and she would of been in power forever!
Oh I know!
You know that's, she would of been wanting to ma , make her life president or whatever it was!
I think she would of done with the Que , er done away with the Queen to get
Yes, I think there was a bit of competition on there wasn't 
Yeah.
there?
I'm convinced 
But 
she wouldould!
Yeah, I mean
If it meant her staying in power that, I mean she 
Well 
would of done it she would of got rid of them to make sure she  she stayed there.
Yes it came to er
Are you tired?
A fine state of affairs didn't it 
No, I'm alright Ken, yeah.
with her  even her own party  giving 
Well 
her the heave-ho!
Well this is it.
You know, I mean tha 
She was  they I mean she was go 
That's how it must be.
she was going too far for them
Well
she must of been.
well this is it  I think she was beginning to endanger her chances of re-election and I think 
Yeah.
they let her go on too long and it
Well to be but er 
And er 
but they did let her go on too long!
I mean it's turned into a bit of a joke now really 
Yes it has.
hasn't it?
You know, our policies are working, I mean after thirteen years
Well they've had long enough to do it!
And this recession that we've been coming out of for so many years now it's  I mean it's just turned into a bit of a joke!
They're all making money for themselves aren't they?
That's why I'm suspicious 
Well 
of the Labour party!
Well
The Labour party?
No, I don't
The big shots you know!
Money in the bank
No I don't   
Well 
Whe whe when they're small they're Ken 
I, I  
but once they get a
Well ah now  what have I said to you  ?
Para power corrupts I know.
Mm Mm, yes.
And that's the way power corrupts.
But, well it's what I've just said!
Yeah but I mean 
That's true.
you'd never agree with before!
No you we , you was  relating it to  to  power in this country to any country and saying 
Any country.
it was exact, identical.
Well it is.
And that's what I  disagreed with.
It is.
I I said 
It is  
you can't compare the ca , the power like just say  in a place like Turkey  which is absolutely rotten!
They got no law at all, or very little  with, with the 
Well it's corruption!
Ooh yeah!
I mean, if a little kid in the in the 
And that is, that is what  
in the in the playground er
Well that's what it amounts to!
You know
It's corruption!
coerces some kid into selling him his marbles, that's corruption isn't it?
But there are levels aren't there?
One  one is more 
 
extreme than the other.
So we've got corruption in us probably  so it depends upon the degree 
Well, yes we have.
but you don't expect to get out of the ruddy 
Aha.
Socialist Party!
Because 
Why not?
Because I said to yo , I said to you that it was the same in Russia!
And how much corruption have you discovered in the Socialist Party?
The Labour Party?
Have I discovered?
You mean have I seen 
Well how much ?
on the television
Yeah.
these people that
Well what do you 
talk with two tongues and say 
Well what do you know about them that you say they've 
Yes.
they've got er 
What do you base your i , your  
What happens when they retire?
Well what happens when they retire?
Do they end up  working the way we've got to bloody work  here  on this tiny pension  or the pension that they've earned as an MP 
Well  have retired from the Labour 
Well alright 
Party.
Harold Wilson, prime example
Yeah.
rich man!
Lord Wilson
Yeah.
socialist, I mean
Well how da , how do you know what ?
They're supposed to be against all that aren't they?
Wait a minute!
How do you know he's a rich man  and what do you class  what do yo , what do you base in rich ?
Well a man that's got more than one home for a start!
Yeah.
Well er 
Because that's erm
You must have been rich then  a couple of years ago?
When you brought a second home!
Now don't talk ru , you know what I'm on about!
No, I don't, no!
I don't mean a bloody home like that!
No,
Er, wait a minute Ray!
He's he's, he's lead a public life
Mm.
so he can write  he can write a few books, he can go out there and talk
Mhm.
So he earns money, is that a, is that a corruption of his job?
No, well  talking to earn money, no!
Do you agree?
Yo , I mean
If he er, if he gets paid by 
It's the same 
the hour.
It is the sa , it is the sa , it is the same as Maggie Thatcher going to America now 
Course it is!
And she's 
Yeah.
pa , and she's paid half a 
Well i 
million pounds for her  
Well tha that that is 
Yeah.
worse isn't it?
So I mean, er I dunno 
But it's it's the degree 
  
How can that how can that man as a socialist  justify earning  well I don't know what he gets, but we'll say he doesn't 
Well 
get as much as Thatcher, say he gets  forty thousand
Well no, I didn't know  no you don't  
Oh, now wait a, wait a minute!
Now I, I have said to, I have said to you 
He's a rich man 
that everybody 
and he shouldn't be!
everybody should earn the same.
 
Mm.
But you all said  that it depends on his skill or his what's his name
Or how many kids he's got.
If I've got twenty five kids and you've only got one yo , I need more than you!
So how can you possibly all earn the same?
Why not?
Well you wouldn't have enough would you, to su sustain all those 
Yeah.
kids?
Why?
You'd have to get enough to live on.
I can't see that!
I mean er
No, I can't see the argument!
Well, to me you shouldn't have twenty five kids anyway!
Well that's dictatorship 
Because because it, I would have a dictatorship on that!
I mean that's, I would have 
Well that's, alright well  well that's 
control of the world population, I se 
I would limit to two children.
I would er, have control of the 
That's another argument!
world population.
Well fair enough!
But 
Yeah.
that is another argument!
It is, we're on the road .
That is er, that would mu , that would be my first priority.
Oh !
I thought your first one was everyone getting 
I'm not go 
the same pay!
Yes, so everybody 
So 
would need the same pay.
But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever 
No, but I mean  I mean 
there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts  because people would manage money differently 
Differently 
some would spend it
Of course they would!
as soon as they get it 
Oh yeah.
some would go into hock  and spend it before they get it 
before they got it yeah.
some would save it, and be frugal!
Alright, alright then  
Which is what the Tories want you see  
What I want 
I think the trouble is 
I want 
no, you're defending them!
I won't give anybody any money  you can go to the shop and buy what you basically need.
You see yo 
No but we're devia 
your 
we're deviating on the subject 
well you did  because your, straight away you go onto money  which is our God isn't it?
Well, no but you said it was corruption
Yeah.
and I've only yo mentioned, well you mentioned money because you mentioned Harold Wilson
Mm.
with two homes  and you said the money they get!
Yes.
So you brought the subject of the money up!
No, no 
Mm.
but you're on about something else, you said the first thing I'd do, that's got nothing to do with Harold Wilson  the first thing I if I were in power
But there would 
which 
be like I 
Yeah.
say, we're deviating on the 
Yeah.
subject!
no no no but I'm pa if 
So go on yo 
I were in power there wouldn't be any money  no need for it!
Then you 
Well I 
wouldn't have all 
I 
the arguments!
I know that!
So you wouldn't
Yeah.
say that at all!
No.
Yeah.
And what would you do 
But in the case of these people that  start off 
So why why should 
Fair do's they start off in University, clever blokes  and a lot of them worked in the mines, Shinwells  what's his name?
Beven  miners 
Just for money!
Well I won't say  Beven  because it's a bloody shame what happened to him!
But never the less  a lot of them started off like that didn't they?
Another one is Foot.
Ah but er he 
And  as they get into, as you say, power and I quite agree  somebody has a talk with them so look here
We know
we know you're a socialist
But you still earned a few bob to get on.
But er, you you we're gonna make you a nice one and join the bloody club  so you'll be  an armchair socialist  and we look after you  and that's what they are!
Callaghan is another example  two or three homes  big Jim with all his bloody money what does he care about working people?
And this feller Kinnock's the same, you can see the style of them!
I think he must be  
Bloody big cuffs!cufflinks!
I think you  I think you've been saying  
Ah well, no not  
Saville Row shirts!
No, you're making him it's 
I think if you 
mistake, you're making a mistake there!
as the leader of the Labour Party or the Liberal Party 
You have got to keep up with you've gotta keep up with 
to go 
image  and how to be 
Yeah.
a leader in this country!
No, you haven't!
You can't expect, yes you have!
Foot never did!
You have!
Michael Foot?
What did he, what where did it get him?
Well you just said you just go you just said you've gotta give them a 
How long did it last?
How long did it how long did it last?
Are you, are telling  are you telling me that you'd vote for somebody in rags on the television who promised you a better future?
I did!
What do you mean you did?
Voted for Foot.
Who did you sa , oh!
You sod!
You did not!
And he was never in power anyway!
He was, he was the Prime Minister!
Oh he was 
Well!
not!
He was never the Prime 
He wasn't, Michael Foot?
Oh I know he put  in there.
Oh no he
He should of been.
He's never been president of  
He was very outspoken he was a very outspoken 
He should of been!
He was leader of the  
But the first 
 
bloody  only the  the way they should dress!
Ah, yes well ah, that's got nothing to do with it!
Oh!
But now it has!
I mean he's probably got more money than they've bloody got!
The  it's all a blind anyway those rags he goes round in!
Duffel coat, he got he got censored 
There's 
because he wore a duffel coat instead  
Well it's like 
That man underneath a duffel coat  
What did Ken  say about this chap from Vauxhalls?
 Convena did all his work  and they asked him to go to London  you know, there's some was on years ago  so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just couldn't believe it, he turned on him and said  you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said!
Those lads down there they're fighting  living on their ruddy  strike pay  and look at you lot!
He said they were there the whisky was flowing  you know hypocrites!
And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good 
Well 
time you know.
on your argument then  anybody who  who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top  has gotta become corrupted!
That's what you're saying, no ma 
Well if there i if there in a 
no matter who, no matter what !
If they're in a corrupt society  and when they get to that position they  they don't do anything about it and accept 
Well they 
it and take 
they don't 
the bribes, well yes I agree this is the 
Yeah.
the 
Yeah.
basis of the mafia isn't it?
Ah, you see if  if you don't, I mean  it's not, it doesn't happen in, in every walk of life  but in big business and in politics  if you don't
You have to modify your  
I'll tell you , I'll tell you how 
No, no if you don't tow the line 
 
Exactly!
If you just don't 
if you'd be elected 
Yes  and you don't modify you  what happens?
You don't get anywhere!
You don't get elected which is what happened 
Well 
to the Labour government 
No 
last time!
oh well, oh well apart apart from being 
No.
elected
fifty percent of the population
apart from that 
wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the  Labour government didn't get in  on that basis  so they had to modify their  and I mean as  
Well you can use that for any argument then 
But I mean but what what 
can't you?
what I want
Do everything the tories do because we're not gonna get in!
Well 
Well well no I mean it's not 
Well that's what they've bloody done near enough!
 
Well yeah!
And another thing that I  fifty thousand 
The, they   it's a  
Mean time all the vil , all the  mines are closing are they gonna say well yes well
Well well we've gotta do that because  be be being practical.
Well I think it's a very being short sighted thing to do to erm 
Well I I think I think you'll find that well if Labour  gets in 
I mean it's  
they will, they will scra , they would find that most of the 
I hope they'll rescind that.
mos , they wo , they wouldn't rescind it.
 
 
What the mines?
Yes.
They wouldn't close them.
The closure of the mines.
No!
I think
Well they can't close the ones that's already 
Don't you think so?
gone in eight 
Oh!
nineteen eighty one can they?
They've 
Oh I know!
gone!
Closed!
Well 
Yeah but I'm, I I know I don't  
Well some of them certainly 
And they closed one the other week that's flooded now 
will definitely  
so that's 
Yeah.
I don't think that this 
They, they won't they they wouldn't 
can't rescind that!
they wouldn't bring 
But I 
money on the mining  
And that goes for a lot of businesses!
I mean, there's enough coal  in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years!
Yeah!
And that could possibly be the only, and ah  I mean it's it's a
Ah but
it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on  
Well I've no doubt in twenty 
I mean 
years time the tories will re-open them 
much  it's it's far 
at at great cost to us!
Ah but you see 
Nothing to stop them!
that  it's 
Well 
very short sighted to get rid of that now!
I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad  so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it  and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up 
I know  I know
and we can't them any more?
Well
You know we , very well what'll 
but what happen 
happen!
When, when that market's been pruned 
alright 
down and the only 
what happen 
place you can get it but the price is !
What happened in nineteen eighty one?
They're so short sighted!
What did Bob say about the miners?
When, you know when that strike was on  but it's  like a lot of people
What did he say about the 
Ooh that 
teachers?
bloody lot of, bloody 
 
lot of clowns!
Arthur Scargill  bloody clown!
Now 
Yeah.
those fellers fought to keep those mines open  and they got one of lot miners divided and said oh bugger them!
The fellers in the Midlands was it?
Yeah.
Yo er  Notin 
Yes.
Nottingham round there?
St. Helens
Ooh bloody no
 Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa 
and they ploughed twenty five million into their mines and said your jobs are guaranteed now fore , forget it you know, you're alright for thirty years what .
Now they're closing the bloody things!
Now, you know we sho something should of happened then  they should of prolonged that strike  to destroy these buggers and said no you're not gonna close them!
But the peop lot of people agreed with it!
Well of course!
They said they weren't being 
But 
realistic!
what do they do, they divide and conquer Ray!
Yeah but why should bloody intelligent people go along with it Ken?
That's what gets my plate!
Because they , because the intelligent people weren't involved!
No I mean, I'm talking about the people  who are not actually  er, you know 
I i if 
concerned directly but give 
But 
their approval  for these 
But they're 
people.
they're not involved, the people  the people that give their approval are the people that want it!
And I mean er, and 
Yeah but I mean 
and also  they, they get the masses on their side by the media!
I know!
The same as they're 
Exactly!
doing now with the  I mean  what paper have you got?
I know, well there you are!
A Labour paper!
This is what terrifies me!
And what's, what's er  what's your chance?
The Mirror.
Where's that ball gone?
Yes.
Bring that ball here!
You got no bloody chance!
But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel!
And you never hear the Labour party criticising.
You know, but they should be  criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't!
Well when when  if if the Labour party criticised  and they do criticise
Oh they criticise Ken, yeah.
The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on  and you see it happening on the parliament  and on your papers.
Well you read your paper don't you?
And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer 
We we'll watch 
which is, they get some  they do some pretty good
But how often do the  I mean, they  they don't give you  they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week!
Oh no they're  or there's certain ar 
they only pick
a certain subject or 
Yes.
whatever that's been thrashed.
As you say , we'll see.
Well  he's gone on  seven days of the week  complaining about so and so  we'll just narrow that down to one article about his  his complaint that they may just make a little note  he's complained seven times about this!
So you see a little article 
That's right.
he's not complaining!
Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example 
 
the low wages
Yeah.
we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France  I in 
Yes.
Italy.
Well yes.
Oh there we go, that was mistake number one  George dear have you read the er holiday page at all?
No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about
Oh I'm not sure
 

the
Oh dear
places you can go to
Mm
which is a fallacy
I thought it was Barry  there, he looked a bit like him.
No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy.
E T get down, down.
Down there, there's a good boy
If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice  if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it  you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are.
in the U K  mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping
Joking aren't you camping?
Well that's just what it looks like here  you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night 
Oh we're back in France again are we?
Mm
Yes 
well 
Oh I see, yeah, yes it's
Mm 
It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol
Well for us I mean it's
and then the ferry across 
it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast
Yes
but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel
Oh yes I think so  a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us?
Yes I did mentioned it erm
Did you to Ken?
Well you were there weren't you too?
I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether
We didn't come into it
Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details.
Well this was erm Bulgaria
Yes, yes
Mm
but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in.
I certainly wouldn't coach it  so  I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days.
Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you?
Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to  to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time 
Yeah 
cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean  I'm not particularly bothered whether
comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his 
Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him 
Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he?
But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility 
Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming?
Italy
Did they?
Yes Florentine
or near Venice
That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there
Yes
that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to 
What they got 
afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage 
Yes that's a point 
so, you know
that's a point, yeah
so unless erm
even if we 
tell us we 
went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we?
Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it?
And it's only an hour or so away, so  perhaps you should say that
get a weekend in 
 

I wonder where there is a cheap place to
where you can old furniture.
Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored 
No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture
Oh no 
all furniture 
you've got no chance
mm.
No I mean, what is he, different
in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is
Oh there yes, no I meant in this country
Not on par with ours is it?
I don't think, I don't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find.
Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any
A lot, yeah
from southern Italy at all do you?
Oh you see a lot of them from erm
Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's 
paediatric coast don't you?
farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them.
You see them for Rome don't you?
Not very often, not in here
Is it tours?
Not very often, not really
Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm
mm, what's the other one?
Catonica
Is it Rimini?
Rimini, Catonica all on the
coast, which is er the Black Polish isn't it?
yeah
 

mm  there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet.
Oh yes the
Erm
the very big lady 
er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled
Gosh
Sounds drastic doesn't it?
does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it
Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she didn't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er
But I still like
either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still doesn't lose weight 
I still like to know how they staple it.
Yeah  yes, I don't think you er you can measure I don't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er
It must be an operation or
Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person isn't it?
Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples  must be
Mm she was, what, what are you doing?
Stop it
sounds a bit drastic
Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation  presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to  stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a 
On the concept yep 
more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the
but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat 
That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise 
you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there?
Yes it's er 
I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales 
Oh yes 
Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer?
No
They're not very flattering  they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid  I think er  you tried to get away from the traditional type of
Oh I see these one that they send in
Mm
Yes I er 
by the thousands 
I don't go a lot on them myself
Oh poetry   some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad.
Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name
about the gas and that
Oh to be honest I can't remember the
Mm, very poignant
Mm, but er
anti war
what was the one about the erm  oh  it was about the assembling of the gun
Oh yes, oh 
 
do you remember that?
And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts
That's right yes
and er
Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now
Mm
horrible.
There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs
Mm 
which are supposed to be erm 
Come here
seventeenth century
come here scallywag
They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually
Mm
you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on
and the guy that's faked it has done all this
as he thought, authenticate it
What, what they call it, stressing it don't they?
Stressing it, yeah stressing it
Mm
and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable
contortionist, it says here
oh 
Mm 
but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of 
Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish
Yeah
which it turned out to be wax
Oh
to simulate old varnish you see?
Oh
So then he started looking
Yeah
They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers
Yeah  I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that.
I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in
beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future  you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's
things that are in there, it's astronomical.
Mm, quite expensive as you say 
Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right  oh he said that heaven
Mm
yeah, you do  huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?
Yes  mm 
Did you read this erm review about Ruby Wax?
No I haven't read that yet
She's is a, quite a
character actually, mind you she does er, it looks like one of those programmes you know er, when you don't want to be sitting in the front row, if she's going to
Mm pick on you 
single, single you out for attention  she say erm,Miss Wax who likes to think of herself now principally as a writer,the comic talents of this calendar who needs laxative.
Come on E T, come on babe, come on, do you want to go out?
Go out?
Wait a sec, let me get my  yeah wait a sec, let me get my coat  ah, down  stay down, good boy  come on, OK, OK, you're going now, yes .
Taking for walkies Margaret.
Mm, mm, yes
Are you coming?
Well if I take him you can do the veg if you like  get down
I see, I'd just thought you'd might like to go.
Well I will but I doubt this, oh god I've got heap of things to do 
Right lassie
You wanna go to the shops now or what?
You're going are you?
Yes 
What's that?
Do you need to come or
Well, I think all I need is bread really isn't it?
So I
Mm
I'll keep an eye, spend your money.
E T won't hurt you.
Hello there, this guy is that nervous honestly, he loves other dogs, but er, they seem to frightened him, you know, he's a, till he gE Ts to know them then his OK, you know?
E T, come on, he's only young your chap isn't he?
Yeah
Yeah
I've got two of them, the other one's er cut himself on a bottle this morning, he's been in the vE T all day, he's just had 
Oh no 
his leg stitched up.
Fixed him up alright?
Yeah.
Mm, how'd he manage that?
I don't know he just somebody must of 
They just 
left a broken bottle
clean cut right down the bone
Oh god
so, he's out of commission for a couple of weeks.
Yes, it's er infection really isn't it?
Yes
And if he's anything like this guy he's all go 
Oh yes he's just like him
E T will you give over, come on
You don't lE T them do you?
It's a bit 
He was ill treated you know, and he was
Yeah
we got him from the rescue, animal rescue you know 
Oh yeah 
so he's a pa , he's a bag of nerves really, but er, most of the time he's great, but,I think your, your one's a bit too boisterous for him 
Well enough.
Take care anyway,come on E T 
That's right, yeah, yeah.
Oh he said er
Oh that's not so bad you see I've been on holiday all last week
Oh, where you been?
I haven't been away, but I've been off work like 
Oh just, oh I see 
so er
holiday at home?
Yeah called me in two days so they gave me today and tomorrow off as well, so it's sort of gone longer than I expected you know?
Mm, mm 
I'm off tomorrow as well.
Well it's always nice to be at home isn't it?
Please yourself 
Get down, get down oh yeah, yeah.
I got through quite a few bits and pieces that was
Have you?
All the jobs you've been meaning to do
Yeah, yeah
Yes I know
Hello there
Good afternoon
how's the family?
Abnormal
Yeah   At one time we couldn't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and
I noticed the little girl with her, yes.
She waved as she came towards me and she said oh can't stop today
Huh
said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever  said I'm in a hurry  then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er
Who you don't know from Adam
A spaniel  which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T
Off the lead like?
Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide 
 
then he was watching him like this then he ran
Away from it or
ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know
I said he  he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one 
Spaniel , yeah.
he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning  on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches 
Stitches 
so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know
Mm
stop him getting dirt 
keep going 
in it or whatever
Yeah 
Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to
I saw Mr Bentley
Mm.
and er he hasn't got any stuff there of course 
No.
but er, he said oh try the guy
Try?
the chap in Mold, whatever his name is
Robert .
I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well 
Mm.
so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the
Yes I thought he probably would.
You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you?
I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over.
Mm, I don't think so  but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all 
Nobody's interested no, it's a shame 
said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er 
Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the 
Yes 
What is it?
What do they call it that hall?
Hawkesbury hall
Hawkesbury hall, yes 
by the school, yeah 
but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be 
Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe.
Is it?
Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it
Oh oh they've just locked 
but er 
locked it up because er
he said they've er
So did she say she could get some?
Or
Said she'll ask, said she knows she's got
giving an errand to take out to the place you know because er if 
Well it's dangerous stuff to handle I suppose
Mm
but as you say wanted a tiny amount anyway so
it's a joke isn't it?
you know
Mm
several of us at college 
oh well she'll know by tomorrow night, you could her a call 
you would think 
tell me that much
Which pub?
at the college?
well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there?
Well that's the thing yeah
You multiple that by 
getting in a little bit 
however many there are
There's about six I think
Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ain't he?
Even so, yeah
So er 
Oh they've probably got this much you know
mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that 
he, he got 
or are you 
Oh I 
just taken it in out of the book?
No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us
Oh
said the stuff you're using is
Rubbish
old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off?
Mm
You know
that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing?
And that, and this, you kept getting this er
Oh no you, you can use this, but you 
oil through 
don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that.
Oh
His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can
Mm
put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet
So just use wax to build up the polish
waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see
Mm
but you can
that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to
Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in?
That's already done innit?
Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about 
He started just after me, yeah 
one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the
I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards  that'll be each one of those holes, he 
He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the
yes
or 
well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand
he will
but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that
Oh easily
concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it?
Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water 
And water 
erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole
Yes
so if you just put the 
well 
the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere
Yeah
I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it?
Where's little tiddly gone?
Where is he by the way?
Erm I said to you he's on the settee 
Hello, hello, hello 
if he's on there just shout at him will you because
oh he's in here
he's by the radiator aren't you beaut?
He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you?
Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is  it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it.
I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes
one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document
Yeah 
to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along
Personally I would of
Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it?
Well acetic acid is you know the chemical
you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see
Oh
which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that 
oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it?
You're only, you only 
Well you only put 
putting that much in
Oh
in this, in like a pint
Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you?
That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon
Mm
and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon.
Which chemist did you go to?
Bob's
Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see
Aye
get in your basket this minute
I thought, I thought the other one had got it 
go on , go on.
When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box 
Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah
you don't see erm doing this  but, well after that, I mean 
and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose
they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or 
Mm 
bottles of
already, ready mix
There's a jar already done, you just pour it in
Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they?
You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it?
Ninety percent probably
The erm you get 
The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and
Yeah
which are all, er what they called?
I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they?
Oh their own, yes
I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty  so
where you do it
so well where you gonna go for that?
Where else can you try?
Er well I was gonna ask for
when he comes, gonna ask or ask
At the college do you mean?
They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area  and
the chemist
Mm
he's an old fashioned type
Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean
He's bloody finished now
Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than
to get it, I mean he's very obliging.
He lives over the shop still doesn't he?
Or at the back of the shop.
He's a proper character isn't he?
Mm
But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think
a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out
Look in the pockets you great pi , oh
I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you
Oh jesus, Maggots  I caught a few
there might be a fiver in one of them
You've got no chance of that
Hey did you know this
Yes  oh god  Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud.
I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they?
Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow  go on  I want to put those lupins in
today, somewhere  never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you  Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash 
Right I'm going to work in the workshop
I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it.
You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it?
Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two 
Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop?
Or
No.
Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it?
Let's turn that down
Can't turn it out.
Power isn't it?
Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you?
I don't know
Use your
Fantastic that
pause 
I'm looking for something somewhere   Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh  Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you  it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a
No
See how she goes.
Erm
Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them
Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood.
Possibly have
stones
You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the
 

Oh  I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for
enough
Mm, and it 
the nails in the wood that's all
Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that?
Eleven or twelve wasn't he?
Near that 
Say this er I think
mm
 

 

Have you actually got a plan drawn up with measurements, devised to the top and the base as well or are you going to do that when you
I got the height of the base, you've seen that
yes, yes
Use that for the base obviously 
Muffin be quiet, what the devil's wrong with him?
it's that much bigger so, you know just see how the top one goes and then I can copy that to the bottom
Yeah, well you're going to do the base of it bigger aren't you?
Yes
Erm
er the only, I'm not quite sure yet how the sides are going to 
and the door , the glass door he wanted it erm like the lead glass, oh similar to these
Yes I know he wants it erm
you know
glazing bars
Mm
there's no way we could use it either of those, panels that were the glass panels that we've got in the garage, no, separate them, I mean it,
they're not, they're not solid glass, they're two panes, which could be separated whether of ingenuity and
What re-cut you mean?
Well no not, not, well we could get them, I never thought of that
Cut them they wouldn't be the exact size
yes, ah that's a point now, I could take them down to erm, what's his name  down the road and ask him, he's very obliging, ask him to cut them 
I don't know it depends er 
I was just thinking rather than having plain which you'd have to pay for anyway a plain piece of glass and, and er putting lead on it yourself  I think that's a brilliant idea that.
Well the idea is, is it's not so much the lead
it suppose to be the
bars, I don't know what they look like without
old, old er
 
it's a diamond , it's a diamond pattern isn't it for
Yeah
as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet  have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all?
No there's some there
Cooked?
oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm
what do you
erm 
Are you gonna left that battery on
well, well only temporarily, I only want this
it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to
right erm, just erm
It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging
oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no?
Do you think so?
Just down the bottom
Just down the bottom 
Right  what you're going to have to do is erm
Get a piece of wood with a nail in it
Yeah, yeah
I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it.
I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it?
Er, well, put it on the floor
 

Go in your basket go on
Yes, I cannot give it much more
re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom
So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you?
Those four
Mm
to that section of the
oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say
it wouldn't split in half went for it and
 
Twelve inches across are they?
That way
They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall.
Wouldn't Sue do them?
She hasn't got a
hasn't she?
I bet she had, I bet she had er
no I know she's got a
You really want one with a three 
I thought she had a band saw no
I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you?
And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you?
Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there
 
huge, to that their costs mm
I'll have to pay
mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw
thirty pound a tooth
Yeah, god worse than
erm
mm, how many have you got to now cut?
and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there?
I haven't got anything that deep, the
only goes to about five inches
What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you
No
Why?
at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off
To reverse them
and turn it over
Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way
To make your first cut
Yeah
you have to take the guard off and the
knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm  where's the guard goes at the top
Mm
just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down
Mm
cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see
Yeah without a guard on it 
without a guard and they won't 
mm, mm
allow that on this stand
No I can understand that I suppose
but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing 
Something to grip it, mm 
We would have to like pull the wood through you see
what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to  Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er
Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know 
don't think you'd be very happy you know
I mean you wouldn't wanna pay  no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth
Damaging them, saw, mm
Well at least we've had a look at the whether we
right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we?
Well I mean 
What are you gonna do?
I don't know
It's impossible to do by hand 
No not impossible
with a good saw
Yeah
and about ten irish navvies
One down below and one above huh
mm 
Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the  they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like  I made the cab some cabinets you know.
I want them split down that road
Which way?
On the deep
Oh on the deep
two or three gorges
Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic
That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and
Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep  
I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new.
I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean?
Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you?
But
Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er
I
the sides are coming out er like this you see
those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those
I, I like them
but, but I haven't got enough you see
Yeah
but er
you won't get two that size will you?
You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two
it is a good er about one and five eighths
Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there 
Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of 
Yeah, yeah 
here you see and it'll all be joined up.
It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down
Mm, they're not really safe
Yeah,
a band saw are you now are you?
I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it
Yeah
or something like that.
I know they don't like it
No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos
Oh hello
Hello Margaret, well 
twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to
and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in
Most of them don't do their own now do they?
No
We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop
I
when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away
Yeah it's a
I don't fancy doing by hand
Well, even that little one of mine
No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before
You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know
Yes, yes, oh yes
and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and
and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree
they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade
Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah
that's right, yeah
I think
bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day
Yeah, yeah
How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know?
I don't know
It must of had a good iron in it.
Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me
Yeah and I used to see them many a times in
and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least?
Oh I, yeah 
They'd take a long time to dry wouldn't they, then, on the sticks and that
stacks of it
and my father was in the woods before the war and they, he, he looked after the woods and cut the trees down and everything and then they were sent to
Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see 
Slowly to dry it was always as, as he went up to about a
for pupation, yeah
I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart
Oh yes
used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it
yes
must of had a knife or something to it, sliced wasn't it?
Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub
Nice to see there, there was a certain way of cutting the tree 
this is going back 
to get the figure into it
I, a cut
on the diagonal
Yes
you see, a diagonal, the
raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak,
Yeah
but expensive that was
yeah that's right
cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in
Yeah
this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced
Yeah
because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard 
I wouldn't of thought so, it was
I wouldn't of thought so
the
I'll have to find out of this
where, where I found more so were
that's the oldest part isn't it?
That's the oldest part
That's right on the knife
and the er
whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer
and the awkward thing was to hack a wood in the centre
Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah
An American oak is not too bad
But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish
Mm
and it's just only because of the climate, there's er
Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was?
That's right, yeah, he's, he's
Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here
this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway
Oh yeah
as a joiner
Yeah
and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful
Yeah
the er
all the
knots, very few knots, just lovely yellow pine and er and they make all their furniture out of these pieces, so, he said that's what set me off on making furniture he said
say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous
ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on
Yeah
a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there.
It's happening everywhere you see.
You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er
we, we didn't know what was going to happen
that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now.
One of them said er
when they start bringing the
yes, yes that's right, lower
lowering the taxes
Everybody come here, this is the place to run a big business
Yeah
cheap labour
Yeah
you can fiddle all you want, get away with it, er
I
Well Nor you can't help me on this me old son
Er
it's a shame really, no he bought about erm
I'm not even gonna volunteer to do
about erm ten of these and then the head
So apart from those three we said what else is there Ma 
No, well he's got a catalogue and we can send
No, that, that catalogue he had I rang them and he 
 
sent me one
Beeswax was it?
Pure beeswax, what else?
I bet that was a 
It was pure restoration materials
Yes
I've forgotten now
I'm sure that's where he said he got it from the
wax
He said he got his waxes fifteen years ago and he's still using them
Oh
I think he gets all his stuff from that guy at, he got the brochure didn't he from somewhere up North?
Yes, well Molly's just said she's rung them 
Well yeah, well I've got the brochure 
Oh
I rang them up, it's, it's Bolton, but they don't do
wax, they do all the other waxes 
Bury isn't it?
Well I'd try Time and
Bury the one?
They caught , I don't, yeah actually
the address I had
Yes.
Oh well I'll, I'll look, I'll ring I didn't actually ring 
I'll find out anyway 
them up and ask them 
and actually you know this Time Chemicals, they, they deliver you know, they come here with the stuff.
Do they?
Just ring them up, oh yeah, they go anywhere.
What is the recipe I 
Bury ,, Bury
Mm
That's a good one isn't it, dear me, that's er
Oh no, but, they, they will post it
Post it, but then they're gonna charge aren't they?
Oh yeah
VAT and for a small amount it's not worth it really
One of the dogs gone down there?
I am sick and tired of picking up the mud 
Hello Ken 
Oh, we're trying to see if any pick up the nails in the wall, you know 
 
those boards trying to get them split down you see to make some, you know, shelves and that
No, not really
Does it work?
It's got the battery in it 
Well I'm not sure really it didn't seem to go to good on the cast iron nails you know the long ones
Yeah
It's alright on the on the erm 
Well I don't know until the, when it comes to college you've got a hand one
That's what I was gonna say
Yeah it's a, it must be a sensitive one you see
but er
Yeah
But erm, not reliable enough on that anyway
So anyway Norm mentioned about going to this one at erm Old Tammy, that one on the Old Road
Yeah
he said try there, they've got some old wood he said, well perhaps they're used to cutting all stuff
Oh
oh dear then you will be
whether you'll get that rate
You're not very choosy
money for them sort of things
Yeah
that's the way I look at it.
There's no other way 
 
No, no, no, he does so many days Ken
Is he full time or what?
What?
Is who full time?
He can't be full time otherwise he wouldn't have enough to do would he?
I don't know perhaps he does, I don't actually know Ken, I thought the way he was talking though that this chap 
No, it's, it's so many days that they work innit?
had actually taken him on that he used to know years ago and had finished the
Oh he's finished the
I know it's a couple of years ago before he came here
Oh
but this chap he's known for years
mention the name
he gave him a job, er
erm, but I mean I, I was given to believe he was full time he never said oh it's so many days
cost I think that
Let's have a look
Now there's this place up, remember that
 
French polish 
it's got a big order 
right, erm , where's this beeswax?
They're all in one together
er
It's the same one, is it, are the, is that an update?
That's the different prices 
Oh these are, I see, yes, yes, yes
 

Brunches, no, ah it'd be a
That's three seventy eight for five hundred grammes, and five hundred grammes is just over a pound.
Five oh, oh that's not bad.
It is low, it's a pound and a tenth 
It can't be right fourteen pound a pound can it?
That's wrong
A kilo's five fifty
Perhaps he meant five hundred pounds you think or whatever
Don't know
erm
a mahogany cost so much more 
a mahogany, oh gee whiz 
Yeah
but she said that they were the same price
Oh no
but erm,
she's got mixed up
good grief what is that I wonder?
I don't know, fifty pence
 
gee, grief, that's six times as much , you'd have to have something for brown stains wouldn't you, you couldn't just use them er hand like, but, but is brown mind you but erm 
Pittance
What about the erm,be you know beeswax, beeswax have you got that?
yeah it's in here
There you are, oh that's a
one that's made up
Here we are
Oh yes
I said the grey colour is alright
That's the one we want is it?
Yeah
That's half a kilo, six eighty 
but we found that the yellow was purified, you know, it's, it's 
What about the oth the erm , what is it the pure
beeswax
He just says beeswax doesn't he in his
yeah yellow beeswax 
Yellow is it?
I see, yes, yes
er and, and what about the paraffin?
And the paraffin ones , little colour
That's cheap
Yeah
Oh well  oh well I think that er would be a good proportion to er Morell's, but then we got to, anyway, excuse me I must go somewhere.
Hello you Lucy-woosy, hello there Lucy-woosy, yeah, ooh, you're a lovely girl you  oop
Right I want all that lot cut up for
Right so all you need is a good saw and a ha , ten Irish navvies.
Ah I done this 
I said 
I said to Norm I cut some walnut not, not that long of course from the deep 
Did he do it?
He didn't do it
No, no
He, he had a lot of machinery actually years ago he, before he moved here he sold 
Oh Norm yes at his old place, he had er 
He sold er most of it 
three machines a great big saw and 
because he didn't have the room for it here 
and all this but er 
he had a 
business
 

Well when he had it 
He's got a lot to do now you see
when you've done it all, I suppose you could get a bit further with his
yeah but he's got to the stage now as if yeah he's not gonna do a lot, whatever he did before at home I'm not sure but er he's done all his windows and stuff like that but I think then again he can do a lot at work you see.
Yeah
Cutting and all this
Yeah
there's the machine, he done it, bring it home and assemble it so, not too much on the heavy side.
Yeah, but I mean he's done all his windows hasn't he, he's adapted all his windows from that er
Yeah, oh yeah
from that frame he's bought, so he's done quite well really
Yeah  eh we could have a
ah?
with you underneath
I'll hold the saw, I wouldn't push it
oh one of those pits yeah  
There's no need for the pits, we can have a series of trestle
Yeah
out in the fresh air and have to
Yeah
had to blow the dust off you
I
well, and Margaret could even go 
Yes, I'm good at that
every time I done the down stroke
Yes
Sounds a bit 
like that idea?
Eh?
Do you like that?
I like that idea of that, but er get somebody else underneath 
Get another volunteer
Yeah
Dogs
get the dogs
there's a system there with a, a bone, every time you move that you'd move a bone and they'd go down
They'd have to go down to the
the one on the top
they keep pulling back up, you wouldn't have to strained any energy going back up 
Have you got your grandchildren Easter eggs yet chaps?
Er, I sent some money down for Bethan and Kaylie
Yeah
er
I just wondered if you'd remember, you know 
 
when I sent Bethan her birthday card down there, I sent some money for her
Yeah
and I sent some money for, but I mentioned it to Peter
Yeah
before they went back, and er, I can't remember whether I told them to get one or whether they should be up for Easter.
Well they could, they're moving up here aren't they
Yeah, so
time, so 
I tell you what I can't do, I can't find, I can't find Charles' birthday on me calendar
Oh, well I said
This is the other thing you've got to start remembering innit Marg?
when we were at Carrie's at the weekend I said you must tell me all the birthdays again, because I can't find them.
I don't even remember to look at the calendar
Oh well, I, I, I mean I, my mind, my memory is going I know, but I, but I look at that and I turn it over each month and I have a look at I have an idea what's
What's coming up that month.
Once you've got to do it, then you do it
Good idea actually
but if you leave it to somebody else well you never done.
Well I'm, I'm the same, I was talking to Rob the other day and er, I forget how I mentioned it, but I said something about, oh I think it's because I was saying why don't you come up like this week because he's off this week, and er, he was making some excuse or other, oh I've got three weeks off in the summer, oh I'd sooner come up when I've got this longest spell off, you know, and I want to get this chimney done and blah, blah
Hope he's not coming for three weeks
so I said something about last week, you see, and I could of, it was my birthday last week and, but er, and I carried on, he said oh go , oh I'm sorry mum, I'm sorry about that and I said don't matter, doesn't matter , well I thought, right I'll let him know 
Fancy telling him that
Yeah, he's got, he's got all the birthdays on his calendar 
He should remember , he should
 
I mean , he does sort of ask about the er
he's got them all written down 
How many lads at that age remember?
yeah , you
I never used to, you used to?
I did, I always remembered my mum's cos it's St Patrick's day
Mm, you

No, I always remembered me mother's birthday.
I've forgotten what day it was now, what was my mum's birthday?
I've no idea
Eleventh of January

Oh your mum's
I was gonna say, how does he know that?
No Ken didn't know your mother's birthday Raymond

Oh dear
Yes it was a bit before my time
Paul's in December, Fonz is er August

Rob's is August
Rob's is August, yeah
Sixth of August is Robin, it's only a week after yours, it should be easy to remember
Yeah, oh I don't know
Well you've changed yours so many times
Well it, I can't, I'm always getting mixed up you know, whether it's the twenty ninth or the thirty
Well he reckons it's the thirty first now
Oh well he's moved on a day then
I wished you'd make up your mind
 
I've altered it on our calendar that many times
What for?
What for, you cheeky swine
You always get a card 
If I didn't remind, remember your birthday nobody will.
I'd let it go by and
No chance of doing that 
That was when you couldn't speak, was it?
Yeah
Ah
Wouldn't say
no you wouldn't say a word
All I've got
you'd, you'd, you wouldn't say a word on your birthday you'd let everybody know well in advance 
The week before yeah
and keep mentioning it, so as they couldn't forget.
Loads of presents
That's one birthday you never forget
Small but an expensive present please
Oh big and expensive if you want
no as long as it's expensive 
Quantity and quality that's what I
What do you have Bertie eh?
Oh it's nice 
But you've just said one big one
Yours a
yes, yes, go on
Yeah you can tell he's not eating now
Why?
Oh shut up.
I've had nothing to eat today
Why not?
a couple of biscuits, that's all I've had
er,
Why, have you had an upset tummy?
No
Oh
you've forgot
no I just didn't want anything, I don't, I don't bother I, I mean I only used to have one meal a day before.
You're like a blooming dog, one meal a day.
On me days, on me days off that's all I ever had.
I like a bit of a snack, we don't have much at lunch time
oh a few crackers or something
Eh what can, what, what will Superglue stick er cast iron?
It all depends Ken it's 
Did you 
I've never found it very successful with big things, very
not big, it's not a big, it's that piece of hand handle of the gutter.
I was cleaning it up, I mean it dropped off there and it didn't break 
So have you still got it have you?
I was cleaning, cleaning it up  and of course I was tapping it with a hammer wasn't I to try and get all the putty you know, try and break the putty and most of it came away and I just tapped this one little 
One last fatal tap 
one little piece came 
Mm
I wonder what erm  stuff for the cars do Ken?
As it happens
Yes
What 
Great 
to fill it up to fill
put a lamp on either side you know and put some in a crack, a lump either side
You can buy all kinds of filler now it should do anything, indoors or outdoors 
I was surprised 
can't you?
I mean
Oh well this is for different kinds of metal you see
They do?
I know down at Evans I've noticed quite a few things in there, there are different
mm
you know for, for different jobs 
For who?
For you, it's
easy for you who to say
Yeah, but er, this is usually you've got to work on top of course you've gotta
Eh, no I mean I've gotta dark that
Oh you've got it off
Oh it fell off didn't it.
Oh I see.
So it's been in the garage for years?
No it's only, it only came off
doing that, putting that wire round for the aerial.
You should ruddy well call them back to get it  they caused the damage or failing that, claim on the insurance  mind you they'd probably say well you must get in touch with the company that did the job.
Well the trouble is you can probably get
I mean if somebody 
replace a whole 
puts an aerial on your roof and they knock a hole in your roof then presumably they're liable for the damage
Oh yes  yes, third party isn't it?
having said that it's getting them, getting them back isn't it to do it  what was I gonna say before I started saying something did you
What's that?
oh did you see that film?
That was it, did you see that film Blocking It with erm Dennis Weaver 
McCloud 
Weaver
Weaver, he played McCloud
about the chap that couldn't read 
I thought it was Dennis Weaver not Dennis, I thought it, what's his name McCloud.
No we, he played McCloud
Oh it is the same one yeah
Yeah
No, I, I, no
Do you want to borrow, well it's on two tapes, well I've still got it on the tapes if you want it, it's quite a good quite a good film 
yeah, you, you, oh you taped it when I was here 
it's quite a good film
Is it?
Yeah, so I mean you'll have to find a spot on the film where it
 

It's a good castrating because it used to be a bit of a 
this is a film 
You, have you ever had what's is name back, did I give you what's is name back?
Yes, yes
What's that?
the erm Dances With Wolves
Wolves, we did enjoy it
erm
Bob thoroughly enjoyed it
I think that's the first part and I think it's ready to go on there, erm
So that's er the one with the photograph on
yes
That's right
and the other, the rest of it is on the end of that, but I've wound it almost back to the beginning, that's Fantasia at the beginning of the tape
Oh I don't want to see that 
which is about two hours long so 
I don't want
so you'll have to fast forward it and suffer the last hour 
Well it was once , once, I couldn't see it again, but the music was beautiful of course, but then
Fantasia?
whether you want to listen to
I mean as you say the music, yes, but the, all the props in it, no
You scalpel
It was great, but it was I mean, I, I have to watch it because I'd never seen it before 
ain't you?
Eh, mm 
and I thought I'd watch it now
I saw it as a kid
Did you?
I, I don't ever remember
cos I couldn't
Yeah, it might be, yeah, it could of been a bit overpowering I think.
Did Kelly's kids watch it?
Yes they have seen it, yeah, I said to Carrie have you watched it 
What do they say?
What did they say?
Did they pay 
Cos I 
much attention to it or did they, distract
 
er well I didn't go into details
see it's not their scene 
but er 
I mean they wouldn't want to listen to the music I don't think 
I think er she said some of it was a bit you know slow and dragging for them
Yeah
I mean er there was some of the music which wasn't our 
Oh some of the music is a bit heavy too.
yeah, and
You know
out of your seats especially 
I mean ob , obviously the er, the lights of spring and the er dances of
 
very nice 
oh there's some lovely music in it.
We all know this but
but er  the sorcerer is
 
some of it is very clever some of it, the effects and when you think back to nineteen forty one whichever
Oh yeah, oh it was marvellous, but I mean it's
You'd never get away with it today 
It was popular in the cinema's wasn't it?
you couldn't make it today and get away with it
oh, it just wouldn't
at all 
well I mean 
and of course you'd, you watch it over sort of sentimental or what have you, but I, I couldn't watch it again I don't think.
I can listen to the music
Well that's why, that's why I said well we would 
I was gonna say I mean, yeah 
keep it on tape because
I haven't got some of the music but
 
yeah that's true we've got them on record , but erm, no it's erm 
It's not 
And of course it was Stokowski was the conductor you see
Yeah
he was a big name at the time, Laepol Stokowski
Yeah
but erm, I imagine what's his name wouldn't do it, Walt Disney
Oh good heavens no, I mean Walt Disney
the M B C
Mind that plant behind you.
Oh it was very good.
What's this one about erm
Well I, I hadn't heard of it on the telly, I
with you yesterday, Jessica Tandy, erm Green Tomatoes
Oh yes, yes
Cafe or something
yes
Look at this, it ain't very good
a peculiar title
Oh she's
How, how old is she, she's about eighty isn't she?
Private, she's eighty odd 
She's ninety two she is now, ninety two
Is she ninety two?
It's incredible I heard her on the radio, she sounded very allusive 
She was 
before the war
Yeah she was in the
The Birds, wasn't she that film called The Birds
That's right, yeah, yeah
only a small role in that but she sort of had a late arrival 
But she's the what's it, what, said like she was the toast of America for years
Mm
in the, in the, on the stage
Oh on the stage, yeah, but in films she came in later and only had small parts and never made 
yeah, yeah 
much impact until this, one about the chauffeur did she
Yeah Driving Miss Daisy 
Yeah Driving Miss Daisy yeah, have you seen that?
I have
Have you seen it?
I enjoyed that, yeah
Did you see it at the cinema or on video?
No on video, I, I saw that
Oh
it's er, I, well I enjoyed it
I was gonna say it has to vary to 
It's, you know I mean it's a bit predictable and all that really, but
Entertaining, mm
it was er
She's in that
wasn't she er Kelly Maguinness about the Macarthy business that
She said the play is
erm
The House on Carol Street was it?
Yeah
Oh er, The House on yes I think it was Carol Street wasn't it?
she was the old lady that sort of let to read to her 
That's right she goes to read to you, yeah
mm, then again she didn't have much of a part in that
She didn't, she's
no
in a play isn't she?
A play
What in London now er, a
It's on er one, either this one or somebody else, being interviewed
no she was sit in this
what play is that
I'm sure she said she was in a play
Well I, I know she said while she was over here, she's just 
Oh she was er, in a, in a 
promoting a film perhaps, I don't think she's in a
no she didn't, it was promoting, I don't know whether she was in the television one, but I'm sure she said she's work, she was working, you know she was over here to work
Mm, I know it, she was with her husband because erm whoever it was 
Yes, it was 
who interviewed her 
How old is he?
I can't remember who it was now, but they said have you been, have you seen this, have you done that, which she said no she hasn't, I think she'd only just arrived some, some time last week didn't she?
Yeah
But er, mm
but er
I wouldn't of thought she 
She's got very severe though hasn't she, you, never comes over erm a sympathetic character, she's always playing the
The more austere types
Like that one in Carol Street that was a type she played that one 
Yes that's her role in 
always thought of rebuking the girl, so
Mm
the slightest thing and
Yeah
very little humour
But then that was the role she played obviously
Well that's it
Well she's a bit like that in Driving Miss Daisy I think isn't she?
I've no idea.
Mm, well I'm only going by cuts I've seen, but  same type of role I suppose.
So what have you decided to do about these damn boards?
I thought I would go and take one of the head ones and journey along down to that place and so, you know, is there any chance you slipping me down a good four long ones and if he says no, think again?
Mm, see how many
Well how much is the detector?
One of the hand held ones
About fifteen quid I think for a small one this chap said, it's very cheap
Oh, cheap, oh I thought it would of been about fifty pounds
No
Oh
they're only a plastic job I would of imagined
Oh I mean
it's only that long 
What if the same situation would apply with iron nails presumably then 
Well I've no idea, you know, I mean he all he does is all timber so I imagine he's dealing with a quite a lot of old hand made nails and 
Mm hand made nails mm , you'll have to ask him about it, it might be an investment and begin a usually
 
Oh I was gonna say what kind has he got?
How much was his?
Oh I, I think he said they only fifteen pounds, those tiny ones.
Is that what he's got at this
That's what he uses, cos I mean he wouldn't be doing stuff like this anyway mind.
So does he take his to a timber yard to be split?
I wouldn't of thought so.
Well why does he use it then, why does he need a metal detect?
Well if he gets an old piece of
 
Wants to plane it 
or he wants to plane it or
Mm
whatever he wants to make sure that he's 
He's not going to ruin his tools you see
Yes, mm
cos well even the chisel he could knock, knock a lump of chisel couldn't you with a
Yeah
chopping away there's a, there's a nail in it
Yeah
not this sort of thing you wouldn't as I say
he wouldn't of been touching it with this.
So
Well how thick this stuff is then?
About an inch and
Oh it could, should do that
I was wondering what technique he'd be very good at 
It's a three quarters 
It's er three quarters isn't it
and five eighths whatever, I'm hoping to get two
Two boards
two shelves out of it you see
I reckon you can cut it yourself
Well that's what I'm trying to get these
to do you see, that's it, it's about that, that wide, and doing that by hand
And keeping it straight, you'd have to have a jig or something to keep it in
No I did those others just to
I got one side and then you turn it over, you keep to the line all the time you know, so the two cuts meet
Mm
most times they do, sometimes they
It does not 
the Channel Tunnel
We'd have two tunnels
Three, right I'll be going to Chester again tomorrow 
That's how they used to do it Ken
I know we did right, but I that's something I'd never
this chap with his book he says watch out of it George it burns you, look in the corner and get your torch, you know, maybe you're going to an antique place
get inside, sometimes
Get inside you're going 
where it hasn't , the plane hasn't, he said he can see and he tells you how to
See the saw marks, mm
mm, that's right, because there were like lines across where they
And you've got different sort of saw marks some of er them
saw, which er, is obvious a machine, they even had band saws apparently at the end of the last century, cabinet makers band saws  oh I've never seen, all I've ever seen is the big ones for mills you know the logs, these ones for er, obviously for timber erm
They must
need to cut them
and then of course there's
you can see the mark on it, that one's a curl isn't it?
But er, pre, I thought you were talking about George the first something like that  then you've got er hand sawn timber, you know you can see the marks on the board 
Er, you've been fiddling about at the back where it breaks yeah, did you tell Ken?
some of this has gone on
on the back there?
Yeah
Ah you want, you know what is surprising you know, he said about putting the what's its name in the, in the base
No
Well you know how the, those gutters one sits on the other at the joint don't they, and they used to fill it with er putty didn't they and
That's right, yeah
and they used to have a little screw to 
No
well there was a screw in
Oh
oh there was a screw, we had like a screw with er some
screw with er, with er like a nut on the end didn't they,
and I thought now this is
no way is this gonna come out
come out
Ooh
put it in the vice, I mean put it in the vice  whether, whether it just pull the head off I don't know but it came out
got a screw in there
Mm well you think all those years 
the knot, the knot in the what's its name 
Yes
but er
this chap said in his book about
and his screws, touch it with a soldering iron something hot, you know, the head in it, it'll get warm and sort of sometimes cracks the, separates the rust from the
Yeah
outside of the screw
Of course you'll get a bit of heat, get a bit of heat from it, yeah 
you to start otherwise your head snaps off doesn't it?
You wouldn't of thought of putting a soldering iron on there would you?
He does have some good tips this chap.
What book's that?
The one by this chap teaching
At college
you know he's written the book Michael Bennett 
bought the book 
Yeah 
Have you seen the film, now buy the book, huh
So you've bought the book?
I've bought it yeah
at a discount 
You weren't going to buy it were you?
No
Well I thought I'd borrow one or
you bought, well you did borrow one
bloke that came to er, theatre closing on a Sunday, a once a monthly
fifteen quid's not bad
Oh, oh that's superb
they're for sale in America, Australia, Canada
well
well I mean they I, I shouldn't imagine, I should imagine there must be potential or they wouldn't of sent him there 
Oh of course of course 
you know er, they're not that daft
Oh no, I hope that 
that they waste money, er 
oh no, I don't think they would be
I mean the thing is it's a limited market isn't it?
But the, but it, well like it's there 
A lot of people interested now you see amateurs 
Yes 
Oh 
you know you see them on the telly, don't you, housewife with er 
Ah well I mean there's of course well I mean that what's it you know, it's surprising how much, that Antiques Roadshow's
Oh well 
 
oh absolutely oh yeah 
you know 
he must get a huge audience every Sunday night, I know we would
But then again a lot of people wouldn't dream of doing anything, they go and buy some but er there are 
But they would read , some would read about it and things like that
Mm
Oh I'd have a go at that
Mm
Yeah
Oh yes  I wonder if this fellow sort of does take the erm mystique out of 
a great extent, they said we'd try to get some chemicals this morning from him.
Oh yes, well, you said you were gonna
You said ring old Bentley up didn't you?
Yeah, well er, yeah well go down there I mean he still lives at the back of the shops still just ask him
Yeah 
Well you could ask him right, I mean, I, I mean I don't, I don't think he sh , he didn't sell the shop did he?
And I don't suppose 
Oh no he told 
he sold off all his stock
they did a feature on him didn't they the other 
Yeah 
week and they
I don't suppose you know, I mean 
he's erm a bit of an eccentric now isn't he?
Cor not half, but he's always been a bit of
 
oh well yes I suppose so
He was as
didn't he years ago and the big kids sort of, well not torment him, but he's for the fun you know 
Did he, was he in, was he in the polo team or did he used to er
no wasn't interested I can remember seeing him about of cubs or 
Always used to go on a Sunday messing about 
 
a big str , a bit strong fellow to he had good legs on him, he did a lot of cycling you know
Mm
but the big kids used to jump on and all, he used to laugh like
Oh yeah 
oh as you say a bit of a character
Yeah  right so go down and see him, and then go over to that place near Red Row and see if they'll cut that wood for you  we can see it's just gone half past two now, I want a ball game on the fence post
post today
I offered to help he said he's got a mate to help 
 
I don't know whether he thinks I'm gonna
mm, oh unless Kathy did she say he thought 
No, what 
I was work , going to school
Yes he thought you were at college today because I said no, I said erm it's Tuesday he goes cos Kathy said oh your dad could of come on Monday, oh what's this lad's name who was helping me today?
One of the police fellows, you know
One of fellows he did his training with
you know and he said
I, I slept very badly on Sunday night but I slept much better last night and I woke up early, if I go to sleep early,wer , a, I wake up early
Oh with still aches and pains 
Sunday's I'm absol yeah, I'm absolutely knackered and I just can't get out of bed even though I'm awake, you know 
Great, good god 
and then other, like this morning I woke up about quarter to seven, well I'd been awake a while but I thought I'd came to at quarter to seven I went down and make some tea and having breakfast
Bouncing with energy
and then, no I wouldn't say that
but er, no my arms have been really painful this last week
Mm, mm, Margaret it's her feet, huh 
I don't know why 
she gets out of bed and she's like this
Oh well I'm like that al always, I walk to the bathroom you know
 
yeah, that's right, yeah to lean
But that's, that's something I've had for years, but my arms and shoulders 
Shoulder mm
and you know my elbows
Mm
my, my shoulders
It must be awful thing and of course you tend if, if you haven't got it to tend to think for god sake, you know it's a, it's a nice day 
You know some days I'm really like an old
mm
when I get 
Yes , yes, yeah
up in the morning once I've had a bath and I'm moving, you know, I'm fine
That's right
so I, it's just
yet you never seem to show it here, do you, once, once you're going 
m, well as I say , once I'm going  it's just getting going 
You know some people I mean er, er they're really bad
Yeah
they're, they're, they have to sit down
Yeah
for a, days don't they?
Yeah
But they say exercise is a bad thing if er the joints are infected, but the joint
Well, I'm trying to sort of monitor my diet really erm
Yes, you must
erm, avoiding citrus fruits, I drink too much coffee
Coffee
I know I drink too much coffee 
well we do, yes , that's bad for you
I've started drinking camomile tea on occasion
Yeah vile though isn't it?
No, I don't mind it
Oh
but I can't drink it all the time
No, no it's an acquired taste 
I've gone on to decaffeinated coffee I do drink decaffeinated 
Oh yeah, that's better , erm
erm, but erm you know it's just one of those 
but of course it's 
unfortunate things I think, so
some of the young people have got it, my, I mean my son is only twenty nine and he's got it you know in the shoulders this er
Mm
er, now he doesn't like to talk about it you see, and I said to him one day look Paul for god sake, oh, he'll tell his mum, but he doesn't like to talk about it to me
No, well mind you I mean 
which is bad really isn't it?
well Nick, Nick, I've always been the buffer, it's funny, I mean Bruce is, is very like you in a lot of ways, he's very easy going, you know and, but if the kids ever wanted anything 
Mum 
or wanted to
that's right
real to say something to Bruce they'll come to me and I'll have
Yes
and I'll have  to tell Bruce  
that's right, funny isn't it?
Yeah 
it's really strange isn't it?
yeah, it is, yeah 
And yet, you know, he's, he's marv , he's super and they think the world of him
Just that mum
It's a lot more when they were 
but it's, it's all cos you know younger perhaps
Yeah
it's still all there, isn't it?
Yes, yes, it is strange that they have this
Yeah, even on the phone our Rob rings up and er, he'll speak to me for a few minutes and he speaks 
Yeah is mum there?
yeah is mum there, or, you know, oh
Yeah  
or she'll have two talks to him, when I've finished , but mum on again 
 
what have I done?
I don't think it's anything really
No, no, it's just 
at all, it's just er 
it's how they are
You can make them up you me or or 
No 
no, oh 
You know, you know this casting
It would cost you more to build it up and buy the parts
Oh yeah probably would, yeah, new 
that's, that's your problem 
if they're new parts anyway
Yeah
yeah, yeah, unless they're old, old ones yeah  and they'd all have to fit wouldn't they?
I suppose they're not all the, you get a record, they, was a stanley
Yeah 
the other one's a re , I mustn't get one of these oh a long one it's eh
Yeah
for shooting and er doing the long stuff
Is it this lot they call jointing plane is it?
Yeah 
Or is that the very, very long one?
that's the smoothing one the little one, isn't it?
They're bound to have dozens of them in there
Oh and the old jack plane, remember the
oh, we have done that
yeah, they're not worth buying second hand I don't think now because there's so much wear on them isn't there?
You know the wood on them over the years it's
Well it's not, oh, this is the metal one
Oh I see yeah, yeah, I'm thinking back to the wooden ones, yeah at school, you know the er, we use to have a shooting board 
Mind you the shape
I suppose yeah but you, you, sometimes you get the hole wears doesn't it were the er blade is and all this business so you get a great wadge of wood jamming in there  but er, I could do spending a few hundred quid on tools, but  what can you do?
right, yeah, very, very useful
Oh
but I don't know, we
of those John are very, very 
Pardon?
dangerous you know, with the fastest moving
Oh
wood machine, they're doing about thirty odd thousand revs you know, so I mean
No there's twenty to
Twenty is it?
Yeah
over twenty two thousand
that's a lot of revs
Yeah
one mistake  you know forget something  and you'll be going round like this five pints   I use, I use to see quite a lot of things missing you know in a certain time
Oh the erm
I saw three bad accidents you know, with people on, mainly on spindles
they wouldn't put the guards, they never used to have the guard on you see you
No
you were like this 
yeah
I've seen that happen twice
yeah
and then a, a guy that I served the time on, he, he was he was 
And also 
nearly seventy and he's put his hand under to get the 
the spindle guard is 
er, shavings out
you have a block on which the cutters are bolted aren't they?
English block yes that's right, yeah
Yeah and sometimes it wears loose, you know?
Oh yeah, oh you must watch that
Yeah
but they're not allowed to use them now George said
Pardon?
here anyway, they're not allowed to use an English block or the French head, which is the one, you know, the spindle
And
the slot in it, so I mean really that one up there is a, a bit of an ornament, never used, I suppose you can see why because er
That's right 
they started letting, letting students use that well er  
of course, er 
they'll be paying compensation
they do a lot of rebating with that dado head on the
Do they?
Here?
and the
remember when you went up on it, the housing for the bookcase on that
yes, yes, yes
Do you remember it, pulling the machine across and there was your housing
Oh yes on the cross cut thing, yeah, er, er
Yeah
you can use it for a saw or put a head
and you can set it
 
that's right, yeah, that's right , now that was very useful that was
Yeah
the French out yeah, yeah, yes they allow it, well they allow them to use it don't they, I suppose, now that's very dangerous mate
I've seen a lot of those in there
saves a lot of work 
semi , semi domestic use
I mean there's so much more, well I did these on the mortise er, up the top last week you know
Yeah
did it on the mortise
Mm
and er, so all I had to do was the tenons really and, and at least you know that they're symmetrical
Yeah
you know, there's no, whereas when you do it with a chisel it's a bit of a, inverted commas 
Oh yeah 
right box on a bit
The only way we can actually go about it  is that if we use these cramps and if you remember me telling you, or I do hint every now and then, make sure you keep the cramps straight parallel to the rails, and that's the reason why because it'll fall straight, now if something's in twist and we want to bring it back again, what you do is if it's in twist that way, you put the cramp as I've done these slightly up 
Up 
now that cramp 
oh well, oh 
as you turn it up, it's gonna pull straight, that bit still didn't do it so we went to the other side, put the cramp the other way and having put that one down and that one up, now if you sight that now through there
Yeah it's alright now
This is wobbling isn't it?
One, one leg's shorter than the other for starters isn't it?
Jolly good
This one
it will, but what is the most important, do we get the
I want the shorter one in that one is it?
Yeah, yeah
George
Now what's happened in the past someone has cut these
that's right
wrongly
Oh aye, it's going down there
try and make it er
You clever Brian, no, ah?
What we've got to do is one or two things, do we get this right?
Or do we get that right?
And that's the original chair er when that was level, now to get that right
You have to take some off that one there
Or
afterwards
put something on there
Mm
and it's leaning forward and it's 
and, and these two as well 
supposed to have casters
No you should have casters on there that's why 
and it about up to there 
Should you really?
Yes
so that's what's missing
Shucks
so would of
It would of had either
Surely not, it would of made too high with casters
No, no
Oh
And if a chair's sloping like that you could of  
Yeah I know, but, but 
casters on
I imagine it would be a greater
So that's how it should be
slope than that wouldn't it?
Yeah
And not only that
No
There's something missing off there
no
a bit fine to get casters on the end of that
no 
no inch, inch and a half 
 
they do them seven eighths
erm, now you've got to make your mind up on this 
Once again I stand corrected  
What's more important  getting that level and putting that right or getting the bottom level which to me would be more important
I think just
So do we stand the cramping?
Yeah, this business of pulling it down there to 
OK, so we can use the cramps to your advantage to pull things back into
again, by just offsetting them.
I was mentioning to Chris before you know she had a hell of a job to get these joints out here cos they've got three dowels in each one
Yeah
now using Mike's method, you know, putting the water in
Well that's what we did to get this far
Yeah, but she didn't, she didn't inject it, did she?
No we just grabbed the dowel 
But the, the trouble was the water wasn't going into the dowels
Well it won't even if you inject it because, how 
I just wondered is there another way?
No 
Oh
all it will do is slowly soften and go in, I can assure you, you don't need to inject it
No, so there, they've got to be forced, forced out 
warm water in , warm water
Yeah
and don't forget water will go in with capillary attraction
I see
so the tighter the joint, the water will penetrate
because the obviously danger's that it's snapping the dowels and it's which, it what happened on, on the case of the two dowels innit?
That's because we were porting it
Yeah
what we should do when you're doing these and we took one apart but we didn't break them
Mm
and what your supposed to do is
Clamps
sudden shock
Oh
if you find that it's not moving 
I see 
with a sudden shock, that's when the dowels are gonna break, so what you try and do is you actually
Lever it so that 
fix one, but don't lever it too much in this stuff, just to move them 
No cos it's gonna snap 
and then once you've started moving them
Bring the chair over
in the water, so you start making the crack, you put more water in
Mm, yes
and that softens the joint, and it's surprising the warm water going in 
Good i yes 
it will soften the joint anyway
with the animal glue
Yeah 
Yeah 
It's best to use a rag or something round it
Yes it is, yes 
because the rag is only going to stay damp on the outside
That's a good idea
Well what about using the clampers we did before, turned inside out or whatever, you know with the, force the joints
These wouldn't, you know, you'd have to turn these round, you can use these clips to clamp a part, but
Mm
most of the time, you can, if you soften it, it came apart reasonably easy
is isn't 
so if the joint is loose
hand me swinging on it for ten minutes
they were tight, they were very tight one's 
Well if you just run, once you've got the, got the crack
Yes
Mm
the joint open a little bit run water 
Water, yeah  
don't even in inject, you know pour a cup of water in, into a, through and then it'll come off fast 
Don't you have to wait until that dries before you put the new glue on the, the joint?
No because with the glue 
 
Oh doesn't matter, oh of course it's water 
soak it in water 
Yes, I that's right yeah, oh there you are learnt something else
I'll point it out to the girl and if she wanted to, it, it's not a chair, but I think it's more decorative than anything else 
It's a nice brown colour that too, isn't it ah?
and it, it didn't look odd at all really
yeah
Ah that's right, have the, have the upholstery slanting  
What sort of wood is it?
Mahogany
It's
Why's it so pale?
it's
Pale mahogany
yeah, now what's
It looks like yew
Yeah
Oh is it?
You reckon
It looks like, no.
You haven't been here for  last week did you?
Last week
Right yes, yes 
Oh what a sham 
yes I missed you after
we all missed you didn't we?
something missing wasn't there, that, that little spark
Ah, you're so good
No I had a friend er from Holland who stayed
Oh lovely, yeah 
and well I've, I've had a sort of split feeling I wanted to be here
Oh well you've got a visitor you can't can you?
I know
How long have you got now, er before you go back?
Stopped dancing
Pardon?
I stopped dancing when I came to
What, oh I didn't see that
no, no and it'll need in America to dance
 
Pardon?
you can't dance with clogs on 
You can
Oh yes
People do 
I know clog
I don't know how, but
Ah, just eh Nanette 
I thought it was Fred Astaire
Don't believe them for one minute
Take no notice  did you ever see a programme about erm, I forget his name now but he used to dance with Sammy Davis  er man in he's nearly seventy now I suppose but him and his brother go to this place in New York and it showed him outside in the street
Cotton Club
The Cotton Club
Yeah
and this chappie had a double hip replacement operation, it's been on the television here and er, he said they started off dancing with Sammy Davis, you know, er what's it called, Tip Tap Toe or something like that, they, they act Sammy Davis and his, and his parents and then these two chaps I, I mean they hadn't made it big time
Well he was quite a good dancer himself
Oh yes, oh gosh, yes, well these two are fantastic for their ages, god the way the could move, you know
Yeah
and they get two
this guy got  absolutely marvellous but they were full of it and they said we just learned it we didn't, we didn't go to school or anything like that, we
They learned it on the corner 
they danced on the, on the corner 
they, they sort of compete with each other for different steps
Oh yes, oh it was all like in
you say, but it doesn't a character
Did you see that kid from Lancashire?
Honestly they, they were
 
you're thinking about 
clog dancing
clog dancing and
and the clogs have the steel run 
oh yeah but it's not the same 
but I mean it's amazing how fast
Yeah
and they, they beat out the rhythm in much the same way
don't it?
I mean that's, that's about as entertaining as morris dancing
Morris dancing, I find that very interesting
I can't stand it me, do you like it
I mean somebody's again there's morris dancing and there's morris dancing 
I feel that if there's, there's awful lot of history this cos there's a very ancient history behind it 
Erm, yeah 
Oh yes, I imagine, oh yeah 
I find very interesting 
Oh there must be, yeah, as an entertainment I don't know.
There, there was a wonderful display in Chester about five years ago 
They're good 
er quite a 
Mhm 
large number of morris dancers
They're still there, they were there last week 
but some from Leeds 
Oh aye there, oh there's hundreds of clubs 
The sword dancers you know were they use the
and some of it 
I don't fancy that 
is absolutely tremendous
Mm, mm
the way they involve these complicated patterns 
but I think they were either last week or the week before they were there
Mm, what about the Scotch dancing, with the, over the swords?
Yeah
You have to have a lot of plasters for your toes I believe 
 
 
No the Irish have the version of that too don't they?
That's right the jug isn't it?
Jimmy Cagney
Pardon?
I'm a yankee doodle 
Did you ever see that film?
Yes four times 
Oh he's 
sticks his bottom out
 
it's amazing how he changed isn't it from a 
There's a terrible article about him in the papers just last week about Mickey Rooney, he wrote some
Oh I like Mickey Rooney 
some, I, he wrote a biography the second part of this 
 
biography and got a real
in L A
Yeah
What Mickey Rooney?
Mickey Rooney oh, oh
Well Cagney
biography, autobiography
was a great song and dance man, that was him, then he became 
biography or autobiography?
auto autobiography
Ooh I'd like to read that
then he went into the
I'd love to
dance
yeah
Oh Cagney oh that's how he started off public enemy
That's right
Oh he's in the song and dance before
Oh yes
before the gangster on the stage
and in films
but Edward G was a marvellous actor, he was a stage actor he was
Yeah
I like, I like him 
Yes very good I thought
I don't, there's no characters
have any more, there's very few anyway 
It's like what's his name Sammy Davis, when he was alive he was on the telly doing all these and he said how can you do this fellows now he said?
They just train themselves, don't they?
Steve McQueen and er
They have no personality themselves do they?
all, they're all, they're all , there's very little
Mm
They're either shouting or  but I mean they're getting millions now you get this 
Was it Michael Cain in that movie he was in over the weekend, er
I don't like
Oh Educating Rita
Yes that's right 
Yeah 
and one of the few movies where he's not going around shouting  he was drinking, but he wasn't shouting
Yeah, quite good actually I like Julie Walters 
he was exactly acting in general 
she's er
er actually a lot of his film is fairly quietly, he wasn't doing shouting in Zulu 
He tends he tends to be
No
stereotyped doesn't he, I
er mm, the Italian Affair 
the only one I like him in, the one I like him in was the 
Sleuth, did you ever see that one?
Erm
Forget who wrote it, erm
no with Olivier
Olivia Hall, now that was brilliant that was
Yeah
Have you seen it?
Yeah
Oh
Mm
Of course Olivier, but he was good in that one, because he was playing his part, you know the  the jumped up hairdresser sort of thing  
 
Yes, it was very good that
Yes  ah 
but erm she'd been trying to get hold of George I think for about two hours.
No, in Weymouth where my son lives
Weymouth?
Yeah, sells half tubs and erm fittings for the old houses, floor boards, doors, bit of furniture
All architectural salvage places
they're very cheap, they don't seem to know their value that, I got those two Ercols there
Yeah
got the rocking chair, a wardrobe
the Ercols you say pay forty was it?
Forty pounds for those, they cost me about a hundred pounds those you know, the materials
Pardon?
They cost me about a hundred pounds altogether with the materials
What for the pair?
Yeah, yeah  dining chairs, six dining chairs they cost me seventy, I spent over thirty already on materials for the top material the foam  you know it's, everything's so dear now isn't it?
Yes
what can you do?
Down there if somebody wanted to buy a chair like that
Well
er a solid oak chair now is a hundred and fifty, two hundred quid a time 
yeah, I know, yeah that's right yeah, you can't skimp, you've just got to pay it
Pardon?
You can't skimp
No
if you want to do the job correctly, er it's no good buying very cheap material if it's gonna ruin the chair is it?
That's right
So you might as well splash out and
Yeah
hope you get the money
Mind you those er Ercol, we, say your wife wants to keep them
She kept them, yeah, yeah
but they're erm, they'd be about five hundred quid to buy for the two 
I you were saying, yeah , yeah oh I know the the good stuff 
Did you write off for a catalogue?
No I never got round to it John, I should of done, yeah, I'll, I'll have to do that
Yeah
I shall have to do that because er  er on your knees again er
Yeah on me knees again for you
are you gonna say a prayer?
Can't you get on the bench here er Nanette?
Sorry
Get on the bench
well it was all, no it's OK, it's OK, I need some exercise so
Oh I see you 
Shall I do it for you while you're doing something else?
Oh well
You could always say, oh well er they didn't stop me and you claim about half a million  hey that's not bad drop something on your foot and say
I'm, I'm crippled now
I think we
he's walking round like a lost soul 
Yeah
It's a pain then isn't it when you're waiting for, why you waiting for machining is it?
Drill that out and drill some holes in here, oh

How were they on batteries?
Great, they last me a long time
Yeah, I did think here getting one, a tape, I often end up erm cutting the grass or something er  get the Sunday extended news
I fancy er, you know because I've got a power mower
Or your doing something and you don't want the others to hear because it's
Yeah
it's gonna disturb them, yeah
I must get one for my er garage er, er a tape recorder, I've got the wireless in there but oh you know er, most of the time it's the noise isn't it, you know what I mean, get the odd programme you want to listen to, but a lot of the time it's erm pop music and that which I can't, I can't abide and then your Jimmy Young and
I tell you what also, don't get Jimmy Young very often, I like him when he's interviewing
Oh yeah he gets some
because he gets them to talk, he doesn't impose his views on other people 
No, no, no, no
he draws them out, which is what you want anyway 
and then you get some good er like a doctor goes on there and 
So many of these er Brian  they're trying to impose their
Yes, views yeah 
views 
mm, mm, which you don't want to hear do you?
No
You say it should be
It's my son, I'm sort of playing it by ear, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing  oh dear me  not quite sure at all

I could bleep her if you want  oh I'll have to have a word with them see what's happened 
well it'll be on board 
go and see
Yeah
Yes I'll do that, OK, ta.
No she's looked under the M's and the fax but, I'll have to have a word with Anthony when he comes back and see what the hell he's playing at .
He might have 
I know it's, I know it's
yeah, yeah, yeah
OK
Alright?
smashing
Oh I
is there anything down for number two, nine, five please, barley twist table
Two, nine, five, nothing, but we've got fifteen
fifteen
number fifteen 
that'll be worth forty ain't it, done up?
Should think so
Anything down er for these here computers?
Oh the wise one you're talking about five hundred, because that's worth about thirty two K
Mm, if you know what that is
Yeah erm they're out of offices I presume are they?
Yeah mm, business
But erm, that one you'll be looking for about five hundred for the ways
Ah, five hundred pounds mm, the
and the other one on the left hand side about two, seven, five
mm yeah, well forget that Why don't these bloody things undo?
There we are
Somebody had a go yesterday on that waves, you know, but as the
yeah
so er
so these are the sophisticated ones it
Oh, would be for that sort of money yeah
they're probably, are they, er they're not a home one 
Oh heck, well I don't know to be honest with you, something you'll be able to play games on
Oh no, no, I didn't, I wasn't thinking of that, but er
a bit of a
something about it, it's something in between that and
about a fiver wouldn't you?
oh shut up you
Ah
OK then.
Concentration
Oh I believe you've got to
in fact erm we only managed to get away with it by having the one
cost a lot er, thirty three percent very heavy
Mm
erm, secondly the a citric acid, is it citric or not?
Acetic acid or ammonia 
No it's ammonia 
Well this is very heavy you mean, the ammonia is it?
Don't know about that, that 
Oh 
to concentration on H H O.
We only have household ammonia, if we have that and that is erm quite, quite low on concentration.
Mm
I think myself on that the best thing to do is to get in touch with the local chemist
we often do that, that's what I suggest to people so they get chemicals that I don't have in
public relations get in touch with them and others
I see
yes public relations exercise I said
I see
Oh
erm, you got, it can produce 
you've got to go to Merseyside though for that
No, no
Oh
no you've not, I mean, yellow pages, local chemical firm, anything
Oh I see
I mean the amount of it branch round here
oh I see 
mm, they don't 
well then, then you could really, would be, I'll always start on, you could go down the police station and have a word with them, see what they think, and they'll probably put you in touch with somebody, cos they know everything they know what 
Probably 
region burns
and so on 
Yeah
Oh well, that's worth a try, well thank you very much, much obliged
Thank you

Yeah

What's , what's this in there?
Ammonia point eight eight O
Oh eight eight ammonia, I don't think I've got any, anyway I'll have a look in it and acetic acid is the problem is it?
Is that, is that the one?
That's acetic acid but it's got to be this
Thirty three percent, yes
I can get all the other things 
Have we got any acetic acid in here

more, then I can give it to somebody else and whatever you know and

Yeah, yeah 
there inside the wood and he dug those out.
He found them before putting them through the saw?
Oh I yeah, he got this, this er must of been a good metal detector you know 
Ooh, I say 
Three pounds that was for doing four of those long lengths you know and, and a short one
Yeah
which I hope might
just think, think of what it would of cost to get them boards and you wouldn't of got them as easy as that.
No, well actually, he got a load, what was I gonna say, he got a load of old pine there you see 
Yeah, yeah 
yellow pine, but they're all sizes, I said oh I said you've got some nice old pine, he said oh there's two guys come use it for furniture
Yeah, mm, mm
two big firms, that's all he
ah well, we, we did er, that house we did in, in er Kingsley, well the other side of Kingsley by Northwich for er, he's the managing director of Tarmac for the North West Division and there he bought this house at Kingsley and er we added on to it on the kitchen was a complete wing that we built, a single storey and the roof spars had to show we had to put imitation
Ah
pitch pine spars straight up to the purlin and the purlin had to be axed
Exposed
just as he wanted them, there was real oldy-worldy and the kitchen furniture was made down at Buckfastely in Devon and that was all re-claim pine
Mm
yellow pine and all that 
it's beautiful too 
and there was even the worm holes in some of the wood
Ha, ha
and that had to be there
Oh yeah treat them you see, treat them worm holes 
and he was never on his own doing it 
Well you know our old house was built with that wasn't it?
Yeah
Peach pine, and when we took the porch down which had been up nearly a hundred years
Yeah, mm
there was no rot
No
there was no rot in the windows, the old windows were a hundred years old 
well it's full of erm  full of resin you see and 
the windows were perfect 
the woodworm don't seem to be too keen on it does he?
Oh there was a little tiny 
They're, the woodworm don't seem to be

No
oh it's too, they like sweet wood 
well those yeah, those bark you took out didn't you, out of the porch

Yeah
square box like, there wasn't a bit of
it was a pity to take it down, but 
six inch square 
oh like the Jacobean style er  the er 
The black and white thing
The frame work
yeah all the frame work was sixty six, all morticed and tenoned and dowelled and there were 
Marvellous ah 
brick inset was all the brick and then plastered over and that gave the black and white effect, but that was the original and the, the proper way to do it 
all those years 
I mean today they do, they plaster a wall and they
 
Even the cellars got them 
oh yeah
weren't they?
That's, that's and that's how it's done today
Mm
Even the trellis were dry 
but that's there's 
over the
they put pellets and even the pellets sticking out thinking that people
but there's all sorts of ways of
Oh I
It was er well built that

erm our Steve, I remember Steven, Steven's
about
aye that's right
Mm
I always remember working on the, on the pub I, I, I did a lot of work on there for them and er he got some panelling 
To all hours of the morning .
he got panelling from er a big hall outside St. Helen's and er, he built this big room onto the pub oh this is going back nineteen sixty one
Yeah
isn't it?
Yeah, yeah
Is it sixty one?
Yeah
it's thirty, thirty one years ago
he built this on and the country pub was just coming into the, you know, people were getting out in their cars and that, there was no breathalyser or anything and the
could see the future in it, and he built this big room didn't he?
Mm
And I 
Oh 
panelled it all with er, with a 
a little bit of foresight wasn't it for those days?
Mind you it's, it's a free house and that
Oh it's a free house 
Yes that's right 
and wasn't worried then.
What did he pay that for and the old post office he got them, it was cheap
He got the old post office and the two cottages and the pub for two thousand, eight hundred I think
Oh god, mind you it is all relative isn't it?
 
Mind you that was in nineteen sixty
Yeah, that's right I mean he
fifty nine, sixty isn't it?
Yeah
Was it?
Oh aye, but fifty eight, fifty nine 
It's still cheap really isn't it when you
Oh that was cheap then
and how I could, we'd see him passing and he used to keep, he used to live in a li , like it was a farm place further on, Sand Mill Cafe, I don't know whether you've seen it along that road 
Oh I don't know 
but anyhow it, well they, they were there and he bought the pub didn't he and they were moving on the Saturday and he came on the Saturday morning and he cried take the furniture to pieces, some of the furniture, the wardrobes and there was a dining room table that they couldn't get into the pub, could I dismantle them and re-assemble them again and that was the first time I'd ever met him weren't I?
Mm
And do you know what it  every spare minute I had after, he was after me wasn't he?
Can you do this for us, can you do that for us
Can you come away from it?
and then he kept, he was on, will you come and work for me will you come, I was working for Holmes at the time
Mm
wasn't I?
And he had, he had me with making sheds, you know where the leader er printing place is now?
In Mold?
Over Axton Road
Oh yes 
when you come out of Mold 
oh near the new what's
that's right, I, well
had a yard there and an old building, that's where he had, that's where he operated from and he used to get all this second hand timber demolition timber from Liverpool and Berkenhead and all that and he reckoned then that for every hundred pound he spent on demolition he had a thousand pound back
Cor ten times 
taking it to the options
that is
and that's how he made his money 
But have they always been able to machine it Norm I mean to my mind it's always been sort of, you know, you buy, whatever they are like for afters and that and that's how you use them to make your garden shed or whatever
Yeah
whereas it looks as though, you know this chap, they found a way to make sure there's no metal in it and now the machine it 
all that, that they went through though over the years I mean, all, all he did 
yeah must of done 
was to get the second hand timber and, and he had a couple of lads off the dole in Mold there, knocking the nails well all he had to do 
De-nailing 
was break the nails
that's right, yeah
there were still nails left in but the farmers 
tab them all 
went mad on it for
yes
posts and
that's right
er
yeah, but that, that was the main usage 
they had to share 
wasn't it?
yeah
But you see now, the shortage of good timber 
and then 
now they use them for furniture 
now the best of the timber he had Gottonam Peters, the builders that were, I mean they were building a lot then and I'm going back now to the fifties and the sixties Gottonam Peters they'd done a lot of building in Upton in Chester and erm, developments er expect building sort of thing and er, they used to buy in all the three by twos and four by threes that he could get, the good ones second hand 
Do you want a coffee ?
No, I'd better get back Hilda
Are you sure, you're welcome
she's erm
they er
put the kettle on there, I'll be in trouble
and they used to buy it all off him for studding
Yes 
because it was dry
perfect
It was perfect
it was perfect for that
they had no movement in the ceilings or the walls or any of the plasterboard 
Yes, yes 
and all of, all of the good clean three be twos that he could find them that were season, they had, they, they took it all
Mm
as much as you could have 
That panelling though that you took out of that hall was beautiful .
but that panelling , that hall panelling was beautiful, I
Oh
Pity those places came down wasn't it?
and it's a, to, to go up there now 
Shame 
it's still there, I mean
mm.
that room has still got the panelling in
Yeah
Well did you ever go, what did you say
yeah
Yeah
It's a terrible name for me, where did we go last week?
Nantwich did you say?
Nan , Nantwich
Oh
In
oh
Ah and the antique shops there
Oh, it's full of antiques, there's a lovely little town Nantwich 
there's one chap there erm  no he didn't say it is, er Adams, I said to him you got, you haven't got a place in Chester, that's another Adams, no, no he said there's no Chester, the stuff he had in one, he had a, an oak settle, sixteen something, now there's wood worm in that
Yeah
but the shine on it
Yeah
and it was just being polished by hand, you know, christ.
Oh dear I'm in trouble now
No I didn't
 

I'm in trouble now
Come in Margaret
I'm very sorry
come in, don't knock the door
I knew it
Come in
come in
I was just saying get a move on cos we've got to go to Paul's
Have you spoken to him?
I haven't yet no, but I think he's outside mixing cement, we said we'd go and give him a hand to put his posts in
Oh
so, I come in quickly hoping that you've done 
We hope, hope 
I, I'm in a
Hoping that you say it was raining and er
Ooh, who's been painting?
oh this look's nice doesn't it?
I'm just trying to remember
Have you done a, is this different Norm or
I tell you, it's this wall
that's right 
This wall I put in, yeah 
Norman is this furniture 
Yes
That was there
Is this furniture different is it?
No
No, I 
No, that was 
That was over there 
Oh you took 
that was over there on that wall
You go into and lounge and it's just moved every couple of days isn't it?
 
 
He's lucky, he says what have you done now?
Me mother was like that, me dad said I don't know whether I'm coming home to the right house 
Oh
He says I'm gonna fall over the blooming stuff if you keep mov it's nice so isn't it?
We never get it right , oh it'll be nice when it's all done
So, yours was like ours was really, that, you went straight through there into the kitchen didn't you?
There was a little porch here , well you could never 
That's 
do anything because I keep moving the chair 
there was a hole there where that arch is, there was a little hole that 
That's right yeah a little entrance hall
And the door was down there 
there was a wall there wasn't it, coming down?
That's right, yes, yes, going into the, going in the hall 
 
which is a terrible idea I think
It's silly really isn't it?
At least all the way through you know
 
I couldn't believe it when I first saw it
No
I thought it
Yeah 
Had a doorway with it
Yeah, it's in its 
We'll get straight some time
It's much better
I've always wanted 
It's hard to imagine 
It's been a hard couple of weeks with this bathroom, Norm's worked a couple of days, you know and in between of course they, put just a shower and a proper shower 
Perhaps, when we were looking at bungalows, other than the descriptions of them and the pamphlets and they say ooh 
Oh what have they, what's he done in there?
They say and in a hall which
and we came to look at this one and it had got an inner hall and in the position was 
so he's had to move all the, the pipework and everything 
Yes, oh yes 
which is a big job
Yes, that is
We're on the fiddly bits now, finish nearly grouting and 
Yes, yes 
Now did you say you've got the same trouble as us with the conden ,condensa 
Still got condensation
That's right yeah
even with the new system 
Have to try and get , to get one of these trays I think and try that 
Yes, yeah, well we do I mean well we had to take our chimney down 
 
oh
and then you see we only want one bad
and then eventually that'll be like a little sitting room 
oh so you 
no ours is a, no ours is a, we had, ours only three years old, so er, yours actually 
It sits pretty well
Oh no, we've got a space under ours
And then it gets the sun at the back, you know 
it's not a modern one yeah, yes
It means there's only those two little bits at the side 
What have you got on 
oh that's better
of the system
Yes that's right
that's strip it now, so erm
Oh I see, yes, oh that's better than really
it is better 
we've got the hall underneath of ours 
Will you stop it
I have asked a couple of guys at the college you know and one fellow said the tray, oh he said, you can buy this tray from a builders, oh he said you can make a, a cover and I said oh god, make it the same colour as the mat and the er 
This is it, this is it , I suppose if we could surround it in wood or
the damage 
polystyrene or something, but then it looks ugly doesn't it?
Oh I would of thought so
Yeah
bloody awful
put a shower we have, gone
ours, you can smell ours in here, I mean you can smell
It's rotten isn't it?
sometimes you know damp
Mm, mm
and that's all it is
Well ours was loose, pipe was loose
Ah what's going on here?
alright, oh we've gotta change the door
Yeah the door's gonna open this way 
gonna open the other way round then go into the airing cupboard 
Oh you see, no 
Oh I see yes 
see their toilet
Yeah
it's co , it sits on there
Yeah
but you still 
yeah 
get it other sides 
ours doesn't , ours, you can get your hand right underneath ours 
with got the pipe, that's right, yeah 
not an old fashioned one 
I wonder if that's why 
but the diff , there are two different types aren't they Norm?
Are they?
Yeah
Oh yeah he said 
you still get the condensation
you'd have to see
Oh we still get the condensation
and the floor at the back is er
Yeah still there
Oh yours is a, I, but, how's the, of course we've got skirting board in ours
Mind you don't forget it depends how many times you flush as soon as you put 
and it's, it's 
cold water rushes in again
I, I, I 
Oh that's nice 
Right
once the room, once the water's got to the temperature of the room if you're not using the loo 
That's right 
Oh so you've got no bath now
No, no bath
you'll have to have one in the sink
that's, that's nice though isn't it?
we couldn't lift our leg to get in the bath  
But they're, but they're had a toilet too close to the house you see, so 
Ah that's a point now it might pull 
Yeah
so
especially what he says
yeah, yeah
that's the thing
that's a good idea 
It looks nice there Norm we had one similar to this didn't we?
Well in the other house we had, we had like an airing cupboard here and we took that out and had a shower where the airing cupboard was and we would of had 
But we had 
well we would of put a bath and a shower, but there isn't room
we had enough room didn't we for them both
We tossed, we ummed and ahhed, but anyway that's what we 
Yes, yeah 
ended up with
it's better to have this hall accessed though isn't it?
Oh yes 
To all the rooms 
Ah definitely 
I mean ours is only very, very narrow but er 
Terrible idea actually
Mm
but at least you can get
 
never liked it, never liked it 
cos somebody's in the lounge and you want to take, somebody comes to the kitchen you can 
And that back door is where we get all the cold
That's right blows this way doesn't it?
but we get away with that sometimes
Mm
cos we've got access at
 
yes that's right 
of course the wind is 
a bit isn't it?
It's much better that though isn't it?
Yes
It's a much better idea, I mean ours
Yeah
the
Every meal for instance 
Well if we've been on a drive like you are
Yeah
opposite
I, I think we would have
it's a better idea though isn't it
because you feel as though you
Oh yeah, yeah
you're exposed up to there always don't you?
You're forever closing the blind or the curtains
Yeah, yeah, I know that's it 
Well all they can see is the top of my head so I'm alright
that's all you need though isn't it?
And then, and then, me workshop's up here 
Oh gosh, I mean, well you can, you can stand up and use the
can't you?
Well you see, the thing is when , with that there
Yeah
and that wall there I can put all the weight I want down the middle
That's right, yeah
I, that's an i , oh there's the two walls you see 
cos there's the two walls, yeah 
yeah that's right
cos they're, they're, they're taking the weight
cos normally the, normal the joist aren't strong enough are they?
did you do a brick wall here or 
This is brick but that's stud wall
That's stud wall, yeah ours is a stud wall at the bottom 
but they're just as strong you see, the, the 
well it doesn't, see it makes any difference yeah you've gotta
Yeah, no, no difference
Oh I
Smaller if anything 
just 
you've got a window there 
we did have a light yes 
Yes that's a good idea
Let the light in, that's an idea yeah 
Yeah good idea that Norm yes, yeah
It does help and he twisted it so that you can put your ornaments there and there you see 
Yes, oh he's
inventor and all 
oh it's easier innit, to get to the room?
Pardon?
It's so much easier
Oh I like, I like it 
Well that's right , I mean you get it to
I'm surprised Geoff hasn't told you this over the years
Yeah, yeah
it's er, there you are I suppose 
Oh yes , do you ever look in that chap down opposite the er, the Downs, well it'll be the Downs 
see some guys would have to get somebody in to do the lot wouldn't they?
That's right 
Oh yeah
Not everyone can knock a wall out or turn their hand to it
No, no.
I'll have a go, it doesn't, I don't say I do it right, but I'll have a go
Well as you say
so
I remember that as a girl
that's handy that isn't Norm, yeah, have this for a den
Yeah
and know it
once when they come up here I had to fetch the telly out the bedroom you know 
Oh I that's nice, yeah 
and er, we had to set it up here and we sit here watching the telly and they'd sit here for hours
Ooh I'd love that kids
and er when it's time to go home I say let's get going, there's nobody here,
they'd stop all night I think if they could, so
Mm, that's right
It's like the little one said last, she said, can we come and stay here for the weekend you know, and stay up in Aunty Bonnie's room, they call upstairs, and Margaret's face she said, well er, my god she's got some good stuff up there you know, furniture
Yeah
but er, they wouldn't do any harm like
No
I suppose
No, I think our two, they'll, they'll stop eventually once they get a bit, a bit older.
Michael's still a little bit small, well he's coming up to four now in May, so, but er
But the first thing they do is put the video on, they know how to work it and everything
Oh they do, yeah, when we go down er, er down to Alan's they, David he's got it all
Yeah
and Michael is coming, he's, he's watching what David's doing and he's following suit now and he's only four.
Got this video game now, they know how to work all these 
Yeah, oh I 
and I can't stand the noise me, I hear it going beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep 
Yeah, yeah, oh I 
Yeah, you've got to have the interest ain't you Norman?
Of course you see they're growing up with them sort of things, we
That's all they know
we, we er, we had to make it up 
me , I, I got, I took me old three put out the other day and  so they said got your
got the college ones you know
I
about ten now and they're all in this white ones are metric, she said what the hell's this she said, I mean I've had it thirty four, five years something like that, forty years 
Yeah 
what the bloody hell's this she said?
I said they're
feet and inches, what do you want, oh, oh he said er , he's a fellow, he's a fellow of about thirty you know 
The one I've got is er, is like, they call it a bilingual it's, it's metric and 
Yeah you can, yeah, but I think me in inches I know it's a 
Oh I do, I do and my mates is on er, of course they've been brought up with the metric system you see and he's 
Yeah, I'm not interested in it , it's stupid really, cos it's easy 
say er seven sixty and I er, I er have to think now 
Oh , it seems as
come again in my landing
it seems a hell of a lot long way to me
Yeah, and of course they say it's easier, but if you've been brought up with it, well yes it's dead easier
What you show for?
Your photograph 
He lives on the common 
Oh I've seen this one, this is er, this is er Ame's is here
Ame's is about there
yes
yes
and there
post office there's a cosy cafe somewhere
that's cosy cafe
that's it, yeah
and doctor Colliers was here 
this is the post office 
the house, that's the hedge
all this has gone now
Yes
That's where the Midland Bank is there isn't it?
and on the corner here is this road, where you go park road there, they used to have a place where they killed pigs and made black puddings in the middle of main street
you can imagine and the, there was the moth , was the 
I was too quite in those days 
mother and she only had the one daughter and the daughter got married and oh she had about oh ten or eleven children and they're all running round in this back yard 
Oh 
I can remember about
like chickens
Well can 
imagine fancying the black pudding
 
oh my god 
they had a shop here one time
There
Ken's uncle 
Who's that?
was it, had a shop
 
on the end 
yes, I wasn't going to say anything, who he is 
I wasn't sure whether it was that one, was it Griffiths their name or
Oh dear
What was his step dad's name?
and then you, you know Colin  that was the mayor
Mm
well, there was, after this there was a row of houses with a little shop on the end and her mother kept that shop, Colin
his wife, Romana is it?
Romana 
Romana 
I her mother had the shop 
misery 
oh cheerful, well his, his father was a step brother to my dad and do you know, how on earth we're related I'll never know
cos she's the biggest toryism
Oh aye Colin's the same
Yeah
but his dad wasn't old John  wasn't
Wasn't he really?
Oh no 
No 
Isn't it funny?
He was a miner in Staunch
Bloody hell 
and he had all the boys pretty well turned out like that, cos that's another brother who used to come with the mail with the wooden hand
Oh yes Jo er 
Oh I know 
that's Colin's brother
postman 
that's right, yes 
postman isn't he?
That's right, yes
Erm 
 
he used to have a hook didn't he?
Yes the father was a very queer 
Victoria Avenue 
old, oh is, liked his drink, always drunk, you know, when I remembered him, didn't see that much of him, but erm, how Colin never turned like that I never know 
Mm, mm no accounting for 
Mind you 
he's a bit of a capitalist now
Oh I know 
sold, sold that land and er well I don't say 
it was, it was Romana's mum and dad, I think they owned that row of houses and the shop
Oh yes 
Oh, ah 
and they sold that and they bought that house between them Romana's mum and dad
Mm
So 
and Romana's the only child
Oh I see
so Colin and Romana went in with them
Mm
so they were left all that
They inherited it 
With the money 
oh yes 
and then again on the Council
Oh they think they're it don't they?
Mind you that shouldn't make 
I've never liked him 
They were handy for the Conservative club there
Well that's right, yes
just down the road isn't it?
Peter, Peter's another Peter  
What fifty yards, they'd have to walk 
is another one isn't he?
Who's that?
Peter 
He's, he's a big name 
Oh yes

But he's moaning to me the other week about you know, er and I bloody near said to him, well er, things have come back on you know, but I should of 
Is he the one who's dad had the electrical shop?
That's right, yeah 
Oh
Robert's it is now isn't it?
He's taken over 
But er saying about the system, the pressure and that you know I don't believe a bloody thing 
Doesn't he drink a lot?
Is he the one who drinks or is it his brother?
Oh I don't know about this
There's one that's practically alcoholic
Is he, oh 
Well I don't think it would be 
I don't know
That's what we must
I think that 
I think they put that that er
why Dennis, Dennis is the one isn't he?
Dennis is the one isn't it that drinks a lot?
Cos he's the one that split up with his wife whom I believe 
Yes, he's the one , Peter's the young one isn't he?
That's right, yes
He used to come after me for music lesson every week, I can always 
Yeah

Now look at it 
Was that a traction engine there?

A steam roller
Is it?
I was gonna say it looks like a bus
Yes
Is it?
Yeah
Yes, you know Jenkinson's up at the cross 
I haven't got my proper glasses on 
Steam bus?
Oh yeah, I and 
Yes 
Bloody hell

No I think it's about nineteen hundred that one 
Mm
there's a little garage by the, by the chapel there 
 
is it?
Mm, that's right yeah, on the left 
Yes that's right, it could be because those steamers they, I 
well his father owned that fo , for years and it Phil  had the shop, and then 
Don't know that they did any, Victorian 
they ran the buses from Mold to Buckley
Mm
and down to the station, used to come from the, from the station 
Mm Buckley station 
right up through Buckley
Mm
and it was er a penny each way from across to Mold and when he sold out to Crosswell, old Jenkins stipulated that for so many years they had to keep penny each way 
Keep the penny safe 
and we had the cheapest fares for many years because of that
Yeah
Oh he was a funny old chap, he was erm, very religious family they were, quite a, a couple of them went to be ministers, they were a big family
Mm

You see there on the common there, there was a colliery wasn't there?
Yeah 
That's right, yeah 
yes, in fact when we were moving up here from er, from Warwickshire, they er 
Many years ago oh it was cosy 
Oh yeah

And they, they asked us about mines in the area and we said mines 
Oh about mines in the, yeah, oh yeah 
didn't know there'd be mining up here, you know 
No, no 
and er, anyway we checked with the er solicitor 
It must of been a 
and he said oh you know about that, all was in 
 
I think
Yeah
This is it
Yeah
Well we used to play on what we call the Bonks, down erm  bet, you know Becketts Lane?
Mm
Well from Becketts Lane you go down there
Mm
go, er along a lane and then what we, what we called the Bonks were there, they were the old er workings 
Where they'd tipped the waste was it?
Yes
Mm
which had grown over with grass
Ah, yeah
and there were about three of them and I know they had shafts and me mother used to say keep away from those shafts 
Yes 
Yeah 
because they weren't even fenced properly
Oh no
Mm and there's still 
and I'd still be there 
there's still one down at the plantation, you know er
Yes down Drury
Yes
Mm
which, well it was
haven't been there for many years 
down the Gooedy 
The what?
Why the Gooedy, that path down there was always known as the Gooedy
The Gooedy, that's
Funny people there are
And the Scotsman said that 
I don't know
That's er Buckley is it, Buckley talk that is, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, but you know, they have nicknames, the Buckley people always erm, you know there was one live by us called Dirty Joe and another Mucky Robin and you know, we just cheek me, and I said to me mum one day why was that?
Well she said they used to pass each other on the way to, going to work and er, one would say it's dirty this morning Joe aye it, it mucky Robin
and that's how we got it, the names you know
and there was another one now, where 
That's a cracker 
erm Sam Sodding, and it used to, but I used to say to mother why did they call him Sam Sodding?
Oh I can't tell you that I wouldn't never discuss things like that, until I got about twenty five, you know neighbours or not, and I said why did they call him?
Well she said they got married and the baby came that night and he went about town now by god he came sodding 
Oh, aye, that's a cracker that one, I like that.
how you get a name, isn't it, you know, really laugh about it.
A miracle baby
Yes, that's right oh dear 
Oh dear well you've certainly made a nice job of it here anyway.
Well it'll come Margaret
You, I think you've got over the erm, the dusty bit of it now.
Well this is it
You're sort of getting it a bit more
this is it
liveable
Yeah
The last couple of weeks has been dust everywhere
Yeah
but it's coming on
once, well you know, once you're knocking walls out, it's, it's mucky 
Oh the 
oh
all over the house, you can't keep it
Well I said to him if we have any more
in one spot 
walls, he was knocking to do them pipes, I said if we have any more holes in that wall, I said we'd be completely with
I was, what I was afraid of, we'd end up with a house on, on, on a tilt 
On a tilt 
He was knocking holes here, he was knocking holes there
Oh dear
and it's not his favourite job is holes 
Er, I'll tell you what it's had a right old hammering since you've been here, no?
Oh yeah
Oh ours was like that, you know, I used to feel quite a shame 
Oh, ours was worse 
because for eighteen months I mean there was this sledgehammer and all you could hear was boom, boom 
I like, I like 
and he was knocking walls out
Do you wanna finish her off, bring a 
 

Don't be horrible you
She'd eat it, wouldn't she you know?
She must
I often thought what the neighbours that and, you know, and Mrs  who used to lived here then
Yes, yes
I mean, I bet she 
That's what we said 
was chomping away trying to listen to it 
Well as soon as you came to put the shed up
the dust
that was the first time we had an inkling there was anything, and that was the Sunday before we moved and he said do you mind if I come and bring the shed up and then I can stop in there and I go and have, a, anyway, he came with Alan and she made you a cup of coffee didn't she?
Aye, Alan met me here
That's right, made a cup of coffee and that and then, he was, just came back and she said you haven't finished, he said yes, she said I didn't hear you knocking, oh no he said, well I built it all, you know, it's all ready made and I built it ready for the bolts and, oh I thought you would of been knocking, I've got some knocking here you know
I told you didn't I
That was the first inkling we'd ever had
Did she have her cloth in her hand, did she?
Always like this, ready to wipe something
Oh dear
I was apologising for the noise wasn't I?
Blokes stand still or she'll have you
Oh god, yeah
with a broom, broom in her hand 
yes, she was 
you know
yeah well I'm
That'll be all
I said you haven't polished that grot iron fence out there have you?
No, no, she flipped 
No, no she's painted it instead so
I painted wash colour, so when the was comes through you can't see it 
 
you won't be able to tell the difference 
If we'd known we would of said a few things 
A method in your madness isn't it?
It is, yes I got a surprise 
I tell you what though , I must say there's less water here since, she's, she's left in the garden because it used to lay here didn't it?
Yeah, it seemed to be very wet over this side 
ooh terrible 
all the time bailing out
Well listen, get, go, go what's the name of that place?
Well he knows
Cuckoo's nest
Oh cuckoo's nest
Cuckoo's nest, yeah that's the place
We'll have a look around
We bought some after we had laid out for most of ours 
Cheaper than anywhere Norm 
we find, we found out about that place and it was, it was a third cheaper you know 
We spent, it cost us double and we, then it was the same thing, same place, they were getting
selling it to us weren't they?
Selling to us 
If we get this front here partly here done 
for another fifty pence per slab 
it'll be a lot easier
Mm
and just do a bed in the corner I thought
 
Well I thought if I can pave this front here
Mm
I can go into the second hand car business then, I can go all the way down 
 
Caravans Norm 
with the tickets on 
caravans or something
Caravans
Yeah
Yeah get a couple of
No they're too high they
a couple of gearboxes on the lawn you know and the go that's what you want 
That's all I always wanted to do in the lodge with a, with a little field at the side and all, I wanted to get a load of cars and dismantle them 
Have your own little yard 
but er, I'd of had
That was terrible that Norm, there was one, there was one in North Street 
 
when I was doing that bit of collecting you know, and the people next, either side they'd bought these council houses, you know, it's a shame really
and these
I, I, went, erm I tried to phone Paul
Got to get back to Paul
I tried to phone Paul, so I've got to go and ring him
 
an old car there in bits and then an engine in one corner
it is
gearbox, bolts 
 
he wants to clean them up, he's got a bit of
acid, I'll clean them up
Yeah, and you had the old bricks
We had the old bricks from our chimney 
They came out where I'd put the old door on the, you see where I've put the door here
 

One thing about it is you get plenty of fresh air here don't you?
Lovely, lovely
I mean it's nice now
Oh aye

No
I don't like it too windy, I don't like wind and rain together 
No, but 
but a nice gentle wind I love
I always say if you're well you can face anything
Oh of course you can
if you feel rotten 
my mother always , I used to say to her was I born in a gale, cos she could never get me in if the wind was blowing
Aye, yes
and I do like wind, I don't like still weather
I don't like wind, windy and wet if you're out, cos you can get really cold 
No, two together like last week
chilled, yeah
terrible, I couldn't open the door even to ask Geoff how Mary was  cos
No
it was blowing straight in here with the other one 
I used to hate that when I was collecting 
Mm
you know and you'd stand on the doors then, ooh, you'd be really chilled and some of them opened the door an inch 
I know, and once you get wet isn't it?
Oh yes, you can't get warm then
Oh you can't
Kelly keeps you jangling, is it Jessie, no, Arthur's wife?

Yeah 
to walk to the school
That's right

Well think about it for a long time 
Then you gotta er, think about getting to the post office 
It's a heck of a place isn't it Margaret?
It can be done on the cheap Norm definitely
Ah?

Have to get some cheap timber and er 
It will
Mine will have to be a lot cheaper than that
Huh, ours will have to be even

Is that a new one or the same?
No that's the library book I'm reading
The one that, yes

yes
what's happened, but it does say in it that at the beginning that you assume that he is a youth because he's got, come from university, but when he's in the graveyard the fellow, it, it comes out that he's thirty isn't he?
You know when he's suggest that I thirty three years ago 
Well I didn't think, well yeah

yes, I 
felt that he had to justify this long
 
length of time, mm 
oh I see, yes , yes, yes 
in a way he was thinking mentally, he was older than twenty
Mm
Yes
and yet at the beginning he said the king said we don't want you to go back to school, it sounds funny
going back to school
Well, well
Mm
There's a few sort of erm  bits about it that he's obviously changed or
Adapted
Yeah, or somebody's changed and cos they say to be or not to be doesn't fit in as well where it is and it should of been
Mm
somewhere else
Mm
 
Oh god I, I, I mean I , the books just been written on that 
Is it?

One was like this
Did you watch it?
God ooh, the operation I was nearly heaving I was
 
oh how awful

to sew them up
Staple the stomach, yeah.
Do they, they must do it
Good grief
inside obviously
Yeah
Yeah
they cut them open like and it's a big scar right the way down there
Your stomach go down there
What
and then they dig it, they don't seem to care do they when they're operating on somebody?
there er, oh right 
They're just bits of flesh , gee whiz
And then they got this 
haven't got the 
big like gun in like a staple thing it was, but it was a la , it was an extended one, fitted inside this rubber hose and then, clamp it and they only have a little bit of stomach left so they can't eat proper meals 
To the eleventh of June they've got 
after that
Mm
Mm
and there were two women that had it done, that big one had, had it done four times
That's right yeah 
Good 
the third time it burst
it burst because she kept, she kept on eating didn't she?
Kept stopping 
and then the second time she had it done 
And they've got to open her up every time 
Yep
obviously
the second time she had it done and then, they had to remove it because she went down to seven stone
That's right yes
from twenty
I read that, so, did she 
She could of died like you know, so they had to
 
She became anorexic then did she?
Mm, they had to take it off and she went the other way then
Well it said she's a nice, in the paper last
an evening leading review, it said er she is now a ni , a trimmed erm ten stone, oh a size twelve 
Yeah she had it, she was just going into theatre at the end of the programme, she was having it done for the fourth time
Good heav , well it said they only 
So 
do this operation if, if erm there 
About thirteen stone aye 
are health reasons for it as well as being grossly overweight
twenty stone like, you know
Oh
She was only thirteen stone when they took her in that last time, she was massive, she must of only been about five foot
Yeah, well this is it, she's only short 
Ah, a big woman ah 
do you know aye 
yeah
and the other one was erm a mother of two and she said that even when she was younger she was always overweight and she could never sort of go out with anybody nice and she just settled for anybody sort of thing, I felt sorry for her  husband, mind you saying this like, cos he looked a bit thick and er 
 
anyway she went and had it done and erm she was upset after she had it done like it must of hurt you know she was crying 
Oh dear 
and all that, and she could only eat liquid food for six weeks
Mm
cos your stomach, I don't know whether your stomach wouldn't tolerate the
Solids
yeah, and er, well anyway she down, she was like a model at the end
Mm
really slim
So and she was 
She changed completely, she was going out then, she was going keep fit now 
Personality change 
keep fit four times a week and he, he 
And er 
didn't like it the husband
Oh 
Well is this one who and he said she ditch, she ditched her husband and got she's got a new man or something 
I don't know 
This was, this is what it said last night, one of them that lost the weight said, she said it must of been her, yeah 
Oh maybe that's what happened in the end, that must be her, yeah 
said she was with a new husband 
the other one was divorced wasn't she?
Oh I don't, I didn't see it you see, I knew it, it was only what I read
Well the other one that had it done four times said oh, I'm on my own now with the little boy, so she was
before the programme was made
Mm
but the other one, they did this vi video diary that they each spoke on and he was getting more upset, the more weight she lost he was more discontent in saying that 
Oh 
she's not there for me any more and she's 
Oh 
only obsessed with herself and
Mm
I suppose she was used to her filling an armchair every night and just sitting there all night and not doing anything
content with that
Yeah
No life that though is it for a younger person?
Well she said I wasn't living I was just 
How old was she?
I don't know, she didn't half change, she had her hair permed, after she lost a lot of weight 
Looked like a different person I suppose 
she had contact lenses she looked really nice actually
Mm
Smartened herself up
Mm
That's what you ought to do
Oh god 
You cheeky devil 
get that stapler, got one in the garage 
 
ah, you want to see some of the twenty five year olds going to town down here 
I'm only ten and a half stone 
with dyed blonde hair
I know, yeah, tremendous aren't they?
big arms
I tell you what, do you ever remember Olive's, oh I don't think you ever saw her, Olive's niece she used to work at 
No, not unless I saw that wedding that time I don't know.
She was enormous, what the devil was her name?
Bigger than Olive?
Her mum was Ann , that was Olive's sister Ann and what was, what was the do at the
 
not Olive from work?
Er yeah
Mm
remember big
Olive that used to go to my school?
Yes, that's right
Short hair like a bit of a moron?
Yeah, yeah, er, oh no I think you're thinking of a different Olive
No
Oh
No, Olive that used to work when I worked for Laura Ashley's
Oh
erm  she was hefty though and her sister Ann used to be enormous years ago this is, and erm she went on a, a diet, I don't know what, how, how she lost the weight but she did and I, I hadn't seen her for some years and I remember her coming to the factory this day, and she came in and she, she used to do er her flower shop, she used to do flower arrangements and the girls at work would order them you know?
Mm
And she came in this day with these flowers and spoke to me and I didn't know who she was 
Didn't even recognise her 
Mm, mm
I felt so ashamed because I didn't recognise her and she was sort of talking away to me as though, you know, and I thought oh very friendly person, you know?
Yeah
And I didn't realise it was her 
no one didn't recognise her 
Well, she'd lost that much weight, now she's very conscious from then on, you know, she's sort of kept her weight down, but her daughter also had a job at our place and she was gross, I mean, Olive and Ann had both been huge women, but, but this daughter, and she was only about five feet tall and er, I don't know what her weight was but it was one of those 
What is it?
Got your tape recorder going?
sort of 
Oh
one of those size people you'll turn your head
Oh yeah
she coul , I mean she just looked like a Michelin man, as though somebody pumped her up with a
yeah it was, oh it was terrible and I thought what a strain that must be on her heart, you know, carrying all that weight 
This is it medical , no wonder the doctors want you to lose weight
well
well I mean the heart's the most obvious organ, but I mean it must put a strain on everything else 
I haven't noticed I've lost any weight only that me clothes have gone a bit loose, it must be only a couple of pounds literally but on Mrs  scales I'm half a stone lighter, but I don't think so by tomorrow night I'll be about eleven, ten
So is it tomorrow night Brownies?
The weigh in 
The weigh in
I was talking to somebody in bread shop and she's doing it as well 
Does anyone ever ring the bell Carrie?
All the Brownies' mums are gonna be wasting away 
All the mums 
Does anyone, when they stand on the scales
It was funny though, when I went to get on the scales everybody went phew
All the heads crowding round to see
I know, I was like that, oh dear
and those that are smaller their faces light up
Yeah, I'm OK
A lady was only ten stone 
I bet there weren't 
but she was only about four foot eleven
Oh, so she was still overweight then?
but she was the lightest I think, er, oh no, Brown Owl Brown Owl need to lose 
I suppose she was saying oh I can't get rid of it, all the other
Brown Owl needs to lose a few feathers for the summer
She doesn't no, no
Oh
she's got a lovely figure, she wears these culottes right, she's got these skinny legs
like the kids
she doesn't need to bother, but er, she's
I don't realise what I look like sometimes until I was exercising, looking in the mirror, god I wish I could remove me chest like, you know, I'd love to have a, a small chest like

Ironed

He's so gullible, honestly Brian is 
said, what have you done to your hair?
You know and
Oh
and I oh my god I shouldn't 
 
of said that you know, he's paid a fortune to have this freebie 
That's what I say to you and you don't like it
Well he, what he has it permed does he then?
No, no

They dry it I suppose
He has got curly hair

Round the front 
at, at the front, yeah
I expected to see the laurel leaf in the back you know 
He must of gone in on the granny department and
Oh dear
In my day, you got a short back and sides, everyone got 
Whether you wanted it or not 
everyone got the same
everybody had the same
I don't like the cer 
I mean at the moment they've got it short, but they have it long here and long at the back and then everywhere else short, short back and sides 
It's horrible that is 
It looks terrible it does, I'd have it one way or the other
Mm
either long or short, but not
He's a
Scott doesn't he?
Scott's yeah, his is
made at the moment, but I was erm Gemma came for tea last night and she wears glasses she's long sighted in one eye and er, anyway I noticed she's not wearing them as much now, so I said to her mum what's happening?
Mm
So she said oh she hasn't got to wear them as much now she said her eyes have improved, you know,
oh
she looks really weird without them on and I saw her like this 
Funny you get used to 
Naked 
Yes, yes
yes, yes 
Is she alright now without them or does she have to wear them part of the time?
Yeah she said she has to wear them for the television
Mm
and the writing and reading, but I mean before they were on all the time 
All the time 
like Scott so
Mm
I said oh my god
Scott you know
Mm
I mean I don't want him to wear them all the time 
Well I mean he doesn't wear them all the time does he?
Yes he does
Does he?
He has to wear them all the time, but he doesn't wear them all the time
Mm, well he sh 
when he's leaping about he'll take them off
When he's fighting and all 
It's corrective you see now this is the idea of it
Yeah
Mm
that's what I thought 
as the, as his eyes are developing
Yeah, maybe they will be that later on
Oh yes
but his are a lot thicker than Gemma's though
Oh 
cos I looked through Gemma's I could
You could see the other side of the room
Yeah
Coca Cola's
but er, he was in trouble yesterday at school for being naughty
Really?
he got called out in front of the school
What er 
What on earth did he do?
did you get the whole story 
Talking 
the whole story
He's talking
Well he whispered to me last night, you know, then of course Laura told me everything  cos she was there
Yeah she blabbed
Yeah but he's 
 
it's handy to have a squealer in the family innit?
I really can't wait for Sally to 
What happened then?
but when I went in the other week, they all sit in a circle like that, then there's a space and the teacher stands there and she was telling a story about the independent princess who doesn't fall in love with the prince in the end, it was a quite funny story
but she just suddenly went, you and she grabbed hold of this lad, and dragged, she didn't hit him or anything, you know, but I just, oh I thought oh god, you know, I felt so sorry for this kid like, dragged him out to the back,you were talking weren't you?
You know, she made him sit down in the middle in front of everybody you see
Mm
I mean, that was the embarrassing bit, so that's what 
Mm 
must of happened to Scott you see?
Mm
So, I have told him before because he has been told off before for talking you know at the back
Mm
he said mum Shane  keeps saying to me Scott, Scott, Scott 
Yes 
I said well you just have to give him the deaf ear I said otherwise you'll become, I said and he'll get caught out eventually 
Mm they'll see him 
Mm
and, they will eventually
Mm, some of them don't care you see 
I mean it's, it's the sort of thing we have 
and Scott's a bit more sensitive like, you know, because he was crying last time, Laura said he was nearly crying over it
Nearly
I said look son, I said if you're gonna be naughty
Mm
I said well it's up to the teachers, I said, you can't expect me, I mean if there was if he was picked on I would go down there but I mean if he's being naughty then it's up to the teachers to sort him out 
Yeah, yeah 
But they soon forget it 
I mean the thing is they've got to
they've got to break them up now while they're young 
They don't give the cane do they?
Yeah
No they don't give the cane
I mean they've got to understand that when the teacher tells them to do something that 
Yeah 
that's what they're supposed to do, I mean and if they do break the rules they've, they've got to accept the consequences and it's as simple as that 
As that, yeah that's what I said, I said, they have to go in a yellow book if they're really naughty  which he hasn't done yet and then they have to go to Mrs  so I said well you'll be going to Mrs  if you don't 
Mrs  
Yeah, you'll be going to her.
I bet they dawdle to go to Mrs 
You can imagine these lads can't you all giggling together at the back
 
Yeah, I mean they're only little aren't they?
But er
Naughtier than the girls though, can't let the girls
I mean it's all part really, of, of learning respect for the teachers and 
Mm 
and adults isn't it?
You know if they think they can do just as they like at that age, well I mean er the, the
some of them er when they're fifteen or sixteen 
This is it yeah, when they get bigger than you 
they're uncontrollable
Yeah, exactly, you know, but er he just reminds me of Robin like, you know, and he's got this brilliant way of ducking
you know when he goes to swipe him, he can duck like that you know, before I've even thought I was gonna even hit him  he's gone like that hit the pavement 
He's got that sort of , he's got that sonar device,tells you what's coming 
and even when I yell at him times he's gone, you know, I don't know
I could never connect when I was trying to wallop Paul and Rob 
but Emily doesn't do that or Laura 
We used to break all kind of speed limits getting out of the door 
My mum used to connect and hurt herself
Well maybe it's a good job I don't
because I've got a thick head 
Some hand
but he doesn't tend to show me up as much now thank goodness, but late one night he really went naughty, you know when they look at you like that sideways and they know that you can't wallop them because those 
Yes, yes 
in front of them, so I waited until I got home and took me slipper off and whacked his bum, I said the next time I said that's what's gonna happen, I said you can do what you like when we go out I said but just remember what you'll get when we come back 
Ooh, there's cruel
Yeah, he was saying all the way back, please mummy don't hit me 
Yes erm
Cruel mother 
I really laugh sometimes 
beating us up
anticipation
cos I nearly give him
but there's nobody else about the 
 
it's so frustrating isn't it when you're in the middle of a crowded shop you know
Ooh
and they look at you as you just said as, you know, you're powerless, you can't do anything now
That's it, yeah, they know you can't
Well no you could wallop them there and then I suppose
Ooh what and get all the
of all the grand mothers there 
Oh I know it's terrible , it's terrible now
oh you shouldn't let them, er, and the, the thing is somebody else argues on their behalf then they think they can get away with it more 
Well they soon feel undermined, yes or, or the kid, the kid 
I just say to them now 
goes to the police 
they were watching this thing about erm, what do you call it child thing 
Child watch 
on the telly the other night and they were showing this fellow scragging the kids in the kitchen, god and I thought oh, because they were all watching it, you know, oh they might ring them 
No 
I think it's I mean I heard, you hear these tales 
 
but I think it's as you bring them up isn't it?
If you keep at them and
Yeah, because I mean we laugh about it you know
Yes
I don't smack them or
I just threaten them, but er he is the one that 
You've got to be firm 
Yeah, well he is the one that needs keeping an eye on
Yeah
but Julia said to me before she came round with Hayden she said er, cos her mum and dad are still there, not her mum and dad, her mum and step dad are still there, they're only giving them forty pounds for nine weeks, forty pounds towards the mortgage like you know, been there since after Christmas and erm, anyway she said ooh she said, Steve said er, that's her husband, said to me ooh isn't Emily well mannered she said, she doesn't walk in the house, she waits in the doorstep you know
their Layla charges in like you know, straight in 
Go away you where's the biscuits?
unlike Kelly and David when they come round, they just walk in, you know
Yes she's very quite and sensitive isn't she?
it doesn't matter
you should say, takes after her mum
Yeah
mm
it isn't
some ways, yeah but what about when they're naughty they don't take after me
Oh well
can't say that
No I mean, they're not, they're, they're quite well behaved really, but that's, that's only the way you you teach them to 
You do get some kids though no matter where they are, who's house they go into that you know, strangers and they, they behave in a sort of a, a wild fashion don't they?
Yeah maybe they're too 
 
when they're at home
Whereas most kids, I don't know I think it's just the way they give them too much lead er, I mean our kids were always quiet weren't they when we went out?
Used to drag them in that's why 
When they were at home 
you don't behave when we go out
or somebody said do you want so and so, no thanks
Yeah
dying to have it
When they mean yes
When they want to yes 
I used to 
You have to persuade them you know, go on
You're right
which is good really 
When 
said to me about Pauline's kids her three lads, not the baby like the two lads she said, oh she said er they came to play one night, or they came for tea or something and she goes to work at night you know, she said Paul was looking after them and she said, he said you could hear all this banging up and down the stairs, he said, bloody hell he said they were going mad, and I thought that's what Tom and Hannah do when they come here, I said your two bang up and down like bloody anything I said that's normal, you know for kids.
Mm
She said, oh she said he doesn't want them to come again, well I said he should of just shouted I said don't bang them down stairs, you know?
Mm
Moan, moan, moan, moan, moan, moan 
Well this is it, they want to run up and down when they're little, I mean, they gotta expand that energy 
when they get 
especially if they get in a bigger house 
Yes, more space, more rooms to run in 
Let's see what we can do with this one
Yeah, mm
My Hayley's a bit like that, jumping all over me this morning can't 
So I take it Laura's got her sinus problem sorted out did she?
Yeah
Not through your mouth, through your nose, anyway it must of righted itself, she's still full of cold but you know, when you get that achy feeling cos she said it aches
It grabs you
Mm
Oh and she got, swallowed a tooth yesterday at school
That one's that been
No, hang on 
Oh no 
not that one, that's still there
The one at the bottom, that's unbelievable that 
I didn't think it was very wobbly, but she said she swallowed it and there's a load of blood at the ramp at school so, so I said that must of been nice for the teachers, mind, but the other one I found
Is this a bottom tooth now she's ?
The bottom one yeah, at the side
Mm
I baffled her last night the front one again, I was swinging Emily around and banged her in the mouth, if it hadn't of been there it wouldn't of cut her gum and went into her lip and her gum
Oh good lord
Oh it was in a right mess, but it still didn't come out
It's hanging on by a thread
all of that, I can't psyche myself up to yank it out, so
Mm
it'll probably twang back in again
You could al you could always take her to the dent , is the other tooth in front of it or behind it?
Behind it, yeah the other 
Behind 
dentist said no, they don't want, they don't like taking them out 
They don't like to do it what even in under those, I mean the other tooth's nearly the same size, this is what happened with that tooth of mine there, I was 
It was growing behind
it, the other one wouldn't come out and eventually the to , this tooth that's here now
Mm
was the same length as the one in front so
its, honestly it was and eventually of course it did come out and there's always been a gap because the one behind
Behind, you know everybody you 
couldn't straighten out 
talk to the dentist's say kids have got to wear braces, so just about everybody has been told 
Oh 
gotta wear braces so 
I always thought it was only Canada that do it with
Yeah 
The Americans do that a lot 
they're very light weight ones now aren't they?
 
Oh yes , yes, marvellous
so it's glasses, braces and grom grommets in their ears now
Grommets?
Yeah
Who had
grommets is it or grommet?
Yes it is a grommet well
Nearly every nearly everybody you speak to, if they've got erm
What on earth for?
I think it's because the passages are so small they get bunged up, I know Anna across the road's got it done once but er Michelle said they've come out, but er, they're supposed to drain them so she said
What?
Every morning they're supposed to have a load of gunk on the pillow where it's drained out 
Oh god 
but she said er, they didn't do too well with Anna because it didn't drain 
and this is an operation to actually to have this inserted?
Yeah, yeah, they just put them in their eardrum part
Mm
and it's supposed to just leak out through 
to drain it 
instead of, cos she was nearly deaf you see, and er 
God 
there's a few people have now said that their 
Oh I've never heard of that it must be 
a lot of them if it isn't sorted out have them the no , what do you call them the adenoids 
Sinuses 
and the
Mm
and the tonsils and their
done as well at the same time
Yeah
and that tends to clear
Well the adenoids must be, I mean must, I always think of Melvyn Bragg you know
Mm
he sounds very adenoidal 
say he's got a flat nose hasn't he?
but er
Problem is 
I think Jeanette said Tom had that problem cos he didn't speak until he was about two and a half and they thought he was you know a bit daft 
Retarded 
and it must of been because of that
Because he couldn't hear properly
because er, they've got both got very small noses and Hannah's always talking like that you know
Mm
through her nose, but, so there must of been, she's alright but her nose is blocked up all the time
Mm
Made up for it since though
So, well they're all at school today anyway
Yeah Emily was trying it on again this morning, I think it's just that she gets tired cos she feels slothlike in the morning and then by the end of the day she's over like a rocket 
She's wound up 
Yeah, so I said well you know because I was thinking oh god if I go to college and she's off bloody sick all the time, but I think it's just that she's tired and you know
Mm what time do you, do they go to bed?
Go to bed at half seven, she doesn't go to sleep until about quarter past ten some nights reading 
I know they read yeah
gonna get that
Oh
It usually means Scott has fallen asleep 
I mean if, if they are in bed, I mean if they are there they are resting to some extent, even if they're sort of awake but 
She's just not, oh I don't know, thinks she's gonna miss something I suppose
Yeah, she's a late bird, but er
Don't like getting up, but she'll be alright
does she, you, you said she was having vitamins for a while didn't you?
Not having now, god she, I mean she doesn't eat a lot, but she eats so many different things, I mean
Mm having a good variety 
she's on the organic crisps at school and er
well
fruit and she eats a lot of salad cos she loves salad you know
Mm
if I had a salad I mean
it's unusual that for children really cos they don't usually go for salad 
Yeah, well even Laura like she eats salad at school like you know, but erm, she's got erm, what did we have the other night cos we'd been eating semi  semi Mediterranean food this week 
cos I made these stuffed tomatoes with rice in
Oh those are nice I like those 
last night and we had cheese and onion pasties with them  so
Bang goes the diet
Oh no
Well Laura and Gemma wanted to make these pasties and she'd asked me at the weekend and I didn't have the time because I think Irene came down cos I asked Irene whether she'd looked after, you know I'm at college until three, and she said yeah I'll pick them up and er I couldn't get her out at then so I promised she could make them so, I said alright you and Gemma make them, anyway they did very well they made them in about fifteen minutes because we had to go and get Emily at four from school, I said hurry up, hurry up put the water in Emily quick stick them together  shove them now and put them in the oven
What were they cheese and onion?
Cheese and onion little pasties they made and Laura didn't want to eat any for tea they did their nut with her
God
so she just had the rice and an egg with it and Gemma had about three pasties and I had stuffed tomatoes with rice and erm, what did I do with, I done rata , ratatouille and
That's nice yeah 
ratatouille which is easy to make, I didn't know I was making ratatouille 
That's a nice one 
anyway before I read the
Mm
recipe of it
That's a nice one that erm, pomme de terre 
Yes, yeah
but of course it's got eggs in it and it, it's no good is it?
Erm that's not the shaped spiral shaped?
Layers of 
Oh layers of potatoes
layers of potatoes and erm cheese
and then you pour the egg mixture over it and cook it
Oh what's the egg mixture then?
Not custard?
Ah er no, er just eg , egg
Ah egg 
a couple of eggs 
A beaten egg isn't it?
with milk I think that's what it is
Oh like a flan mix then?
but erm 
mm or a quiche
Yeah I suppose that's right yeah in, in a casserole dish 
Like a flan with potatoes and cheese in , mind you you're supposed to cut down on the cheese
Well this is it, it's dairy 
 
I suppose isn't it?
But the spuds taste lovely ooh
Mm
but you've got to par cook them because they don't
Yes quite a lot when they're 
cook quickly enough 
yeah what did I do with
we had er
salty potatoes
This is like true confessions this 
forget that 
Ah you'll have to do what Ken does 
All the things that you shouldn't have 
Made me laugh last night, he said erm  I, I, I always do a load of spuds he said even if it's 
Yeah 
Ah he knows 
 
only him and then he said you know 
He said I do a lot 
and then, and then I fry them then 
and then keep them and perhaps have a bit of a fry up
oh god
Ah
eats, I'm sure he eats all the wrong stuff you know?
Yeah
Well, well I mean we called in the other day 
he doesn't seem to put on any weight mind 
He won't eat any no, no, no 
in the afternoon and er
he don't eat a lot
he had a biscuit with a cup of tea and he said that's the first thing I've had to eat 
He doesn't eat much 
today and I said well why?
You know, he said oh I, I usually only have one meal a day 
You see he won't eat veggies 
Perhaps he's used to having one meal he wasn't there in the day time
Well that's right
Won't eat any veggies you know, none 
Well how 
I don't 
can he go to the toilet 
think he used to bother 
flipping heck, unless he eats fruit
Oh er, I don't think he does, he likes 
He doesn't 
and, he erm raw vegetables 
An apple now and again but it
he'll eat raw carrot and things like that but otherwise the only vegetables he'll eat are potatoes he eats 
peas about, yeah but he doesn't, he doesn't eat them much does he?
If had a plate of raw carrots 
Now I would always peel a carrot 
It's a bit boring isn't it?
Well I was gonna say he doesn't
Not very often 
if he ever ever comes to our house and you're doing stuff then he'll pick one won't he'll make a celery
Yes if we catch him he eats a couple of carrots in his hand 
Does he eat salad then?
He doesn't , well he'll have salad minus oh he does oh I think he will have a salad but he doesn't like tomatoes 
I think, I think they're quite big meat eaters really and erm 
They were 
They like a lot of meat 
saying at this mediterranean diet that the more fruit and veg you eat the less chance you've got of heart disease and cancer 
Oh yes 
Oh yes that's right, yeah
er you know if you think you're not gonna get cancer you would eat more vegetables really
I mean
Yeah
they, they've always been known for marvellous skin haven't they, the erm
Oh they all look skinny
Mm
continent because of olive oil, plenty of erm vegetables
I've got some olive oil but I've noticed if you look on the olive oil that some of the, some of it isn't mono unsaturates is it, you know, on a lot of it
Olive is olive oil 
olive oil 
Gotta be pure olive oil 
pure olive oil 
yeah, but it's got saturates in
Has it?
How can it?
I must have a look on my bottle I've
on this one I've got, yeah because this was one of them 
I didn't study the label
No I didn't, I thought it was all good 
I just I just saw it was pure virgin olive oil and I thought oh that'll do 
Yeah but even if it says virgin it can still 
That's what the can says 
Oh thought it came straight out of an olive it can't do any harm can it?
Mm, but unless it's added additives
Saturates fifteen grammes
Oh you haven't got your glasses on
No
That's not much is it?
Yeah, but I'm saying, don't tip it up cos the tops broken
Yeah
there, I didn't think there was any saturates in it, olive oil
No
Got a small
and that is one of the, the lowest that one  and it was one of the cheapest ones as well 
Mm, that's probably why though 
I, this is it you've got to get the er 
if you get the virginal I don't think
Have you?
No I looked on the virginal and it had more saturates in than this
Oh
No wonder then
So if you look, and they, and they say the more mono unsaturates it's got is better for you isn't it, rather than polyunsaturates cos it's broken down either further isn't it?
That's right, yes, yes 
Mm
And there's seventy thousand 
Well the article I read in it, it said erm, you know you can drink gallons of it, I mean I don't know 
You've got to be a blooming chemist now to de ,de , decipher all these labels.
Well I suppose like 
Yeah 
if you were born in the Mediterranean you would of been eating that stuff anyway and you'd never have, think about it 
Yeah, yeah 
You see the South of 
We eat all
the South of France they said in the paper they eat a lot of butter or cook a lot 
Oh do they?
Do they?
the North it's all, nearly oil they use
Mm
that's the most civilized country as well 
I don't cook in, in I cook with oil, if I use oil 
They cook everything in butter don't they?
but I very rarely fry any thing anyway 
Oh when I was at college 
Yeah and makes 
you know in a, in erm restaurant, in a hotel or whatever, but I, mind you, you don't go to a hotel that often 
When I go shopping I 
I mean I, I 
I want it simplified, I want it in big letters this is good for you, this is not so good, or this is bad 
No just good, bad 
or this is very bad 
That's what they say on Food and Drink in
you know and then it's up to you but 
Yeah but there's a lot of ambiguity about it isn't it, they you know they say this is 
Oh very ambiguity 
the wholemeal or whatever
Yeah
and as you say you've only gotta read the small print you find that spent percentage of this and that.
Mm, you see, I always get that erm
that you can see how many
Yes
but then you've Tesco's own brand
Mm
which is brown and white bread
A mixture of it
with only, with only 
this is the trouble 
with only a few little bits in it
Mm
There's nothing in it, yeah, we, we had a loaf once, sliced, brown bread and there was a line across it there, it was white 
A streak of white yeah where the dough, streak of white dough hadn't been mixed in properly 
We said god look at this , you know it looked as though it had been painted 
Mm, a marble, a marble loaf , there you are
so it makes you wonder you know as you say
Mm
is good isn't it?
Because
Their granary bread is beautiful
oh
Is it?
It's a lovely taste I mean I don't 
Straight 
no it doesn't look particularly dark 
Where it comes from 
but it does, oh it's great 
It's got all those little bits in you know?
Yeah, well Scott I mean he just eats loads of bread 
Malted loaf 
so I mean I don't mind you know 
That's good he's, he's off the white bread now isn't he?
No we don't eat any white bread now
It's abso , I can't eat it now
They, well there's no taste to it, I mean it's what you put on white bread 
I think brown fills you up more
Of course it does
so there aren't as many slices though 
It's just as nutritious though, isn't it?
Yeah there's something in that you see, the white 
I mean they have to by law, when it's, I mean 
When there's no fibre in it that's the different
That's right,
Yeah that's right, I mean it's so refined 
the  the ger the 
they took all the goodness out of it and then by law they have to put it back again don't they, to er 
Yes, yeah, yeah it's like er breakfast cereals are good for you in a way that they've got all the vitamins in for kids ain't they?
Mm
We get these Weetaflakes, you know, which are like
Yes those are good
but every now and then we get something with a special offer on which we're getting the Kelloggs cornflake bowls at the moment.
Cocoapops
No we don't buy them 
Haven't had Cocoapops for ages
Oh what's the other thing snap, crackle and pop 
 
Oh there's so many of them, so many things I don't know
Oh yeah
What
well I'm gonna try and do my brakes
Yes his car brakes, listen erm, this erm, this sponsor thing does it say 
You can either do it per pound or you can do a total amount in the end
Eh?
Oh I see, I was gonna say because Joyce said oh I'll, I'll 
Nothing for a penny?
Cos if I lose twenty eight pound then you, then you sponsor me for
Penny a pound?
A pound
No
divided by twenty eight pence, I mean, divided by twenty eight
That'll be two pounds, two pounds eighty if it was ten pence a pound
Mm
so you know if you just say a pound for the whole lot 
Yeah, it's till June this yeah?
Yes, it's till June
You haven't written any letters off yet, no?
I have yeah so 
Any 
and I've got three phone numbers to ring but I thought I'd wait till the end of the week until I'm  about eleven and a half 
Julia said oh you don't look eleven and a half, but er I'd still like to look about, I don't know about ten, I suppose  oh you do have to do
 
go on then get up there and unlock the door
I don't know
So how often are you going to be going to the dance now that the weather's better you mean

Unsinkable, like the Titanic

Ah, mm 
when I persuaded her to go in, I said you're alright Jackie just run in
She fell in, it'll be 
quickly 
a big wave
God, yeah
Everybody hurried then out of the way I suppose 
in the shallow end 
and Andrew he didn't want her to hold him in the water, he wanted to walk
thought he could of in the water he didn't realise it would go over his head 
There's a 
can do as well 
Aye all me things for
oh is that what it is?
I know, I'm gonna staple it back up
Oh my grief
Did you get all that bumph off er Barry ?
Looking for er people who cand , not candidates looking for people to, you know, vote for him?
No
We got a letter about animals and their policies you know and 
funny thing there was a letter in the paper though er in the Legal last night and it was some woman who'd written to say that erm, this little girl had collected two, over two hundred signatures for erm the er anti hunting
Oh yes yeah 
lobby you know, erm and presented or sent them 
that's a lot isn't it?
to Barry  along with other, numerous other people
Yeah

they will know who we are
he said it's a pity that erm Barry  didn't see fit to vote for it, so
You mean he didn't?
Well no, if, if that letter's to be believed he must know 
Abstained or something did he?
must of well he must of done
Oh that's bad
see, there are a lot of farms up where Barry lives
Got to be realistic, is that what you always say?

What are you gonna do?
No you
next time he waves to me and I'm going up town I'll be

He's got no clout has he?

I mean they can't , they can't possibly do everything for everybody at the right time I mean 
local level they do er

No way 
can baby sit
Ah?
for a couple of nights, when she was on, she asked me if I thought Ken would baby sit a couple of nights, if he could you know perhaps ask different people to baby sit you see, so I said well I didn't like the idea of that anyway 
He wouldn't mind 
so I said well, I said I thought of baby sitting you know if you want.
I mean she doesn't she didn't know how many nights it would be 
It couldn't be nights though could it?
Well no evenings you see 
Not if it's ten till oh evenings
No

like six till ten something like that you see
Yeah
that sort of evening shift erm
so it's four hours 
and anyway she said that whoever the girl is, she works at the school in the day and she works at the erm
in the evening you see, anyway she said the evening shifts are all full
Sshh
but they have got Saturdays and Sundays, or she thinks there's Saturday and Sunday, she's gonna ask about it

Go on!
You don't take it to bed with that do you?
Wouldn't make any difference anyway Brian!
But tha 
You'd only get snoring on it!
Hey, you could tape him in the night so he can believe you next time, that he snores!
I might do that actually , yes.
He doesn't snore do you mate?
What about you waking up and sno talking!
That's because of the snoring an 
Well that's alright.
Woke up one night and I heard this voice er  can't remember what you said now no hey!
Get off!
I almost went yo totally deaf then for about two hours an 
Good!
you'd gone to sleep!
Well you know what it's like now to be woken up in the night!
Mm.
We were woken up by 
It's terrible!
some noisy  rowdy neighbours or  i no, I don't think they were neighbours were they?
Oh, Saturday night, yes!
You don't know who it was?
We had an early night, I mean we were literally shattered!
Mm.
Erm  so  by about nine o'clock we absolutely knackered so  we went to bed.
About half past nine wasn't it?
Mm.
I mean, we'd just gone  straight away well in fact, we fell asleep down here that's why we went.
You did!
Mm.
Alright, I did!
You went first!
I know!
So that's why we went to bed and erm  two o'clock in morning we heard this  football being kicked  o on the main road at the side there.
Well that's not neighbours is it?
Well  no.
And then I heard some shouting and I, I looked out of the window, I mean it woke us up!
Then he got dressed, then he went and shut the gates, then he came 
Well I'd le 
back in!
I left the gates open.
What time was it, two o'clock?
Two o'clock in the morning.
Mm.
And I'd left the gates open an oh it was Friday!
Not Saturday.
Friday night.
Wasn't Friday night, it was Saturday, course it was!
Anyway  er  I went out and  I shut the gates and just let them know that  you know, they'd sort of I wa I was checking 
Wait a minute!
Now there was something in the paper tonight about the  ruckus  you said I'll have to ask Brian about that.
It was at the mechanics wasn't it?
What  what night 
 
was that?
Was that Saturday?
There was seventy people fighting outside a mechanics!
That's right!
And you said  about that.
Ooh I didn't hear that!
You did
Last night.
It was  oh was it las 
Last night?
Last night?
Are you sure?
Oh!
Well perhaps it wasn't.
Yes, well they're not that bad in the news are they?
Well I   
I know they're slow  but
it's not an  it's not instant reporting !
No the war's over!
Like I said they we erm  th th didn't say whether they were connected with pub.
There's some suggestion that they weren't.
Well the men from mechanics weren't they?
The gang was from erm  where did it say now?
I dunno!
I haven't, I didn't read it actually you sa what you told me.
Outside the mechanics.
Oh it's raining!
But you didn't hear anything last night?
No.
So they've arrested  there 
No.
were three  three in court anyway, I hope they've  all this lot.
It's stupid!
Well, so, no it wasn't Saturday night then.
So what happened when you got out ?
Well I went outside and I shut my gates and  they saw  I mean, er I was looking at them as I was shutting the gate, there's only  three of them!
Mm.
And a couple of girls  so they got the message and then the  they moved off down  towar down the bottom.
And then there's a bit more shouting  and they ran through the entry.
Were they  drunk?
Oh, they were drunk!
Anyway, er  got back to bed
They weren't doing any harm were they?
No.
Just noisy.
Just noisy.
They were just noisy and I thought well  this, I've left my gates open 
Well, it's breaking the law isn't it?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, but by the time you ring the police Ray  and the 
They've gone.
come
By the time they respond you mean!
That's right!
Well, don't .
Then it's all quiet and we've  
Wouldn't be very hard to find them on the streets would it?
Oh no.
And when the police car comes round Ray  and they can't do anything until they actually ca hear them.
They 
Mm.
hide I suppose when they see the
Oh,ye , even if they're just quiet
Mm.
all the police can do is tell them  you know?
They shouldn't be on the 
Yeah.
streets at two o'clock!
Oh!
Why not?
Why not?
Yes  why not?
They could be walking home from anywhere!
Don't walk home!
It's no no they have to be hearing something  they 
Mm.
have to making a nuisance of themselves otherwise the police 
I don't know 
can't
You have to be able to  
I  
the police can't stop you.
What are you 
Oh.
doing?
Yeah!
They can ask that.
The problem is 
As long as you're going somewhere 
we'd gone to bed early  and we'd had our deepest sleep  and of course we were 
I told you that.
our slee , sleep was getting lighter at two o'clock.
Maybe we'd 
That's right!
gone to bed  at half past 
At midnight.
eleven
I wouldn't of heard it.
I would!
I doubt if we'd heard it.
I wouldn't sleep 
Mm.
through that though!
No way!
Well, they moved off and then  just getting back to sleep  must of been half an hour  after we'd  and heard this voice shout  what you doing?
as if erm  no, what's up with you now he said?
That's what it was.
And I looked out the window, I couldn't see anybody  next thing a car moved off  so  whether it was same crowd I don't 
Mm.
know.
But that was all  I mean  after that  there was no  vandalism.
Trouble is when it's so  deadly quiet in the middle of the night as it is 
 
here
And you don't expect it do you?
okay, so it does disturb you.
But, and this is like a  er  a wind tunnel  cos down between the house here
Mm.
sometimes, and if anybody's over there 
You think they're in the back don't you?
it sounds as if they're in the back garden or something!
 
you see.
Mm.
Mm.
And it's because of the  channel between the two houses, and it really does 
Yeah.
literally  come down 
Funnel the sound.
Yeah.
Mm.
And i i it magnifies the sound as it's coming through  so you're lying there and you think, there's somebody in the back!
Plus we've got a leak in one of the erm  er  gutters  I mean, so when it rains it goes drip, drip, drip and it pours down 
Oh yeah.
when it's that bad.
They're only clip , and I mean, I've gotta get up there and
Scrape them out.
They're only clipped together, oh no there is a plastic, the the  new ones.
Oh they're  
Oh, so it's 
It's only clipped together

Three foot  first,.
There were only a few inches 
No it'll be from here

Yo , about the width of your  settee, I would imagine, the house.
Well I didn't think it was that wide.
 
It's ridiculous!
And how high?
Normal height 
It was almost  
As I say it was tapped on to a row.

So there they had to be 
How do you sleep?

Yes.

Is that on the right or the left?
On the right, just set back a bit.
Oh we've seen it, yeah.
But it's a Miller's Kitchen now.
This is between there and then the   Monty's of Leicester 
 Monty's of Leicester Yep!
And it's
Right.
absolutely  it's three ninety five
That's good, yeah!
and
That must be about
it's for your roast.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh well that's 
 
no good to us is it?
No, it's three ninety five 
No, I meant for Ken he's 
is your roast
Ken asked us for 
But you can 
a good place for Sunday Lunch.
there's a choice of two vegetarian meals  which are four twenty five aren't they?
Oh they do, I see that yeah, yeah.
But  what they do, because of the volume
If you want the traditional lunch  you have to have
The roast or 
beef 
whatever or 
which is rib beef, Yorkshire 
Mm.
pudding  and it is
Absolutely nice!
it is nice cos when Brian ordered I said I'll have chicken  and he 
Yeah.
came back and said well you can't have chicken cos   they only   they don't do chicken   and er 
I would preferred the chi 
So you're supposed to have  what
So I had it, and honestly I did enjoy it, and it wasn't tough and it wasn't  you didn't have to chew it!
It was nice and  , I mean you got  ooh quite a lot of beef, and it was nice beef!
Mhm.
And you had  roast potatoes  new potatoes
Yorkshire pudding.
Yorkshi , big Yorkshire pud two veg 
Well carrots and green beans.
and they were fresh weren't they?
Mm.
So it was a nice meal.
That's good!
But it 
That's very cheap!
and the deserts 
got 
no?
No, that was just fo , oh well I mean it's  , but for three ninety five it was just your roast that's it.
But i it was well worth 
Yeah.
that.
I mean 
Well 
it was absolutely choc-a-block!
Well we we're going round  Conways we sa , we'd gone into a pub for erm  we had sort of granary baps didn't we?
And salad.
And we sort of walked round the town and back to where we'd parked the car  and there were  there were places  you know, pubs and cafes which are 
Lot of eating places there and yet is was empty!
Mm.
Well we weren't  anyway there was very few pe , I mean at this time of the year I suppose but  there was one place and it said Sunday lunch, there was a sort of black board outside, Sunday lunch  erm  four pound  was it four fifty  it was four fifty wasn't it?
Think so.
And it was a starter, it was soup for a starter, and it was
There was a sweet board as well.
roast beef  or pork
Mm.
and  a choice of two deserts, which was  treacle pudding or some, whatever else it was!
That's good!
Cos I did look i , I said to Ray, good God!
And we'd paid two ninety five 
Mm.
for our baps and a bit a salad, you know!
And I said really, it's cheaper to have er  a full  you know, I mean you wouldn't want an evening meal obviously 
 
if you had that cos if 
Well it all depends  if it's value for money  because we  er, we fe we felt that it's only one day.
We stopped at this place
You got bulk pra quantity rather than quality in there!
And it was  oh!
Erm  tinned 
two ninety 
meat 
two ninety five wasn't it?
and vegetables!
Oh!
Three course for Sunday lunch.
Mm.
And it was a three co , it was a three course  Sunday lunch.
It was sliced roast beef that comes out of er 
Sliced roast beef 
It looked as if it 
a foil!
it was 
Mm.
like the stuff you get from 
Microwave.
the shop.
Wouldn't eat it!
The Bird's Eye stuff you know?
Already cooked.
Mm.
Erm  and really, you only got what you paid for.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
And we thought we er, we  we should of realised 
That one was cheap.
it was cheap.
Yeah, two, something, like 
Well this  
two something, two sixty five or something!
Mm.
Which is near impossible!
But  said that they went on  Tuesday evening  they had some people over  and they were looking  we were gonna go for a meal in  Chorley er  they'd come over from Grantham, and they were going  over on the night  on the night ferry, on night boat  from Hollyhead.
They were going to Ireland.
Rather than, sort of , go from Manchester by plane  what, they decided they'd drive down  and take the car over  so  we were supposed to be going for a meal  and  they said, where shall we go for a meal?
Well I said  you're going towards  Hollyhead  I'm going towards  North Wales  why not en-route  let's find somewhere and stop and have a meal there, rather than have a meal in  Chorley and have to drive all the way down.
Yes.
And that way, it was sort of an hours drive  from  Chorley to  The Two Mills  for 
Mm.
them.
So they only had two hours further on to go from The Two Mills then  to Hollyhead basically.
Mm.
So  we were gonna go to The Two Mills  but I've heard about the Miller's Kitchen  so I thought, we'll try it.
Anyway  erm  my meal, mine  my two course, I had erm  home-made soup, and you get this erm  massive great wedge 
 
massive wedge of
granary bread  and  and you get your fro ,yo yo your soup  and then I had  er  the home-made steak and kidney pie, you know
Mm.
I mean, I like that  and I had a couple of cups of coffee, I think mine came to about five thirty five.
That's very good though isn't it?
But  I mean, wasn't paying for it, they were paying for it
Mm.
but  by doing it that way, I mean I  Phyl was  er  bowling Tuesday night  and I said I was  probably having a meal out anyway
Mm.
so there was nothing  going to waste  and it was nice for me because once we'd said goodbye  I just had ten minutes, quarter of hour drive home
And you were home.
and I was home.
Mm.
But they had a meal  erm  rather than 
And a break  from the journey.
And a break, yeah.
That's right!
Mm.
So all they had to do then was go on to Hollyhead and they were refreshed  they'd had a meal so they wouldn't be  dying of hunger.
Mm.
So, it worked ideal, and that's when I first found this place  or heard about it well I heard .
No, somebody told us about it didn't they?
Oh yeah!
Jack and Pauline had been er  but we've never  er  ventured to it.
Right.
But on a Sunday  erm  the restaurant is open from  twelve o'clock  so what you've got to  I mean  if you want a table  for say, four or six of you
Mm, you've gotta be there or
you've gotta be there bang on twelve o'clock.
Oh!
I mean 
Otherwise it's gone.
we can have a drink
Because they won't reserve a table I suppose 
No.
will they, no?
But we had ours in er  in erm
In the bar,we the lounge.
In the bar.
Well the la 
The lounge you mean.
The lounge side of the bar.
It was very nice!
It was very nice where we were wasn't it?
And it's all been modernised the place has  and there's a  a nice  if you've got a  a family, a young family
Mm.
or  there's six or seven of you together 
Yeah, there's a family room I think  or something
you'd got 
in there.
four or five tables which overlook the garden.
Mm.
They got the french windows and i , it looks  it i , really is nice!
Nice setting then.
Yeah!
Er  but then they got an upstairs as well.
It really is  nice!
And er  it's certainly value for money.
Mm.
Well it's funny because erm, when we saw Ken the other day he was saying that erm  his niece rang him up  and erm  she's er  she's gonna be in Crewe this  weekend  for a friend's wedding  and, I think she must be coming up with some, some other girl as well, because the two of them, he said, I'm taking two young ladies out on Sunday for lunch  where's a good place for a Sunday lunch you see?
So we were sort of wondering, you know, where 
Mm.
to recommend  so, I mean, I said well I don't know about that  you know, the Toby Inn, I mean  I know it's a 
Mm.
all a chain aren't they?
But er  in North of Hull, cos he said I don't wanna go too far
No.
erm  and somewhere sort of reasonable.
I mean ee  it's awkward for him now because I mean  he's  he's not a dab hand like some men, like they, he likes messing about with menus and  you know
  
In the kitchen he 
Yeah.
I mean he  only likes a very simple diet himself, so  he doesn't 
He would eat 
experiment with food at all.
He would eat the roast wouldn't he?
So he couldn't do anything  oh,ye well yeah!
He probably just wouldn't 
But 
eat the vegetables!
Yeah, but 
wo 
yes he'd just have to  I mean, peas and potatoes that'll be the limit!
These girls you see, they might  they might  
In the vegetables.
and er
Well I said to him,
Well he can have  he can have lasagne and chips couldn't he?
They cou , they could have all the 
They do a 
Yeah.
vegetarian meal.
There's two 
Oh I'm sorry!
really nice vegetarian meals on the 
I thought you meant 
menu.
Ken ?
Well, no darling I was gonna say  Ken he sort of suggested 
He can't er 
he said, I I'm wondering whether to do a meal myself at home.
He can't that!
He couldn't .
Even if it's somebody else you know.
Erm  well I said it's a bit awkward really 
so er 
because I mean
Shame really!
Yeah it is.
It is a shame!
Like
You know sometimes
I mean I'd
especially today!
They're perhaps vegetarian or something 
I'd teach him if wanted but er 
unless you know 
I think this is all  maybe go for a while  
he might have done a roast dinner  and that they  
Yeah.
you know, they don't want meat!
And you're stuck then 
That's right.
I said, and i , if you do take them out it's 
the plaice.
you can have a choice
Oh yes!
of course.
Well Margaret won't.
So
They'll make you salad 
 
a light salad if you like.
and he wanted 
That's right yeah.
I mean if he a a steak  and they had something 
Well yes 
else.
that's what he's having.
Yes, well this is it.
But they haven't got any money.
If you're eat 
I mean you 
well, that's it, it's good value isn't it really?
Oh I'll have to tell him about that.
So it's the Miller's 
 
kitchen?
The Miller's Kitchen.
It's it's the old Yacht.
Near the pub.
Ye , I should 
There.
think so, yeah.
You've gotta 
Well turn right
turn right at the Two Mills 
Two Mills  and it's
depends when he wants to go.
it's that pub.
What day is it?
Sunday, isn't it?
They're coming in 
Oh it's the Su 
the wedding's on Saturday and they're coming up 
Oh I se , oh alright.
That's why I thought 
On Sunday 
might as well have it 
Well that might do then mightn't it?
By the other two.
That's what he said  where's a good place for Sunday lunch you see?
So they'll 
Nice setting.
be there in the morning and
It is a nice setting  erm  and  three of them together 
Give him a ring now.
Yeah  Well it's a
What for?
Well in case you don't see him, you know, in time.
Well I probably will see him!
I'm not gonna ring him tomorrow, it's Wednesday!
But if you fa 
Well I just thought sorry!
and if you fancy it one Sunday
You're gonna get 
Give us , give us a shout.
a smack round the back the of head in a minute!
and we'll plan it.
No, it was good value wasn't it?
It was, yeah.
But I think I would pay the extra and that  and have a choice next time.
Ah, well you can do!
It was just I wanted to see what that was 
Mm.
like 
Mm.
well you can pay the extra.
I mean we we just 
 
we just don't like beef now.
I'd eat 
No.

I don't mind now and again.
And these are nice thinly sliced  and it was nice beef!
It was nice roast dinner!
Very  
You're having ro roast beef.
And you didn't have to chew it.
No.
I mean 
Mm.
I hate it when you get  mm  chewing it.
But that oh it wasn't bad 
It just tastes of Indian rubber!
Mm.
It was nice!
It was good value.
I'd sooner have cold meat than .
But there's so many choices  I mean you could have what you wanted.
I'd sooner not have any beef at all!
Well, I, no, I mean  I used to love lamb!
Mm  lamb's tasty though 
Brought up on ruddy 
isn't it?
lamb for the weekend!
I dunno it's !
We always had a lamb  leg of lamb.
Cos we had to have lamb for years!
Famous Welsh lamb.
And we had some of
And then cold lamb after 
Pat's son invited us round for dinner, I never thought so say you know!
That was tradition in them days.
Don't do anything  
That's what they did.
That's what people did.
particular for us
You know  we used to have some a while ago.

But erm  she did this roast lamb 
 
and  ahhh The pair of us were 
It's too fatty!
rolling around!
And I said, gives him indigestion dunnit?
Mm.
Just couldn't eat it, I sa it was all 
 
fatty!

You know, it took ages to digest!
I mean we eat that much veg vegetables 
It is fatty!
And I thought it was just me, but Ray was the 
and chicken 
same.
Mm.
fish.
We probably get used to that.
Well that's it!
Well that's it and i i i 
And you don't really want the rest.
It's an easily digestible 
Yeah.
Mm.
And then they have steak !
Erm  food.
I had a black pudding this morning.
Good 
Mm.
grief!
Yeah.
All that cholesterol Brian!
I could eat hundreds !
Ah, but think of iron.
That's what the doctor told me to eat  didn't he?
What, black pudding?
Black pudding.
Mm.
Ooh, I tell you what you want though.
For the iron?
Got a 
Yeah.
couple of things for you.
You want water from, where was it I said to you?
From er
Lourdes!
No, no!
From nor , somewhere in Snowdonia  they send this water all over the country  and it's so full of iron  Germany, they buy it  .
But er, it's a good  I don't know about cure, but whatever!
Dunno, something you read 
The rheuma 
in the paper yesterday.
I told you on Su on Sunday!
Mm, I've forgotten now.
Er, rheumatism, what else was it?
I dunno, I didn't read it!
Something else like that, you know, but the iron in it is marvellous!
Because it's rich the
Mm.
the earths it comes out of so they're selling it by the bottle in Germany.
Mm.
The other thing you got  vitamin G was it?
D!
Gonna say, I've never heard of G, what's that?
Vitamin B one.
Very good for you!
Good for the liver.
Is that what's in this water?
Oh no this is
No!

But they're doing a
You might as well just buy 
a series up in the er
iron and multi-vitamin or  jus just iron tablets!
in the Observer you see, and they're telling you 
You've got  
all these, the good
I dunno whether they  whether you have to absorb these 
How to live till you're a hundred you know, live a good life.
And this  all the these things 
thickenings really.
course the emphasis is on don't smoke!
Well
drink  and all that 
I know they do say if you eat a balanced diet you shouldn't need supplements.
plenty of er, you know pulses and cereals.
Mm.
But I think when you get a certain age 
Which is plain most of things 
 
cos you do need supplements 
that's what you're eating mainly anyway!
er
That's right!
Yeah.
But I mean, do you actually absorb them do you?
I think occasionally we do.
I mean, they say you're supposed 
Is it fortified?
the best way to have these vitamins in with 
Be nice though wouldn't it?
To be 
with your diet  cos it, then he gives all 
be able to 
Yeah.
not have to 
 
worry about any of it?
So instead of swallowing vitamin C tablets just 
Eat what you want 
use a main  juice all ti 
the way we used to.
or eat more oranges.
No, I mean if er 
 
vegetarian pulses  vegetables

Plus, you have to do all your own tape back-ups!

Well, he used to do other jobs as well!
Mm.
And you really mi don't 
Miss

Oh, he left of his own accord?
He wasn't pushed?
Yeah, he lo , left 
 
of his own accord.
You're welcome.
I've heard you selling the guy that showed you these two manifestos  one by the Tories and one by the Labour  and the one that stuck in my mind  it's that the Labour Party will have a minimum wage  to comply with the rest of Europe.
Tories saying, if they have a minimum wage it will tear a lot of people out of work.
And cause unemployment.
What a bloody disgrace when you're in a democracy and they want  minimum 
Pathetic!
wage!
So you can employ someone for
Peanuts!
ten pounds!no law against    the swines!
God help them!
Shows you that  .
Oh this is disgusting!
Yes,.
mm.
Mm, mm mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Don't  do that!
That's when accidents happen Brian!
That's what   oh that's alright for you!
Hit my bloody shoe that will!
I like to know  about this polyunsaturated  thing?
What do you want to know about it?
Well this  Carrie was on today about it.

Are you sti , are you taking it?
Still have spread on your bed  bread?
No.
Well not  not if I have salad on it, anyway.
You didn't  
No, I didn't put any on.
It's only Brian's.
It's for me who put it on.
Do you see, do you see what was written on the olive oil bottle and it says it's got  polyunsaturates.
Cos I thought it pure, you know ?
It's supposed to be.
Natural.
Oh!
Natural!
They don't put animal fat in it, surely do they?
Mm.
They 
Ay

Some vegetable fat 
They add a

Very bad for you!
And when

Saffron.
oil.
Mm.
What about rapeseed oil?
Isn't that very
No, didn't say that.
Mm.
Rapeseed that
Well they had a 
 
 
list of what to eat, and a list of  list of what not to eat.
And I'm eating all the stuff I shouldn't be eating!
Not tonight.
Josephine!
So I  I only saffra , saffrall oil now  or olive oil.
Mhm.
I didn't realise that 
What about sunflower oil?
 
No  not sunflower oil.
No good?
It's better than er  animal fat.
All the vegetable fats are better than the animal 
Mm.
fat.
Yes, of course!
Be, I mean 
Oh well we shouldn't have any rust.
No.
You think you're doing the right thing by eating  olive oil  pure oils but
Another twenty years, there'll be another turnabout 
Ah yeah!
won't there ?
Saying, you should be eating butter!
Should be 
Well it said 
drinking  whole milk!
it said in the paper this week  that  erm  broccoli  is the finest  vegetable you can eat.
The finest green you can eat.
Mm.
And it helps  stave off cancer, didn't it?
Well it helps fight 
It did kind of like  whatever!
it helps fight  the cancer cells it 
Mm.
said.
Where fats  encourage it.
Er greens.
But it specifically said
Broccoli.
Broccoli.
But  when tha , when the doctor was on in the morning, the doctor said it's the same as the carotene in carrot 
Yeah, and not actually 
I was just going to say they said carrots 
not actually  
a while ago didn't they?
Was the
Said it's the 
Not  
same  it's the same sort of thing.
And really the doctors have known that for years because  a lot of cancer patients they put on  er 
Diets.
vegetable  diets.
They can't have chocolate  they can have this erm  what's it called?
Not  cova , is it  coba or something?
This natural chocolate.
They can't have cakes  they can't have anything  that's got fats in it.
Oh!
One minute they say you can't eat , and then they say that you can eat it!
Yeah!
I think you've gotta try and strike a balance haven't you?
You'll get paranoid if you
Well  I think we all are to a certain extent!
It's not knowing isn't it?
Everything in moderation 
 
is my answer .
It's just some people that eat everything they live till they're ruddy  seventy or it's  makes you wonder!
Yeah, but I suppose they have to go by  the general rule
Oh yes!
but I mean, you'll always find exceptions won't you?
I'll go along with that.
Well I'm not gonna last too much longer!
Much longer!
If I eat another thing that's bad for me!
You don't Brian!
You
No, I do , I eat, I eat plenty of fruit  and  occasionally I'll have  a bag of chips.
Very, very occasionally!
We have  we have erm  fresh vegetables every day.
Mm.
And black pudding!
You're pretty active though aren't you?
No.
No.
You're not very active?
Well I am
But not me.

you're still fit.
I will up  I will up your insurance!
Yeah.
Get the policy 
 
and get him to sign before he does anything else!
And stress!
Mm.
Stress is probably  a greater factor than has been allowed for up to now.
Yes , but don't  women   
You won't actually get 
give a lot of stress to men?
Pressure!
I'm, I'm just asking the question!
Brian's not here enough to take any sp pressure from me!
I mean, they probably don't!
He's not here long enough!
He works one and half shifts, or two double shifts  .
You stick with me!
Well, better than being !
That'll keep you in black pudding for a while, Brian!
Carol's friends  he doesn't though!
He doesn't get paid overtime.
It's erm  these friends of ours, Judith and Peter, they've retired.
They 
Early retirement.
Oh the one  from Manchester?
Yeah.
Oh well.
They retired the sixth of March.
Had they sold  the boarding house?
Or have they 
No they've got a hotel.
Have they?
Hotel, yeah.
I thought you were gonna say the children are having it.
No, they sold it and er
So what, what are they gonna do?
Nothing.
They've got enough money not to   
Worry.
Mind you, they've worked hard for
Mm.
quite a few years, haven't they, to build that place up?
Sold herself to death that girl won't she?
Quite possible !
Well she's 
But 
only  she's only about forty eight  and Peter's about 
This yours?
fifty five or fifty 
He's fifty five.
six.
She was a heavy smoker wasn't she?
Mm.
But they've got the mobile home 
She is a heavy smoker , is she still?
in there.
In the lakes  so, they're gonna spend as much time as they can  round the 
Up there.
the lakes walking, which they love anyway.
Mind you, I think the last few years they  they'd sort of erm  relaxed a bit more 
Mm.
hadn't they?
Mm.
Yeah.
But Peter used to rush home on a  on a Sunday  for the hotel for  for the guests that were coming in Sunday .
Monday morning you see, yes.
Or Sunday afternoon  
Oh I see yeah.
Start er, work on a Monday wouldn't they, yeah?
Well it's  one of those occupations or businesses  that he had to be there more or less 
  
well while he was building it up.
Sure.
Round the clock wasn't it?
It was  no holidays  for a 
But they 
few years.
they sold it  for quite a bit of money  and
Well when he was thinking of selling it before he was talking about three hundred thousand.
Yeah.
So I bet he's come away with a quarter of a million!
Oh yeah, the guy that  he hasn't reduced it at all!
He hasn't?
Oh well he's asked them  what he was asking for it then?
Mm.
This guy wanted it.
Did it take him very long to sell it?
A chap saw it in  November, no!
Sorry, September  and really they weren't  bothered about selling at that time  although they always said if the right offer comes along
Mm.
anyway, they went away and  this chap saw it  and er  he made an offer and Peter  flatly refused it!
They went away on their  silver wedding  was it their silver?
In October  Novem 
They went on a cruise round the Caribbean didn't they for 
It was November wasn't it?
for three weeks or something?
Yeah, well that was their silver wedding anniversary wasn't it?
Mm.
And they came back and  didn't hear anything.
Anyway, just after Christmas this guy says er  I still want  the hotel  so Peter said well you better put something down, you ge , better get something  so he  he went and put fifty thousand  as a deposit on it  and  then said  his legal  advisers would be in touch  and they had a month went by and they never heard anything, so Peter rang up, he was telling me the other day, er, he rang up  yeah, go, he doesn't want it you know?
Did he, did he have a  the buyer have to  sell some property?
No.
Oh!
No, nothing!
Anyway, erm  he got a letter, erm  when was it?
Gi , he got a letter  a fortnight ago to say  he wanted a completion date  of the sixth of March!
This  this  this chap 
My birthday!
did  and erm  everything was through  the money, everything, went in that fortnight!
Er, they had to be out
So that was quite quick then really 
Mm.

So, they may  Mm.

have to.
And be involved in something.
Oh well go back to the
Should be very nice to have the money.

I'm not bitter!
Grinding the teeth!
I mean he  he spent a lot of money on the last few years on the hotel  cos he had  six extra rooms built on didn't he?

A sauna.
It was quite a good little ear , I mean it was a commercial hotel  and 
Mm.

About seventeen years was it?
Yeah, because it's only half 
It may be about that.

Mm.
it was 
Initially.
half, it was a big house and the they bought half of it.

It worked out and then they only lived in the other half while they were doing it, wasn't it?
Then they bought the whole lot.
No!
They had half 
They converted all of it then did they?
They lived in the basement.
That's right, they lived in the basement.
They bought half  excuse me  half of it  and they lived in the basement, then the other half came up for sale so Peter bought  the whole lot then 
Building  mm.
and then converted it into a  you know, sort of, a modest  hotel.
Mm.
And er
Well obviously he's built up his clientele over the years

How long ago was that?
Two years ago.
Mm.
Well about that.
And the they  they keep saying to us, why don't you use it.
You see in the  lakes  mm, I mean you pay much more though 
Oh yeah, you pay for the site.

Yeah.
This is the thing.
Cos it is a nice site 
Mm.
Got everything piped on there  so

You can go up for the day.
Oh yes, but you can't
Not continuously occupy it.
But you're not
No.
sleeping 
Mm.
there.
And they like the  erm  the water, excuse me!they like the water drained out  the site, you know, they like it sort of all the water switched off on, on each van
Oh yeah!
through the winter
Mm.
so there's no  there not gonna be any 
Freeze up.
any problems at all 
Mm.
they can drain the whole system on the site so
I mean you 
 
can go up there if you were going to stay and make a cup of tea and a  sandwich or something.
So you're taking your water with you.
Well you'd have to take a car er
Kettle of water.
water.
So is there somebody on the site all the time 
Oh yeah 
then?
there's a resident
Mm.
erm  site manager there.
I think he opens the  no, he can't do it on the site cos it's in er  what is it?
National Trust.
National Trust  land so  
Well where they are you can only see a , one other van can't you?
Yet there's loads there, it's just the way the  .
Oh it's on an elevated spot is it or the 
Well sort, there sort of like little coves aren't they and  they're  you can only just see one van from where they are.
Oh that's nice because it's 
Mm.
private .
Oh yeah!
I mean we had er
It's like being in the woods isn't it?
marvellous time didn't we?
Mm.
It was so quiet!
Erm, until it rained  and when it rains 
And then it drums on the roof then!
Ahhh
Mm.
Bloody hell, I mean you
Especially in the night!
It's all it's all trees.
But the they're fine in the summer.
But they're hellish  cold in the winter!
Mm.
Yes  yeah.
Erm  but they are colder than a caravan!
Well , I mean they're only thin walls aren't 
Mm.
they?
But cos 
Ooh aye 
they're so long  erm  they always seem colder  than a caravan  although it didn't 
We've never been in the winter  that was whe I wouldn't know!
No, I mean when we went up it was  it wasn't  erm  winter time  it was  late summer wasn't it, when we went up?
It wasn't so warm.
I love 
Mm.
a bit of cold!
And  i it felt damp.
Mm.
And if you wake up in the morning  and all the condensation 
It didn't!
Oh the windows were, but it never felt damp!
It did to me the first time we stayed.
Just weren't used to it you see.
Well there wouldn't 
Oh yeah.
be any heating in the bedrooms, I don't suppose, would there be?
Just a
No, it didn't have a radiator in the bedroom .
The heaters are erm, in the kitchen or the lounge area I suppose.
Well it's   
Nice to spend time in the  in the warm weather though.
Mm.
I think I would have  bought something a bit more substantial at it, I mean, if you've that amount of money, they must have a fair amount of money
No, they didn't, though, no.
The money was tied up.
Well er, I know what you mean 
It was all tied up.
and  I understand that because I, I'd  probably feel like that, I'd sooner invest in bricks and mortar even if were only a little end-terrace house 
Yep!
Yep.
than a caravan  or a mobile home on a site.
You see they, they've only got so long on this site with that van
Mm.
and then they've either got to replace the van
Mm.
Pardon me !
But erm, on that  site, he's pretty good the manager there.
They've only got six years.
No!
Tha , as long as you  keep it 
Oh yes!
maintained 
Mhm.
Mm.
they'll let you  leave it on longer.
But 
They 
otherwise is it normally just a six year
Well I thought it 
Normally.
was ten?
No, no!
It's normally six years  then you replace your vans on the sites.
That's the way 
Oh it's not six years!
You'd tell us anything 
It doesn't seem very long does it?
For six 
Peter told us it was six
You couldn't spend sixteen thousand and leave it there for six years!
Course you can!
And wha you'd have to re 
It was longer than six, six years!
It wasn't  
I think it was ten years!
Take no 
Ah.
notice of him!
It was six years Peter mentioned!
You're not a reliable source 
No he didn't!
of information Brian sorry!
Get your facts 
He mentioned six years to me!
Rubbish!
He mentioned six years!
Rubbish!
He mentioned six years to me!
 
Rubbish!
I'll tell you!
I'll mention six years to you!
You won't live another six years to find out!
Oh oh oh God !
Kept up with the insurance policy!
Ahhh !
Cooking down to you boy!
Might I go to the toilet mam
No!
No, no!
Take that microphone with you so we can hear what your doing!
 
Will you stop it?
You haven't still got it on have you?
No!
Hopeless  with that on because  of course, he's been  wearing a pullover all the time and  initially he had it clipped on the right hand side of his belts  and of course , with that switch  where is it?
The red switch  there  being  right on the end  when you depress that the play switch goes down as well.
But with him having on this side, because he's so blooming awkward  he's been pressing the play switch  and of course, so the tapes been turning round, haven't bothered to che , so  you know, he was sort of saying well  well play that tape and I'll  write their names down of the people as they speak, just the first names, you know  so there's loads of
loads of blank spaces on these tapes !
You're best just putting it on a table Margaret.
And the rest of the time  he's had this, sort of on, on the pullover here and of course it's so sensitive that it  it picks up every  rustle!
I mean  he was talking to Norman  over the fence the other day and it sounds like gunfire
In  in the microphone you know !
Every now and again the  voice comes in.
I mean, it was a windy day as well and I don't think that helped because the wind was sort of blowing into the mike  but er  and when he took it to college there was this noise all the time, he must have had it clipped under here somewhere!
I said, well you know it's gotta be 
I'll put the kettle on for you Brian.
it's gotta be  outside  the clothing !
But erm
Well it's, it's alright, I mean
Well  er, I think probably, I mean i so , this lady came on Friday and she's coming on Friday of this week to collect it  or collect the tapes
Mm.
and she said  you know, use as many as you can which  which we have done   and a lot of blank spaces on them !
You haven't got  er 
Er 
Top of the Pops on one of these?
Mm mm, no no, no.
No?
Or Radio Two,tried but er  but erm  he's got sort of better.
I mean, today we've been to  well we went into Henry and Norman's and they were  having a chat  and it's better if you're just sitting down like this with a mike just  you know 
Oh yeah!
not attached really because it is very sensitive 
Ooh ooh yes!
and I mean, unless yo , and they said don't clip it near your throat because  it would   I felt like clipping it round his throat !
It er  it would interfere with the erm 
Are you taping about that ?
with the reproduction so
You've gotta go you have!
You're coming very close Brian!
She's trying to get rid of me, I'm sure she is!
You're not are you chuck
She doesn't mean it really!
No, course she doesn't mind!
Anyway, how about a car boot sale on 
But

Ee, you , actually I left my boot open and there were five cars behind me, so he said well if we get our spaces nicked .
That's right.
I still got a free one.
Isn't there a mail box here in the college?
I don't think so.
It's on the way 
Oh!
Should be one!
Would of thought
Well, are those your chairs?
Yes, ah, these
Are they?
Ten minutes to go.
It's too high get it back on the chair!
It'll be too high.
Yes.
Oh I see, yes yes yes.
Well it's so many things!
It's higher than the one I  had because erm  the base is  obviously I just had the  springs going across didn't I?
Yeah I, I sa I've erm  cos I'm gonna  reduce the 
Mm.
base, you know the  spring unit what you were talking about.
That's right.
If you can get them up 
Yeah that was
high,
Yeah.
So I can   
So you done it with springs, that's right 
Yes 
yeah.
just  you know
Is it just cos it's  you're a lady anyhow, I mean she co 
I mean a 
probably not big enough for a man.
I wouldn't say  I wouldn't say anything Gwyneth, to me i , I'd be quite happy!
But then  Joan is speaking on  how it should look.
What she said was  the head was
Oh I see, too high?
Yes.
Well it wouldn't be for you would it?
Well not really.
It depends on  doesn't it?
Those  Ercoles that we got, those  wing  they're too  they're too low for me.
I think they are  
Surprising, yeah.
inches.
No, they're not made for a tall man er, you know my 
No.
wife's quite 
and your 
happy but  my head's like this and I I  bit disappointed really 
Well that's the trouble!
I thought that they were  the wings were gonna come up  you know, the, the old type that kept the draught off.
Which 
You wouldn't have draughts, you have double glazing!
Well that's the thing you see but er 
If you have double glazing.
Oh dear!
Now I've  
No, but erm 
Well I 
That's what I anticipated, but that, yes that's lovely !
Be quite happy 
She said 
with that.
she said we didn't  but she's on her own.
I'm not  
Yeah.
but she's nice isn't she?
She'll be al , yes, that's right, yeah, yeah.
You see these are one size anyhow, cos
The wings, are they?
When it comes in it's hand made which
Yes, I see 
and he made it, you see  I mean i it cost over  twenty years ago told me  I think those were too small.
Small, yes, they should of been a bit 
Well, I mean she knows that 
deeper really, so that the 
knows that well I'm not   I mean, why should I?
It's different.
Nice!
Yeah.
Not only that erm  I mean you could
I think she'll be very happy.
Yeah, I think so.
Yes.
I think, you know in 
 
certain cases you've gotta say to Joe, well you mean that's what the lady wants now  you know those  Ercoles I did?
Well she convinced me to start off  with foam, you know  webbing on the foam and I said well 
Yes.
she said it's a lot cheaper  and easier, so I hadn't got the springs at that time
No.
You re , you really
but then er  somebody said  don't do that  you've gotta think what the value
That's right.
of how it's 
Definitely!
supposed to me.
See, I did it 
So 
once
in the end I persevered 
when I first came  when I first came, that was the one thing that I was  like  that  was the fact that  that I might be pushed  that way  whereas  I only 
Mm.
really nice  he's thinking that  I mean that, he couldn't never lift the seat up.
Oh it's gorgeous!
That's why I love the  sprung hair and the horse hair ideally, you know I love it!
I mean, do you know
Now that'd be better for me 
better for you
but then I  as I say, you don't cater for every height on the 
Whe 
chair do you?
When I went to Noreen's  if I make that to be used with a cushion or without
Mm.
she can always put the cushion over the 
Yes.
and then take it off the chair .
Well it , ah well, of course the other thing you'd have to do to do that is put a top
Oh I'll do that in there.
Oh that's what you're doing is it?
I've got enough material.
Oh well!
I've got enough material.
So you're gonna give this a top stuffing?
Yes.
No, I'm gonna give that a top cover for this .
Yeah.
That's what I want.
I see, just one, I see yeah.
That's right.
So all you want is a bit of erm
on the side  you know, piece of wadding
Wadding.
I've got the both types.
Well that's great!
I've got the narrow  and I've got the thick.
That's great!
So she can please herself can't 
Mm.
she?
And you can make 
I think the 
that  loose.
Yeah, and then 
Good!
she, if she wants a cushion she can put it on, and 
You're happy!
Joan's happy!
That's right.
Everyone's .
That's a good idea that!
That's, that's got one.
You've got in effect, a dual purpose
Mm.
chair  haven't you?
I if I set it up there
It's too low is it, for you?
Well
I see yes.
The height from there
Oh yes, I see, yeah.
isn't it?
Mm, yes.
 

It's that comfortable it's actually going off to sleep here!
You'd better get some work done you know .
I had to get her out of bed this morning!

And that  
The golden rule is if you're reversing you must look behind you!

I think the 
you when you learnt to drive  when you came to reversing you're told you must look
Yeah.
out of that rear window all the time  not using your rear view mirrors  look once as well.
That's what a lot of people do,the , they look once and then turn forward and bang!
It's fatal!
Cos anyone can whizz in behind you!
And she's got no chance if she told the truth!
Of course, the other thing, if she says oh well I er  didn't know this feller was moving and er
Yeah  they're never going

The attitude , which is wrong 
Yeah.

You still got the 
fifth!
same  overheads
Heating.

compost and  all of that.
And the work is  tremendous 
Yeah.
doing that sort of thing, I'd, something I would never take but there you are that's people for you!

Like this game to some extent isn't it?
The furniture they want it  somebody'll want it done for no

and that hasn't broke.
No, no, you've been lucky there but

Michael  the erm  the up , the furniture restorer that's erm  he's coming here.
He's not here.

.
He's written a book.
We've all got the book.

I see!
to get this
Teaching?
other exam.
Yeah.
As I say, they  he qualifies you see.
Yeah.
Er  so it's mainly erm  what I've just been telling you about  cleaning  all 
Mm.
screws, how to identify furniture and  mainly ol and his methods are totally different to  what we've learnt 
 
here, especially with polishing 
Mm, mm 
and that.
Mm.
Uses hardly any polish  it's nearly all waxing though.
Is it?
Oh!
Stripping and everything's a different technique.
Oh very good!
But he 
And that's part of your three days is it?
You do three don't you?
Yeah, ah that's right, yeah.
Well er, the Tuesday is supposed to be  furniture restoration, that's what it's been
And yo , that's  
but then he started doi you know, a few weeks ago it wa , well it'll be the fourth week I should think!
Mm.
And 
Fourth.

Furniture restoration.
Well that's the  the three day, you know, George i he's  
George, Bill and
No, Bill doesn't go in!

And that's on Tuesday mornings?
Tuesdays.
Yeah, yeah 
Oh I see!
It's a fiver each that is.
Some 
I wouldn't mind doing that.
Well, I I liked it, you know it's  it's so interesting and er  he is very good!
Trouble is, some of them have made the mistake I think, of saying well  it's not good for us because we don't do really old furniture you know.
Nobody's gonna come to us for the lease of erm  William the fourth or anything like this!
No.
Or William and Mary and say er  can you do, they're gonna go to an expert like him.
But then  if they got tips
You never know, you might have to do a  top of an 
Yeah.
old, really old 
Yeah.
table.
And not just go on and strip the  
Yeah.
which
Yeah.
he's still really  tha that's a 
Yeah, you ca 
of him that is.
No.
Don't, never use that stuff!
Makes his own wax!
Does he?
Showing us how to 
Yeah.
we're gonna do some  between us.
So if he's got to  he's ga got to re re-buy something then he just clips it down with sandpaper does he?
Oh no!
No, just  cli , and yesterday he'd got this marvellous cleaner he uses.
Just wipes it.
It just cleans.
Cleaner  and then er  wire wool at  at the last 
Mm.
resort
Mm.
but  oh he he, he does do stripping obviously but the 
Yeah.
the stuff he uses is ve isn't as  caustic as the stuff we 
No.
use.
No.
It just takes the surface off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then th , the object in the, is to build up a pattern 
Yeah.
there you see, so it still looks old.
And he 
Yeah.
does a lot of patching, somebody's got a  cigarette hole you, you've gotta match that up.
Yeah.
Very interesting!
Yeah.
But it would 
 
 pricey If I wanted to come you see, I'd have to pay again!
Oh well , yes, yeah, oh well I wouldn't be coming.
I'd have , I'd have to pay for it.
I have to 
That's right.
pay for everything I do, you know.
It's part of my second year, so  yeah I know.
Yeah.
So I'll be in the same boat as you next year.
Will you?
Well yeah, I've had a  come for one day, pay for a day and hope I can  sneak in on the two day.
That's what 
Ya.
you can do.
Mm.
Yeah well we could
I mean, Joan said well ma , you know make the numbers up, once you're here  come in on the second.
Well we can still be away for about four lessons at four thirty so er
Well that makes up
and he'd been away for three months so that you know I mean  
Well you see Eric was offered two months.
Little Eric, the one that's always 
Yeah.
in there.
So the  let him come in the day, two days  he was off two months, Christmas time,
How is he?
with his bad back.
Tha , well he went to Spain for a month to sort of recuperate.
Yes.
And  and come in on the, he came on the Tuesday and he's been three days a couple of weeks so   
Eric will be pleased at that.
Between friends I think  
I haven't got a bad back, she had me
Wings on  you would wouldn't you?
Ooh yes!
Yes.
The wings go on last don't 
Last 
they?
yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Ray, can I ask you ?
Sorry Pat, what?
Have you got glue from the
No.
Yes.
Kept this space 
There?
specially for you Pat.
Oh that's very sweet!
With you in mind.
Well erm  Mary's 
 
here  so she can budge up a bit.
Yes.
A gem you are!
There's usually another guy here today so he hasn't showed up, so there you are so  we got bags of room.
From what I've heard she'd got no chance that lady!
Well yes.
As long as you're alright.
Bit shocked really I suppose.
Yes, well it is!
Yo you sort of er  if you ran into someone you know, you do something silly it's it's it's  it's automatic to say oh I'm sorry  we will  you know how much
Yeah.
?
Yeah.
But today, especially these youngsters the attitude is I'm 
Yeah.
not saying anything!
Course it is, you say anything 
Now it's sticking out a mile, but the time home that make up another ruddy story to give 
Yeah.
to their insurance I mean 
Oh yeah.
it's awful.
But 
Oh she blamed me, she said I was coming round the corner  at high speed!
And I, we weren't anywhere near the corner!
We were this end  sorry, we were this end, you know  .
Yo you were stationery were you?
I was stationery.
She got no chance!
You ran into a , I mean  if she's reversing
She reversed  
She's not looking, she couldn't of been looking!
She's she's looked then she's taken her eyes off the back.
Yeah.
Must of!
Well, she probably didn't look at all!
Could be.
I mean I I
I said, I hooted her as well.
Mm.
And er
That's fatal!
But I I was always taught, probably like yourself that you must look through that, turn round and look through that rear
Yes.
mirror.
Cos if you take your eye off for a second, bang somebody's there!
Oh yes.
So I don't think she's got much hope now you know.
Have you got 
 
witnesses anyway?
Yeah .
Oh!
I hope sa er  , see of course it's all question of getting it sorted out as quickly as you can.
There's the insurances and the tale that she tells them but tha , I think they'll have that weighed up you know.
Ha!
Well I hope so.
Cos I had an awful experience about  ooh, four years ago, I had this old  Moggy Morris Minor  coming along very slowly  north of Hull it was  and this chap and his  about finished work you know, so I  going past this  cri , there's a cricket match going on  and he was looking like, I could see  and his girlfriend!
And the car just went like this  into the middle of the road slowly  towards me  I swerved  onto the  grass 
Yeah.
verge  and he caught my back bumper an an ripped it off you see!
Got out the car, said good God lad what were you doing?
And he never said anything and he said  something like, I'm not saying anything.
I said  you ran into me, look at the position of the cars!
Ooh no, he said we'll swop insurances that's all he'd say!
It was his dad's car.
Yeah.
His dad was on holiday.
Anyway, I, I should of got the police there and then and had 
Yeah.
him breathalysed although it wasn't 
Yeah.
drink or anything but 
Yeah.
police said to me afterwards you should of  we can't fight your claim  you 
Yeah.
should of had him there and then and measured up the road a bit 
Yeah.
we could see how
Yeah.
you're too late  to have ended up knock for knock.
It's as though 
Yeah.
it were partially my blame you know.
They paid half  of erm 
Yeah.
totally his fault you know!
But these youngsters today they could kill 
Yeah.
someone they wouldn't er

Trouble is she only wants to buy it off you cheaply you see, for
If you can, it's how she does it, she might erm
Sometimes they sell things for you don't they?
And charge you  for it.
That's what I was gonna say, I she liked that new erm   in there.

That's right.
loss.

Especially at lunch with the  they come up and spend 
Ooh yes.
little bit on , they're still buying.
Ooh yes!
Because they're going  they go by the band road  down south.

We bought , we bought stuff ourselves you know, to people and we've spent on it, so
Yeah.
It's my last weekend  but it was such a scramble!

Mm.
be bothered but erm
Yeah.
Well you know the erm   Handbridge ?
Yes.

Over the bri , oh I know yes!
A 
anyway 
that they call  Vineholts  Vineholts is a cake shop right opposite there.
Oh yes , that's right yes.
Well I hadn't been there for ages!
Have you got a a row of shops on your left  by the pub
Yes, and then on the right 
then er er a park on your right and 
right.
then a couple of the shops, and she's about on the corner this
Oh, well I haven't been that way yet.
Just a couple of ladies erm  well it's one lady, I think er  the lady just helps her.
We've been in a couple of times and I said that I wanted a chaise you see  ooh I got this  erm  one for   Victorian one  it's very nice, and lovely warm  you know, the legs  anyway it was one  one thousand three hundred you see, so I thought, oh  I said well  I didn't wanna 
I beg your pardon?
Well that's what you can spend now for a good one.
But this is ready to take home  but  I said oh, can I have it out?
She said, yes.
That's finished is it then?
Oh yes, yes!
Had to be.
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Only one seat then?
Oh yes yeah.
I said to her have you got one that's in bits?
But er  for three hundred, you know   er  but  er er
But
the back was loose!
And I said, and she said oh well  she said you know well it's  that's how you've gotta take it stripped, for me to take that to get that  done up by a restorer  you'd have to take all the upholstery off, or quite a bit off
Well I was gonna say
and then if it'd go up to about one seven she said, and I couldn't sell it here she said, I'm not Chester prices  I'm just that bit cheaper.
Which, a lovely lady!
But 
But 
I thought, I was surprised to see it was loose, you know.
Well that's it, I mean the joints 
You've gotta take it home like that.
the joints have got to be done haven't they?
The joints have gone and this wanted doing but  it would of been extortionate she said, you know, to get it done
Yeah.
and then try and sell it  you know, take 
Well that's alright.
all that into account.
I think it's terrible really!
That's bad!
And I've seen chairs like that, I've seen  I don't know whether it's there but  a couple of places, bedroom chairs, gorgeous things, you know!

That's why!
and you  you gotta wa 
Yo 
Yes, I suppose 
You should come in the breaks.

Used to say

That's why .
I think the  some of the we've  turned out isn't so important is it?
Oh no.
You know, you get something that's only twenty five years old
it's not so important to get it perfect.
I say, it's like a 
You know, as the stuff he's  doing because 
Oh yeah!
That's right.
And he's very good!
Very good top quality you see so  he's gotta have it right.
That stuff.
It's handy to know the right way to do it innit?
Yes, I suppose it is.
And I mean the way he did that table
I suppose cos he   
It's nice that table anyway!
That old one's gone, you know.
So I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with that.
It's a nice approach I think.
Mm.

Whereas  Bill 
Bill 
tends to be a bit I don't know  se dictorial 
 
doesn't he?

But they had one in the corner you see and I could see the back leg was gone  said to Margaret an said I might as well do something of that, you know, to do up  it's the only one  that they had there that wanted  really wanted repairing, so the feller said ooh  I don't know he said  hang on, I'll look in the book.
Very, very lucky!
Victorian  walnut.
A hundred and forty.
The state it was in !
Oh that's crazy!
I said oh, I said, I'm very sorry but  I don't kno , don't know what you'd have to charge to justify that  you know, to buy it and then do it up, I don't know!
Yeah.
You'd have to get two hundred and fifty at least, wouldn't you?
So I thought that was a bit greedy so, that's not bad at all that!
That would go for a lot more in  Mold 
Would it?
Oh yes!

When you can get choice of them, if they're going for forty over a piece!
Mm.
Forty five, fifty, something like that.
And all it was, was a tiny thing, like a ruddy camp stool!
And the leg  so he said, well  half a leg was missing.
So I thought well I'm in with a chance, you know, one's  wanted a  and this leg repairing  so  compare it with that  no
