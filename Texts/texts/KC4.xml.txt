Cos in York, or Yorkshire, they have those as starters with gravy.
You just have those in a big bowl of gravy.
Ugh.
Ugh.
We went, when we were staying in York, we went to erm used to go to a pub for our meals didn't we?
Oh yes, that's right.
And erm  I've seen these at ten o'clock at night you know people come in and have a bowl of sort of soup, and, well I suppose it's gravy in there.
And I tried it one night, it was very yummy and very filling.
Oh my god I don't like doing this.
Pardon?
And I don't like this weather.
Neither do I.
It's terrible, isn't it?
Sometimes it's colder indoors than out actually, isn't it?
It's gone on, well it is if the sun's out, and you know if the sun's out.
You want your health in the summer.
Yeah.
I don't remember this  before.
Oh yes they are, I've got all  
Well move up a bit this way Fred if you don't mind.
No, it's alright.
Get round the leg.
I don't know why I've not noticed it before.
Yeah.
It's got four legs on it.
Well, why don't you start helping yourself  
spoons 
Yes.
Oh let me get .
Make some room sonny.
Well who the hell put an empty horseradish pot back in the cupboard?
Do you have ?
John.
Lovely.
There's really no horseradish?
I found three empty jars.
Oh dear.
Well I thought I'd put horseradish on the  whatsit one week.
Yes  fetching a spoon or two 
Do erm,have jobs.
oh you're doing a grand job there.
Oh you've made a mistake here John.
What's that?
You've cooked the carrot.
Not too much I hope.


all soft.
We haven't had roast beef for ages.
No.
Ah.
Silver service, eh?
That's why nobody else is  
anything else.
If you want to get yourself a drink, Alex, do.
Do you want white wine Mum?
This is well, well cooked.
Yes please Anna.
The special touch, you might say .
Are these the ones you put in when we went out?
Yes.
They really ought to have got moved down to the bottom.
I find it's very difficult in these ovens to, you know a normal oven you could sort of put things to the bottom that you've already done .
Yes.
Well you can  
Well you can't these, can you?
you can in mine cos mine's, mine's 
Yes but then you still have heat coming from the  and the top, top and the bottom don't you?
Yes, yes you do.
Then you've got the top's a grill as well so that 
Yes.
you can get two places that are hot, and on top it's absolutely
No, you take that out.
I take my grill out.
Do you?
Yes, if I'm not using the grill I take it out.
It would take a long time to get our grill out because I don't think it would move any more.
Can somebody pass me the new potatoes please?
Hang on I'll move this one.
Oh my god.
Oh god.
Oh dear.
Do you want some red?
Mm.
Thank you very much.
Right?
Pass your granddad some .
fight for that space.
Could you, erm, spear me a roasty 
A roasty, a very roasty, or a medium roasty?
Oh I don't mind.
As they come.
Thank you.
Do you only want one?
Erm  yes.
Did you find another horseradish thing, did you?
Erm a paper top one.
Oh, I give it, is that horseradish?
Oh yes.
Yes, that's in there John.
They're all virtually empty.
I mean
I'll, I'll, I'll have some er
Thank you.
Mum, do you want some of this?
No, I've got mustard thank you John.
I'll have mustard please?
You can have the horseradish.
I want a bit more horseradish 
Oh well, I'll, I'll have a bit of horseradish when I've  mustard off.
Pass the gravy.
John took  
gravy before its 
How many more 
Mum.
Gosh, this beef is tender.
Erm
Cheers.
Cheers everybody.
Cheers John.
The only problem is it's only worth buying if you're buying a reasonable sized piece.
Mm.
Can't really buy a small piece.
Is this the same as a wing rib?
Or is that something different?
Well I'd call it fore rib.
Then you've got little ribs after that.
Start with big.
Do you have it, erm sort of boned?
No.
Not at all?
Well I used to  this was two ribs .
That's what fore rib's the small one.
The other rib, of beef I mean, to get a piece that's worth  cooking cos to carve it and everything else you need at least three ribs and the ribs are sort of usually it's about that sort of size
Mm
and you're talking about a piece at least about eight, seventeen, eighteen pounds.
Who did the gravy?
Mm?
There's so much fat in the gravy.
Lovely.
Yes this beef's come out very well hasn't it?
It's very tender.
Mm.
Yes, very nice.
Delicious.
It's not maybe as rare as you ought to have it but it  really tastes nice.
With disasters and all it's come out reasonably well at the end of the day.
Did it have a disaster?
Yes dad.
Oh.
It's lovely.
Well you've created something rather nice out of your disaster then.
The cornflour packet didn't have much left in it.


The gravy's a disaster.
It's got too much fat in it.
I didn't think it had got enough.
Well I never put salt and pepper in my gravy so 
If you use cornflour 
I use cornflour and two Oxo's.
Do you?
Yeah.
That's what I normally use.
Yeah.
If I'm then doing things, if I'm doing beef gravy I put the beef stock cube, and either one or two Oxo's to 
Oh.
of cornflour.
And then add all the juices from the meat.
But I don't add anything else.
gravy we're having today.
No.
This is totally different.
I never put salt and pepper in my gravy, I never have done.
No.
That's what I like, like about mum's gravy.
But I always add all the juices from the meat.
Out of the meat tin and 
How did you do this gravy then dad?
With difficulty.
No, you've got Bovril, you've got, erm, Oxo's.  some garlic and pepper and some cornflour and then your mother had to lob in some, something else.
Because we'd run out of cornflour and it was all not thick enough.
lob in?
Your use of the English language in front of the microphone is extremely
What are you talking about?
It's lucky I don't talk to a microphone very often.
a microphone over there, dad, and it's turned on.
Oh no.
Nobody'll know who's speaking.
No, well.
But they will now.
So I don't think it matters.
They'll 
they don't know who your dad is.
They do.
They don't.
They know whose household this is.
They don't.
They know this is the  household.
They will now.
They don't.
It's under my name.
They do now.
No, it's under my name.
Yeah, but they do now that it's the  household.
.
Ha.
Can I have some more Yorkshire puddings please, daddy?
Half a one or so I suppose.
Very nice Yorkshires John.
Did you do them?
Well Alex mixed the mix, I put them in the oven and Sue told me get them out or they'll burn.
So it was a sort of a three way erm
Oh I see yeah.
thing really.
They were only burning because you put in what was written on the packet.
Well what's written on the packet is correct unless you have the grill not exactly red hot but about three eighty five.
Twenty five minutes isn't a bad time 
Oh I never cook them for twenty, twenty to twenty five minutes it would be a disaster.
Oh well.
Nor've I.
I was going to say, do you cook Alexander?
Yeah.
You're interested in cooking?
Chinese meal the other day, didn't you?
Yes.
Very  very nice Chinese meal.
What made at home, or
Mm.
Yes, oh yes 
or sent for?
No, he made it.
 

What stir fry and all that stuff?
Mhm.
sauces, soy sauces and things like that.
Mm.
Then what was it?
It was braised prawns  er we had erm lamb, marinated lamb  bits with erm erm garlic and cinnamon as well 
Well garlic and spring onions.
spring onions.
And we had erm  chicken noodles with bamboo shoots.
And mushrooms.
And mushrooms.
Was there anything else?
We didn't do rice.
We were going to do rice but there was  
Stir fry veg.
Yeah, stir fry veg.
What, did you do all this did you?
Well, me and mum.
No,operation.
I did most of the preparation, Mum looked after what was cooking.
.
It's the preparation that takes so long in Chinese cooking.
Mm.
Well there's so many different bits to it isn't there?
That's the trouble.
When I do a Chinese meal
It's just having everything there.
Yeah.
There's so many bits of sauce and 
I spent about two hours measuring out all the different things.
Then I put labels on about every single pot I could find that's got all these various mixes in.
And I've got sort of like  sweet and sour with prawns sort of  er raising mix for something else.
Oh gosh.
That's what I don't like with Chinese, erm, everything's so complicated.
So what you do is
It's part of the cooking.
yeah.
You just  shove everything in a pan.
Do you go out to restaurants for a Chinese meal 
That's what, you know when I did that er  Chinese bolognese thing.
what?
at all?
We used to,.
Do you remember when I did that Chinese bolognese thing?
I made half of that up.
Mm.
But I got the main thing off a,off a TV programme.
But I couldn't get, I didn't get it all down.
So you made up the rest?
So I made up the rest and everyone liked it.
You actually need a bigger kitchen to cook Chinese.
Yeah.
Because you need to set everything out.
Like I did, when I did it I just   
 
put it back  well I put it back , got that, put a bit of that in.
Put a bit of everything in apart from the vegetables which I knew what to put in.
I don't think you'd like me doing that Alex?
You complain as it is about the number of dishes I use.
Mm.
I could imagine if I did Chinese 
I don't use that many dishes when I do Chinese.
I don't .
I just put little drops .
We have the same argument in this household.
Mhm.
You have the what?
Same argument in this household.
Well I can use one bowl, but I don't I use two.
Never use five bowls if one will do.
When it's like pancake mix I tend, or omelettes I tend to use two bowls and even though I only really need to use one.
Well that's silly.
Why do you do that?
 

Where is  then?
 
oh yeah.
Do you want some more white wine mum?
Erm, a wee bit then, thank you.
What time do you have to go back to school Alexander?
Eight.
Seven.


It's eight.
It was six  other days.
Eight.
Where are you going?
Do you mind sitting down till you've erm finished, old chap.
Sorry 
They're all clean in there then.
Yeah, I know.
I'll leave you to it.
 

Shall I make some custard?
O K 
You can.
That pie thing.
And we'll eat bread pudding 
bread pudding .
Do you want warm bread pudding?
I suppose so.
Just because it's not warm it doesn't mean you can't have custard with it.
Well if you 
At school we have cold pudding with custard.
then I'll have to wash a saucepan.
Oh dear, you won't like that Alexander.
It's not very difficult, you've got one that you've done carrots in.
Just have a quick slosh, well hardly even needs a slosh round does it?
 
You don't have to tell them.


It's got, there'll be a carrot flavouring in it.
That's alright.
You hate carrot  cake or whatever it is.
Eh.
Sorry I just ripped all the buttons off me shirt.
You'd better not.
Do you really think I'd rip the buttons of me shirt?
I believe you'd do anything.
Thanks.
Do you want bubbles?
There you go.
Oh, it's nice and sunny out.
Yes.
And as soon as we finish it'll go and get dark again.
Well don't worry dear it won't matter to you what the weather's like for the next week will it?
Yes it will.
Why not?
I've got to do javelin and I don't like going down there in the wet.
When have you got to do javelin?
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
But you've got all your revision to do.
I know.
I also have a games lesson Tuesday and Thursday mum.
I also have an extremely important athletics meeting on Saturday.
Oh dear.
We ought to be coming to see that.

He doesn't know where it is.
They don't go at se with the senior schools.
Mum.

No.
Just one.

Yeah.
Mm.
No, they er  I heard someone say that  though they sort of actively encourage the use of  to go to see many things like sort of sport days, erm .
The main school has a much better sports day though.
They have it after speech day.
So they have half a speech day  
Yes.
They have speech day on the Saturday morning that the ball is on.
How was the ball?
Alright 
Oh yeah.
I forgot about that.
Did you have a good nosh?
It was boring wasn't it?
boring.
Was it boring?
It wasn't boring but it was, just, I mean you know they're sitting five hundred people all at one go and it's 
Boring.
I still can't believe
It wasn't a boring night though.
They get fifteen thousand pounds and they don't make anything from it.
But it wasn't boring to watch though mum.
No idea what .
I've no idea at all.
But I'm sure if they were the organizers  entirely organized.
Mum?
I didn't think it was 
But I'm sure if they could make a profit they would.
I didn't find it boring.
Why did you get  out of it?
No  
Don't make too much custard Alexander, cos I'll .
I just went to Mike and Rob  's house and  my friends.
And we just mucked about until four in the morning.
Say that again?
They just mucked about until four in the morning.
By which time we were all fast asleep in our little beds.
No you weren't!
You came home at four in the morning.
Did not!
I was home here in bed and asleep at half past three.
Yes.
And I can vouch for that.
We didn't get to sleep until about three then.
That was the night I couldn't sleep 
We got to sleep what, about an hour after you went.
Yeah, half past three.
Af after you got, after you got to erm
I know what time you went to sleep because Rob's dad came in, or his mum hammered on the door and said cut it out lads, go to sleep.
No they didn't.
So they stayed overnight then 
Yes, yes.
Oh that must have been when I smacked my nose on my Walkman.
What you stayed here?
stayed at his friends' house.
No, no, no.
He stayed at Bob's house, Rob's.
Cos he lives about a quarter of a mile away from the school.
Ah.
Not that.
He actually  
What's his name?
Rob, Robert.
Good guy isn't he, Alex?
Yeah.
Yes.
That was delicious.
Mm.
Very nice.
Very nice chef.

Oh yes.
Oh yes, yes.
But then, the, Alex thinks there's a whole lot more boys joining, joining the school.
Joining the school?
Yeah.
I wasn't aware there was.
 

What would you do if I set fire to the new, to the shirt?
It does seem a shame to leave  
I'd set fire to you  
 

Who was going to have that?
You have it.
It's too late now I've got .
I wasn't going to have it.
I said 
The next time I see you you'll be saying why did I eat all that
Stop, stop.
ooh, I've got indigestion.
Where are you going with it?
Put in 
Just leave it 


You all know who he takes after don't you?
Mum I've  that thing with a hole in it.
That's your head.
Stop.
see if it's still going round.
Oh yes it is.
What?
It's a thing with a hole in it.
Yes, it needs washing.
Yeah but you don't use .
Don't use that for a creme caramel.
That's what you said you were going to use.
No, no, no.
I thought I had a mould.
With a hole in it.
That, that, that was sort of 
Like  slug.
Yes.
Oh.
Is it good?
I've got a better one.
That thing will always be a  slug now won't it?
Mm.
Who called it the slug?
Alexander.
 

I can't remember ever, have you  the name?
Sort of a er orangy chocolate mousse.
Yes.
But it was only because it was done in er er  I think.
Yes, yes.
What's the chart up on the board?
That's young  chart actually.
But he uses, uses it for everything you know.
Like a diary?
Yeah, like a diary.
It's all in, I mean  the days are down from the top to the bottom.
Mm.
It goes along for twelve months.
Oh right.
And the days go down and I think that there's numbers at the bottom.
I was waiting for somebody to pass the creme caramel out of the fridge.
I can't because  
Wh , Why do you want it?
Oh no I'm not sure.
Yes it is.
Twelve months .
Twelve months, yes, yes.
That's right yes.
And various 
There we are knowing my luck it won't come out.
Do you have to dip it in hot water or something?
Well no it's creme caramel, is that 
creme caramel or proper creme caramel?
You're not supposed to ask those sort of questions dad.
Well.
No.
No it's only because we made some on holiday when we went to
Oh yes, yes.
Switzerland.
Some man, he said oh, he made it all  sort of proper.
Oh I can make it all proper.
Not that you haven't done it 
You know instead of tipping it over which would probably help I'd put that 
put that on top and put the two over together.
Well done.
There.
Now you've got a problem.
Hit it with a spoon.
Not hard enough to break the dish 
Yes I do think you need to  why don't you just try dishing it up out of the thing?
You're never going to get that out.
Yes I am.
All you've got to do is get rid of the air.
Like that.
Ah.
Oh clever dick, oh the clever trousers.
Very good.
Creme caramel and custard.
I've never used that before.


You've had it for a few years too.
Well that's one.
Would everybody like lumpy custard?
You're not supposed to make lumpy custard.
You make very very good custard normally.
No.
Custard with no lumps.
You've made lumpy custard you can eat it.
O K.
I don't know what happened.
lumpy custard.
Oh sorry.
made lumpy custard.
I thought everybody liked it.
I know dad does .
No, I'm just putting some  so if it all ends up thrown away
Oh Sue that is dreadful.
I know.
It won't get thrown away.
That is dreadful.
get thrown away  always ends up getting thrown away.
No it doesn't.
I'll eat it.
It goes in the fridge for about four days.
No it doesn't I jack it out sometimes.
I throw it away straight away these days.
Oh John that is such a terrible waste.
Well what, what are you going to do with it?
It's making too much to start with.
Make cauliflower cheese with that.
Precisely.
I'll make myself some cauliflower cheese tomorrow morning.
Why don't you just cut it all up and put a curry sauce over it?
And have curried vegetables.
Delicious.
I'll have cauliflower cheese tomorrow er lunchtime.
With the cauliflower.
The rest you can fry up in the evening and have it with your cold beef.
 
Exactly.
I did .
It's hard to pour out.
Yeah.
That is dreadful.
I mean they're all usable.
Can somebody pass me a towel please?
Well what happened  
Yes but you see when you get out of here about  seven times between half past six and eight o'clock at night 
Well you ha at least haven't got to do vegetables have you?
I mean they're already done for you.
Just reheat those and you're off and away.
I like to have a lot of vegetables left over.
I can have them fried the next day.
What will we do with it?
Apart from me.
Er..
Well generally there's, there's only three of us here  
There's your custard lad.
Oh lumpy!
It's not.
You said so.
No.
I said does anybody like it.
Oh.
Did I actually say the words does anybody  
You said 
I  I said does anybody like lumpy custard.
That's right.
Does that mean that I've made lumpy custard?
Yes.
Why?
Well because lumpy
Did I actually say I ?
Well no you didn't actually say   but one would presume from that that that's what you were getting.
What you should have said is I hope everybody likes lumpy custard.
Well the trouble with making it in a jar is you don't get much skin do you?
If you put it in a basin then you can sort of 
Yeah but the sk skin's thicker.
Well yeah that's true.
Mm.
custard, oh look lumps.
Very true.
We're deprived these days.
Eh?
Pardon?
.
Cold bread pudding.
Yeah.
It's nice.
Can you eat it hot?
mum's done it in a sweater then it 
Should have slipped it in the erm in the oven.
You nearly said the microwave didn't you?
I nearly said the microwave, but in the oven.
The other thing's behind  next to the erm scales.
Er how did you manage to get two sides of that so perfectly straight?
Well I'll get the cream out.
What that?
Oh yes it was in  thing.
I'll divide it up between three of us.
other erm thing, whatever it is.
Thing?
Oh it's your bread pudding, I see.
Yeah.
I made one yesterday in a meat tin and so Lynn had a lump and I got a lump and you here.

Sorry.
No, no, no, crispy, crunchy.
Who'd like what?
Me please.
I'd like a piece of Gran's thing to start with.
I'll have some of that.
Well that's not fair Alexander is it?
Your mother said who wants what.
Alexander said  and Fred got served first.
Well, I'm sorry.
Oh sorry, yes.
She was trying to get rid of this that's why.
Young people have got to stand up for their rights Alexander.
It's my favourite.
I didn't get the cream.
Oh yeah I'll get the cream.
I mean I read according to the paper this morning young people have got to have a
elders and betters and all that.
That's true.
Young people have got to what?
Stand up to their, have a say.
You've got to listen.
Yeah.
Nobody listens to the young 
Well why not?
Ah 
Ah, since when does nobody listen to you?
At school they don't anyway.
Ah 
Since when did they ever?
I'll have a piece of that please.
What do you mean?
Nobody will want custard 
Nobody wants custard.
You even you're not having custard.
I know but but  eat custard with meringue.
Why not?
It makes the meringue go all weird.
Does anybody want custard?
John do you want this?
No I'll have some of that please.
I'll have some of that too please.
I'll have some of nan's bread pudding I think..
Take that back to school.

They're just trying to prove you
What are you going to have nan?
I'm going to have some cream please.

It's alright.
I'll save the rest of it for you.
Thank you Alec.
out there.
long time.
Must be like that .
No I've come to the conclusion that we're deprived these days.
We don't have any sweets much.
But you're always having sweets.
No.
When people  come but otherwise we're deprived.
Have a banana after .
a banana.
There was me thinking that you always .
Well it depends.
I think  
We had this really nice Danish apple bar that I did last night.
In the where?
A Danish apple bar.
Oh really?
Mm.
Who said this was burnt?
The pastry is a little crispy but 
Very nice.
Yes very nice.
Bottom of the meringue is .
Do you make many jellies?
I haven't had a jelly for ages and I got one from Sainsbury's.
A lemon jelly.
And I actually did it in a plastic basin.
And it has stained it so badly.
And I think well what do they put in this type of thing and it really wasn't that good was it?
The basin or the jelly?
Both.
I, I thought.
I don't know the things you eat with that much colouring in it erm  
 
No, John  
But she's done my  
jelly bowl.
No, it wasn't a proper jelly bowl.
jelly bowl or my jelly bowl .
That's another thing you can't get now is  very much is chocolate blancmange.
We've got some.
Well you can't in Sainsbury's.
Yes we have.
Not chocolate one we've not.
Yes we have we've got some chocolate ones.
Have we?
Yes.
How do you make  then?
That's chocolate and erm, you melt the chocolate and an orange jelly.
Some blinking thing they're, they're needing for a er accents  you know
School custard's really weird.
But we haven't  
You know.
Some research project.
Some sort of weird gross lumpy custard, very nice.
Are you, I mean
the erm
We, we haven't got accents as such have we?
No.
Oh, well we have but it's a London  
I don't think you well  a month now, I mean cotton is a natural .
Yeah that's right but I mean we're just a south east London 
I don't think  
sort of accent.
Well I, I would call it south London.
I would.
Well alright then.
Anyway, call it south London.
It's certainly not a north London accent.
The north London accent is exactly the same I used to live there for years.
Did you?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well I lived in north east London.
Well it depends where you're, where you're going .
in Scotland 
Oh  to Scotland.
Now there are treacle bites.
I'll  home.
What's that treacle thing that we got from you the other day?
That had to be kept in the fridge .
I don't think so.
It was a toffee tart?
Whatever it was.
Why?
I just wondered whether it was
Yes.
What John?
It was in the fridge and the dog.
The fridge and the dog?
Was it that popular?
It was, it was very nice except that Fred had a piece and left the last couple of slices in the tin on the side and the dog took a shine to it so it was in a tin and then in the dog.
you can't blame the dog for that.
Well as far as I'm concerned it was the dog   on the side.
Treacle pie was beautiful.
Was it?
Mm.
Very good.
I don't know why I don't eat it more often.
custard.
Nothing.
custard?
No.
caramel  it was sort of sludge.
Dirty brown sludge.


He used to do that to me at Sunday lunchtime.
He used to sit and say all sorts of terrible things.
eat their dinner.
I mean, he'd put his elbows on the table because we had the kitchen table .


look at your father.
Sue.
I will have a little piece of that lemon pie.
I'll have a very small piece.
That's it.
.
Cos we, at lunchtime we have trays and we have six to a table, we have three up the side and one on the end.
And sometimes it's pretty hard to get the one on the end in because they've, you've got jugs and things, and so you're pushing them all up.
We couldn't get him and he had about this much off.
And he came and he had a massive full plate of rice and curry and then he had custard and gooseberry pie sort of thing.
And he came in and sat down and put his elbows on the edge of his tray and it all went  whack over his blazer and it all slid down onto his trousers.
And I was sitting up, up, say this is the head of the table I was sitting where mum is.
And I saw it and everybody in the whole room saw it and burst out laughing cos it was so funny.
Who was he?
That did it.
Well  just sat down.
What a nice guy.
make a speech.
Mm.
William's on drums.
On drums?
Mm.
Yes.
What he's going to be a drummer?
You don't have to go to Caterham school to become a drummer.
Do you see that  father with long hair and
Yeah.
Guitar.
What is he then?
I should think he's in the group, isn't he?
Who?
Oh no, no, Philip's father, no.
Well perhaps he 
He looks like one of the you know
Who was the man that gave the speech?
Philip .
The one with blond hair.
Yes.
Philip .
Right.
Well now his father
His old man is, has got long blond hair but he's bald on top
That's it, yeah.
and he wears erm sort of grey cowboy boots.
.
Baggy clothes.
And he's got a silver guitar on his lapel
Yeah.
But he's not a musician.
He's a
I always thought he was a jazz 
No he does, he does erm, er oh forgotten what you call it now.
He designs  buildings and windows and things.
An architect.
Well, he's a sort of architect.
A quantity surveyor?
Yeah.
He doesn't design buildings
But he designs windows.
He designs certain bits on buildings like arches, and windows and things like that.
He's got a very nice vehicle.
It's like erm a Range Rover isn't it?
Yeah.
Big.
Great big thing.
Shogun sort of thing.
So we sat there and we decided he was obviously a musician.
He likes music but he's not a musician.
He looks like and I, first of all when we saw him I thought who the hell is that, can't be a father cos look at him, he looks terrible.


 
he looks terrible 
Did he come to the ball?
Did he come to the ball Sue?
should have seen  dad.
Did you see the one who kept running up and down in the weird hat?
Taking photos.
Well that's his, that's his tribal .
Yes, didn't you see him?
Oh what  yes.
Yes.
He, he is a head of them, he head of the tribe.
One of the main tribes of 
They don't call them  they call them tribes or whatever it is .
is French?
Is it?
And he er, well he's probably  French.
You see his dad is basically a king.
A ki king, that's right.
A king, a kingdom, so Richard's really a prince.
Oh.
Doesn't mean that  father of his is a queen does it?
Runs up and down screaming and jumping up and down.
Well when did you see her?
Oh she goes to  matches.
It's an embarrassment.
You sort of creep into a corner and hope she doesn't see you.
really nice.
She's alright to say hello to but then
One of the nicest mums there is.
Yes she is.
Well she's alright.
I think she is too Alex.
You don't actually want to stand next to her though do you?
She is.
When I was playing rugby and I hurt my thumb she actually lent me a very expensive Jaeger coat to keep me warm.
She did and I got mud all over it .
you can't stand any too much she's always on the move.
She's nice.
She comes to all the, all the  football.
Yes, she is, she's very nice but you don't actually want to, if you're on the, the touchline you don't want to stand next to her.
Why?
Well she's jumping up and down, she's screaming and laughing and shouting at people and hollering oh.
That, that's what she goes there for.
I think the worst thing is when their team  at matches.
They were losing and she knew they were going to lose and their last bloke was coming in and she was cheering them on.
She was cheering them on.
Ah we, we, her and I cheered  on who, who, who couldn't score, he never, they never got a score.
Oh was that Trinity?
No, it wasn't Trinity, no.
It was  yeah they'd come quite a long way actually.
Oh yeah, hang on, I can't think who they are but they came all the way .
And we're all going out on the field going come on, very good, we're gonna beat your team, and we got our man and we scored about seven tries in the first three minutes.
Oh not, hardly, not quite.
It's a very rough game Alexander.
Oh Alex's got some  
twenty seconds.
telling you the rules.
Tell daddy what they're changing.
Oh they're going to change the rules that erm, you know there's two scrumhalfs start on their side of the scrum, well they can't come round to the other side.
Cos you know you've got
Yeah.
in the centre of the scrum you've half  and you've got
So as long as you're behind the ball you can keep moving
No.
Well you, that's what you can do at the moment.
Yeah but the new rules for our age group is you have half of the scrum and then you have the scrumhalf and he puts the ball in and he goes back to his side doesn't he?
And the other scrumhalf  and normally the other scrumhalf will come round and tackle him.
Or push him off the ball or something 
Yes.
As long as he stays, stays behind the ball then he's allowed to do that.
Well they're not allowed to, they're not allowed to yeah but they're not allowed to do that any more.
He can't, so he can't come
No.
And he can't, you can't do twist  any more.
Can't you?
No.
The number eight can't pick it up.
Oh.
And erm I can't remember what the other one is.
 
Oh you can't push more than one point four metres or something or other.
Oh my god!
Do you take a tape measure with you?
No but, so if you  
 
 
five minute scrum you can't push over 
You can't push .
That's silly isn't it?
yeah.
The reason is you've got to take  
take out all the extra sort of strain 
All of the extra strain on the  
I suppose the trouble is yeah if you do push, if you do go for that the other side  cos you just sort of push them into the  
What about when you 
Yeah!
in a big mangled heap.
what about when you, what about when you make  
the first row.
Oh as soon as, as soon as you, about over fifteens er is normal rules.
This is all under fifteen.
The good thing about being in the scrum is when you push over and they all collapse and you fall on top of them.
Or you stand there and you walk over them.
Do they get as much pleasure about walking over you?
No cos I normally hit back.
What was this ?
Tighthead prop.
Who?
Tighthead prop.
I think that's  tighthead prop.
Prop forward.
That's what it's called.


I don't know much about rugby.
Better than golf.
four  five days really.
It's better than golf.
Don't you like golf?
No, boring.
Golf?
Yeah.
golf 
Why do you say boring?
I dunno.
Golf is 
Have you actually played it?
Yes.
Lots.
What golf?
Not  I'm not very good at it.
Boring.
Oh I see, as you're no good at it, it's boring.
No, cos it's, you just watch somebody smack a ball as hard as they can with the one wood and see how far it goes.
But you've got an objective, you've got to get it down a hole .
Yeah, put it in a hole.
Well yes I know but  
That's easy!
look at the money they make, golfers.
Yeah look at the money skateboarders make.
Do you know how much, do you know how much the world champion earns in one year?
No.
He will earn something like seven million dollars.
What, for skateboarding?
Yes he does.
You ought to see his house.
This is America is it?
He's got wooden hall, wooden lounge
Doesn't allow any pedestrians.
No pedestrians, no cars.
Erm he's got three videos 
He skateboards all the way from the house  
he's got portable video TV little thing like er like the Sony ones on Virgin.
He's got three TV's, computer  video cameras, everything.
He's got his own skateboard ramp in his back garden and he video tapes what he does so that he can watch what he's doing wrong and all the rest of it.
And he's got  these twenty nine twenty eight 
How ridiculous.
On a skateboard.
Why's it ridiculous?
What's so wonderful about skateboarding?
Well because he's very skilled.
No I accept now that it's, it's extremely skilful.
It's very skilful.
It's just as skilful as most other sports.
Just as skilful as skiing, and, and er ice skating though it's not  phenomenal about  sports 
It's just, you're just thinking that if there's anybody who skateboards just skates and like really ragged clothes because you're not exactly gonna go out wearing a suit skateboarding cos as soon as you fall off you you're gonna rip it to shreds aren't you?
True.
I cannot see  skateboarding being sports.
It's in the next Olympics.
Oh yeah.
they do it on these er  they must be  you know 
It's gonna be in the next Olympics.
For speed, skating, slalom and round.
And street style.
Are all gonna be in the next Olympics.
As much a sport as you could call erm 
Well I dare say but it's far more dignified to play golf .
Oh what do you, you know erm  that sort of thing.
Why's it far more dignified?
They're just stuck up normally.
No they're not.
Load of stuck up
To play golf erm  it's really quite  
Have I got to play golf?
Well golf is, is hardly a sport, it's not in the, it's not like it's in the Olympics is it?
No.
No, it's a sport, but I mean it's erm  Well to most people it's a pastime isn't it?
Yeah.
Pastime for ordinary golfers.
What there's Nick Faldo, makes a lot of money at it anyway.
Oh well, it's a sport for him, yes.
But I say for most  ordinary people who play it, it's a pastime.
It's not easy hitting that little ball you know.
Yes it is.
It is not.
It is.
It is not.
It is.
It is not.
It is, it is.
I can even slice it and I've only played golf once.
Oh I don't know.
If you've got, if you've got 
 
a good eye there's nothing hard in hitting the ball.
It's if it goes where you want it to that's hard.
Precisely.
Precisely.
Well that applies to any, any sport, any kind of sport.
Apart from cricket where you just smack it as hard as you can.
I, I, I think there's an art to that as well.
Yeah there is.
I can play it, sort of.
I dunno, cricket, cricket
I can bowl, I'm quite a bowler.
cricket is 
I'm extremely fast armed.
Not very accurate.
Well I, I can't, I don't bowl them out I have to bowl them about that far away from the wickets .
So I get, if I get them on target I normally get a couple of wickets.
Mm.
Cos I'm really fast.
Or I get an L B.
Well he is at javelin, and what was the other thing he was throwing, the discus?
Discus.
No.
It's shot.
No, no, no the shot.
I don't like shot.
Oh the shot .
Are you still doing that?
No.
Putting the shot.
You were good.
No.
Didn't you come second in that?
Yeah but I was just got out of it, not very good at it.
Now I can't see any sense in throwing  whatsit, the javelin.
Now honestly
We were just saying you ought to be good at that.
Well I am.
spear broke, you throw it at the ground.
You don't you throw it at animals to kill them.
Yeah but basically downwards all the time.
Why can't you see the point in throwing a javelin?
No I can't see much sport in that.
I can't see you do it this year.
Why not?
Well I think it's a lot, there's a lot of 
What is it that, you know, it doesn't achieve anything does it?
Well of course it does.
It, it achieves just as much as softly doing hop skip and a jump.
What's the difference?
It, it achieves the same as somebody, somebody putting a ball in a hole with, with as least hits as he can.
It achieves, it achieves as much as some, as somebody throwing a hammer.
Or a shot.
Oh yeah.
Or jumping, jumping over an eight foot fence.
Yes.
Well they're not, erm   are they?
Can't tell the difference.
I know, they're all the same.
You wrap all those, all that lot up in one sort of, you know .
Well I think it's very interesting.
It it it it takes a lot of doing.
Yeah it does.
It's got a lot of skill in it actually.
There's a lot of skill in it.
There's a lot of skill in javelin throwing.
It is.
There's more skill in that than there is the discus.
There is.
Discus 
Might just as well 
make a good  as well.
Yes.
There's a lot of skill in discus sonny, don't you forget it.
Oh yeah there is actually.
Oh shot put's probably the easiest to do.
Shot put is more, is more
Brute force.
Brute force.
Whereas javelin is a lot of skill 
I mean the hammer, the hammer is  
Surely javelin is brute force as well?
Yeah but it's got to spill and spin right.
It isn't brute, isn't javelin the same, it's brute force.
No.
Because however, however much brute force you put in, it's how you put through the javelin.
It's how you put it through 
If you  it as far as far as you can you've got to, when you throw javelin you've got to bring your arm through right, you've got to twist, you've got to make sure your wrist's tight  you've got to keep your erm left foot planted.
You've got to, oh you've just to keep it straight.
It's very hard.
Very, very .
Alright then, alright then.
You see you don't just, you don't just go  like this 
technique in in playing golf.
Yeah, there is a technique.
That's alright then.
Golf  technique extremely easy.
Yes but surely Alexander you're, you're only saying that er  you don't er, the more you  golf.
Yeah I know but.
I know that's all I said.
I mean, the, you don't get many  You do get youngsters as young as you they do, they do, by, by the time 
Yeah but it's no .
Well they start, it it's the same way that er very young people er start playing snooker don't they?
Well I play snooker.
Time they get to about sixteen or seventeen you know they can be up in the top players.
You certainly make money if you begin .
Young people play bowls these days too.
They don't make much money at it though .
No, no.
Bowls is a sport that they don't make much money.
money I think it's the sport that counts.
I know but I mean  
Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose , it's how you play the game.
Oh dear.
They make a few quid don't they at bowls?
Well they do  cheat or not.
No  
guys at the top  what is it Tony Al Tony Alcock.
Tony Alcock.
But they don't win .
Oh you cruel thing.
Cruel?
. It's a very rough sport.
What is?
I know it is.
Rugby.
I don't know why you play it.
Cos I like hitting people.
I like hitting my balls ugh.
streak in you.
Yeah well I take after my mum.
Do you.
Do you have er young boys at your school?
Do they have to do all your bidding and fetching and carrying and things?
No.
They used to but they don't any more they've taken all that sort of brilliant stuff away.
But they did that to me when I was their age and now as soon as I get to fourteen when when you can, when you can, when you could do that  And now today  it's not fair.
Mm.
.
.
No it's probably  right that you don't bully the youngsters.
Well, they did it to me.
Yes, but you didn't like it did you?
.
N n .
But they did it to everybody, it happened to everybody.
.
Except when you get there and they stop it.
Yeah we're not even allowed to report them any more.
Put them on the landing.
No because it's just oh no you'll get them all cold.
Where you ever put on the landing?
Mhm.
Often.
What for?
Hitting people normally.
Hitting people?
Yeah with my pillows.
We had pillow fights.
Bed slipper fights.
Well you weren't the only one out on the landing then?
No everybody was.
There was probably more of you on the landing than there was 
There wasn't.
But one night we tried to get the whole entire floor out on the landing.
Well some of us swapped and the Gammas didn't want to do it.
All the Alpha Betas and most of the Gammas were out on the landing and they ran out of room.
And so they started putting people downstairs  everywhere and shoving them in corners that nobody even .
Are you sorry that your Mr  's leaving?
No.
Well I am a little bit.
Oh.
Was he nice to you, all you boys?
Well he,, well, you know but just because he's leaving he he seems to think that he's got to upturn the, upturn the, upturn the term.
And everything has gone to pot.
I'm very surprised at that.
Everything thing's gone all weird and nobody knows what's happening.
They've changed all the things that used to be just because they know  Like form twos always used to have an end of term leaving party.
But now they're not just so all the people can have one because Mr and Mrs  are leaving.
Oh well.
It was the form twos, the only thing that I, that they had to, they had to look forward to in the whole time they were there.
And I've been there since Alpha and I every year I've looked out and watched the form twos.
And now suddenly just as soon as I come to form twos they've taken that away.
What you're in form two now?
Yeah.
They've taken all the privileges away.
Ah.
Is it only a temporary?
No.
We don't know.
We don't have any  teachers  for about eighteen months.
He does look like one.
Have you seen him?
No.
Has he got a long brown habit on?
No but he's got hair like one.
He looks
Yeah but you won't be in, you  Alexander, will it?
 
I know it's good.
No.
After, after er you break up in the summer?
Yeah I know that's good.
So next year form two can have their party?
Ask if you can join them.
No.
Wouldn't want to mix with that bunch anyway.
But you are one of them now.
What, one of the form ones?
Yeah I thought you were a form two?
Yeah but
Well what are the form ones like?
Oh I see form ones will be form two next year.
Right.
load of rabble.
Well, they're the same as you were last year aren't they?
Well yeah I know.
But that's how the form twos thought of us last year as well   load of rabble.
Yes.
That one year can make such a difference can't it?
school he'll be .
Oh you're gonna be the rabble again, aren't you?
I know, cool.
I like being the rabble cos you never have any responsibilities.
If you're form two they always look to you to, I mean we can't do our thing by ourselves but soon as something needs done, doing they look to us.
Well there you are you're the responsible lot aren't you?
I know but we can't do, we can't do anything apart from be told what to do by the teachers.
We can't tell people what to do.
Well that's right.
You shouldn't have to.
We're not allowed to wreak punishment apart from when our floor
That I believe is right too, why should you?
Why, because we were at, in Alpha and Beta and Gamma and form one we were always admitted punishment by form twos.
Whatever they felt like they sort of 
They've never had people like  barks or tells .
No they're called 
alright isn't he?
Yeah I know but he admitted a lot of punishments.
Did he?
Yes.
I don't think your mum would like you sticking that .
I was gonna say if you keep doing that you'll be getting some .
Would you like to say .
Yes.
Present from mummy.
dishwasher.
Oh shall we go and sit in the other room while daddy finishes the washing up?
Oh it's not fair that he did some 
did all the serious bits.
You made the gravy.
Well the rest .
He didn't touch any of the rest of it.
What's up with your dishwasher?
It is, it is but what's there is just saucepans and things.
Well, come on we'll go and sit in the other room.
These cups have lasted  they're three years older than you are.
Where are you sitting, in here Alexander?
Oh well you are aren't you?
fire on.
You are aren't you?
Yeah I know.
You're sitting in here.
I know.
Yeah I know this fire's on.
Hello Mr thingy.
You're bugged, you're bugged.
Hello.
I'm not bugged.
You are.
I'm not.
I'm not bugged.
Nothing bugs me, by anything at all, anything bugging me.
I can't, I'm not annoyed by anything, right?
Oh no alright well.
I'm not being bugged.
I'm not using bugged in that er, bugging in conversations.
Oh.
Oh.
Are you going that  rugby tour,on the edge of somewhere?
Yeah.
Well it's not a tour, it's a, like lessons.
Oh.
Where is that then?
It's a rugby school in Stow.
In where?
Stow.
Oh at Stow School?
Yeah.
Oh.
They do cricket there as well.
My mate John hasn't heard anything from them yet.
How many of you going?
Five.
Where you picked to go or
No.
No no they had to play.
No no just something that some of us wanted to do.
It's nothing to do with the school.
Nothing to do with school.
Oh I see.
No no it just  Rob's .
Yeah.
And so is Richard .
That will be interesting isn't it?
Yeah.
got, got fair old rugby players interested I think.
Mm.
won the grand slam .
Oh .
Well does he run it then?
Well.
He goes there
so he gives you advice that sort of thing?
Well I think that he's got some educational interest.
There's one or two other old you know erm .
I think probably he organizes .
Coaching school and
Oh yes.
they, they don't play much.
No.
.
Well I don't know what  does for a living or  does for a living.
was injured .
Mm.
before they had the goals.
Oh I don't know, I
I don't follow rugby to that extent.
No.
That school like, Alexander goes to I mean it's a good place to go to isn't it?
If you can afford to send your kids there.
I would say there was more going on, going for them isn't there than
Oh yes, yes.
than the old comprehensive schools.
Some are better than others of course but er
I think that a big advantage if you wanting to get in very large areas like London and Birmingham.
I think that if the schools, I don't suppose that  kind of thing but erm, I mean the schools out in Surrey and all erm places like that.
When you get down there  they're much  much better than
Oh yes.
I mean we have a local school, Hayes School which is a very good comprehensive
Mm.
All the comprehensives.
and everybody
But I don't think parts of Croydon, south of Croydon, Birmingham  they're much better down there.
I mean people move in to Hayes specially so that their kids can go there.
Yes.
I think generally speaking you erm schools out in the country are better.
Oh yes.
Mm
Cos then you 
It's O K if your headmasters that run the school change I mean schools tend to change with headmasters don't they?
Cos it'd be, I mean a big disadvantage to a lot of particular schools around this area is the number of erm Asian and
Yes.
erm Indian.
I mean, they, they probably don't speak English and they're at at a disadvantage to start off with.
Yes.
Which again is holding the others back.
Yes, yes.
changing headmasters at his school and they had a terrible reputation one time.
Did it?
 
Sorry.
your black rucksack?
My black 
The one that was in, in the other room?
Yeah.
Well I put it in the hall
Yeah.
behind the hall stand but mummy must have shifted it cos, shifted it with that er that bag of hers so I should ask mummy where it is.
Cos it was, I put it behind the hall stand.
O K.
But they had a new headmaster oh he's just retired, he's been there  been there since Lynn was there when  since she was  since the er she's twice that age so I mean he must have been there eighteen years but when he went there he's er totally  the school from the word go 
No, I got, I need to get some stuff out of the red one.
and it changed out of all recognition.
Now it's one of the, the best schools  for miles around.
Is he er  is he due to retire or
Ye yes he's just retired.
He has just retired?
There's been a new headmaster for the last year I think so I don't know what he  
Bath now  
What did you say?
Well you might find as he's got a good, good disciplined school he'll  Unless of course he's of the opposite  
Well yes

Yes she told me.
Gonna cost about sixteen quid to have it repaired.

Blimey.
It's had to go away to the makers.
Oh.
I don't know what's wrong with it I'm sure.
without a watch in this bloody thing.
Yeah.
Keeps stopping.
Does it?
Oh dear.
Oh this is the one I had years ago this one, I've never used it.
Oh.
It's donkey's years  Is young Ben sailing this weekend or is he
Eh, yes, oh he goes every Saturday.
Eh, Saturday does he ?
Yeah, yeah.
Where does he go to?
On the erm  well, down the Mer the Medway.
Medway?
Behind the it's not the Medway .
Chatham way.
It's a, yes, Chatham way.
It's a river that runs off the Medway.
Stewer?
No it's not Stewer.
Isn't it?
Oh.
Oh, it comes up from Canterbury of course.
No, I, I can't remember the name of it 
What is, what sort of a boat have they got, is it
Oh, about a twenty six footer, something like that.
sailing boat?
Oh it's a sailing boat, yeah, yeah.
I've never seen it.
What are you doing for your holidays this year, any ?
I don't really yet.
I was thinking of going.
Hm.
I was thinking of going to Austria about the end of September October but, if Alexander's not going abroad I don't know, I shall have to  change me mind probably, I'll have to have a word with Sue.
what's Sue doing with her holidays this year?
There not.
Aren't they?.
Well I think there in, well they can't go together, told you the last time you was here, they can't go on holiday together.
Oh somebody got to business oh.
They can't leave the business .
They had more staff last year they could leave in.
pardon.
They had staff they could leave in charge last year.
Haven't they got anybody now?
Well they've only got one, one girl who sort of does clerical and stuff and reception, they haven't got a anybody who knows how to  .
of there's.
Yeah, yeah, they haven't got anybody who knows anything about the business, well not enough about it.
really expensive are now, aren't they?
Yeah 
I suppose  got a car.
You know, moaning about these blokes like the postman going on strike over a seven per cent rise.
Oh I.
I mean, they shouldn't want more than seven per cent because the cost of living, you know, the inflation's gone down, but then when a bloke gets forty five thousand quid, you know eh, on a firm where they've a, they've made a profit, but he got an increase of forty five thousand pound which was of, no, no about forty per cent rather, forty per cent increase in his salary, I mean it's bloody, I mean, how can, how can they expect, you know, the ordinary working man to put up with bloody awful increase, if, if they go and give bosses increases like that, I mean it doesn't make sense.
Yes, but it's only, it's only people that are in these higher executive jobs that get these bloody monies.
Yeah, but then they shouldn't get it, they shouldn't do it.
I know.
I mean as I say now, how can you turn round to a  to a bloke who's, well doesn't matter what his on, eh, what, what ever his, his rate of pay is, how can you turn round to him and say you can't have more than seven per cent, and his got, his got something like a about twenty five, thirty per cent .
I think, I think your find that a lot of these big, big money people get paid according to results, and if they get good results they get good money.
Yeah, but I don't think this bloke could have particularly good I don't think this bloke had particularly good results.
And if the results  results fall then they loose it .
Hm.
He hadn't had good results.
Well as that, from my experience, they only pay ya for what your worth, not what , don't pay ya because your good looking or anything like that 
If a firm's not doing well they can't pay ya, can it?
Well .
That's, our, our Nick's people would, wouldn't it, and that was it.
Hm.
They lost all the bloody trade.
Hm.
I, even Nick, Nick said two years ago things started going down hill  The best paid jobs these days, say what you like,don't like, is either in local government or something like that.
There over paid vastly, local government.
Hm.
Well I don't really know how much they get.
Pardon.
I don't really know how much money they get.
Well you've only got to look at adverts in the ruddy paper for
I mean  I no, I'm, I'm thinking more on the ordinary clerical and that executive stuff, not the  jobs .
Oh well, I was flicking the .
Yeah, yeah.
.
I mean I don't think there particularly well paid, but they, there well paid for what they flipping well do cos they don't, they, they, they'll do it, but I mean eh, that's the fault of the bosses, they should cut down there staff.
You can't blame, you can't blame people for hanging about doing nothing if they've twice as many staff as they should've, and there paying them, I mean, that, that's an administrative error, not a  well it seems to be very rift in local government that there over staffed 
I, I think all these, all these people in local government and things, and eh, it was obvious when, you see adverts for jobs, what a bloody salaries there paying them, for a mediocre job.
Well I never look at the adverts do I?
I'm not in .
No, I don't suppose you do now, but, but I have would off worked for local authorities, because at one time they were very poorly paid.
But it's all changed now, there the best paid people in the ruddy country.
Hm 
There'll have to have a ruddy cut down , over this staff over this community charge, there've been trouble here next.
Hm.
Think about the money, about a quarter of the staff that they did have.
Hm, there see, they are over staffed, there's no doubt about it, aren't they?
.
But I mean I say, that's not the fault of the people who work there, there not going to put themselves out of work.
They should never have been taken on in the first place, any bet, that our, our problem should never have been taken on in the first place .
Well that's it , this is it, they, they take on staff to increase there own importance.
This is Alexander's first day back at school is it?
Yes.
Today?
Well it's only half  it was only half term  had wasn't it?
I don't know.
Yes, it's only half term.
I mean now
And now he has to stay to July, does he?
Yes.
And then he's gonna start travelling daily eh?
It'll be a long day for him won't it?
Mm.
Oh well, we knew that when he was
Pardon?
We knew that when he went, went there, that's why he went boarding.
Mm.
Oh though, it's not bad travelling down there is it?
Oh travelling's not bad, I mean,it's only a local train and eh, and it's going, he'll be going in the wrong dir the best direction each time, instead of travelling up to town he'll be travelling out.
He'll be going the other way.
Going the other way, so eh, be no problem.
Oh there's no problem as far as that's concerned.
Well you got nearly a mile to walk when he gets to the station.
He's got nearly a mile to walk?
Yeah.
Ain't there any buses?
It's not quite as far to the main school, cos the main school goes first and the prep school far, no there's no  up that road, it doesn't go anywhere only to the school.
Pardon?
Doesn't go anywhere only to the school and the eh  and the Downs,well,round, but I think there's , no villages  I don't think Dale and
Mm.
Well I mean,, school doesn't lay on buses or anything from the station  Think they do have buses come up from places like Bletchingly and erm, Godstone.
From where?
Bletchingly.
Bletchingly.
Bletchingly, yes, it's on the, just below the North Downs.
Oh.
Villages along the eh
Buses coming along that way?
Well er yes I think, cos they get a lot of pupils from there
Oh do they?
and the buses, you know, the special buses run, no, the school doesn't run them.
No.
But because there's a demand for it, the buses run to the school and pick them up at the school.
How old is he now, fourteen?
He'll be fourteen in October.
Like the same as Tom, he's
Mm.
He's fourteen in July I think,what's a name gave me the dates and I never ruddy well look at them.
Oh well it ain't July yet.
Aye, she gave me Amy's about the day before, I thought I look at it now, so, I only just got it in time.
Erm
No, she's got it here, where's Tom?
Second of August Tom's is.
Second of August?
Aye, and Amy was the sixteenth of May, Zelda is the third of September and Nick is the twenty second of July.
Alexander is the eh, eleventh of October.
Eleventh of the tenth.
Nick's  is very eh, expensive in Holland it's cost him a lot of money.
Mm, has he?
Oh dear, mm 
Good job he had his mum's money, because otherwise that'll be .
Yeah  What's his salary like there then?
I don't know , I've never asked them that.
I think it's pretty good.
Mm.
They wouldn't of gone in the first place.
No.
But you see you  the  of Nick is, you see, he worked on his own for this twelve months.
Mm.
Well more than that.
Mm.
And people weren't paying him.
Oh yeah, this is it.
And he's still, one bloke went bankrupt, and he only got  amount off him, he's telling me the other week, he's, he's still five thousand pounds owing to him, though, work he did twelve months ago 
Course it is yeah.
Ah, it's hopeless isn't it?
Well there's only one way to deal with them , pay you on a monthly basis, or stop working for them.
Oh yes, yeah 
But when he went to Holland, his bill was twelve thousand pounds owing to him,.
Was it?
Are they bringing the horses back?
Oh I, I, I just, I don't,not to get rid of them bloody horses, alright I know what horses cost.
Well they are damned expensive.
Well of course they are and bringing them over here must cost them  five hundred quid.
Yeah, it must've cost him that to take them over there.
Sell them to the knackers yard.
Wouldn't get much for them there.
Eh?
Wouldn't get much for them there.
Aye, but you haven't got to pay out have you?
Oh no, no.
What the hell does it matter, why pay about five hundred pounds and, and that's two horses I've got, that's a thousand pounds.
Yeah.
Well they've got to go into quarantine, and that'll cost them won't he?
Don't have to go in quarantine horses don't.
Don't they, oh.
Apparently not, I didn't know what .
Oh no , probably not, they don't, they eh, they don't get foot and mouth disease.
No.
They've got, they've, they've got, they haven't got the 
But you see 
hooves, their hooves are not .
Charlie , is on his last legs, has been for years and, might as well have him put down,as that Nick keep saying, I think I'll have to have him put down he, when he takes him for a walk he collapses.
.
Well, have him put down over there 
But they have to pay for the schooling over there, you know.
Yes, I .
I don't think Nick realised any of this when he went there, I don't think he looked into it enough.
No.
Don't eh, do the, do the Dutch people have to pay for the schooling?
The children's schooling?
I don't know whether it's only a  English.
Could be that.
Mm.
I know, I don't know, I've no idea.
They don't pay anything here do they?
No, no, no, no charge for schools here at all.
Well you see they're always talking about what we don't get in this country, they don't tell you what they don't bloody get abroad.
Yes .
I don't know what their income tax is like is,.
Well I've got no idea.
I mean, I, I just know nothing about it, I know nothing about it at all.
I mean the only country I spent a lot of time in, in, in Europe is Austria, and then I only stopped in remote villages, you know, more or less, so er, I mean they rely on eh, tourist trade, they rely on tourist trade, where, where I've
Eh?
They rely on tourist trade.
Oh yes.
In Austria , they don't absolute in the , I mean I know nothing about their industrial places at all.
I don't know their industrial
I don't, I don't go to the towns or
Holland, can to see , look to me as if there were plenty of it when I was there.
Oh I  plenty of industry at the moment, yeah.
But I mean what the pay relative to us the cost of living and everything else, I don't know.
I don't think the cost of living is any cheaper than it is here, from what I can gather.
Mm, well the cost of living is certainly no cheaper in Austria than it is here.
I mean, I don't know what sort of taxes they have on eh, on drink and that sort of thing, but I think Austria is more or less the same same sort of tax.
I don't know whether they have to pay income tax or what they have to do.
Oh they're bound, I think they're, well, I don't know whether they thought
It's only  not going to stay, she's coming back.
They have all sorts of local taxes and that, you know.
Do they?
Yes.
The, well that's if in place of their age, but their local taxes they, they collect from everybody, you go into a restaurant
Oh yes I notice .
I'm, I'm not talking about VAT now, I'm talking about local tax.
No, no , yeah.
So everybody who, who uses the services at a place, pays for it, you know.
Don't know if you get it on hotel bills, I think they have to pay something, yes.
On hotel bills, they don't, but usually they put it, including local tax, or something like, they always use to show it separately at one time, it's a percentage, but now, very often your bill just shows it as a, including local tax.
Aye.
But, oh I don't know.
They're always knocking the government in this country, it's not much  the government are, are they?
Somebody's knocking them, whatever, ha, whatever  says.
I should've got a day return, it wouldn't, it'll been cheaper.
I did, but, how much for a single, two pound sixty and return two pound seventy.
Yeah, ten pence difference.
.
What, a day return you see, is usually cheaper than a single, well it use to be.
Yeah, I think it might be now.
You see, he  pay the proper fare, if you only have a single.
Yeah.
Pay the normal fare.
Make mad passionate love to me Jan, eh?
No, bloody hell.
Perhaps .
that's .
, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.
I don't know whether I could manage to make mad passionate love to anybody now.

Oh I mustn't lose that, my grandson bought me that in Greece  Cos I'm a pipe smoker and er, but it's not a Zippo, and he got it very cheap English you see, but I've knackered him you see, because I, he thinks I've still got that, but I, I, I bought a Zippo one, and it's, it's the hippo, the Zippo one that's in there  the other one was fucking useless, well, it lasted for a couple of months, a few months, but er
How's your dad and mum?
Alright, mother's alright, she's on top of the world she is at the moment, nothing of her, but, she seems to be struggling through it all.
I passed your dad on the crossing the other day.

He never has done, he's always fucking  and fucking .
Oh yeah, no, I , no, you know his feet went up  ah well, I don't know.
No, he ain't for years now.
You know what they say 
I mean for a it's a habit, why he walks like that because he's come home from the Duke so many times  pissed innit?
Oh he wasn't coming home from the Duke Dave he was going towards it.
No, he's just got into a habit, you know.


It's no , when he used to come here, he used to be fourteen stone odd.
Did he?
It was only about eleven now, something like that, but he used to be fourteen stone.
He's got to be over eleven, I'm eleven, bloody .
Well, got to be about twelve then.
Yeah.
He was fourteen plus I think at one time.
The heaviest I've ever been in me life is thirteen stone.
He's never had an ounce, he's never had an outdoor activity in his life, he's never done anything.
And it was no bloody good to me.
Mhm.
Never done, any, any manual work, up, up until when he started packing in the shoes a few years ago.
Well I would've called what I did in bloody Austria eighteen months ago physical  it knackered me more than many other bloody things I did, like crawling up bloody hills and   Mind you it's just as enjoyable.
Do you still go oh, oh, oh, oh when you're seventy seven do you Fred?
Oh yes,, I don't know, I don't know whether women do, I haven't had a seventy seven year old women yet.
I don't know that I've got any ambitions that way  although you never know, do you now, what they say there's many a good tune played on an old fiddle  I thought you was going to say old women don't, older women don't appeal to me, but what about the one who raped me when I was thirteen?
No, I, she  she hit me , I enjoyed every minute of it  it was a make of the ,eh?
in the family .
Oh yes, keep it in the family   oh dear  she was my youngest sister too and she's been dead for, oh bloody hell, she was eighty six when she died, how long's that ago, a few years, I'm the baby of the family  and me brother's the next one, and he's eight eighty five now, is he?
No he's eighty four, he's eighty four, he's five younger, five years older than me  
And his wife died a year ago nearly?
Eh?
My brother's wife died a year ago nearly, and I've seen two off  When you were, have you seen Marion at all?
Cunt, fuck her, mate.
No.
Well you did, didn't you?
Yes.
That's all right then  I think I might almost manage it with Marion.
Just forget her.


I'd sooner just forget her.
Oh alright, I'm sor I'm sorry David.
No, no, no, no apologies I just don't want to know   I'll never forget her, but I'll never wanna fucking see her again, I can guarantee you that.

I should've learnt everything by the time I was thirty, not wait until I was in me forties.
Well that's true, yes, yes, David, yes  I don't think we should be talking like this you know.
Eh?
I don't think we should be talking like this but it's quite natural isn't it?
I've had more fun since I've been forty, sexually than what I have all fucking .
I've always had fun sexually.
Eh?

In fact I'm a very lucky man, you know, I can  love them and leave them  all except one, all except one, you've al you've always, you've always got to meet your Waterloo haven't you eh?
 

Mind you I didn't say that I, I, I, I was faithful to that one, but I couldn't leave it  because she needed me so much.
Yeah, you see, now so much got in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us,, speak ill of the rest of us  Ha    I've just finished reading the er, whole text of Rudyard Kipling's .
Yeah.
Yeah.
You want ?
I knew er lots on beat and pic bits and pieces out of them but er, bloody amazing how many, how many he wrote in his life time.

A few places there  size of house .
No, no, no, no, no , oh a lot of size of house at Hereford.
Hereford's got a lot of size of houses, but no, no but, it was very clear, absolutely clear, I mean our scrumpy shouldn't be clear.
No, it should be all thick and horrible.
Yeah  I don't .
Well, what, what it doesn't taste of scrumpy, but it was absolutely clear, no it was  quite a nice drink, but erm, but it wasn't scrumpy.
Scrumpy should come up, scrumpy should come up all clouded you know, you know with bits of sheep and er  bit bits of sheep and rats and that lying about in it  were they've thrown them into the   you think I'm joking don't you?
I use to drink scrumpy you know, you know, I, I mean, I must be going back before your time, you know, a long time, you know, we're talking about drinking scrumpy in the thirties  and forty and fifties, when scrumpy was scrumpy  and when we were glad of it   Oh, I use to love the old scrumpy.
It was so dry, now,you know the scrumpy you get here, I mean, that, that, scrumpy jack is nothing like it, but the first time you drink real scrumpy in Somerset or Devon you know, or, or, or around there, and we go  and your mouth goes  
That it, it's true, it's absolutely, but when you managed to swallow a few bot you know, a few of them, you know, you know it's alright then.
Well it is so dry, god, but er,the first time I drank it, I think it was about threepence a pint, it was always a lot cheaper than beer, you know, it was in the thirties, threepence a pint.
