10 ways to enjoy a superb self catering holiday
Dear Visitor,
Over 100,000 visitors enjoy a John Fowler Holiday each year.
It's a great pleasure to me and a certain indication of satisfaction that many of them are regulars.
Since I welcomed my first visitor in 1953 my policy of giving value for money has never changed.
My firm belief in offering pleasant accommodation at sensible prices together with plenty of FREE amenities has attracted an ever-increasing number of satisfied customers.
Have a good look at what we offer, study our prices and you'll see why so many holidaymakers choose a John Fowler Holiday year after year.
Devon & Cornwall are justifiably the most popular holiday areas in Britain and we offer you a choice of 10 different holidays, all easy to reach as our map shows.
If you are looking for a bargain check our early and late holidays for specially low rates.
Remember the West Country is particularly beautiful in Spring and Autumn and there are no crowds.
All of us at John Fowler Holidays will be pleased to see you at any time and hope to have the pleasure of giving you a good holiday.
Remember a warm welcome awaits you.
