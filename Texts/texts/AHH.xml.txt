Letter to the Editor: Gay sex is subversive
SIR Ian McKellen (Letters, March 29) must not be allowed to get away with his blanket assertion that equality for homosexuals has been established throughout Europe.
One has to distinguish between the individual and the practice.
Europeans recognise that some individuals are by nature homosexual; as individuals, they must be respected and their rights must be protected.
But let us not be led astray: the practice of homosexuality is anathema to all Christian people and not just in Europe.
It can only subvert the young.
