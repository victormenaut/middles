The more the government does, the less you're free to do
Over the last ten years, the Government has removed many of the freedoms we take for granted.
While it talks about rolling back the state, it has overseen a major increase in central government and police power.
It has curtailed our right to peaceful assembly, to join a trade union, to elect our own local government, to receive information, to be free from discrimination.
When these rights are taken from some, the freedom of all is threatened.
The National Council for Civil Liberties is a non-partisan, voluntary organisation which has campaigned effectively to defend this country's freedom for over 50 years.
We are now facing the most serious challenge in our history and depend on you for support.
Please act now.
While there's still something you can do.
