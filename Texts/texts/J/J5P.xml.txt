STANLEY TEE & CO.
Dear Miss,
Thank you for your letter of the 5th instant enclosing a photocopy of the Bank's offer of an endowment mortgage of £49,400.
You will appreciate that before Contracts can be exchanged I must have the insurance company's acceptance of your life proposals showing that your ages have been admitted and when you visit the Bank on Friday no doubt you will impress upon them that you are under pressure to exchange Contracts for your purchase and ask them to expedite the issue of the life acceptance as soon as possible.
You should take with you to the Bank your birth certificates and I suggest that you take some photocopies so that the Bank can forward these to the insurance company with your proposal form so that your ages can be admitted without further delay.
Bishop's Stortford
In the meantime I have returned the draft Contract approved to the vendor's solicitors providing for a reduced deposit of £2,600 instead of the full 10% deposit of £5,200 and I enclose one part of the Contract for signature by you both where indicated in pencil.
Mr. should ensure that all of his initials are included in his signature.
The Title to the property is registered at H.M. Land Registry and is sold with the benefit of the rights granted by, but subject to the exceptions and reservations in respect of the adjoining properties which are referred to in the Property Register of the Title, a copy of which enclose.
I also enclose a copy of the vendor's solicitors replies to my Preliminary Enquiries for your information and retention and I would draw your attention to their replies to Enquiries 4,10(A) and (B), 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 27, 28 and 31.
I also enclose a copy of a letter raising observations on their replies to my Enquiries and I await hearing from them on these points.
You will note that my Local Search reveals a repair grant of £704.48 registered on 3rd January 1984 but the period of three years requiring payment have now lapsed.
When returning the draft Contract to me duly signed will you let me have a cheque in favour of Messrs. Stanley Tee & Co. for £2,600 the 5% deposit and I will place this on deposit with my firm's bankers so that it does not lose you interest, so there should be no delay in exchanging contracts once you have received the insurance company's acceptance of your life proposals.
I enclose a Statement showing the approximate sums involved in connection with your purchase but you will appreciate that these to do not take into account any apportionment of general and water rates.
My Search reveals that the property is within a conservation area and this means that if there are any trees growing on the property they have the same protection as trees the subject of a Tree Preservation Order.
In reply to the enquiry asking if there was any order, draft order or scheme for the construction of a new trunk road or special road or any proposals for the alteration or improvement of an existing road involving the construction, whether or not within existing highway limits within 200 metres of the property or construction of a new road or alteration or improvement of an existing road the Council stated no but the County Council intend to improve the Dane Street/Station Road within the next 10 years.
The property lies within approximately 150 metres from this improvement but would not be directly affected.
Yours sincerely,
Miss
Sawbridgeworth, Herts.

Dear,
With reference to your telephone conversation with my secretary on the 15th instant when you confirmed that you had completed your mortgage arrangements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bishops' Stortford and that it was in order for me to deal with the draft Contract when it was received.
Bishop's Stortford
I have now received the draft Contract from the vendor's solicitors and I have accordingly despatched to them the Preliminary Enquiries arising thereon and also my local search with East Herts District Council.
I am asking the vendor's solicitors if they will accept a reduced deposit but in the meantime will you please confirm that the bank has agreed to loan you 95% of the purchase money.
I await hearing from the bank as to its requirements.
Yours sincerely,
Miss
Sawbridgeworth, Herts.

Dear
Bishop's Stortford.
I have heard from Prudential Property Services with details of your proposed purchase of the above property for £52,000 subject to Contract and I expect that I shall be receiving the draft Contract from the vendor's solicitors in the course of the next post but perhaps you will kindly telephone me and let me know whether you wish me to proceed with the Preliminary Enquiries arising thereon and the Local search with the East Herts District Council.
Yours sincerely,
Miss
Sawbridgeworth, Herts.
