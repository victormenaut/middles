Yes that's right.
Okay.
Yeah.
So that's okay?
Yeah.
Brilliant..
.
No in-date.
No they were called something else actually erm .
Let's have a look at the P L A.

I think we ought to remove that list.
Which list.
This list.
Erm, they've only got one size, and S F T thirty with protector .
That's right.
Yeah.
Nice profitable business .
Pardon.
Nice profitable business.
It is yes, and we've erm
So that should be a three O eight customer.
Yeah it should.
Outside of one size, we should only have one size on the net list.
It's impo let's have a look at the account number .
The price on the net list should be six pound eighty.
That's for the S F T thirty.
Price  six pounds eighty, latest.
Check price increase done.
Change  and date it to when?
Maybe er
Thirty one twelve
Thirty one twelve nine four yeah.

Er T L A customer, well yes yeah I think we should delete all ne dene delete the net list, remove er list  and end date.
Right that's okay..
Ah right.
we've erm we've done that.
Is that all we've got on erm
Yeah we're onto the next area  
Right.
Do you want me to just go through any others?
The other thing you've got is the fact that P O A customers will be on here, and therefore those P O As should be on here.
Right?
Right.
Plus these are over your horizon or the end of February.
Oh right, okay.
Yeah?
Yeah gotcha.
Erm , we've got we're in a situation with  where we've just put eight per cent.
We haven't affected their order book, but all future orders we've affected by eight per cent.
So this should be  by eight per cent.
It should be updated by  but not applied to the order book, do you follow me.
Yeah, sure.
Check price increase  of eight per cent for new business.
Not order book.
That's one one ninety four.
Er  end date, should  be  one ninety four.
So it'll be thirty one twelve ninety four.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well if you'd like to keep it at that, that's fine.
Yeah cos that then that then ends on that date and you negotiate for  
That's right, yeah.
And that's .
. I'd say that's the same thing myself.
Yeah..
this price.
No sorry no it isn't.
N one oh one three.
N one oh one three, N B C three.
N B,.
So  four five  seven six three one O one.
That's alright, that's no problem.
It's er
It's picking up onto the same list is it?
Yeah.
End date it's picking up off the same list.
End date, thirty first, of twelfth nine .
Link list,O nine O to I O eight three.
Good thinking.
.
.
Er that was automatic ninety th er November ninety three but we've had a problem with them so we're negotiating .
So that wants to be 
They've actually resisted.
thirty one ten ninety three.
Er end date.
I'm just bringing you up to date really, they've actually er resisted quite violently towards the reacted quite violently towards the erm price increase and er we've erm just sent them back, Peter's just writing a letter so there'll be a letter coming in  
So you see, that needs to go in there so that when it prints it out again, we come and ask you
Yeah.
what's happening.
And when you update it er which updates the whatever percentage it is, then we change the end date so that it is  
Right, fine.
Otherwise I'm getting paid .
No no that's right okay.
I understand.
That's how it should that that's how it should work yeah, I agree.
.
we've got this P O A actually.
Ah remove   net list, P O A customer.
I heard they were in trouble.
Have you?
I no  sorry..
Be the sa it's the all part of the same.
Well  precision for a while because 
Yeah.
of the redundancy situation.
Oh.
be a bit careful with that.
Engineering.
Oh that's   site contractor.
So the end date?
It should follow it's  list, and erm it it's one one ninety four.
That's right then.
Yeah.
So that's alright then?
I don't think you'll find it.
I don't think we'll find anything  should be the same, one one ninety four .
One one ninety four.
Yes.
One one ninety four.
One one ninety four.
Yeah.
's all the same.
Engineering.
?
Erm that's fifteenth of the second ninety four for some reason.
I don't know why.
Deferred.
But we've got  we do very little business with them, it's really an  account.
Well we should actually  we should That wants linking to erm  's account.
Can't at the moment no.
But I mean, our business with them is two hundred and nineteen pound.
Why we're worrying about them  I don't know.
They probably negotiate the list at the same time as .
No I don't think we do.
I don't think we do.
Yeah.
Okay, if we do it to the fourteenth of the second ninety four, er and then that'd come up, I can tell you what we cos Peter's just is halfway through it with Well I say halfway through it.
Hopefully he's halfway through it with erm erm  so that should come up.
Okay?
Okay.
.
No end date.
it's two  four O two four five O five or two seven.
remove
Yeah 
oh it's quite a big value.
.
Well let's not remove it, let's go let's erm put it November ninety three
Okay.
November ninety four sorry, automate so it goes automatic.
date to November ninety four.
Yeah.
So thirty one ten ninety four.
Okay.
no end date.
P O A.
Remove  from  net  ?
No.
Because then you get you get this which is .
Right and we'll be able to dummy this one will we?
.
Okay.
And you can clear this up?
Sure.
I know .
Carry on carry on.
Lead on Macduff.
Carry on regardless.
.
Yes,.
I've put all the  together under Peter  's responsibility.
Because he deals with  on the  
Ah right.
and since  are a big potential  one one ninety four I've got down here.
Yeah, it's only one .
Yeah.
Yeah.
And er
So it's still outstanding presumably?
Er I think it is, yes.
Do you want me to ch check for you?
It's just that if there has been a price increase, then the end date wants changing as well...
There's a letter in with that one..
Right so we haven't had a price increase?
No.
No we have we haven' we're halfway through it with  working out .
.
All the same, they should all be the same.
And the end date wants to be in as?
I don't think we can treat them individually.
Right.
You know, I think we should tie em all up with the same 
Thirty one well ninety th ninety it says ninety three .
Hang on, this  account number.
End date thirty one twelve ninety three.
It looks like they're all linked in
Yeah.
Thirty three, thirty four
They should all be the same,let's put them together anyway, even if they're not, we should put them together because erm  I mean they're all part of the same company anyway.
We can't tre we shouldn't treat them individually.
We should treat them .
Right,.
people.
One four ninety four.
End  date  thirty one  O three ninety four.
That'll stop this one coming up .
Engineering.
yeah, 's a  subcontractor.
So one
one one ninet 
Thirty one twelve  
Yeah.
.
That's okay.
.list price.
?
P O A I've got down here.
So
Somebody's 
Remove
No no  I don't think we should do that.
We could actually remove the net list right, but I think we should have a net list for .
Yeah but I don't think it's been updated for so long.
Mm.
At the moment erm Shane I've got a new enquiry in the system for a whole works, right,
Yeah.
What I'd like to do is reprice that and put that in as the net list.
Right.
Do you follow me, for the spares.
Yeah yeah.
But we need to put an end date on that.
Erm oh I see, yeah.
Otherwise it's gonna keep  up.
Yeah.
Erm  well  we can change this end date can't we?
Yes, if we put end date in as thirty one, twelve ninety three.
Yeah.
That's right.
So that keeps popping up, and then we get it right.
When we've got it right, we can put it to .
.
one one ninety four.
end date  thirty one twelve ninety three..
, Engineering,..
.
Er one one ninety four.
End date  thirty twelve ninety three..
One two ninety four.
end date  thirty one, one ninety four.
Er  Engineering.
November automatic.
November ninety three.
So check price increase done.
Enter  .
Enter end date  er thirty one ten ninety four.
Next one 
Er automatic, November ninety three.
Check price increase done.
enter  end date  what date was it again?
November ninety three.
Thirty one ten ninety four.
Yeah.
  
Cancel.
Take it out.
Remove net list  P O A customer.
Don't wan don't even want  it this far.
Okay well we'll do that later.
Okay okay.

, yeah, we're in the middle of that.
It's one one ninety four.
So that's okay.
So 
do a lot of work on that.


.
Er one one ninety four  negotiate.
So one one ninety four, enter  annual date  thirty one twelve ninety three.
Engineering.
Engineering, November automatic.
Enter end date, thirty one twelve, automatic?
So these should have had price increases.
Yeah.
Check price increase.
Thirty one twelve ninety four.
increased  .
That should've been automatic,ni November ninety three.
ninety three,.
done, thirty one ten ninety four.
that's automatic.
Ninety three.
November ninety three.
.Think of the money we're giving away by missing these.
They might have been done, it's just that we don't know.
No I know.
That makes it even worse.
.
Er one one ninety four.
Really for our business, it's  worth messing around now.
Erm that's  business, I think if you just put er eight per cent on that, just p whatever, if we've got a net list, put it out the way.
Ninety three, check price  increase  eight per cent done   thirty one twelve ninety four.
one six three three O three 
That looks a  reference.
M C three.
I think that's  ceramic coated bearings  isn't it?
Really.
Bit of a failure weren't they?
Well so we should certainly put them up  by eight per cent.
Er .
, automatic, November ninety three.
Check  price  increase   thirty one ten ninety four.
If not thirty one ten ninety three..
That's automatic again.
Industries.
, yes we've I've just just done those.
We're on to the next area now aren't we?
, one one ninety four.
Erm but I've been this is I've been progressively pricing this account.
Right.
We've had erm on those two  two two price increases on the O eighty eight which is the volume size,
Yes.
and we've just had another one on the B A C O ninet O nine O.
Yes that's why I've  the increase of twelve and a half per cent on it.
Right.
So you can see that er  that price seventy six of those, that price goes up to two hundred and something pound which is .
thirty one twelve ninety three was that?
Ninety three yeah.
Ninety three if price increase  not done.
should say, C J B G .
Yes, thirty twelve ninety four.
C J B G letter.
Yeah I think you will yeah.
Don't you?
I bloody hope so.
Cos I'm not doing this every year.
No but we shouldn't need to.
No.
We shouldn't need to.
Volumes is not until er later on in the year.
Third of April.
That's it yeah, first of the fourth ninety four.
that sounds okay.
Yeah.
Whoops..
Yeah.
thanks a lot  bruv 
is erm quite a circus cos they we've got two accounts, we've got  and the original equipment manufacturers.
Yeah.
And er it's a real game of soldiers, last time I had them up here and er oh it was quite fun really.
That's nice.
Yes it's good, yeah.
Well last year I've improved the margin on that something something wicked.
Cos er we went through it last year and I  all the sizes that we only supplied, I just put them up
Mm.
and er if they were if they weren't making a reasonable amount you know,eight and a half per cent, ten and a half on some of them.
Right.
And on the ones cos they were trying to s screw us down to the floor and on the popular metric where they I knew they were gonna they could find better suppliers, I was only about two per cent on some of those.
You know, one and a half per cent.
And I said to them, Look I've re-costed all this, this is your new price sorted, and he said, we can't see what price increase we made.
And I said, well, you know, overall it's gonna be what we said, you know I said, we I've tried to meet your targets, I said, but I've had to to increase some up fart higher than others you know.
. Got away with it.
Bloody Hell.
They believed me.
Oh dear.
Er  
.
Oh automatic that should be, eight per cent automatic.
Check price increase  done eight per cent.
If yes, enter  end date of which date?
November ninety three.
Thirty one ten ninety four.
Yeah.
.
Yeah.
Don't have to do it  done that one.
Dear oh dear.
Limited.
That should be automatic, November ninety three.
sorry about this.
That's alright.

Er automatic 
Quick.
  

manager of .
So this hopefully .
Yeah.
Right then.
Limited.
Oh dear of dear.
I don't think I've done any business really I think I've just written that account off.
So P O A customer.
P O A .
list.
What we could do actually is with a we could have a
I think I've just dumped it to the
.
We really ought to have these n these P O A customers with their pl with with their blind lists on the computer.
Yeah.
And we could factor em up.
Yeah.
So if you decide you want to some er eight per cent 
That's right.
Yeah.
Right, Instruments.
Well I think   do something like that.
They do something very similar to that.
Mm.
They have this blind list 
Er sorry  er  Instruments Limited.
Automatic November ninety three.
Check price increase  done
Is this print picking up people who haven't had a price increase then?
It's picking up people who don't have end date.
Oh right.
It gives us an opportunity to say, if the end date's not been done, has the price increase been done?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,with an end date have actually been done.
No because if the end date is .
If you have a look at the end date,price.
Price.
End date, thirty one ten ninety four.
Is that November?
Yes.
Yeah.
No.
No  not  end date thirty one ten ninety three..
P O A customer.
Let's write him off.
Got to be yeah.
P O A .
Seven two O four E T A.
Yeah, they use that 
  
Yeah that's right.
Yeah, you know all about that don't you.
Yeah cos you were in precision..
.
No.
.
Er .
I don't know anything about that.
Engineering.
, November ninety three, automatic.
Eight per cent thirty one ten ninety four
.


item.
Automatic .
check price increase
worried about this one.
I put that price up more than the standard, that's wrong.
This is one where I put the price up and then we went and wrote to him with a net price list showing a lower price than I'd put up and we had to reduce it.
So it's got to put up it's gotta be put up eight per cent, I can tell you that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, thirty one twelve ninety three.
I'm annoyed about that.
You know we negotiated one price,didn't get .
And then we we're sending them the net list and saying there's your new le er price 
Sending them the net list  
and he said, this is lower than what you'd said it was gonna be.
You know.
Took the legs from under us didn't he.
That's terrible..
.
do the next page.
Automatic .
.
Er  .
Right,, P O A.
P O A by the way, another thing I'm thinking of doing is saying, if you want a net price  enter in there, it has to come through a  manager or  
Yeah.
Good idea.
And er we'll have a a summary of what have got net lists and what haven't.
And then you say whether yes or no.
You have to sign it off .
Yeah.
.
Oh  this one.
We had some fun with it Yeah we just done this one.
Oh we're on fourteen, area fourteen.
Yeah .
One one ninety four it should be.
Yeah.
That's right okay.
Erm and then we've just done a letter to them with the new prices.
So that's okay.
Well 
We haven't done it yet have we.
Well I don't know whether you .
We've done a combined jobby here  erm We've done er .
here they are.
The prices should be .
According to that  dated the ninth of December.
Oh no that's wrong then.
Check price increase done.
Letter ninth of December.
nine twelve ninety three, if yes,ninety four, if not,.


Yeah.
this is P O A I think.
Isn't it?
No it's got a an end date  
Oh it has got one one ninety four, yes you're right.
Yeah.


Yes.
That should be er negotiate, one one ninety four.
Yeah.
.
I think we've put  I know we've put erm  eight per cent on on everything that's now outstanding so it should all go up eight per cent.
Check price increase  done eight per cent on new business, yeah?
Yes one twelve ninety four.
If not,ninety three..
Oh we c they cancelled them.
Oh is that what it is?
I think so, yeah.
Ah.
I assume so.
Yeah there's no there's no cost ass 
No cost.
So if it w it was after the receipt then it would be
Be
It would be a negative margin wouldn't it.
Yeah.
The profit would have been minus cos  the costs would still be there so it must be a cancellation.
Mustn't it?
That one is the same size isn't it?
Yes.
That's a C three fifths, the C M 
Yeah.
And then  no that's not the same.
No.
I dunno what's happened there..
That's a shame .
Limited.
er that should have gone up eight per cent.
Check price increase
I don't think that has gone up.
I'm pretty sure that hasn't .
eight per cent.
If yes
Ah yeah that's why  because because  our business was smaller but  business was big.
With our size we could just put up by eight per cent.
If yes it would be what date, thirty one twelve?
Well it's it's
That's right yeah.
getting frustrated.
in a very matter fact way.
He writes it all down, he sends it all in and expects the system to handle it..
Mm.
Yeah but sh he should I mean on the road, you should be able to just write in and say, I want this to happen.
That's right.
Yeah.
But it doesn't.
Yeah .
It doesn't happen on the pricing, that's for sure..


that's under review at the moment.
Just cos 
Carry on.
Just cos we can hear you when you're in here.
It's got nothing to do with that Roger.
Nice one Tom.
Touché.
Just tal talk into don't talk 
Just talk  
away.
There you are you see, and you thought we were joking .
Get on get on with your business.
Yes.
Right, what I've come round here for er I'm going to Israel in a month.
Oh right.
Right.
.
Yes that's right.
I wanted to talk to you about the things that er you've got  from the meetings and to just think about the pricing issues.
Erm and  what you might say .
Yeah.
Alright, well when you've finished here perhaps we can touch base.
Touch ba that's a good one, touch base.
signing out.
I don't know.
Yeah, erm  I don't think we increased this.
Erm we quote once a year for it really er Shane this is one that 
Mm.
comes out for tender.
Right.
And it should really it's I think we should put November automatic on that.
Thirty one, ten ninety
Three.
three.
Yeah and check that we've had an increase.
Check price increase.
Yeah.
I don't know whether it's been done or not.
I really couldn't tell you.
Eight per cent.
Check done.
Right that's okay.?
that's not mine.
That's okay I can  can I  
That's n yeah  that's well that's erm that's now erm erm .
So you ought to
That's my boy.
Yeah, you ought to get the dates in that for that.
Again that's in as well.
Right..
Yeah that's in as well.
These are national accounts aren't they.
Yeah, well that's in isn't it.
That's  That's not a national account.
No 
That's .
An area nine twenty?
Oh I know why administrative receiver.
Administrative receiver.
Oh right.
was administrative receiver and then it went over to  Limited.
Oh right.
So you need to check with  on that one just to make sure that area code's right.
Ok.
Fine.
Right.
with me.
That's it thank you, I've now been through the lot.
Smashing.
Now I need to talk to er .
Right erm
And make sure that she can
Yeah.
go through all that.
if I leave this here  through, I can tell her what she want what i want her to do.
That's it, and then erm then we take it to the next stage.
Yeah, well the next stage is as I say to   
 
one of the priorities is to get on with the price increases and get them done, right, you know.
The administration, even if it goes wrong, we can catch up with them later.
No cos that's the mistake we made .
Well alright.
That's the state the mistake we made before.
Yeah.
Well the I mean the we won't leave it too late will we?
I mean, there's a few that's been done that haven't been caught anyway.
Isn't there? you know there's 
 
a few we've increased.
Well that's what I mean.
Yeah we want em caught up  now.
Precisely, if we leave it too late then .
That's right I agree.
.
Yeah, I meant from me, I'm not I'm not doing any more and I'm not I mean, I'm just keeping this log
Yeah.
to administer the price increases.
I'm not going to do that any more Shane.
You're not?
No.
Only in as much as where we are.
I'm gonna continue with that 
 
Yeah.
But I'm not gonna c I'm not gonna administer if they're been done or not and double check every model.
Oh no.
No that's right.
That's what this .
Yeah.
That's why she  
Agreed.
Yeah and I'm not saying that you know, this is yours get on with it.
No no no.
No I understand that.
No.
If you like, I've been doing a job which I shouldn't be doing.
Yeah.
Right, it shouldn't be my responsibility to do that it should  it should be accepted that it's gonna be done.
It should be done.
Any decent run organization, it would be done.
Yeah.
go through the P O A customers.
Right.
Sorry  I thought we'd finished but we haven't.
Aha.
Er  Precision Engineering, P O A .

Don't know much about them, yes go on.
Well if you don't recognize them.
P O A.
Yeah.
.
Yeah go on.
.
They're either dead or No that's November ninety three so that's 
No that's a that's a that's it's only one size but we should have that recorded as a
Well  you see, that's the point.
Oh right.
Okay yeah, sure.

Yeah.
I was going to say to you, you know erm  engine of Peterborough,
Yeah?

I don't think it's one of our accounts.

.
When do these prices go up?
They don't.
They don't?
No they don't I mean, the whole point is with P O A is what's wh what we're doing is sorting out should the customer be on P O A or should be on net list.
If he's on P O A and he should be on net list, we need to change it, if he's on
.
Right.
Once we've done that we can then start examining the list to see what's on the list.
Yeah.
And on the P O A.
On some of these P O A's if there's a big potential, I'd like to have a dummy net list.
