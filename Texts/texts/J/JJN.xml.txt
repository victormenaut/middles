Erm  what, what we do today is to  way go back over some of the ideas about land reform and then carry them through to the ninety fifty er Agrarian Reform Bill.
Erm   what we've been looking at is  the process of land reform.
Tt  and we're obviously looking at a process of land reform which has, has undergone a number of changes and I think we, we've begun to see some of the influences on those changes and particularly over the, the last week or so the  this has .
Tt er  and i in a sense there's kind of been an upward trend in terms of progression through that, that reform but within that there have obviously been a number of  and in a sense what we've been coming to terms with is, is what has been causing those, those variations, those changes in that policy.
Tt and I think we've identified in a number of  different factors erm  er behind that, that trend and that  erm  i in a sense there's, there's the kind of distinction between the ideological approach and  the pragmatic approach  in that we, we've seen there is a, I think a, a broad ideological impetus behind the  reform in the sense that there is this long-term commitment to overthrowing feudalism.
There is this commitment to overthrowing feudalism through class struggle and there is I think this vision that under new society will be more egalitarian, not completely egalitarian
I think there is, there is an attempt to move in that direction for a set of ideological reasons.
But we've also seen that the various,th that there is a whole range of, of practical day to day  issues which have come up which have, have like distorted a s a straightforward progression along those ideological lines tt  and  in particular over the last  we, we've, we've identified the political and military factors erm 
 
which have been relevant there and the political factors during the  Japanese war, the  a need to form a united front, a need to moderate policy and then, over the course of nineteen forty six, forty seven, the need to move in a more radical direction, to go back to land reform and, and land reform a  scale in terms of absolute egalitarianism because that was seen as the way of, of mobilizing mass peasant support, particularly amongst the poor, most quickly.
So one of the influences on, on the progress of land reform is, is this interaction between ideology and pragmatism.
Perhaps er er  another way of looking at this would be to see it in terms of rightist deviations and leftist deviations and one might see erm the er the moderate policies  er of thirty seven to forty nine i in a sense as being erm  a rightist deviation, one might see forty six forty seven as being leftist deviations and  the left is seeking to overcome rightist deviations, the right seeking to overcome leftist deviations and you've got some kind of oscillation between the two.
Tt  so that th the er there's that aspect to it, which I think er complements rather than contradicts the, the ideological pragmatism one.
Another way of looking at this might be  to say  in a sense there are  there are two bits, one is identifying where we are now and identifying in relation to both  
 
ideological position and in terms of, of the practical realities, both in terms of rightist and leftist deviations, where we want to be.
So in any one point in time  the movement is going to depend on identifying exactly where you are at the moment in terms of any of the cycles and where it is you want to get to in relation to, to a particular situation facing you.
So I think there are, there are all those kind of bits which are there in terms of the understanding of, of where policy was and where it was going.
Tt now if we just take that, that latter point up for a minute we can
look in early nineteen forty eight  where we are,wh where the land reform process had taken the Communist Party  tt and then we could begin to look forward to  where policy was going to go from there in terms of the military, political, economic, ideological future  and what I'm going to do today to, to begin with anyway is, is to just consider where we are and where it is we're gonna go and in a sense we could, it might be helpful to, to put ourselves back in a position of being the central committee again.
Now what, what was emerging in the end of  last week's discussion  was that there's been the agrarian land law,land law of er  October nineteen forty seven, absolute egalitarianism  and a recognition certainly by the spring of  nineteen forty eight that that had overstepped the mark at least in terms of its implementation in that it had in particular led to the encroachment of  middle 
 
peasant  and that that had had adverse consequences in terms of maybe economic output, certainly in terms of mobilization, certainly in terms of, of political effect on, on the middle peasant  and therefore there had to be the, the correcting bit to this  and that correction comes either very late forty seven but particularly early nineteen forty eight  when the excesses of the, the campaigns and excesses against the middle peasants have to be, be corrected  and there are very clear statements from Mao that the middle peasant must not be encroached upon.
Perhaps a bit more than that, the old nineteen thirty three class differentiation documents are reissued  and they are reissued together with the supplements which we saw came out in the autumn of nineteen thirty three which  and, and those supplements where then extended to allow the middle peasant to  er up to twenty five, on some of the readings up to thirty percent, of his income from exploitation.
So it's not just the, the standard middle peasant who is being protected, it is if you like the well to do middle peasant who's being protected.
So there is, there is this very clear and I think very substantial protection for the middle peasant.
Over and above that, Mao is  is in a sense coming up with, with a new set of proposals.
He  he's arguing I think on a basis of, of the experience of the past few years  that the situation now in China was a, was a rather variable one, that land reform had proceeded at different rates in different areas  and because areas where different that had to be taken into account  and Mao explicitly was going back to the idea that in the newly liberated areas the policy would be one of rent reduction, interest rate reduction  and that rent and interest rate reduction had to be established for some time until the position had consolidated around rent reduction, around interest rate reduction  and once that had happened you would then be able to go into land reform itself.
In a sense Mao is, is adopting very much the position that he seems to have taken erm in nineteen forty five when he's, he's looking forward to land return but saying at the moment our policy of rent reduction, interest rate reduction will continue and at some stage we will then be able to move on into, to that reform.
So there's a clear policy for, for newly liberated areas.
As far as the old liberated areas were concerned, there was going to be a kind of land investigation  again.
There would be a reassessment of how the land reform process had worked.
Where it was found that middle peasants had been encroached upon, where it was found that middle peasants had been dispossessed erm  that position would be rectified and that would be given back to middle peasants.
So very different policies for the old and new liberated areas.
And in a sense Mao is saying that it's, it's not right to go straight for land reform, you, you've got to go for this policy of rent reduction, interest rate reduction first.
And alongside this  went a much stronger wash your face campaign  and the names of the , names of Party members were published.
Erm Mao was worried that as,i in the course of the, the latter stages of  directive and the   there had been abuses of the system by Party members and that had led to the Party getting a bad name with the peasants and the way to rectify that was to publish the Communist Party membership so everybody in the village would know who was a Communist Party member and they would be able to see, Mao believed, that on the whole Party members had behaved properly, they hadn't exploited the situation for their own advantage  and where they have they would be, there would be a  with them to correct.
Now  that I think is, is the position as of the spring of nineteen forty  
 
Can I just stop there for a minute er er is this the best  
 
any, any points  anything anybody would like to add to this?
Did you call it wash your fact  sort of?
Mm.
Yes I mean it, it can be, I think it can be .
It's not something which is introduced for the first time in nineteen forty eight but, but there is erm sort of another round of it erm and  sort of the new dimension is that the, everybody's name is published because until then you, you didn't er you didn't know who the Party members were.
Mm.
Right.
Now  we need to decide  where to go from here.
Now I, I, I er our, our, in a sense our policy now is that we're going to sort of readjust the policy in, in the north .
As we go into the south we are just going to conduct a rent reduction, interest reduction campaign and we, we will then aim to consolidate that position and at some stage we will then move forward into land reform again, but to do that we will probably need a new land law because we're recognizing the old agrarian land law is, is inappropriate,absolute egalitarianism  is now dead in a sense of as erm  it's sort of saying that, that as Mao is arguing in May forty eight, May forty eight that absolute egalitarianism is wrong.
So, so, so that bit of it we've, we've moved forward .
Er  are you happy with this idea that, that  sort of the immediate future in the newly liberated areas is, is just rent reduction, interest rate reduction, consolidate that and then move on?
Do does this seem to be the right policy?
It would have more affect in the south   
on the moderate side erm it would, would stand a better chance than 
Yes, right.
and as a starting point
Yes.
and there's more of a justified presence.
 
So that it, it would actually fit the conditions in the south in terms that we are, you're moving into an area of, of higher tenancy and therefore rent reduction, interest rate reduction is, would have a significant effect.
Right.
you say this rent reduction? 
Oh cos I, I thought they erm   they had the three different areas
Mm
but erm I thought  forty eight, areas where  and carry out 
Yes, I, I think that was  that was still when the  I think that was still in a sense under the auspices of the old agrarian  er of the  of forty seven  was still being given by .
Erm I think bro broadly, certainly by the time you've got through to the later spring th th there is  y yes I mean i in a sense there are sort of three areas if you like but, but very broadly the areas which had not been taken over yet i is very much a slower process of consolidation and then you wait for the next rule.
Er you're happy with this, this seems  okay in terms of policy  
Doesn't it seem slightly odd though?
In the sense that, in a way going on from what I was saying  on the face of it south China ought to be the area where  land reform will be easiest to achieve  in the sense that here you've got a society which is landlord dominated, heavily landlord dominated  and therefore w where one would expect that the antagonism, antagonisms between landlords and tenants would be at their greatest.
I in, in the north you've got a higher proportion of owner-occupiers and 
 
you perhaps haven't got the same degree of landlord exploitation, you might, I think one might argue from, from what we said earlier that in the north you've got a s a slightly more paternalistic landlord, it's, it, there's less, less absentee landlordism  landlords were more likely to have been behaving within the confines of moral economy  wouldn't, wouldn't have been  tt erm reducing rents, it was done on a much more, more personal sort of scale.
You move into the south which is the area where landlord exploitation might have been at its most intense, where you would expect antagonisms to be greatest, where one would expect that peasants would be actually demanding land reform and, and  indeed if you, you go back to, to the  you've clearly got that almost spontaneous underlying radicalism because of the, the intense landlord exploitation.
What we're saying on the whole is that we, we are moving south  erm militarily we, we now control most of north China, we begin to move on to the  into areas of very high tenancy where landlordism was thought to be at its extreme but all we're doing is reducing rents and interest rents.
I think if, if they adopted a policy of erm of struggle  last time, I mean they would get to land reform indirectly but I don't think you can erm initiate it from the Party as such like  because that causes all sorts of problems through definitions and things like that but  
 
yeah I think  right  but I think the way of analyzing  is through just saying  you, what are your grievances and then ultimately that will result in landlords being driven out.
Right.
So they've learnt that they can't implement land reform unless they've got the support of the popular masses and it's got to come from them cos ultimately they, they're pursuing land reform in order to get the peasant support and if that's not what they want there's no point in just erm  imposing it on them.
You've got to, the peasants have got to be demanding it themselves.
Alright, so what you've learnt from the experience in North China is that you are actually better off to go in fairly gently
Mm.
and  begin the process and then allow the peasants to kind of take it over, to become involved, to become vocal and to become activated.
And you've got to educate the masses and perhaps instil  erm more revolutionaries, sort of a more, a culture that actually sees that they're not gonna gain just material benefits but how that this is in order to advance society forward.
Mm.
Yes and take control of them in terms of direction and so on.
Yes.
Mm.
in a sense though you're putting a lot more emphasis on the Party.
You're saying it's the, it's the, it's the Party that, that erm mobilizes them, there is, there is actually very little spontaneous revolutionary charge within the peasantry.
That, that you've got to create it for them.
I mean by just doing this sort of settling of accounts is that creating it for them?
Er I mean is that creating a sparkle?
I think  I mean it's a, it's a very small sparkle  just saying  
 
now's a chance to erm  
Is, isn't the idea that 
most likely to make people believe that they can achieve a certain thing and let them get up and do it and erm  so that the Party's role is in the initial stage  fostering as much mobilization
Yes.
creating a common consciousness and then let the peasants go with that.
Not do actually do the land reform themselves, but to create the conditions whereby they can believe in themselves.
Right.
So land reform is, is, and this will be very counter to nineteen forty seven, land re land reform is, is not now the means of mobilizing the masses, you have to mobilize the masses for land reform.
And this rent reduction, interest rate reduction together with the kind of settling accounts procedure which presumably will come out of this is the means by which you mobilize the masses and once you've got them mobilized, you can then move on to land reform.
But it's, it's premature to go for land reform straight away.
Yeah.
I, I  
 
bring up this point about the masses being  were the masses revolutionary or not
Yeah.
and I remember doing my first, one of my first essays  erm saying that I didn't think they were and all that they were  erm  was the fact that er er of  and you said to me at the end  that's fine as far you've argued it but I think you'll change your views as you go on and I don't know if I have.
Right .
So erm I don't whether or not I s I still don't think they were ultimately revolutionary, I think they were just erm   people who they think were exploiting them at the time  sort of erm you know in a certain situation 
Just because they weren't revolutionary doesn't mean that they didn't have the potential to become revolutionary 
I know.
Sure.
Yeah.
and erm it was  
But they di didn't have the idea of revolution in themselves, they didn't have the idea of overthrowing the landlords themselves.
But maybe cos there was no opportunity, they didn't see there to be  I mean like they didn't know any better but as soon as, I mean things are rapidly changing they're given the opportunity to erm I mean through the struggles  to actually take charge of the conditions and to gain so some material and  perhaps there was beginnings of them seeing that well  perhaps we ought to look more to this sub-culture and to erm 
Well I mean it's 
change their values.
it's very  Party initiated isn't it?
The Party's giving 
 
putting these ideas into their heads of erm  creating a society in which  
But then the peasants surely should be able to choose to accept or reject what the Party is trying to  instil  in a way.
Yeah.
But I mean it's the idea, the idea is coming, is not coming from themselves, it's coming from the Party that, that er that you can create a system without landlords.
It has to though because if in the pa if they've had this  long-term sort of culture for all this time they need to be given ideas but essentially if their traditional values were so strong they would have rejected what the Communist Party was trying to say, but because they accepted it it meant they ha they did actually have the potential to be revolutionary.
And  going on from that surely we argue that the May the fourth directive  came about or certainly was, was put out as this is what the peasants  three times the peasants had demanded land return  I E they were in advance of the Party, they were more radical, they, they were, in a way they were saying look this, this rent reduction is not enough  we want a much stronger programme, we actually want the land reform.
And that's what the directive says?
Yes.
Well maybe they  
  
but that's, that's entirely logical  
 
the, the more you argue for this  economy, and the more you argue no this is, this really is how the peasant felt and he  that the peasant really erm  didn't have any ideas of changing society at that  of  the landlord system  the more I assume that  one would support this kind of rent reduction, interest rate reduction campaign which allows you to slowly build up that mobilization which is necessary.
The,th th th the o the other thing that is  I think, I think there is something in this, is that there was, at least within some sections of the peasantry, erm er a, a kind of erm revolutionary zeal which they were building themselves and they were wanting to go beyond the Party.
And, and that would derive from cases where landlord exploitation was particularly severe and therefore peasants were saying no  rent reduction, interest rate reduction is not enough, we want to go further than that now.
And I think there is that element there.
Mm.
And you think that's not just a sort of relatively recent phenomenon in the sense of  you know, the  sort of mid nineteen thirties  or you think it's always been there?
You know just an idea 
 
 
Yeah  whether or not you   whether or not you think it's been induced by the fact that, that they've heard  what happened in  and they think that they can start doing that as opposed to ch as opposed to just saying we're going to exist by creating  
sure, there may be some thinking that, there may also though be  er if you move through to the forties you're,y you're twenty years on from the nineteen twenties, you, you've had  and you've had deterioration in agricultural conditions er  as, as we've seen  you've got erm increasing landlord absenteeism, you, you've got a downward, an upward pressure on rent  in terms of how much was having to be paid in real terms, all of those things might have come together to, to, to push the peasant over and to push him outside .
It it's  it's a possibility
Mm.
erm   I, I don't  I, I would be a little unhappy saying the peasant still, in the nineteen forties, was st totally still bound by foreign economy
Mm.
but clearly there, there is an element of that, there is an element that they'd gone beyond it that's  that that bit  is difficult to define and quantify.
What was erm  how, how badly was the south by affected by the Japanese, I mean what were the peasants likely to have gone through in the last few years?
Erm they would not  have gone through the same sort of occupation.
Erm the Japanese presence in the south was, was more just along the coast, they, they, they'd taken the trading ports erm  and they had  some of the interior but on, on the whole south China had not been  dominated by the Japanese,th th th their base was very much the north China plain and, and spreading across towards  the communist areas .
I mean they cut in through Manchuria down the north to, to, across to north China plain, had taken the cities on the eastern seaboard which was what they wanted, I mean th th they really wasn't any point in  controlling the rural south, it would have taken so many troops, so much administration if they'd  that then they had everything they wanted from the trading ports so  there wasn't that Japanese presence and so the   clearly was different.
Mm.
So they're not trying to, you know, get themselves back together again having  erm you know, the Japanese having left and, you know  
 
the villages have been razed and all that sort of stuff?
Er there would have been some cases where that had happened  erm and clearly the nationalists had withdrawn from most of southern China into, into south west China and therefore erm  th th there'd been  er and there was quite a lot of fighting going, still going across south China so i it's not   quite the same .
the nationalists don't have so much of hold now over the south.
Er they do after, yes th the, the nationalists had moved back across the south after nineteen forty five erm  th th they'd, they'd retreated from the Japanese progressively after nineteen forty one and abandoned Shanghai and  etcetera.
They now moved back, in sympathy with the Japanese surrender, they moved back and the nationalists took Shanghai and really controlled the whole of, of south China again so that the, the old landlord system had been re-established.
 

Sorry you were going to say something.
Erm  no what  coming out of this is that how that  although one would assume in the south that the peasants ought to be more revolutionary, in actual fact it's the reverse and why is this happening, is it because of the fact that the Communist Party were in the n that maybe essentially  that the peasants in China er were reactionary and worked within the confines of moral economy, but because of the presence of the Communist Party in the north they became more revolutionary and that's sort of suggested by the success of land reform there and the fact that how, that they can't implement it in the south.
Or is it because there's a different culture in the north and south because the, the two parts of China are very different, so you don't know whether it's  the Communist Party that's determining this difference or whether it's just because of a difference of culture there.
And it's, it's difficult for us to tell because we don't have that  many regional studies  to be able to know exactly what it was that was determining  these differences of values.
Yes, but there might be some important differences that we would want to bring up, which we, we perhaps could take a bit further.
Erm there might for example be economic differences.
Now  tt  if you look at it this way,le let's suppose that the Communist Party was successful in its military campaign and it, it  takes military control of south China, which it was beginning to then, and did up to nineteen forty eight 
could you, and therefore its political position is becoming increasingly secure  erm and  the  there was no major military threat  to land reform.
There was no reason in terms of a  a, a military position why you shouldn't have introduced land reform in, in the way that  going through  and you are moving into an area where as we've seen landlordism was at its  
 
and peasant antagonism ought to have been greatest  and therefore you  on the face of it it seems surprising doesn't it that land reforms didn't take place immediately, or they weren't attempting land reform to take place immediately.
I mean if, if, if you were  looking from outside and you were going to choose an area that you were going introduce land reform   you would choose south China wouldn't you?
Now is, is the fact that they don't do that, they still go for this rent and interest rate reduction   is it  because of the experience of the north, they found that the best way in the north was to go for rent reduction, interest rate reduction and then go on, and they were simply taking that experience into the south, but taking it into a different area where it was no longer necessary or appropriate?
Mm.
It's not such a pragmatic thing then because  
 
one of things you said earlier on you said when you  do become very radical erm it's, the distinctions between  become blurred
Mm.
that erm one of the most important things is to keep up your production
Right.
and therefore if you're gonna er introduce this radical land reform straight away, I mean say  there is no landlord but there's a  peasant, or  I mean unless the Party's ac completely active 
Mm.
and they're gonna get hit.
Right.
And basically what they need to do is create  peasant  economy to increase production as they learn from the land.
Ah right.
So if you go too radical you're gonna hit production, and you're gonna step back which  
Right, and are you beginning to say that production is coming to be a more important criteria now?
Yeah I think so.
Well it certainly has  but there's still kind of elements of 
I think especially when they find out that there's not much land to go round as they ash assumed.
assume that if you give them  a population that owned seventy eight percent of the land and find out  fifty percent of the land , then you, you know, you can't just give land, everyone's not just gonna have land, you have to increase production to make everyone better off.
Mm.
Right.
So whereas in the north the, in a sense the, the main criteria was mobilization  as you're moving south in the new situation a new criteria is, is production.
  
you need, you need, you need mobilization you need 
Yeah.
support, but then even more you need production.
Yeah.
Right.
There's also another problem with land reform in  I can't really see how they could implement land reform without reverting to similar sorts of  they used in  which is  defining class distinctions and the chaos that that causes and the problems it causes erm  it is almost as if , if you go back to erm settling of accounts
Mm.
okay you're erm  you're getting rid of your communist ideas  you're  finding a smoother way to getting erm  to achieving a similar sorts of effects  
 
hit the top end  get a  cross-section o of, but you still get the same, ultimately the same sorts of results erm by, by erm by adopting that policy whereas if you go  for trying to draw distinctions, you end up erm 
Right so it's, yes, so, so, so the danger is, is chaos and the movement gets out of hand and  
 
Right.
One way around that might be then to have enough cadres on the ground in order to, to do it properly.
I mean even, in a sense you, you, you're worried about the excesses.
Yeah.
But also the administration of  and trying to rectify the  
Right.
Right.
S so the, the more  you've got, the less that is  
 
Yeah the, the less but I still think there's a fundamental problem with drawing the distinction 
Right.
Right.
Fine.
Erm but maybe this, this  issue is, is, could be important in the sense that you, you've got  tt er  if you take China as a whole you've probably got well in excess of a million villages  erm you've probably got a denser population in the south than the north so you've got more than half a million villages in the south 
okay, and if you're going to conduct land reform  you've got to have an effective land reform team to go into each of those villages.
Erm so you, you, and you, you're looking of, of land reform teams of four, five members  so you're, you're looking at somewhere between two and three million cadres to go into the villages.
And you've got two or three million cadres, trained cadres who know what they're doing, are experienced, who knows what the south is 
 
who know what the south is like.
So that there, there may be a, an important personnel problem th th that you realize that well okay  the option of going for land reform is, is there but you're saying  er it's likely  trouble  my experience of the past is that, that  radical land reform is, is disruptive  it could affect production, it could get out of hand, it could alienate people  in order to control them we need a lot cadres on the ground and we haven't got them.
Well even if you 
 
did have them would it, would it 
 
definitely be for the better?
I mean they were, they were still so corruptible.
Or had that changed  were they, were they mo more educated now and less corruptible?
Who?
The cadres.
The cadres.
Because to some extent erm
Yeah.
the rightist and leftist deviations were, were because of them.
Yes.
Er so you would  you would need a very heavy rectification programme to sh to ensure, not just that you had enough cadres, but that the cadres were going in with, with the right attitudes.
Erm  it, that would take time, I mean it's,th that would be very difficult to control.
Yeah.
You're right so it's, so it's not just in terms of the number of the cadre, it's the quality of the cadre, and, and you can't just erm  er I mean  you can't just pick, you can't   you've gotta educate them, create them etcetera, yeah.
In applying that how that they didn't implement land reform because it wasn't viable  but if  erm another way of looking at it is that how the Communist Party no longer saw land reform as the best way, means of achieving greater 
Yes.
egalitarianism and that how that  increased production was seen as the  you know, priority, and so perhaps they would want to just  I mean it might seem  appear that they were changing their policy to a more moderate land reform but this was  not an end in itself it was a means to an end in order to increase production which would benefit the population as a whole, so it's, they still had the same goal
Yeah.
which is to achieve greater equality but you're having different means to achieve that.
Right.
It, it, it's a different means to an end, it's a much slower means to an end
Mm.
in the, in the sense that i if, if you look,i if you adopt a sort of retrospective view, I E if you look back from say  anything after nineteen forty nine and you say look, hold on erm  this was the final stage of the revolution.
The communists had never been in a better position than they were in in, in nineteen forty eight, the civil war was, was clearly going in their favour  erm they were to achieve power within eighteen months  and at precisely the point where they had everything going for them, they are adopting the most moderate policy.
If there was any time when radical land reform would have succeeded, it was during nineteen forty eight to nineteen forty nine, and it's precisely that time  looking into an area which would seem to be the most favourable for radical land reform, they have not taken that opportunity.
how much control did they have over ?
Well they're getting increasing control, increasing control but not  and er so yo what you're saying is that, is that even if, if you go back to the reality of nineteen forty eight, actually they didn't realize they were going to get that control as quickly.
they, they were seeing  as being an, a longer drawn out struggle
Mm.
not, which, one which would not be over in a year and a half.
I mean we've, I mean at that point you've got  that was the point where you've got the massive United States aid coming in  erm  you, you've got erm  United States equipping China with all   enormous fire power, sending tanks in etcetera, I mean this was the beginning of, of the realization of the United States that, that the communists were a threat and they didn't like it and they, they were putting massive ai aid  erm and, and that there was all that United States war machine erm  
And this, this other thing as well about erm  which is obviously  and erm  I think what they had in mind was that before you start doing anything radical, before you start having any real land reform at all, you have to ensure that you really have control of that area, he's had this 
Yes, right.
experience of trying to, trying to put through land reform in erm areas which then led to  just incredibly bad
Yes.
cos all the sort of people  communists  they're all just full of hot air and just really get lost 
Right.
the important lessons they learnt cos at first they thought land reform would enable them to achieve mass mobilization
Yes.
but now they realize that however you need to have mass mobilization in order to have successful land reform 
Right.
Right.
and so land reform was no longer seen as a means to achieve their end that they  that and that  it wasn't the best policy to consolidate power, it was  you needed to have the mass support there first so that's why land reform was no longer seen as their goal so they didn't take it up at this point when one would expect them to pursue it.
It's, well it's still a goal but it's one step off?
Yeah.
Right.
So, so there are two bits, there's, one is th that you need the  the, the, the evidence from the north is that you need mobilization in order to get land reform and the way to get mobilization is rent reduction, interest rate reduction and then sort of the, the struggle meetings and that provides the activism  to go to land reforms and the other bit is, is the military one,th that you've learned that if you're going to go through with land reform and keep the support, you've got to make sure you've got your military security first.
Erm and because in, even in nineteen forty eight, you couldn't guarantee that  
 
you were better off to, to play it cautiously.
If you put the two together erm you  i it becomes understandable  why they, they adopted these policies to the south, even though sort of from what happened the first time particularly in a retrospective way, the expectation would be  you would, this would be the are where you would go for land reform straight away.
I mean in, in, in retrospect they probably could've achieved it  because they, they got the military er they, they, they did get the military security and  you probably could've afforded actually to, to mobilize the peasants through land reform.
I if, if you could have got some cadres on the ground, you know, so, so the other bit of this is  is if you are going to go for land reform you've got to have, not just the military presence and military security, but enough trained  honest  highly motivated cadres.
Surely erm part of the problem   
Ah right.
obviously 
Right so we, we, we also need a new  land reform document, because we can't use the  because egalitarianism we've, we've recognized from the experience of the north is wrong, that's not gonna work so we need something else.
Right.
Fine.
So one of the things we're going to, to do is to, to see what that new land reform document might be.
Before we do that can I just take up one other point.
, sorry
two reasons  policy, one was the er military secured area  
 

Erm   what was your question?
 
Wouldn't, wouldn't you need the peasant mobilization first?
Yes.
Before the land re before you could have successful land reform.
 
Sorry I lost my place.
Erm
 

Erm well th th th yeah but th th th there's, there's  the military security you need erm  you, you need  er tt  you've got to have the, the, the personnel to be able to do it
Mm.
and you've recognized that there are dangers if you, if you try and mobilize people too quickly i i it, it needs to be done slowly.
But is there also the, the, the idea of,a and in a sense  one thing you haven't actually got an appropriate land reform  
 
so you have to actually figure a new one out before we can  
 
?
Do you have something like a sort of  guide book, you know how to conduct  
  

Ca can we, that, that's  after 
 
break for coffee.
One other thing before that.
Is, is it possible to argue that the south is fundamentally different in terms of its ?
Tt  er if, if, if you go back to some of the things we were looking at last term er er this idea of commercialization  tt  er  argue that the south was a very different type of country to the north, that it is commercialized  at least to a much greater extent
and i if, I mean i if you take   's argument, if you take  's argument, they are all to do with, with provinces in the south  and, and the argument is that here we have, we are looking at a commercialized viable economy  and both  and  and for example are all arguing really that landlordism is not the problem  the problem is that you, you, you, you  you need to go further in terms of commercialization and that that, and that's the way to go.
I E you're not really looking at a feudal economy in the south any more  i it may be a much more heavily commercial capitalist economy  and therefore the kind of land reform programme that you might incorporate from a feudal north might not be entirely relevant.
So there might be something in the argument that, that  it's not just a, a question of what you've learned from the north, but there may be a recognition that  the economy in the south is different, or at least they might be arguing, those who are arguing that the economy in the south is different and that, that reform might not be necessary, it might not even be appropriate in the south.
It's a possibility.
Did the Communist Party know that though?
Cos surely they'd want to try to make peasants see that exploitation was  I mean cos there was still an agrarian problem in the south, just because it was more commercialized and economically viable there was still  thousands, tens of thousands of people who were starving and stuff so erm  did the Communist Party recognize this difference  in the economy, in the economic structure between the north and the south?
I mean we can because we've studied it and had all the statistics and stuff.
And would they wanted to have believed it.
I don't think they s th th they obviously didn't see it in, in quite the terms that  
 
but I think there was an awareness that there was likely to be much more opposition to, to land reform in the south.
Not s in a sense just by individual feudal landlords, but by landlords saying well I'm, I'm not really feudal anyway, that I've moved on from that, I am a commercial landlord rather than a feudal landlord.
This is the difference?
Mm.
You don't have any of this sort of  you have to work  
 
dates that they had sort of like bonds in which they have to work to supply labour for certain dates on their land instead of feudal ties  
Exactly.
yeah,
Yes.
as opposed to that was a part of being a tenant, you know, for the honour of  you pay me rent but you also come and work on my land for how many days 
But as such just because you're hiring people that's still going to be, in Marxist terms, seen as exploitation.
Right.
But it might be in   but it, it is, it is  
 
i i that was right,th th th there is a  i that they could be, if you like, capitalist landlords and feudal landlords.
Now capitalist landlords might be the  development  certainly in terms of production   you, you might be disrupting a viable, commercial, capitalist orientated economy, and would you really want to do that?
Well no if you tried to then you, you'd be in some difficulty  rules which, you know 
Yes.
commercial industrial  society  
 
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it might also be that   
 
the landlords in Saigon are if you like more commercial, more capitalist, it might be they were better organized than landlords in the north.
I mean th th th the clan links in the south were much stronger than they were in the north, and therefore there might be even greater commercial landlord opposition to land reform than there had been in the north.
Was the south not more erm densely populated as well?
Yes.
Yeah.
So you'd end up putting  much smaller sort of bits of land
Yes.
for each peasant which is going to harm production too.
So there's gonna be less
There's, there's less
inequality or
there's a greater pressure of population  therefore  are you saying that, that  land reform might  at least on the model tried in the north, might not yield any economic benefits 
Mm.
in terms that, that th th the erm land to  released would be relatively small?
Yes.
Right.
So the economic gains from  land reform in the south  might not be that great.
I mean you, the, the more you argue the south is a viable economic system, the less there is to gain from land reform.
erm  
 
and stuff like that  
 
I mean the amount of land each family will get   if you redistribute land, then the land for the family is not gonna be able to support the family.
Right.
But
Yeah.
Yes 
Mm.
Yes.
Erm  I, I think I might have missed Adam's point and I was going back to  whether the south was more efficient than the north because just tying it in with the seminar we had on managerial farms, weren't there more in the north than in the south?
And so then that would just prove that how, managerial farms weren't that much more efficient?
Er I think those are separate issues.
You, you, you're right to say that on the whole  there, the managerial farms were in, in the north, although there w there was clearly some in the south
Mm.
erm  I don't think this in itself said anything about level of efficiency of managerial  farms.
Erm I think it's, it's saying more about how  how we categorize this economy in the south, it clearly, it, it's not a managerial 
Mm.
erm  but that, the fact that there were managerial farms in the north might erm have er er important implications for the kind of land reform document we would want to draw to accommodate the situation in the north as well.
Yeah my problem is just erm having said that we don't think land reform should go ahead in the south because it's a fairly efficient set up  
Mm.
then the, the main problem is rent because presumably it all, all starts being creamed off the top so, okay you don't have to redistribute land, but you can still get rid of the landlords and the people who are erm  taking away the surplus
Right.
from, from the , you could either do it by a method of taxing landlords so heavily
Yes.
that it's  barely worth their while to erm to employ  try and get rid of them by doing that  er which er which means that there shouldn't be redistribution of land that much and therefore
Right.
S yes so   rent reduction will, could make a significant difference in the south because you've essentially got a landlord tenant society
Yeah.
and you, it might open the way for peaceful land reform
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean if, if you er er the whole experience of  was that you could get rent reduction and interest rate reduction relatively peacefully   so you wouldn't get disruption etcetera and you wouldn't get disruption and what, what you might come to recognize as a more , a more viable agricultural system.
So peaceful land reform based around rent reduction, interest rate reduction, might be the ultimate strategy for   given your learning process in the north, given the nature of the economy in the south.
So if you, I mean, to go back to our initial proposition, whilst on the face of it it seems curious that  in the area in south China where one would expect land reform to be easiest to achieve  the communists adopt a much more moderate, slower, cautious policy  but for a whole variety of reasons we, we're, we're tending towards the view that that would be the most appropriate anyway.
Yeah.
Right.
And er so, so, so we are er ou out of this it's er we're still, we're still committed to land reform are we?
We st we still want to achieve land reform because that ultimately is, is going to be the only way of ensuring that we end feudalism  and the proper benefits go to the poor.
So we, we, we've got in a sense this holding exercise of rent reduction, interest rate reduction but we are going to need a new land reform document to take us through, I mean certainly once we get to nineteen forty nine and we are in power,th th we, we are gonna want land reform aren't we?
Mm.
Sure, do, we do need land reform?
isn't it?
Right.
Okay so we are,w w we're now in a position of, certainly by nineteen forty nine we're, we're on the verge of power, we want  l we, land reform is not taking place any more, there are still some areas in the north it hasn't taken place  out in the far north west it hasn't taken place, so we, we, we are going to need a new land reform document based on all the experience we've got  which will carry us through and, and it's really  that land reform document, document that we are going to implement for the whole of China, and it's going to be that document which really is going to abolish feudalism and create  some sort of equality.
Well let's have some coffee and then come back and  
  

We've gotta devise a new land reform law.
What's our priority?
What, what, what really is the land reform  to achieve now?
of feudalism 
You've gotta 
Right.
Yeah.
Protect commerce and industry.
protect commerce and industry.
Yeah, I guess it's all  
Just looked after  go on.
Erm  well  erm it's that 
Yeah.
we are now in power  but I don't think  that presumably proved that we can run an economy efficiently 
Mm.
and
once we've got that then we have the resources from that I think to introduce other programmes that take
Mm.
quite a long time to implement, for example 
Mhm.
erm 
Wh when you're saying to run the economy, do you mean the rural economy or the economy, you know, China as a whole?
Well let's say we've moved on to and we're into nineteen forty nine say
Yeah.
and we've  in nineteen forty nine  
 
and  w w w we are either half controlled or we're, we can now see that you know the civil war is, is going so quickly our way that we are going to have control  within a year or so we are likely to have control over the economy as a whole.
D does that begin to make a difference?
Yes because now 
Right.
Yes.
So we then have to coordinate our policies
Mm.
erm  this is going to be really  hard work .
It's got, I mean, surely the, the middle peasants or even the rich peasants  the group of people that are gonna be most productive in the economy erm so you know your reform has to be fairly moderate in that sense that they have to be able to  promote 
Right.
economic growth and, and 
Right.
So in a very broad sense agriculture is going to have to con contribute to China's, China as a whole's economic development
Mm.
I E to, to, and will contribute to China's industrialization because once we are in control industrialization will be necessary.
So agriculture will have to play a role in that and therefore we want to increase agricultural output  and  in order to do that you want to protect the middle and rich peasants who are the most efficient producers, or I E managerial farms  if, if they are more efficient, you want to, if  you want   it would not make sense to take land away from rich peasants in order to give to poor peasants when rich peasants might be more efficient producers.
Well it depends how quickly the poor peasants can achieve more efficiency   how quickly they can do that.
Right.
Yes, so, so, so you're taking decisions in terms of well  which are the most efficient  
 
within the countryside and how can we create those m those .
That er that, that, I mean that efficiency thing is becoming an important consideration in a way which  we, we, we've not mentioned before.
Mm.
Well I mean surely it's, that's  the point now is to try to make a fair erm law and one that is ideologically erm designed seeing we've got to power, or we've got certainty of obtaining power, therefore land ownership has got to be  land ownership which has been  capitalism  Marxist 
So th th is becoming more complex.
I i in the past our aim with land reform has been very largely erm  we want to end feudalism and we want to maximize mobilization  we, we're now saying okay we, we still want to those, but we, we've also got to ensure that somehow we have a land law which ensures that agriculture will play a role in China's industrialization and so we will get maximum efficiency from the agricultural sector  as well as mobilization, as well as ending feudalism.
Er er we could  say that we've got a much bigger range of aims and does that mean that we are more likely to have  
 
it's going to be very difficult isn't it, for us to be able to achieve all of those aims  at the same time.
Well er I mean well things like communal ownership  advocate them to be  reforms 
You can move beyond the efficiencies of erm of the erm  managerial systems or the existing systems by erm creating, you could do coll collectives and then using state support to erm bring in erm more capital
You reckon  state collectives do you?
Well  well you, you can advocate erm mutual aid and all these sorts of things which erm  which are erm a step towards, I mean I'm not saying they're directly 
You can encourage it without  how the
Right.
agricultural system works.
So you might actually want to put something of that in to your land reform  
Yeah and, and you can have erm through loans etcetera you can start increasing 
Right.
capital which 
Yes.
you could get into a situation which is beyond managerial farms anyway because you've got more capital  
Are they gonna have the resources to do that though?
From the government.
Ha?
It's from the gov the government  
But where does the government get the money from?
The same place it got the  the erm tt the money for  
 
twenty er twenty  or something in, in loans.
Well 
 

I dunno  
wouldn't you, and that's what's  
 
Well yeah  
 
Right  questions er on that , yeah, okay.
Erm  going back to your point, we, we are operating within the context of a new democracy, right, which is, is, is broadly a kind of democratic  approach erm I E that it's, it's an indication of a sort of  the bourgeois revolution but within that you're saying it's not just a democratic revolution, it's a new democratic revolution and within that there will be elements of socialism being created.
So we, we are not just creating capitalism per se we are building in that direction er  but there will be elements of socialism there which we can then build on and take us forward.
So our, our land reform is going to have to reflect that so you would expect to see elements, perhaps, of socialisms being created.
Okay.
So, so th th that would be some of the thinking which would lie behind sitting down and, and  and drawing up a, a reform document  a land reform document, in the very late nineteen forties.
Sh I mean to, to my mind, shouldn't the land ownership possibly  one of the key issues cos that is  if you have land ownership and  then you're just paving the way for the new capitalist society and to, you know,according to Marxist theory  which I think is a pretty dodgy one,they have to go from capitalism to achieve socialism  
Right.
socialists , which is just a load of rubbish if you ask  
 
Okay.
But, but, but, but our experience of the past  
 
did not get the peasants to support us unless we give them that.
Yeah.
That's right, so that's what I'm 
 
saying if, if  
want to do that 
abolish land ownership then it would suggest they're going for a ideologically based
Right.
land reform, if they don't it's suggesting it's just another means of obtaining power by fragmenting  
Erm or, or a pragmatic in terms of erm you want to minimize disruption, you actually want to get production going and the way to get production going is to give the peasants  the land themselves.
Yeah, that's right.
Which isn't really erm compatible with social with communism.
I don't see how you can argue it is, I don't see how anyone can.
Right.
Erm but it
Shh 
It would suggest it's just not a transitory stage.
But, but but ending feudalism is the first important stance.
Well that's what they argue, yes.
But I mean feudalism
Okay.
it's hardly communism is it?
Erm no, but you're, at least you're getting out of feudalism.
Well yeah but  capitalism  
But you can't go straight for socialism or communism.
Well that's what they said but why not?
Because
I mean that's just rubbish, they said you have to go to 
 
capitalism and then, then naturally evolve into socialism  communism.
Well, but we, no we're not saying that, what we're saying is that we  so all we're trying,w w w that they were saying we can't go from  cap er from feudalism to socialism  but we don't want to go just from feudalism to capitalism, we want to go into er if you like a capitalism with socialist characteristics.
We, we want there to be elements of socialism built into the capitalism we're creating which will allow us to go straight into, to socialism in the future.
Mm
And  supposed to see the  superiority of socialism in this capitalist  
what  socialism anyway?
Well there was a, there was a debate  or something and that's when the committee  
 
Erm  I'm not sh w w well would you really have, have, have worried about that at the time?getting out of feudalism  then why  exactly how you're gonna go from there.
I mean as long you are going  in a way which is setting up  getting through to socialism as soon as possible, I'm not sure  there would be any point in thinking  about those issues until you've got a bit further.
I mean I'm, I  I dunno.
I was just, I mean  did they really believe that  it would, it would just lead straight on to socialism?
I, I, I think they probably believed that, that, that the best way to get into socialism was to begin to create socialist elements from the start, that would facilitate the move  erm  and once you'd got full control, I mean this is where, where there might be kind of bits  you can say that once, once  we, we need to make these assurances to get us out of feudalism.
Once we, once we are out of feudalism and once we have political control we can dictate wherever we want to go  and once we've got full control  we will go into socialism.
But as of, as of nineteen forty eight forty nine, if you'd said  you'd gone into a village, right you guys we're going into socialism, we are gonna create  collective farming  the peasants would have said no.
So there position in nineteen forty nine wasn't re in effect all that secure cos
No.
of the personnel that
Right.
I mean th th th th they were on the way to military security, but were they going, they, they, they recognized they had to carry the population with them.
I think there, there was a genuine democratic element to this that, that it,i i i it wasn't going to be forcible socialism, it was going to be socialism which would come naturally because that would be what the population wanted.
Mm.
And that, that would come  gradually.
Well you, you could do the sort of token gesture of giving them the land like they did in the past, at least that's showing what some sort of  communism
In order to get the support, yes, and to or in order to end feudalism, which was, was the, the priority.
After that it's anybody's guess.
Okay.
Let's, let's have a look at the, the document   
So have you all got one you can  you can see ?
So, article one    feudal exploitation by the landlord class shall be abolished and the system of peasant land ownership shall be introduced in order to set free the rural productive forces, develop agricultural production and thus pave the way for new China's industrialization .
So that the, the, the two main aims are, are stressed there, you are gonna end feudal exploitation  and you are going to create a new system which will set free the force of rural production in order to pave the way for new China's industrialization.
So for, for the first time  the revolution is given an economic goal in that it is to set up industrialization  and in a sense  the ending of feudalism and the creation of industrialization emerge as, as the two forces whereas up until now it has been feudalism perhaps egalitarianism.
So it's  we, we've already, that, that already has changed significantly.
Er you've then got a series on  confiscation  confiscation and retribution of land, so article two, land, draught animals, farm implements and surplus grain the landlords  surplus houses  shall be confiscated.
other, other property shall not be confiscated so you're gonna take all the land, animals, implements from the landlords, you're gonna take their surplus grain, their surplus houses into the countryside but, but nothing else you, you're gonna take from landlords.
Er you're gonna take in rural land belonging to, to shrines, temples, monasteries, churches, schools, organizations etcetera etcetera etcetera   industry and commerce shall be protected from infringement, industrial and commercial enterprises operated by landlords  and the land and properties used by landlords to  greater industrial  shall not be confiscated  erm you, you're worried that if you confiscate them they're simply broken up between people and those  productory forces are disbanded.
So  you, you, you're taking  landlords farm assets, but you're not taking their industrial, commercial or urban assets at all.
And then er revolutionary armament d dependents, farmers, workers, staff  professional workers, peddlers and others who rent out small pro portions of land because they're engaged in other occupations, or because they lack the labour power, shall not be classified as landlords.
If the average per capita of land held in such  does not exceed two hundred percent of the average per capita land held in the locality it shall remain untouched.
So there's a group within the village that you are going to allow to own twice  the average  
 

So you're enshrining inequality within it.
Is there a  a sort of suggestion of reward here?
You know there's some tenants  
Well, er sure but what about  commercial workers and peddlers  and others who  
 
 

But there's already inequality by not stripping the landlords of anything but 
Yeah.
Tt  and then we come to rich peasants, land owned by rich peasants and cultivi cultivated by themselves or hired labour and their other properties shall be protected from infringement.
So anything that the landlo er the rich peasant owns and works himself or cultivates by hired labour  you're going to allow to keep.
And, over and above that, small portions of land rented out by rich peasants shall remain un untouched.
In certain special areas the land rented out by rich peasants may be requisitioned in part or in whole with the approval of the people's government at  level or above.
You  special permission to encroach on all of the  rich peasant's land he rents out.
Why do they use the word requisition instead of confiscate?
Does requisitioning have the same connotations as confiscation?
So they are  they're being harsher on landlords but on the rich peasants they're just taking back the land instead of 
requisition, if you're in the position say   then it's like it's for a common cause
Mm.
 
if you take away some of the  land  confiscate's a punishment.
Yeah.
At the end of the day the effect is the same.
So i it's another, well it may, the effect may be the same but it's another way of drawing distinctions between landlords and rich peasants and you are treating landlords differently from rich peasants.
And then the last  is if the portions of land rented out by rich peasants of a semi-landlord type exceed in size the land held by themselves and by their hired labour the land rented out shall be requisitioned.
But that would seem to imply that only if a rich peasant rents out more land than he owns and works  either by himself or hired labour, he will be able to keep that  all.
So a rich peasant will be able to keep all of the land he was working himself, all the land he was working by hired labour and land that he hired, er that he rented out as long as the amount he, he rented out did not exceed all of the land that he worked himself or  used hired labour.
Pretty generous position for rich peasants isn't it?
That's not clear exactly what that last bit says cos it's not saying like you  all of the land they rent out, but I guess it just means the excess above which
Right.
I think if I was a rich peasant I would be using that to argue that you could take my rented land, it was 
Well so would I.
A leftist nut-case might   
Right, yeah but  fine.
But I mean th there is, if, I mean , that is generous to rich peasants.
It also sort of encourages them to  farm as much land as they can to presumably rent more out.
Yeah.
Right.
Land and other properties of middle peasants, including well to do middle peasants, shall be protected from infringement.
So we, we, we're still working to middle peasants being able to earn twenty five or thirty percent of their income from exploitation, either hired labour or renting out land and we won't touch it at all.
So the, the  the only land that we are taking in  is landlord land  and the land that rich peasants rent out over and above, if er in size larger than the land they are going to continue to work, either themselves or with hired labour.
Er we're not, we're not touching middle peasants at all, they're sacrosanct.
So they're still, they were still keeping to their aims of achieving greater equality, it was just not absolute equality  egalitarianism.
That is   you, you, you're miles away from absolute egalitarianism.
But
to rich peasant economy.
This rich peasant economy ought to benefit the population as a whole because it's increasing production and erm if it becomes more efficient then  the rents won't have to so high  the poor peo poor people benefit.
Yeah but the only thing you're really doing is, is taking away this nominal erm exploitive relationship, you're still gonna be exploiting the  of existing 
Mm.
and you might, you might  but there's still gonna be erm be certain divisions in the society  perpetuating.
I actually think it's, it's, okay it's a more equal society, but it is by no means an equal society you're creating.
So I mean   well let's go on then.
The  distribution of land, all land under  of production  confiscate  with the exception of those to be nationalized  to be taken over by the  Peasant Association, the unified  
 
distribution to poverty stricken peasants who  their land .
Production landlords should be given an equal share  so that they can make their living by their own labour and thus reform themselves through labour.
Er  land should be distributed by taking  village as a single unit, that should be distributed in a unified manner according to the population therein based on the principle of allotting the land to its present tiller and making necessary readjustments in land held by taking into consideration the amount, the quality and location of land.
So i it, it's the old nous  quantity and quality coming in there.
Er but basically  you're going to give land back to the people who are tilling it because that's what they, they have an attachment to.
Er  and then going on to article twelve  under the principle
of allotting land to the present tiller, land owned by the tiller should not be drawn upon for redistribution.
When rented land is drawn upon for distribution proper consideration sh should be given to the present tiller.
Land he acquires through distribution plus his home land  shall be slightly and suitably more than the land held in arbitrary distribution of the peasants who had little or no land.
should be the present tiller should re retain the approximate average per capita land, land holding in the  in the locality.
So  if you already own land  you would end up with a larger unit than if you owned no land before.
So  we are looking at creating a society with our  rich peasants  who are going to own significantly more than whatever the average is going to be, and significantly more than middle peasants.
We've then got well to do middle peasants, we've got middle peasants  who would in turn 
 
own more than a part-owner, part-tenant before the revolution, who after the revolution would own more than  a full tenant before the revolution.
Maintaining differentials 
 
 
Well basically, apart from landlords and  the  
 
peasants, there's er something for everybody.
Yes.
But landlords, oh no but they  
Lan lan er and landlords get some land.
Mm.
Mm.
So you are about as far away from absolute egalitarianism as you can get, you are actually enshrining  
 
You are creating a  system within the countryside  which is based on inequality.
And then there's a, a series of er  oh and they add er er during  the people's governments or at or above the  may in accordance with the local land agency set apart certain land bound to be nationalized and used for the establishment of experimental farms  or one or more county's or model state farms, so there's provision for the creation of so a form of socialism over the countryside but it's, it comes a long way down the list.
Quite token isn't it?
And very token, mm.
 

So our final document when, and this is, this is issued in June nineteen fifty, we are in power, we are a communist government  and our land reform  is one which enshrines inequalities, it protects middle peasants  it in effect minimizes what it can give to the poor.
There is, there is no egalitarianism whatsoever.
There is very little provision, there is, there is token provision for the creation of socialism.
And, and this is what revolution has produced.
At precisely the point where we could have been at our most radical we are at our least radical, this is the least radical document that we've come across.
 

Are you happy with this?
Not particularly but I  understand that er it is, you now have the whole of China which  small areas  erm relatively small areas, you've now got the whole thing, I mean if you start initiating very radical reforms, as you say you don't have the personnel or the resources to erm to prevent a, you know, a big change  disruption.
Yeah 
Presumably you've gotta start somewhere haven't you?
You know  you've gotta start somewhere, you can't just , you've gotta start somewhere 
Yeah but the  
establish the principles
This is where you want to start then?
What?
No that's what I'm saying 
 
I'm saying that you know  you, you should er perhaps try to establish some  underlying principles to your policy.
But isn't there, isn't there a big difference between  sort of recognizing the faults of past land reforms and advocating something like this?
Why?
I mean it's not merely recognizing that past land reforms didn't work, it's a totally different policy.
Th th th this in effect is creating capitalism in the countryside.
Mm.
You've got private owned , you've got inequalities.
So the  
 
creates capitalism.
That's only because you're looking at it in a very short- term perspective, they, the way they saw the communist revolution was by a very long drawn out process  and so it wasn't that the revolution had just created this was, this was an important step in order to lead to their ultimate goal.
And it just goes to show that the Communist Party were very forward looking but 
I, I would, I would be very surprised if the communists understood how  deterministic idea of erm some sort of progression, I think     you can't really say in about ten years' time we're gonna be here 
So it was pragmatic but it could also fit into their ideology in that how, that if they'd gone straight for socialism 
Now come on, this, this is disgraceful.
There's no  this is a disgraceful 
No but if they'd gone straight for 
document for a communist party to base land reform on.
There's no ideology  at all.
Absolutely, absolutely none.
I think it's only pragmatic in that  it's maintaining production levels.
Or helping production but 
So is this what, they certainly ?
Yeah, this is it.
This is  
That's 
No, no
No but I mean the basis of it was presumably landlord out and China was based around this
Yeah.
Well it was for the next  two years.
They didn't  
  
No, no.
Oh right.
I mean this, these, these, these 
Well that's alright then.
No, I mean we would, no  
So I mean this is just another basic erm  
Yeah.
Well in fact it, it it has in fact gone full circle because through the nineteen fifties you went through to co-ops to collectives to communes which lasted through to nineteen seventy eight, the communes were then disbanded and you're back, now, after reform which took very much system.
But, you know, if, if, if I'd have put, when we, when we started to talk at the beginning of this term we had at the beginning a general discussion about what are we gonna put in land reform, if I'd have come along to s to you and I'd said well I think we should do this 
We'd of laughed.
Right.
And I, I, I, I, I, I would not have endeavoured to persuade you that this was going to be  the land reform document that was, that  this is it.
It doesn't surprise me that they did it.
But this isn't this is it?
I mean you said two years later  change.
Ah well sure but then the whole lot goes, but, but, but, but, but this was, this was the document, I mean the way this was put forward, this is going to last us through into the foreseeable future.
Erm  you know,th th th this er er it was a medium term horizon on this at the time.
Are you saying that they didn't mean what they said then?
And that  I mean cos Mao said that how that you needed to have a moderate policy, that was the correct one 
Absolutely.
in order to ha to achieve one's goals, are you saying that how look well you've just got to assume that they were wrong  that they didn't mean what they said?
I mean it's perfectly 
Yeah.
legitimate to think that how that they did think that this was a short-term goal in order to achieve their long-term  objectives.
One, one might argue that  erm one might argue that there is a cynical implication thereupon, one might argue that  but, but in i i in exactly the same way at the moment you might argue that all the assurances they've given on Hong Kong are, are not worth the paper they're written on and, and, and as soon as the, soon as you get through to nineteen ninety seven they'll walk in.
Er  are, are you saying no that they, they are not  er
But you see they wouldn't have been able to realize their goals in nineteen forty nine.
I mean, okay 
Why not?
supposing if they had 
fifty they could, they could have gone  they could have gone  
But could they?
Were th were the peasants ready for it?
Is that what the peasants wanted at that time?
Ah.
Well okay bu but in that sense are you saying that the learning experience was such that the peasant was so conservative and reactionary and so  was all you could do?
Yeah which peasants are you talking about?
Mm.
Are you talking, saying the peasant, I mean it doesn't mean anything does it, the peasant?
Mm.
all peasants.
I mean it may just depend upon how secure the 
How, how would you have felt as a poor peasant  
   

I mean it really does depend upon how secure they were and how much, how much support,ge genuine support they had of the, the masses as a whole, because if they didn't then there's no way, and people weren't calling for them to establish socialism at that time were they?
Would they have known what socialism was?
Exactly.
And so how can the Communist Party 
But I mean  
just say right, we're gonna do this, this  
Just because they don't know what it  socialism  
theoretical concept or something, they might have known that they wanted  
Yes but it's the basic underlying concept 
capitalism and becomes rich as the we western world then th they'll be all for that 
No, I just find that  really difficult  because they didn't have the means at that time to achieve it.
I mean we've already established the fact they didn't have, they didn't have the personnel to 
.
Yes they did.
They were in power.
They were in power but I mean who's to say that the pe there's not gonna be a civil war and they'll be thrown out of power.
So why did they think that they had the er  means to do it in nineteen forty seven?
You know when they said, when they went for a very radical policy  
Well perhaps because they were more idealist and that now they're becoming more realist but they're still  erm I mean they're learning from their past mistakes and they've seen that right so we have to have a moderate policy which is gonna take us a little bit further towards socialism.
They're not totally contradicting their ideals.
Oh yeah  
 
It confirms our suspicions
at the last gasp we were right.
 

It's all this absolute power corrupts actually isn't it?
Mm.
Erm the, the people who  did Mao ?
Or ?
Well I mean  there, there, there's no question about nineteen forty nine absolutely non no documents  could have come out unless they had Mao's approval.
Mm.
Er
Did he shoot the other people involved by any chance?
that's behind this
Right.
erm
I E it's the same person who comes up with  
I mean yeah as you say he's very high personable person, there must be some reason behind it  er and a lot of the theoretical reasons that he says of 
 
of ideological progression, maybe he thought that, that, that erm the only, ultimately the only way to capitalis er to communism was through capitalism and he needs to establish a period of capitalism first.
Sure yes.
And that's what sort of Marx said.
So that 
Yeah.
yeah but it doesn't mean that they're selling out completely does it because it
Mm.
it means that it's just, it's a realization of, of the progression of communism  is to establish a capitalist phase.
Okay.
communism rather a, a weak theory doesn't it?
It's like saying  
Well Mao would do anything  the Communist Party, let's make it capitalist society.
No because if you look at Marxist writing it's,i it's, you go through certain stages and you can't achieve  
That's right.
And that's what's happening to us now  
 
That's just, that's just  but why does it have to happen?
It doesn't.
If they really wanted they could've just gone straight for it.
If they'd really wanted to.
 
They wanted to make it work though and they couldn't have made it work unless  they had had the  I mean the right conditions to do so.
You could have you could have made it work.
 
You could've made it work if the peasants if the peasants were revolutionary, if the peasants had  changed their value system and weren't  and that  there were very few who were still working within the  economy.
So er 
Are are you saying this is all that was possible because the peasant really was a capitalist at heart?
Well it was very likely that this policy was gonna succeed 
In what?
and they was gonna take a bigger risk, in keeping  them in power   so that they can achieve  their longer term ends.
But sh sh sure they can succ succ they can succeed in creating capitalism, it, it  it, it might succeed in  paving the way for new China's industrialization  but we've gone a long way from any  any ideological position, we've gone a long way from  well what is in the best material benefiting class of the poor peasant now  the poor peasant is not gonna get very much out of this.
It seems as if a disillusionment, the communists are trying you know, trying policies 
Yeah.
and they're still not bloody work what can we do?
Okay well  we're in a really bad situation, I mean we can achieve something at least and perhaps  oh perhaps communism doesn't work after all, they just seem to be doubting their own beliefs and what they've read.
And that's the only way I can see a way through this, thinking okay they've got this ideology, they've tried it twice and it still hasn't worked.
Let's go back to the drawing board and try something else.
Cos this, this is definitely not communism in any sense.
Right.
I mean  does, does this document surprise you?
I mean is 
Yes.
is that what you thought the nineteen forty nine revolution was all about?
I'm not surprised it's come back erm  to, to a sort of right  is this an expression of mass mind do you think?
What do you think?
Cos if it is  communist behaviour  
There is, no there's no mass  argument because you've got 
Why not?
this different situation
that's not mass minded.
Well it's quite, I'm sure that I'm sure, I'm sure that a lot of, I'm sure the rich peasant 
Well there's about eight people  
cos really they're the only f you know they'll be going yeah that's my mass line alright  
Well of course it is, yeah  but that's not  thing is it?
Well, it is for them you see,
 
there, there's no such thing as an absolute mass line, the mass line in particular  two types of people.
No that's not a mass mind then is it?
Exactly.
well there's no such thing as a mass line then is there?
 

but anyway we, we, we'd better stop there.
But I think it's important we've, we've now got  what  what the policy was.
On the face of it it looks very much as though this is erm   very little social justice   
 
what, what I hope we'll do next week is to, is to take that idea up and to see maybe why this policy came through  erm and we'll look at the, like the arithmetic of that as to, as to how much money there was, how much land there was in fact.
Mm.
How you could actually achieve a distribution.
So I think for next week  I'd like to be looking in some detail, there are two sources on this one is, is  and the other is ,tho those two are crucial in terms of understanding or, and   and that those are crucial in terms of understanding erm why this  policy document .
Er who's doing next week? 
 

If, if you're stuck for them come and see me cos I've got them
