The er  gentleman said, Yes approved yesterday, Mr 
Good yes they nor they normally let you know there and then the the 
Right.
the outcome I mean  it's very rare that we do get a refusal .
Yes.
It was  rather comical actually because he said er, You must now go and make an appointment to see Mr , and I said, Well actually we already ha 
We already have.
He said,I'll catch him out on this one .
.
Yes sometimes when we get people that are anxious to start immediately you know we make the 
Of course.
interview there  there and then even before 
Mhm.
we've actually got the the letter back saying, Yes we can sign 
Yeah.
you  onto the scheme.
Right, okay  like  schemes there is quite a bit of paper work to do
Okay.
So this is actually  this first form here is an application for the scheme
Yeah.
so if you want to start sort of scribing 
Okay.
away, and if there are any particular  queries on  that you want to ask, please do.
In the meantime I shall  complete one or two of the others.
Okay.
In which case I will suspend this until the talking starts.
One query only.
Yes.
Erm  will my business have any links with another business?
Erm 
In the context of the Enterprise Allowance Scheme  no no no no .
Probably not.
Yeah  .
.
Because I  I wondered wha to what extent those  those links were in that I shall have  obviously informal links an and talks with other people who are doing similar things  than what 
Yeah, yeah.
I'm doing, but they're not formal business links .
No no.
So that'd  no that that's quite alright.
Please check and make sure I've done things
Yeah.
.
I don't know who reads all these forms  anyway  but erm  
Well th they're there in case they're needed I think you see 
Yes that's it.
And the government auditors actually sort of er  come round.
I I misread previous  the word previous 
Word previous.
in that.
These are  these are estimates ?
Yes yeah  it's basically a question there  to ensure that people don't just put down that they're  whatever they're doing just purely  
Wal walking the streets for twenty four hours  a week  .
Yes.
I it's to cover the other things like doing the book keeping,
Yes.
doing the marketing and your advertising and general 
Yeah, yeah.
networking.
It's not just purely .
yeah.
Yes.
Well I haven't included the advertising of things in that.
Maybe I should?
Erm  sole trader, yes.
previous employer, yes.
Right.
There will be 
Yeah.
in that Nottinghamshire County Council was my previous employer.
I've actually heard from them today
Good.
from the  Personnel department asking for details of what I was offering because the  medical reports had now gone to the medical officer.
They could see no reason why he would turn them down and they're setting the paperwork in motion to put 
Good, right, right.
me on the appropriate lists.
So er  that's coming.
Do we have any indications   approximate percentage or 
I've said to them that I'm prepared to work for them.
Obviously I'm limited by the terms of my  erm pension  situation.
I've said I'd be prepared to work for between two and three days a week 
Right yeah.
for them.
Yeah.
I mean that  need not necessarily be kept.
I could undertake a whole week's worth and then 
Yeah, yeah.
do nothing for a fortnight of course.
It depends on demand.
there's school holidays and  .
Of course.
Yeah no  no that's okay .
right.
I mean they're all  basically for different schools anyway, but it just so 
Of course yes.
happens they come under one  education authority .
It's a it's a rather a debatable thing as to who is actually your employer.
That's right.
Yes I sha I shall have to go and talk to the tax people I know about  er  the the set up.
Yeah.
Right.
Fine.
Er this next form is basically one that we have to  send to the Benefit Office  
Right.
the D S S,
Of course.
the Inland Revenue and  the TEC office.
Right.
I'll suspend this.
You would need to  be in touch with the the Benefit office informing them 
Right yeah.
that you are going  onto the Enterprise Allowance scheme as from Monday .
I I I've got all the necessary papers to do that .
You have.
It's just a question of I was waiting till we'd had 
Right.
this meeting so that it was then 
Yeah, fine 
official
Yeah.
obviously.
Well this goes  by tortuous route and eventually will get to  Newark .
Yeah.
Erm basically we've just got here your your name 
Okay.
Can I  correct the spelling, it's one  .
.
You know when I wro 
It's two  in surnames and one  in christian names I always think.
I must admit on every form I've put the two  and I thought afterward I'd better 
.
It's a minor thing but er  you know.
On some of them I've just put John P I think.
That's right yes well that's how I'm intending to trade .
.
Yes, yeah.
Your national insurance number.
That is correct.
The type of er  business you are setting up  as a music teacher .
Right  music teacher and supplier of musical services in fact, yes.
Erm  trading name?
Is just John P  in fact .
Right.
And the card that I'm going to do will be  have John P  you know  erm teacher, accompanist 
right, yes .
performer  transposer or whatever it's  I don't want to limit myself to just  saying, I'm a teacher  other things as well.
No, fair enough, yes yes yes that's that's very  very .
The address business address is happens to be your home is 
Is correct, yes.
your home address,and the Enterprise Allowance  money will be paid from Monday the twenty fourth of January nineteen ninety 
Right.
thre four right through to Saturday the twenty first of January nineteen ninety five.
Got it, yeah.
The first payment due to you which will be credited to your business bank account will be on  week commencing the seventh of the February.
which will be a fortnight after 
Yeah that's right .
the  the actual start, yes.
I'll change that.
The  they were going to actually pay  fifty pounds  a week for a 
Yeah.
shorter period then on a reducing scale 
 
but the computer can't do it and  so 
 
unfortunately they'd already printed the forms
Yes.
and so but it it's back  .
Oh I understood the eighty pounds a week anyway .
Yep.
Yeah.
Providing that the forms get down to  the computer in London on time
Mhm.
then  erm  the first payment in some occasions is a cheque direct to you from the TEC .
I see.
Then when the cheques stop, then check with your bank further two weeks  
 
go straight to the bank.
Okay.
If there are any queries on   that you haven't erm received the money or anything just get back to us and er we'll 
Okay.
we'll we'll chase it up .
I know where you are.
Yes.
So that form we will send off to the various  erm  departments.
Right.
Right.
This form here it's just a fairly short one,i could you just  tick the appropriate boxes for me.
It's a bit of a market survey  research .
How did I hear about it?
Erm  well I didn't actually  hear about it, I'd already known that sch that such schemes existed .
Right yeah.
And it merely occurred to me, actually I was sitting in the unemployment benefit office and I said to them er er at one of my interviews,
Mm.
Probably I'd be better off going self-employed wouldn't I? and they said, Well in that case you'll need to talk to the Chamber of Commerce  
Right.
so I suppose basically
Yeah.
the job centre .
Mhm.
Is that okay?
Yeah that'll do fine.
Erm  I think I'd have  my business  later, probably about  six months .
Months , six months.
I'm glad you said that cos if too many people said they would have gone on  started business without it they might drop the scheme .
They might drop the scheme, yes yeah.
Mm  ah  I suppose so.
I object to these  things actually on principal .
I I  
I've refused to do them for Notts County Council  on occasions.
I could I could  prefer not to say , couldn't I ?
Yeah you could have done.
Erm   long term health  problems or disability.
yes 
Well 
and no.
retired on health grounds but I 
Well I mean we we are, yes yes we are aware of the .
Right so I will say no I don I don't have a long term one, and no I'm not registered.
for that one.
Thank you.
Right now this next form is the one that we need the bank details.
Which I just happen to have with me  somewhere in here.
I seem to have every form the Inland Revenue has ever published at the moment.
Ah  to the back of the .
In the bank manager's own handwriting.
Ah mm.
I have to sign my life away to get these yellow forms.
Mm.
Secretary of State cos I mean in in the wrong hands their worth  each form's worth two thousand and 
Of course, yes.
eight pounds
Yes.
so this one we have to be very careful with it.
Right the  sort code
The sort code is 
And the account number?
Is  
 
repeats account number.
And the account name is ?
Is John P  
John P.
business account.
Right.
Which account  er bank is it  ?
There you are.
Nat West.
Right.
Okay that's fine.
Erm industry code.
I looked up that early  earlier.
Fifty three.
We have a big directory that we've got to put all these 
Oh I see .
depending what type of business you're in.
Right when erm  did you finish actually work with   .
On the thirty first of August
Thirty first of August.
last year.
Right.
Approximately how many weeks is that?
Erm  hang on.
September, October, November, December  erm we're talking about  sixteen, eighteen  we're talking about twenty  twenty plus weeks  twenty twenty one weeks.
Twenty one weeks, right.
And in that time you were in receipt of benefit were you ?
Yes.
Yes was it er  do you know the the weekly amount approximately?.
Erm forty four  something.
Well whatever it is the standard .
yeah right.
Forty four.
It   to eighty nine pounds twenty twenty something pence  in total.
So it's for just over 
Right.
forty four.
That's  two  two and six .
One  two  two.
Right if you'll just erm  check the details .
.
If you want to just check the bank account cos we don't want the  we don't want the money going to the wrong 
Okay yes that's important .
close your zero there in case it looks like a six .
O one ninety four.
Yes obviously that's the date isn't it O one ninety four?
Yes, yes.
I never never appreciated that before .
No.
Oh I I knew that 
.
one actually because  our other erm  accounts are rather similar..
Right.
business yeah.
I don't know  oh yes
Right.
seventy two ninety four .
Yes that's the date of the first pay first payment 
Yes of course.
Your national insurance number.
Yeah.
Date of birth .
Erm 
You're male.
The industry code  
.
that I've looked up.
Previous unemployed twenty one weeks.
Previous benefit level forty four.
Right.
That's correct.
Signature of applicant.
. And the twentieth 
=ieth 
one  ninety four.
.
Right that's that out of the way.
One  there is a contract  agreement here between you and the  North Buckinghamshire TEC.
Right.
Erm there's nothing very sort of horrendous about it.
If you  just have a  take a few moments to 
.
have a read through it.
The  handout that they refer to here.
Have you read  erm handout number one?
It's  one of these which I think did I give you  initially ?
I have got a copy of  here 
That's it.
Yes.
I've actually been through it as you will appreciate.
A total of my own expense and ticked the appropriate bits  complied with them .
Fine, fine, yes so that actually refers to that 
Yes.
particular  account there.
Right.
In which case I will pause this again.
 
the only erm problem I had I think with the basic er terms as outlined in this document are the fact that I'm going to be wor erm intending to work for fif at least fifty of the fifty two weeks in the year at it when of course erm certainly as we'd already agreed on my erm  business plan  within the summer month from the  the end of July until the beginning of September 
Yes, yes.
it's highly unlikely  I'm gonna get any business at all.
Right, yes .
In any case because of the nature of 
Yes.
what is being offered 
.
and the market  that it's being offered to.
Yeah, yeah.
Er tha that's alright yes.
I mean the bas if you're sort of wanting to take any holiday or time 
Yeah.
off I mean just keep  yes .
That's the time to do it, yes.
Keep us informed and er 
Keep us informed, yes 
tha tha that's okay.
Do you want to know about occasional days or you you're presumably concerned with  with full periods.
I mean it sometimes is that for instance we  we have a daughter in York and I have parents in London 
Yes.
and sometimes we'll take a long weekend 
It's really full periods 
Go Friday to Monday or something 
Yeah.
like that.
It's really if you're sort of gonna be away for a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Anything longer than that erm  it just depends really on the time of the  erm  your  the time of the year or how many months you've 
Right.
actually been on the scheme.
For example, we need  to see you  at 
Is it three six
Er three months and at six months  and then again at sort of the twelve months time 
And then at fif 
We're always still here and available .
and eighteen I think isn't it as well?
Yes that's right.
Yes.
So it's  if it's coming up 
Yeah.
to sort of three months and you 
 
have to be away and we don't hear from you we think, Oh you naughty boy, yes .
You might get worried, yes.
We'll take him off the scheme because he hasn't replied to  any of our correspondence .
Yes.
So er
No I'll certainly keep you informed .
No that's alright, yeah, fine.
Right this is the  the last  form .
This is my copy of the form.
Erm     have you been s yes you've been signing on 
I've been signing on postally in fact .
Yeah, yeah.
And it's been less than  it's between six weeks and  five months has it?
It is  it must be yes.
Erm ooh no hang on  it's just over five months .
.
Right so that's six to twelve months  .
That's six to twelve months wasn't it yes.
I must get my glasses changed.
They must print their 
Yes.
forms on slightly bigger pieces of paper I think.
Right.
Er  do you have any long  term health , no.
No.
Right here you have the opportunities to prefer not to say as to your colour.
Oh go on I've said it once so I'll do it again.
Right.
It's just basically 
Right.
basic details, name  and address, telephone number,
Okay, yeah.
national insurance number, date of birth.
Erm another code number form a directory 
start date of going onto the scheme,
That's today.
the end date  yeah 
 
And  forty pounds 
 
a week and that's erm  the code number for the for the TEC.
Right.
So sign and date that one.
ninety four.
That's it.
That's it, right.
you're now participant number O one six four two.
That's great.
one of those numbers to   .
I'll write it down on here.
O one 
O six  O one six six four two .
six four two .
Right.
Not that I shall probably need it at all.
Right.
Well thank you very much .
So that that's everything.
Now as I say  erm the next formal  sort of contact 
Mhm.
that we will have will you  with you will be in about three months time when 
Right.
we'll  er we'll want to see you.
We normally on the first three months do it on a group basis
Okay.
but if you happen to have erm  an urgent appointment or you're 
Mm.
seeing a client   on that particular morning
Yep.
then  we we can do it on a one to  
How much notice do you tend to give of these?
It's about  a couple of weeks.
Right.
Yeah.
Erm but if  
 
if it happens 
yeah.
you're saying, Well every Wednesday morning or whenever 
Mm.
it is  that I have an appointment 
Mm.
with a  with a er client then  we appreciate the business  comes first .
Mm  it it may it may not be in that nature because the nature of of supply teaching work of course is that 
Yes.
there tends to be a phone call we're desperate .
Can you make it?
Can you make it in half an hour's time, you know .
Yeah, yeah , yeah.
It's a  
should that occur
Yeah.
I mean 
Yeah.
I I think business 
Yeah.
must come first before 
Exactly.
Yeah we apprec we appreciate that 
Erm 
erm.
Now  at that int er we we'll send you a er a couple of forms but als to to complete, but there's also  the main thing that we're really looking f at is  erm  .
How you're keeping 
Yes.
up with that business plan .
That's right.
Filli filling in the actuals 
Right.
of your erm  your cash flow .
Well the the the actual book is already started and is sitting 
Good, good.
up and running as it were and er  I shall be I I know already that some of these figures are inaccurate  
Yes.
having had rather a nasty shock when I had the car serviced the other day .
Right, right.
It needed new clutch and new exhaust 
Yes unfortunately right
which didn't help matters.
.
The travelling and motoring expenses for  two hundred and seventy five 
Ooh  the they will be double that.
Double that, yes.
I've just paid three hundred and eighty five over to a certain garage
Yeah.
and that was before we bought the petrol this morning .
Erm  the form that comes out  is different to this but you you can use 
Right.
put it in pencil in this one if you want and we  so we 
Yeah.
can on the day make  a a photocopy that's all.
It's more of a management exercise  to 
Of course.
make sure that people are
Yeah.
controlling their businesses 
Mm.
and their costs  as opposed to actually  erm 
I've actually got a a complete copy of all that 
Right.
anyway having been
you didn did you want the original back 
Erm.
or erm
Yes alright unless 
Yeah.
you wanna keep it.
we have got a copy as well so
Oh I see.
Yes.
Well ha ha had I known I would have told you  not to take a copy you see .
That's alright.
I I I've I've been these these routes before
Yes.
and I never give out  documents that are going to be important without copying them first .
No no exactly.
I mean sometimes people go to great lengths and trouble 
Mm.
in getting a a nice  document together and they   they would  
 
they would like to have it back  and so 
Yes.
we take usually just take a photocopy of everything .
Right.
Have you  got the form  for the  I think  the Inland Revenue?
The tax man and it's a 
Erm  what I 
little green booklet called I R twenty eight.
Ah it's changed colour hasn't it ?
What I have  I R?
Twenty eight.
Twenty eight.
I think it'll be one of those 
Here we are.
I R twenty eight.
Yes it's cha changed colour.
the form is actually sitting in the  centre 
That's it.
which is one of the two  that I've got  because the other one I've got to deal with is the  self-employed  national insurance contributions 
Right.
form as well, of course .
Can I  just take the numbers off those forms?
You can indeed yes.
We have no problem getting  well that's   we have no problems getting 
Yes.
them from the Inland Revenue.
They send us lists 
Right.
of what's in everyone's  .
This this came as part of a package
Right.
I I rang Hill House in Mansfield  
Right.
useful 
how about it.
I have another matter to talk with them actually about my wife's liability to  class to  contributions.
There's a  a long outstanding erm discussion going on between us and Newcastle.
It's been going on for about seventeen months now  and the  in chief man at Hill House was rather interested to hear that we'd not actually had it resolved yet, and asked for the reference numbers and .
Newcastle were on the phone to us within twenty  minutes of him putting his phone down .
Things now seem to be moving.
Good.
to get these from.
You can go dow go down to local benefit office
Mm.
we can get a small  you know quantity but to actually get  
Well thi this is a complete pack that comes and there's obviously  erm from  the  information that was included with it erm  here we are.
Erm they they obviously run a check on what was actually in the pack 
Pack, right.
and whether you asked for anything else.
Yeah, yes.
And does it give an address or ?
I think it was nearly your  your area .
Mm.
office of course 
I haven't seen this new pack you know we 
Mm.
I've had some of the old individual leaflets.
They even give you an envelope for it.
It's very  charitable  
It is really.
.
That's a useful er  you know a useful 
It is.
.
Yeah.
get some   .
It might be an idea to have a supply.
Mm.
Yes  shall  pay another call to our benefit office and say, I want some of those  nice mauve coloured 
I suspect I suspect the local office probably won't because it was they  when I rang them here in Newark and I said, Look I'm about to go self-employed ,
Mm, mm.
Oh we don't keep things like that it's  where do you live?
Southwell.
It's Hill House, Mansfield.
You've gotta apply there .
Lincoln  .
So from Newark it's probably Lincoln 
Yeah.
isn't it?
Yes, yes 
Yeah.
normally that erm   
Southwell Southwell faces Mansfield which rather gets us in the  stick you see because we have to come here for  Benefit Office interviews and things like that but you got to Mansfield 
 
for other things.
That's right, yeah.
But most of the people who come here for interviews goes to Lincoln 
Yeah, yeah.
and er  with my son particularly earlier on in his career  things were going round and round in circles and in the end I had to step in at one point, grab all the papers as they came past as they were and saying,come on.
Cos one office was playing the other office  off against each other.
Yes, yeah yeah.
It was quite amazing.
Fine.
So that's  
I'm looking forward to this.
virtually everything.
Good.
as I say we'll be in touch with you in  in that three months time
Right.
but if in any reason you know you wanted to come and have a discussion or there was a problem or 
 
er there's anything  
things are looking clearer now than they did  you know a few weeks ago.
Yeah.
Fine, great.
And so I think  
I'm looking forward to .
possibilities are  are definitely there.
Mm.
I can start advertising myself now  
Right, right certainly.
and I'm hoping that the local authority will start coming across with  a bit of work for me.
Good.
How long did the interview last at the TEC.
Was it a fair was it an in and out  quickly or ?
Erm  fifteen minutes.
Fifteen minutes, right yes .
Yes.
Most of which  time we talked about organs.
I can play you the  er  recording of the interview 
Right.
if you like.
It's on the front of this tape .
But, no I'd better not had I.
No, no.
Confidentiality.
Yes.
That's er
Yes alright .
Yes a very nice gentleman.
Yes  it was John ?
John  yes.
Right, yes, yes.
They they do occasionally change  them around 
Yeah.
Erm  and some people that we  we send out sort of tend to be there for either half an hour and others  sort of.
It possibly depends on the nature of what you're  intending 
Yes.
to set up.
I mean my application essentially I should think was one of the simplest 
Yes.
that could possibly be.
There's no stuck  movements and 
Mm.
things like that involved.
No I mean  we do send the business plan up prior to the  to the  
Of course, yes .
but even so I think some 
Yeah.
of the ones   , yes, yes 
They look at it when the client comes in 
rather than.
I mean we did have 
Yes.
one which  must have been probably about so thick
Right.
and I can't foresee the chap  reading that in a 
No.
and absorbing it and er   they just  want to make sure 
Mm.
that the person there is  er
Actually did write the plan
Yes.
and knows what they're about, yes .
But even but even in that case we did have  er did have a case  with a young  a youngish lad who his accountant had written it
Oh.
was very sketchy
Yes.
financial projection side was fine you know 
Right.
full of  cash flow charts and budgets for three years, projected profit and loss and all .
But the written part was only very sketchy  
Mm.
on on erm  one  side of A four  and it was obviously wasn't written by a young  man
Right.
and erm  the they di did pass him but
Oh.
they did obviously have to ask him a lot more questions
Yes.
so hence the interview 
Yes.
lasted quite  a period of time because they wanted to make sure that  he knew what he was doing and everything 
Right.
was  you know factual within the  in the written part.
I I must say I've also been  er you know very  very impressed and er learnt quite a lot just attending these  courses that you've you've got running here .
Yes, yes.
It helps to put things that you already knew back in focus
Yes.
and remind you of some of the other things that you didn't.
Mm, mm.
Yes so i i at one time to get onto the  to apply for the Enterprise 
Mm.
Allowance Scheme one had to  attend a mandatory seven day Start Your Own Business course.
Right.
Yes I realized this  .
 
This was when they first started wasn't it ?
That's right which was  run two days a week for over  for three and a half weeks.
Right.
Then produce a business plan and the interv go for the interview which   looking  sort of month six weeks 
Yes.
before you could actually get onto the scheme.
But here in Newark because we don't have sufficient numbers coming through
No.
we tend to do it all on a one to one basis
Right.
and have a back up of the  you know the the individual days sort of 
then in a position
Yes.
to use your judgement as to whether you say to somebody, Yeah you must finish this before I'm gonna consider you or 
Yes.
Yeah okay we'll put your name forward but it would be nice if you attended.
Mm.
But before it was a mandatory seven day course regardless of that person's expertise or   you know  qualifications .
might have been  their own company  life before they 
Yes, exactly.
went unemployed and then decided to take advantage.
Yeah I mean we do get people who come in on the sort of the Friday morning and they've already got their  done their business  perhaps sought out  professional advice elsewhere 
Yeah.
they just really need a d discussion with somebody local, get some a bit of extra information  
And sign on.
but to make that person go through a  a seven day course and wait a month 
 
is  nonsense so  it is a much more flexible now.
Because we don't have the sufficient numbers and can't keep people waiting for  courses we tend to have these  do it on a one to one basis  which  you get, I don't know .
I think from  generally from courses are quite good because you do learn something and you're 
Oh yes.
meeting other people in similar circumstances and no matter how much you tend to know, you'll  learn and feed off each other 
Mm.
Whereas one to one it's just  you and that particular  you know business  .
I've been most appreciative of the  erm clarity and incisiveness of  's   set out .
She's very .
She she's a born teacher.
Mm.
Should should  I think the  the the tax  erm   priv private private tax  advice gain is the is the education  with her .
Mm, mm.
She she's absolutely excellent.
Yes, yes.
