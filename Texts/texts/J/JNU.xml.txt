We've got a hearing coming up on the sixteenth of July in 
Yeah.
in Norwich or wherever it is.
Erm  we've  sent all the paperworks  down to er an agent there and we've still not heard from the other solicitors as to what this  erm 
Mm.
thing is  but I'm pretty sure I can identify it 
Yeah.
from the stuff that's now been introduced to us.
Cos there is there appears to have been a display kitchen at some stage.
So I gathered after Mr and Mrs  were .
Yeah.
Erm  just track the letter down where he said that.
between February and March nineteen ninety.
Two five eight nine seven two in which  exactly er the amount that was 
Yeah.
.
Now I can't identify what these numbers mean but I think it relates to
Mm.
erm a display kitchen.
It it says  display account .
Yeah.
Erm  creative cuisine, kitchen-wise .
But i this was actually addressed to erm the Mansfield address.
Yeah.
So maybe that's why  it's not come to light before.
Erm  I presume that  the  s are right in saying that this this relates to the display account at at Newark .
Mhm.
Yeah.
I mean I dunno whether you whether you you may want to  
Well well I I as I er as both myself and my wife understood it, everything had been paid and then obviously when we got the letter saying we owed this amount of money it didn't come to light till Mr and Mrs  came to see you 
 
and said yeah.
Yeah.
But they  discrepancies on their side as well with credits owed and all.
I mean I had nothing at all to do with t' business except I went in partnership with me wife and that.
Right.
So er obviously I didn't know anything about the money owed  or we would've endeavoured to pay it off straight away when we went to the bank er originally when it went  when it folded.
Right.
Erm  there's two points really.
First of all you've got to be satisfied that that actually relates to the unit that was at at Newark.
Mm.
And as I say the curiosity is that it it was actually addressed to Mansfield.
Erm I don't represent Mr and Mrs  as you know, although they've been in to give us a witness statement.
Mm.
Erm you're fairly  Are you're fairly confident that they're  not telling us a porky about this?
Well I honestly don't know.
We've had erm  I wouldn't say a fall out but er we're on frosty terms to say the least.
Right.
This is doing me no good at all whereas it seems to be all me and my wife it's  but like we went to court, Mr  and Mrs  who were equally involved in it
Sure.
are not, you know, haven't been petitioned or anything.
Don't worry, I've told the solicitors that are appearing for us on the sixteenth of July that that's the situation, that the  have not joined in all of the partners  
Mm.
joined in too and that they they really ought to be invited to put the  s in the frame as well.
Erm  so I think this hearing on the sixteenth of July will be quite useful in trying to be able to i identify that this display unit relates to Newark and not to Mansfield.
Yeah.
Assuming for the moment that is right then obviously that sum is is outstanding
Yeah.
er and to avoid racking up costs which is a thing that worries me 
That that's what I come to see ya yeah.
erm I think that some sort of offer ought to be made.
Now we we've got these suggestions that you have problems with late the later deliveries from  
Mm.
which created  inconvenience at the least and expense in you having to buy units from elsewhere   customs.
Er if we're doing the job properly as I said to you before we really need the invoices for various 
Mm.
customers and how much it's actually cost you to put the jobs right.
Erm  but taking a very broad approach to it it may be that we can suggest to the receivers of  that  erm  taking the inconvenience, the extra cost and so on, roughly say half of that account erm 
Mm.
can be wiped out.
Er and and just going through my mind at the moment  
Is that like settling out of court cos that's  
On yes 
I would settle for that.
Oh yes.
As you know I mean I'm  only a working man
Yeah.
wi not an extortionate amount of wages and  we've just had this  two hundred pound for the to be transferred to Mansfield.
Sorry what's that?
Erm  well I bought in two hundred pound on account for my cost to you and then 
Oh yes I'm sorry, yeah that's right 
Had a letter 
Yeah 
this weekend
for another two hundred pound for  if I get it right is it to fetch it over to Mansfield or their
newsagents over in Norwich and 
Yeah yeah 
obviously you don't want to pay us to travel over there 
No
So erm I'm  just throwing this out as an idea that we perhaps we offer one half of this amount here
Yeah.
erm each side to pay its own costs
Yeah.
and we get the  s to pay half of the half.
Yeah.
Well 
 
if worst comes to worst and they don't accept that
Aha.
speaking on my own for my own personal point of view erm if they if  they insist they want this full amount
Yeah.
would it be possible for me to pay my half of that and  the  s pay the other half because I'm not i it it's really started to worry me and concern me a lot
I'm 
now 
I'm sure that's right and  includes a lot of interest as well 
That's right yeah
 

building up every day really.
I mean 
The object 
 
as far as I'm concerned is to try and kill it as quickly 
Yeah.
as we can cos of the cost side  erm  I'm not happy about the way they've drawn up the writ because it doesn't say precisely wh it doesn't say what that invoice says it's only 
No.
because we've done some digging around that we've actually got that information 
Mm.
it doesn't say it it was at Newark  erm and I think you've got reasonable prospects of knocking it back because of the problems you had with  towards the end.
So I think you know erm
we've got no proof they were labelled deliveries or 
 
customers complaints or
Er I mean the interest is one thousand one hundred quid so 
Yeah.
we're talking about three six aren't you at the end of the day that's what they're trying to apply for.
Erm   I'll start on the basis that we offer one two fifty.
Yeah.
What I want to do is clear that with Mr and Mrs  as well pay half of that
Yeah.
I think  
So does that sound okay to you?
It sounds very good yeah  
But you're saying anywhere between those two figures personally you will pay half of the two thousand  five hundred and eighty nine  
Just to finish it off yeah.
I mean if they insist they want all that I mean I'll  if they insist they want the interest as well then I'm in er a bit of a spot  
Yeah.
Okay leave it with me.
I'll er telephone them possibly
I'll telephone them tomorrow and see whether we can sort something out.
Thanks a lot them Mr .
Okay I'll be in touch .
I feel a little bit better at least.
Yeah.
Thank you anyway.
Alright.
Cheerio then .
Ta-ta.
Er shall I pop in tomorrow with the two hundred pound for Norwich then?
Er yes if you wouldn't mind.
Okay then.
It may be that we don't have to use all of that.
Obviously you'll get a refund if I can solve 
Yeah.
this fairly quickly.
Okay then Mr .
Thanks a lot.
Alright.
Cheerio.
Bye.
