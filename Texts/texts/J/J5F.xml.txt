Thank God Someone's Making Waves
Dear Friend and Supporter Welcome to Greenpeace.
By joining us you have become part of an international movement which is dedicated to protecting the natural world and which is committed to act in its defence.
There is no doubt that Greenpeace direct actions have changed the face of environmentalism and the meaning of conservation over the past few years.
What was once a polite lament over lost species and habitats has become an outcry, a powerful force which both national and international authorities can no longer ignore.
Greenpeace has come to epitomise the struggle for a safer future, not just for humankind, but for the planet as a whole.
We welcome you particularly because we hope in the years to come your personal commitment to protecting our planet will deepen, as has ours.
We also hope you will follow our campaigns in your quarterly newsletter and that you will find the time to study our in-depth campaign reports as they become available.
In this way we trust that your appreciation of the need to support our work will grow.
I have sent you a broadsheet which surveys our campaigns.
You may be surprised by the success our direct actions have achieved so far.
I have also sent you a catalogue of Greenpeace merchandise so that you may choose from it, and may I draw special attention to the Greenpeace enamel dove badge which we would particularly like you, as a new supporter, to purchase and wear.
Finally, I hope that over the coming years, with your support, Greenpeace will campaign even more effectively to protect the natural world and fully justify your decision to join us.
Welcome again, Yours sincerely P.S. Your supporter's reference number will appear on the address label of our next mailing to you.
Please keep a note of it and quote it if you write to us.
Thank you.
