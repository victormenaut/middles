Hi, join us after the news for Scotsport Extra Time.
Support is growing to make Joe Jordan the next manager of Scotland, Lou Macari, the man in the frame for the Celtic job joins us live, and Spurs have given Rangers first refusal on a transfer-listed player — guess who?
All that plus the Premier League stars still harbouring World Cup dreams on Scotsport Extra Time, tonight, ten thirty.
But first tonight, news that support is growing for the notion of having Joe Jordan as the next Scotland manager.
Gerry, what's the state of play?

League Cup finalists Hibernian are holding a two point lead at the end of the first quarter of Premier Division matches, ahead of Aberdeen, Kilmarnock and Motherwell.
Tomorrow Hibs take on Celtic while the Dons visit Rugby Park and Motherwell meet bottom-of-the-table Dundee.
Hibernian's rise to the top has co-incided with a return to form for Darren Jackson, but its not all good news for the striker.

MOTHERWELL V HIBS/Last Saturday; 2:22
The First Division sees Clydebank and Airdrie still together at the top, with Dunfermline starting to make a charge, they've climbed to fourth place.
Clydebank are at home to Hamilton tomorrow, and Airdrie away to Clyde.
And there remains a two-way tie at the top of the Second Division, Queen of the South and Meadowbank Thistle up there after their draw last week.
They are both away tomorrow, Meadowbank at Albion Rovers and Queen of the South at Cowdenbeath.
We'll take a break there, in a couple of minutes, the dream may be dented, but Pat Bonner's still looking for a World Cup place in the States next summer.
Hello again.
Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner was relishing the chance to officially qualify for the World Cup finals in front of a home crowd in Dublin this week.
The city was bracing itself for a party to beat them all, but the Spaniards decided to re-write the script.
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND V SPAIN/WEDNESDAY;
PAT BONNER/CELTIC and REPUBLIC OF IRELAND;
JACK CHARLTON/MANAGER, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND;
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND V RUMANIA/1990 WORLD CUP;
And the final match is on Wednesday, November the seventeenth, Northern Ireland against the Republic at Windsor Park.
If the Republic win, they'll go through.
England virtually kissed goodbye to the finals when they lost this week in Holland.
It was a result that delighted Rangers winger Pieter Huistra, who now harbours hopes of a World Cup place for himself.
PIETER HUISTRA/RANGERS;
Scotland's defeat in Italy was certainly not unexpected — tonight, as we've heard, Joe Jordan is being touted as the next Scotland manager.
But it's likely that Craig Brown will see out the World Cup qualifying series.
Ken McRobb rounds up the rest of the World Cup news.
POLAND V NORWAY;
FRANCE V ISRAEL;
Newmarket is the place to be for racegoers tomorrow, where the Tote Cesarewitch and the Dubai Champion Stakes worth a combined total of two hundred and twenty five thousand pounds are being run.
Here's John McCririck.

DEWHURST STAKES AT 16 SECONDS.
That's it for tonight,
Scotsport is back on Sunday at four thirty, and as ever, you can air your views on our phone line, 041-332-8787.
And on Monday at ten forty, there's a Sport in Question special, hosted by Ian St John on the state of British football in the wake of a disappointing week on the World Cup front.
Scotland may be out, but Hampden's looking fit to grace the best of games, as you're about to see.
From Gerry and myself, goodnight.

Good afternoon, Celtic say that Lou Macari is expected in Scotland tomorrow to finalise the deal that will confirm him as their new manager.
Talks have been going on since last night and the former Celtic and Manchester United star is set to travel north to sort out the details of his contract.
Paul Cooney's been following the day's developments.
PAUL COONEY
The stumbling block has been Stoke City's half a million pounds compensation demand which the Parkhead club have refused to meet.
Celtic's offer of around eighty thousand pounds stands and Macari is now considering a package to take him from Stoke City where he's a firm favourite with the fans after leading them into the English First Division.
Meanwhile,
Scotland's European hopes, Aberdeen and Celtic, have started their preparations for the midweek matches with two of the continent's most famous names.
The Dons travel to the magnificent World Cup stadium in Turin for the Cup Winners Cup clash with Torino, while Celtic are at home to the side at the top of the Portugese league, Sporting Lisbon.
Just two points separate the top five clubs in the Premier league with leaders Hibs emerging with no major fitness worries from yesterday's match as they turn their attention to next Sunday's league Cup final with Rangers.
Over at Ibrox, the news for their fans is that the long injury list is continuing to shorten.
Now to Rugby Park, where Kilmarnock, after a superb start to the season, had the chance to go within one game of their previous best Premier League run of ten matches undefeated.
(George McCluskey had to settle for a place on the bench, which opened the door for Tom Brown, who just a few months ago was playing Junior football with Glenafton.
After three consecutive games without a win Aberdeen boss Willie Miller brought back Gary Smith, Lee Richardson and Brian Grant, with Grant making his first appearance since the opening day of the season.
The referee was Eric Martindale from Glasgow.
Our commentator, as usual, Gerry McNee.)
We'll take more of your calls later, but coming up in a couple of minutes all the top action from the Scottish League.
Hello again.
As the Lou Macari saga moves into its second week, Celtic had the task yesterday of facing league leaders Hibs under caretaker manager Frank Connor.
Ken McRobb begins our exclusive coverage of the Scottish League, at Easter Road.
That's all for today.
We're back a week on Friday here on Scottish with Scotsport Extra Time, at ten-thirty, and
Scotsport's back two weeks today, with exclusive Scottish League football at four-thirty, plus your chance to be on the programme with your views or questions by phoning 041-332-8787.
So, from Gerry, Gordon and myself — goodbye.
Lou Macari took charge of his first Celtic training session this afternoon at Seamill in preparation for the Old Firm clash at Ibrox tomorrow.
After all the speculation surrounding his appointment, he can't wait to see his new side in action.
LOU MACARI/MANAGER, CELTIC;
League Cup success couldn't have come at a better time for Rangers, nor for that matter could the return to goalscoring form of Ally McCoist.
Tomorrow he's out to make Lou Macari's return to Celtic an unhappy one.
ALLY McCOIST, RANGERS
We'll take a break there, still to come tonight, Roy Keane on Manchester United's chances of staying in the European Cup, and in a couple of minutes, we concentrate on the Edinburgh derby.
Hello again.
Aberdeen took advantage of Hibs not having a league fixture last week, and they did it in style, this spectacular overhead kick from Duncan Shearer clinching a two-nil victory over Dundee United at Pittodrie, which took the Dons to joint top spot in the Premier table, although Hibs now have a game in hand.
Motherwell are third, a point off the leaders with Rangers and Kilmarnock together on fourteen points.
There are tomorrow's fixtures, Aberdeen — Dundee, Dundee United — St Johnstone, Hibs — Hearts, Motherwell — Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle — Raith Rovers and Rangers — Celtic.
League leaders Hibs have to pick themselves up from their League Cup final defeat at the hands of Rangers when they meet Hearts in the Edinburgh derby at Easter Road tomorrow.
They reckon it's no bad thing to be going from one big game to another.

Airdrie and Falkirk clashed in the First Division's match of the day last Saturday, the home side going ahead through a scrambled goal by Andy Smith in the twenty sixth minute, and it looked like that was going to be enough for two points.
But Falkirk fought back, and were rewarded with four minutes to go, when Neil Duffy pounced on a loose ball in the box to beat John Martin and rescue a point.
But with Clydebank losing to Morton, Airdrie have moved a point clear at the top of the table with Falkirk occupying third spot.
Clydebank are the only side in the top three at home tomorrow, they meet Dumbarton, while Airdrie are at Hamilton and Falkirk travel to Stirling Albion.
Stranraer have a one point lead in the Second Division with Meadowbank, Alloa and Stenhousemuir sharing second place.
Stranraer are away to East Stirling tomorrow, with Meadowbank playing Stenhousemuir and Alloa facing Queen's Park.
The third round of the Coca Cola Cup dominated proceedings in England this week.
Coming up, a hat-trick for Liverpool's Ian Rush against Ipswich, but first, Manchester United in great goalscoring form against Leicester.

We've just seen Manchester United blast five goals past Leicester City, and it's that sort of form they'll need next Wednesday if they are to stay in the European Cup.
They meet the Turkish champions Galatasary having drawn three-all in the first leg of their second round tie at Old Trafford.

Good afternoon…a sensational hour of football coming up featuring that incredible Old Firm match at Ibrox and all the goals from the rest of the Premier derbies.
But first, work's been going on throughout the day to clear-up the Broomloan Stand at Ibrox which was damaged at the end of the big match last night.
Paul Cooney's been following the story.
Rangers will announce tomorrow what action, if any, they'll take following the vandalism in the Broomloan Stand.
PAUL COONEY
Not for the first time, seats were wrecked at the showpiece stadium and maintenance men have spent the day at Ibrox assessing the full extent of the damage at the Celtic end of the ground.
Rangers were reluctant to talk about the incident today — they say there has been vandalism but they'll wait until the morning to consider their next step.
Aberdeen's European opponents Torino were playing in Serie A against Cagliari this afternoon before flying to Scotland for Wednesday's Cup Winners Cup tie at Pittodrie.
Sporting Lisbon, who play Celtic in the UEFA Cup in midweek, suffered their first defeat of the season last night, beaten two one by Boavista.
We'll take a break there.
In a couple of minutes, we've our exclusive coverage from the rest of the Premier Division, plus seven goals from the Stirling-Falkirk derby.
Hello again.
For the first time in years, Hearts began their derby match against Hibs as underdogs, but, as Ken McRobb reports, the jinx over the Easter Road team shows no sign of disappearing.
Now to this week's competition, and for that we've the ideal garment for winter sports fans.
We've five top-grade Pinnacle thermal jackets made by Snowgoose of Stirling to give away.
And they're each worth a hundred pounds.
So this week's question is:
How many clubs will be relegated from the Scottish Premier Division at the end of this season?
Is it
A)
One
B)
Two or
C)
Three.
Once you've decided, the number to ring is 0839 treble four five-double-one, and please include your chest size with your answer.
We'll announce the winners next Sunday.
That's all for today.
We're back on Friday, here on Scottish, with Scotsport Extra Time, at ten-thirty.
Scotsport's back next Sunday with the best football action from the Scottish League, plus your chance to be heard on the programme by phoning 041-332-8787.
So, from Gerry, Gordon and myself, goodbye.
