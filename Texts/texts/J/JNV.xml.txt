I am in fact a self-employed business advisor, management consultant 
Mm.
call me what you will.
Under contract  TEC come here usually one day a week to  carry out these interviews  erm they poke me in any corner they can find.
Yes.
Erm  I started my business some nine years ago when I was unemployed under the  Enterprise Allowance Scheme.
Very much a rubber stamp exercise in those days and as a result of that only one in four of the businesses that were supported was actually surviving at the end of the first twelve months.
Mm.
So when the Training and Enterprise Councils were given responsibility for a new stream of scheme they said quite rightly I think that  they would only support survivable businesses.
They  wanted to ensure that people  sufficient skill and training to run their own business and that they'd done their homework.
That policy appears to be paying off  in as much  the national survey run at the beginning of last year showed some seventy two percent of businesses were still there after eighteen months.
And locally we carried out a similar exercise some six months ago which showed that eighty two percent of the businesses were still there after  months.
Still there, but not necessarily making a profit.
Right.
Okay?
Yes.
Right, you seem to be pretty well qualified.
I hope so  yes  erm
What made you  give up education?
Erm quite frankly I erm  pulled out because of stress.
Right.
It was a doctor's instruction basically.
He  I I'd been to them over a  a period of about two years  erm with all sorts o of different problems and in the end he said, You know I can increase your drugs but that won't help.
Mm.
I know how to sort your problem.
It's to remove you from the source of this, and that is the school you're working in.
Right.
So I took his advice and left.
And you  are actually qualified to teach the organ?
Organ, piano  erm harmony, theory anything to do with music basically.
I mean  did you progress to the organ through the piano or?
Erm  yes and no.
It's something that I worked on  er  independently as it were.
My father who was a er a clergyman taught me the piano from an early age  and er I first became interested in the organ purely for money  purposes  in fact , when at the age of fifteen a local methodist church in Durham where we lived at the time said er, We need an organist.
We've heard you playing the piano for the local Sunday school  erm we'll pay you sixty pounds a year, which in nineteen fifty whatever it was a lot of money, provided you spend half of that having organ lessons.
And I duly accept their off accepted their offer.
Right.
from that.
Erm we pay our church organist I think twelve pounds a year.
Yes   it it varies from one  to another I think.
Mm.
The Royal College of Organists wouldn't be pleased to hear   .
And you have you own organ do you?
Or 
No I've go I've got access to several in   
Right.
A cathedral organ or 
Yes yeah.
Do you play in the cathedral yourself or ?
I have done in the past, not recently.
There have been other things occupying  me recently .
Right.
Yeah.
And  do you find  I mean you mention somewhere in here that  you have  one or two potential clients.
That's right.
Are any of those for the organ?
One is yes.
He's got his own organ at home erm 
Mm.
erm but essentially now I've discussed with him, as I mentioned in my  er plan, er the intention is to meet anybody who wants musical services and find out from them precisely what er they really need.
He doesn't need organ lessons and I've advised him as such and he's accepted that.
What he was particularly interested in is he's been taught the Yamaha method in fact 
Right  .
where his right hand, he's a very confident music reader and plays but his left hand  he's merely sort of hangs there like a claw and plays the odd chord
Mm.
and he wants the same facility with his left as with his right.
So I am proposing with him to  er undertake a fairly simple but comprehensive business of reading the bass clef, using the left hand, and introducing it into the kind of music that he already plays, and at the same time getting him to play other music  as well, which he seems to be very happy  .
Right.
Erm  organs are  classified by the number of stops they have or something, isn't it?
Erm not necessarily no but er yes that that is partly important in that if it's not there you can't use it .
Mm.
I mean  how do they  I'm just trying to remember because I  remember 
Yeah.
having  a session with an organ builder right ?
Right.
And he was talking about one two three four stops.
Have I got the right term?
Yes oh yes yes.
 
A stop a stop is a misnomer because it's in fact a starter.
Right.
When you draw it you allow   to enter that rank of pipes  .
But what  okay some organs have one or two keyboards 
Two keyboards yes.
Some have four
Right.
that I've seen.
I mean  how do they categorize that?
Does that relate to stops or what?
No each each division is a separate  erm section of the organ in fact 
Right.
erm and in the traditional er properly made organ as it were, the pipe organ, erm each keyboard  er is available to you to play from.
Each keyboard has its own ranks of pipes and each sound, each rank of pipes is controlled by one stop
Right.
so that for instance you can have four stops on one keyboard, three on another  and the three  sounds that are available on this keyboard are available from those, the four sounds that are available  
Okay.
Plus the feet pedals?
Plus the pedals.
And you can then also couple  between keyboards so that if you want to you can play  the  sounds from this keyboard on the lower one by coupling the two together and making them work  as a pair, but that removes the inde independency of being able to set one against the other.
You make an interesting comment about your wife's experiences that ones ends up with a private practice.
What does she do?
She's a piano teacher.
Oh right.
Yes.
Okay.
Works from home.
So she can give you  her overspill work.
Well  yes  yes .
Okay.
Alright.
In  in fact one of my  one of the pupils I am proposing to work with he's one of her  people who have contacted her and she's  she's quite deliberately limiting the number of  her  days in the week she teaches to two.
We have a son who still lives at home who in fact has been quite ill for a long time and  erm  she you know  the amount the work she has done therefore has been seriously limited.
She's definitely erm  reduced it to  two days a week.
Okay okay.
Er you will I think have one problem  er in working for the L E A. Erm I happen to be a school aid inspector and I'm finding now  quite a  with er with the income tax people at the moment 
Mm.
because I'm self-employed  and you're intending to be self- employed which means you're
That's right.
taxed under schedule er  D 
D 
and I have just done some work for  Derbyshire and they have deducted  twe tax at twenty five per cent and  for my invoice.
Erm and the difficulty is proving to some of the L E As that you're actually self-employed.
So you're gonna have to  if you do any work for L E As 
Yes.
set that up right at the beginning which means going to the Inland Revenue 
To the Inland Revenue yes.
and in our my case  give a zero  or or an infinite, I'm not sure which way round they'd do it  erm tax coding which I find 
Mm.
annoying cos I sort of flared up with them and said, Well quote me the law, and they can't quote you the law I mean they  it's just someone who they seem to be  we do it .
conniving.
Yes.
Well they're creating law I think .
Mm.
Yes.
another issue.
Now I've been told by other people who've er  erm gone down this route that I'm proposing to follow with L E As  that erm  there are two ways round it.
Either you've got to do what you're suggesting, go in right at the start and say, It's all sorted, here's the coding, this is what you will apply, the Inland Revenue have agreed it already, you  you know don't use your own system.
Or you accept precisely what they do and claim it back at the end of the year.
Well you hope you claim it back at the end of the year .
Well you hope you claim it back.
But you haven't got the use of that money in that , the government has .
No of course, yes, yes.
Right.
On principal I don't  like that idea .
Now what are you going to do, I mean  you you've listed out here your marketing approach.
Yeah.
Erm  how much do you think you'll need to do that?
Well quite an amount of it has been done already.
Erm the the  talking about  the the idea with various er colleagues and contacts within the Southwell area obviously continues.
It works on a continuing basis.
I was talking with a  erm  a  well she's not a colleague actually she's another piano teacher, only about two days ago while walking dogs, she's walking hers, I'm walking mine, and, Oh I see from your recent advert in the local paper you're accepting piano pupils.
Yes erm 
Ah I don I don't want to you've advertised.
Yes.
No well erm  this was a form of market research.
Right okay.
It was try trying the waters  and er I merely, you know pla place placed a reference there saying erm, Was it possible?
And er she said, I I have occasional requests, I'm full at the moment, erm would you mind if I passed some of my  enquiries on to you as and when they occur.
perfectly alright, thank you very much.
those contacts exist  erm  I ant anticipate publicity in communicating with local schools and other institutions and things like that and there after merely maintaining some kind of a  a a regular  advertisement slot in the local paper  that says, Yes I'm still here, because  people forget .
Erm perhaps operating a mail shot at the beginning of the academic year with the er  er appropriate educational and other institutions.
It's be the best system for this kind of thing .
My wife's never ever advertised in fact.
Mm.
People just got to know about her.
Okay.
In fact as far as local  education establishments are concerned, I've already had two enquiries from  direct enquiries from schools saying, Are you available?
I'm not available yet  erm because I retired under erm health on health grounds.
The authority refuses or did refuse to  consider me as a supply teacher in nay capacity until six months had passed.
This was a ruling the Medical Officer  er instituted.
But er because I've had requests I've approached them and said, Well  we'll get your documents released and see  see if we can speed matters up because  use your experience .
happens , what about the public schools around?
Public schools, there are only three or four fairly close.
I've written to them all.
Erm I've not had any replies  from any of them .
Erm  but I intend to er contact them again and say to them, Well you know I'm still here and should you  hit problems or find that you've just lost one of your  erm staff who were providing the kind of services that I do, don't forget that I'm still here.
Okay.
 Alrighty erm  I'll put it through as approved.
Erm  a letter will  go from the powers that be here  er later today I should think.
It certainly should get out today.
Erm  back to Newark Enterprise to tell them you've been accepted .
Right.
The Business Plan will go back with the letter to them.
I'll tell you why in a moment.
Give them a ring on Friday to see  er that they've got the letter.
If they have then organize a date and time mutually acceptable with them to go in and sign on.
When you go to sign on you will need to take with you evidence of having opened up a business bank account  .
.
The Business Plan goes back with the letter because they  will  require a copy of the business plan so that they when they see you at three, six, twelve and eighteen months 
Right.
they can compare your books and your progress against the Business Plan 
.
and you will also need a copy if you haven't got one   have
complete copy of everything I've given you .
So there's there's no problems.
Right any questions, anything I can do to help you?
Erm  actually I've spoken to Ian  at erm Newark  TEC, and he's already arranged to see me tomorrow afternoon.
Now he  does tend to jump the  .
He's  quick off  quick off the mark.
I shall catch him out one day.


He he he actually suggested that I might like to call and see him this afternoon but I wasn't available  for that so  well 
Yes, yes.
tomorrow it would have to be.
Okay.
Erm  apart from that no, unless you've got any other suggestions from your long experience as being a self-employed person by way of guidance.
Well the only thing I think you will need because you're going to go onto other people's premises and I 
Yeah.
don't know if you've got it in here or not, it doesn't look as if you have, but you will need public liability insurance.
That I'm organizing in that I have now  done a little bit more research.
I've contacted the Musicians' Union and the Incorporated Society of Musicians.
Yeah.
Erm membership of the Incorporated Society of Musicians which comes at about seventy eight pounds a year does actually include public liability 
Yes.
and I am making  I'm in the process at the moment of making application to be accepted by them .
I mean you you might fall over and smash his precious organ or something
Oh this is true yes.
and er if he sues you er well at least you 
Yes.
would be covered for that sort of thing or 
No this this is covered.
with people coming into your house for instruction if they fall over the front door mat
Yeah.
and break a hip or something you know then 
Well that's already covered in fact within our house because we  my wife as a 
Ah  right, yes.
teacher erm our we've already made sure that our own private 
Yes.
insurance does  cover that.
Right.
Which she won't want to know about.
