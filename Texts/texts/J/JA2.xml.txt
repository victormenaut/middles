Interviews on Wednesday twenty sixth of January.
Good discussions with Trevor .
Right Trevor have you got your application form for me ?
I have yes.
I have it there somewhere.
While I'm erm a look at that, I've got some brief notes here from Norman er you were with financial services for some time yeah?
Yes a few years.
Twenty six?
Few years.
Yeah.
Wow what a what a survivor.
.
But erm I understand that er  is it  or ?
Have 
Yes.
made it very difficult for people.
Well it's I got the option to er I got the option to erm take a golden handshake so 
Oh right redundancy  offered yeah.
Well not redundancy it was er what you call severance.
Oh right okay.
It was cos it was change of contract.
You'll see it in there
Okay right.
and er and the the comments of me of me erm of me manager and me assistant manager
Right.
they didn't want me to go naturally.
Mm you're you've made the decision have you?
Er I've made the decision I've gone  I've gone.
Oh you've
Finished finished.
All right.
So now I'm look for another erm job you see .
Opportunity and er there aren't too many around unfortunately in the in the bracket of the fifties.
No I know .
Which I'm in as well.
Erm while I'm having a look at this although it wouldn't seem to me  to be taking too long  to look at this Trevor, what you see on the table over there 
Yes.
is a a selection of product representing all six companies
Right.
that we have.
Where we have erm er advertising consultants.
Yes.
If you'd like to have a a quick look through those while I'm er, please ask any questions while you're looking through, and I'll ask any questions that I'll need to here .
Right okay okay.
Although in this case er since nineteen sixty eight


it erm not very much to ask you about is there?
Not really.
Mm.
You've given a couple of reference here
Yes.
and er you know I I read them fairly straightforward
Yes.
er and you've put them under business references, are they businesses these?
Er no they're they're my mana who I used to who my boss.
Ah right okay.
Okay.
My my er just a minute now this one 
They're not on letter headings and so I just thought they might be 
No no erm they're private okay.
You know they're private really statements cos they don't want the you know they they 
Company used 
they they're not allowed to say for the company.
I mean you can still get a reference off me old company which er you know the  London
Yeah.
Er there's also a solicitor there as well.
Okay.
Some give some don't.
Yes that's right.
But it was from the  but they wouldn't they're not allowed see they're not allowed now see there's another LAUTRO  yeah yeah  
Oh yes  I know .
They're not to write it on letter heading cos it means it says it's coming from the  London.
Yes okay.
London er er in fact the insurance companies are fairly erm rigid on this now.
Some won't just won't 
Yes yes 
give them now.
Well the  London is very rigid.
You know what I mean.
Er
Right.
I mean the fact that you've got them here er
They were they were rigid before the even the LAUTRO came in.
D'ya know what I mean?
Yes.
They were you know 
Now you're not from this part of the country by the sound of it ?
No.
No I've been I've been here a long time like
You down in the Smo from the Smoke somewhere?
Er no no.
I'm er Edmonton London.
Oh that's what I meant.
Edmonton oh yes Smoke is it 
Smoke the Smoke is 
I thought you meant the Midlands or something.
No no no.
The Smoke is another name for London.
Yeah.
Or was in my young young days anyway.
I see here you er say you've done door to door canvassing
Yes.
Er in what aspect in the financial services?
Yes.
When did you er where did you do that up here?
Yes.
Up here yeah.
We had an ongoing er thing you know what I mean that erm er now and again they used to have pushes and we used to out and do a little bit door
Or what we what we call a blitz in some companies .
Yes that's right yeah yeah.
All right.
That entailed door to door canvassing then?
Yes.
How did you feel about that?
Oh I don't mind it I don't  mind it .
I mean there aren't many companies now that would er probably ask you 
No no no.
to do that.
No.
We we er we used to do it like just for door openers really.
Oh okay.
Door openers really cos there's that you know yeah yeah.
I don't mind it.
How do you think erm you're gonna face the er, you gonna get withdrawal symptoms from the financial services?
Not really no no.
No I don't think so no.
Looking forward to a change are you?
Well just yeah 
Mm mm.
yeah.
I thought it was ch you know as a challenge so I thought I would go.
Okay.
Erm you received our corporate brochure and you got a certain amount of information from er from Norman on the phone.
Erm what have you gleaned from the er the brochure?
Well that erm that what it is it's selling erm like to estate agents and that er printing material is that right?
Well exactly what you see there on the.
Well it's not no we don't sell the printed material
Yeah oh I see.
we sell the advertising on the printed material .
Material.
Or we supply the whole of that er those documents you see there.
So you're like a erm like a booklet or something like that that they want to present er for say the clients are you with me?
If they're selling 
Well if you 
a house or
Er yes yes if you take er what you the products you see 
Yep.
down this end here on that table
Yep.
you will see at the top the A four marketing folder
Yeah.
all right?
Hope did you have a look in one of those?
Yes I did yeah.
Okay inside you will see er a number of advertising spaces
Yep that's right.
all right.
Now our advertising consultants sell that space.
Oh I see.
The folder itself is the free gift if you  like  er to the estate 
Yes oh I see 
agent which we provide.
I see.
But the only way we can do that of course is to erm have some form of funding.
Yeah.
Now Norman would have er hopefully explained most that on the phone.
Yeah.
The important thing for me to emphasize to you er Trevor is that we don't make appointments to go and see people to talk about advertising.
Right.
Certainly erm I don't know what Norman says, but I would say on the phone to you, Let's make it absolutely clear that this is er in the main a telesales operation.
Right.
But it's not like the local newspaper and it's not like having a group of young people on a bank of telephones phoning every
Right.
individual er business in sight
Yeah.
Is that is that how it came across to you er through the brochure ?
No no I thought it would be I thought it would be er out there meeting you know companies or whatever
Mhm.
and er trying to market the their their the advertising in the brochure.
Well it certainly is the advertising.
But one of the things that we have discovered over twenty year is the only way you will get people to come into that brochure is to make absolutely certain before you go and see them is to 
Right.
tell them everything.
Right.
Now in financial services that's why I'm homing in er it'll be a dramatic change for you erm what whatever you go to let alone advertising.
Erm er we close on the phone.
Right I see.
In other words er unlike financial services where you have to go and talk to people about their financial
Yeah.
state
Yeah.
financial health check I think one company calls it.
Erm and then may be go away and calculate what er sort of deal they need
Yes.
that it not the case here.
We tell them the price because we know the price almost immediately.
I see.
So erm that certainly is how
I'm used to er I'm not like the  London's a little bit different that other er financial services
In in what respect?
Well that mostly you most people have this impression like that you do the er come away and then go back again.
Right?
I know I know lap stops exists now of course.
Yes that's right.
Well what I mean we we don't do lap tops actually.
Don't do 
What whichever.
But erm never mind.
Er we do the sales sometimes on the first on most cases now on the first er interview.
But that's still face to face you mean?
Yes face to face yeah.
Erm most other companies I know do it on two interviews.
Right yeah.
You know what I mean?
Two interviews you know.
So we we're used 
So you do the close
We're used to doing it up there and then you know.
All right.
There and then.
In fact er double glazing and kitchen people try to close on that first meeting but they 
Yes.
still have to do measurements they can't do it on the phone you see.
That's right yeah.
So whereas most financial services people er that come to us erm would have put down here er as you have, er in answer to our question, Have you qualified sales by telephone?
You've answered yes.
Yes.
What you've done is qualified appointments by telephone.
Whereas we
Not always no not always .
Okay well tell me no tell me please do because
Yeah.
our impression is and that's this is er people like yourself sitting there, is that er you will have qual you know you won't go and see people er unless 
I have to qualify erm you see.
Er you have to keep your costs down
Right yes.
Okay you have to keep your cost down.
Er I've qualified er people over the phone where it's a long distance.
Right.
Okay you know what I mean.
Say if it's Washington here
Yes.
from my place
Yes.
like I er I 
You wouldn't get
I I don't want to run out there just to sit in a house
Right.
Are you with me you know what I mean?
To do 
Oh I I couldn't agree more.
So I have to qualify people sometimes you know over the phone
Right.
that er  
So you so you know the principle I'm talking about there really.
Yes.
Okay.
It still we still find it erm Trevor that er individuals, particularly from financial services 
Yes.
but that also includes double glazing all people who have had to view things
Right.
in front people.
Yeah.
Erm either financially or 
Yeah.
the window size or the kitchen size or the bathroom size, they can't price things out until such times as they've sat down face to face with client .
Oh yeah yeah.
Now we can.
We tell people absolutely everything.
Erm but let's ste let me step back a bit erm because I needed to emphasize that because you've spoken with somebody else
Right.
I wanted to check out what they say
Right.
because what I say on the phone I make it absolutely clear.
A lot of people don't come face to face with me here
No.
on on discussions on the basis of what I tell them on the phone.
So I'm qualifying people on the phone I guess .
That's right yeah.
Anyway let's er let's er talk about what er the purpose of today's discussions, and you notice I don't use the word interview.
No.
Er as far as I'm concerned er it's a self employed position I'm not offering quote a job
Yes.
unquote.
It's a business opportunity.
Er however erm if we get past the three stages that er I'm just talking about here, er we'll be talking about in the minute at least, er then er you'll fully understand what I mean about er you're almost as as employed as you'll ever be as a self employed person.
Because we do guarantee continuity of assignments.
Oh I see.
So nobody sits at home saying, I wonder when my next assignment's coming from .
Oh I see.
You know.
Finish one on a Friday and you'll start a new one on the Monday
Right I see.
or whatever day of the week it is.
Er let's have a look at what we're we're er the meetings here to discuss.
First of all it's erm an opportunity for us to find out a bit more about each other.
Right.
You about the company erm whether it was Joe Bloggs or Rod  sitting here  who represents the company , and and yourself.
Er fairly easy to determine what your background's been for the last  twenty six years  er and I have to say that's quite unusual these nowadays, particularly in financial services.
So you're a survivor Trevor and I admire that in anybody.
But what we're er er
I've been through the changes.
Oh yes of course 
I've been through the changes.
I mean 
It's almost like changing jobs in fact.
It is and I mean it  gonna change again so I thought well this is the opportunity to have a change
Yes.
You know what I mean?
Er I think twenty six years er they made it er they made it, you know.
I mean er I pe I advise people on financial things
Yes.
so I see the opportunity to   financial 
I guess erm with all the contacts you've made over the years you're still gonna have phone calls from people to say er what deal have you got for me this week or whatever?
That's right I have.
Yes.
I've start 
How how are you going to cope with those?
Aye?
How will you cope with those?
Just pass them on to some friend of yours or?
Yeah yeah.
Or still 
I'm already doing that
or still do them in the evening?
No no no.
Right.
You've got to have a licence now.
Oh of course you have .
and you see you're allowed to comment if you haven't got that licence now.
So you've got to be
Okay so it would be illegal for you to erm
Comment.
comment if I asked you for some advice?
Yeah yeah..
So you can't see me is that it?
You must you must only erm advise people on your product.
Oh okay.
Your product.
Right I understand.
Okay first of all er what we need you and I to decide is whether  is a platform for you to continue to earn 
Right yeah yeah.
erm some good money.
And er once we've past that hurdle the other two are fairly easy.
Er and the second one is which company we think, we, you and I think, that you'd feel most comfortable working within .
Right yeah.
Because here we have six companies.
I have the luxury as a recruiter on this occasion to say when when Trevor  walks through the door I can offer him a position er if all things being equal erm in any of those companies.
Right.
But there are certain companies I know that individuals will slot into.
But I always like to hear er you know, what their opinion is.
Right.
The second thing er sorry that was the second thing.
Er which company.
And the third thing is when.
Now erm reading er the back here it looks as though you are available like immediately.
Correct.
And that's what we do on the spot here today.
Er we don't hide behind regret letters.
So in other words you don't go out that door without a decision.
No.
Now that's a bit of a change for a recruiter to have to do that.
Yes I've had one or two upset people go out of the door I must admit.
They haven't  nobody's hit me yet .


But I will know fairly quickly if erm if their background is a bit iffy they have to really sell themselves to me.
How in the last twenty six years do you feel that you've got on with people in general?
In the job you were doing?
Very well.
Very well.
I get on 
What what 
with all ty I get on with all types of people, that's why I think I like you know er I like people.
Okay.
I like people of all sorts.
Right.
I can mix with you know all sorts.
High you know people of high station
Good.
or you know, or wherever.
Have you got any preconceived ideas of people er who may work within those environments you've got there.
Estate agents, medical practices, schools, golf clubs, area health authorities?
Well the only pre precon preconceived idea I have is
Mhm.
erm most of the people that you probably meet will be in business.
So you've got to present yourself on a business level.
Yep.
You know what I mean?
Erm the danger is I think when I first started meeting people, right, you know
Yes.
In doing it.
When I started meeting people, even previous to the job I was in, right? er you tend to get too too friendly and not keep it on a on a business basis like.
Yes.
You've just mentioned, you're absolutely right of course,
Yes.
everybody you meet except for individuals who work for those er types of companies will be business people.
The only people the only er organizations to come into erm the products you see there who are not business people but they are linked, er are charities.
Yes oh I see that yes.
So they would be private individuals doing voluntary work.
But in this financial services field of course in the main were you doing private
No.
finance?
Or or 
No businesses as well.
Businesses.
Yes.
Okay.
A good mix or?
Yes very very good mix yes yes.
Right.
In fact a lot of our you know a lot a lot of the their their the type of business I was in, right? they wanted the erm home service companies but I also branched out because I've always been connected.
You'll see
Company pension schemes?
Yes company pension schemes and all that.
So you have to er put your your presentation properly to those sort of people you know.
Right.
It's you it's no good going along and then saying to your er doing your presentation right when you get there.
Right okay.
You can do that in a private house.
Yes.
But you've got to your homework first.
In in terms of going to a business yeah.
I mean what else what what sort of size pension fund would you have been negotiating with a a business?
Well er what ten ten 
Okay.
So it's the smallest
It's the smallest type of businesses yeah.
Okay.
We haven't really er when it got up to the bigger businesses we used to 
That came out of your hands?
That came out of my hands.
Did you get any credit for that?
Financially?
Er yes.
Little little bit.
Yes.
Not as much
As you thought you should have 
But it it you you got lost off after it goes over twenty.
So when it gets over twenty then you've got to er pass it on to er a erm
What somebody who's 
company pension scheme.
You know.
Okay.
They they can set up a pension er
Right okay.
company pension scheme.
But underneath that it's more 
It's more on an individual basis
Yes.
with the with the business taking the money out each month of their salary or?
Yes.
Okay.
Or free pensions.
All right?
So you can have free pensions.
So you can set up a scheme
Do they still have non-contributory pension schemes around the country ?
Yes yes they still 
Really?
Yes.
Oh.
And the company pays for that.
And of course you can transfer that now can't you?
Yes yes.
There's there's 
Now I lost out when I was
It's changing drastically now and and erm er I mean I've kept up to date with it now
Yes sure.
I'm up to date and I can see it's going to change in the future really.
Yes cos I when I was with B P for six years, a non-contributory pension scheme, I lost every you know 
You would've.
Er
And you can get your money out.
Whereas now it's locked in.
See it's locked in now.
I've got a I've got a thirty two buyout with a company 
Yes that's right.
You'll know what that is of course.
Yes I do yeah.
Good.
Trevor how do you feel about what erm you've heard on the phone from Norman seen in the er brochure seen the products there listened to what erm I have to say about how we qualify people.
Without me going into any other detail what do you think about if you'll fit in?
Yes I'll
You feel confident about it?
Yes I feel confident yes.
Erm because
Telephone and you know.
I'm used to 
Well that's 
I'm used to talking to peo you know talking to people and drawing people out.
Because that's the answer it is.
Well we certainly have to draw them out when when 
Especially over the phone.
trying to tell them that they they must of course need in fact to spend two and a half thousand pound on a full page in a medical practice booklet er for two years, you've gotta be  punchy on the phone  haven't you Trevor?
Yeah.
I experienced the medical practice side, I went out for two or three assignments to to get a feel for it and it's doable.
But it's only doable, I'm afraid that's an Americanism that's crept into our language, doable, erm only if you listen to the people who've been doing it.
And all I what my my parting statement to most people, although I'll say it right now because I've  started it , erm is that if you're prepared to listen to the advice given by the people who've been doing er selling advertising in these environments
Yes.
then you you you're on a winner.
Yes.
If you don't listen if you go back to old traditional styles or the style you are used to
Yeah yeah.
Because you know what they accuse us people in our fifties of not being able to do?
Yes.
Adapting for change.
Adapting for change.
Yes I think that's what they say.
Erm if ever I say if ever get a  fifty year old in front of me  I say, Hey let's prove them wrong.
It's er and I have to listen to people.
I've been in traditional sales.
Good.
Okay Trevor well let's get that that that hurdle out of the way and say you and I agree that  .
Now you er in brief we've had a description.
What environment do you think, trying to read my my mind, which do you think would be a comfortable area for you to be with?
There are two or three in fact.
I like the brochure.
The
I like brochures.
I like 
You mean booklets or the
Yeah these
Okay.
these and those over there.
Okay.
What about up in the corner there there's er Cos what we've launched into in the last er nine months very heavily er
No I don't fancy the schools.
You don't fancy the schools.
No.
Oh right.
What what er as a matter of interest why?
Because it's er you know more or less the same as estate agents in terms of look alike.
Well erm I don't know.
It's probably what you can talk about.
You know what I mean?
Right.
Erm
Well tell me what you think you can talk about or can't talk about in schools.
Well er education I  you know I'm not up on er 
Remem remember no remember what you're doing.
Yes yeah.
Remember.
Remember what you're doing
Yeah
selling advertising space.
Yes that's right yeah yeah .
The only difference between all of those six companies
Yes.
is the environment you work in and the major benefit that you'll be putting over to the
Yeah yeah.
Okay.
So nothing to do with whether you're educated
No no.
All right.
All you're do you're sit sitting in an office, not as luxurious as this necessarily at some time, selling advertising to.
Okay what, let's talk about the medical practice booklets.
What do you think you'll be able to talk about there?
That's one you pointed out right?
Yeah yes.
The medical booklet I mean I would I er I think I believe in that you see.
I think you've got to believe in a product
Okay.
really to or in an area
Right.
to really sort of er I'm not closed.
You know I'm not closed for any area because erm er I adapt I've adapted to change you know.
I've adapted to change cos I wouldn't have  stopped in  in the job I was in.
Oh absolutely yes.
I wouldn't have stopped in the job I was in .
Yes certainly the changes in the financial services arena has have have 
Oh well 
been been numerous haven't they?
To what twenty six year ago it was just nonsensical you know .
Yes.
I mean when I started the job it wasn't the job 
Yes okay.
It was just a mundane job.
Just a mundane job yeah.
But now it's it's highly professional which I've come through the stages 
Almost technical now I think.
Yes yes technical.
And you've got to know what you're talking about if not people will find holes straight away.
Okay.
All right well look I I you've er sort of selected and I I've got no problem with that although schools er I would have thought was ideal for as well as medical.
.
I wouldn't put you in estate agents.
No.
I'd be quite frank with you.
Wouldn't you?
No.
Now now we've been doing this for twenty years and I've got a I've got a feel for


I've I've got a feel for people who go in.
Yes all right okay.
Whereas the medical and schools I wouldn't have thought you'd have any problem with.
All right.
But you have a fee if if you're not happy with going into the schools environment


I might as well suggest one that you would be happy with and that's medical.
Shall we talk about those?
Yes yeah.
Okay what I have is a starter pack
Right.
sorry starter pack, it's an information pack.
If you could draw closer er Trevor I need to show you some papers okay?
Have to get that documentation out the way because I've a habit of of giving things back to people that I'm supposed to keep.
This is for you to take all your you know bumph away.
Now erm once again I'm relying on the information that Norman would have given you in describing how we go about setting the assignments up.
Yeah right.
And it's important for me to clear that side of it on the basis that you have no responsibility for setting the assignments up.
You don't go round the country knocking on doors to get the assignments.
That's our responsibility.
Right.
You literally get a phone call to say er we're coming to the end of this assignment here's your next one.
Right.
All right.
And you just finish one go to another one.
Right.
Did that come across to you er in whatever we said or or done so far ?
No no it didn't.
No.
All right.
So you work on one assignment at a particular time?
Yes you work
You you don't go from er you you're not you haven't got like ongoing assignments three or four at the same time?
No you have we ask you to concentrate on one.
Right.
All right?
So if we if in Crooke where you live
Yeah.
you had er the Crooke surgery
Yes that's right .
You would work on that for two to three weeks and then we may send you to Chester-le-Street
Yes that's right.
er or a surgery in  so
Or Washington hospital?
finish that whenever no no hospitals you don't go anywhere near hospitals.
Do you not?
No
Oh I see
No.
It is purely the medical centre or medical surgery.
Yeah.
Okay?
Now part of the er exercise which the marketing exec does when he or she round to the surgeries is to provide them with a certain amount of information of course.
Yeah.
They sign the contract to take our product for four years.
Right.
All right?
We sell the advertising in the booklet every two years.
Right.
So the advertisers come in for two years.
Right.
Whatever we tell them on the phone is always per annum and we have to be.
There's one contract we sign with the advertiser but it is always er any price you quote is per annum.
Per annum right .
See see how important it is to tell everybody everything
Yes.
on the phone.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh fine.
Okay thank you very much indeed thank you bye.
Still working is it?
Yeah well it's no well that sort of  it is that pho that sort of phone call really have waited.
Never mind.
Fine.
Erm yes it is still working amazingly.
Right so let me make that clear again.
Er we we have we just make sure that everything is told to the prospect on the phone.
Right.
So marketing department have signed them up.
Er they leave them certain pieces of information er like this for instance and it's only er an example.
There is a special one for the medical side.
Right okay.
They leave a list with that the surgery and say please will you compile a list of businesses
Right.
business contacts that you're happy for us to approach.
Right.
Now the important thing about this document is that you'll receive it on the day the first day of your assignment.
Right.
And the temptation is to look at that list and say wonderful I can start phoning prospects that the doctors have already lined up for me.
Mm yeah.
Wrong.
Right yeah.
You sit down with whomever 
Homework sort of 
your contact is
Yeah.
at the surgery.
Remember their contact demands that they provide you with an office desk and telephone facility for three weeks
Right.
while you do the assignment, or at least up to three week.
Yes.
And it's important to get as much information as you possibly can
Right.
about those businesses.
Right yes.
All right.
Because if you just picked up the phone and and er contacted erm a residential home
Yes.
they would say, Well who's this doctor that you what what is this surgery
That's right.
Er it could be that it's just a contact  Hello.
Yep.
Er just a sec just had eleven o'clock as well so.
Okay yep thanks very much bye.
And er so it's important to get information about those interview calls.
Right.
All right?
Now erm
That's the that's erm person who's going to advertise in the actual brochure?
Well these these these businesses are recommendations.
Yeah that's great .
Now if the doctors
So say for instance there the doctors recommended er a newsagent well a newsagent
Well chemist.
They're likely to be medically related in the main.
Well do oh I see.
But it could be the local newsagent where they get all their
Yeah.
doctor medical er documents from er medical journals from.
Yes that's right.
Erm yes.
It is unlikely but I have seen er er one or two advertised in the er but but they will they are unlikely to put that on their list because they wouldn't think about it.
No I see.
They they will prejudge
Yes.
who they think will go in.
I see yeah.
and so will you probably.
Yeah.
And the important thing is to 
Oh yeah well I don't do that.
Well
Don't do that.
what I'm suggesting
don't fall into that category.
even people who've sold advertising space
Yeah yeah.
who've sat opposite me
Yeah.
er would say, Well surely they wouldn't go.
Well I'll show I'll show you this is just a small list of categories of advertisers and you would not even start to think about some of those.
These are for estate agents
Yes that's right yeah.
If I asked if I asked you to compile a list of advertisers of companies and businesses who you think will advertise in a medical practice booklet you may you may list out twenty five.
Yeah.
At the latest count it was at least a hundred and fifty.
Yeah yeah that's right.
Okay?
So anybody 
The market's wide.
anybody is worth go having a go for.
The market's wide.
Yeah.
However, that's a document that will certainly start you er you know start the ball rolling.
Yeah.
When you arrive at the assignment there are a number of documents inside the envelope waiting for you.
We do not send information to your home.
It always goes to the practice manager.
Cos that's another way of telling
Right.
erm the surgery that you're on the way.
Right.
But it does include that document.
There are one or two others but I just bring that along as a.
That tells the surgery and and the staff there exactly why you're there.
Right.
What you're doing.
It might not be obvious to everybody you see.
No that's right.
That keeps them happy that er
Yes and it's another demonstration of the professionalism which we're er rather well known for.
Okay.
Here for you to take away are a couple examples.
Right.
All right.
And I'm just want to draw your attention very quickly and I will emphasize that a lot of the information you're hearing from me are in a brief sense, will be more than adequately covered when 
Yeah.
you get to a training to the training school.
They er there are just three sizes of ads that we have to
Right.
worry about here and there's an example of each each one of them.
Full page.
Full page half and a quarter.
We used to split the quarter into eight but we we it was too fiddly.
Right.
For the amount of er money that er people were going to pay.
And because we've got three sizes we've got in effect three prices.
Which is another thing that you  you know  it makes life easy.
Yeah.
Except that we can on a full page sell up because there are a couple of premium slots like the one you see there inside 
Yeah.
front cover.
Yeah.
If you can home in on the fact that a full page is one thousand pounds per year for two years then it locks in.
Right yeah.
Because if you er start thinking erm three hundred and ninety for a quarter page and move up
Yeah.
then you've lost the opportunity for a full page 
Yeah that's right.
if you can sell that.
Let me just show you a give you
Works the same with the insurance business.
I'm sure it does.
Yeah.
You start at the top 
You'll always 
you always start at the top.
That's tru that's the only part may be of traditional sales that you  
Yeah.
Okay.
It's no good starting at the bottom and going up because then you've lost the the punch haven't you.
Absolutely.
You've lost the punch.
Yes yeah.
You've lo lost all the opportunities to make  yourself  a bit more money which is what we're talking about here.
When our marketing er executive goes round to the surgery one of the one of the things erm he he or she will determine with the with the practice is the number of booklets we're going to print.
Right.
And the way that's determined is er they have to declare the number of patients they have registered.
Right.
All right?
Now if it's a fifteen thousand patient list all right?
Yeah.
that represents in some way erm about three to one.
Yeah.
So we home in on five thousand booklets.
Right.
Right.
Now five thousand booklets internally will create a target of eight thousand pounds for that assignment.
Right I see.
Because that's a large practice.
Fifteen thousand patients.
If you if you look at these scales here
Yeah.
you can see
Yes.
what the relationship between the 
Yes.
and the
Right.
Okay?
Now that target internally is is a figure for us to be working on back at the camp.
Right.
It will be identified on the documentation you receive on your day one.
Right.
However what we don't want er our consultants to get in paranoid about if they don't get that target.
If they don't there is a cutoff point at which we know all our production costs all our er administration costs and all commissions we we will have covered.
Right.
All right?
But only internally do we know that.
You won't  nor would I .
No.
I've been out there and I still didn't know what erm but they will er if if you're struggling on any assignment they will not let you struggle for day in day out.
They will say are you are you sure you've got as much as you possibly can
Yeah.
fine come on out.
That means
Yeah.
that we've probably got enough money f to print.
Yeah that's right.
So that's just for your per your personal pride I suppose is to try and get that because
Yeah.
somebody's put a target for you on it.
Right.
Very achievable in this area.
Yeah.
Now I'd like you to home in in relationship to whatever target you've got there erm you can relate or you needn't, but that five thousand pound is the start point for fifteen percent bonuses.
There's a small one in between but I always home in on that one there.
Right.
If you sell er whatever you sell above five thousand pound advertising sales
Yes.
you will get fifteen percent extra on.
Right.
So if you sold six thousand pounds
Yeah.
right? you would get another fifteen percent on top of your five hundred pounds.
Right.
Whatever you got for that.
Okay?
So you're entitled to bonuses.
They will work out you know they they on on the training course they will show you more examples of that.
I'd like to point out that all erm bonuses are paid at proof stage.
All right?
And I'll explain why in a minute.
Right.
Okay but if you can remember that.
There the prices and you'll see that a full page is a thou well I'll tell you a full page is a thousand pound but we have two premium slots which we charge more for.
That inside front cover costs twelve hundred pound.
Right.
If it was anywhere else in the book other than page two it would cost a thousand.
Right.
Inside front and back cover is twelve hundred pound that's 
Yeah.
inside the back cover.
Yeah.
Page two the next one in from here
Yeah.
is eleven hundred
Right.
and any any other position
Is a thousand.
is a thousand.
I see.
Now
So you think that that's the most prominent er positions 
Oh it oh it is in any magazine
Yeah.
It's the first two and the back .
We have er us humans have a habit of looking where we  
yeah I see.
And it's one of those things.
It it's an acknowledged in in all advertising not just .
Let me er just oh incidentally you're allowed to have ten pou er ten percent on the spot discount if you need it.
Right.
Now if you're if somebody becomes a persistent discounter first of all they'll they'll question it back at head office.
Yeah.
Secondly you'll be creating a bit of inconveniencing to the person who comes back er back in two year's time to resell.
Yeah.
Because they will always want the same price that
Yeah.
er unless you can persuade them of course costs have gone up.
There are a couple of examples of how we make up erm the earnings.
If you sold to the target on a on a revenue there of a two and a half thousand, which is one of the smaller surgeries, we will pay thirty percent on all of that right?
Mm.
So that represents that amount there.
Right.
If there's a small bonus then which in fact pays the petrol for the assignment probably, er providing the Government don't put another twenty P on a  litre or gallon  or whatever.
Erm there's a small one there which will help towards costs.
However it's the bigger one that we we always home in on.
Yeah.
So if you just sold to that at a small surgery that's what your earnings would be.
Right.
And quite honestly that would be achieved in two weeks probably.
We would hope.
If you've got a bigger surgery which may break into that third week
Yea.
then you can see that you'll start earning substantially more.
Yes.
Because of the bonuses.
So after the person's initially contacted the person we go into their surgery right?
Yeah.
And it's up to us to negotiate what the potential amount they want.
No.
To
No it's no no.
All all you have to worry about is selling the advertising.
Right.
Don't think about anything else any other responsibility.
Right okay.
That's done.
You don't negotiate who much that's done by the marketing group.
Right okay.
These these these er targets would be identified on the er on the documents you get
Right.
of your assignment.
Okay?
Yes.
Right.
Now I'll let you take that you can take that away obviously to to study.
That's it right.
We'll pay all those commissions and bonuses
Right.
providing you do one or two small bits of administration for us.
Right.
And we really have kept this down a barest minimum.
Yeah.
Cos we know sales people generally don't like paperwork but I know in financial circles you will have had to have done 
Doesn't mean doesn't  worry me .
No.
Doesn't worry me cos it
No if it's the one thing I know that I don't have to concern myself with as far as financial services is 
.
concerned is the small amount of paperwork all right.
And we have to we always read the small print  as well.
We're always saying to us what's this down here.
All right.
What I why I was emphasizing earlier on how important it is to get all this over on the telephone.
You must if if you're scared if you have any doubts about putting the price of that over the phone then forget doing this.
Because in advertising it'll all be done.
Yeah.
Except when you're negotiating multimillion companies .
D'ya is it is it advisable over the phone then to mention the price first or is it better to go into the to the er to the er
There's a lot of reaction 
description description of what they're gonna put in 
Yeah.
first
Yes.
to get the cement job and then sort of say to the 
Yeah.
Certainly you would er the other aspect you don't even mention your the company's name.
You will only ever say that you are
Yeah.
er working with the Crooke surgery to bring together their their new practice booklet or to erm
Yes that's right.
re resell their new practice booklet.
Erm the doctors who've identified you as as a company they would be very happy to see er supporting this venture and er I've I've I'm cont contacting you with a view of of outlining what we do
Yeah.
it's advertising er it's er de da.
But they'll teach you that on the er
Yes yes that's right.
on the training course or guide you through it on the training course.
The important thing is that there is a lot of preamble because the guy's bound to say erm and even if he doesn't ask you what the price is you must make sure he knows.
Yes yes.
See that's against traditional sales techniques.
In effect.
Yes that's right .
It is really.
Yes yes.
You know if the guy doesn't ask the ask the price fine.
Yeah.
Let's get all the get the sound, now will you buy this and this is the price you can't do it with advertising.
No right.
And I'll show you two or three things on on this contract which will if you presented to them face to face during the during the discussions they would they would use it as an excuse to say, You didn't tell me that I don't want to do it.
Right.
All right?
Right.
And I'll show you
Yeah.
This incidentally is a contract which is the same for all of our companies.
Right okay then.
Unless you're colour blind you can see all the different  colours 
Yeah yes 
there .
That's right yeah.
And in the red is the most important bit is it?
These these will be explained
Yes yes.
in more to you
That's the piece we've got to tell the customer I can see that 
 
I can see that.
All right.
It is  
It reads forms you know we read forms  that way  cos normally
Yeah well they wouldn't be in a different colour if they weren't vital to us .
No that's right.
Yeah.
And and these are the things that they will, one or two of the things, they'll use any excuse under the sun, but these are the things if you don't point them out to them.
Er first of all you will tell them that we want a contract.
Yeah.
You must tell them on the phone after telling them the price and what it's all about you say, Right when I come round tomorr er whenever to er strike up the deal with you I want the contract signed I need a thirty five percent of the first year's payment as a deposit cheque.
Right yes right okay.
Okay?
If you notice the significant of that significance of that figure it covers your commission cos that's what we pay.
Right.
If we we pay thirty percent as you 
Yes.
know for all assignments up to a hundred miles away from home.
Thirty five percent if it's further away.
Right.
All right?
And we we make sure we cover ourselves.
That's why we can pay you all commissions the following week.
Right.
Okay?
You must tell them that the balance of the first year's payment will be taken out through a banker's order.
Right.
Now if you don't tell them that on the phone they'll use the banker's order, ah now you didn't tell me Trevor that I had to sign a banker's order isn't er
Cos some people are frightened er er 
Oh sure yeah 
er er they don't want to do that.
It's a commitment you see.
Yes that's right.
See how important it is?
And the other thing is that the second year's payment is taken out a year's later through the same banker's order.
In fact that's a sales pitch.
Now you don't have to pay for all this up front we take in stages.
Right yeah.
That's
Can can come it can come against your business expenses
Mm or the 
or up against the practice you see.
This is 
Yes yeah they can
this is where they can claim it isn't it you know.
Yes I mean advertising is 
Yes.
claimable you can get your V A T back er 
That's right.
certainly.
We need a signature one signature on unless of course the company says that two people have got to sign it but you have to find that out.
Yes.
If two people have got to sign the cheque two people have got to sign the banker's order.
All 
Mm.
these things unless you tell them
Yeah.
they'll say, Now there's two people on a cheque
Yeah.
oh is the other guy here?
No he's away on holiday for a week or two weeks so that's blown the whole thing.
If you and you you've chased your tail.
Yeah.
It's unlikely that the guy can even come in because he's partner's away for two to three weeks holiday
Yeah.
and your deadline.
See how important it is?
And they will outline on the course a a number of other things of course that they'll blow you out for.
So there are three things we want from er to er for a complete deal.
That's one and then the cheque is one of them.
Right.
The other of course we have to know what they want in the  we want to know what they want in their ad.
Yes.
Now in the main they've all all our advertisers have advertised somewhere.
Either 
Right.
Yellow Pages or some of the local journals or whatever and will have a copy in existence which we can use.
Right.
But once again on the phone you have to tell them that's what you want to discuss when you come round.
Right.
Contract cheque banker's order, have you got any copy mister advertiser, yes fine we will be happy to accept that if it's er suitable for you.
Er
What happens if he says well I want to alter it a little bit?
Okay fine no problem no cost.
So in other words he comes round and he says I I don't want that there I want a little bit put there 
Er telephone number's changed and I want 
Yes.
I want er that I want up there.
Or this is out now I'm not 
That's right.
doing that
Absolutely.
and I'm I'm yeah and I'm I've got a new mob er a new
We can do all this.
Right okay yeah yeah .
We can we can er take photographs.
And you do that on the computer do you?
Yeah that's  
Yes yeah yeah you rearrange it.
Well in fact it's a bit more sophisticated than that.
We can do all anything they want and it's free of charge.
It's all included in the cost of the ad.
Even if there no ad exists, and I've had one or two where there's been no ad
Yeah.
they're advertising for the first time or the last ad 
Or you can have a copy of somebody else's do you?
Er oh we've got thousands to show people if if you need them .
That's what I'm saying yeah yeah.
Certainly you'll have a series 
So if somebody'll say well I like that one for my par particular business you know 
Yes.
with the houses on or something like that yeah 
That's right.
No problem.
Oh no we've got plenty of designs.
Twenty years of doing ads we're be able to have a few.
This space down here, if if the copy exists you just attach it.
Yeah.
It says er I think it says copy attached somewhere.
Yeah that's it.
Copy there.
If nothing er exists we we just tick that box we compose and you'll have notes down here
Right.
They will tell you on the training course how to do that.
If it's copy to come it's a pity because you know that's that's not a complete deal.
Yeah you haven't cemented the er
I never sent any of those in.
No no.
I waited until the end of the week and said well erm you know.
I I would even take I have to say I would even take a erm
An existing one.
an existing one.
Cost otherwise otherwise it's er it messes up your commission thing.
That's that's the things we want er
Right.
Trevor and then if you've got all those bits and pieces together send them in at the end of the week using this commission claim form.
Right.
All right?
Every sales consultant has his or her own unique number.
Right.
So does every assignment.
Yeah.
We just put down the size of the ad the advertiser the practice the town.
What I've just described there a f is a full and complete contract and you tick down there.
Now there are some organizations that  have negotiated with that do not that do not need the banker's order and the cheque.
And that is a typical one BUPA hospitals.
Right.
But there's a list in the training manual which you take away.
You just have to have an official order
So would it be feasible then one two three four five six, would it be feasible that er you'll have had six assignments to have done that week?
Er no.
One assignment six advertisers you mean?
Oh six advertisers I see.
Yeah that's one only you're only con remember you're only doing one assignment.
Right.
Okay?
That's the assignment you're working on
Right.
and those are the six advert this is one of my own commission claim forms .
Yeah that's right.
I had six I had five advertisers go in.
Right.
Those will all be represented by the five complete deals contracts and everything, all right?
Going in different books.
Mm?
No no no one book.
Home in 
Oh I see oh I see.
I see yes.
Yes.
That's only you're only working on one one book at one time.
Erm and erm and then obviously that's something round in the region of what we're looking for.
Right.
I I mentioned earlier on that bonuses are paid at proof stage.
Yes.
All right?
Now that is the next stage at which we get money from the the client.
Right.
Remember we've got the thirty five percent deposit cheque
Yes.
we've got the banker's order
Yeah.
so when the when the proof lands on his desk of his ad for authorization we're taking the balance out
Right.
for the first year.
Yeah.
That's when you can claim your bonuses on that assignment.
Right.
All right?
Every two months a list of assignments which have been proofed completed
Yeah.
that you are entitled to claim bonus on, if you are entitled, will be sent to the sales execs.
Right.
All you have to do is look down for the B numbers, now 
Mm 
that's one of mine from your personal records and you can claim your bonus.
Right.
There are two reasons why we we say it must be claimed.
One they'll never be know precisely the date that they're being proofed
No.
All right?
And secondly a lot of er a number of consultants want to leave their bonuses in to accrue during the year.
Take out 
Oh I see.
in one lump sum.
Right.
It's not forfeited if you don't claim it.
You're you're entitled to claim it as soon as you're entitled to er as soon as it's been proofed.
Right.
But it's up to you.
Yeah.
All right?
So you we won't pay it automatically and if you don't claim it and you've missed it that's I'm afraid hard luck.
Right.
But let me tell you your personal records  will show exactly  how much you're due to have paid.
Right.
Okay?
Right.
Any questions so far?
No no.
You've got it fixed in your mind you're only doing one assignment you know.
Yeah yeah.
These advertisers are just going in one book.
Right right right.
Okay?
Right.
Right you know if you've got any questions now er this is the stage at which we agree on a date for you to start.
No.
No questions.
No questions .
Well certainly my job is to just outline briefly what we do.
Yeah.
Erm when you get to the training course
Yeah.
you'll have a lot more opportunity to see what goes on.
Right.
All right.
And er the trainer on medical practices has been out there for a long long time doing this so there's a lot a wealth of experience there.
Okay well on your application form you said there's no reason why you can't start straight away.
And can I just explain how we go about the course.
Right.
First of all it's fully expensed by us.
We pay your expenses
Right.
there and back and the hotel while you're in  all right.
Right.
Er medical practices er  which is the company, erm do it slightly different than other er the other companies in for training.
They send their prospective consultants out for two days before they come into head office for the three day training.
Right.
So you're first erm port of call will be with er a trainer
Right.
for two days on the Thursday and Friday.
Right.
So we're talking about a start date of next Thursday.
Yes.
Is that all right with you?
Any problems?
Well er I'd like I'd still like time to er think about it you know.
Think about it.
Erm well as I said to you today one of the things that you know
Yes.
ninety nine out of a hundred people go out there and they they've we've fixed a date to start and then
Yeah.
what er if you have to think about it what's your doubts?
Pardon?
What are you're dou if you've got to think about it you may there are obviously some questions in your mind.
Are you going for other interviews for instance?
Yes.
Okay.
What's in salaried jobs?
Er well into financial services.
You know what I mean but erm
Oh are you?
Yes yes.
Going back you know I'm looking 
Well okay well look I I now I need a commitment.
So what what do you think what do you think about this about this thing?
Is it for you or not?
I don't thing it's for me.
I don't think it's for me .
Okay.
I don't think it is for me.
Right.
Okay well er er that's the decision we make today so what what why do you think it's not for you.
As a matter of interest.
You made that decision that's fine with me okay.
Er erm er you're on commission only is that right?
Oh absolutely.
Yes so you're you're are you self employed
Yes.
under that?
Yeah but surely sorry I I have to why do you question that now?
That has to have been explained to you on the phone.
It must have been.
Yes.
Er it was explained to me on the phone.
Okay.
Er so you put your own stamp on
Yeah yeah you're self employed  
Yes yes.
Weren't you self employed before in financial services?
No
Right.
No I've been on salary.
Okay.
I've been on salary you know.
Okay.
Erm I have been on commission basis.
Yes sure.
Right.
Er I have been on commission basis.
Erm and erm I like the idea of erm you know basics you know basics .
Why?
It's only commission in another form.
Oh yes that's correct.
Well makes you lazy.
Oh it doesn't.
Well  it doesn't make me get lazy .
Well let me tell you er er this this'll this'll make you hungry and you'll earn a darn sight more money without a basic.
Anyway I think you've made up your mind there er
Yes that's right.
But but you say you prefer a basic.
Well I I prefer to be employed right rather than 
Okay well 
even if I've got to start from commission only 
Trevor with respect you've just wasted a hell of a lot of time for you and me haven't you?
Cos 
Well not really.
Not really 
Cos it's cost it's been 
I phoned up and I got phone up to ask for the information right?
I was 
But you 
I was keen on the brochure.
I had a look through and I thought well I want to go and
But it's self employed and you didn't want to be self employed by what you've just told me.
Er
Mm?
Not really not at this particular stage you know what I mean?
Well if you're able to get a salaried position at fifty three in financial services I would suggest you know good luck to you fine.
Okay Trevor well
I mean I've already been offered well three or four jobs already like.
Well okay.
I've already been offered three or four jobs with salary like you know.
Well why didn't you take them?
Right.
Erm because 
Because this is self employed .
Because it isn't with you see.
Right erm today with
I don't quite understand your rationale here.
Well you don't all.
You see with the financial services act er financial services they can offer you a job right
Mhm.
but you you can't they can't they can offer you that job right but it's qua you have to qualify yourself by going for training.
Right.
Okay.
Same way with you.
Okay.
If you go for the training right and you're no good at the training
Mhm.
you know you turn out to be you know
Right.
Er  no good  er the same way with the financial services act.
They cannot start anybody immediately 
Oh fine.
okay.
Exactly the same as what you can't do.
Yes yeah.
you can't start them off straight away right?
Well we once your training's done you'll get an assignment on the medical 
That's right yeah 
practice side
But you can't go out tomorrow, I couldn't out tomorrow and start doing it .
Oh no because you wouldn't 
That's right.
you wouldn't be able to do it.
That's right .
It's as simple as that.
Yeah.
Well it's that same with 
You would not be good enough.
It's the same with every com you know it's the same with the erm interviews I've been to before right you know what I mean?
Mm.
They have a training course now of
Oh yes sure.
of a fortnight.
See 
Oh well yes.
Well 
see they've got it to for a fortnight which you don't get paid.
You know what I mean?
No no.
You don't get paid.
Well I'll tell you what I I you know seriously er with what Norman would have told you on the phone self employed commission only erm if you er I I'm surprised you came to see us.
Yeah.
I really am
Yeah.
because er erm it it you know it's erm if if you made up your mind you you if you've had offers of salary I don't know why you're not taking them.
Erm you'll not earn as much money with us.
Er er with er with them as you will with us but er
I don't think er I don't think I'll earn more money
I don't think you will.
Well.
No there's more money in advertising.
Do you think so?
Yes.
I mean er some of our chaps are earning thousand pound plus a week no trouble at all.
Thousand pound a week.
Oh sure.
That is that is that's becoming n almost the norm now whereas mister average used to be
Yeah.
eight fifty.
Yeah.
S eight hundred to eight fifty.
Oh there was an example of of my 
Yeah yeah.
Okay Trevor well that's er that's the end of the story.
Right.
Erm
