I wouldn't entirely agree, that the whole, that all of the purchasers are entirely  just because of er their age
no, no
don't think you become entirely vulnerable just because you age, I hope not anyway
so, so do I, but er at the same we said this much to Mr  that you would except that many of the people who the company deal, deal with are old and concerned with a limited income on fixed pensions, you know that don't you?
the, the majority of the people the company deal with certainly are er pensioners
yes
they come from all types of er social backgrounds
I'm sure, but they're many of them are concerned about their budget because they live off a fixed pension 
I don't know what the, the figures would be, er many of the residence actually had, had a considerable amount of er capital, because they had traded down into these properties
erm, I understand that they might trade down, but equally there are a number and I can take you to the letters written to the  if you like, are you saying you didn't realize that many of these people would have to budget, carefully budget
I, I'd just, I'm not agreeing with the situation many, I'm not saying there wasn't anybody, clearly people were 
some 
some people were on fixed incomes 
right 
as I am
well now let's, let's go back to it, some people  might rely on their savings and some might of been mislead, that's correct
as I said earlier I don't believe anybody should of relied purely on the brochure, they had legal advisers
oh I understand.
Does it say anywhere in this brochure, do not rely on what is in this brochure, but contact your solicitor who will have more information, does it say that anywhere?
it doesn't say about contacting a solicitor, but er, er each er purchaser had a solicitor appointed and further information was provided to that solicitor 
obviously we will come to that.
But Mr  if you know that in the real world ordinary people will often rely on statements in a brochure like this, don't you agree?, that's the object of it
I, I don't know, I certainly wouldn't rely on just a sales brochure if I was making a major trans  
no of course you wouldn't, I don't suppose Mr  would, but the whole purpose of a brochure like this, is not necessary a dishonourable purpose, it's a hook the punter, to use Mr  elegant word, he want to make it so simple to hook the punter and make him or her say to himself that's where we want to live and set their heart on it, that's all the purpose of this brochure in it? or is the 
yes it is, it's part 
it's like the television advertisement
it's part of the sales process, yes
yeah
yeah well I mean so sure saves umbrage of course you didn't you'd be, er, I'm sure much more er careful, but then you're an experience er business man in the flash of youth.
Mr  so glad er generous compliment from my Lord


do you want to ask him something?
if you were aware that er when you voiced your concern Mr  did clearly agree with you, right?
subsequently in that instruction yes 
in your or about the break of nineteen eighty seven
er correct
but equally we now know until the Daily Telegraph published its article on the ninth of January nineteen eighty eight, some of these brochures with this representation or claim was still in circulation to the general public you know that?
I've heard that evidence given, yes 
well Mr  says he discovered that after the Telegraph article  and to document of the papers that relates to it that supports that, did you discover that too?
I didn't personally discover that 
well if it was your concern that wanted that sentence out, was it your concern to see that the brochure was withdrawn?
no, I'd voiced my concern and I understood the instruction had been given for the brochures or for that particular part of the brochure to be withdrawn and
would it help for my Lord and the jury who's business would it be to ensure that it was withdrawn, who's business?
Mr  gave the instructions
that doesn't answer my question, who's business would it be to ensure that the brochures were withdrawn?
ultimately the sales and marketing director
who was at the time?
Mr 
thank you  so have we got this right beyond measure in the chain, the responsibility in the group of companies, you bring to the attention of your board and ultimately to Mr  the fact of your concern about the centre piece
correct
he gives the instruction, the brochure should be withdrawn
correct
and it was Mr  task to ensure that it's carried out
as I understand it, yes
thank you,Now I go back to the table, let's try and er get down to some specific example, when would er, when was  priced Westcliff on Sea?, when, when was that begun to develop er Mr
er, I believe it would have been nineteen eighty five
nineteen eighty five  and we can see the picture of it, or a drawing of it  on page seventy, I haven't looked to see how many apartments there is
a hundred and thirty nine
a hundred and thirty nine, so, oh yes I see it page seventy seven it tells us I think how many, a hundred and thirty nine, and this is obviously a pretty big development
certainly is, yes
is it at the top end of the, it starts at the top end of the slope?
it would be yes
and again approximately how long would it take er from the commencement of the building to completion, er approximately
er in this particular case it was released in phases so 
yes 
it's probably, it, it may of been up to three years
I understand  and you were responsible at all times for the figures which estimated the maintenance order and management services?
correct
were there a number of brochures therefore printed  sir?
I believe the brochure had been updated, yes
you believe, well what are we looking at here, page seventy eight, it's been produced by er  for  are we looking at the first brochure, or an updated version or what?
I imagine this is the first version
why, why do you imagine?
because it, er because these statements still contained within it 
oh you mean the  statement?
correct 
well how often did you update the figures for home ?remembering when started in nineteen eighty five
I don't recall the actual month the scheme opened in nineteen eighty five
no
I believe it was towards the end of the financial year, the figures probably would have been updated at er the end of nineteen eighty six
so when would the first figures be given by you for the purpose of printing, approximately
probably early in nineteen eighty five
what was, before the Spring?
probably er Winter to Spring nineteen eighty five
you mean the Winter of eighty four, five?,
Christmas eighty four
say January eighty five
right, in or about January eighty five?
yes
I'm not tying you to a specific month, but about January nineteen eighty five you would give the figures for the printing of the first  brochure
correct
when would the last sketches er be around so to speak in broad terms to, to look for  about
oh, because there were so many units it was er a long selling period
approximately what year were talking to?
it probably would have sold out in nineteen eighty eight
eighty eight  so are you saying the brochure was reprinted between nineteen eighty five and nineteen eighty eight?, by 
I imagine the first reprint would have been erm
er it doesn't matter if you know
no I don't know, but I, I, I imagine the er first reprint would have been September nineteen eighty six
well as the person responsible for giving this information to the public  you would, you would be anxious to get it as accurate as possible wouldn't you?
it would have been updated in September eighty six
can I come back to the question if, you see if you don't answer it I'll repeat it, you as the person responsible for the figures would be anxious to make sure they were reaching the public accurately
correct
thank you.
If you gave these figures in January nineteen eighty five, approximately by when would they be out of date and inaccurate and would require updating?, approximately when?
they would have been updated in September nineteen eighty six
oh, they may of been updated then, the question I asked you was a different one, when was the moment when they became inaccurate?
er, I, I can't say that they became inaccurate, they may well have been entirely accurate for the whole of the period from when they were first produced through to September nineteen eighty six  
what for twenty one months?
yes, because it's only when the scheme actually starts to operate that you can er get a clear picture of what the cost are going to be, they are budgets, they are estimates and until you start incurring costs you can't be absolutely certain as to how the costs are gonna end up 
I see, when would you start knowing what the actual costs were, when would you start knowing ?
er towards the end of the first full financial year
give a month for the year please
September eighty six
you're saying until then you won't have no idea if these figures will be accurate or inaccurate
that would be the most appropriate time to determine that, yes
are you saying you wouldn't know whether they were accurate or inaccurate until twenty one months later?
I would say that they were accurate when they were produced and there produced on the basis of accuracy at the time and they would be reviewed after the first financial period
are you saying, er, I'll put it a third time, are you saying or not that you do not know whether the figures that you published are accurate until twenty one months later?, is that what you're saying?
the figures were accurate when they were produced and the figures
how could they be accurate if they are an estimate?
well they are an estimate of what we believe the running cost would be
that's a different matter, when do you know whether they're accurate?, twenty one months later
after the first er effectively after the first financial period
twenty one months later
in this case, yes
well in your experience, after the first financial year, did the figures require adjustment?
they would require adjust because we're then looking towards the next twelve months
would they require adjustment?
they would require adjustment for looking ahead, yes
do you as a person responsible for the figures, ensure that they were adjusted?
they would have been adjusted, yes
yes, I'll ask you the question again, did you as the person responsible for these figures, ensure that they were adjusted?
I would have requested the adjustments to be made yes
to whom would you make that request?
to the er sales and marketing people at 
of whom Mr  is the most senior manager, at the time
at the time, yes 
so speaking from your knowledge, you would have made the request in or about September nineteen eighty six that  should be updated?
correct
and provided it with a 
correct
in order that the first brochure be published?
yes
was that done?
as far as I can recall 
what is there in this brochure that tells me whether it's the first edition, the second edition or the third edition?
in this brochure it doesn't
it doesn't  who's responsibility would it be to see that the old brochures were withdrawn and the new brochures were put on in there place?
sales marketing, Mr  ultimately
Mr   with hindsight yeah, I think you would accept Mr  a clearly, clearly is a vital thing to preserve the integrity of good name of  to make sure if humanly possible these brochures are accurate and updated as possible, you'd agree with that?
in hindsight I would
yeah  and since the Daily Telegraph article indeed system has changed as you say, hasn't it, in eighty nine?
many systems have changed since then 
no this system
this system
about updating these figures
this system amongst others, yes
maybe many others systems have changed  
indeed 
but in terms of what goes in the costs of the management charges in the brochure the systems changed since the Telegraph article hasn't it?
yes
and the changed is to have those charges automatically updated once a year
correct 
so let's go back to home  for a moment  you say it was updated or should of been updated twenty one months later, as the first update
yes
was it updated a second time or did you ask for it to be updated a second time?
I can't recall precisely but I, I imagine yes it would have been up, I would have asked for it to be updated at September eighty seven as well 
well please don't rely on imagination  would it of been part of your duty to ensure it was updated in September nineteen eighty seven?
yes
are you in possession, that you're aware of any documents where you issue a request for the brochure to be updated in September nineteen eighty six or September nineteen eighty seven  is there any document either in your possession or one you would get by another, from   your request for updating these brochures
if it's not already been disclosed, probably not
take it from me that I haven't seen one and if there is one I'd be grateful if somebody on your site would point it out, but to my knowledge no such document has been disclosed.
Would it be done by a document?
it would normally, if I recall correctly at the time, there would normally been a memorandum listing new charges for each development
exactly, so it would be a document issued by the  by you the  with the intention of what Mr  and in effect update  brochure here and in charge
it wouldn't of gone directly to Mr  no it would have gone to his er regional sales staff
who would you send it to?
it would have gone to whichever region the sales manager responsible or the regional managing director
well who would it go to ?
it would have gone to either the sales manager or the regional managing director of the Eastern region of  at the time
names please nineteen eighty seven
I can't recall 
will you promise to have a look er will 
there were a number of changes of er, in that position of regional managing director
no, no, but were would the documents be in ?
I don't know, if they haven't been disclosed I, they, they probably have not been retained.
Can you lay your hands on the second and third addition of the brochures then?, if there were a second and third edition 
I personally don't keep copies of all of the brochures
no, no, it was just a  bound to be a   cos you see, let me explain something to you  until you gave evidence today, certainly I didn't and maybe others didn't realize in this court room that what were looking at is that one edition of the brochure which may of had several editions, do you understand?
yes
and you Mr  revealed something new, I hope you don't , there may of been two if not three editions 
of the costs possibly
well you said the brochure had been reprinted
why I don't think the whole brochure would have been reprinted 
page two 
I'm talking about the er
page two
the changes to the costs
well is page seventy one, which you're  will be reprinted  and it would require a  what is it of er page seventy eight 
yes
so there are two pages what would have required a reprint, seventy one and seventy eight
yes 
the first reprint should of occurred twenty one months after the brochure was first printed and the second reprint about twelve months later
I believe that to be true
and the person ultimately responsible ensuring that happened of the system would be Mr  is it?
well ultimately I guess, there is a regional managing director for each region who would er be responsible for their region
are you able to help this jury with this simple matter, to your knowledge, on this development, on a hundred and thirty eight or so apartments  did you see the second addition of this brochure and the third?, did you personally ever see it?
I don't recall 
but this whole case is about management and service charges and you're person who erm assess them for the purposes of the brochure, you say you don't recall whether it's the second or third addition ever seen by you?
not, not specifically, no 
let me ask you something else  on a development Mr   I  when I watched use the er help  from time to time there are major items of expenditure, after the properties built, correct
correct, yes
let me give you one example, there are  many of these developments had flat roofs didn't they?, not all of them, but some had flat roofs
a minority, yes
a minority, they were covered with felt rather than ash felt were they not?
in some cases, yes
they would require replacing every seven years would they not?
seven to ten years would be normal
other major items of expenditure which would require replacement would be lift ropes is that right?
correct
corridor carpets 
yes
car park tarmac
yes
boundary walls
yes
warden call systems
yes
and alarm systems
yes  after different periods of time there not all
quite, quite obviously they don't all   There was in nineteen eighty seven before the Telegraph article no contingency fund in your budget was there?
no 
when did the contingency fund first come into the budget?
erm 
approximately 
we approximately  the subject we had been looking at for some time so I approximately, nineteen eighty eight, nineteen eighty nine
oh no, it wasn't there at the time of the Telegraph article was it?
are you talking about this particular scheme?
I'm, no, no, no, I'm talking about the principal of putting in a contingency fund  in the charges
well as I say I recall it would have been nineteen eighty eight, eighty nine, I can't recall precisely
after the Telegraph article 
I believe that to be the case
thank you.
You thought it was a good idea didn't you?
yes 
so it meant that for some time before contingency fund development was introduced  you must of had some concerns er about the accuracy of the figures you were putting forward for the publication, can, can I explain that a little more?if after a few years a major repair needs to be carried out there was no contingency fund, it might mean sticking another two or three hundred pounds a year on the service charges, might it not, to cover a major repair
in prac er, in practice er it is unlikely that there would be any major repairs at the cost of the residence within the first eight to ten years
well you already agree with me that a flat roof might require replacing in seven
it might in general 
might 
generally ten years, I don't recall any, replacing any flat roofs of less than ten years
we needn't argue of seven or ten, but let's say eight, I don't care, but when that fell due it would mean wouldn't it, there would be a major charge to the there residence, whoever they were?
unless  don't agree to pick up the cost
ah
which they often did 
come on Mr   don't generally pass on the cost
no, that is not correct, in many cases  went well beyond what they were legally obliged to do
why, because it would have been unfair to charge the residence?
it depended on what the particular er problem was at the time, if something failed after four or five years it was then covered by insurance by the N H B C or by  guarantees 
I see let take it from the other end, why did you have to take the insertion of the contingency fund of the estimates
because I believe we should be planning for long term er to repair the 
exactly, but why wait until nineteen eighty eight to discover that, how long had you been doing these estimates for?, how many years have you been doing?
on a limited number of schemes we have been doing the estimates for four or five years
no not we, you I'm asking Mr  you have been doing estimates for four or five years have you?
yes
by nineteen eighty eight?
yes
so you, that was, you started doing them in about nineteen eighty three?
yes
and approximately how many sites would you have given estimates for between eighty three and eighty eight? approximate number
er, well that was changing all the time but we had erm like 
but is it twenty, thirty, forty, I just don't know
oh it would be, been er probably eighty schemes
eighty  obviously I'm not tying you to a figure we just want to get some idea, so seventy, eighty or ninety as maybe, about eighty schemes over five years you've given estimates for
yes 
which didn't contain a contingency fund element
no
correct
the main, er the usual recurring cost was er redecorating cost which we had introduced a fund for on the outset 
sorry can, can we get to the question again, want to see if I've got it right, correct me if I'm wrong, over the eighty schemes and the five years that you had put forward budgets for all, you hadn't included a contingency fund element?
that's correct
that's correct  and it was your suggestion that a contingency fund should be introduced after the Telegraph part
in nineteen eighty, nineteen eighty nine, yes
yes, did that require the approval of Mr  or not?
again that would have been a matter raised at our board and passed on
could you please answer the question, would your suggestion require the approval of Mr ?
ultimately, yes
did he approve it?
yes 
readily or not?
yes, I don't recall any argument
right, Mr  did it require his approval, as the, as it were officer in charge of brochures?
no
it didn't require  approval
no 
and with hindsight, although, don't think I'm being over critical, although you put forward eighty or so estimates for different schemes, with hindsight it's clearly more prudent and fairer and accurate, more accurate to have a contingency fund isn't it?, in the, in the budgetary cost
as a management principal one should include a contingency fund
yes
as earlier as is reasonably to do so
what, it didn't need eighty schemes did it to be launched before you introduced it, it's something you'd been wanting to do wasn't it?
something we considered that er
no, no, something you had been wanting to do, not we, you had been wanting to
yes I, I wanted to introduce a contingency fund
yes, had you met opposition to the introduction of that contingency fund?
no
well why wasn't it been done earlier?
because I didn't 
 
I didn't raise it earlier
I see.
You spoke to Mr  er the journalist concerned didn't you?
correct
did you ever raise with him back in January nineteen eighty eight something that you and Mr  had both raised before, namely that what goes into the brochure is not to be relied on you've got to look at the solicitors correspondence, to interpret what is in the brochure, did you?, did you ever raise that with Mr  the solicitor's correspondence?
I don't recall that being a subject of my conversation, er
is the answer no you didn't raise it with Mr ?
er we were given very little opportunity to raise anything with Mr 
is the answer you did not raise it with Mr ?
only because there was no opportunity
Huh, er just, please help us, you know we get on much better, of course you can give an explanation, all Mr  wants, you requested is said whether you did raise it, of course you could say, we didn't, I didn't because erm of so and so, because there wasn't an opportunity or whatever, but do tell us whether yes or no whether you raised it surely that's possible Mr  isn't it?, isn't it?, am I trying to assist you, during my people are just not answering the questions, put it again in blunt form Mr  would you please
well the questions a very simple one, back in January nineteen eighty eight, on any occasion you spoke to Mr  either before or after the first article did you ever raise this question with the solicitors letter?
no
thank you
we give it if you say why?
will you turn to page find one, thirty four,What we're looking at is the accounts for  Westcliff on Sea, the year ending thirty first of August nineteen ninety two, last year
correct
look please at item four, on page one, three, four  second paragraph,the contingency fund is designed to provide funds in order to pay for major repairs or replacements which may arise in the future  these accounts do not include the contingency fund despite strong recommendations from  , can you explain please Mr ?
yes the residence association at  er did not agree to the introduction of a contingency fund
I see, so you weren't able to have a contingency fund at 
there is one there now, but we weren't able at the time, no
at the time   had you been strongly recommending it since eighty eight?
we, eighty eighty to eighty nine as I 
yeah 
say can't recall, we would have been recommending contingency fund 
you you would
yes
yes I understand  Mr  very much.
You erm stay with T one, three, four please  just so that we er understand the point you're making and I would ask you if you'd be so kind as to keep your voice well up.
These are the er accounts that Mr  put to you, are they audited accounts?
Yes they are
are they provided for the residence at 
each residence gets a copy
we can see at the bottom of one, three, four  bearing in mind that these are the August nineteen ninety two accounts, we see at the top of one, three, four that there have in fact been an adjustment there for the previous year to August nineteen ninety one  so that there was in fact an amount of surplus created to the residence of a hundred and eight pounds, eighty P, is that right?
that's correct
so that the budgeted estimate for the previous year had been too high and there is an adjustment in favour of the residence for the following year
that's correct
when you've got a budget for an oncoming year, assuming you and I are here together in November ninety three and we're preparing a budget up till November ninety four, can you ever have precise figures which will be accurate to the last pound?
no, simply because it is an estimate
so that's your budget estimate, when we get to November nineteen ninety four you and I together we will then find out what has happened in practice
correct
in this particular twelve month period your budget estimate would be  wrong in that you needed to pay the residence back a hundred and eight pounds
that's correct
well then, let's stick with contingency fund shall we?you've told us that you wish to have a contingency fund among others at 
that's correct
a contingency fund will be a fund available for any particular unforeseen occurrence in the future
unforeseen or, or knowing expenditure, what is unforeseen is when the expenditure is going to occur
exactly, but who has to pay in to the contingency fund if it's agreed by the residence?
the residence have to pay
so their charges would go up if you had to have a contingency fund?
correct
does that go up as part of the management charge or part of the service charge which is not related to management?
it would go up as part of the service charge, the management charge would not change as a result
exactly 
Are you leaving the accounts Mr ?
er my Lord I was going to
can I just ask him one question about it, erm, I'm not an accountant and you probably, I'm sure you know a lot more about accounts than I do, but in fact if you look at the revenue accounts for the year we're talking about ended August nineteen ninety two at page a hundred and thirty two, do you see that?
yes I do
you see there are two columns, the second column is budget, that right?
yes
and the first column, although it's not headed is, presumably actual expenditure, would that be right?
er yes
good, and if you rummaged over the details, if you look at the bottom  er, you'll see  er  account, total costs a hundred thousand, sixty hundred and forty four pounds  budget  ninety six, eight, seven, four, so that er there in fact it looks as though the actual costs were something erm nearly four thousand pound er more than the budget, do you see?
yes
er, if you just to avoid doubt, it looks as though, as we presume we go back to one, three, four that's less than the income was the revenue from things like the guest room and er the lounge  and so on , you see?
that's correct
so there you, you get on the accounts you get a, a er, apparently, income er extension of the scheme budget by nearly four thousand pounds, three, eight, then you go back with what Lord  was asking you about and I just want you to explain it if you can, if you can't tell me, as he drew your attention to surplus per audited account at August ninety nineteen one, a hundred and eight, eighty, so that, in fact the year ending nineteen ninety two, along these accounts we're dealing with, in fact the expenditure of exceeded budget by nearly four thousand, the previous year er in nineteen ninety one er it had gone the other way that er 
that's is 
is that how I understand how it worked 
entirely right 
so you're talking about, the, the little note at the bottom of nine, of page one, three, four is not dealing with accounts er that relate to nineteen ninety two, which the rest of the three pages are, but dealing with the previous year, is that right?
it's, it's for the previous years accounts, yeah 
yes it is 
can we just erm clarify that Mr , of course it's dealing with the previous years accounts, but until you get to the end of the previous year are you going to know whether you've over or under est estimated on budget?
no, it's the same situation until you've complete the financial year and you audit the accounts you don't know precisely what the situation is
so if at the bottom of page one, three, four there is the benefit to the residence of a hundred and eight pounds, when does that come into consideration in the year ending August nineteen ninety one, or the year ending August nineteen ninety two?
they, they would normally of er received that during the year ending August nineteen ninety two
thank you.
We also see on page one, three, four and this is something you also mentioned Mr   that if you've got certain costs they will be covered and you gave a number of examples, one of them you said, er, we were covered by insurance
yes
now we can see that at one, three, four, about a third of the page down, can't we?
yes
now who actually insured the premises that the residence live in
we insurance the premises on behalf of the residence
you insurance them centrally as it were and each resident has to pay part of the insurance cost?
through the service charge, yes
thank you, is that through the service charge or through the management charge?
through the service charge
thank you and we see here that erm one thousand eight hundred and fifty six pounds had been claimed, that one thousand eight hundred and fifty six pounds thirteen had been received so the insurance cover had paid
correct
you mentioned another protection which is the N H B C, that's, National House Building Council guarantee how long does that run for when a scheme, from the commencement of a scheme?
ten years 
now at the end of the day, whatever your own views about a contingency fund are, bearing in mind that it's service, not management charged, if the residence don't agree can you simply dictate to them that they've got to have a contingency fund?
er, I'd believe in theory we could because the lease provides us or gives us the opportunity to do so, but we would not go against the wishes of the residence
thank you.
Now on the management charge which is what I want to ask you about, cos that's what you've said in the brochure, on the management charge, did you deliberately set the management charge too low to hook the punters?
absolutely not 
shall we just look at one or two erm documents that you've already looked at please, would you go to page twenty nine, just the illustration that seen  and this is  the   I'm not sure whether a point is going to be made about this or not, but if you look at page thirty one there  there's a golf club on the left and a man fishing on the right
this is a golf club?
beg your pardon?
it's a golf club?
er, er I'm sorry we haven't had any evidence of that yet
I thought it was suggested that
yes, but he said he never, it was suggested but 
oh I'm sorry I asked 
Mr  has great powers but he can't give evidence on this case
not on this occasion
no
let's assume that Mr  is right in the suggestion he put to you about the  building on the left, that it's a golf course and we can see for ourselves without any evidence there's a man fishing on the lake at the bottom there, were you trying to suggest that as part of the deal at  a lake would be provided or a golf club?
no of course not
well what's the point of the lake?, that's what's been worrying me, I was going to ask Mr  what is the punter supposed to see?
what do people do when they retire among other things, by way of amenities?
they play golf and go fishing
thank you  and if you walked around  to look at the flat, would you find a lake and whacking big golf course in the middle of it?
no 
now let's erm just go on to something perhaps that's more to the point, you were asked on a number occasions er what information was given and so for and when, er can you see in fact on some of these documents that the brochures are indeed dated?, just look at er  please, you can see that it's a printed brochure  it's got a number of er additions and then we look at page thirty seven  boldly state you have that as twenty sixth March eighty five, don't you?
correct
are you be able to tell us would that page at twenty six m , eighty five be part of the original brochure or part of something which erm was later brought out?, looking at the type and the print in the brochure, if you can't help us just say
I couldn't be sure on that point
look at erm page forty would you please, this is  at   if you look at page forty one there you've got people playing bowls at the top there, maybe another retirement activity and at the bottom of the page forty two it's dated nine eighty five
correct
so that indicates print date of September eighty five?
yes
now unfortunately at page forty two there's a sticker originally that says forty two, but just let's look at that shall we?, cos you were asked about what was said to people and what they might know or understand,while these particulars are prepared with all due care  and the word that's been stuck over is convenience  while these particulars are prepared with all due care for the convenience of intended purchases, the information contained therein is intended as a preliminary guide only 
correct
did you know that was in the brochure?, that it was a preliminary guide only?
yes 
and do we find that in fact on the other brochures, for instance at page fifty two, I don't want to go through them all, I'm only giving an example or two, page fifty two there you see, a sticker unfortunately er obscured in part, same words, bottom of fifty two,while these particulars are prepared with all due care for the convenience of the intend purchasers, the information contained therein is intended as a preliminary guide only 
correct
now if someone therefore becomes interested in one of the developments, would they be any doubt buying the houses without having a solicitors assistance?
that would be most unusual
and even if they did buy without a solicitors assistance, what was the system about sending them the letter which we've looked at earlier which is at erm D one, five, two, remember this is the letter that goes to Mr  solicitors  assuming you get a very rare person who does his or her own conveyance
it would 
does that letter still go them?
it would have gone to them and, rather to their solicitor, yes
one of the things at the bottom of one, five, two is the N H B C agreement that you mentioned with Mr 
yes
so let's just look again at one, five, three please  you see you were asked about whether or not the brochure would be updated and when it might be updated, in what particulars circumstances, do you remember Mr ?
yes I do
shall we just look at er item four on one, five, three, because this is er sent out on the seventeenth of June eighty five, right, see that at page one, five, two, and it says at four  the service charge, the estimated service charge for these flats for the year ending thirty one August eighty five is  and then the flats are set out there, three hundred and eighty two, five, seven, five and seven, six, four, that's all in respect of because we know this was an  flat, we can see that from page one, five, two, but when, whether or not the brochure is updated  when that letter goes out to their solicitors, have you seen other similar letters of this sort going out?
yes it's pretty well a standard letter that goes out
and if you're for instance dealing with a purchaser who's interested in buying around about December  what was the system that you had about saying what the service charges might be?,
I mean do you relate to the brochure necessarily or does the 
no 
letter relate, does the letter relate to the time of purchase?
well the letter would relate to the time of purchase
thank you  and it said there in apportionment, page one, five, three again,calculated from the date of legal completion to the end of the then current half year, will be collected on completion, please note that these are estimated only and will be retrospectively adjusted when audited accounts are available  now we've seen the reflection of that in practice this morning haven't we?
correct
on the accounts for 
yes 
You were asked whether you told Mr  about the solicitors letter 
yes
did he ever ask you about what information was given to solicitors?
no
would there of been any problem at all in your providing it?
none what so ever
would you have been willing to provide it?
yes 
how long was your conversation with Mr ?
approximately ten to fifteen minutes
had you had any opportunity to prepare yourself for the sort of questions he might be asking?
no, none
when you offered a meeting which does not seemed to be in dispute, either you're travelling to London or making yourselves available in  Corma were you offering a ten minute conversation or were you anticipating that you would be able to deal with any questions he might have?
we were anticipating being able to explain in detail the entire procedure relating to accounting
when you say the entire procedure, would that of included or not a solicitors letter which is set out?
yes it would have done
did he show any interest at all in having those details provided for him?
he, he did not agree to a meeting 
did he give you a reason why not?, did he say why?
because he had a deadline to meet
did he ever explain to you what the urgency of having to have the article in on the following Saturday was?, did he ev , did he ever tell you anything?
er no, not, he didn't explain the urgency 
You spoke about what was said in the brochure that management charges  had been or would be running at about a rate of inflation, we can see it on page fifty six, it's better if you look at it I think, rather than I parrot phrase, see fifty six if you so kind  now see fifty six is talking about   at Broadstone   will the management charges greatly increase  the answer is no    management service, er, sorry  has appointed U K leading management specialist  for several reasons, firstly because of their professional caring attitude, secondly because time has shown that management charges, rises the rate either slightly below or at the levelled inflation  when that brochure was produced in respect of that development was that statement true or was it not?
it was true 
you were asked a few questions about the contingency fund, was setting up the contingency fund, had it got any connection at all with the Daily Telegraph article?
none what so ever
the Daily Telegraph article comes out in January eighty eight, was the updating or the answering of the brochures periodically anything to do with the Daily Telegraph article?
it was not
had the updating gone on at all before the Daily Telegraph article came out?which is in nineteen eighty eight
yes 
did Mr  ask you any of the questions about updating or the historical pattern that had been shown by management charges?
no 
was there any discussion about the difference between the service charges and the management charge?
not at that time I recall 
When you're dealing with people who may want to buy retirement homes, er how do you describe them?, they've been described by Mr  as the punters you see, how'd you, what do you call them?
precedence, or prospective purchasers at the time
is that the way that  treated people?, calling it hooking the punters?
not at all, they were customers
have you ever heard the word or the phrase hooking the punters, either at  or  or ?
never 
if somebody comes as a resident to one of the developments that you now presently run   are they there normally for years or for months?
they're normally there for years 
if they're normally there for years, is there any purpose at all in trying to deceive them before they go and live there?
there wouldn't seem to be any purpose it, wouldn't be right 
my Lord how that  under my cross examination I don't know, I've never suggested that he was trying to deceive any resident
no, I, there's get, a little confusion coming into this case I think, I'm not blaming anybody, as I understand your case Mr  as put to er as put to Mr , you have expressly disavowed any suggestion to this witness that there was any deliberate attempt to deceive any prospective purchaser
that is correct
what you, your case is as I understand it, I've only intervened cos I think the question didn't dis  perhaps a lack of understanding this by Lord  allow me to say so, what you're saying is that erm, in fact, although not intentionally you're prepared to accept the format of the brochure in relation to the on going charges  was such as could reasonably be said by your newspaper to have mislead prospective purchasers
that is so
that is the point of the case
and 
now the avoidance of doubt, when you've got to another aspect of the case quite different, namely the claim for special damages, you were suggesting to Mr  that there, there was a deliberate attempt to and after all whereas you might not like my er use of the  to swing on to the Daily Telegraph
yes
er the costs which would have been paid in any event that's all the case is 
your Lord, your Lordship's got it absolutely right
I, I understand that my Lord, I 
yes but you were, forgive me Lord  you were asking him about deliberate er deceit or there wouldn't be any point in deliberately, get the exact word, misleading the prospective purchaser
of course because that's the way that the plaintiff's claim has  and, and, and that's why 
oh yes I understand it 
and that's why it's A, sorry, that's why it's A relevant and B important
right, well, I'm, I'm not worried about the point as to whether it arise out of cross examination, I seldom am because there is always erm can be an opportunity for further cross examination if the other party wants to, so er on the grounds of the objection I, I, I don't uphold it you can ask that if you like, but er I do want the jury always to keep their eye on that what really is the issue in the case er certainly from the defendants point of view, I know what you say
but, erm the issue from the plaintiffs point of view of course is erm just 
well you say the article meant that your clients were being accused of deliberate deceit
certainly
and in the end the jury will have to say which of the two versions of the meaning they except  
and thereafter decide whether or not the meaning is made out
correct, good, now, so ask your, do ask your question
my Lord I've asked it and the witness has answered in fact
oh, good, huh, I assumed the answer was no
it was
I was listening to Mr , yes, thank you
yes, thank you Mr  would you step down please
thank you
er one that occurs to me, no, no  speaking on it myself, the jury might be interested, sometime I just like to get a feel of what a brochure looks like, not divided as it obviously has to be here, could, could we see a couple sometime, not, not now
yes 
and then the jury, I can pass them to the jury, now then, sorry
no, no, my Lord I have three applications to make in the light of the evidence given by Mr  yesterday and this witness today, er the first is this in terms of this witnesses evidence, I don't know whether your Lordship appreciated it, but I certainly did in terms of evidence, that in cases of some brochures there were a number of editions, in other words first, second and maybe third edition
well certainly I believe Mr  he, I don't think he went into the same detail as Mr  I, but Mr  certainly left me the impression that some at least of the brochures were, went into more than one addition, yes
er, my Lord there has not been disclosed by the plaintiffs anything more than one copy of the brochure for each site we've got in the  my Lord might I therefore formally call for disclosures of each addition of the brochures that the jury have them
well erm you can't no doubt do that at this moment, but I, I think it's  as Mr  undoubtedly said, quite apart from anything Mr  said er, if there are a  several addition er which strangest with the relation to the er  important part from our point of view, or an important part mainly these residence on going charges, that sounds reasonable
good, er I think that's right, in fact erm a large number of brochures were in fact on our list of documents 
yes 
erm disclosed erm  there are dates on some of them as I established 
yes 
in evidence
well could that be further looked into 
oh certainly 
and any
any copies of that 
any suggestion because I think the jury would be interested particularly with the dates on them, but even if there aren't compare the figures in different editions
certainly, and my Lord my problem is I'd liked to see them before I cross-examine Mr  the er, the next witness cos he, he was the  the officer in charge of brochures, er I don't know whether the defendants can get, the plaintiffs can get them before but er, I mention it now, the second application my Lord, er your Lordship recalls that Mr  evidence is at a meeting of , he brought up his concerns about the accuracy of the inflation sentence in the brochure and a board meeting in , no board meeting to that effect has been disclosed
no minutes you mean
no minute  and I call for and ask your Lordship to order the production of any  board minute meeting recording that concern of Mr 
yeah
and more for completion the third application is this, yesterday Mr  referred in his evidence
not yesterday
I beg your pardon, the last time before
yes, the day before yesterday
the day before, er Mr  referred to in his evidence, you may remember to a company called 
mm
the  employer  and I asked him what documents they produced, what report they produced  we have written a letter about it, but I formally call for any report or document from  and the second thing he mentioned were letters from about twelve members of parliament that they received
well I think he did say those ought to be in their file
my Lord
he said that, that they should be 
but I, I, I call
yeah
for production of those letters from the twelve members of parliament 
Lord  you can't deal with that er at the snap of the fingers obviously, but I think you'd agree that er going from the number three upwards that if there is any reports from  management er and if the letters from the members of parliament still exist in your clients file, they would be disclosable
well my Lord I, I simply don't know, erm
er no, if they don't exist so be it
I simply, I simply can't deal with the question because some of these are, are raised now for the first time
no I'm not, I'm sorry I said some of them are raised now for the first time, I was about to say I'm not complaining I'm simply pointing out, standing here without the instructions I can't deal with the matter
no, of course you can't now, but will you have enquiries made and if er, there are an existence of twelve members of parliament ledgers, any report from crisis management and any erm, any er, er minute of a board meeting er at  er directors at which the contingency  er, at the contingency fund was discussed or recor any recording of value, having enquiries make sure that they exist and then tell me er if, if, if you're prepared to disclose them
my Lord sir
that's all
yes
I don't expect you to do it before Monday anyway
no, no, my Lord of course I do
yes, I didn't think you'd make any objection at all cos
no I'm not
I'm not suggesting for a moment it doesn't cross my mind nor has Mr  suggested that there has been any er deliberate failures to disclose something which was thought was, which you've got and was thought relevant, but it, things do turn out to be potentially relevant in the course of the court appearance 
well I I'm happy to have those enquiries there 
thank you , well you know the three categories, now what about erm, er, I'm very anxious to proceed today as far as we can, what about Mr  er remind me erm reading with two and three er I'm afraid I've forgotten exactly what you, oh I know you wanted to know Mr, er before cross examine Mr  you want to know about all the additions of the various brochures, is that right?
my Lord the  officer is he's the wonderful from  who is closest to the brochures and therefore
mm
responsible for er, I never realized until the witness gave evidence, the last witness that there were different additions
oh well I, I think it did, it did emerge but not so clearly, but it did emerge in Mr  evidence
my Lord be that as it may, if there are one, two or three additions of the same brochures, of the same development, clearly we, we should be entitled to
oh
all that's been disclosed is one as far as I know, erm your Lordship can see that I at some stage need to have a look at them, er before I complete in any way so I can cross examine Mr  er my Lord may I just say this, on the seventeenth of November, that's two days ago, we asked for the  documents of the necessary twelve M P's two days ago
yes, but, er
I'm not complaining about it, but I say I didn't raise it for the first time
no, well, some of them might have been, don't do squabble about that
no, no, my Lord I have raised for the first time the  board minute
yes
er my Lord it wasn't, I wasn't raising it for the purpose of your Lordship mentioned, er namely er  er about er contingency fund, though indeed will be entitled to that, I raised a question of the minute, the board minute, to do with the concerned with Mr  rest of the meeting about the placement 
mm
that's why I was asking them for, I just want to make it plain my Lord
thank you
but my Lord that subject to that er I don't think we'll loose time because I'm sure by the time Lord  has examined er Mr   I'm going to reserve a little bit of cross examination, which is Monday
mm, mm in any event members of the jury I, I forgot to mention to you earlier, er, thank you Mr  you probably feel a wisdom of this having done several days of this case, two and a half hours is just about as long as anybody can be expected to sit and listen to evidence and er, what I was going to do, and I hope it doesn't inconvenience anybody, I was going, instead of going on for three hours till one o'clock, I was gonna break off about half past twelve to about half past one, to break up the day as you know, I hope that's alright, so what we'll do we'll go on now and, and I'm sure, I think it's doubtful if you would have got to that point by half past twelve, and then you and Lord  sort it out and your learned duties as much as you can in the adjournment and then tell me afterwards what the brochure position is, I'm sure you've no objection to disclosing any brochures that you've got that erm, or can get er which relate to that point
a lot of brochures have been disclosed
yes
difference that  for instance erm there were four  house brochures
there you are
they've, they've been disclosed, it's eight, nine and ten  
they may they may have been in your list of documents, but copies of them may or may not of been handed over but 
simply don't know
well could you try and sort that out
of course 
when we have a break, preferably midday, alright so, I don't want to ask you to alter your chosen order of witnesses you see, er but equally we want to get on if we can
oh entirely
I know, I must see, you think or Mr  can go on, right let's have Mr 
Mr 
and get as far as we can and break off about half past twelve for an hour 
Could you hold the book in your right hand
Just a minute, no, no, please just while those people, just the wrong moment to leave court, they should never  yes, try again
hold the book in your right hand and repeat the oath after the  I swear by almighty god
I swear by almighty god
that the evidence I shall give
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth
shall be the truth
the whole truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
and nothing but the truth
thank you
Mr 
take a seat
would you keep your voice up also please
certainly
towards the jury, thank you.
What's your full name and your address please?
Kevin  erm 
is that in Dorset?
that is, yes
how old are you now?
forty three
what's your present occupation?
I'm a self employed marketing consultant 
just a little about your background please, I think you went to Dundee Polytechnic
yes
did you er obtain a Diploma in marketing in nineteen seventy five there?
not there it was at er another college
which was?
thank you  I think you're a fellow at the institute of marketing
that's correct
and er you have on occasions, at various times, lectured on marketing at various institutes of education including Bournemouth university
that is correct, I am currently doing that as well 
thank you.
When did you first become connected with any organization in the  group?
nineteen eighty four 
which company did you go and work for?
in nineteen eighty four there, there was only the one company  they hadn't divisionalized, so I joined  er company in nineteen eighty four
what as?
er a group marketing manager 
did you stay in that position or do you erm change?
in nineteen eighty six I think it was the company divisionalized and I was promoted to sales and marketing director of the erm, I think it was the developments division, which was, was the retirement housing division
so that's 
that's correct 
in er nineteen ninety one  did you become marketing sales director for the whole group and a main board director?
that is correct 
now in nineteen eighty seven, what did your job involve?
well as a divisional sales and marketing director I had two particular jobs, one would be erm in developing if you want the alteration of sales and marketing and the other one would be looking at overall strategic in sales and marketing 
did you have people working under you?
I had at that time, and I'm trying to recall probably two or three people working directly for me, yes 
Mr  told us about regional offices, about how many of those were there in nineteen eighty seven?
I think at that time there were seven regional offices
would they also fall under your general control?
no, not directly, each regional office would have a regional M D, managing director, who would actually be on the board, the divisional board with me, each regional M D would then have his own regional board on which there would be er finance er finance director, sales and marketing director, construction director, land director, not all of them, all seven had that board immediately, some developed that board, grew that board over a couple of years 
apart from being marketing director for developments, er did you also deal with marketing of other aspects of the  group?
well not directly, erm because the whole purpose of the divisionalization was to put the skill and expertise into each division, at the initial stage of erm divisionalization there were no other marketing people immediately in those other divisions, I was occasionally called on to assist but progressively as they built up there own marketing expertise then my needs were less, they needed me less.
in nineteen eighty seven were you familiar with the advertising budget and the advertising spend of  and ?
yeah 
prior to the Daily Telegraph article in January nineteen eighty eight, had  or  or  had they been in the habit of spending large amounts of money on national publicity?
most definitely not
Mr  er I think I saw a smile there, why were you smiling?
because  part of the reason why  were very successful and profitable was because they're very cagey on money we spend and on, on the resources erm, they had been advertising but it was on a very small limited regional budget, national advertising is actually, they'd of been a  or too
what was Mr  attitude to spending on national advertising in so far as you could work it out?
we didn't think it was necessary and not necessary at that time, we were success advertising regionally.
Er, were you familiar with the brochures that were distributed?
yes 
who's responsibility was the contents of the brochures?
well there was two parts to the brochure, erm, the, there was the general part within the brochure about eighty percent of the brochure was general for every development, the other twenty percent which would prefer specifically to that development, so there was a corporate field to the brochure, but for each development it would have it's individual flavour, that would show pictures of the locality for example, hence the golf and the erm lake and the erm specific costs of running that, that responsibility would be the responsibility then of the region putting in, cos obviously at the centre I wouldn't know whether there was a golf course in that area or not.
er, could you have erm the, agreed  in front of you please and just look at C thirty  that's erm  you can see the golf club in this one, at er the  page thirty one and the man sitting on the lake at the top of thirty one, yes, I think we know the brochures, we've got erm leisure pursuits like bowls, that sort of thing.
Who would actually draw up the wording of the brochure?
The wording referring to the specific location in the location description would by definition have to be drawn up the region, cos they would have intimate knowledge of the locality  that er sorry and the costs would be drawn up by the region because they would know as I say intimately they would know that specific development 
would you er still look at page thirty one please  dealing with er , top right under the   are there hidden costs?, the answer to this is definitely no  and then there are charges set out there, there's the freehold security set up there and then the only other costs would be your apartment, local authority rates, individual electricity costs, even if this means too low  there's a freehold security set up there and then the only other costs would be your apartment, local authority rates, individual electricity costs, even if this means too low, small charge for using guest bedroom, use to keep the general running costs as low as possible, and then underneath them there's a block  service apartment costs, all maintenance, warden and management services, freehold security  and then personal costs in an estimated weekly total, er did you know that that went into the brochure?
yes
Could you look also please at page fifty six in the same tag  which is home  which was  forty nine, it carries on to fifty six, we can see there you've got the same thing but you've got a drawing there and not a photograph of something that's in the area, Court Castle in Dorset
I see
will the management charges greatly increase  page fifty six, the answer is no and then we've read this several times, did you know that was in the brochure?
that photograph, yes 
one of the things said there is,time has shown the management charges rise at a rate either slightly below or at the level of inflation, a fine record not easily beaten  what, what do you say about whether or not that was accurate in nineteen eighty five for instance?
it wouldn't of been put in if it hadn't been accurate  at the time 
now reverting again please if you would to the one we first looked at which is er , see the costs set out on page thirty one there  and we can see under personal costs with the star that refers  please note that these charges are an average and depend on personal electricity consumption and are subject to verification and local authority assessment , er did you understand the difference between the management charge and the service charge?
yes 
can you ever control the service charge component to make it level with inflation as opposed to the management charges?
no I would have said no
thank you.
Did you yourself come to know about the article in the Telegraph?
yes 
prior to that article January eighty eight, was it being your personal desire for about whether or not in the year nineteen eighty seven going into the nineteen eighty eight or to have national or wider advertising, your personal view
my personal view was that  we, we should have some form of, two things, one is communicating the realities of the situation, it's a fairly new market, there was a lot of competitors in the market, coming into the market, there was a lot of confusion in the market there was a lot of confusion in the market as to exactly what it was that customer could buy, there was also a lot of confusion of as to, cos there are different types of customer, and over sixty five, there are about seven different categories, there was a need for someone and I believe it should therefore have been the market leader at that time to if you want to establish principals, establish what they, this was in the market and establish what the elderly would be, would, should look for when purchasing a retirement apartment.
and what was your desire in nineteen eighty seven before the Telegraph article, about increasing on spending advertising, keeping it the same or decreasing?
well I, I wanted therefore to put take  project into the national press and to promote the  product, given that that was the larger product in the market place and therefore if you want that would set the standards for the rest of the market place, that's what I, I felt we needed to do that with the increasing number of competitors moving into market place
but in nineteen eighty seven that expansion of advertising and therefore ad advertising costs in  what were you thinking of in terms of roughly in nineteen eighty seven?
oh I can't, I can't remember, sorry
are we talking about tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands or what?
if it was the national advertising campaign and knowing  and er basically then, I wouldn't of thought I'd be talking anything above a hundred thousand, I would and, and I can't remember the exact figure but given 
no I understand 
the situation I wouldn't of thought I could of got away with anything much more than that
did you propose in nineteen eighty seven as an increase advertising spend
in specific terms I can't remember, I would have certainly of said that for the year er nineteen eighty eight we should build into our budget an amount, what that amount was I can't remember, but er that was, that was never given the go ahead
how was it dealt with internally?,
I mean you have the idea, you want to expand advertising, which means you've got to spend more money and you said it was never given the go ahead, who at the end of the day would decide about whether it had the go ahead or not?
well the board would
which board?
er, first of all I would put it to my divisional board to my colleagues to ask for their thoughts and their advice erm, if they rejected it then it wouldn't go any further, if they approved it then it, because it was a budgetary item rather than just we can go out and spend it tomorrow, it was going into the following years budget, it would then go to the P L C board and they would have final say in whether that element should go into the, into next years budget
and who is chairman of the board, who had the final say?
John 
so that was not given the go ahead in nineteen eighty seven
that's correct
I therefore need to ask you about the article and what happened subsequently.
Now you saw the article?
yes
it came out on a Saturday, do you remember where you saw it?
yes, I was on a coach to the boat show erm at Earls Court when, when I read it
was it on the day of publication?
I think it must of been, it had to be on a Saturday I believe
yes
yes, that would have been the day of publication
now we already know that there was a meeting which was called fairly promptly for the Monday of the following week which would have been the eleventh, did you attend that meeting?
yes 
Mr  has told us there were well over twenty people there  was the article discussed then?
that was the purpose of the meeting 
did you yourself have to do anything follow the art following the article?
following the article or following the meeting?, that meeting
you're quite right following that meeting which was after the article
I'm not sure there were too many decisions actually made at that meeting
why was that?
because at that meeting you can imagine that twenty people gathering then you end up not really making any decisions, far too many people, there was a lot discussed and aired and it concerns expressed and it was a case, and I'm going from recollection here, it was really a case of let's go away and think about it and calm down and look at it rationally
er, we've already seen a press release which was put out as  prompt step, what was your own view about what should be done after the Daily Telegraph article and it's comments about ?
well I think that, that the, the sending out of the press release immediately was, was quite correct, because obviously people had ride that, sorry people may have read that and something therefore had to be said, my personal view was that really this article is you had, if you like had undone everything that we had been trying to do, erm and put us in a bad light and it maybe my Scottish background, but I don't like people calling in to question my motives and the companies motives, erm and I felt that it went straight to what we were really standing for, given what I explained about my thoughts in nineteen eighty seven, it was hitting straight to the core of the whole proposition and everything that  stood for, erm and that is what was the great concern and because it wasn't just like a, a mild slap in the face it was more like a knife in the ribs, it was therefore required a lot more thinking about as to the reaction that we would then have to come up with.
Did you yourself give thought to the action that you thought would be required?
yes 
what conclusion did you come to?
oh I came, came to several conclusions, erm, one, one of the problems that the article faced me with, if it had been a simple outburst, if, if the, the Daily Telegraph had simply taken an advert out as opposed to maybe editorials then I may of had less a problem, because the problem with editorials is that they are believed, companies adverts aren't believed, well they're partially believed, but an editorial carries a lot more weight  and therefore when it's written like that it tends to strike home much harder, therefore that, my immediate thoughts were that if were going to react, if we were going to find a way of cantering the problems we felt this had created, then we would not have to follow any normal course of action, we simply couldn't put an advert out because nobody would have believed it, we would have to look at it a different way of actually cantering and that's part of the reason for the time taking to think it through.
Would you please go to tag L  two, six, six to begin with  just to lead you into the chronology, you have told us that in August nineteen eighty seven, er there was really no interest in national budgeting, er national advertising budget, we can see this is a memorandum from you Kevin  dated the fourth of August and you're sending out to the regional marketing executives, there's no national advertising next year which would be eighty eight.
Again marketing budget at two, six, seven, the point made there again, numbered item one in the bottom third  no national advertising  and then two sixty eight, this is a meeting of the twenty fifth of February nineteen eighty eight, present including Mr  and yourself   today I send  that's Mr   pointed out that so far our reaction to the recent media criticism had been totally defensive in future these actions to be defended, but then attacked in order to regain our credibility  were you indeed present at that meeting of the twenty fifth of erm February?
yes 
in February had your own thoughts begun to cristalize about what needed to be done in response to the article?
yes
what had your thoughts sir cristalize as?
well my thoughts had cristalized that we would have to change the direction of er, we communicating with them as we've done in the past, we couldn't just use adverts that we might have used regional in a regional press, we had to pick out the point, in the, in the actual article so that four example there were six or seven points that had clearly been made, statements that had been made, I had to devise a scheme then, er, it was only a scheme in my thinking that actually, I had to devise a scheme that would pick up each of these points encounter them, now there was no way I could simply take an advert out and say, they said this, we say that because that would have had no credibility, so what I was thinking at that time is how we might be able to use some other form of being able to counter those six or seven points and I started to come up with an idea perhaps using a third party, because in our business, third party recommendation are very, very powerful and when selling to the elderly because they do not take, I'm sorry, they take a long time to come to a decision, they mull over it and such like, they take a lot of influence from people, take advise from family, accountants, solicitors, bank managers and such like, so the idea of having a third party in a sense recommend then would have allowed us to get over those particular points, so that's what was germinating in my mind at the time
and is that the thinking that lies behind the eventual  getting of Terry Wogan and Angela Rippon?
that is correct
that's in an interview format isn't it? in the 
yes 
advertisement, and do they actually sit down in an interview or is that simply the way that the advertisement is projected
well what in actual fact happened, it's not easy to get Terry Wogan at a moments notice to come and sit down, what in actual fact happens is that we draw up exactly what it is, that, that he would be saying and what the answer will be, he sees that and it's totally approved, understandably he's not gonna put his name to anything that he doesn't believe is, is correct and that is how it's done and 
I understood though I mean it, it looks from many of these er publications as though it's meant to convey that Mr  and Mr Wogan are sitting down and having a conversation or Ms Rippon isn't it?, that's how it's presented, is that right?
yes
but it didn't, but, that isn't actually, that isn't what happened you're saying now
it's meant to show that Terry Wogan is asking John  a question and John  is answering the question
sorry I don't want to take, erm of course out of hand
