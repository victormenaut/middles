The press release that I I put erm  to the internationally known bearings company.
Right er 
Which you secretary seemed to think was okay for that one.
Yes it should be  shouldn't it Jane?
As opposed as opposed to oblique.
Well yeah yeah.
Yes
Right.
As opposed to oblique.
Okay I think what 
Erm 
I'll do in that case is hold this press release because you may want to change it again a little bit.
Er yes.
Yeah yeah.
Well erm what what does holding it involve?
Telling them not to post it tomorrow.
Not to post it tomorrow.
Right okay .
 
Yeah, I mean that's not going to miss us a particular slot in the in the publication  .
Oh no no.
No not at all.
I look if I can do that now, I can save erm
Right.
I can save her photocopying it.
Right.
Erm
Yes that would be a good idea wouldn't it.
What would I do without these things I don't know.
I've I've got an appointment in London at five o'clock so I've got to leave here at about quarter to three.
Right.
To get the the three o'clock train.
No problem.
Yeah.
If you'd like to just have a look through that, is that paragraph where I put a line  
Yeah.
Hello?
Chris?
Chris?
Er Rosie the the press release number six that I've given to Sandra, will you tell her to hold it please and not to send it out tomorrow.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry?
No no to do nothing with it.
Yeah, I'll sort it out tomorrow morning.
Alright, bye.
Good.
Just there is a little bit that I want to add that erm that teachers get free admission.
Ah right.
Good.
But does that paragraph 
Yeah I I think in principle that that 
Yeah.
that's er that's fine erm 
Yeah.
er the internationally known bearings company.
Er er what should we what have we been u have we been using any particular sort of of form of words Jane?
No.
For that?
Because actually  isn't internationally known.
It's the  that's internationally known and the  's internationally known 
Yes yes.
but the fusion of the two is not .
I think I I I don't think we're in treason of the truth .
I No I think it's probably that's probably about as you're going to get anyway .
Yes yes.
Er e erm.
I think that'll be okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that'll be okay .
And then what we will do, later on we shall do another press release which will talk more about the  
Exactly exactly what's erm gonna happen.
Right.
Erm to persuade some of the nine hundred schools to reply to us.
Right.
Yes Good.
We've got twenty five schools taking part at the moment.
They're already committed to too 
They're already committed which is quite good in January .
Right.
Cos we'd got I think, about twelve last year at this time.
Erm Now what we want to talk about if I can Well you tell me what you want to know I think that's the best .
I I think what what I wanted to put some more meat on the basic idea so that 
Yeah.
our factory colleagues, and Jane as far as the erm preparation of of er any equipment and so on is concerned 
Yes.
can actually start thinking about what what we're actually going to do.
Yeah yeah.
So er because there will be certain input from the factories.
Erm David's Newark erm  Road based
Yes.
er and and erm e erm Eric's erm  Road based 
Yeah.
so we've got the two Newark factories represented.
Yes.
Er and Jane looks after all the publicity er er preparations and that sort of thing so 
Good good.
so that really it's to try and er get us thinking about what we could do 
Yes yes.
because there may be initiatives that can come from the factories er which would bring the thing alive also for local 
Yes yeah.
people in some way.
So erm Philip could you could you just begin by putting a bit more meat on o on what the competition how the competition is envisaged to work .
Yes yes I will.
Let me tell you about the schools involved in the show anyway.
Er the Nottinghamshire branch of the of the National Farmer's Union are the instigators of the children of the show.
And they together with  who are animal feed stuff and and and corn and fertilizer people, erm organized the marquis and generally do the groundwork that gets the kids there.
Erm and they sponsor that, sponsor the marquis and so does the N F U. Erm now within the marquis there are lots of exhibits that are of educational value.
I mean it may well be there's a there's a lamb, there may be a calf.
Erm there'll be someone talking about cereal production, there'll be someone talking about milk production, this sort of thing.
Now within that marquis you can have a table.
Erm now if you wanted to go larger I say a table because of the size of the marquis and what the  
Yeah.
This is what National Grid did last year.
If you wanted to have something erm larger than that then I'm e I am empowered to say you can have a trade stand at half price.
Right yeah yeah.
Now what I'm really looking at there is that our basic trade stand space i is about a hundred pound.
Erm there's no reason why you shouldn't have double that size the the the basic one is three metres square.
Now I didn't know whether you've got an exhibition unit or something?
Er well we have we have all sorts of exhibition
Yeah you'd better have a mobile unit 
er things that we 
that erm
Well Right, David, you've got a a an input there because we've done a project with the erm er p with a technical college here.
Er for a mobile a mobile unit.
Mhm exhibition caravan.
Exhibition
Caravan.
er caravan.
Yeah.
Trailer
Yes.
Yes.
it is actually isn't it?
Trailer yeah.
Trailer yeah.
Yeah.
Erm and it would be appropriate I guess to to use that.
But that probably wouldn't be inside the tent would it?
Well it wouldn't matter because you see, the treasure hunt takes the kids all around the show ground.
Right.
Now the idea  and collect a piece of treasure, a ball bearing.
From.
Or or out of the reject box.
Yes yeah yeah Yes.
I think we could probably find plenty of them.
surplus stocks.
talking of rejects I was I was conned into going down to Stoke yesterday to look at the Portmeirion seconds shop.
Ah but this is great, and everything is nice and cheap there, I came away paying two hundred and forty pounds  what we bought.
Now that you see so it might be an idea If you have your table within the marquis, that does whatever you want it to do, that can talk to kids if they want and so forth, you see they they're sort of juniors upwards .
Yes.
Erm and then you could have your trade stand where they've got to come and collect something and answer a question.
Mhm.
Now the quiz will be erm what was our I mean if there's a history of the firm  what did  what did  used to be called or something.
Something that you've got on display where they could just read it, pick the answer out.
Yeah.
And they put their answer on their form.
they pick their bit of treasure up, whatever it is?
I mean National Grid gave them a bit of cable.
They chopped a lot of cable into one inch pieces you see and just gave a bit of this out.
Yeah.
It's a nonsensical bit of treasure but they've gotta 
Yeah.
come back with a bit of treasure and the answer.
Right.
Then then then the winner of course is the one that takes the money.
Erm now that sounds to me to be the best way of doing.
Wh what we do you see, they have to wander around the showground doing this, so we get our traffic through the showground and they see other things while they're going around.
As opposed just going 
Mm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
into a marquis and having it all laid on for 
Mhm.
them in there.
Erm now if if we have if we have our er erm caravan and we have the table in the in the tent, they can 
Yeah.
obviously be at opposite opposite ends or different different places so there's plenty of space between them .
Absolutely.
Oh yes  yeah.
We wouldn't put the caravan next to the tent.
Right.
Er are those  Er w would would the would the er treasure hunt just involve visiting that, or or 
Ooh no about twenty about twenty others.
So so
Yeah.
what do we do?
Pick particular stands or pick
Erm we select the stands where the treasure's going to be because some 
Right.
of the treasure might be our treasure or N F U treasure and so right 
I see.
Yes.
we'll put this treasure on this stand.
 
 
Yeah right, I see.
Erm so unless anyone is sponsoring, they wouldn't necessarily have the treasure on their stand.
We'd select other stand holders.
 
And what we'd do, we'd go to say , the farm machinery people and say 
Yeah.
Right will will you take part in the treasure hunt.
Will you give a nut and bolt or something.
Or or whatever  something that they've 
Right.
Yeah yeah.
got low on their stock.
Yeah.
Erm costings if you like that they 
Yeah.
can give away.
Yeah.
Erm  the blacksmith and we give them a horseshoe nail.
Yeah.
this sort of thing.
But they 
Right.
come back with it and we we give them a carrier bag erm to carry all the stuff in.
Right.
And them they come back.
Erm 
And if you've got any goodies you want to dish out to them it helps .
Well well we'll provide the carrier bags.
Yeah.
Won't we, carrier bags.
You have some of those have you?
We have them we have them yeah.
Er and er we could provide as as treasure,
Yeah.
we could provide steel balls in profu profusion out of the 
Yeah.
as out of assembly rejects.
Mhm.
Er and I should think we could supply rollers on the same basis couldn't we?
Er  and
It it would need to be either one or the other I think.
Well I mean these could be these could be collected from somebody else somewhere else.
Yes yes of course.
Yeah yeah .
Er so I mean that c because er I mean they the steel balls and steel rollers go into the bin I mean they can't be used for anything .
Well that's right.
Well yes, absolutely.
Yeah yeah.
So er and and they're quite I mean if nobody's ever seen a er erm 
Yeah.
a good quality steel ball before, they're quite nice things to have and they 
Yeah.
feel soft.
Right.
Yes.
Erm we could certainly do that.
Yeah.
Erm 
Of a size that
Well of a reasonable a re Yes I mean they won't be so small you can hardly see them 
Yes quite quite.
And they won't be s so large as you can't carry them .
 
Erm I just wonder also whether er we could possibly out of our erm surplus or dead stock, provide some er some small complete bearings.
How many how many are we looking for?
How many are we expecting to take part?
We don't know, last year it was about four hundred, four or five hundred.
So we'd need  beginning to get a bit more bu But but in terms 
 
of showing people what.
Y yes.
Yes that's true .
I think  steel balls are But you see you can do a display on your table can't you  
But i but i but in terms of showing people what bearings actually are,
Yeah.
there's nothing like a complete bearing.
No that's right.
No.
Because what the tendency is that people feel that that bearings when when you say a bearing, you mean a steel ball.
And of course Yeah.
Yes yes  as opposed to the ball race  
Er I mean, what we want to be getting them to think about is the complete 
Yes yes.
unit.
So I think we might make an effort
Yeah.
to try to provide erm 
We we it's it's always difficult in January to say how many people are going to be there to take part, but we last year it was about about five hundred I think.
Erm so we ou and carrier bags, we may have enough to carry us through the show, I don't know.
But certainly I mean, if you have carrier bags, you can give them  
I I would like to do that.
You can give them away anyway
Yes.
there's no problem.
Yes.
Er er erm and if we can if if they can all use is it
Yeah.
then that's further
I mean if there's a leaflet you can put in them as well, fair enough.
Make that be your goody bag of whatever.
Yeah.
Erm there's no problem there.
Cos I was going to be ordering carrier bags anyway.
Well I can cross that out you see .
Mm.
Yeah.
Erm I can't remember who said they'd sponsor those, but we'll get them onto something else.
Well they can  Erm so e e and and we ought to provision probably for a thousand.
I would have thought so.
If it's likely to be any more, I'll come back to you.
Yeah.
Er but I would have though that should easily do it.
Er  right so so we're talking er about basically  being involved specifically at two locations.
Yes.
If you wish that.
What I was gonna come onto there is erm can we e e that would involve manning wouldn't it?
On the Friday and the Saturday.
Mhm.
Er would the factories between them be able to help with that for a spell Er one of the things that I'm slightly concerned about is if you've only got old buffers on the stand erm rather than younger people
Mm.
that might er erm lose an opportunity.
Would there be I mean is there is there a possibility of getting some some of our younger people
Oh yes.
involved  on the factory side.
You know this caravan, is it covered with  or ?
It's got  logos all round it.
That's something that I think we need to have a look at.
Mhm.
Perhaps if we may.
Mhm.
Erm and and update  er update it .
The only perm the only permanent er writing on it is er  School and  College.
that actually built it.
That's fine.
Could erm could you perhaps tie up between you, David and Jane, erm so that Jane you could go and have a look at it and see what's actually needed to get that up to date.
By environmental friendly screen.
Whereabouts is this?
It's actually in the in the grounds of the of the college.
You can drive past it, you can actually see from the roadway.
Mm.
Are the college involved at all?
I I've spoken to the college.
Erm
Are they involved i in their own right?
Er they aren't but they I think they're in it on the canvas.
Right.
They'll they'll be part of erm either Nottinghamshire County Council or  
 
District Council.
Both of whom .
Mm.
Yeah.
But it's likely that it'll be the last showing at Notts County Council of course.
Indeed there won't be a County Council will there.
Well we're all hoping there won't 
Er right so erm basically, if we have if we have that stand which erm perhaps could be factory manned
Mhm.
in principle.
And er Jane if perhaps we could organize the manning of the table.
And er I think perhaps if we could put a c are are we allowed to put round the table some
Oh yes.
erm some pictures .
You can you can back the table with a 
Yeah.
with a screen.
That's that's the sort of thing cos we've we've got erm erm perhaps we could put up some of the I mean the ones that you've got out in behind your desk at the moment.
That somebody's just pinched.
Oh have they?
Yeah.
Well maybe we
Yeah but er maybe we could we could book erm half a dozen panels
Yeah.
or something of that with with some photographs on,
No reason no reason why that shouldn't be I mean we've we've got what we use as a as a clip display thing that's about six foot high and three panels you know but erm
Yeah.
That goes nicely behind a six foot trestle or whatever it is.
Oh yes you can dress that little area up as much as you like.
But my worry was that there wasn't going to be enough space there for you to perhaps say all you wanted to say.
Erm I think maybe we need to think about it, we need to give a bit more thought to that 
Mm.
Yeah yeah.
Erm as to how much we er want
Yes.
need to do.
You see if you're if you do have a display  caravan  you can probably do some some grass displays of of large bearings or something in the front of it to
Yeah.
You know for people to have a loot at.
Yeah.
That's not a bad idea from the point of view of the general public really, because that does give you a show to the sixty thousand odd people who are wandering around there.
Yeah.
Erm who wouldn't necessarily go to the schools marquis of course.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right, yes.
Just as a just as a sales pitch for that.
Well you're you're gonna ask us to pay fifty quid for the to to to park the caravan.
I was gonna ask you to pay a hundred but I'll talk about that.
You tell me how big a ground you want and I'll tell you what you're gonna  pay for it .
Right okay.
Good try good try Tom.
Okay.
Sorry I I thought I thought you quoted a price of a hundred and said that 
No I said  space is a hundred pound and we'll give you twice that size for that.
Oh I see.
 
I just I just assumed you'd give us that size for fifty quid.
Well I can talk about this, I mean it depends erm.
You know this marquis, will it just be 
Yeah?
the schoolchildren at that that are actually going into it.
Adults can go into it but we have found generally speaking that particularly on Friday, erm it's full of kids.
I mean it's a place that adults would tend to avoid, the minute the put their head inside it.
Saturday, there tends to be kids going in with their parents.
Erm you see we do we do a family ticket which is used for Saturday, the Friday which admits two adults and four kids on on Saturday for twelve pounds fifty.
Or .
Erm and so kids that don't come on the Friday, tend to come with their parents on Saturday.
And we have made a point of saying in this press release that children can individually enter this as well.
Right.
But if they win it, the prize goes to their school and not to them.
Yeah.
Now of course there is the there is the spin off as well, that you can get some mileage out of the winning school or the first three, by inviting them here or visiting them and so forth ,
Yes.
Cos they're got to divert the money to a project.
They they can't just put it into the school fund.
Right.
They've got to buy some equipment.
The school that won it last year bought a skeleton.
Erm a fully mobile workable skeleton, and th it's a deprived area of Nottingham and they've apparently been able to teach them more with this skeleton over this past six months than than any other kids in the school.
I think they know where to hit people where it hurts most of them .
 
Well yeah, I me I think that's perhaps something for er David and Eric to
Yeah.
er to consider, as to whether whether it would be appropriate to invite the winning schools for er to to bring a party in or involve them in the erm Gala Day or e I mean i erm or the open day or something.
I think whatever whatever's our value 
 
when they come, you're bound to get a picture in the paper of it happening.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm you know, and also we want a picture of The presentation isn't actually on the day, the presentation will be at the school.
Right.
So again  come along and present it you see, as well.
So we'll go along to school Yeah yeah yeah.
Erm now er just just Philip just correct me er on the on the detail of this thing, er individuals pitch up at the tent, collect the collect the instructions 
Yeah.
Yes.
which you've prepared.
That's right.
Er which gives them the clues as to where they've got to go .
That's right it gives the it tells them where they've got to go.
And it will be on and  stand.
Erm It'll tell them where the clues are.
Right.
So they haven't got to find the site of the clues,
Right.
They've merely got to sort the clues out when they get there.
Right.
Right and they'll be told what the clue is.
Yeah.
And so they've got to they they'll be asked the question rather, and they know the answer's going to on the stand that they go to.
Right so so they get the answer.
And when they get the answer they pick up the the tro treasure the treasure .
They pick up the treasure.
Yeah.
And then they're off to the next one.
Right.
And now how do we decide the winner?
The winner is decided erm on the total correct entries and if I'm right there is a slogan to fill in.
But that's all done by N F U,, you need have no part of that unless you want to have.
Right yo I w no I was just gonna say th th there's there would need to be a tiebreaker of some sort presumably .
There needs to be a tiebreaker.
Yeah it isn't the first correct one out, they've all got shout if you like.
Right.
Erm but it's but what happens, they're all done  and N F U rather treasure their erm their their job as the scrutineers of these.
And I haven't erm I thought it's prudent to leave that alone.
Right I I was just wondering if they would i if they would like us to suggest a tie breaker.
Why not?
Why not?
What I would do 
Or something of that sort which might be associated with  like, when was 
Yeah I'll get the next erm I'll get last year's questions.
Yeah.
And just see what they are like, and see what they did as a tiebreaker.
Yeah yeah.
And then perhaps you can sort one out.
Yes.
There's no problem  
I I mean like like the the er competitions cereal competitions, erm invent a slogan for , something like that .
That's right that's right and who knows, you might get a good one.
Might get a good one.
Er so erm  Yes I think something like that would would be erm
Yeah.
er
Yes well I could arrange that .
So the treasure hunt course as it were 
Yeah?
is arranged by 
Is def is defined by  
by the show .
And what we really do, when we've got the show ground plan done you see, we look at which stands are where and say, Right, we'll have that one, that one, that one, this one, and so forth and go  
Yeah and then you just go and talk to them 
Yeah.
and er run off a s er a sheet of questions 
And if and if they haven't got any treasure, then we provide them with it,
Right.
whatever it is.
Yeah.
Erm I think last year, Well what I've got to do, I've got last year  National Grid provided them with pens.
I think we might have that one sorted out.
You've got somebody to give them pens.
We may have.
Yes.
That's that's something I've got to sort out because  
Er that that again if you haven't, we could probably fix.
Could you?
Yes.
Well do you want to do that whether I whether I  
Do we want to do that Jane?
How many er
Well maximum a thousand.
Could probably only five hundred.
How how are we off for for pens?
We'd have to order 
Cheap pens.
order some more.
We'd have to order some more would we?
Yes.
Are yours fairly elaborate ones that you have?
No we do have cheap ones as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That sort of thing.
Yeah.
Well I personally my stock .
I think p maybe Philip it would be best if y er I mean if you've got somebody up your sleeve who 
I haven't at the moment because last year it was it was National Grid who haven't 
Right.
who are closing their Newark operation you see, which has made it rather tricky to approach them .
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shall I see what I can do?
See what see what you can do and perhaps er Jane  you could just look into the possibility of erm because if I mean if we were going to do a run of pens we wouldn't just have a thousand would we?
No.
Not not the cheap ones.
No.
Erm so perhaps we could have a a look and see what whether there is a plan afoot to er do those so that we could have some available for  
 
Yes er I mean that sort  tell me what they want.
It's fifteen by eight.
Fifteen foot by eight foot.
.
Er  right.
Er are you telling me that that is there are any existing pens, they would be in the sales company?
And I might have a thousand stashed away that I didn't know about?
Could have yeah.
Yes.
Er well perhaps I'd better have a look.
You could have a look but like I say, ordering freebies now it's up to the sales people to tell me what they want and I order them on their behalf.
Erm right but but presumably there's some coordination between all the various sales companies.
For for things like pens isn't there?
Well yeah, if if the U K came to me and said, I want ten thousand pens, tell me what which ones they wanted, I would then contact the sales companies, Are you interested to to  
Oh I see.
Right okay.
But I wouldn't just go off my own bat now and order stuff.
Right.
And dish them out to the sales companies.
Right.
Okay.
Er we'll have a lo we'll have a look at that
Yeah.
er Philip anyway .
I mean they are they're funded by themselves.
Er I'm conscious of that.
I'm conscious of that.
Er er and no doubt no doubt David and Eric are are erm noticing how much what we've funding
Mhm.
I mean basically, the s the the funding will come from the sales company
Mhm.
Erm er and erm wh what we're offering you is an opportunity to  erm give your factories some promotion in the local area.
Mhm.
As well as the as well as the erm er the sales activity.
Because from a sales point of view we won't actually
cost you
We won't actually sale
Yeah yeah.
We we we we won't s sell anything.
 
What we will do perhaps is just promote the name,.
sign-writers  
Er that's the object of the exercise 
Yeah
as far as I'm concerned.
I wouldn't expect to take an order or even have a serious enquiry resulting from it.
No.
Erm but I do feel that there is likely to be some positive spin off for the factories.
Yes.
Erm and er I I don't know exactly what's in your caravan but erm er whether you would want to put in something about employment opportunities or the training scheme, er apprenticeship schemes and that sort of thing .
Mhm.
Mhm.
I would think there's a a grand opportunity to do all that .
Oh yeah that's the main area really is is erm recruiting for apprentices mainly to the young people.
Yes yes.
That's why it would be good idea if you could man the 
When is it when is it?
It's the sixth fifth and sixth is it, or sixth and seventh.
six and seventh of May it is 
Six and seventh of May, Yeah six and seventh of May, that's right.
Ideally  have to be recruiting before then really.
Well okay.
Er but but there maybe there maybe some others 
well it gives a picture doesn't it of of erm I mean we do one of the
Erm and that type of stand I mean it  that in a very restricted area haven't you
Yes yeah.
your backdrop and everything.
Yeah.
The caravan is ideally designed as er an exhibition with steps in er either right or left in to see whatever's on show and then out on the opposite side.
Mhm.
Quite wide steps and it's designed as as a exhibition.
So whatever we put inside there, you can walk through it.
Yeah.
Up a few steps, across and out the other side.
Yeah.
It has its own built in generator for the lighting.
Brilliant.
You can boil a kettle in there .
It's own bar.
Not quite, it is padded.
relatively warm.
Yeah, right okay.
Erm so we we need to work out how much space we need to stand it in so that I can get back to Philip and and and agree that.
Oh you've got the dimensions, oh right, yeah .
Well I've got the dimensions here so I can  I'm just thinking you see, I may persuade the society to do a deal of free stands facing  or something like this.
Good.
But see see where we go on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Erm
I mean I know the deal I'd do now but er only being their consultant I can't really clinch it.
You can't commit
Well I can tell Oh I can tell them wh In fact I would be prepared to do that.
Right.
Are you happy with that?
Yes.
You provide the pens, we'll give you a free stand space .
Yes.
Right, done.
  

So we're provid we're we're going to have a table which we will man which will have some sort of display around it.
Some some pictures and things .
that's right.
Yeah.
Er and there will be somebody there.
On that we will provide erm er carrier bags, er some pens  and er we'll probably er dish out some leaflets there as well.
Yeah.
It may be that the carrier bags and pens would go onto the onto the table where the entry forms are dished out as part 
Yeah.
of the package there.
Yeah fine.
In fact I suggest it probably should.
Yeah.
Erm  and also you'll get admission tickets of course.
Right
Erm
Yes.
a reasonable number erm and you and I decide what's reasonable on that.
Right.
Right.
Erm so that's that's that.
We will we will undertake to provide some steel balls, some steel rollers
Yeah.
and some er bearings.
Yeah.
For a as giveaways.
Yeah.
Yes as as as the treasure.
Yes quite.
Er we will mobilize the er the caravan erm which needs updating and modifying to display whatever we want  
Yeah.
And we will man that.
At a at a space which you will provide us Yeah.
Yeah.
distance away from the marquis as well.
Yeah.
Erm and
Yes bear in mind that that of course, that you're going to get quite a lot of adult audience going through it as well as kids of course .
Yes.
Yes.
Erm
I think er er we need some product range leaflets and things like that in and and the er the group giveaway.
D I suppose it doesn't have a er something we could the corporate video on does it?
Oh yes 
Does it?
Tables and chairs and
Oh well we'll we could we might easily use the corporate video for that.
Cos that's rather exciting and and new.
Er that but anyway we can we can organize that
Er within within that space.
The factories will will man well between us we'll work out the manning.
Yeah  Mhm.
You'll provide us with sufficient entries so that the people who are man it get in and car parking .
Yeah yeah.
And car parking.
Yeah yeah.
Erm you're going to arrange the er the course.
Yes yes indeed.
Right.
And we will set the questions.
And set the questions.
Erm.
Yes and
And also talk to you about a tiebreaker.
And tiebreaker, yes.
Tiebreaker  .
And then er in due course, some time after the event, er we need to be erm
You'll do the presentation of the award.
present the award.
school at which we'll invite the press.
This didn't happen last year and I was cross it didn't but I've organized it so that it will this year.
Right
Erm
okay.
I think they daren't take it to  Road at Nottingham for some reason.
Right erm er presentation to the schools and then we need to consider if we would want to invite .
Then if you want if you want to invite them back that's right, yes.
It i it could depend on where the school is you see because the winner was Nottingham last year.
Erm it could be Newark, it could be Lincoln it could be Gainsborough.
Yeah.
Er wherever, wherever they come from .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes it was rather it it was quite unintentional but they The winner last year, one of the teachers at the school was the  secretary's sister.
Oh dear.
And and er this is  
 
And the  society have nothing to do with it of course you see.
But it didn't stop the cries.
Right, okay I think I I've covered everything that was 
Yeah.
er that that that I think will enable us to do our bit.
Erm erm
If there's anything else, do ring me and ask.
Right.
And erm
Okay.
But I will confirm all this to you.
Yes.
the decision's made on the  and the stands space so there's no stand space.
Good.
Erm and what we will do is make sure you've got enough room for fifteen foot by eight foot with with whatever space in front of it as as a as a lawn if you like.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No problem with that at all.
Great.
Great okay.
Lovely, thank you very much indeed.
I will get me down to my 
 

Well you see he said that the problem with  the college site is very few people at the college know how it runs.
Well that's all right I'll I can provide somebody to run it and
But as far as freebies are concerned, as you know our cage driller machine, that's now into it's third year of development, I have an assurance from the college that we could be we could use it on the day.
Now talking of freebies, they could actually watch a cage being drilled for them as part of it .
That's that's 
resin cage, not a brass cage.
Yeah yeah.
Very cheap, but actually watch it being made and then that becomes the freebie.
Wonderful
So that would give the publicity to the companies as certainly as the bearing as well, this I've just had this made.
which which one the the one that went to the erm exhibition, the one that went to the competition.
Cos we're doing another one aren't they?
They're doing another one now the that was a prototype.
Would would I mean could that be operated in conjunction with the trailer.
Well yeah well
Wherever 
As as part of the trailer.
In the trailer 
 
or by the trailer.  compressed air and electricity don't you.
It's no problem, Malcolm's  has got compressed air and and and electricity laid on.
Yeah.
the college compressor for that.
That's no problem.
I'm just thinking now  if there are youngsters there, they see something working,
Absolutely 
And that's an it's an ideal display  see the mechanics working and they take out the cage and off you go.
I think I think that would be splendid David if you could if you could erm organize that er on the on the trailer or or by the trailer, on the trailer stand as it were.
Mhm.
Erm and provide the freebie I mean the the the cages, the giveaway 
 
that would be tremendous.
Cos they actually see it being made.
Yeah.
This was made for me.
And it was made by and  youngster because that's the project  
Yeah.
made by the you know, not made by the the full industry but i the off spin of the industry.
Yeah.
And it's already I mean we've we've kept it in prime condition, painted with company colours.
It does say  on the front of it but
 

And and I I would think I'm just thinking of freebies that just giving them something, and yet if they've actually watched something being made and then
Yeah.
made then erm  
You've just to got be ca You've just got to be careful that you get it i i you've got it pristine working and it's gonna work for two days.
You don't want
Well now this is why  
That's an important thing.
that are now on the project, make sure that it is tip top condition for the event.
Yes.
Er Eric and I know fully  we've been through that, fingers crossed behind our backs.
Yeah.
Situations.
But we had it at the N E C for a week and it must have produced hundreds of cages on a routine daily basis.
They were there for five days and they were producing them.
I'm just thinking now that er we changed lots of things, the heads and things of that nature so it was  If it's just producing the same cage 
Yes, no set-ups or anything.
they're just watch it come in, drill the cage, the cage turns and comes in.
The mechanics of it would capture the young imagination.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Especially if it's demonstrated by the younger people as well.
I think that would be that would be terrific.
As opposed to giving them possibly a ball bearing.
Well  
Well I mean we well Well 
Well give them a ball bearing and a cage.
That's the treasure isn't it, that's the treasure.
Why I'm yes that that might be a bit more complicated because that means we've got to get a thousand a thousand reject up to a thousand reject ball bearings which are all the same.
But we can get the balls and then drill the cases to them.
No no are you I think this treasure is something they're gonna get, they're gonna they're gonna g come to the stand, they're gonna a ask a ask a question and and and be given once they've answered the question they're given a ball, any sort of ball from sort of
Yeah.
that big to that big which we 
Mm.
we can pull out of the scrap.
No problem there is there?
No.
No as far as as far as the ball and the roller is concerned,thos those are something we could give away from somebody else's stand.
Yeah.
Erm and and we could actually give if we if we can find some small reject ball bearings or roller bearings, then we can or reject I mean erm dead stock.
Mhm.
Then and we're always we're always finding dead stock it seems to me, er then we could give those away on yet another stand, give the cage away on the e on our own so we will actually have provided three, four different treasures, all of which are associated with bearings .
Mm.
Yes.
Three components and one complete so 
Yeah.
Mm.
the thing might even begin to connect in the individuals mind er as to what's involved with the bearing.
Quite true.
Erm and and I mean the actual bearing when you you pick up a a a a little miniature bearing and and you can spin it on your finger and
Yeah
so it makes a lovely little toy.
Apart from anything else.
Yeah.
If we could get some of them.
Erm
just round this table  product.
Er I should think we might just have some products on the table and some leaflets.
Are you looking, who are you looking to man it, apprentices or or or young salespeople.
I think I would try and get young salespeople to
Yeah.
er to do that.
Mm.
Erm
We can get the apprentices operating the machine can't we.
If we can get that machine though.
Yes.
Mhm.
Erm and we have a er we could we could take erm a few people out of the er out of the sales office.
Erm and maybe out of marketing as well.
Lots of young people in marketing aren't there Jane?
Well I don't know I don't know about that.
Probably two, me and Karen.
Oh yes.
Right.
Erm
We've got we've got Leslie Leslie  at erm precision .
Yeah but the thing is 
Somebody like me, if I was stood at that table, I mean okay if you've got kids coming in, but if you get adults coming in, I wouldn't be able to answer questions, I don't know enough about the product.
Erm.
No I I I don't I don't think 
You've got to have 
I don't think we need worry about that too much.
No.
Er I mean if I if I try and cover it with one of our professional salesmen,
Mm.
erm I think that's going to be overkill.
Mm.
We're not going to get a lot of serious bearing enquiries.
No.
Erm and I think that part of the skill on the on on such a stand is erm to to show enough interest, to take the details down and say, The only thing that's important
Mm.
it'll be a matter of taking the details down and then if it's that important we'll have somebody call Monday morning.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm to er
Yeah.
er to to to get back at it.
Or alternatively, I mean if it's really that important, erm and and it's on the Friday, we we could actually send for somebody from here to come out.
Mm.
So I don't think 
Yeah I don't I don't think you will there.
I don't think we will.
No.
I don't think we will.
Erm it'll it'll be enquiries which are of very general interest, Mm erm which I should think you're just as much of an expert as anybody else at answering.
Mm.
Come to that.
Er 
Most of the questions are going to be related to to what it is, are there any jobs available, or what  type of thing.
Yeah.
General sort of 
Yeah.
interest things.
How 
Yeah.
how can it help the er the Newark populace.
Yeah.
I'll do Friday and Gary can do the  Saturday .
Right okay.
Done.
Done done done.
Well you don't ne you'll need some other other people erm
Yeah.
other people to help out 
No I was only joking.
but er Oh.
You you're not joking.
I I've written I've writ I've wri it's minuted, it's minuted er er it recorded as well.
So  are we on tape here.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Er so so it's Jane on Friday er er and Karen on Saturday.
No Gary I said.
Oh Gary.
That's why I said I was only joking.
Right Gary on Saturday.
Right, okay.
Erm
No we'll sort that out.
But we need to no we need to sort that out.
Er er  I don't see that it's a big problem.
And er we ought to make a very definite point of putting our heads together perhaps, what do you think, about early March or something like that.
Er m no mid- March.
Sometime mid-March in order to just make sure that we're all you know that that there isn't some great hang-up somewhere.
And that then still gives us four or five weeks to put anything right.
Mhm.
Er  how about somewhere around the twenty third of March?
Right, twenty third of March, would that be a
Yeah.
a good day?
Mhm.
For the moment at least.
Er and shall we say, what's a good time for you?
What's the best time for you?
P P M's better for me.
P M.
Right.
One thirty?
One thirty, fine.
One thirty,Newark Show  meeting.
David,Eric,Jane, Me and anyone else.
If you want to bring anybody else along.
Yeah,
Erm who's involved, that's fine.
How's that grab you?
Fine.
Good.
Yeah.
That sounds exciting.
Well it's a bit different isn't it.
Yeah yeah.
A bit different.
I'm sorry to hear about your er apprentice bay.
Well yes it's er it is rather a a sad story really.
I think after all these these years of having a an apprentice bay running and then er see it more or less wind down.
But at least it's w it's wound down without the apprentices winding down.
Oh yes,we're er as you know, we gave four and a half thousand to the local college this year or last year  
Yeah.
to in increase apprentices into  er the engineering or bringing into young people into engineering.
Yeah.
Not necessarily for , but from the town
Generally.
The idea being is that they would now spend the first year at college, possibly we then would look at them better and 
Yeah.
pick them off.
Right.
And we intend to do exactly the same this year.
So so we've actually  Chamber of commerce to certain people at college and we're hoping 
Good.
it will embarrass one or two of the smaller firms to also put money into the kitty to keep our college orienta er orientated towards engineering.
Excellent excellent 
Because er we can do the arts and crafts, there's no problem, but engineering there's in a sorry state.
Yeah.
 
that the engineering is now safe.
Yes.
Whereas up until a few months they were thinking of closing the engineering department  
Were they really?
college.
Yeah.
So we've er we've come to the front and we've led from the front.
We can honestly say
Well this is what  is faced with doing.
It's what we're doing on a pricing on on a pricing thing as well.
We've we're we're taking the lead.
Telling everybody else what the what the rules are and  you know, what the pace is.
Erm and and er of course, did make a very clear statement that it would be the leader.
Mhm.
 
Well erm we certainly are in we certainly are in Newark.
And I I think the the ongoing concern then is we seem to have got on an even keel with apprentices.
Erm literally training throughout throughout the year.
Staff of twenty one.
Yeah.
All of them have come out of the time over the nineteen ninety three have all been employed by the company.
Ah that's terrific.
Erm so yes I think we're we can we can  say we've been leading from the front.
Yeah good.
And if we've now embarrassed one or two smaller firms into actually putting money into our college.
Wonderful
So er
wonderful
likewise we have some projects to show that we have worked very closely as an engineering firm, with the local college.
Yeah.
And the local people.
As tomorrow we give   Cancer Fund, three and a half thousand pounds, cheque tomorrow.
Do you really?
From the Gala Day receipts.
Oh that's wonderful.
So we yes we are  It's erm beginning to  very good.
Yes very good in in that respect .
Look look quite significant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No longer are we referred to as  although we still  we're referred as  
  
But it's getting it's getting the image it's getting
Yeah.
the image has certainly improved.
Well certainly I mean this this whole initiative is something that I s just seemed to me when Philip  got in touch in the first place, that that something that we ought to er be involved with.
I think e the idea there of the cage drilling machine and the caravan is to show that our connections , with college, what we can produce with youngsters of today.
Yeah.
A and because schools outside the area will see what we've done,
Yeah.
It may give them the light as well as what  
Right, that's that's terrific Terrific.
And we have been involved, I have certainly been into schools a fair bit but but they're erm they are a bit reticent  they're certainly slow to come forward to ask for your for you help and and 
Right.
Wh while while you're erm doing that while you're th while we're thinking about that, erm there's something else on the schools front and the promotional front which which I am in the process of setting up.
Which er I will be officially erm circulating to the factories er later and that is a national erm 
Yes yeah.
Of setting a real live project for a design and technology A level student.
Mm.
Now because of other connections I've done it through Eton.
Er not doing the one this year because of the changes that 
Mm.
are going on and I just didn't feel that we could erm support one.
But with the arrival of Ruddington, er the erm we have a wonderful opportunity there for doing something pretty pretty flashy.
And so I've tried to open it up er rather wider and w what I've I've I've been put in touch with a a thing called the independent schools, design and technology association, which covers design and technology studies in all independent schools.
Erm and in due course, they are hoping, that body is hoping to extend not just to independent schools but to all schools and be a design and technology education association for all schools.
Erm however they're not there yet.
Now it concerns me that er I don't want to be associated with the possible charge of elitism if we're only associated with independent schools.
Therefore what I want to do is to seek the support of the factories to er spread the word, to circulate the information necessary to all the schools in the area.
So that any any school within Nottinghamshire if you like or or Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire or whatever might be appropriate in this area.
However many you thought you could manage, it might just be the two
Mm.
secondary schools in Newark come that.
Erm but that that opportunity would be there to circulate the information and the the entry rules er around the erm er er state schools within within the sort of factory catchment area.
So it's an opportunity for the factories to promote their own activities within whatever they regard as the school catchment area.
The way it's going to work is that we will er that the first thing is to invite applications.
And the individual student will submit an application with some er example of work already done.
And I don't know, I asked th the chap from the I S D T A how many people he thought we might get applying, he said he thought, well if we got fifty we'd be doing very well.
Er so say we get fifty people applying, we will then use those application forms to decide how ma er sorry which ones we're going to go with.
And I've said that the maximum that I think we could reasonably cope with would be five.
And then we would give a complete project specification to the five participants and er we would invite them to visit a factory, to have a conversation with a sales person, to get a bit of a feeling for the style of thee of the be doing area.
However many you
Mm.
out of those, and one will win and we'll have a second and third prize and the fourth and fifth will be runners up and erm highly commended or what have you.
Er and basically what I want to do is to put the winner, the winning e exhibition into the new reception area, for the new erm office at Ruddington when it opens.
Mm.
So that er we can sort of give a great big bit of publicity for the schools, for the individual, for the concept of design and technology at A level.
That sort of thing.
The other four er erm loser er like as not, will be on display and remain on display in the er in in  in the atrium area which is 
Mm.
going to be a display area for product and projects.
So erm we can give them a bit of a
Mm.
bit of a splash as well.
So what what I'm that that that's the sort of basic outline and I see it as an opportunity of putting the  name in front of quite a lot of schools
Aha.
erm and in the design and technology area.
Er it is then an opportunity of getting at five five individuals and giving them a a pretty thorough going over and and a lot of encouragement.
It gives them the opportunity of working on a real live project er which actually has an end point and is going to be used.
It also gives them the incentive of winning some cash.
Er it gives us when when we actually set the thing up and make the presentation, it gives us another opportunity for publicity not only in the local papers o of our own area but the local papers of wherever the school was.
And it could be anywhere round the country.
Erm and I would I would want to try and do some er organize some press coverage at that time for the losers as well as for the winner so that a a and one of the things when we select the participants, er the entrants, er we will not have them all coming from the same school or from the same area, even if the five best entrants all do come from the same school .
Mm.
We won't have that, we'll have them from
Yeah.
where suits us.
Yeah.
Er er er so so we've got lots of opportunity for er getting the  name in front of young people, promoting design and technology and the engineering concept, getting these kids working on something that's real and live, erm and generally promoting the whole thing.
Mm.
So er in the course of the next week or two, I will erm be writing officially to er to each of the factories to invite participation.
Right .
Er and I daresay you'll get involved in that when the time comes .
Mhm Yes.
For  Road and
Yeah.
and and  Road.
Yeah 
So er there we are.
Oh yes..
Yeah.
Of course there's I don't know whether you'd  well you won't if you haven't been involved but we for the last last year and this year we've had this  children from er there's a a sort of Nottingham University
Yeah.
is where it's set up from.
Er and the young people who've left school er who are having a year out in industry before they go to university.
Er and and I've found it very useful in t term
I've just seen this.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yes yes.
At the minute the erm last year's 
 
last year's individual with us he had I think he had he had five A levels of which four were grade A and one was greed B grade B.
That's not bad.
And and er he's gone off to Warwick University to do doing maths and stuff.
And a chap, lad this year's got not quite the same but very very good A level results.
Please.
You must think I'm absolutely barking just to have been sat with this in front of me and not done anything about it.
Thank you.
No Philip  must have been er wondering what on earth it was  doing there .
 

Er so erm
Well it's it's on on the sane vein, just like the machine tool association competition was that the apprentices went in for.
Yeah.
Erm  that was on the same vein and they got they got a ce er a certain amount of national er erm national er publicity.
Yeah.
Milk?
No thank you.
Jane's  have some I think by the look of things.
Thank you very much.
Erm well I don't think one can do too much on that score really can one.
Er any publicity is good publicity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you doing the open day again?
Or has nothing been said about that yet?
Or is it just assumed you would do an open day ?
No I don't think we're doing an open day this year.
We're still having another gala day.
Another gala.
And er I think  throughout the year, er all of the younger apprentices, either sixteen, eighteen year olds have now been enrolled in Duke of Edinburgh Award 
Have they?
Scheme yeah.
And they're all about to do their silver.
One of the somewhat older guy, he can orchestrate it so much so that he gets his gold out of it.
Out in in he he's going straight to gold is he?
No he's done bronze and silver.
Oh he's done them yeah.
And he if the rest of them get silver, he will get a gold.
It's rather rather good actually.
It's a form of team leadership  
Yes.
And er we so we'll we'll pull that in over the year, over this next year and that's one of the projects that
Good for him.
I think younger guys, the sixteen, eighteen year old with their silver award
Yeah.
er and of course the gold award erm  older guys next year's team then can go on for their their gold.
Not that we're making any stipulation as part of their apprenticeship but er I think it's a good idea, they have extra
Yeah.
erm just beyond the engineering side.
What it really means of course is that erm I've committed ourselves to doing the dare I say it, the odd jobs.
It sounds v the odd jobs to do with all the the smaller schools and and 
Yeah.
er kindergartens.
As you know, we fixed the roundabout for the people in town, I can't remember the name of the place.
I used to call it the back of  actually.
But nevertheless we
Yeah.
the the guys went up there and they fixed it and they were very very We had Christmas cards from them and we've 
Lovely.
And so I what I said was, as part of their community service, we would then earmark the various small erm children's homes, old people's homes and they would go as a team of electricians, fitters, craftsmen and do a community work.
Marvellous 
To towards their silver award .
Towards the 
So we will be flying the flag there.
Because of course they will be wearing our  
Very constructive.
And that has a a nice ring to it.
That  younger element, are doing something for the local community.
And we're trying 
That's very good.
we're obviously there's old people's homes here on  Drive, there are lots of small erm kindergartens that will require their appliances being serviced.
Yeah.
And things of this nature.
One project was to literally find out all of the old age pensioners in town and go along as a group of electricians and check all of their appliances for them.
Quite .
Mm.
So  they'll have so many houses to work in,they will go along initially and make sure the plugs on er irons and It sounds very simple but it's part of helping the community.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For their award.
Erm we'll be flying the flag on on those I tell you yeah .
Well that's very nice.
That's very nice.
Good initiative.
Of course they they have to do all that out themselves.
They've got to negotiate with the the er people that run these homes and and erm and that kind of thing.
And set it up?
And set it up.
Yeah.
Oh it's all part of their er their project.
But likewise we were looking for another project similar to what er Eric and I were involved in with the cage drilling machine.
I think  superb projects.
We're only hoping at the end of this year, hopefully the company will incest in it.
And buy some.
They have they not Cos I thought they were going to buy some of these drilling machines .
Oh yes but but but what they're doing now is all the erm, they did the presentation to the manufacturing side,
Yeah.
er with your assistance.
Yeah.
Er they did they did the sales pitch to  and then management came back and said, well we need automatic loading and  modifications to it.
Yeah.
So they've been working on modifications and this year, oh we will we'll put the modifications right and then come back with another sales pitch to  
Right oh I see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're doing another one but I think erm  was talking to er Andy  the other day because erm  I've been in manufacturing management meetings at  
Yes.
where they're talking about spending money on a one of these old old cage drillers, tooling it up to drill cages at .
And and my ears went you know, what on earth are you spending all this money for on that
Yeah.
when when you've got this new technology which you can develop.
Mhm.
Er and it looks as though it certainly in in Andy's budget for this year
Mhm.
and a bit later on, he's looking to put erm I don't know, twenty thirty thousand into building a brand new cage drilling machine based on that technology.
But using the the technicians and  who who the main ones Robert and Bill
Mhm.
with Brian ,main input really.
Mhm.
That sounds excellent doesn't it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So they're looking  because we we at precision now need it but we need it faster than if we if we awaited for this, then put in  and so on.
Yeah yeah.
Erm you know, five years hence, we don't want it in five years hence, we want it the end of this year, early next year .
This year.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
But so far you see, the er  have been involved in it, who have been craftsmen, technicians have all come out of the end of a B Tec qualification with a distinction
On the project.
on the project.
Yeah
so
yeah
er
yeah.
it's
It it it I I think there's a lot to be said for er people doing almost any sort of practical course like that, to give them something which is real.
Because certainly the thing that particularly struck me about these design and technology A levels which so often seem to be sort of er erm a contrived project, not not a real one.
And and the three individuals who I worked with particularly, they'd all been more or less written off, and they all come through with distinctions.
Yeah.
And and the feedba I mean I've had feedback particularly from the parents of of all three, and in every case, er they have said, this was the making of this guy.
Mm.
You know i it's pick picked him up from being very much an also ran for whom there was virtually no no hope, er to leaving the school with a a really good qualification and a sense of pride and purpose
Mhm.
erm er which has really made a big difference.
It's a good thing really, my son did erm A level craft, design and technology
Yeah.
er and erm he he he designed his own thing what what 
Yeah.
what he wanted to do and and then he got a reasonable pass and went off to university.
But I think if er if he'd have had a firm's input, that wanted something designing, he'd he'd have done a lot better.
Yeah.
Because the thing he produced eventually, it fell over at the end of the day  
Yeah.
you you know I mean, but he'd put the the research and the effort into it to get the pass.
To get to get the 
Yeah.
qualification.
Yeah.
But if he'd have had some a little bit of direction
Mm.
from a firm you know, I'm sure he would have he would have got a distinction er an A rather than a B you know.
Well than the other the other thing which I think particularly in the last one that we did which was finished back in March, we kept on changing the specification, because it started off  such a such and specification and it was going to the Hanover Fair in Germany
Mm.
in April.
Or May.
April.
April.
And then we decided not to go to the Hanover Fair, so change the specification so that it could be a a versatile sort of display for whatever we wanted to display.
Er and then I heard from Australia that they were going into the engineering exhibition in Melbourne and I offered them er a mobile display and they came back with one or two added ideas and so I changed the specification again.
That was going to be in May so we needed it to ship in April so I said, well you've got to you've got to still finish it at the same time.
And then Australia came back and said, no that won't be soon enough, you've got to ship it I can't remember when it was, beginning of March.
And so er the guy had to bring the whole project forward a month.
Mm.
Erm and er  he worked like the blazes to get this thing done .
Er and it was quite complex
Mm.
and it worked, and it got over to Australia, it got unpacked and it still worked when it got to Australia, and it went on the stand and it stood on the stand for a week or however long it was.
Er and they've now got it stashed away in in Australia waiting for the next exhibition.
Mm.
Mhm.
So it it was it really worked well.
Very well.
And I'd like to do something like that again.
And I mean, some of the some of the results that we get from this competition, might well be appropriate for a a stand at an exhibition somewhere.
Or it could be that they would be appropriate for the reception area in one of the factories, or we might give one to a distributor and say, here you are, this you know, put this in if you've got the right sort of area and would like to use it for a bit, stick it in there.
You know so there's all sorts of  
What happened to that  The first  
It's in mothballs down in the .
Was it ever repaired?
Oh aye, they repaired it
Yeah.
they were modifying the I think it was the geography of the world.
I mean like Australia 
Oh a mere detail 
in the middle of the Arctic
Put Australia in the Northern hemisphere and that sort of thing.
But er
Yeah.
yes it er I think the the wiring needs to be changed because i 
Yeah.
it had a wooden a wooden bearing would you believe
Did they?
Yeah.
They modified that
Yeah.
I think that was okay.
It required slip rings
Yeah.
Which was a very good thing  most of the the young apprentices would never know about slip rings.
Yeah.
They had to manufacture that part itself.
Yeah.
And er as I say, at the moment  
Well when you when you say it's in mothballs, erm how seriously in mothballs?
I mean if could you take the mothballs off and dust it off and it would work?
Plug it in and it would work?
More or less yes, just a few adjustments and it could be up and running I would think.
Maybe maybe a couple of hours work on it to put it back together .
Cos I mean, that again is something that that one might put into the into the tent or something.
See the idea was it it picked up the the balls, took them to the  and then the ball rolled round inside globe, slowly down to the bottom and then picked it up 
Yeah.
Originally it was supposed to be water wasn't it in in in the bottom.
Er there was going to be water in the bottom at one stage but that 
Yeah.
got a bit too complicated.
Yeah.
He was o he was over ambitious.
Mhm.
In the design.
The idea of the three spotlights of course 
Yeah.
was was  see that the ball
Yeah.
Yeah.
rushing round inside of the literally going round the worlds and then down and then .
Yes.
Erm I know at one time they were the motors were going to fast, the ball was .
But the idea of course was to bring the electrical, mechanical and the technicians to redesign the little bits that were 
Yeah.
Yeah.
erm the inside they they had to redesign that because the wood er had almost become charcoal were the
Yeah.
had been so that 
Had they really?
Yeah.
Erm and again to make it safe, it all ran on a twelve volt system.
That's right, it was on a twelve twelve volt erm wiper motor.
Mhm.
And er and that  that's They had to take the top off to make it safe, that's why I say a couple of hours work to put the top back on, erm makes  balance.
What it really required was probably sandbags or or steel in the base to keep the base
Mm.
Yes.
stable because it was rather top heavy 
A bit top heavy.
Yeah.
with the globe at at at the top.
Well er
I mean a brilliant idea really.
I mean if if er erm er if it would work,
Mhm.
I mean I one of the things that I've always sort of had in mind is that we put it down in the reception area.
Mm.
The only things is that now if we did that, what we want instead of saying  on it, it ought to say .
Well possibly I ought to put it on my review panel and er if there's a requirement for it.
If you could dig it out if you could dig it out
Mhm.
we'd put it down in the reception area.
Mhm.
Yeah.
For a bit.
And then if it if if we have it down in reception for a bit, er and it works and doesn't look like falling to bits, the we could consider taking it along to the Newark Show as well.
Mhm.
As I say, it's that mechanical movement that catches the eye  globe slowly turning round and the
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think the stress and strain on the bearings for instance, the the middle bearing of it was underrated to carry that amount of weight, not in the vertical sense but in the yawing to and fro .
Er 
old spin and and yaw.
Yes it might have been.
Yeah.
It might have been.
They need the extra weight at the bottom.
The shaft needed to come through two bearings to give it that stability .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But erm the idea is  have this up and running and look at the problems.
Right.
So th this caravan aside 
Yeah.
can presume that it it's going to involve  as a whole so it will have some 
Yeah.
industrial type applications and precision applications in there.
Well I I guess the graphics need to be looked at in that
Mhm.
Jane.
Whereabouts is it?
In the grounds of the college.
If you go  by the side of the college you'll see it  from the 
Where you pull into the car park?
under the trees.
On that side.
Yeah it's a sort of er trailer thing you can see from the pavement.
Mm.
They had it on the gala day.
Used it on gala day.
I didn't go to the gala day.
We towed it to er  and back.
That was a feat of
I think the nearest thing to it is probably towing a caravan er a pyramid.
Really?
Yes.
Mm.
Quite a quite a lot of wind resistance .
Aerodynamic  
Yeah.
It wasn't the best 
 
But ideal it's it's very spacious inside.
Yeah.
Erm in that respect.
And erm  I mean we towed it over a thousand miles so the
Yeah.
the local journeys round the town, there's no problem.
Mm.
The average car could pull it.
Mm.
Erm it's very well made  we have a video, watching it being made from the bare
Well
all the way up to it's  
That that's that's certainly something  Do we have a video on a on a loop or anything .
Erm cos that that would be the ideal thing to do wouldn't it .
we haven't yet got copies, they're just masters at the moment but
Ah but we'll have copies by May surely.
If the European sales companies get their fingers out and get the languages checked for me then yes.
I'm quite happy to have it in English.
Erm  yeah that's another thing.
Yeah it c it can be put onto a loop.
Video.
So the  as far as I'm concerned, the the two projects put together erm really do show what we can do we can do with a a team of bods.
Originally the er the idea was to to build this caravan in connection with School.
Yeah.
And er we were told that, we were told that our apprentices would be working alongside apprentices from Mercedes and Volkswagen and and so on and so forth.
That wasn't quite true.
So consequently we made sure that we we picked the best of our guys to match
Yeah.
Yeah.
the German Er secondly there there was a golden opportunity for our apprentices in industry to go and see German industry and French industry.
Yeah.
And so on and I'm pleased to say that they came back saying, Yeah we can still hold our head up high.
The the fact that we are  very good at what we do.
Yeah.
Of course we didn't realize that these would be erm students from from schools.
Yeah.
So their engineering knowledge was very little.
Still basic.
Very basic.
Yeah.
So consequently our guys ran circles round them
Marvellous.
and we balance it out that we had to built the caravan, the deadline  we had to tow it across there in back end of March.
Erm  so it had to have all the lighting, official lighting for the continent and so on and so forth.
Yeah.
And that was a bit of a nice little deadline  the pressure was on.
Yeah yeah.
But er we got it over there and I'm quite pleased to see it, the entire school, six hundred pupils turn out to see this thing being towed up there on a
Wonderful
sunny evening.
Wonderful
And er had a tremendous press coverage over there.
Yeah.
likewise the when it went through the town on the way out, everybody turned out to see this thing leaving .
Because of the association between  and York, being twins 
Yeah yeah yeah.
And people were in the street shaking hands and Marvellous absolutely marvellous you know.
Brilliant.
Of course the  logo was the biggest logo on there you see.
Er and even  lads from the college, it was a mixture of five welding students and and five  students 
Yeah.
er I think our guys stole the show 
Good.
Right, well we're on to a we're on to a new er a new era, a different erm different angle.
Er and erm there we are .
bef between now and March.
Or are you gonna
Well erm  no doubt Jane will actually look inside the the caravan.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Sometime and see what the facilities we've got there.
Erm   I can certainly  no problem.
I've already earmarked the cage drilling machine just in case we did require it, to make sure that no parts were taken off it to support the next one .
Right, good yeah.
Erm this is where we've asked our tool room to supply them with any parts, save taking them off the the original.
To make sure it does roll.
And now if with your wish we can certainly go ahead and make sure it is in tip top condition.
Yeah.
Make sure was have enough material to make the these cages.
Yeah.
Erm so I I'll concentrate on those those 
Terrific.
those two things.
Yeah.
And again the the manpower to run it.
Yeah.
I E if it works out in er that the younger guys to match up with the make sure they've got the experience to actually fault find on the machine if 
Right.
But I'm pretty certain it'll run all weekend.
It ran all week at the N E C.
Yeah.
Wonderful wonderful.
gave erm Robert and Bill and  
Oh yes.
Oh yes.
Oh yes.
The idea is, if one of those and a couple of the younger guys, like we did at N E C 
Yeah.
ideal.
Mm.
Yeah.
Get the expert as well as a couple of supportive
Lovely.
Yeah.
to talk about it.
That's how we covered it at the N E C.
Right.
Okay well I'll I'll do a I'll do a note on on the various headings that I've made so we've all got the same piece of paper.
Mhm.
Erm and then we meet again in March.
Er I'll let you know if there's anything cropping up again before then.
Er but hopefully by March we will be able to say, well it's all ready to
Yeah.
hot to trot.
Okay.
Ready to go.
Right.
Wonderful, thank you very much indeed.
I'll really turn it of this time.
