The computer reads the message and goes up .
There's not even a human being in the warehouse involved.
So that it can all it's all it's all assembled by load by computer now.
So what Alastair's saying is information technology er gives us the opportunity to give you information down er a telephone line.
And our despatcher hardware  er the disk can either.
If they've got their own computer which is I B M compatible we just give them the disk because it's programmed that  the despatcher not the hardware.
It's the software that is the despatcher.
But if they've got their software hardware well it's  the hardware as well.
But really what it does it can either stand alone and print just be a printer put the data in and then .
It's set up with your like your B M S it's got your database in.
It's set up with all their comput .
Somebody comes in and runs a separate form puts all their customer  and all they're doing is when the orders change they just put the  and it prints out notes and labels and if you've got hundreds of them it saves a  job in time and money and the girl .
And what it also does is  is as you call off the  numbers if you've got .
.
Yes he's  he's reading off er yes he's  but that's printing off labels .
But that is the same it's same thing though.
It's a printer comput it's a P C that's all it is and that's what the despatch.
You know if you've got a P C you can use our despatcher system.
You can tie the .
That's what the hardware is.
The programme is the despatcher and it will just be  and if you source your.
You've got a sales code haven't you?
D'ya know what the sales code does on your B M S?
That's right.
Is this yours Alison?
Yes and if  Alison   three seven five a thousand number you've scored one five.
And every time she  
 
Pardon?
It will tell you what you're what you're responsible for.
What can you give the managers about Alison?
Activity and productivity.
How hard you working .
If you put rubbish in you'll get rubbish out.
You know.
A database is only as good as how well it's managed.
I mean  it's not really data system that's  it's the way it's being used.
And it's the same .
A projection you know a warehouse order erm stock and order situation, if you've got a  and they've got people  by source number, they can see how much is being used by you.
So the despatcher can help with your stock control help  in a warehouse situation.
Help you reduce your labour on the just with ordinary notes and labels on volume.
Reduce error.
It's clea quick  and it can link directly to our computer if you want .
So is this just with a few major accounts or  
Erm 
have prospect accounts that we need to deal with?
Fifty weeks you know fifty weeks only ten a day is it worth putting a database in for only ten labels .
But low on that one.
You need to be talking a hundred a day really.
You need to be talking you need to be talking how long  when you were writing out labels.
girl that would actually write out all the notes .
We haven't got one but she'd like to .
Can't get them to print it haven't got a printer.
That's not my decision now.
What I want what I'm trying to get to is the despatcher is an eye and it's far in advance to  but I've had .
Sorry Sarah?
They have specially  network  no not just you.
There's a team of people who are specially  keeping abreast of the technology and they are  by Paul  who heads the erm network operations.
Because it's an operational function really isn't it?
And they set it up.
Something like  they actually set it up even though erm on behalf of the salesmen.
What the demand and supply situation I don't know how we stand on that.
But erm obviously because of the customers it does not always it will certainly come  now we've got this technology but they haven't got the software package.
The software package I mean sometimes it comes with the deal  we don't charge extra.
We feel  price of it you know.
And er .
And how would you identify you were arranging an ex sales form right.
I  how you gonna find out whether it's a  or have they got stock control problems or they need management .
How would you .
Now would you would you how would you would you talk about  or how would you  you know do that sort of job .
I'd introduce  and then I'd .
When you say you want to speak to somebody  despatch, would you ask for the despatch manager or the territory manager or
No 
That's right.
All you're giving out is information at this point in time.
They can't make a decision to change but they can give you the information that we need to bring forward.
And if you do approach a company  this is an enquiry I need to speak to your you know who's responsible for erm raising documents in the postal region.
Who's responsible for raising documents in the despatch department.
Or who's responsible for erm  received or going out.
Erm you actually  you know you don't have to say I'm .
You just equate  to save you time and effort and hard work and going home just feel like this.
Feeling like you know  your life.
associate that with you if you feel .
That means change  learn  loads of paperwork to sort out.
That's what we think when you say .
Asking questions asking questions .
All right Marion ?
Yeah.
You know  really weighted down with something that's really bothering you.
Because you don't think that you really are  through the motion.
At least when you think about  you start to sound like you  that's the problem with the job.
Is you've gotta be like that show  in the West End where it's gonna feel like the first time .
Erm what I'm trying to get  is you've got to start backing up from the sale er  the objective of that call is not to close the sale.
Is not to handle objections.
Is not to persuade them to change on that call.
Is to gather information.
Alison I understand you're the person who has to drive  information on .
So you're the one who really has to do er if the if the system doesn't suit you or if the system's hard work if you have problems .
I mean  interesting because I've never actually done the job that you're doing.
How  these names .
And that's the sort of question.
D'ya have  you know what's it in connection with.
Why are you  hard work.
And I don't know if  for you .
And you know what I mean?
If if people wanna know all you the benefit is saving half saving energy.
You know you  the hard work.
It's no use talking about cost savings to the girl  interested in how much it costs.
He just wants to go home  or having a  job and the despatcher needs to be established with the person who's actually gonna use it.
And get her backing or his backing.
If that's something you want us to is it something you  would that be an advantage to you.
speak to about this .
Rather than you selling it to the boss and then all the trouble .
You've gotta  the right person .
I'm gonna stop there but what has it we could spend all day and all tomorrow talking about detailed and  knowledge.
But what I'll try and ask you to do is your service level is not just four nights four noons four  despatch  you know it's not just that.
It's the it's the detail of it.
You need to know closely the detail.
Let's just run through a couple of the points.
Just tell me what you've got on your list there  that erm people have said .
That was another one  just of Warrington  despatch.
That's a good one.
That's what .
Belfast is in Northern Ireland part of the U K right?
Now when you are I want to talk to you about doing a sales call.
But before you do you've got to look at the material in the working file.
Look back  internally and now we've gotta talk about communication to your question  survey.
How do we breach what you do and how d'ya get there.
Will you what method do you use to to talk to our questioner?
What's the .
You do telephone .
There's different ways of communicating isn't there?
There's things like telephones .
Letters.
Letters.
Faxes.
Letters fax
Visiting.
and d'ya have a lot of ?
Yeah.
Yes?
Those are the those are the main ones.
Can you do me a little exercise first just to er write down write down what erm  of what we're trying to reveal.
Imagine now communication I'm talking about not only through letter and telephone I'm talking about  total communication.
If you were now talking to each other tonight round the table in the restaurant or at the bar in the hotel okay.
You're you're telling you're communicating with each other.
If I said to you the communication right these are the methods that this is what actually communication is.
If I said some of it isn't made from the words or the message some of it is made from the tone of your voice.
And some of it is made from body language.
D'ya know what I mean by body language?
Can you give me an example of your body language?
Pick up the phone and  smile.
No well that's not body language because he can't see you can he?
All  with a smile is tone of voice.
Yes would you agree?
What is body language.
You're staying you're in a hotel now tonight and you're talking what is body language?
I mean the way that you sit.
The way that you sit.
sitting like that
Right.
you're more likely to be  
That's right.
Obviously you know when you've been sitting still this is probably the worse hour of the day .
You've been fed and watered just like a new baby.
You've been fed.


it's hard to keep concentration right.
And your body language tells me.
It tells me the way you look you know.
Now all of a sudden I change the subject and look the way you're all sitting forward.
That tells me 


You can  from your body language what you're doing.
Your eye contact with me is body language.
We can we understand each other we're reading each other 's messages.
You're nodding occasionally when you agree with me.
you know that you're telling you're giving me messages.
Erm that's what body language is right?
You were even lip reading.
You don't know you do but you do lip read erm as well.
And if I said to you those three elements of communication that makes up the hundred percent of it yes?
That makes total communication.
Now what I want you to do is ask yourself don't discuss it just write down for me and I'll go round the table.
If I said to you how would you divide that hundred percent up between those three what value would you put on your message.
How important is the message?
To get total communication how much relevance do you put on the message?
Is it thirty three percent thirty three percent thirty three percent or is it all weighted one way or the other?
We're talking about face to face situation aren't we ?
Yes.
A total communication situation where you've got you might you've got use of body language you've got use of language you've got use of tone of voice and you're making you're getting the message across.
How important is those three components and what value would you put on them.
And I'll just compare what each of you say and I'm going to give you some information er researched by .
Although erm we haven't  we're running short of these papers but it's the same figures .
Sarah what was yours?
Well I've put erm  message 
Yes.
Er tone of voice fifty percent.
Yes.
And body language .
Right.
Now


Yeah well let me check that out.
Erm word I've put twenty
Yeah.
Tone?
Tone forty five.
Body language thirty .
Thank you.
Oh.
Melanie.
twenty five.
Yes.
Tone of voice twenty five.
Yes.
Body language fifteen.
Right.
Karen?
Erm words of message forty.
Yes.
Tone of voice twenty.
Yes.
And body language forty.
Right.
And Alison.
Words of message thirty five.
Yes.
Tone of voice forty.
Four O?
Yes.
And body language twenty five.
I've got words and message twenty.
Yes.
Tone of voice thirty.
Yes.
And body language fifty.
Right.
And  Marion.
Words forty.
Tone forty and body language twenty.
Right.
So you've got some differing opinions there haven't you?
Some of you  some of you heavy in bodies.
And er you're heavy in tone here.
Some of you are look at er relatively high words.
Research that  where they're looking at how to convey the message from advancing and sales and people getting erm interviews getting into jobs  what they say what they how they stand even how they've looked and so on.
They reckon that erm    Thirty eight percent is how you say it.
Fifty five percent is how you communicate through  what sort of .
But they reckon  proportion and we  when .
Well I'm not  researcher I couldn't say how they do it but it's done it was done from their recruitment and marketing sales .
And they put on every consultant through out training course  they got I think we've made I think we've got sixty five .
But they reckon when they did obviously it's a set that probably someone had to say the same thing doing or the same person went through so many functions and it was worked using different ways of saying .
So why I said to you on the telephone  as you say it's not what you say it's the way you say it.
What as as I said to you  twenty percent of the messages  a word sounds the same .
There's quite a few letters and therefore words sound the same .
And again destinations  er T N T.
T N T 
no no if you're not careful .
I wanna tell you the way  the word perhaps the one where .
It would be normal  well it must be what I've said.
I want you to do something now which is a little on the same  talking about how we .
And I'm going to write other  and I'm going to ask you to put a different emphasis on different words to change the meaning.
Okay .
Say that for me and go  I'd say it were you were a snob.
Say it as though in a snobby way for me.
Would anybody else like to have a go at that?more snobby than .


I mean really do it you know.
What else where where else can you say it if you wanted to talk about the exclusivity of .
Right can you demonstrate what I mean?
all the best.
We're all the best.
You're putting .
You're saying erm as if to say, Melanie you got the message across but by by excluding you you lot she said all the best people .
In other words if you don't  you're not the best people.
The way Lynne said it is where all the all the best people.
She's not saying er she she she wanted an emphasis on the word best but you've got the same .
Right.
Say it Mandy in a sarcastic way as though you don't believe a word of it.
Can you think about it for a minute.
Of course we'd never be sarcastic any of us would we?
all the best people.
That's right.
She asked it you were saying it Lynne and Melanie as though it was a statement of a fact.
What did M Mandy infer?
She was questioning.
Questioning yes.


more than guesses.
Pardon?
Oh right.
 

Right.
Erm say it as though you're not sure er you're not sure about it.
You're not sure of of where it is that you feel you might .
Erm you think you're questioning the the actual role .
You want to check information is correct.
What .
Say it thought you're not sure whether it's Cedar Grove or it could be somewhere else Cedar something else.
How would you say it then?
Go on  a bit louder.
That's right.
See how she inflects on a word?
Cedar Grove.
And say back to Sarah confirm that she's right but just use those words.
Confirm that she's right by her Cedar Grove .
Say that sentence back just to confirm that she's got that right.
Cedar Grove is the .
No you didn't say the word then.


Try reading this time.
Oh right sorry .
Good.
I know what you're brain's ahead of your mouth here.
Carry on again.
Cedar Grove is where .
Yes yes.
But she didn't want to know
Yes that's right she said that right then.
Cedar Grove is where .
I was thinking of the word Grove.
If you said Cedar Grove is where Cedar Grove is where the best people live.
That's right.
You know if you can just actually repeat it back.
And people do that to you don't they?
You say something  they say er, Oh erm I was paid I was paid today.
Oh you were paid today?
Don't they?
But they mean something entirely different but they say the same words.
I was paid today.
You were paid today?
Anyway.
Sorry?
.
What I'm say is is it's it's not what you say.
The meaning is not in the words it's in the way you say it isn't it?
If I say to you, Sarah I'd like a few words with you.
What can I mean?
Because you think what Mandy?
What d'ya think if someone says they want a few words with you what d'ya think's going to happen?
told off.
Told off.
Now to me I might want to know that people use language to mean more than one thing.
And they do it to to cause ambiguity.
They you know we create confusion because it it allows us to have control.
And we .
You know the tone of the voice could completely waylay you know lay lay completely your fear of being told off by the by the pleasant tone in your voice.
Yes.
It might be a meeting  not a telephone .
Might might be a constructive thing an informative thing.
What er do you ever have people you know perhaps people who are close erm dear to you who use certain language that you find erm er either  or do you use methods which say getting your point across to people that .
Well I do me and Jonathan erm they don't like me er  read all his books .
When I talk and the news is on John will always  it really annoys him.
That's it you do want that's all that's all body language 
Doesn't even speak  
No you don't have to.
just looks and I just
Non verbal communication.
Yes.
Non verbal that's why I know you think about body language but think of all the times things like that happen where the body language speaks it you know.
A raising of I have a brother who raises his eyebrows 


He he doesn't raise his voice he just looks just  or 


What about the way they say, Have a nice day.


sarcastic 
Thank you for .
Like Kath Kath er  trust me I'm a doctor.
Or are you on drugs.
I mean we use language don't we?
We say one thing and mean mean something else.
And we're quite good at being sarcastic.
Women are  really expert at it.
We've got it.
Because you have to be cutting with the verbal.
Because you can't wallop them round the head can you?
You've got to be a bit more er intelligent when .
If you justified me coming on  you know you can you can be a bit more you're being a bit more erm what's the word cerebral aren't you.
You're thinking more than doing and er wit you know sarcasm they say is the lowest form of wit but actually sarcasm probably is wit.
Some people think you know really be testing  er with language and mean something entirely different.
I mean sometimes do it very cleverly but what I'm saying is I want to illustrate what I meant by the words never used  message.
You know when we using the telephone method of communication what d'ya think why d'ya think we we we're employed with the company.
Why d'ya  decided to give some contact .
Yes.
I would say that plus qualities there's a good network .
But that's why telephone sales  because telephone  and the  to us and to them you know.
At one time we said it was you know  rewarded on the edge of technology when they  like most things you know.
Your brother probably paid a week's .
Some people can get .
At one time a  we'd pay a year's salary or two year's salary.
Now we can get something that would be half  affordable .
But cost to us if you paid you know  pay for girls  and also the procedure to er use the service is is much better now.
I I can write it  but when I  is what quick?
Quick.
Yes you think it's people expect it to be quick don't they?
You don't make the public phone 


.
Very cost  What I'm saying is it's quick erm people expect to do it it's something oh if they're writing instead of going round I'll pick up the phone and do it.
It's er an instant method.
So they expect it to be quick.
Anything else?
Yeah you
In our job 
Yeah why we would choose it.
That's erm it's two way obviously.
I mean if you're writing to someone er and it's instant that's a good point.
But then if you prefer it to writing they'll  postal strike you you know you hope .
And in fact the  like a mailshot  one forty percent on something.
Whereas contacts on the phone would probably be more er effective.
And I think it puts you at their  as well.
Because most people have a lot of  area it isn't like someone  reception  I've got a phone call for you.
Now when you're  often they phone up and say, There's someone here to see you.
And .
They actually have to come and meet the person fact to face.
They get post  land on their desk.
But they haven't got the instant feedback.
A  you have to actually you know make arrangements.
But you're actually at their desk right you know I'm here really.
You know it's a good method to get to know detail .
D'ya think?
Mm.
D'ya think it's harder  to talk to the person you can't get .
I think it's easier to get them when you're on the phone.
Like you said you can't see the body language and  fobbed off  .
Now now I agree with you there.
I think it's easier to get through but it's harder to hold  
Yes.
People get confused then they think, Oh when something I've got to  and I've to read all those messages  a lack of rapport really isn't it?
You're saying it's not not it isn't impossible but it's harder to generate a warmth over the phone isn't it?
We have to act more 
That's right.
And sometimes it's too quick yes?
It's too quick for what we want to try and do.
Because we never  Okay then thank you we'll call you 
That's right.
No  and that means erm you're blindfold really aren't you?
If you've lost your way on the phone .
So there's a it's it's got .
Anything else .
What don't you like that .
The fact that people do get a lot of .
Right.
So yes.
So  
That's  you say that's .
Yeah.
I think that you know a lot of people are sort of.
You think too many calls.
I would say that's interpreted as easier to  or easier dismissed.
Would you say er it's  important because  easily dismissed.
And you know I've had a lot of people say to me, Oh is it just a sales call?
Yes.
Is that the telephone's fault d'ya think or is that fault I mean  salesman coming in as well.
I mean a lot of times you know I think just phone up and say, Is mister so and so there and then  guard themselves  T N T delivery.
Oh he says a sales  you know .
Yeah.
He  because it's
Yeah.
.
D'ya think that could happen to you face to face as well though Lynne?
You were not coming strong.
Oh yeah definitely.
Yeah.
I don't I don't think it's too much to do with the telephone.
I think probably the saying aspect rather than telephone aspect .
But I accept what you saying.
Sometimes it's because it's so many people that are using this method that the importance of what you're trying to say tends to be dismissed  and therefore .
Sales means you're going to tell me you're going to persuade me to do something I don't want to do.
I think  and then we can pass them off then .
yeah?
Mm.
That's when they when they  calls for selling.
Yes  help line.
The help line aspect of it yes?
Yeah .
Yeah yeah.
That's good for us then isn't it?
Yes?
He's interrupting.
I think it can also be   I think  Have you never 
Well I have to do 
He says I don't want anybody to see me.
Cos he is this real .
I think I think I love the radio.
I love radio plays and .
I like the radio plays and I like erm er stories and you know book at bedtime and I love all those because it's like reading.
I was reading a book .
Have you ever read a book and 
Oh yes.
The illusion going completely and erm my imagination is much better is much more  erm and music is very erm inspiring for your imagination.
I always remember I had  Tommy  Ken Russell and he'd been on .
We both know the music very very well and the album .
I mean nothing could catch my imagination  fantasy.
Well where you get where you get  reporting from  foreign you know station .
And I agree with trusting you can you know the reality you what you're bound to  point.
You can't because people idealize and fantasize and you'll never ever even though you might be perfectly  and somebody else's dream but you won't be everybody's dream so you're bound to disappoint.
Or you'll leave it to the imagination.
Whereas your voice er is carrying all all sorts of wonderful .
Anything they want you to be you'll be you know.
And that's really I think a distinct advantage.
Just like  we can create an image that we want.
And I'll I'll do that and I'll .
But  it's a compliment it's a compliment from the company saying we've got a  looking people that we're quite  that people can you know .
Look what  at the conference .
Human bring a human face to people.
People like  we're a photograph.
What I  tomorrow and not here because they forward it on to us .
And they sent it to erm  he sent it  and he hadn't he hadn't done .
He'd sent a photograph in and he was sitting in the garden and right and he was on a garden chair  and he had his  nice hair washed and shiny.
Sitting in the  like that smiling you know.
And he looked liked really  just ready to get up and do his  lovely fresh face you know.
And he looked at the letter and he looked at that photograph and he thought, I can't .
And the photograph matched it sort of said I'm not the same  you know what I mean?what he said.
And and it really made it really gave the edge to that you know and and someone  And I thought .
I mean you know and and it  the eagerness oozed off the picture on the page.
And I think it can come out of the voice as well.
And erm I think what we've gotta do is you know .
If the image is something you don't really think is going to do as much for you as the voice .
Older women have a deep voice and it actually can sound very attractive.
And some people can change their .
You know you can .
And er I think that helps  and er they'll talk to each other you know .
And I have to talk to him on the phone and I'm saying  speak to him very well.
met him for the first time I think and erm   


I mean he's nice don't his wife doesn't  you know .
But he has got this marvellous voice and he .
I think I thought they've got no ideas  and then come on with  this speaker and I was  and I thought, Ooh.
And when I wasn't looking at it .
So I mean

The road was bendy and twisty with large shady trees on either side forming a beautiful avenue.
The road was bendy and twisty forming  which made it look beautiful.
It was a beautiful avenue.
I'm not very good at this at all.
It is it's really difficult.
I mean you've got you've made memorized those two lines.
I'm only memorizing one liners.
Go on.

She went to the local public baths every day before work and swam twenty lengths.
She went to the public baths every day and swam twenty lengths after work.
No.
No.
She went to the local public baths every day before work and swam twenty lengths.
She went to local 
Okay folks can we bring you back round 
before work and swam twenty lengths.
Can we stop you there.
We don't want to be all night do we?
We are gonna be all right.
Okay let's get  Even though it's fantastically interesting but er erm let me just get a bit of feedback from.
How did that feel?
Was it easy or
Oh a nightmare.
Oh what did  description.
Yeah.
What was difficult about it?
Let's just analyze a little bit what was difficult.
What did you find easy what was difficult?
By the time you remembered what they'd said erm
The first bit.
the first bit yeah you're remembering the last bit when you're remembering that you've forgot the first bit.
Cos by the time you said, What did I just say?
So it's the amount of information
Yeah.
Too intense to listen.
What d'ya mean by that Karen?
Well you sort of like say for instance erm we heard of  recent burglary .
You are thinking  burglary while she's saying, I'm .
So all you can remember is 
You're obviously evaluating the message
Yeah.
of the first thing and fixing that in your mind and then well you can't keep abreast of how much .
Anything else girls?
What d'ya you were saying Karen how d'ya have to how did you manage to do it?
You may just sort of er form a picture in your mind  just sit there and lip read  sort of concentrate.
Look at the floor  put a picture in your mind of what they're saying and it seems sort of.
What about getting the do you do you get the gist but not the details.
Yes.
understand the meaning behind the sentence but you couldn't  word for word.
Lynne was doing all the hard work.
We got down to number tend and they were all one liners.
And I was thinking, I can't even get these ones let alone the two liners.
Trying to repeat the same one.
Why were they hard 
Erm
on the  form that we looked at?
Erm no.
I dunno I I got the gist of what Lynne was saying and I was concentrating but maybe I was concentrating too hard because I was getting most of it right wasn't I but it
It's just odd words you sometimes
You switch them round.
you concentrate and you get it.
What about the language that they use?
there's a lot of er
Was it different to the way you would use it?
Yes.
Erm that erm we would normally use.
Terms and phrase 
But I don't know.
Things like that sometimes you can remember but because you don't use them so often you think, Oh that's strange.
But then 
And that's  in fact
Yeah but in an exercise like this you're thinking when they're saying that, Oh I wouldn't normally say that.
By which time you're not listening to the other things they're saying.
Now what do we do when we launch into our presentations on the telephone?
Try and get as much out in one breath and then just go  next  
and somebody says, Well the girl you know he says you never call you you never told him about that.
You said, I told him about that.
And you you discussed but he can't remember it.
I've told him about that.
And you do you can't go on 


You're expected to  to remember a whole process that you're asking to  you know explain how to fill in the form or use another system.
You're expecting them to remember it word for word as though it you know it's ingrained on their soul almost and can't  
Yeah I've found myself doing that sometimes.
You know if I start saying something I'm noticing myself think you know I'm taking too long to say it.
But I won't  sorry could you repeat that again.
Yes.
And you have to try and think it differently.
That's right.
What sort of skills would you implant er what would you do in order to take er note of the detail of that exercise .
What what sort of things would you do to break it up and absorb it in bite size pieces?
What things  how could you improve that retention 
Pause.
Pause you can pause  couldn't you?
What about the person who was listening.
What could you have done that would aid you remembering?
What's the obvious thing?
Emphasize the word.
Yes the tone of voice well done.
That helped a bit did it?
Yes.
So the pace of it you said and by pausing and er stopping and stopping going er too fast.
Giving them plenty of time to absorb.
Did you speak fairly slowly to help them?
Yes.
It's like you were speaking to a foreigner you know a French person or something.
I found I was trying to announce it  the I'd this and I'd that in there.
It was trying to like speak very clearly.
Yes.
Yes you you are teach related is the word yes?
You were very clear you were an  and I don't think Lynne even adopted a certain authority about the information when I heard her reading it out.
She sounded like a news presenter.


You were saying you do emphasize when you're trying to get people to understand.
You do.
Yes that's right.
But remember those these these things that you understand logic are logic aren't they?
They're just logical things to do.
Pause  pause speak rather slower than you would do if you were in a normal conversation.
Remember twenty percent of the message is lip read and you haven't got that opportunity.
It's understanding the  so speak slowly not not not laboured but just a little slower than you would do.
We all chat our heads off don't we?
We're we're all excited at this  of information that we want to pass the story across to .
Big  use inflection and intonation in the voice.
Clear clarity or articulation.
Speak clearly.
Use language.
That's what they said on that film didn't they?
That it's not the language  felt uncomfortable because erm it wasn't an expression you would normally use.
I know you can hardly be expected to adopt all your  expressions erm but you shouldn't be too technical in you know.
If you're talking about erm you know er L B Os and confinements and
Up-trading.
up-trading down-trading despatch you know.
I've just had a phone call in  I've just erm had a phone call from a conference company and she and part of her research the woman in  came on one of my courses to just see what the background  and what we were doing.
And erm she had she works for a erm  videos  set up conferences you know the sort of things that you've been on.
And erm if you ask for the despatch manager they say we haven't got one.
We don't have one.
Do you despatch any goods?
They say, No.
Because they're a conference .
If you use language that's alien to that environment it doesn't mean very much.
Who would who would be the person in a marketing and promotion  conference erm creative 
Designer?
What would the designer be?
Well he would would he he would design everything and then obviously it would be important for him to get it sent out.
So maybe he would arrange it?
Or the office manager?
Mm.
Yes usually erm someone manages the place somewhere .
Or even if you have to clarify the title by saying who is responsible for making sure that materials that you use arrive at the place that they're supposed to arrive at the time .
Who's responsible for your organization of that sort of backup.
You might have to be more clear about what you're specifically asking for rather than use handles titles.
You understand?
You may have to talk out functions of the job.
Because you don't what sort of title.
He he may say he may say head of creative creative head of create the creative department or head of erm .
We had in our  in the newspapers creative we had a creative department.
He was head of creative.
Now it sounds weird now something about I'm sure that's  but that's what we used to call him you know.
And there were there were artists who  the artist.
Only that  you know you're not you're not familiar talking to the artist.
But if they do story boards about videos they obviously illustrate and er or design stands or er or backdrops to er a setting.
You know they have a creative market .
But we might make a mistake with the title and someone .
But if you use the function who is responsible for doing then you can often find out who .
So you need to be careful of the language.
Is there anything else that you learned thinking of the exercise now listening when you put the shoe on the other foot  and you have to stick to .
What other things do you think could have helped you?
There's an obvious thing really that erm if someone dictates something to you and you have to repeat that word for word what would you normally do by  
Make notes of it.
Well done.
That's what I was tempted to do actually.
Yes it's it's a natural you you get an urge to make notes .
Make notes.
Well you make notes when you're listening to customers and  make notes when you were questioning me did I and it was hard to even if it's only four or five questions it was hard to pull together.
Or I can't do it I have to scribble.
I have to scribble.
Even if I'm like giving out my name to a customer sometimes I write down Lynne and it's like what did you write that for.
That's right.
Bearing in mind this is dumped after a week.
After  this is dumped.
We keep ours.
Do you?
What for?
I don't know.
Gets kept though if got like piles and piles of these.
Just in case.
It's kept  What I'm saying is it's it's a working document.
it's a working document.
It's for your  you can you know keep  make notes and er then  something to you.
shorthand it's all  shorthand notes.
I'm sure you do with your own  anyway and er if you can that will help you .
Is there anything else that's  support what you're trying to do?
What how d'ya get the   That's a difficult one really .
Shall we have a go at this?
No.
You talk about  if it's something you're used to you talk about something and you know what you're talking of and somebody a bit like actual 
interesting to you.
Yeah.
But  area of interest yes.
I was quite happy answering your questions quite happy.
Also
You have the hard job I have the easy job .
when you know more about what you're expecting to be told it's easier to remember it.
Whereas these things were just like anything out of the blue and it's like all what's what's coming isn't it?
So what you're saying really you ought to make a logical pattern of it yes?
It's got to
Cos most questions really you know that you're gonna say yes no even though like you said, Well maybe I do put it that way.
But we know really you could say yes .
Yes yes.
What I'm saying is if you keep a most people what that that's a bit that's a very very very good point Lynne about it they were all higgledy piggledy subjects.
oh god no sense was made of it.
And therefore your brain was trying to naturally put it into some context but it didn't go into any context so it was difficult  
So if you if you get them talking about something and they actually get talking about it
That's right.
and then you ask them something totally different and think, Oh weren't you interested in that anyway.
Yeah and the thing is you they don't forget that when you phone someone else they're doing something else.
And you just
talking about.
You've got to allow them to give their  around to where you are with how you open the call.
You've gotta say something interesting quite early on and just to bring the whole conversation to where you want it to be.
You talk about asking questions you talk about the product that you've got to  up to the question the problems that you .
You talk about leading questions again that  testing trial closed  where we'd just test the water before we go for the actual commitment.
Really what we're doing after are they prepared to talk about it if when you by consent let me carry on talking when you don't have a leading question.
What you going to say about something that's important  a solution for you is that something you'd like to do?
What have you got to say?
You know and then you're starting to present information after you've got their full attention not just from the beginning where you're trying desperately to win the  presentation forward.
Now what I'm a little bit concerned about is how you should grasp that attention initially.
Because I think you have a very tough job on the phone to do that and you need erm to start think about what is interesting okay?
What I'd like you to do this evening if you will erm as an exercise is you know you were talking about erm asking questions listening to the answers speaking the same language watching  erm talk the  language.
Like  first of all there's erm talk person to person  asking questions listening to the answers watch er talk person to person watch for signals and er talk the same language.
You remember what customer  talk person to person.
If you are thinking about it talking person to person  remember the guy on the building site remember the woman who's pregnant and  trying to sell insurance and getting him to  he should have been securing his family welfare and so on.
When the man in the wallpaper shop was he was tried flogging  floor tiles instead of concentrating on wall coverings and so on.
Erm he perhaps he remembered who he was talking to and what it was all about.
You know have to remember the person.
Now I want you to think about the person who he's going to talk to.
Right and I want you to plan to do that for a call tonight in order to what you would say to this sort of person all right?
Sarah I'm going to give you I'm going to give you a company call how we feel marketing.
Can I use your  for inspiration there Alison?
You certainly may.
Thank you.
I'll tell you what I'll do Sarah.
Ignore this can I can you are you working on these currently or can I use these?
Erm it is this weeks but erm I won't be calling in.
No all right then I won't I won't .
I've got mine here.
Have you?
Have you got ?
Tell me  if you're gonna work on there.
Anyone at all.
Has anybody else got their own  you have your own.
You've got some of your own.
Got any of your own girls?
No.
No.
Okay what I'm gonna ask you to do pick any one of these prospect leads.
Can you work on Alison's with her.
Karen you've got your own.
You've got your own Melanie.
Mandy have you got any ?
last week 
Doesn't matter.
Don't matter.
We'll use it just as an exercise again.
Imagination you've got the opportunity to do the call again.
What I'm going to ask you to then folks Lynne and Marion use one of Alison's just as an  form.
It doesn't really matter.
You'll have types probably similar on each of of your own printout.
I want you to think of the company you're going to ring.
Right?
Look at what the information on the pro on the prospect call thing that you've got there and I want you to plan an opening question.
Right?
I want you to introduce yourself  and I want you to say something interesting.
Related to the person.
The company or the person that you're going to ring okay?
Now when I say say something interesting what I mean is I want you to  pick something that you that T N T do.
You know this morning you were looking for .
You were looking at features like despatcher how you forward how you deliberate drivers and how good and how  extra mile and write out printed write out labels for companies.
And how we are the targeting comp how we are the company that specializes in certain industries because you've got you you do industry by phone mobile phone  area and medical supplies and you know your local  as well.
We're that sort of company.
What I want you to do you  my language when you first speak to me.
I don't want anyone to say, Do you use a carrier?
Do you use a carrier .
Where do they go to?
I don't want to hear that yet.
That's something .
I want you to attract my attention with a full introduction to tell me.
What d'ya want to know when someone picks up the phone.
You pick up the phone and say, Hello.
What d'ya want to know about the  on the phone  stranger.
What d'ya want me to do?
Who it is.
You'd like to know who the person is.
Give him your name.
What does that do when someone tells you who they are by name?
You can actually address the person rather than just speaking to mister customer .
What else did you do?
Well you've got a contact man.
He's someone you can go back to .
Yes I'm prepared to give my name I feel you know.
If I if I ever take an incoming call here right?
And then they want someone else's help or whatever else and er I can see that they're concerned that you know they have a concern or want something from me then and I pass on I  some action to take place you know for you know I've  on to somebody or someone said to him, I always give my name.
Say look it's Kath  if you have any problems ring us.
I will say to you this is a full time job .
You've got my name don't think we go away that you can't ring me up again.
You know if you if you come across something you need help with phone me.
I'd be I'm interested to know.
If I get it's my job  your success.
And if you're struggling my job is to help you overcome those struggles and I I want you to consider I'm here er as a service to you.
I'm not I'm not I'm here for you not you don't you're not here for me.
You know what I mean.
I'm working for you.
And that's what I want you to feel like Mandy I don't want you to feel that you've gotta do things for me.
I do things for you.
And I do that say that because I want you to be feel my commitment to what what we're trying to do here.
Now that's what you want when someone rings you up isn't it?
They say look my name is and erm so I want you to think about how and talking about the way we talked about doing calls.
Don't just do what you normally do.
If it's good share it.
But if you think  yeah that doesn't really achieve  achieving nothing  convincing feel that  call.
Think about how you could say who you are.
What could how could you explain what you're doing.
What you're role is in this company.
How d'ya explain that you know.
How would people understand the function of that thing.
How would  be persuaded or give them the right image.
We talked about image and Mandy was talking about  not preparing if we wanted  these pictures to go out because we wanted  erm create a not an illusion but a a perception of what was going on.
What sort of build-up d'ya want to give me d'ya want people to have of you.
You know.
Er of how would you get that across.
And then say something.
Ask me a question and engage me in conversation or make a statement that applies to me.
The customer that you're gonna choose on that B M S listing okay?
And let's just work on this independently will you.
Don't work on it together and come up with the same.
Work on it as an independent idea.
Don't worry about it.
oh my god this is absolutely terrible .
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
That's we're here to help you put the words right you know.
I want if you're struggling with it just throw something down and say, Oh gosh I can't  you know.
Bring it to the table and we'll work it out together.
But some of you will come out with some lovely ideas and they always do all you know .
There was one on the course erm Monday and Tuesday  about how they introduce themselves.
They didn't  telephone or indoor sales executive  indoor sales executives
Yes she did  did she?
Yeah 
No that's now that's what  is but she didn't say that she said er
She said something else didn't she?
I think she said I just had normal er I I can't remember.
I'm responsible for your accounts in this area.
Or I'm responsible for erm and she did  what she did rather than saying I'm the indoor sales exec or the the account handler or the telesales person who is or
The distribution in your area.
Responsible for the distribution in your area.
That's fine Karen.
Yeah that sort of thing.
It's how would you describe the per you know who Karen  is.
I am responsible for er and then tell me why engage me in something about me.
Don't tell me anything about you.
in what they do if you want to.
But I want you to then engage me in something about my business.
Talk my language talk person to person.
You're on my territory when you pick up the phone.
You're in my office.
Okay?
Have a struggle with it and we'll discuss the opening question tomorrow because setting the scene is often the way the tone of the whole.
They control initially and you know being feeling that you're part of it you're in charge of it can set the scene for the whole conversation.
And can you've got this  fear if you miss some of those .
And then like you did about the subject here er me asking questions on the subject you want to do.
Think of your first couple of questions about that company.
Right?
As soon as I'm going to be interested by what you first said and then where are you going to go to next.
Start start planning a strategy of questions to find out more.
Using the information on that that erm B M S.
Do not ask me what know already and go through this routine of  what d'ya do who d'ya do where d'ya go.
I don't wanna hear that stuff.
They're all  questions.
But if you have that information you may want to confirm it's right.
I know that you do this but am I right in saying you do this but and then move onto the question right?
Don't just it's additional information.
And don't forget I want you to demonstrate listening back through the open question through the  questions.
I want you to conclude with a leading question.
Summarize if there's a need there right?
Remember what she said on that video film when when he when she wanted to do it for too  holidays.
She said what would happen if you were ill?
What sort of question was that?
I know the company can't do without you .
What would happen if you were ill?
You're you're actually saying  what would would I be right in saying that there wouldn't er they'd have to  without you if you were ill.
But you you're asking in a more open way.
leading question don't you?
What would happen if you were ill?
Now that's the sort of thing sometimes you can't form those leading questions until you've heard the answers.
Like you couldn't remember we were going.
Couldn't really pull the leading question out the hat until you heard the answers.
But that's what I want tomorrow morning we'll be looking at your preparation tonight on your call and I want I want you to tell me at the end of each why you chose the route you chose right?
I want you to put across what you're gonna do and and ask a question  and then tell us why you chose to go that route.
What made you do it.
