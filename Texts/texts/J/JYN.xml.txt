think do it in a situation which invites this informal repertoire erm
Mm I mean I, I did, one thing last er a few weeks ago is that I er cos I m it's a  I do this market research  it's really boring
Yeah.
people are just looking for a diversion so erm 
Yeah.
I started up le let's a compile a famous lesbian list
Yeah.
and erm it started off with I suggested a few, you know, well know lesbians
Mhm.
and er then people were coming along and saying the woman in the sandwich shop  
 
she's not famous, yeah but she's a lesbian.
How do you know?
Mm.
How do you know?
Cos she's miserable.
And  laughing 
Oh right!
and she says oh, he said oh yeah I feel really miserable today, I feel like a right lesbian!
And he's 
Right.
really laughing at them
Mm.
and then someone said er they were saying people like er Peter Stringfellow
Mhm.
which, I've never heard , no but we don't like them.
Oh I see so it's still you know,i insults, you know, it's something, something to say about people you don't like.
And  the whole, we, we, we sort of 
Yeah, mhm.
and then someone said Barbra Streisand and then someone said she can't be cos she's nice
Mm 
and then  I said  
yeah.
I said what do you mean sh oh I didn't mean it like that I meant she can't be because I like her.
I went ha 
Oh right.
that makes it alright does it?
Peo 
Yeah.
people are sort of 
Well it's it, it's very much like, you know, a lot of things I've come across in everyday language where, where people, I don't know, er friends and relatives have found out that somebody's been gay, oh well I never thought it of him, he seemed like such a nice person as well
Mm.
you know it's almost as if it's like er you know a sort of negative thing to, to, to find out about somebody erm so erm  yeah I mean I think I, so I think you'll, I think you'll, you'll  of necessity have to try and do something which captures this, this sort of informal talk because as soon as people commit themselves to writing they're gonna be erm  they're gonna be 
On the defensive.
well not exactly g gonna be on the defensive because it's, I don't, it's, it's, it's no less, it's no less genuine, you know it's, it's part, it's, it's, it's a view that they can express in different circumstances,
Yeah.
it's like sort of a guy comes into lectures and, and, and he can be, particularly when talking about things like racism and disability, be quite liberal as it were, you know, and that kind of when you get him  down the pub all on his own er a quite different repertoire comes out so er
situational.
Yes it's very situational, erm I think, as I think human beings are so erm  so, so I think you, you're gonna have to 
So I've got to 
crack, go for the erm yeah
go in the pub?
yeah, yeah.
Sort of erm if you erm tt I don't know, in some way succeed in, in noting or recording or, or something erm you know whatever it is that people are doing.
Erm  mm so how, how did we get on to that?
Just remind me.
Erm
That was just I wa I wanted to get like some 
Yeah, yeah, mm.
kind of pilot of how pe 
Mm.
erm because a lot of this questionnaire
Mm.
is based on that people have got an i you know they, they sort of identify a gay person, I mean you, everybody 
Yeah.
said I wouldn't like to be in a room with homosexuals
Yeah.
er a lot of the time, I was talking to someone at er
Well in a sense how do you know you're not, as it were you know in many cases .
Mm.
Yeah well I was talking, I was talking to a friend and they said that, you know, there's some homophobic attacks and some of them just happen to occur because people are walking in a gay area
Yeah.
you know sort of ooh he's gotta be a poof so they er duff him up just cos he happens 
Mm yeah, yeah.
to be walking past a pub
Yeah.
erm and I was just thinking about erm how people actually label people  
Yeah.
So I mean maybe, maybe there's context, maybe there's the sort of situation oh this, this is an area where, you know, kind of this is an area that's full of poofs so he must be erm 
Mm.
sometimes it may be to do with dress, demeanour, mannerisms, you know, kind of again you know people go for  oh I don't know, I mean there's a conversation er I remember overhearing erm  with some friends in Leicester and they, they go to motorbike rallies a lot and erm er they were describing an incident where they pitched their tent at a rally and some blokes came up and pitched their tent next to them and they were erm two blokes had arrived together on the same enormous immaculate motorbike and they'd got sort of matching leather outfits erm
you know this is the sort of thing and really, you know, sort of cropped hair and enormous moustaches like yard brushes, or this is the story that was told to me, and, and then there was this, all this, all this chortling about why their moustaches were so lubricant, oh yes, er so, so luxurious er rather, I beg your pardon, and erm
Yeah.
you know kind of there's all this  quips about sort of semen making your hair grow and all that kind of thing erm you know so erm  it's, it's, it's one of these things that erm sort of erm kind of people, people s slip into on the basis of  you know th er as far as I could tell there was no sort of firm evidence that these blokes were gay or heterosexual apart from judgments made on their demeanour and personal appearance erm  you know but er you know it gave rise to a whole range of, you know, kind of supposedly humorous talk erm in that context erm  so  there's a whole range of things erm tt you know sort of talk and mannerisms and, and er, you know, kind of also gossip and suspicions about them, oh is he married  if not does he have a girlfriend, if not ooh I wonder if he's gay, you know, kind of things that we understand about people's relationships feed into it so
Mm.
oh there's loads and loads of stuff erm tt  which I think people can use flexibly in different circumstances, you know, depending on what information they have about somebody so 
Mm.
I mean I've got a rough idea of what the things are
Mm.
Mm.
I just wanted to actually, you know,
Yeah.
get it from, you know, what people do 
Yeah yeah certainly, erm I think that's er  that's good, well if, if you can, if you can access it er in some way informally or, or, you know, it's probably un unlikely that you'd get too much stuff in writing as you say but, you know, er it could be very er  productive and interesting erm  tt erm can that sort of thing, particularly if you can get it in terms of quotes from people, you can sort of, you know, make a project look quite nice because it looks like if you do all this, you know, sort of stuff with the attitude scales it, it's   er it gives you lots of nice numerical data but er 
Mm.
particularly if you can supplement this and, and show how it erm fits into the way people discuss these issues, you know here's some real talk, here's some real quotes, you know, er stuff like that, it can look quite  yeah, yeah, great.
Yeah.
I, I mean I want to actually put in some you know some real kind of, you know, rather 
Yeah, mm.
than just
Yeah.
qualitative stuff as well.
Yeah right, so er  yeah  so it's  anyway it's  it's difficult to know how you're gonna get it but er I wish you, I wish you luck in, in, in doing so.
Erm  tt
Well I'm, I'm gonna use some of the er I mean I've got some of the er I made notes of some of the quotes I got from compiling 
Yeah.
the famous lesbian list
Yeah, yeah 
And I can use some of those
Mm.
about Barbra Streisand
Yeah.
but I probably can't use her  will I be able to use names which 
Of course you can, yes, if it's, if it's 
Yeah.
celebrities, erm if it's, you know, individuals at work erm  you know er perhaps it's appropriate to use pseudonyms but erm you know with celebrities I mean people do projects about, you know, kind of soap stars and things like that and say 
Oh well yeah.
say what people have said about them so, you know, it seems to be much the same sort of thing.
Erm  yeah let's see if there's anything else I, I remember thinking when I, when I had a look through this erm  so er   yeah erm  oh great so 
 
Yeah, mm mm 
I mean there are some really ex extreme ones and 
Mm.
I'll just have to omit there.
Yeah I think, I think that's probably just as well because erm let's say  you know it's being answered by somebody who's gay themselves or lesbian themselves or you know kind of is, is heterosexual but has sort of anti-homophobic sympathies
Mm.
I mean you don't want to kind of put them off too much erm
Mm maybe you put people on their guard like 
Mm.
the, the christian erm the born again christian council I mean some of the quotes I got from people
Yeah.
things like erm
Mm.
homosexuality will er will lead to an increase in murders and sadistic er 
Mm 
sex crimes.
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean I, I
Yeah.
I couldn't use that.
Yeah.
I mean that's a, a thing that er I remember seeing a TV documentary and there was this bloke, I dunno if he was from the Terence Higgins Trust, I don't think so, but erm er anyway he was going on about this, this very thing that there's often  the homophobic imagination er has this sort of slippage between  you know, consenting adult activity and if you're gay, if you're homosexual then this probably means that you're also interested in seducing children, you're also interested in sado-masochistic activity er you're also interested in, you know, a whole variety of other, you know, things which 
But it's
you know the sort of er, the sort of disgusting to the straight polity erm 
it's it's exactly the same
Mm.
Mm.
thing if you think about is as it's used for drugs
Yeah.
you know if people wanna smoke a bit of pot then this is 
Yeah.
obviously gonna lead to sort of drug addiction.
Absolutely yes.
Yes there's this sort of escalation model
Yeah.
which is very powerful in, in, in, mm 
You start off drinking then you  smoke and you, yeah
Yeah, mm.
Yes, though it's interesting with, with, with things like er  alcohol and tobacco because they're, well at least partly legal, erm you know often there's quite a, a crisp Manichaean division drawn between them and anything that's illegal erm you know so that you know kind of once, once you start smoking dope you're on the slippery slope to er you know kind of  heroin and crack and all the rest of it 
crime.
yes and, and crime of course, yes, absolutely, erm  er  so erm  yeah er   yeah and go in thinking about the er thinking about the questions erm
I mean you didn't spot any that just look, you know, glaringly
I didn't spot any that er that were glaringly, do bear in mind that I read this quite late last night after I got in from that, that meeting I went to
Oh.
so erm er  I can't guarantee that I was totally compos mentis when I read it but er I'm 
Well I mean I'm, I'm just  
I'm just thinking, you know, mm 
I'm reasonably happy with them but I mean I know 
Mm, yeah.
you've sort of had a lot of experience of constructing things like this so you, you know, probably, I mean if I'm gonna make an error I think it'd be a glaring one.
Yeah, mm, yeah so erm  I think mm yeah I think, I think with something like this, with questionnaires really the, the, the acid test is actually trying to administer them and then you see the problems very often
Yeah.
erm it's very difficult to spot what's going to go wrong in advance and some of the things you suspect are dodgy nobody has any trouble with, some of the things that you  just didn't occur to you that would go wrong do go wrong, it's like, mm mm, yeah mm 
doing that that's why I thought I'd get, you know, a response out of people  
Yeah.
Yeah but erm well a absolutely, erm but er 
The thing is I've omitted I've omitted things like sin
Yeah.
homosexuality is a sin cos I mean I think that's tapping into religion as much as to
Yeah quite erm
erm
so er yeah 
I don't know what, I mean some people may, you know, may not even perceive you know  the concept of sin so I got rid of that
Mm.
I also got rid of anything to, that mentioned morality
Yeah.
Yeah.
cos I mean that's  
Fair enough.
to sex behaviour anyway.
Mm.
Yeah so let's see if there's anything I remember.
Erm  mm  yeah erm
I'm gonna also  sort of preface it with erm  instructions to sort of say okay look 
Yeah.
when the term homosexual is used it can be male, female  specified.
Right yeah, mhm, yeah yeah, fair enough, mhm.
so to stop too much confusion.
Yeah great and you can have a little spiel in there about sort of confidentiality and your views are important whatever they are and, and a little bit of blurb about filling in the  scale and, you know, the usual sort of standard stuff
Mm.
erm so er  tt I think the other thing that'll be nice if erm  er given, if the first years are filling it in er in about a week and a half's time, if we could  if you could try and bash some of the data in fairly rapidly so that, you know kind of before the end of term we can, you know, kind of give them a brief digest of how, what, what the results were
Yeah.
so that they, they're getting something back as well as 
Yeah I mean, yeah 
as er, as, as, as doing something erm but erm yeah it's certainly possible to er to do the first years.
Erm  yeah er  mm  yeah  no I'm quite intrigued myself about this, this idea that erm somehow it's heterosexuals who trus who are trustworthy and that, you know, once you have a sexuality that's different from heterosexuality then you can't be trusted with children and you, you know you, you can't be trusted to er  you know I don't know, run boys' clubs, you can't be trusted in, in a, you know, it's sort of, it's almost like, like erm  er  it, it almost flies in the face of evidence that the vast majority of sexual abuse that goes on of one sort or another is, is heterosexual, it's
Mm.
very often men abusing women and yet, you know, when you're looking at erm attitudes to gay and lesbian people it's often the case that they're, you know, somehow thought of as, as suspect.
Mm.
I think a lot of the time, I mean homosexuality has been perceived historically as like a, you know, if not an illness a weakness
Mm mm.
and er
Yeah.
people are told to go and have a cold shower and not give in to the weakness  
 
not give in to the weakness
Yeah.
so I think they recognize that everyone has homosexual 
Mm.
thoughts
Yeah.
it's just the people who, who sort of gave in to them were, were sort of weaker than other people
Yeah, yeah 
so if they gave in to that one temptation
Mm
they'll sort of give in to other temptations.
Oh right yeah, yeah
But it's like
and, you know, they'll be tempted to put their fingers in the till and, and pilfer from work and, and, and 
 
you know, all sorts of other things as well because they're, they're morally suspect, don't have the fortitude.
Mm.
Tt yeah  yeah erm  yeah I mean it's interesting when you come to attitudes to parenthood erm I think that's quite an important issue because it does tap into a whole range of things about erm  you know kind of er suspicions that somehow if gay or lesbian people raise children then the children'll either be, you know, sort of corrupted or converted themselves
Mm.
erm you know never mind that most children who are beaten or abused or die at their, the hands of their parents er you know, do so at the hands of their heterosexual parents
Mm.
erm you know it's still er you know, considered problematic.
Mm.
Mm.
version of  most gay people come from heterosexual homes anyway, so
Absolutely yeah and er  you know kind of er it's absolutely impossible to, to determine exactly what it is that's, that's, you know, propelling people's sexuality isn't it?
I, I mean 
You know, it's still 
I mean I yeah I included those because I thought a lot of pe even the sort of  most 
Mm.
right on people
Yeah.
are gonna have problems where children are concerned  parenthood.
Yes I think there's some, yeah yeah I, I think there's, that's one of the, the areas where  er as it were attitudes are most small C conservative, that er sort of liberal heterosexuals whom I know er you know are often quite suspicious of that.
Erm
And I usually say well once, once, once gay and lesbian people start beating their kids like heterosexuals I'll, I'll agree with you but erm  erm tt so er mm
I mean I know that there, there were
Mm.
I mean I did read somewhere there were some studies done
Mm.
er on the American sort of er gay 
Mm.
couples that have adopted
Yeah.
and the children were sort of actually more, you know,
Mm.
psychologically bal well balanced you know 
Yeah yeah mm.
as, as they define it
Yeah.
than the sort of the, a controlled  
Well I think I think growing up with gay or lesbian parents I think, I think could be a very mind broadening experience for people it will certainly teach you about social life in a, in a lot of different ways that er
Mm.
people in heterosexual families wouldn't find out about erm and it teaches you ways of dealing with prejudice and discrimination, on the assumption that you, you, you do learn to deal with them, and er
Mm.
all sorts of stuff like that.
Yeah erm  oh well looks like we're nearly drifting towards the end, again as I, as I say I'm, I'm, I'm fairly, pretty happy with the questions erm you know er going back to what I was saying earlier I was just thinking that some of them might be more  f easily phrased as non directional statements and you have the, you know, kind of have the words in the  scales yeah right, good, so yeah 
Yeah I mean I'm definitely gonna put some words  I think that 
erm as regards correlating things together and bunging them into the same factor analysis model and stuff like that er even if the questions are a bit different I think you can still do that legitimately because it's still sort of expressing the strength of opinion on some sort of scale erm so I don't see that that'll er interfere with the ambitions you've got as regards the data erm  so er
Mm.
anyway I'm afraid I haven't sort of scribbled anything on that but you know kind of that's er 
No that's quite good enough, that's good.
you know just, just thoughts I had as I was reading through it as best I can remember them so er mm 
But I mean this one I'm, I've got  I, I would feel comfortable knowing that I, I was attracted to  
Yeah.
so I put if I was attracted to my
Er how, how or something like how would, how would you feel if you felt attracted to a member of your own sex or something yeah, yeah.
Oh you'd you'd ask it in the form of a question?
And you can bung, you can bung some bipolar adjectives underneath it of one sort or another er 
So I mean  questions as opposed to statements.
Er yeah, yeah, yeah erm
Okay that's great.
I know when, when  invented  scales back in the early thirties er typically they were declarative statements which people had to agree or disagree with erm but er I think perhaps more recently people have gone more for things that are a bit like  how would you feel, what do you think type statements erm so er
Mm.
erm
Yeah I think that'd break it up and I think 
The erm mm 
it'd be a bit boring with just the agree or disagree.
Yeah, fair enough, so
Right that's great.
okay right so best of luck to you anyway if you 
okay 
sort of get that er sort of er get a, a neat copy run off we might be able to get it down for repro to reprographics in time for er Tuesday week with a bit of luck 
That should be no problem at all.
Yeah good.
Okay cheers, thanks a lot for your help.
Okay?
Cheers.
Oh hello.
 
Ah hello erm do come in.
Yeah right oh well, now then  now I'm afraid erm I'm doing a project for the British National Corpus which involves er trying to record everyday conversations so I've, I've got a microphone on, I hope you don't mind.
Er
  
Oh well never mind erm but, but, you know, informal consent and all that kind of thing so er right anyway erm  so er how's it going?
Well I've been told, well I I was gonna come and see you anyway
Yeah.
I'm a bit behind in my coursework and whatever 
Yeah.
well, I'm a bit behind full stop.
Yeah.
So er
Just to
Mm.
So  what s what, well let let's get on to something a bit more s as it were specific, I mean what sort of things are you, are you behind with and having difficulty with then?
Erm  well I'm still on stuff from last term.
Right.
Yeah.
Which
Er well it's just I'm ha it's not that I'm having more difficulty with one thing than another, it's just that I haven't, I didn't get round to doing them.
Yeah.
Yeah erm  is that gonna be a problem that's gonna recur in the future do you think?
Or  do you 
Erm 
do you think you'll be able to get sorted 
well  to be honest
Yeah.
I find it quite difficult like
Yeah.
everything.
Ah right.
Yeah.
Erm are there any specific areas of difficulty like you know sort of things like statistics, things like, you know, erm  I dunno, other bits and pieces that er you know give you particular problems?
Er   subject itself
Yeah erm
I'd just don't know how to go with it, I dunno what to do.
yeah erm
I'm  I'm alright on stats
Yeah.
It's  what, what were you doing before you came here?
Was it, was it like A levels or er  
Erm well I I'm a mature student
Oh right.
but I've had a few years out
Yeah.
but er er
Yeah.
you know.
I think that's not uncommon actually if you, when you get people who've, who've been away from the education system for a f a few years and I think it's almost like mature students do have more anxiety than people who come straight from school generally speaking I think erm
Mm.
you know more likely to  worry about work, more likely to feel that they're, they're not quite coping, more likely to feel erm  you know that, that somehow everybody else is getting on with it and, and, and, and they can't, I mean that's just, you know, going from what people have told me so 
 
so it's more, it's more, oh right
Yeah.
but sometimes actually it's a more, you know, kind of it's, it's, it's not really because they've got problems but it's just because they, they're, they're, they're sort of more diligent and more, you know, more motivated but erm yeah getting on to 
What more motivated?
Well in some cases, in some cases it is, I'm not saying every time but
you know I mean sometimes it is erm  so, I mean is there anything that you think, you know, we could change or you could change to, to like improve the situation?
So, you know, is there anything, is it about the way you work, is it about the way the course is taught, is it about  you know sort of reassurance and pastoral type stuff, is it about, you know, what?
All of them I think  but seriously 
All of them.
Er mm 
it's that erm  erm originally I couldn't get like the motivation
Yeah.
and I had trouble like er  cos I come from like, I've got like science
Mhm.
and physics and all that sort of stuff I mean I 
Yeah, yeah.
haven't written an essay for like a
Yeah.
I mean you're talking like  I mean years, I mean really it's 
Mm.
I can't remember the last essay I wrote
Yeah.
and I really have problems
Yeah.
with that sort of thing
Mm.
and er I just haven't  it's like erm I just haven't put the time in
Mm.
I just haven't been able to motivate myself to put the time in
Yeah.
I've ch that's changing a bit now cos erm
Mm.
yeah I'm ge as I'm getting into the course like I've gotta realize that I've gotta do it but
Yeah.
er  it's just not knowing where to go with it
Mm.
and er the stuff that I write is just rubbish, basically.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Erm  well I mean that's the  you know one of, one of the things that er  a lot of people contend with.
I mean some people adopt the approach of trying to d do it all in about two hours just before the deadline so they don't have time to feel self critical erm I think perhaps if you can, you know, rather than, rather than trying to do it all at once I mean the business of, of going through successive drafts of things and gradually getting them better and better, I mean the first drafts of things that I write are, are usually just scribbles on the back of a piece of paper that's, with something else on the front
Yeah.
they're usually just notes, they're usually ill formed and  not very well backed up and ill thought out and then gradually you know you sort of go through it again and you can fit more detail in
Yeah.
and gradually you can go through it again and sort of fit the references in and, you know, so gradually, and then, then you find it's too big and then you sort of go through it again and try and knock some stuff out so
Yeah.
I mean often actually producing pieces of writing is, is, is quite a, you know, sort of long drawn out sort of er iterative process I suppose in, in mathematical terms erm you know you kind of go through it again and again erm I mean that's one thing you ca but obviously that's quite time consuming er 
Yeah.
so er  erm and don't forget in the first year all you've got to do is pass
Yeah  
erm it's just a qualifying year, yeah well everybody says that but you know it's worth 
 
bearing in mind that you've 
Yeah.
just gotta put something in that  in the coursework and the exams that sort of gets you over the forty percent barrier and in psychology it's not that difficult to sort of waffle your way up to forty percent erm  without wishing ma to make it sound too easy erm
it's not like my brother did in his physics degree where he sort of ended up getting twelve percent overall in his second year and then took the year again and got six percent erm that's very difficult to do in psychology erm
so er mm but, you know, so er given that it's a sort of fairly discursive thing it's, it's, you know, it's probably, in some ways it's probably less difficult than you think.
Erm yes 
Yeah but I mean I think the stuff, the stuff that I've written is like rubbish, it's like  I dunno
Yeah.
it sounds like something you get on
Mm.
you know like television progra you know the really sort of 
Oh right, yeah.
chatty type stuff?
Mm.
I just ca I just  I've never done psychology before you see and so it's like erm
Yeah, yeah.
there's no, there's no er sources to it and I mean it's just like 
Yeah, mm.
Yeah I know it's  well again, you know, kind of once you can see, once you can see what's wrong with it rather than just sort of, you know, screwing it up and throwing it away, you know kind of if you can use that as a basis for, for, you know, kind of putting more of the stuff in that makes it look a bit more academic
Yeah.
erm you know kind of er call that a first draft and then sort , you know, sort of try and  sort of go through the books again and stick a few references in to back up the points you've made so you can see it relates to other people's evidence erm trying to go through it again and  knock out the  well you know what I mean kind of statements and, and, you know, you can gradually sort of make the er  grad you know sort of but again it's, it's, it's one of these processes that I find, you know, you need to go through again and again and again to sort of get it er get it together erm   so erm 
What shall I do about the stuff that I haven't done?
Erm  well I'll  if you could, if you could do me a list of, of what you've, what you've missed so far so we know where we are as it were erm what er mm 
I need two on 
Mm.
I need two by the end of the term.
Yeah whi which, which 
and  
which two
I did the erm tt  er what's it called?
Erm 
Well there's that tutorial essay thing possibly 
Yeah I did that one 
Yeah
and I did the erm  the one about the information crisis.
Whose tutor group where you in?
Erm Mr .
Oh right.
Have you had that back yet or er
No.
No.
Oh right well I'll erm  er  see er I'll, I'll see if I can catch Ian and, and, and see what, see what's happened to it
It's bullshit.
Oh right  oh well, not to worry but mm yeah but you know 
I mean cos it was, it was bad actually I mean I actually  
kind of if you do, if you do manage to get some, some feedback on some of the stuff you've done so far it may turn out that it wasn't as bad as all that, you know
Yeah.
it may turn out that it hasn't failed miserably but, you know, there may be various ways in which you could improve it which you might, you know, if you're lucky he might have sort of written on, round the sides and round the edges and erm that's you know kind of one of the things that you can build on erm you know a lot of 
 
you know kind of build on, build on the criticism as it were and build on the things that people say could improve it erm
Yeah.
and er you know I think coming to a, a university is a thing that  you know like it's a very sort of novel experience for a lot of people and you know certainly when I started  the human psych course here, you know about twelve, thirteen years ago erm you know I didn't know what on earth was, was requ required and I agonized over work for quite, quite a long time and er
Mm.
you know it's not  too uncommon but you know it's just a matter of
I don't know what it is though it's  
kind of ge getting something in that er you know sort of satisfies the requirements of the course and most people gradually the hang of it, you know
I think I will.
What are you supposed to  what are you supposed to do with things like erm you get ess you get lectures
Mhm.
okay and then erm it's, it's like  like some lecturers give you like a set of notes
Mm.
Mhm.
and some lecturers give you a set of references
Yeah.
so  and you just end up with a list of names or something like that
Mhm.
and er are you supposed to go back and like research it yourself or  
Well erm in some ways I mean what we're doing in, in social say, most of that you can pick up out of the  textbook where it's discussed in, in rather, slightly more detail and I  stick in, you know, different kinds of examples and things like that to try and
propel it along and make it a little bit different to the book erm with some of the other things, I mean for example if you erm get stuff off, I don't know, for example people like Ian  erm
Yeah.
erm  with him I mean he doesn't tend to give handouts but you know kind of if you write ever if you succeed in, in, in taking fairly good notes erm
they're very often good enough to like survive on erm
Yeah.
er if it's  people give you things like reference lists and reading lists, I mean sometimes that's the most confusing thing to be given because you don't know, I used to think you were supposed to read everything on them er and I actually tried doing that once or twice and I couldn't find stuff in Aston library so I ran up the er town library and went to Birmingham University library and then I got back the next week and I realized that I was about the only person who'd actually done that and  other people hadn't  
Yeah.
and erm  you know it was erm er
Too busy.
yeah, absolutely, erm I think partly those things are to in when people pump out loads and loads of references, partly it's to indicate which studies the ideas, information, evidence have come from
Yeah.
so they're not just making it up out of their heads, it actually, you know, somebody really did a study on this, somebody really put this argument forward erm er partly it's to, I mean some of the things on those things you can't easily get in Aston library anyway, some of the things erm er particularly if they're references to general, you know, sort of, you know, general bits of the, you know, whatever textbook they seem to be using mostly erm 
Yeah.
you know that's the sort of thing you might want to read as, as kind of background supplementary material and particularly 
I find it boring to  
Oh right erm but er well you can, you can get away without, without buying stuff erm  I mean as I, as I say some people do end up sharing erm some people do end up, not that there's very much library stock very often but, you know, some people do 
I've noticed that 
I couldn't get any of the erm
Mm.
course books like I think, I can't afford to buy them then
Yeah.
er you have to use other books  
Yeah.
Erm again  you know with the subject matter, provided you can find stuff that does tend to cover the same sort of s topics erm it doesn't really 
the  course is so like geared to like one textbook, you know 
Mm.
most of the time
Yeah.
and I, I can't get hold of that textbook and then, and not knowing psychology before
Mm.
you end up with like all these books and they've got a different, different sort of er  perspective on it and they've got 
Mm.
Yeah.
and they go into it in like different depths or  
Mhm.
and, and you just end up with  tt you don't, you can't follow it
Yeah, yeah.
and I, they do a bit and then another one, you have to go into another textbook
Yeah.
and er it's just like, I just lose it totally.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah I, I suppose it is a  tt it is a bit of a problem erm particularly for some of the stuff which  you know it, it tends not to be dealt with very, very deeply in sort of general textbooks like some, you know, erm I think things like  er some of the, you know some, some of the stuff that erm ah for example er people like Rob  do erm
Yeah.
it's difficult to access that in general textbooks
because it's often quite specialized
Yeah 
erm some of the stuff that we end up doing in the second and final year you don't easily access through general textbooks because it's quite specialist
Yeah.
erm some of the stuff that you might be doing in things like perception and stuff like that erm
Perce yeah perception  
yeah  it might be, I don't know, I think usually Roy does that but I think Dave's doing it this year or something erm er that tends to be, that tended to be something that I had difficulty with as a student because again you couldn't just sort of find one book that, that covered the lecture course
Yeah.
erm
You have to go to like ten different 
Yeah yeah
and most of the good ones are gone and it's like the nineteen thirty 
Yeah.
ones left in the library.
Right yeah erm so that can be, that can be a bit awkward but still some of the older stuff can give you a bit of a grounding in, in, in, in, in, in what it's about if you can find anything relevant and sometimes you've just got to sort of wander round the library and pick things up off the shelves like at random and see, see if you can find something in the index or find something in the contents pages that sort of vaguely coincides with what the  you know what's been talked about in the class that week erm sometimes if you keep looking you might actually be dead lucky and find one of the recommended books has actually come back in erm  you may find that you've got to be a bit flexible about that because, you know, if a topic's dealt with in November you may not get a chance to see the book until  you know kind of, I don't know, February or something, you know I mean  so it, it sometimes does mean you've got to do the reading like a bit displaced from the  from the classes
Right.
erm  I know it, I know it, I know it's, yeah mm 
 
I, I know it's a, I know it's a problem with big, with big classes and, and, and few resources erm so er
I've got few resources, I just can't afford to buy the books that's the 
Yeah, yeah 
that's the thing.
so  erm
I'm just so behind I can't believe it, it's like
Yeah.
all of the first term went ah just like that
Yeah.
cos I was working as well that term.
Mm.
Are you, are you self funding or er
Yeah
oh right
so it's like I'm working like 
yeah that makes it difficult as well 
God knows how many, although I'm not working any more I've lost the job but
Yeah.
I'm looking for another one but
Yeah.
so only like, I've had the last week off
Mm.
and I've er done an essay
Mhm.
but I can't afford to go on like that you see
Yeah.
and I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Mm.
I've got all the 
Yeah.
other studying as well as the work to do.
Yeah erm  well that can, that can be difficult erm I know er  when er when Dave  did his psychology degree here erm he started out as an electrical engineer and he got interested 
Yeah.
in psychology and chucked in electrical engineering and started a psychology course and he had to work at the same time as he studied for some of that time
Yeah.
and I don't know how he managed to fit it in er but some people manage it erm it means that sometimes you, you know, you're very time limited on, on, on writing things and you don't put in something that you feel does justice to yourself, you know, you put in what you think of as crap and, and you know mm 
I'm just not, I'm not bothering with coursework
Mm.
cos I mean there's loads of  
Mm.
like everyone like you talk to someone and they're like throwing up all the technical information
Mm.
sort of jargon and you think well  it's like cos er er they're 
Yeah.
all starting to get into the
Mm.
sort of knowing what it's about now
Yeah.
even the people that didn't know before  
 
did the A level and that cos like a lot of  A level
Mm.
but the people that like are new are starting to sort of oh, you know
Yeah.
oh that's the work of er  
Oh yeah they can say the say the, say the names and the dates and the, yeah, mm 
Yeah and I'm thinking well
yeah.
I'm gonna have to do some work on this and then erm
Yeah.
when it just comes down to it and I just don't know where to start
Mm.
it's like  last term I didn't get anything and it was like 
Mm.
I got very little notes and it's
Mm.
I just need like   
Yeah.
you know is there somewhere that I can get the subjects that I need in, in each
Yeah.
lecture just like 
Well erm 
and all that?
not, not very  easily because there's different things apply to different courses like some things have got quite a lot of sort of documentation and handout materials some things 
Yeah.
haven't erm er  and erm  you know some things you, you know there's the sort of one particular textbook that covers most of what we talk about in the classes, some things there isn't
Yeah.
erm  so I mean for example with something like statistics that covers different techniques and activities from, you know, different books erm something like erm something like social most of it comes out of that  which is a thing we did because people were experiencing difficulty with it so we thought well right we'll, we'll, we'll sort of anchor the syllabus mostly to, you know, one particular book erm  so different, different staff use different techniques, some people ha have drawn on a whole variety of things and, and, and some people have just drawn on one erm I think the main priority is to try and do some coursework though in your case erm
You reckon?
Yeah, if there's still stuff outstanding just so you erm
Well there's only one
Mm.
I've done one
Mm.
but it's like er  it's the one for Guy about memories and
Oh right, yeah.
it's a bit erm it's awful but erm
Mm.
I dunno whether, should I go and see him or hand it in or what?
Well I'll tell you what if you want to yeah, if you, if you want, well do, do have a word with him if you possible can erm 
Yeah.
er I think, I know he's not around very much at the moment because he's supposed to be on sabbatical but, you know, erm do 
Oh yeah.
do, do let him know er because if we  if we sort of know  you know if, if, if a, if an essay just comes in off somebody we've never met or something like that
Yeah.
and it comes in late we're, we, it  doesn't it ins it doesn't make us very sympathetic but you know if, if, if, if people know who you are and, you know, you know they know you've ha they've had a conversation with you then it, it makes it easier
Mm.
erm you know even if it does come in late so we can say oh yes I remember this person sort of thing, you know
stuff like that.
How about, how about coursework which isn't actually due in yet like stuff for the end of this term or the beginning of next, I mean do you reckon you'll be able to have a, have a stab at that some time?
I haven't started  I haven't started  
Yeah.
Yeah I'll give that try but I've got this other 
Yeah.
this practical for Dave in from last term
Right.
that's  that's like
Yeah well
that is.
as I say if you could erm if you could some time soon drop a note off in my tray about, you know, kind of what exactly you've got outstanding so I can go round and see the erm see the people concerned and, and say that you've been to 
just the one thing  
Well mm well you, you can but it'll be nice to, it will be nice to have something, something, you know, kind of some sort of list we can, we can refer to and, and say oh yes oh great he's handed that one in now and, and sort of knock it off because I know they do keep records in the office but, you know just, just something so, so we know where you are erm and it also kind of er will perhaps help concentrate the mind on what you need to get done erm  so er
I know there's a  
and there's also 
practical  is, is  
Mm.
I'm just 
Yeah now that's, that's probably worth mentioning to Dave because I think one of the things he was talking about doing was instead of one of the tests or something making people hand in either some sort of lab book or some sort of record of the practical so far this term erm 
Yeah I hate practicals.
Yeah.
So erm that's, if you're, if you're getting behind on that it's worth trying to do something about it soonish before you get too far behind to manage to catch up
Yeah.
erm  because that's like a continuous thing erm  with  with some other stuff, if it's just like essays or projects due in at the end of this term or beginning of next, you know get, get the light stuff out of the way first erm and try  you may find it easier if you, if you, what I used to do was sort of try and, you know, pace it out a little bit and not try and write an essay all at once because I found that very difficult to do but if you just sort of write a paragraph and do, do something else for a bit and  you know kind of write another paragraph a bit later on in the day and, and, you know, kind of erm you know work, you know don't, don't try and write an essay all in one evening but try and sort of, you know, if you've managed to spread it out over the course of a few days so that you don't have to do too much at once I mean it's  difficult to concentrate on one thing 
just so behind on the coursework
Mm.
Yeah.
and  take the notes and that
Mm.
cos erm  I just need to do some work on that, I've still got last term's work and everything, I just
Yeah.
you know what I mean?
Well it is possible, it is possible  because erm  you know we're not necessarily dealing with anything that's horrendously difficult this year erm 
Yeah.
I think usually most people find the second year more intensive, there's more work to do
Yeah.
and the final year I think there's sort of less on the timetable but people tend to do more work for it and do a project as well but in the, in the first year erm you know it's not that difficult to, to pass it erm  er  and there are always the, the, the referred papers in September so if you're, if you're keen to 
 

well you know if, I mean if you're keen to keep on the course but just having a few difficulties
Yeah 
then you know it's probably  it's probably possible 
possible yeah
but erm you know I mean some people do actually get total, totally pissed off with the university and the course and everything and, and decide to chuck it in, you know, er in which case 
I've done that before though.
Mm.
Oh right.
Where did you, where did you, where were you before?
Erm I was at Manchester doing physics.
Oh right, mm.
And I couldn't stand physics, I just sort of 
Yeah I think that's what happened to my brother actually.
Yeah  can happen.
Yeah.
So
Mm.
So I can't really er but I like this course as well,
Mm yeah oh well if you find, you know, there's anything you like about it or anything interesting in it that does help because it, you know, it certainly makes it a lot easier to learn things, take information in, revise things erm  whatever.
I do think it's interesting but I just er
Mm.
it's like say, say I, say I fin say I go from here now and I  
Mm.
Mm.
I think and I think well I've got this one practical to do and I've got erm 
Yeah.
Yeah.
which I can get done and then I've got 
Mm.
all this coursework that I, all this er lecture stuff that I'm behind on, lots of it
Yeah.
and I don't really know where to start
Yeah.
to be honest I don't
Yeah erm  tt well if I was you I'd probably try and, and keep up to date with the stuff that's happening now
Yeah.
and then gradually try and re don't, don't spend too much time trying to reconstruct the past because that, you know, you just get further and further behind with the present stuff so you know kind of try and at least make sure that, you know, maybe if you get a job you won't be able to go to all the classes but at least make sure you, you are in contact with somebody who has that you can get notes off every time, you know, that erm  oh hello
Hi can I come to 
hello can you 
to see you later?
Erm how much later?
Are you very busy?
Well
Erm let's see er
whenever you're free  
er let's see, it will be this afternoon some time, erm
Yeah that's fine.
if you could try me about sort of some time between three and four
Okay.
I should think because I'm doing something with some students shortly and then erm there's somebody coming to see me at two so er
Right I'll come up then.
Thanks.
Okay right.
So  yeah erm  so erm  tt  er yeah so oh that reminds me I think I may have left something in the lecture theatre I was in this morning, oh my God it was a letter from somebody  yes I have, oh shit!
Oh dear.
Erm do you mind if I leave you for a second?
I'll just nip back and see if I can get the thing.
Erm   Oh excuse me.
people  right thank you   Hello.
Hello.
Phew, just had to burst into somebody else's class and get my er  thing back.
Right, yeah so erm  you know I mean that's probably the best thing to do if you try and, try and at least keep up to date with the rest of this term and er you know not er  make sure, even if you haven't been to a class at least you know what went, went on there from somebody
Yeah.
erm so er 
Right.
yeah I think that's probably the best thing and gradually the past you've missed might start fitting into place as it were you know if you, if you keep up with the present, I think that's probably the best thing so er and, you know, er I know it's no comfort but these things take time, you know it takes time to get socialized into something and it takes time to get used to a way of working.
Yeah  well I mean most people do, I mean
Yeah I think I mean I will but
yeah, so er  so
I've gotta go and see someone else, who else should I see about this?
Well er if I was you if you're, if you're missing out on stuff from, from Guy try and see Guy, if you're missing out on stuff from Dave try and see Dave
Yeah.
erm if erm  have you seen, seen Ian  since those tutorials at all?
No.
Well you might want to go and ask him  er about it because he'll be presumably your, your, your personal tutor as well so erm you may be able to get some  more er you know, some, some, something off him you know kind of what he thought of your essay or something like that
Yeah.
because I haven't seen any of your written work so I can't really sort of erm er dispense any advice yet er
Okay.
so erm er or indeed it may be if, if you ask him or if you ask in the general office it may of erm tt it may have it may have been marked by now and so er
Could be.
you know er
Right.
but er  anyway as I say see, see, see the people who, whose work you're late with so er
So where can I find Guy then?
Guy lives on the sixth floor in  let me see, it's on the  it's  if, if you're going along the corridor it's just past the final year notice boards, it does have a number, I've forgotten which one it is but it's on the right hand side.
Dave is further down the sixth floor corridor, it's almost directly under this room
Aha.
and it's er the end on the left hand side if you go in there's like a little sort of  little sort of lobby and, and  Dave's is the little room sort of straight ahead of you, it's about down there somewhere
Yeah.
as the, as the woodworm crawls I suppose
erm so erm  yeah so, so  you know kind of get in touch with the people whose work you've missed and, and er, you know, er so at least they, when it, you know, when it does arrive they'll know  what the circumstances are so er
Do you actually fail the year if you don't hand in a piece of work?
Erm let's see, usually what happens is there's an exam board in June after people have hopefully done all their coursework and, and done their exams and then we decide what to do with the people er  you know who've failed something or there's stuff missing
Mm.
erm usually if it's just one or two things people are offered the opportunity to submit a piece of work over the summer
Aha.
if it's just like one exam or two exams that they've failed or they've  been ill for or they've missed or something they're offered the opportunity to sit those in September  then we have another exam board in September
Yeah.
and see what the situation is then.
Usually most of the people who've had coursework and exams to do over the1561
Yeah 
erm  then er  then, then what do we do?
Erm then we wonder whether to offer people the chance of, you know, offer them a resit year or whether we want to ask them to withdraw  asking people to withdraw is very rare actually, I haven't seen that done very often
Oh God.
so er usually people, people do, people do leave but it's usually because they, they, they're  they're sick of it or you know they, they want 
Oh right.
to do something else elsewhere or they want to transfer to transport management or something like that as people do sometimes 
That's an idea.
Yeah.
Er  yeah and I think people in the first term are quite attracted to it because it doesn't seem to have much on the timetable erm
What transport management?
transport management, yeah, erm anyway erm  so well if you, if you can  well if you can give me a list of, of what's outstanding, if you can see Dave and you can see Guy
Yeah.
er for the time being and if you ask Dave about this thing you've missed and also about what this business about erm cos he has explained it to me but I'm not quite sure about it, this business of keeping a, a sort of l record of all the practicals for this term
Yeah.
cos if you've missed the first couple of weeks' worth or so erm
You only have to do eight out of ten.
Oh eight out of ten, so there's still, there's still time to er
still time to redeem yourself, good
Yeah that's no problem.
Okay.
Oh well you already know about that in that case erm 
I know what I've gotta do but it's just doing it  
Yeah, yeah, yeah so er 
erm when do you want, where do you want me to put this list then?
Er well if you look in the general office erm just in 
 
on the sixth floor yeah erm it's, there's a load of plastic trays erm
Right.
for leaving messages for staff and stuff like that, mine's the
Will you know who I am?
er mine's the top one it says erm well I'll, I'll reme I'll rem I'll, yeah, well it just says  on it and it's the, it's the top one on the left hand side as you're facing them
Okay.
it's the one nearest the door
So what you just want my name and  
Your, your name and what you're missing, yeah.
Alright no problem.
So er so we can er we can see where we are as it were 
Alright then  
Right  okay well  mm, yeah Jenny's, Jenny's quite good about that sort of thing, she seems to be er be quite on the ball about who's handed in what erm 
Yeah she does  
yeah but er yeah there, there's a gre there's a great er it's a great shame actually erm we may not have Jenny for very much longer, they may not renew her contract which will be a big shame.
Have to get a petition up or something.
Yeah erm I dunno if it would do much good actually but er yeah but er no she, she's, she's quite good about you know sort of erm you know kind of keeping an eye on students and, and stuff like that, anyway er so if you could  right 
see you  see you again  
Er right see you soon then.
Bye.
Hello tape recorder, you seemed to go off there for a while, I'm just checking that you're still working again, thanks very much.
So that's why I'm going around with a little machine and a microphone on 
 
and they're trying to get some record of, of what 
It's best to explain it you know.
yeah sort of Eng er how English is spoken sort of around er in different, you know, circumstances in private places and universities and television and 
 
all sorts of things like that.
A lot of things and don't knows 
Yeah.
with me so
Mm.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay?
What it was it's from this book really 
Mhm.
which  was this study
Mm.
here which I've read about, it's got erm articles about the blind, dreams of the blind
Oh yeah?
now  what, what it actually was was  er some  a systematic set of questions about the natural experience of people prone to auditory and visual images, number of people in 
Yeah.
now I've looked it up, that's supposed to actually be in our library
Yeah.
but it's not now I've 
Mhm.
left a note for a while now  them 
Is, mm 
to try and locate it but
er what er 
It's the 
is it a book or a journal?
no it's a journal, it's the
Erm
erm  disease, mental disease or something  
well is it er there's a thing about general nervous and mental dis 
general nervous and mental disease, that's the one, yeah.
Yeah Oh right.
It's one of seventy which is supposedly the first one they've got 
Mm.
there but 
Oh right erm well often the coverage, even when they think they've got it, is not terribly good
Mm.
erm for some reason certain issues don't seem to have appeared in the first place
No.
or if they have people have nicked them and, and 
Right.
all sorts of other things.
Yeah.
It's er it's not that obscure er have you checked Birmingham University library or anything like that?
It might be worth a, a bit of bus riding around 
I haven't yet no, no cos, yeah I was 
and you might be able to get it erm 
me and Gareth wanna go over there and you know I'll  
Oh yes, yes.
and he wants to get it for his disability project to see if he can get  
Oh right so, mhm 
you know I think we're gonna take a trip over anyway so 
Yeah, yeah excellent, good, so you might be able to find some more stuff.
Right erm questionnaire, I've got in contact with the Institute again
Yeah?
erm with these people
Mhm.
erm she said she thought everything would be okay apart from partial blind due to accident after teenage years cos it's basically it's actually a college
Mhm.
which she said they do have people who don't progress much staying on 
Yeah.
but on the whole it's like 
Yeah.
you know sixteen to  mostly 
Yeah.
sixteen to twenty one year olds 
Mhm.
so erm
So er
see talk I'm talking about twenty five
okay so it, yeah it looks like quite a reasonable number of people possibly 
Yeah.
yeah?
Good.
Yeah.
Oh and she's just said you know get 'em a questionnaire done, that was really what was
Yeah yeah fine.
you know wanted to get with you really.
Yes erm
Erm  right  yeah this was just asking myself really and for you
Mhm.
erm  right in the book and other ones I've read, cos I've also got, well I've got quite a few journals with 
Yeah, yeah, good.
with the various ones so erm  some of them done like open ended, see what I was wondering was, where, I wrote this    organized here 
Yeah.
Yeah it was analyzing it erm  whether I wanted to do general questions on general dreams that A
Mm.
tell me how their dreams are formed
Yeah.
or  which is one which they've done in there, is take a specific dream which they've had which is vivid to them
Mhm.
and describe with all feelings and everything
Yeah
and trying to  
Mm.
as opposed to as prompting questions to ask 
Yeah.
about analysis or me giving them the dream and I have to sort of like get out for myself what 
Yeah.
how they do it.
Well I mean you could do a bit of both, I don't see why you can't sort of start out with some general stuff about whether 
That's what, that's what I was thinking, that's what I was thinking of doing, yeah.
they actually experience dreams at all 
Yeah.
you know because some people claim not to, blind and sighted, er you know and then, then maybe you can sort of say well, you know, what sort of things do you see, what sort of things do you feel and then get on to something specific 
Mm.
you know, can you think of one you might've had last night or one that you particularly remember or something like that
Yeah.
They've had some 
and try and 
incredible dreams
oh right so you actually er  mm.
it's really funny, yeah I, I went over there erm it was really to meet the woman but I ended up erm she said do you wanna spend the afternoon with them 
Yeah.
so they had like an hour break so I spent  in a room .
See the trouble, the trouble which I found was it was difficult trying, you know, it's not about dream con you know it's not about 
Mm.
dream meaning and 
Yeah.
they were sort of like you know interested in what I  you know  you see what I mean?
It was difficult 
Oh yeah, so yeah, absolutely yes there's that er whenever anything's to do with dreaming 
Yeah.
there's that suspicion that you're trying to 
Yeah.
er access what their personality's all about, you know they, mm 
There's, there's, there's one one bloke had a erm speaking, a dog which spoke to them which gave them the  
Oh yeah?
for the next day 
Mm.
races oh I mean you know 
Yeah .
they're, they're quite  
Yeah.
erm
Were the dog's tips any good or er did it turn out 
He said he could never remember them 
Oh right.
he says he can never remember the names, it's the times that er 
Mm.
Yeah er 
he's not a millionaire yet.
No so perhaps not, mm.
Oh perhaps, perhaps he, perhaps he has the knowledge but has difficulty in er navigating his way to the betting shop to to do anything about it.
 
Anyway erm
Right I've  results see this is
Mm.
this is really what I'm  
Yeah.
comparison of subjects within groups and between groups I thought that's 
Yeah, mm.
like a typical  analysis variance
Well yeah it cer it certainly 
But  
it certainly can be.
Erm it depends on erm it depends on what you ask them though  er if you get erm excuse me
if you get er  I'm just trying not to ripple the fabric just yet
erm sorry that's going on the tape recorder isn't it?
Never mind.
 
erm
if you  it depends on what you do I mean if you're generating quantitative material, you know, if you get some sort of scale ratings of things like sort of estimates of how, how frequently they dream 
That's exactly why I wanted that  because they've done 
estimates of erm yeah so they've actually got a, a standard questionnaire in this paper that you can't find yet?
Mm.
Mm.
Right good.
Erm you know all feelings of how vivid they are on average or feelings about how  you know any,anyth anything you can write a question about that, that you can put on a scale of some sort 
Yeah.
that you can try and get them to say well is that sort of moderately vivid or very vivid or very very vivid or  absolutely compelling just like real life or  erm I, I don't know what, what, what you'd be able to do erm it's obviously gotta be something that you can present orally
Yeah.
er but erm that kind of thing where you can sort of scale the responses in some way or say how many times a week or say how many times in the last year or how many times since Christmas or something erm fine yeah you can do, you can do stats on that, you can hopefully find P less than point O five etcetera etcetera between the different groups
Mm.
you can also erm  maybe try and correlate things like, oh I don't know, how frequently they came, claim to dream with how much they rate their enjoyment of dreams on average or, you know, all these kinds of things are possible
Mm.
erm equally if you can't get any significant differences between the five different groups of five people you can try and split the stuff up, once you've got the data you can try and split it up in other ways, divide them into two groups and see 
Yeah.
if  you know there are any other kinds of differences.
Mm.
with,wi is 
Yeah sorry yeah.
obviously with the questionnaire I'm going, I wanna get, like you said, a lot of results where I can split them up, you know 
Yeah.
it's really getting the questionnaire in a good format that's what 
Yeah, mm.
I'm worried about cos basically it leads on I know
Yeah.
you know talking to five, you know, people who've done their projects, they've said some of the trouble going out
Yeah.
you know was that they'd got results which they couldn't sort of like apply 
Mm.
so I'm trying to do it
Yeah.
you know, look at the results and to effectively try and to sort of like estimate them.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm yeah.
 
The poor old printer seems to have broken, it won't, it won't 
 
it won't make the paper lie down flat when er when it's finished.
Yeah that's just an updated list of, of project people because some people have changed their titles and, and some people have
There's some interesting titles isn't there?
Yeah.
I'm really, I was really impressed  
Mm.
So erm  yeah so I don't know in, in, in some ways what the questionnaire actually ends up looking like is, is, is up to you, I mean you've already spoken to some of these people and spoken to some of the organizations involved 
Yeah.
and, and stuff like that so I mean in a sense you're by now a fairly good judge of  the way to go about this sort of thing, you're a fairly good judge of what sort of things are important, perhaps the way in which people describe stuff and, and, you know, words, concepts, vocabularies erm all that kind of thing which obviously it helps if your questionnaire fits in with
Yeah.
erm  so  erm  I don't know it's just down to generating some questions.
Mm.
I mean you may want to er  for example, you know in some ways some of the responses may fit in quite nicely as a point on a scale or something like that, you may have some, you know, be able to  in fact I advise you to come up with a fair number of quantitative type questions 
Right.
where you, you get a scale response to them and we can do stats on but equally, if you get people to describe their most recent dream or describe their most erm, you know, compelling dream or, you know, a good one that they've had in the last year or something like that, you may want to try and get that on tape or something like that erm if possible, yeah.
Yeah I was wondering about using tape actually.
I'm afraid I, I've only got one spare tape recorder and I've lent it to somebody already  erm 
Yeah  yeah 
so mm 
I've got one 
erm so er it's sometimes possible to borrow from the university but they usually, they usually make it very difficult for one so er oh thanks, erm  so erm  anyway because with a thing like people's accounts of dreams you may want to sort of go back and look at them, you know, sort of how people have expressed them in their own words, they may have er you know produced some nice interesting quotes or something like that
Mm.
you know to er
Yeah.
er you know express the dream in or express their feelings about it.
Well it's very, it's really interesting actually I had 
Yeah mm.
a brilliant afternoon, it was
Yeah, good.
it was really exciting.
Yeah
Erm
so er 
other things to  right
Mm.
I've got, in the introduction
Mm.
er do you think it should be in the form of like a erm you know abstract introduction method er yeah 
Yeah I think that's usually the safest thing to go for with these things
Right.
however you've done the inve investigation, it looks like you've already spotted some literature of various kinds
Mhm.
articles, books and stuff like that which talk about this thing  erm it helps obviously if you can link in what you're asking people to some of these previous ideas, theories, bits of evidence 
 
and stuff like that
Mm.
so it looks like, when you write it up it looks like some, it's got some sort of continuous argument to it
Mm.
Yeah.
which often looks quite nice so that even if what you've found doesn't quite match up with what they've found you can say well look you know these theories, ideas are  need enriching, they're a bit inadequate as they stand because what happens when somebody tells you this, what happens when somebody says this erm you know we can, we can revise them in the following way  
Mm.
which is question section erm you know you can tell that kind of s equally 
Yeah.
you may find that certain pe 
Mm.
got so much dreams
Mm.
erm but you know when you 
Yeah.
go through it's quite, you know 
Yeah.
applicable a lot of
Cos I mean those mental rotation tasks are, you know, fairly standard er cognitive tests that 
Mm.
are sometimes used as part of I Q tests and things like that sometimes 
Right.
so er that's old is it  Shepherd and Metzler No it's not in this case but I think they invented the task, yes they did  good old  Shepherd and Metzler 
erm er so erm yeah er  you know sort of spatial ability type 
Mm.
things.
Erm tt yeah but er  so anyway whatever strands you can draw out of these things
Mm.
you know in terms of, not necessarily the precise content, but you can get erm some general idea about how people have studied the mental life of blind persons and how, you know, maybe it's interesting that er presumably most of the people who've studied it are themselves sighted rather than blind themselves you know 
That's right, yeah.
I mean it's like the, the able bodied studying the disabled, men studying women 
Mm.
whites studying blacks, you know, all those  other kinds of imbalances in, in psychology in the social sciences erm which might be interesting erm  cos like Guy sometimes says about erm  when he was er talking to some er deaf people, well perhaps not talking's the right word but communicating with some deaf people about their, about their problems, I mean this bloke said  you psychologists are all the same you just think that deaf people need cochlea implement 
Yeah  said that.
i implant and yeah that kind of thing and er whereas, you know, in this guy's view it would erm involve the erosion of, of the whole culture of sign language
Mm.
you know that, that you know he saw something valuable and wanted to preserve presumably so 
Yeah I think cos he said about that in the lecture about the 
Mm, yeah, mm 
sort of like friction it caused.
Mm yeah.
Yeah erm so er you know you may find some traces of a more, you know, kind of er I don't know, politicized understanding on the part of blind people as to, you know, what it means to you know kind of have their life investigated 
Well one of the well one of them was saying 
Mm.
like a lot of people ask 
Mm.
about the dreams of bli you know ask us and er 
Yeah.
Yeah.
said you know they ask us about colour and 
Mhm.
you know, said you know it's so  narrowminded of them to ask us that, you know, if you're 
Yeah.
completely blind you know the concept of colour they said 
Mm.
Mm.
they said colour was one of the hardest
Mm.
things to like, like a colour green you'd have to 
Yeah.
describe it as fresh, you know, and
But that, we only have that, that's only by association for, for, for sighted people, yeah 
That's right, exactly exactly so 
so  
you know they said mm that's right.
Mm.
Mm.
Now
Yeah.
another thing was in, in the introduction I wondered how much explanation of like general structured dreams
Mm are, are there people coming in?
Oh no it's, it's a, they've wandered off, oh never mind 
Mm  
it's just some students that gra well mature student who graduated last year so  anyway carry on.
  

Mm yeah.
Erm it was sort of really from this book it's nineteen ninety one erm which is 
Yeah.
Right, good.
Mm.
you know all looking into how dreams of erm able sighted people and how 
Mm.
much do you want on that if you see what I mean to describe about dreams that 
Yeah erm 
to, for comparison?
well it's one of these things where if you sort of have a 
Cos it's quite detailed.
have a read of things and then on the basis of what your informants tell you then you can sort of focus it a bit more on erm tt you know the stuff that er  erm you know the stuff that comes out in the literature that's particularly 
 
well suited or well fitted with the, with the stuff that, you know, you've, you've got erm  I mean that's probably the best way to do it and I also find actually trying to write things sh myself shows up the holes in arguments, shows up the bits that you need yet to fill in sort of thing
Mm.
erm so I mean what I did with my final year project was actually try to write something which was very sort of wide ranging and broad which sort of was like a first dr draft of an introduction and then once I got more data
Mm.
sorted you know I could, I could try and zero it in a bit more on, on, on what the data was about erm
What did you do it on?
It was about er the press and unemployment and it was about  the way the effects of unemployment were written about in  well broadsheet and popular newspapers, it also involved a bit of a study where I gave people some articles to show which had been typed up in a fairly anonymous format and, and got them to rate them in various ways and that was in, let me see, nineteen eighty three  long long time ago  
 
Oh yeah Christmases are flicking past like Sundays
it's terrible  er yeah it does, it goes faster.
Erm yeah so I mean that's generally the way to go so I th I think you know it's probably worth working away towards a, a more specific set of questions that you might want to ask and, and think of ways of administering them so you get some sort of, you know, numerical information in the end.
Equally  you know things that might prompt people to talk, to describe dreams, to tell stories and that
Mm.
erm so er
Erm the other thing 
that kind of thing.
cos they were quite interested cos they hadn't had like anyone actually properly doing research or anything erm 
Mm.
she said you know could she have a copy and I said 
Mm.
you know I'll do a copy in braille 
Yeah fine.
as well which they said 
Oh wow.
would be absolutely brilliant  and 
Excellent.
she said she would erm  cos it's erm well it would work out about forty pound to have it done, thirty five 
What, have it done in braille?
Mm.
Er but she said she 
Oh that's not as bad as I thought because I'd always heard that it was like really really expensive to produce er material in braille.
Apparently as long as I get it on a P C disk, five inch 
Mhm.
well she said actually, she said she's gonna try and erm
Mm.
tt put it through the books there as well so 
Yeah.
you know she's gonna take off about 
Mm.
fifteen pound there and I've chat 
Mm.
I chatted to the bloke as well who did the
Mm.
who was partially blind as well actually who did the erm 
Yeah.
Mm.
processing and he said you know that'd be fine to do so 
Yeah.
Well I suppose  you know once you've got a machine that  effectively like a big dot r dot matrix I would've you could er you could do it with with something like a, a desk top printer er 
Mm.
and you know maybe it's getting easier these days, mm.
Yeah.
I was, I was surprised I thought it'd be a lot more cos I just you know 
Mm.
enquired just to see if I could do it but er 
Yeah.
Because in in the early days when it was invented I mean people were actually embossing the dots on by hand individually erm  so er  anyway yeah so, yeah that, that would be excellent, yeah, mm.
But I just thought, you know, it'd be nice to give it  because they have been, I mean they've been really helpful and
Excellent yeah 
so 
good, cos that's always the
Yeah .
thing with dealing with outside organizations, you know, that sometimes they're
Yeah.
either a bit off putting or a bit slow or a bit, you know, all sorts 
Mm.
of other things so er so that's er seems like so far so good almost
erm  you know, fingers crossed erm 
Yeah exactly, yeah.
anyway at least you've made contact and it seems, seems like it's going okay
Yeah exactly, there wasn't sort of 
and that's the main erm 
any friction at all between us so  
mhm, yeah, good erm 
I think that's about the lot really.
Think what I'll do is try and try and get hold of the other report and then
Yeah.
Mm.
erm  if I can bring a sample questionnaire when I've done it to you I mean I'll see 
Yeah certainly, yes.
Mm.
you know when I get there so obviously 
Mm.
Yeah.
then I'll make an appointment and just  
Yeah great stuff.
If you, so if you come in come in next week some time and 
Yeah.
Yeah.
also, it goes without saying, I mean the people at the other end would probably like to see a copy before you start just for, to see if they can suggest 
Mm.
anything, just for approval, you know, cos people, people, people, people, people like to think 
Yeah I mean that's what, that's what they would er 
they've been asked and, and stuff like that.
yeah.
I phoned up this week just to say I'm getting on with it and they sort of like she said she'd 
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.
try and get there's sorted out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good so er 
Righty-ho.
Right oh well glad to see er things are happening and, you know
things are progressing.
So much
Mm.
it's ridiculous this term  
Yeah.
Yeah mm  right good 
We've got four hundred  four hundred words a day we calculated we've gotta do  
Oh right er 
Dunno if that's a good way of looking at it.
Yeah well I dunno I'm dreading the Easter holidays cos I've got like erm we're probably gonna have about two hundred pieces of coursework to mark over Easter then there's, and they're sort of you know projecty things and things like that erm and then there's  first week next term there's like all these second year social, which is well over a hundred of them plus about forty final year projects will come in, plus about  I'm hoping it'll only be twenty things from Loughborough but  it might be as many as, as fifty if the other person gives me all their marking er as they have, they've given some indication that they will
oh it's alright I'll give you a couple of hundred quid for it but, you know, it's all, it's all 
Mm.
so erm yeah just hope I don't get ill between now and  round about July I think it'll all be over
That'd be the  wouldn't it?
so, yeah, yeah I mean if you have flu for a week or something, you know everything 
Yeah, exactly.
everything er
Once you get a week out of hand you know it just goes 
mm yeah, yeah when it's all sort of tightly packed together
Mm.
when it's all like an interference fit and, and there's not much room.
Oh I looked up about the last, the last essay I did cos it was about erm 
Mm.
smoking and trying to change erm strategies towards it, I don't know if you remember?
Erm it was 
It was about 
I remember doing someone smoking I can't remember yours specifically erm unfortunately so 
Oh it was just erm cos it said about, cos I couldn't work it out cos he said about a reference which was
Mm.
eighty one reference and the magazine wasn't out till
Well hang ab you'd er you'd put er you'd put the date some time in ninety four 
Yeah.
somewhere er which  or, or if, if it was the one
It was eighty three it was  
if it oh right so it was er 
but I looked and it was actually 
oh if it, if it was if it w if it was that one I think, I think there was some dis if, if it's the thing I'm thinking of there was some discrepancy, I think it was alright in the  s on one occasion there was some stuff which I couldn't find at the end
Yeah.
but there was some stuff with like dates that hadn't happened yet in ninety four or something er 
It was it was two magazines but what it actually was which I 
Yeah.
Mm.
If, I think if that's the one I was thinking was mm 
it's actually an Am it was  it was an American book which  cos it was Just Seventeen
Yeah.
and Good Housekeeping magazine which didn't  
Oh!
Oh, oh right erm oh we're talking about the  the actual titles of the things that didn't start till oh the sort of U K version 
Yeah that's right that was the problem 
didn't start till later.
I didn't know that's it's Amer it was the American one, that's what I  
Oh it was the American version?
Ah I beg oh I beg your pardon in that case erm
No that, yeah, that's, I couldn't work it out because 
because I, I remem I remember when the if it was the Seventeen er I remember when that was launched in the, in the U K and it was 
Mm.
some time after
I didn't have any idea 
the original 
cos I saw that and thought 
Mm.
you know it applied to the British 
Yeah.
cos I didn't  just 
Erm 
but it was the American, they're American magazines  
mm.
Oh right, yeah.
so
Oh I beg your pardon then.
No no  .
No it's  no it's alright  it just, it just puzzled me because I couldn't see where it had, might have come from 
Well I thought 
Yeah.
Righty-ho then
Mm.
I'll get on  
Yeah good.
Okay.
So was, was it also you that had got some, some, some dates in the references that hadn't happened yet like the  erm  pe there was somebody it might have been you had actually referred to things that, you know, sort of twenty first of the fourth ninety four and things like that and it was sort of 
Don't think so.
Oh it was probably not you, that was probably somebody else then but I remember seeing that, you know 
Yeah I don't remember, no I think that was 
no that was er that was another example of peculiar dates in, in, in references and er stuff like 
They can obviously see in the future  
Yes I was thinking that you know perhaps they could er 
quite, quite talented really, a waste of  
you know sort of erm read the, the racing columns or the er  or the, or the, or the, or the  
I think that's   
or the stock market reports or something like that.
  

Yeah mm.
Right, cheers then.
Okay right.
I'll just see if that er that  character who was looking in the window's still around.
Mm.
Oh right
yeah so er ah
Cheers 
okay, cheers.
Oh hello, I just wanna say hello to Pete
Right
and, and, well and to you as well Viv but er I haven't seen Viv, I haven't seen Pete for a while.
I'll get some of this later 
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
I, I  I went to as we came down, suddenly realized you'd got somebody there you were obviously deep in conference so er 
Yeah.
but I, I'll give you a knock when I've finished if I can  
Yeah fine yes please do, I might, there might be somebody else in there with me by then er
Well I, I won't disturb you.
it's quite, quite, quite, quite rare I have a spare moment these days but er yeah please do er give us a knock when you've finished here.
Right cheers.
Bye.
Oh what er
but it's in the mail  
Yeah.
arrive this afternoon, I've sent it back 
Oh excellent because I 
to the er
Mm.
to the writer to the author of the chap 
Yeah.
of the erm  
Yeah.
Okay well it will be interesting to see what er what other people have, have said about it because I was sort of fishing around a bit in the dark and looking at the stats manual 
One review was absolutely crap
Mhm.
just about three lines
Oh.
the other review is really good, just as good as yours and he and you are saying very much the same things.
Well I never.
Oh, right.
So the, the S P S S manual didn't let me down then.
I did take out one thing about the bible since it was going to somebody in the States in the bible belt and I didn't 
Ah you never know.
I didn't like to take any risks  
You never know yes, okay well that's er
I did wipe out your comment about the bible
Oh well that's fine.
but apart from that it went in
Mm.
exactly as you'd put it.
Right okay so they can, they can, I ca they can er curse me and send me death threats now if they so desire.
Well they don't know, it's anonymous
Oh right yeah.
I took your signature off the bottom.
Okay well, well I don't mind them knowing who I am, I er I mean it's a, you know, if they do want to, mm 
anonymous 
Yeah.
Anyway I must get on.
See you later.
So, okay right.
Cheers.
Right.
I don't want to encourage     Erm     mention this morning or is that gonna be embarrassing
No.
or sh Right okay, button's plugged in, microphone on and off we go.
Okay.
No problem.
Oh dear    Ha  parcels, I love parcels.
I tell you what, would you like to open the parcels?
Yeah 
Right that'll give you something to do.
Erm  erm not exactly no.
Right.
Erm  phew!
Ah!
Well what can we do for you?
Did you  
Yes I did.
Yes erm let's just er find it again, no that's not it, I must have it here somewhere.
No it hasn't been there for a little while  British National Corpus  I've been carrying it around with me
and I wonder what I've done with it.
Therapies and, no erm    erm  as I recollect er ah!
Here it is.
I was gonna say as I recollect I didn't see much wrong with it that I would disagree with erm I think it's nice to see, you know, sort of progress seems to be going on and erm er  what I would say is sort of it might be a good idea to sort of line the numbers up a bit more but erm 
Yeah.
Yeah.
er
I did actually 
aside fr 
I looked at it mys I changed a bit 
Mm.
myself, I could feel that the order
Yeah.
of the questions weren't
Mhm.
cos like
So is this like er s er yet another version from this or is that like an older one er 
Oh well it's the same questions I've just changed the 
Mm.
order of the questions 
Yeah.
Aha.
cos I thought maybe asking about their own experience but okay 
Mhm.
before like putting all these categories cos it 
Yeah.
Yeah.
might put ideas 
Yeah.
in their head or something.
Yeah erm that might be  true but then sometimes it can be an adventure to put ideas in people's heads so they actually write something
Oh right.
erm  because I have had the trouble of 
 
asking open ended questions and like nobody says anything so er 
Oh.
erm however I always find with questionnaires it's very difficult to predict what's going to go wrong in advance so 
Mm.
erm you might as well do a bit of a erm you know kind of give it a go and see what happens 
Mm.
erm now erm  I think er  I think yeah that was okay.
It might be, if there's a little bit of room, it might be worth sort of s moving the numbers slightly towards the  erm  items so that, because if you sort of 
Yeah.
look across it's  you know can be a bit 
That was what I
yeah
thought about that.
I thought about putting 
Mm.
but then I thought it might take up too much space.
Well I wouldn't worry too much about cramming it all together tightly because it's erm one of the few things we've still got a budget for is photocopying student questionnaires so you m you know, you might as well take advantage of that, it doesn't erm it doesn't cost you anything and the actual difference it makes to the university and to erm world resources is very slight indeed I think
Okay 
so er  you know
okay.
er so you might want to, you know, kind of space it out slightly erm 
Yeah.
er  right erm  tt yep  that seems to be  okay I didn't erm  no  I was reading this on, this morning just after the clinical lecture and I didn't see anything that, that I thought would be problematic erm  you know given, you know, sort of what I've seen in your coursework so far you seem to have got a fairly good idea of what you can ask and what you can get away with and what sorts of things you think are useful and, and, and stuff like that so erm  you know I'm entirely happy with your judgment as to the content erm you know because it's part of an ongoing pr project and it's not just something that you've, you've  knocked off in half an hour or anything so erm 
 
you know I, I think, I think  usually what I say about questionnaires is towards the business of, you know, kind of writing them in people's own words that, that sort of fit in with ordinary language okay  putting them in a sensible order  advising people to do scale type things with five or seven points or something which you've got a lot of already so a lot of the comments that I normally make on people's questionnaires er you can take as read as it were erm so I think erm  you know just really one or two minor things about layout like, you know, you know sort of space and, and moving things around a wee bit, it might make them easier to read but again as I say that's a  you know relatively minor erm problem.
So in the other version that you've got what sort of changes to the order have you made?
Erm 
Well I put   I put all these questions about erm have you witnessed violence or not I put 
Yeah.
I put them first and then I 
Mhm.
put  erm  all this about what you think force is 
You put all the scaly things 
After
there
yeah
erm  yeah erm  well I wonder  erm  again it's difficult to tell what's going to work best.
In some ways as regards the, the layout and the appearance of the thing I tend to prefer this version because on this one erm if we have a look at that there's just like l oh my God loads of numbers oh no 
Yeah.
I can't be bothered to answer that, throw it away  erm 
you know erm not that they will but er you know it it's, it's one of these things that, that sort of looks like there's a bit of variety on it when you've got  mm 
Mm.
you know alternating things you know 
Yeah.
with some, some things to write a few words in, some things to tick, some things to make a mark on  one of the numbers and so forth so erm er  you know it's erm  but as I say it's difficult to er 
Well maybe if I got a couple of people to fill in
Mm.
the different versions and see
Yeah fine see, see which they er which they, do a bit of market research as it were, yes 
Mm.
erm that can sometimes help certainly, yeah, but er as I say er I think there should be  it should yield a, a  fair amount of data for you and, and you know with a bit of, are you a stat view or S P S S person or any strong 
Oh 
preferences or?
I think you have to use S P S S cos I didn't 
Right fair enough.
well I did do stat view in the first year but not very much  
Yeah.
No, no I 
how to use it.
find stat view very difficult to use myself but er when the time comes, once you've got a few that are filled in we can erm  well I'll show you how to do an S P S S data file and, and erm so you can bash your data in and if you bring it back we can turn it into a system file and analyze it.
Erm so er  that shouldn't be too bad.
So I don't know do you, do you fancy now kind of giving the different versions to a few people by way of er er
Yeah.
another pilot and, and see if erm
Well I'll just do it in my flat I suppose  
Yeah.
Yeah fair enough if, if that's erm you know how you fancy starting.
And then if you  
finish it off.
any, any sort of, yeah, any sort of changes or anything erm  er  I don't know if you're around sort of early next week we can
Yeah.
get the
Yeah.
things reprographicated and
Yeah.
and er
it usually takes about three working days and er
Okay.
and away you go.
How  subjects are you ?
Erm  with a thing like this, I mean what I usually say to people it depends on erm if you've got a lot of numerical data, oh you might as well have this back for the time being so 
 
sweaty hands soaking into it or anything
erm er then it does help, if you're looking for P less than point O five, and aren't we all these days, erm 
 
you know  er it helps if erm it helps if the groups that you're comparing between there's about sort of at least twenty people in each sort of thing, erm  and the same goes for things like, things that you might want to do  squares on or something like that erm so I mean if you were interested in comparing people who attended very regularly with people who only attended once in a while erm you know it would help if there were about sort of  more than forty people altogether so that there was sort of, you know 
Mm.
you could median split them at  whatever the medium was and then you've got two groups to compare erm because it usually looks quite nice if you've got something comparative as well as looking at the average sort of, you know, pattern of responses on the questionnaire.
Equally if you've got erm  I don't know what other kinds of differences you might want to erm  er  look for but again if you're looking for differences it helps if there's about sort of twenty people in each of the groups sort of thing.
Or if you're comparing people with themselves as it were, that is looking for differences between how they answer one question and how they answer another question, then sort of , you know, kind of twenty or more people and you've got a reasonable chance of showing up some, some P less than point O fives.
Erm  I don't know that's, this is not in any official stats books but it's just my experience with students' projects that if you get more than, there's a sort of critical mass of about, about forty respondents and then you're much more likely to start showing some interesting statistically significant findings for some reason, erm I don't quite know why but er   it's one of life's little mysteries but er so that's  usually if there's a lot of numerical data what I'd try and advise people to er to get.
Oh that's 
So you know I mean more than that by all means, you know, er so much the better, you know y the more the merrier but erm certainly you know kind of it's a good idea to at least try and get that many erm
Yeah.
so er
I've got, I've got in touch with a football supporters society
Mm.
and erm they've got eighty members so 
Oh right.
Mhm.
so they're like sending me a list, well they sent me back a  half list 
Mm.
I said to them can I have a list they said oh yeah sure she went we'll put it in your 
Mm.
Mm.
pigeon hole, you know it's just like bit of, scrap of paper with like a few names on it
Mm.
and they said oh we'll get the list to you, the full list to you as soon as possible I mean 
Yeah.
that was about two weeks ago  
Yeah.
Well I mean it's often things that people do in their spare time the, the record keeping isn't perfect and, and 
Yeah that's the thing they haven't got time, yeah.
they don't have a, you know, kind of computer based mailing list that they can print out or something you know?
No  yeah I know that so 
Mm.
so I should
Yeah.
if I, if I get in touch with them then I'll  
Mm.
Yeah I mean that might certainly give you some, you know, kind of you know regular attenders to er to, to
Yeah.
to look at erm so er  yeah
Great.
Are you into football very much yourself or er
Yeah.
Oh right mm so it's, it, this, this emerges out of a personal interest thing?
Yeah  
Oh right.
Mm.
Yeah I support Bristol City
Oh right.
Are you from that part of the world at all or?
Er Forest of Dean.
Oh right so er mm
Yeah it's the nearest place really.
Yeah within the nearest place with  a biggish
With a  yeah.
football team possibly yeah.
Anyway
Right.
Right so er 
I think that's everything.
Yeah.
So if I get it laid out again then, you know
Yeah fine erm but as I say it's just sort of you know kind of minor layout changes, that's all I was suggesting
Yeah.
so you know at a pinch you could probably run it like that and I don't suppose anybody would notice the difference but, you know, just in terms of you know making things look attractive
Right.
erm  so  you know but you may find if you give, print off a few and give them to a few people over the weekend
Mm.
you may find that some additional changes occur to you
Mm.
which you might want to incorporate anyway so you may not want to print off another version anyway
Yeah.
so er
Erm oh yeah the other thing was  it's two sided at the moment, is that
Mm.
best or do you think 
Erm generally speaking the consensus is it helps if it's sort of on one side
Oh right.
but how you do your original is up to you I mean it's just what we ask for from reprographics and you know they do single sided 
Okay yeah.
double sided, collated, stapled
different coloured paper and all, you know, all this sort of thing
Yeah.
so er erm  er  so that's  no, is there anything else we need to worry about  with regard to that?
Er no I don't think so.
So as I say I think it'll, I think it'll, it'll run okay and behave itself on the assumption you can get some people to fill it in so er
Yeah.
yeah right.
Right, good.
Okay.
Well do have er a pleasant weekend
Okay.
Mm.
I shall try to.
Yeah.
And yourself  
Oh yes I could do with one.
Are you working?
Yeah well I'm, I'm gonna try and get the final year lecture for Tuesday sorted actually on Saturday and erm it's usually, it's usually Guy but I think I'm doing it this week, yeah, because I've got quite a few to do on things like racist  in the media and Guy's mate Dennis  has just written a book and he's given me a manuscript of it and it's about how racist psychology is which is
Really?
yeah and he's spotted racism in the Atkinson et al textbook and all sorts of, all over the place so erm mm there should be something interesting to talk about in that for a start.
Yeah.
So er anyway
Okay.
more of this on Tuesday.
See you 
Mm.
Bye then.
Mm.
Oh hello.
So what have we got, have they sent me some new textbooks?
Oh lovely.
But one's for you and one's for Guy
Oh I see, oh blimey.
Ah.
Have you finished in there now?
Erm yes I've finished with the students 
 
oh right, oh I didn't realize, there were just two parcels on the erm
Yeah look
on the thing and, and I picked them both up 
you see.
I thought they were both for me.
Oh dear.
Ah!
Oh well erm 
Yeah I didn't fancy 
let's see 
going up to the senile  
No I don't I don't blame you.
Erm
I sort of started to feel a bit ill before so   
Yeah.
Well do er do come in er  well did you have a pleasant trip down?
Erm yeah it was okay, it wasn't too bad.
Mm.
Alright  cos I think we've been sent these on approval to see if we want to adopt them for course material 
Yeah.
you see so erm
They seem quite nice.
Yeah.
Erm well I, I don't know quite what erm they'll be teaching you out of in your er abnormal course but erm er I do find the, the  the sort of current generation of American textbooks quite erm
Mm.
quite a nice, quite exciting erm I tell you what, swivel that swivel chair round and, and sit on that
Okay.
Do you have a drink please or  
Yes of course.
Now erm what sort of flavours appeal?
Now we've got ordinary tea, we've got herbal tea, we've got coffee out of a coffee machine, we've got Lapsang Souchong, we've got ordinary tea  I've mentioned that already haven't I?
Erm
We've got soap powder and shampoo
Oh I'll have some sort of tea, that'll do.
Yeah.
Well we've got, what about some, some Lapsang?
It's sort of Lapsang teabags, that's quite 
Yeah.
quite refreshing, I've had a lot of coffee already today.
I'll just go and fill the kettle.
Okay.
Are you going to eat this cheese roll?
Well would you like some?

What's in the middle?
elderly it's cheese and pickle
Oh good, I can't  
Oh well  yeah, got you there.
Erm  yeah   if er you have no objection, what it's for is the, there's this outfit called the British National Corpus and they're trying to make a record of English Language as it's used in the late twentieth century erm  so it's a sort of resource for further scholarship so it can assist in writing dictionaries and studying grammar and, and all sorts of things like that and erm they're attempting to tape conversations from all over the place erm  er I've got a bit of bumph about it, it's quite interesting erm  and in some cases it's sort of out of erm  er  it's out of people's homes, it's out of broadcasts, it's out of meetings, it's out of all sorts of things erm at work and at home erm 
Have you just turned it on now?
Yeah it's, it's just on at the moment er they didn't hear any the other stuff
Oh.

oh yes it's Oxf er Oxford University Press, Chambers Dictionaries, British Library, Lancaster University  Oxford University erm  so er  it's erm  quite interesting so 
Do you mind if I have a cigarette?
No go ahead
Are you sure?
go ahead I don't, no I don't mind people smoking in here, it's fine by me.
