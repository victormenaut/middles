A Martian Sends a Postcard Home
Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings
and some are treasured for their markings —
they cause the eyes to melt
or the body to shriek without pain.
I have never seen one fly, but
sometimes they perch on the hand.
Mist is when the sky is tired of flight
and rests its soft machine on ground:
then the world is dim and bookish
like engravings under tissue paper.
Rain is when the earth is television.
It has the property of making colours darker.
Model T is a room with the lock inside —
a key is turned to free the world
for movement, so quick there is a film
to watch for anything missed.
But time is tied to the wrist
or kept in a box, ticking with impatience.
In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps,
that snores when you pick it up.
If the ghost cries, they carry it
to their lips and soothe it to sleep 
with sounds.
And yet, they wake it up
deliberately, by tickling with a finger.
Only the young are allowed to suffer
openly.
Adults go to a punishment room
with water but nothing to eat.
They lock the door and suffer the noises
alone.
No one is exempt
and everyone's pain has a different smell.
At night, when all the colours die,
they hide in pairs
and read about themselves —
in colour, with their eyelids shut.
Listen with Mother
We pecked at the shallow tide-rnarked marble
and sketched a cross like Italians arguing…
Sixpence safe in my glove, a clean handkerchief,
and the Sacred Heart spilsy as a cactus
on the front of my Missal, I tiptoed
and genuflected like a little Quasimodo,
crippled by embarrassment — late again…
The snore of Latin, the radiator's vertebrae,
an altar boy's baseball boots under his cassock —
it all comes back, vivid and meaningless.
I never liked God, but struggled with him
like algebra and trigonometry, relieved
to get outside under a pointilliste sky,
and let the snowflakes' sacrament
melt on my outstretched tongue.
But my mother clasped her naked hands
like Adam and Eve puffy with weeping,
and her rosary draped its tactful vine.
Pretty Baa Lamb
On tiptoe over to my baby daughter,
the umbilicus a black twig,
thin as a strand of spaghetti,
caught in the fleece.
It balances on thick joints
like an old woman's fingers —
bones in a liberty bodice
the colour of ash,
a tight garment
boucle with crisp cinders.
I give it a finger to suck
and it pulls like a plughole
with the fierce strength
of a week, while I notice
orange rubber bands around
the scrotum and the tail —
they will wither, unnoticed
as the brittle umbilicus.
Its life a death
exact in every detail,
the lamb belongs here
in the improbable dream
we tell to each other,
day after day, before it fades.
Sexual Couplets
Here we are, without our clothes,
one excited watering can, one peculiar rose…
My shoe-tree wants to come,
and stretch your body where it lies undone…
I am wearing a shiny souwester;
you are coxcombed like a jester…
Oh my strangely gutted one,
the fish head needs your flesh around its bone…
We move in anapaestic time and pause,
until my body rhymes with yours…
In the valley of your arse,
all flesh is flesh, all flesh is grass…
One damp acorn on the tweedy sod —
then the broad bean dangles in its pod.
Floods
Bright as meringues, the swans sweep
sideways down the passionate water.
The boathouse punts are magnetized,
and the rain scores a bull's-eye every time.
There is a bank of froth against the bridge.
It has thrown in the sponge…
The flood shines like Occam's razor.
Every quibble returns to the torrent,
and even the slow digressions at our feet
are part of an overall argument.
They cover all the points of grass.
What single-minded brilliance,
what logic!
Not one of us can look away.
In the Kalahari Desert
The sun rose like a tarnished
looking-glass to catch the sun
and flash His hot message
at the missionaries below —
Isabella and the Rev. Roger Price,
and the Helmores with a broken axle
left, two days behind, at Fever Ponds.
The wilderness was full of home:
a glinting beetle on its back
struggled like an orchestra
with Beethoven.
The Halle,
Isabella thought and hummed.
Makololo, their Zulu guide,
puzzled out the Bible, replacing
words he didn't know with Manchester.
Spikenard, alabaster, Leviticus,
were Manchester and Manchester.
His head reminded Mrs Price
of her old pomander stuck with cloves,
forgotten in some pungent tallboy.
The dogs drank under the wagon
with a far away clip-clopping sound,
and Roger spat into the fire,
leaned back and watched his phlegm
like a Welsh rarebit
bubbling on the brands…
When Baby died, they sewed her
in a scrap of carpet and prayed,
with milk still darkening
Isabella's grubby button-through.
Makololo was sick next day
and still the Helmores didn't come.
The outspanned oxen moved away
at night in search of water,
were caught and goaded on
to Matabele water-hole —
nothing but a dark stain on the sand.
Makololo drank vinegar and died.
Back they turned for Fever Ponds
and found the Helmores on the way…
Until they got within a hundred yards,
the vultures bobbed and trampolined
around the bodies, then swirled
a mile above their heads 
like scalded tea leaves.
The Prices buried everything —
all the tattered clothes and flesh,
Mrs Helmore's bright chains of hair,
were wrapped in bits of calico
then given to the sliding sand.
‘In the bcginning was the Word’—
Roger read from Helmore's Bible
found open at St John.
Isabella moved her lips,
‘rhe Word was Manchester’.
Shhh, shhh, the shovel said.
Shhh…
The Old Botanical Gardens
(for Chris and Lucinda)
This delicate sapling
still wears a caliper,
and will never get well
or lose its impetigo now,
for the healers have gone
whose hands could cure
the tap with bronchitis
and make the weather fine.
Eglon, the King of Moab,
is dead in his hothouse,
a leaking bag of peat,
his fez on the floor:
the city of palm trees
he possessed has gone,
his summer parlour cold
as a broken iceberg…
The botanical gardens
are empty of everything
but grievances, like
an atheist's heaven.
Grave on bare grave
and a host of placards,
demanding the return
of flowers from exile:
strangers with Latin names
that are shy on the tongue.
They force us to falter,
like a lump in the throat,
though the gardens are gone
and all our futile grief
a scourge of dead ivy
on a cold stone wall.
In the Mortuary
Like soft cheeses they bulge
sideways on the marble slabs,
helpless, waiting to be washed.
Cotton wool clings in wisps
to the orderly's tongs,
its creaking purpose done…
He calls the woman ‘Missus’,
an abacus of perspiration
on his brow, despite the cold.
And she is the usual woman —
two terra cotta nipples
like patches from a cycle kit,
puzzled knees, finely
crumpled skin around the eyes,
and her stomach like a watermark
held up to the light.
Distinguishing marks: none.
Colour of eyes: closed.
Somewhere, inside an envelope
inside a drawer, her spectacles…
Somewhere else, not here, someone
knows her hair is parted wrongly
and cares about these cobwebs
in the corners of her body.
A Journey to Greece
(for Stary and Kooee)
I Monocular
The mainland bares its negro chest —
those peppercorns of hair
are all the vegetation.
A dirty white wether, dragging
his fleece from Venice,
the ship is reddled
with a daub of rust
where the anchor curls
like a horn.
From the land,
the passengers are large as ticks…
I fit a pencil to the sharpener
and turn it in the socket.
Wood frills like a red carnation.
I close one eye against
the light, and make a note.
II Sirens and Hooters
After the silent Corinth Canal,
the boat goes mad — blowing
its nose, cleaning its teeth,
and trembling…
I take my baby daughter's hand
and toddle aft to watch the froth.
Bouzouki music woos us briefly
from a radio on the land.
III Sleepies
In Athens we see the ruins —
columns of corduroy, weatherworn
lions vague as Thurber dogs.
The baby sleeps, slumped
like a bean bag in her chair.
She's caught the sun.
More ferocious, leonine yawns,
more pillars sleeping it off
or standing tipsily…
IV Between Two Schools
Dolphins darn the sea.
Islands fade
to watermarks.
Spetsai…
I think about the mood of Greece,
how passionate she is,
and fierce.
I wave away a bee.
I pout at the pouting mackerel
and circumnavigate the dogs.
Across the street, the Telegraph's on sale.
I watch Golightly buy the late edition:
he fenestrates his starboard eye
and shakes out sail for England.
Stocks and shares
enter the porthole.
V Moly
A giant tortoise struggles
in and out of his awkward clothes.
Seurat shimmers in this ant hill.
I drop a pebble down the well
of H XAPA, the House of Joy —
XAPA, XAPA, the echoes ought to say
then stop.
No one lives here now,
except the animals.
The name
grows rusty on the gate.
My pebble makes a little grunt.
Lizards in the undergrowth
flush distant lavatories,
pears pursue their pregnancies,
the pine trees wring out beads of resin.
It's no use trying to be sad
about the dead
with so much life.
Ants cram withered petal poppadums…
VI Penelope
At night we burn our resinated logs.
Mosquitoes drift with paraplegic legs.
In bed we listen to the cinders
shift their weight and softly kiss,
burning with their happiness…
Our hosts go back along the jetty,
with their sticks to keep them steady.
They need each other for support.
By taking pain and taking cares,
they've made their love —
the bright meniscus sways unspilt…
I watch them like a glass
of something precious
at a tilt.
Karma
Rubbish smokes at the end of the garden,
cracking its knuckles to pass the time.
Appearances give up their ghosts today —
on the lawn, three blackbirds
play at grandmother's footsteps,
and a naughty wind has blown
the dress of each tulip
over its head.
The figs fill out
to maharani harem pants,
and the old pear tree,
pruned like a leper,
maladroitly drops its fruit.
For a moment, the eye is God —
setting a silver snail
to ring and rust for years
on a pair of ancient handlebars
(the saddle once growled as a dog).
The eye rewards and punishes —
poetic justice, calling up
a careless wind
to twitch undone
the careful turbans on the rosebush…
Shallots
Seven striped shallots are giving
a silent recital on their sitars
and the magnolia dances motionless,
like a deity with many arms.
Bells
bloom on her upturned finger tips.
We inhale the grass
and listen with our eyes
to the long, slow raga of summer
bending the air with vibrato…
Stoned flowers stare at the sun,
the baby contemplates her navel,
wise beyond words,
the guru of a perfumed garden.
I watch a tabla in your neck
perform its intricate rhythm,
and know that images provide
a kind of sustenance,
alms for every beggared sense —
each an avatar of generosity,
the dustbins bulge like vol-au-vents.
Dandelions
‘and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence’
— George Eliot: Middlemarch
Dead dandelions, bald as drumsticks,
swaying by the roadside
like Hare Krishna pilgrims
bowing to the Juggernaut.
They have given up everything.
Gold gone and their silver gone,
humbled with dust, hollow,
their milky bodies tan
to the colour of annas.
The wind changes their identity:
slender Giacomettis, Dore's convicts,
Rodin's burghers of Calais
with five bowed heads
and the weight of serrated keys…
They wither into mystery, waiting
to find out who they are,
patiently, before nirvana
when the rain comes down like vitriol.
Oberfeldwebel Beckstadt
The steelworks at Bremen
founder on the horizon
like an injured battleship.
It is the end of the war
and Oberfeldwebel Beckstadt
hasn't had time to shave.
A thousand feet above,
the camp is a crown of thorns
and above that, out of sight,
the castle's ruined endgame.
It is the end of the war
and Oberfeldwebel Beckstadt
unscrews his silencer.
Unteroffizieren slop petrol
from two jerry cans over the bodies
and climb into the truck.
He will say he cannot remember
how the Jews were like sheep
peeled by their shearers
and trembling in their pith,
how the grave looked innocent
as an emptied pond, how 
he forgot to light the match,
how it almost seemed real…
It is the end of the war
and back at the camp
Ianugo graces the lupin pods.
Four Jews are playing bowls,
gravely they herd together
the giant droppings.
It is time to go home
to a wife in curlers
like a barrister,
who will ask him questions,
call him Otto
and make him cry.
Down on the Funny Farm
The bell-bottomed carthorse stands
catatonic in its field —
lost raison d'etre of the limp astrolabe
that hangs in the outhouse
to demonstrate an equine universe.
You can see it cock an ear
and answer the grass in confidence.
Its ancestors haunt
the mixing bowl, stirred to a gallop
by the wooden spoon
and libations of flour and milk.
Everything is a little mad:
the twitchy rod has lost its thread
and gone to pieces,
so we keep it in a canvas jacket
with the tapes firmly tied.
Cows certify with shit,
sealing the land like a dotty diploma
and the distempered buildings
are powdered Turkish Delight…
But is it still a comedy of humours
to be suddenly touched 
by the sight of a new-laid egg?
To want to wipe away
from this one smudged face
the mucus and the excrement,
so many final straws
and the dirt of all dried tears?
Cold beyond comfort, it rocks
in a kitchen bowl.
And what about the kitchen bowl?
Poor dogsbody,
its hard enamel
is chipped like a dalmatian…
Laying a Lawn
(for Ian McEwan)
I carry these crumbling tomes
two at a time from the stack
and lay them open on the ground.
Bound with earth to last,
they're like the wordless books
my daughter lugs about unread
or tramples underfoot.
I stamp
the simple text of grass
with woodwormed brogues
while my daughter looks on,
holding her hard, muscular doll
by its only leg…
She hands me a caterpillar
rucked like a curtain, just as
one day she'll bring me teeth —
segments of sweet-corn
in the palm of her hand.
While she faces me, I needn't see
the thin charcoal crucifix
her legs and buttocks make,
only the hair on her body
like tiny scratches in gold,
her little cunt's neat button-hole,
and the navel's wrinkled pip…
For the moment, our bodies
are immortal in their ignorance —
neither one of us can read
this Domesday Book.
Mother Dressmaking
The budgerigar pecks at the millet,
his beak prised apart like a pistachio nut
by the fat kernel of tongue.
I draw,
wet profiles on the window pane.
We are immersed in making things.
The clock clicks its tongue…
trial and error.
She tries her shapes
in different ways like a collage,
until they are close without touching…
Pinned in place, they are packed
like a suitcase.
She takes
a prehistoric triangle of chalk
and leaves a margin for the seams.
Her scissors move through the material
like a swimmer doing crawl,
among the archipelago of tissue paper.
We are immersed, with our tongues out.
Waiting for the time when profiles run.
In the Dark
They were both in the dark.
She lied about her age,
the young Coldstream guard
about his inexperience.
While he took her to pieces
slowly, she watched a spider's web
as it shone in the sun
like a long-playing record.
Laid out on the grass,
her shrivelled tights, the wings
of her nylon bra.
Virgins.
She thought about, yes,
the Okey-Cokey
and wanted to laugh…
Six months later, the weather
turned conveniently cold —
a coat was possible indoors.
All the mirrors grew convex,
she fingered the globe
in its pregnant question mark.
Her father's miniatures
were little models of perfection —
the Vatican, St Paul's,
Westminster Abbey and Cathedral,
all made from Safety Matches.
He chopped their busbies off
with a tiny grunt,
as if he knew…
The brown Aspirin bottle
held a genie of cotton wool
and five hundred bitter wishes.
Counting carefully,
she vomited at the forty-first.
A week.
Another week.
She felt the pain of liver
writhing on the pan,
turned off the gas and crawled,
past an infinity of stair-rods.
God danced on his cross
at the foot of her bed
like Nijinsky having a heart attack…
Brought by the police, her father
listened in his dressing-gown.
She wouldn't come out of the river 
or give up the shoe-box
under her arm.
Headlights,
headlights and questions.
A fifteen year old face,
shiny as a peeled lychee, saying,
‘I didn't do anything, Dad’.
The grey pylons backed her up,
pulling out their empty pockets —
protesting innocence.
Flying to Belfast, 1977
It was possible to laugh
as the engines whistled to the boil,
and wonder what the clouds looked like —
shovelled snow, Apple Charlotte,
Tufty Tails…
I enjoyed
the Irish Sea, the ships were faults
in a dark expanse of linen.
And then Belfast below, a radio
with its back ripped off,
among the agricultural abstract
of the fields.
Intricate,
neat and orderly.
The windows
gleamed like drops of solder —
everything was wired up.
I thought of wedding presents,
white tea things
grouped on a dresser,
as we entered the cloud
and were nowhere —
a bride in a veil, laughing 
at the sense of event, only
half afraid of an empty house
with its curtains boiling
from the bedroom window.
TheMeteorological Lighthouse at O —
The speedboat ducks and drakes
through quiet seas to where
the lighthouse stands
like a salt cellar by Magritte,
dwarfing the keeper
who figure-eights our rope
around the bleak iron bollards.
As the boat drifts off,
they take the strain
and the line rips clear,
leaving the sea
like an opened envelope…
One side of the keeper's face
is so badly disfigured
he looks at my feet
when he talks about the lighthouse.
The whole place is homesick —
even his scalded cheek,
with its pallid impression
of ferns and grass
as if he'd fallen asleep
outdoors and only just woken.
But the lighthouse is insomniac,
he says, and I can believe him:
its sleepy staircase
turns forever,
unable to settle down.
To pass the time, he knits
all kinds of patterns
and embroiders equations
on the lighthousc computer.
It memorizes everything,
a bottom drawer full
of phantom baby things.
He shows me a garden
through his telescope —
wearing its greenhouse
like an engagement ring.
The New Hospital
It might be a space ship
invented for nothing
but the longest journey
to a different world:
luxuriant flowerbeds
of brilliant dials
keep a constant spring
with electrical bees.
Even the lavatories
create a myth of peace —
porcelain pelicans
repeat to infinity,
glittering mermaids sit
side-saddle on basins,
and each urinal calmly
sucks its peppermint…
A foetus in free fall
drifts through formaldehyde
forever, as if it was
the slow, golden bubble
in a spirit-level.
It knows neither illness
nor the painful pull
of gravity, the force 
in tartan dressing gowns
and slippers like orphans
the patients cannot leave.
But, before they arrive,
death seems old-fashioned,
a drowsiness and dream
of children duelling
with flintlock bananas…
The Trout Farm
The trout are silent choristers,
singing for our supper
a cold-blooded requiem mass,
though every one's throat is cut.
Death is a young Elizabethan lad
who shambles across the yard,
his waders shrunk to buckets
round each ankle.
For him,
the trout are stacked in rows
like a crate of open-mouthed empties,
waiting to be carted away.
He doesn't see their soft Vandykes
or the beautifully tarnished mail
as glorious as a silver spoon
that changes to sombre indigo
at the touch of an ordinary egg…
He kills them scientifically.
At the touch of a switch,
they become rigidly ridiculous,
aristocrats with monocles,
shocked as a Bateman cartoon
when some bounder mentions death.
The boy turns to offer me
a miniature organ of cigarettes…
Facts of Life
Wasps with Donald McGill bathing suits
were learning to swim in my cider glass.
A wagtail nervously patted the crease
and noted the way the field was placed,
while the cat crouched low for a catch.
A spider adjusted his cricket nets
for the padded-up bees and two ants
were ragging a dead fly in the grass
where a windfall lay with rusty sockets,
alas, poor Laxton, bored to death…
That afternoon, too, we watched a bat —
one of Hermann Rorschach's ink blots
flicked from nowhere into the drive,
as we dawdled our way back home.
My pupils saw an old tormented master,
in full subfusc, dying of cancer
and screaming like a gargoyle still
about some lesson we wouldn't learn.
We wanted to know the facts of life.
After all these years, his answer:
the bat gave birth and ate the foetus
with steadily working, sticky jaws…
Yards away, on the cellar steps,
a thrush jiggled a snail in its pram.
Memories of the Linen Room
‘Fetch me the handkerchief; my mind misgives…’
— Othello III.
iv.
89.
In the dormitory, boys laced up
their rugby boots like parcels,
knowing the mud outside would add
that final touch of sealing wax.
It's taken them twenty years
to be delivered by an accident:
I see a pint of gritty mussels
for sale and think of wet boots
on the changing-room floor.
The fishmonger's cold red hands
are locked in a scrum and I feel
a strange nostalgie de la boue,
for mud stamped to a solitaire board,
as if a puzzle were suddenly solved.
My hair still wet from the shower,
I'm going again to the linen room.
Daylight glows under a door
like the bar of an electric fire.
Inside are six ironed handkerchiefs
that represent home to a boy 
for whom almost anything will do,
except the matron's labrador
bending by the bicycle sheds
to its inch of lipstick
the colour of rhubarb.
He comes
instead to the linen room, this boy
whose heart is like a bathing suit,
heavy with sand and salty water,
five hundred miles from the sea.
The Train Set
‘The SS went to a great deal of trouble on the public relations side: there was background music, lorries ready to transport women, children and the infirm, while prisoners were at hand to act as porters; in short an atmosphere of relative welcome greeted the Jews when they got out of the cattle trucks…’
— Lucien Steinberg: Jews Against Hitler
A broken buffer rolls
in the palm of my hand,
like a collar stud
retrieved from history.
I take out two bridges,
goose-pimpled with rivets,
and notice that a child
has cleverly blackened
the underside of one
with smoke from a candle.
There is a trunk, labelled
WINDSOR, ENGLAND, EXPRESS,
but the tracks were made
in Germany.
Fit them
together how you will,
they form a pretzel…
Better just to leave them
in confusion, in the sad
geometry of flight.
They will never recede 
like a xylophone.
On the little trolley
for Bucher & zeitungen ,
the papers are in scale:
De Telegraaf ‘s date
is 4th of Feb, 1929.
The fine print bulges
under the dealer's glass,
as if I were looking
through unbidden tears.
Die Woche advertises
PARKER Duofold Pens
below the photograph
of a skiing girl
who tucks away her sticks
like a sergeant major.
The signal still salutes
as smartly as ever,
with the reds and greens
of a medal ribbon.
All the rolling stock
is in mint condition,
perfect on barbell wheels:
Nichtraucher, Schlafwagen,
Raucher, Deutsches Benzin.
I fiddle with the couplings
like a father dressing
his child in a hurry,
the spinal column there,
alive, under my hands.
I'm suddenly touching
a boy in pyjamas,
the ghost in the machine.
Here is the key that makes
those pistons shadow-box
so fast and uselessly.
