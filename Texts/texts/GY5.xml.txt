Are you?
Yeah.
Well that's what I've er she said I've got to come and see you first.
Oh I see, right, that's fine, yeah.
Right, let's have a look, whereabouts is it?
I've got two actually   There's one there.
Ee.
It's er, yeah that should be fine, we shouldn't have any great problem with that.
Yeah, the other one?
The other one is this high, that's a 
Yeah, well we could do the same with both of those.
They're both, they're both, neither of them are actually warts, okay?
They're both rather fleshy skin tanks.
Skin tanks.
There's two ways of doing this, you can either put some local anaesthetic in and actually burn them off, but that often leaves a bit of a scar.
Or you can actually try freezing them to kill them and then they just drop off on their own.
And that's 
Mm.
probably the neater mes method of the two.
And certainly the easiest for you.
Erm I'd probably give it a go on freezing first, the only thing about the freezing is sometimes it doesn't work first time.
But that'd be the tidiest thing for you.
And we 
Mm.
can get that set up.
Now I'm actually, there isn't another session now until the week after next, cos I'm actually away next week.
Mm.
Er er but then we'll have more sessions booked in, we can just slot you in to one of those I should think.
Yeah.
There's someone away all August but I'm actually going to try to keep the sessions going,
Yeah.
cos there's actually quite a demand for them.
Yeah.
Well I'm away 
So 
er twenty second of August again so 
Yeah.
er what will you do, let me know?
Or
No, what we'll do is go and actually get you booked in.
Oh.
So twenty one, where are we?
Twenty first, so if we got you booked in for that.
Follow 
 
me.
Yeah.
Follow me.
As I said we may not have a  set up but if we haven't we'll set one now.
