listen in to everything which is
Oh right.
said.
If I can get you to scrawl your signature and today's date which is the twenty fifth on there.
Right, is your signature readable?
Ah could you print your name


it's just that she needs your name, the fact that you're male,th an approximate age within five years.
that information.
Erm  basically
Oh right er twenty five plus.
I don't know why people are a bit 
 
touchy about their ages to be perfectly honest.
You know.
erm what is your job basically?
You're a
Well I suppose I'm a a blind salesman.
Salesman
Blind salesman, that sounds good doesn't it.
And fitter.
I fit it as well.
And fitter.
Right.
So I have to make sure it's measured right.
You can't blame anybody else for anything can you .
 
Okay that's lovely thanks very much.
Right.
Right,it's not gonna 
 
fall down on your plants.
If you get the middle about the middle of it.
Dead in the middle, yeah.
Or alive in the middle as they say.


You want that supported .
Right.
That is   right thank you.
with the lights fading, it's gonna be five o'clock in half an hour's time, feed the dogs just before five and then see you you see.
I was a bit quicker in Newark than I thought.
It's a good place to be quicker in.
 

delicate measurements.
Yeah well we don't want it brushing on your
The trouble is I'm quite sure that the plasterers never did that.
They they just slop it up don't they.
Yeah.
There is a bit of difference actually.
Yeah.
Yes there is quite a bit of difference 
Well we realized that when we had the windows changed.
Yes I
Mm.
I haven't quite finished wallpapering, I don't think that's gonna make a lot of difference is it to the .
Right, I've got a range of prices.
Erm
Essentially we need to know what what you can do and what you can't do and
Right.
What's av We've never ever bought a blind.
Right.
Now what kind of colour were you looking for?
White.
White.
It must be white.
I don't think anything else is going to .
Er that's our reduced one.
That would be sixty nine pounds.
Mhm.
What are they made of?
Erm well they're usually
Or doesn't that matter.
Well i a they're all polyester or
Yeah.
erm some are fibreglass.
.
Yeah.
. These are the washable ones.
Mm.
These are the most expensive.
Mhm.
These have just come in in the last year.
Bu I mean I'd only advise those if you have like er you know, children with grubby hands and
Or smokers.
Or sm whatever yeah, where it's gonna get really dirty .
 
And we don't have children with grubby hands .
No it's just you.
Well you see with those you can stick them in the washing machine.
Mm.
And your dryer and you can iron them.
Right, these are your whites.
Erm I'll tell you how we price them.
Erm the higher up it goes, the more expensive it is.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
With anything.
That's a C you see, that would one 
Mhm.
Erm that's an A, that would be ninety eight ad so on.
Aha right.
Yeah.
have a look 
I quite like that sort of texture actually, that's you know that's quite  
Oh yes yes that's quite nice that is.
 

Which is a D.
Yeah.
Mm.
See it's quite nice but 
We've got just a bit of sun.
.
I can't see the difference between that one and the one that was .
Oh yes there is, this is slightly closer weave.
Mm.
It just depends how difficult they are to weave and that that usually makes them you know, more expensive.
And if it's a difficult pattern.
Well we wanted something that you know, wasn't just completely plain white, that had got either 
Yeah.
a bit of texture or a pit of pattern in it when the light's shining through it.
We've got some beiges as well that a few are quite sort of close to white.
Yeah.
I mean if you're interested in one I'll take one out because
Well
if you hold them up to the light then you see them  
Yes and then you see through  That one's got a
You'll have to hold it up to 
Yeah.
in front of that light then
Mm.
you can see it 
Mm.
Yes this is probably  see them at night time.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
I quite quite like that that one.
Which I think is the same.
Well on theirs I'm allowed to give you a discount, I  bring that down to a B. The higher up you're going.
Yeah.
I mean I can get a bit more off you see.
Right.
So I can give you a B a B price for that one.
It's difficult to say well I mean suppose with all of these, the the light  the sunlight is going to
Mm.
is gonna be diffused enough isn't it.
Mm.
Yeah yeah.
Cos you can see
Yes it's
see quite a bit through.
Mm.
that one.
Well that would make  
Yes you can yes.
But it's it it would still 
denser.
it would still you know erm  stop stop the sunlight from you know,
Mm.
spoiling your T V programs or something.
Yeah.
Or stopping it from rotting the furniture.
Yeah my main er our main problem is the  
Oh right yeah.
carpet because this this stuff does fade rather.
You're probably better off with something with a bit more texture to it then.
Mm.
A bit denser.
more open weave isn't it.
thicker 
I mean they will they will protect your furniture it's just that they'll take all the battering then from the sun.
Mm.
Mm.
I know white will probably d discolour a bit won't it.
Over
It's erm
a long period of time, I mean we give a guarantee of two years on material.
Mm.
And a ten year guarantee on the headrail.
So
Mm 
If in the future you wanted just to change your louvres,
Yeah.
you know, you can do that.
You can do it that way and it works out a lot cheaper.
H how much do the louvres cost as a proportion 
 
of the
Erm I think it's about half.
Yeah.
It's about half yeah.
So you could you could replace the blind if you redecorated and changed the colour 
Oh yeah.
scheme or something like that for about half the price.
Yeah.
It doesn't look like 
Yeah they don't call them  other than beige and white and .
I'm assuming that the that when they're actually made, when they're cut, they are actually cut absolutely dead straight on the  the grain of the erm the weave.
Yeah.
or otherwise you you know
No no they're gonna be dead straight.
Er well it would be absolutely wouldn't they ?
Yes yes.
It's just that some of these of course, the ones that have got like a square textured,
No you wouldn't get any sort 
They'd look a bit funny if they were sort of 
They would they would look weird if they weren't exactly.
Mm.
Oh no they'd they'd be cut like you see them there .
Perfect yeah.
If I got something and it wasn't
The price includes VAT,
Yeah.
includes the fitting.
What's the waiting time?
The weighting?
Wh 
How long to wait?
Oh the waiting time.
Sorry I thought you were talking about the weights on the
Oh no no no.
Erm it's two to three weeks
Yeah.
maximum.
Erm if it's if you're desperate for them we can rush it in
Yeah.
a bit bit quicker.
Mm.
That one is not bad .
It's slightly it's slightly  I don't know I I still like that one actually I mean w 
There probably isn't no.
That's liable to catch the dust a bit more than that I suppose.
Mm.
Well you've got to brush on the  
When they Yeah 
As long as you do them fairly regularly, you're not going to have any problems as far as erm  
That's acrylic and the other one you were looking at was fibreglass.
Mm.
Yes it yes it  
 
No I still like that one actually.
Yeah.
Well it's you know, it's up to you you can look at whatever.
I'd give you the discount on that as well.
The lakes one was an E
No it was a it was an E I think.
Oh an E.
I think it was an E
That would be a hundred and fifty two,two hundred and thirty eight.
I'm not so keen on that much of a  St I still prefer that.
It's difficult isn't it when you've got a 
Well too much choice 
bit of choice.
is is is fatal isn't it ?
We've got Spice and we've got Snowdrop and the expense what was the expensive one?
Dune.
.
You like that?
Yeah.
Dune.
It's just got some .
Yeah it wouldn't wouldn't matter if it was cut slightly off square either would it.
Well it's not quite  
 
and you get the dunes effect when you've
Mm.
when you've got them all up .
Yeah.
Oh they th 
Well of course you will won't you because you're gonna go right the way across.
Always assuming they match together.
Well no they wouldn't match together but that doesn't matter.
Erm might might be a problem for you.
No it wouldn't be a problem might be a problem for a my mother
Er your mother yes.
Mm.
Mm.
So what would that
Well I'll drop that down to a C, that'd be a hundred and fourteen.
A hundred and fourteen.
Mm.
Cos that looks quite a nice one.
Mm.
I want something really that's not absolutely completely dead plain.
Mm.
Well
Because it's quite a bit window.
Yeah.
I think  mind you the rest of the walls, everything else is white so
Want something that's a bit interesting in your living room don't you.
Yeah.
You know, depending on what kind of decor you have.
But you've got white walls
Yes.
Well I I don't think we can go on any other sort of colour.
Mm.
Cos I think a big expanse of something that matched this would be awful really.
Well I was just I was just thinking, if you had a patterned paper and then you had you're pattern in your
Yeah.
your blind as well 
 
Well yes, I think we'll have to stick to white .
I think that's .
The background .
Mm.
well we've got some sort of sorting out and thinking to do haven't we?
Yeah, what about the erm  oh what do you call the top bit of the rail?
Oh the the rail
The erm.
Yes erm.
Wh which side do do do they go to the side?
They actually go, you can have them at either side,
Yeah.
erm you can have your controls at either side, the bunch going to either side.
And you can
Can you have it going from the middle?
You can have the bunch splitting.
Cos it being a big window I think 
Yeah.
it's better.
I'll just tell you about if you have it splitting.
Mhm.
Erm the two middle louvres that come together will overlap slightly more than the others.
Yeah.
Right.
So the shadow w when the sun's shining 
You can see a slightly thicker one.
becomes sl er slightly larger.
Mm.
That's the only er difference with those.
But if er if it all going to one side I think it's going to be take up half the window won't it .
I think it could be very heavy here wouldn't it.
Mm.
look better going.
It wouldn't quite take up it wouldn't take up half the window .
Wouldn't it?
No.
But a fair amount.
It also depends if you have your windows open and you've got them each side and a bit of a wind, they'll be flapping .
Yeah.
Mm.
think about that as well.
Mm I I I still think  the middle.
You want it to open from the middle?
Yeah.
It's this sense of proportion isn't it?
No it's not really  what I prefer.
Yes.


Right.
And what about the bottoms?
Presumably they're chained .
They're they're they're all chained together
Mm.
with weights.
And they they go a hundred and eighty
Yeah.
degrees?
That's right yeah.
Cos obviously that's quite necessary .
Mm yeah.
The way the sun comes.
Which end do you want to have the controls?
Well it would have to be this end.
You want the controls this end?
No no sorry same end as the other one, same end yes the same end .
 
Yeah it's a bit more difficult to get in there isn't it.
Do you want to order now or do you want a quote?
Could you quote ?
Probably the best is a quote .
 
And then we'll 
Cos we've got one more person to talk to
Right.
yet.
Okey-doke.
.
if you can give us the the two alternatives for the the Dunes one and the  Spice
Oh I'd better just er .
So it's the Dunes is the 
That one.
that one.
The dunes is the preferred one.
Is the preferred one.
And then there's the Spice.
Mm.
And was it the Snowdrop?
No.
just those two?
Just those two.
I like the texture of that other one .
Which one?
That well the .
The Spice one.
Spice one but er
Yeah.
You like the pattern of the Dunes one.
Well no it's not that I just think it's the I don't know  you can see through it more.
Yeah.
I 
Is it Mr ?
yeah.
As in the flower.
And the address again please.
.
And your phone number?
is .
Why am I saying all these .
With the er white headrail or chocolate brown?
White.
White?
White .
That doesn't make any difference to price  does it?
No.
What width are the are the vanes of the the louvres.
Er they're five inch.
Yeah.
These are three and a half so they'd be slightly longer.
Yeah yeah.
Slightly wider.
Mhm.
Well I hope they will be slightly longer.
.
Yeah.
Right .
You want it split?
Yeah.
And you want it er controls on the
Left.
And the other one was Spice White.
Right I'll write this out again and if you decide to go ahead,
Yeah.
then just cross the one out you don't want.
Okay.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Otherwise you get two.
Yeah.
Which could be quite fun.
Well you you'd have no problem with sun penetration then would you.
No you're right dear.
No.
That would be 
We already have a roller blind on the outside
I see
which is useful for taking the heat off the window itself in the Summer.
Yeah.
But it doesn't have any effect
It doesn't take the light off.
.
I mean that's got a very open weave texture.
Mm.
 

Ten  Right, I'll let you fill that in when you're
Okay yeah.
It's a Newark phone number, yeah?
Right.
There's a little bit more for you.
competition on the toes.




Right I'll give you these.
Right.
Erm if you want to go ahead with it, pull the top one off,
Yeah.
pop it into one of these prepaid envelopes
Right.
with the deposit in.
And it'll be twenty pound deposit.
Twenty pounds .
Mm.
Yeah.
And then as soon as our office gets that it'll be two to three weeks.
Right.
That says plus thirty, that's that's inclusive .
No  Well I'll just put it on.
Thought thought I'd better ask.
Yes yes .
Thank you.
and that'll be attached  and when we come to fit it, if you keep hold of the one you keep
Yeah.
you needn't sign that now 
It looks a bit complicated but
No no.
No not really.
got the idea.


Well that's marvellous thank you.
I've been thinking about these blinds for such a long time.
Yeah.
Really just I mean a roller blind's just too the window's too wide for a roller blind.
And then at least you can see through while you're shading the sun from that direction and then 
That's right yeah.
the other direction.
seemed to be the answer.
Well  thank you very much.
Yes, you've got your measure.
I've got my measure yeah.
Yeah.
I've just well and truly broken mine, you know I chipped the end of the 
Yeah.
tape on the  it went and did it again on me now and it's well and truly gone I'll have to buy another one.
It was a nice idea.


put this back.
Oh don't worry it's very very it's very easy.
There you go.
They're all on rollers these days.
Oh right.
Right thank you very much indeed.
Hello there goes the phone .
I'll answer it dear  
Right okay.
