The Communist Party
HARD times
The scenes of hooliganism that ended the football season are all too likely to be repeated as England's most notorious export reaches the shores of Italy.
And yet, it is within the much maligned football community that we have seen a model of resistance to the break-up of society.
The Football Supporters Association have set out on a project to democratise the game, taking control of the clubs and institutions that so ruthlessly exploit their support.
Acid House comes a close second to football fans in the tabloids' top ten of moral panics.
And again, it is the subject community, this time party-goers, who have developed new forms of the collective in the face of Thatcherite authoritarianism.
Thatcher's children, one and all, it is these generations who feel the need to belong to new collectivities, connected to the energy of PEOPLE-POWER, the key phrase for the 90s.
How can the Left be transformed by these new forms?
As hard times turn to iron times this is an urgent question.
A politics of the future has to engage with, learn from, the new, never to be simply satisfied with tracking opinion polls or empty gestures but empowering those who have been left cold by all our agendas.

The Fire Brigades Union
General Secretary Ken Cameron
Executive Council of Fire Brigades Union are extremely concerned at, and are opposed to the War in the Gulf.
At a time when all progressive people in the world are looking forward to reaping the benefits of the peace dividend, a War based on the economy of he West is unnecessary and unacceptable.
There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is an evil tyrant who has murdered, tortured and imprisoned any opposition to his regime.
It is essential however, that the conditions be created for Iraq's withdrawal from its illegal occupation and a permanent resolution to the Gulf crisis.
This should take the form of:–
(1)
An immediate ceasefire.
(2)
A buffer force consisting of a U.N.
peace keeping force.
(3)
The immediate setting up of a Conference representing all interested parties in the region to bring about a resolution to the Palestinian problem and a programme of disarmament on an equal basis throughout the region.
INTERNATIONAL CITIZENS APPEAL FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM ON THE MIDDLE EAST
We are individuals, representatives of citizens groups and social movements.
We are appalled by the list of crimes committed by Saddam Hussein throughout his bloody career.
We are also deeply opposed to the violence of the Western response, the initiation of war before all alternative possibilities had been exhausted, the way in which the presentation of his war conceals the real effects upon civilian society an the manipulation of the United Nations on behalf of a small number of states, instead of an instrument of peace and security on behalf of the whole world community.
This war is poisoning the world.
It could mark the beginning of a new North-South confrontation that replaces the old East- West confrontation as a way of organising global relations.
The war muffles the voices of humanity, of ordinary people who care about democracy, material well being, the protection of nature, and above all, human life.
WE CALL UPON ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO JOIN US IN WORKING FOR THE FOLLOWING GOALS:
An immediate ceasefire, retaining sanctions until Iraq withdraws from Kuwait
A Middle East peace conference which will address the full range of problems in the region and promote democracy, respect for human rights and reconciliation between the different communities.
Reform of the United Nations so as to work towards greater representativeness, accountability and independence.
The Gulf war has shown that we cannot rely on Governments or International Institutions acting on their own.
It is up to citizens working together to initiate a long term process of communication, mutual support and joint action.
We invite all those who support this appeal to take part.

The Gulf Peace Team
WE ARE AN INTERNATIONAL MULTICULTURAL TEAM WORKING FOR PEACE AND OPPOSING ANY FORM OF AGGRESSION, PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE BY ANY PARTY IN THE GULF.
The GULF PEACE TEAM maintained a non-violent presence in the war zone on the Saudi/Iraqi border through the opening phase of the Coalition Offensive in the face of extreme uncertainty and danger.
However, on 27th January the Camp was compulsorily evacuated by the Iraqi officials.
We have established a fine, independent reputation in the region and will continue to express a world wide desire for peace through two new International camps to be sited on significant border locations.
In addition the GULF PEACE TEAM will be working with two international relief agencies to ensure proper distribution of medical aid and special foodstuffs to civilian victims of war.
In order to implement this progress we urgently need more funding, and as we are entirely dependent on private donations ask you, please to send whatever you can.
