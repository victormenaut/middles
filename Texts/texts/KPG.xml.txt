That was good.
Well, it's about these two women and one of them's married and the other one's, like, she's got a boyfriend.
And they go on holiday  and they're not supposed to, you know, they neither of them of told their boyfriend they go in this club  and one of them, the married one, starts dancing with this man and like he, he thinks cos she's dancing with him she likes him but she's just having fun.
So he takes her outside and tries to rape her and the other one comes up with a gun and she says let her go.
And he goes, he lets her go and everything and he goes, and when they walk away he goes stupid bitch!
He goes I should've just fucked her!
So she goes what did you say?
He said cu suck my cock!
And she shoots him.
So they're running away from the police  and then they get all this money.
But the money gets nicked, so  the one who's married, she goes and robs erm a store  and then, they, the policeman pulls them over and wants to take them in so they lock him in his boot.
And then this man keeps driving past them and he keeps, like, making sexual remarks at them, so they pull him over and he, she goes don't ever do that to them again.
He goes you two are fucking crazy bitches!
And as he walks away they, he's ran because his lorry is filled with petrol and they blow it up.
And then they got the police chasing them.
It's really good.
It's sad at the end.
Do they get caught?
Pardon?
Do they get caught?
No, they die.
Because  if they went back they'd have to have the electric chair and they don't want the electric chair or the, cos that's what they think cos they've done so much.
So they come to a cliff  and she looks at her and she goes, she goes what are you doing?
She's getting a gun out and she goes I'm not going out without a fight.
She goes no, let's not.
Let's keep going.
So they drive over a cliff and it finishes.
When they got the policeman she shot him.
She goes what did you do that for?

And my cousin's sitting with a spider mhm nice little spider  nasty!
I can understand like you  picking one up to get rid of it if you're not scared of it, but playing with one, keeping it as a pet!

She knows Jane and that lot.
Oh.

I suppose everyone has but I hear about her a lot.
In school and everything.
Which one was that?
Pardon?
Which one was this?
The skinny one.
But, like Geraldine's two-faced cos she's always giving it like erm, to other people, I don't like Lucy, the one she hangs about with, I only hang about with her cos I feel sorry for her.

Oh God!
It's not like, have you seen it?
Yeah.
Donna's one?
Have you seen Kelly's one?
No.
Kelly's one is like, I only got a glimpse of it, but I'm sure it's like Donna's one.
Gone and spoilt her hair, man.
She was so pretty, innit?
She was getting tall, nice blue eyes and then she goes and does that.
It looks alright, but it looked better when it was long.
Yeah.
Not when it was permed, just when it was long and blonde.
And Kelly's looked better when it was short and curly.
Shave off the head  
Who?
Kelly?
Yeah.
Think so.
She's got a reputation too.
I mean, the difference is, I've never heard anything about Donna, do you know what I mean?
Nobody's ever said but with Kelly, people have said things to me.
With Ian?
All the time?
I mu I mean I must admit, must admit.
Yeah 
You know in Big Ben?
You know there's a car park
Yeah.
They're always in there.
Late I must admit lately I haven't seen her with, I haven't 
Yeah.
haven't seen her with him.
I must admit.
I've seen Donna with him.
But I haven't seen her with him for ages!
Yeah.
And I haven't really seen his car a lot lately either.
Yeah.
If I think about it I haven't seen him at all.
I haven't seen him at all.
An I saw Kelly about two week's ago, no, about a month ago.
What are they doing?
She still living there?
Yeah, I think so yeah.
She hangs about with some erm half-ca I think she's black but she, she's light.
I don't know if she's half-caste but 
but she liv I saw her Nan the other day and like her Nan, I don't  cos her Nan always invites me round.
She goes, come round and see me!
I goes, with Kelly?
I don't talk to Kelly no more.
I goes, she goes, yeah, you two were really close and then you just, her Kelly, her Nan doesn't obviously know that Kelly's a little bitch, do you know what I mean?
Cos it was Kelly that like, said, yeah, you're my best friend, do you know what I mean, and then made me say Kelly's my best friend, do you know what I mean?
Cos I used to look up to her cos she was older than me.
So I don't think her Nan really knows that Kelly does it to loads of people, do you know, cos she was Geraldine's best friend, Katie's best friend.
She was 
I don't 
I don't know she just, she, she goes you're too immature.
Cos you know how I hang about with you lot a lot when I was younger and we used to like climbing roofs and everything, she goes you're too immature.
She started this water fight with Kevin, she was throwing wet tissue at him and cos I got good at it she goes you're too immature.
I goes right then.
She goes you'd better go.
I said yeah I will.
And I walked out and then she didn't call me and I didn't call her and that was it.
Simple at that.
Cos my Mum wouldn't let me call her.
She goes  you're not calling her up again.
No way!
She looks like she's desperate.
No, but  Donna, Donna, it looks alright on Donna, but Kelly just looks    Been going Georgie's lately getting all posters off of him.
What ?
I got erm, Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Universal Soldiers and  and he was offering me all Jean Claude Van Damm ones 
Is it?
You know the one where her top's ripped open you can see her leg.
Oh yeah.
that one.
He was offering me that one.
And he's got all nude pictures.
Della!
There's me, I was going, you dirty man!
Della!
I goes you hang it up in your shower, innit?
He goes yeah.
He goes do you wanna come and see?
Listen to me, I goes no thanks.
Such a pervert!
 
He's always got young girls in there with him.
 
I wanna know what he does!
But he's always
Della!
Here, I mean I've seen like, ten-year-old girls in there, but really pretty ten-year-old girls, you know what I mean, blue eyes and blonde hair from them flats.
Yeah.
And you go in there and they give you dirty looks, you know.
And you're looking at a video and they sit there looking at you like that  
Have you seen one with black hair, black hair, short?
Yeah, I think so.
She's really small.
Yeah, I think I have.
I don't like it when they're sitting on the floor in front of the counter with their legs like that and they're sitting there and you're looking at the video and you think, well, I can't get that because that was made in nineteen-eighty-six and they might think I'm a bit weedy, so I better get something that was made  recently.
That's why when I, when I go round the video shop on my own I usually go Jordans.
Cos I don't like going in there on my own I feel intimidated.
He's alright to talk to but he's such a little pervert!
You see him, cos he's, Nick goes can I have a poster?no, they're only for erm the prettiest girl in Clapton and he shook my hand and sort of giving it yeah,before he drags me behind the counter!
But he had all these nudy pictures.
Because I wanted Aliens three.
Yeah.
If you can get an Aliens three poster for me I'll pay you for it.
One where the Alien's at her face.
But erm, and I was looking through all these posters and most of them were of nude women!
And I said, George, ain't you got any nude men?
I said because at least you could have some nude men for me!
And listen, he goes, yeah, I've got nude men hanging up in my shower, he goes, do you wanna come?
That was what he said, he said they're hanging up in my shower, do you wanna come and see them?
Listen, I goes, yeah, anytime.
Cos Shelley was there.
And Shelley was a joke, man.
She goes in there, she's sitting looking at him  like that, she just stares at  him.
Just to make sure, you know what I mean?
When anyone's like that with me or with one of my friends she just sits there looking at you because, cos she's big, she's kind of threatening sometimes, you know what I mean?
She's sitting there with a fag hanging out her mouth.
She just sits there staring at him saying you make any funny moves you'll see what you get.
Oh Shelley's  She's erm, she's on a diet.
Oh really?
She's lost about three stone.
It's good.
I mean, you probably wouldn't see it but I can see it, she's losing it.
Cos she's quite pretty actually if she lost weight.
I'm gonna get her to go jogging with bin liners strapped to her bum!
I could  listen, I'd go, why's her bum so crinkly, like, when Jane comes.
Oh yeah.
This is Jane, she's got a bin liner to make her bum sweat  I thought she needs it.
I don't know why your sister bothers she's alright.
She just needs to cut back on her chocolate.
She love her chocolate, innit?
Yeah!
Went to see Forever Young  with Mel Gibson, the one where he's frozen for fifty years and then he wakes up in

He, he's smart.
That man is smart.
Innit?
When he takes the man's face he puts it, ah, it was so bad!
I
That was really smart  
I'd just read the book as well.
The book's better than the film cos it's got more detail in it.
But that was nasty man, he wants to make her tit  Urgh!
Urgh!
And when he's dancing he takes his clothes off and, and he's pinned up and he's going like and he's going

But it's out on the balcony a lot.

But tonight I'll prob tomor like yesterday I went to bed at about ten and you can hear it calling out, crying out there.
I have to go to bed early and then Mum gets me up in the morning she's going get up!

cos my alarm clock goes off at half-seven, it goes cockle-doodle-doo!
And you push it and she goes good morning!
And you  go shut up!
And then my Mum goes, eight o'clock I still ain't up, my Mum goes get out of bed.

On Monday to go to school I could not get up!
Cos you know my,
 
my brother and sister went away for the week, right,

Cos usu when they go away, cos they're not going away this weekend, but when they go away you should come down cos the flat's quiet and I ain't got nothing to do, sit and play my computer.
And  it was just so brilliant!
I could leave everything lying about on the floor and nothing would get broken!
I could leave a Madonna tape in the middle of the room and no one would rip it!
I'd sit and watch it, you know, just put it there, sit and watch it.
It was brilliant!
I could watch telly and actually hear what Jim was saying in Neighbours.
It was amazing!
I've never, I've never ever heard Jim's voice before.
Haven't you?
Never!
Cos  every time Jim talks 


or my sister gives it  Sam!
Let go of my hair!
And he's pulling her    EastEnders today this child is mad!
You know them hopper things you bounce on, the round balloon thing?
She's got one, it's flat, it's not flat but it's kind of deflated, she's getting er, doing handstands on it and she's going  my head, it's my head   
 
My brother's, my brother's doing a handsta er sitting on his head on the chair.
He's going, Jo, don't leave me on my head all night, and I'm going, shut up!
And Mum's going, don't talk to him like that, and I'm going, they're driving me mad!
They get up at eight o'clock in the morning and say,Jo, I want my cereal.
And you say  how many Weetabix do you want, one?
No, no, no, two.
Sam, how many Weetabix do you want, one?
Make up you bloody mind!
And  say  I want Rice Crispies  You pour the Rice Crispies  no, no, Cornflakes  I don't want no sugar on them today.
I do want sugar, I can't have them now they've gone all soggy in the water, in the milk!
Oh god!
You just want to tell them to go home!
Go, go away from me!
You're so lucky!
In the summer holidays  I can, I can get up early if I want to.

On school days I just feel like sleeping!
But I like, you know the weekend, Saturday?

But when Sam  I could put it on in the bedroom and sit and watch it and Sunday, I get up on Sundays and that that cat's ugly  I get up Sundays now  because Grange Hill's on.
Have you seen it?
The 
No.
first ever series of Grange Hill with 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mark out of EastEnders.
I get up to watch that now cos I, and The Rut, The Rug Rats, the little baby and his, I think that's so funny.
It's a little cartoon, it's just cheap and enj like Bart Simpson kind of.
Oh 
Have you seen it?
Yeah, I think I did see it.
It's kind of stupid but it's kind of funny if you know what I mean cos the baby don't talk and as soon as the Mum and Dad's out of the room it's  let's go and find the chocolate.
It's so funny.
But oh, erm  your dog's attacking a car I just thought I'd tell you.
 
Shadow.
Oh that's good, cos Dempsey'll stay in there for ages now if she pisses all over there.
Dempsey, oh, cos by the wall, right, and you know how he digs up the floor
Yeah.
when he's finished?
I walked past, mouthful of dirt!
Where Dempsey's kicking dirt up in my face so I go, what're you doing?
Looks at me and he goes  I hate him so much!
I hate it  you stand there and you not doing nothing  
Innit?
And they're just looking at you!
And they're just looking at you and your Mum s your Mum wants you to take him out properly, walk him down the street and you've sneaked him outside and they're just looking at you like this 
I hate it when they do that.
With that, with that expression and like when a cat you go puss puss puss to a cat 
Oh yeah.
and you're calling it for ages but you can't go near it cos it will run away and it goes like this to you, it goes 
and it goes like that and it goes 
 
yeah, and it cuts its eye at you and then you go to get it, it goes I'll jump, I'll bloody  jump.
 
I got a cat trapped up here, right, it was chasing Jones and I goes I got you now, and he jumped over the wall.
Did it?
From here, listen, I goes I've got you now.
This is the cat  over the wall and I hate, Jones always 
Did he make it?
Mm?
Yeah!
I it, and it jumped back up and, it didn't jump back up, it jumped, what it done is it ran down that bit of the wall and jumped.
And Jane, this is Jane to me the other day, throw your kitten off my floor and see if it lands on  its feet.
 



I hate it cos when I call Jones she stands on the wall like that, right.
She's sitting down
Mm.
and you go to her   and she just looks at you like, I'll come, and you go,and you go closer


and you go Jones, come here and you  come here!
She goes  like that, she cuts her eye at you, right.
She'll go up to you and she goes  she looks at you like that and her eyes are all wide,sh sh she's looking down at the wall like that to make sure it's all clear, you know what I mean?
She's going  she's looking at you and you go, come here, you take a step further and she gives you a dirty look and then she waits until you're that close and then she jumps!
So the other day, you know what I done?
What?
I jumped over the other side of the wall, so if she jumps she'd have to 
Oh!
I walked up to her, you know what she done?
What?
She jumped the other way round and ran all the way round the back.
I hate cats!
Some cat was climbing through a window and it weren't going.
Mum got scared   
 
and he weren't scared  
That was, that was what erm Dempsey done to Jane and Mussy.
You when American Werewolf come on T V for the first time?
Yeah.
And you gotta admit that was scary, that film, even 
Yeah.
when I watch it now I get scared, especially the bit when she goes like that and he goes aargh I get, I get scared.
That's the end of it, yeah.
Yeah.
Right, well, you know how Dempsey used to scratch on the door?
Mm.
Well we weren't in and Dempsey always used to go up to Jane, right?
Yeah.
So Mussy and that lot had just watched American Werewolf and they hear  outside.
Della!
Come here!
Oh no.
Della!
Come here!
She's going in the road.
Shelley, Shelley come round to me right, and she was, she was, she was stroking Dempsey and I walked in the room, this is Dempsey  and he walked past me wagging his, you know when they put the tail down and 
Yeah.
wag it?
Goes to say 
Don't beat me!
Innit?
 
And here's me, I'm looking at him, she's going you're so cool you beat your dog, innit?
I don't.
It's the kitten I beat up!
You know, I pick the kitten up I throw it in the air, catch it,
 
I go like that with it wooo!


I get her head, put it in my mouth.
I get her head and you know Beetlejuice when he goes  I gotta show you it cos sometimes she's, she's not alert and when she's like that it looks wicked cos he goes  and her ears are like that she goes  and I get her to play the banjo and she goes  it's wicked!
I just get her arms I go like that with her arm, right, and she just lets you do it, she just looks at you and says you're fucking mad and walks away.
You're playing with her right, and then you've finished and you put her down and she looks at you she goes, bloody sick!
She walks away and poufs her tail out like that.
You think go away, you mutt!
I hate animals.
I hate Nicky and Squeak as well.
Nicky just sits there giving it Squeak's face, Squeak grabs her foot Squeak goes  they start tumbling all about the cage, you can hear boof, boof, boof!
Yeah, but they always fight.
You know how we used to always fight and then, well they turn round, I didn't mean to smash your face in.
It's alright, Josie, I didn't mean to break your arm, do you know what I mean?
And then Squeak's so sneaky, I probably told you this where she gets Nicky and starts cleaning her.
Nicky loves it when Squeak cleans her, right, my rats and she gives it  and Nicky's getting all  and there's Squeak going 
 
in her neck  and then, and then it's all quiet right.
Say you're sleeping in the front room, as soon as you turn the light out and there's no sound  they don't shut up.
I'm sure they pick things up and throw them at each other.
I swear they're so loud it's like  it's like you know when you kick through a big pile 
Yeah.
of, big pile of leaves, it's like that.
Trying to sleep through a hurricane innit?
It was nasty.
It was like that night when I woke up and the hurricane was there, I couldn't turn my lights on or nothing I was shitting myself.
 
Yeah.
Remember when that tree fell down and it banged on Shelley's window and Shelley was giving it ah!
And Shelley come back with a knife.
She goes I'm gonna kill Mussy!
come to my bed 
No this is me, I was sitting in my bedroom cos I didn't, Sam and Fern weren't there innit?
I was in the bedroom on my own.
And I could hear  and I could hear  and I turned the light on and it wouldn't come on!
And my hands were going like this and I looked at my clock and it was about six o'clock and it was still pitch black because it  jump back into bed.
As simple as that.
 
I got back into bed, put the quilt over my head, turned over, I went to sleep.
I didn't even bother wake up when the alarm clock went I just left it ringing.
My Mum had to come in and turn it off.
Same as when Thriller first come out.
I had to sleep with the light on.
So Mum she come turn it off   But man, no when the hurricane come and Shelley come back with that knife, I'm gonna kill Mussy, I'm gonna kill Mussy.
Shelley, we're trying to eat our cheese on toast.
I said I'm gonna kill Mussy.
I'm gonna kill him.
Oh yeah!
You know he, he kicked her, she come back sitting there with a knife, I'm gonna kill Mussy.
 

That was funny.
I couldn't believe it, man, when Sam and Fern ran right up to him and he started running and screaming.
I remember when Rufus bit me I was shitting myself.
Did you see the, is it true?
Did you see the bite 
Oh yeah.
I've gotta show you that picture, it's that big, across the leg all blood dripping down off it.
Rufus just went  looked like a vampire attacked her.
Dempsey had tried to take on two dogs that he knocked out his tooth.
Knocked out his big canine tooth.
He's only got one now.
You know the big  
Oh yeah.
he's only got one now.
He tried to take two dogs on.
Just, the dog just went  knocked its collar and the tooth dropped out.
How?
cos he's got brown teeth as well.
I'm not brushing Dempsey's teeth he'll bite my hand off!
This is the vet to me he goes your dog's got brown teeth you got to brush it  brush the teeth  banged his tooth with the collar, he had a metal collar
Oh
Dempsey's tooth there's all blood coming out of his mouth I said see, serves you right.
sympathetic cos he was kicking the shit out of him.
Stupid dog!
And he tried to attack a pit bull.
Pit bull.
Round the shops.
He had a long-life lead on and I tried to grab the long-life lead  it burnt all my hand and he tried to attack the pit bull.
Luckily the man had the pit bull on a lead.
Kicked the shit out him.
I kicked him home I swear.
I kicked him and the long-life lead just come  I kicked him again.
Bastard.
That's what they do in that film.
The dog bends over.
No.
Shelley blows smoke in her dog's face.
Yeah.
She gets a smoke cos her, her brother smokes stuff and sometimes he gives it to her and she blows it in her dog's face.
And then she tried to put it in the washing machine for a joke and the dog was gonna get in.
The dog's so stupid.
That's what Robert does to Kelly   
Shelley's dog does that anyway.
right up on the roof .
That's what Roy done, you know why, he come into my house and I goes you better not come in my door he'll attack you.
And he goes, no I won't.
I let him use the toilet.
I goes, you better get out now and I tried to hold Dempsey back and he goes, he goes, that dog won't bite me, dogs love me.
Dempsey run up bit his leg open.
He went  and all his leg was bleeding.
I goes you better get a tetanus cos God knows what Dempsey's got.
There was a knuckle-duster with a knife, with a knife!
That's like some boys done in my school and they got caught and then they weren't allowed to go to the disco.
And they had big rocket things and they were throwing them.
One of them just missed the teacher's head.
Yeah?
We went along  not allowed to have a drink and all that.
And they brought them flick-knife combs.
You know when you flick them out and the teachers took them off of them.
Cos they said, one boy, a boy, a police officer the other times thought he saw a boy with a knife and he shot him.
So they took it off of him.
They thought they were all smart 
knuckle-duster I think.
This man had the hand like, in Freddy  if you could punch him you'd go  do you reckon he was there 
That cat won't come in, she never comes in the stupid bitch!
She just sits there  at me.
  
When your dogs were chasing her.
Is it?
Yeah, you know that  put it where  and the money just keeps dropping out 
Teachers, teachers,
Gonna get her!
all the teachers got drunk on the first night in France.
They come in singing out about twelve o'clock.
And they took all the shandy out of the machine.
Yeah.
They told the people in France.
I don't 
Yeah.
know why, just shandy.
So then they would take the shandy out of the machine cos we were listening, cos everyone kept drinking all the shandy.
Cans of drink were naff expensive over there out of the machine!
Those stingy cunts.
I don't even bother to speak French.
I couldn't speak French if I tried.
No one could speak French on that French trip not even the teachers.
That's so stupid, innit?
Is it?
Yeah, there was one French teacher who wanted to come, they wouldn't let her come.
They had a Spanish man there  and another teacher, none of them spoke French.
Nobody spoke, Mr  spoke a little bit of French but he spoke Spanish fluently.
I mean I knew just as much as him.
Bonjour, Au revoir!
Yeah, but hold on a minute, hold on a minute, how do you 
I don't know, know, the man who owned the hotel we were staying in knew English.
We didn't get food anyway we just eat French bread all week!
They made some shitty food!
Their cheese stunk like  You know how sweaty socks stink?
Real bad sweaty socks.
The cheese stunk like that.
How can you eat food that stinks?
And they had all this  on top of it and everything, so everyone just eat bread.
Just bread!
That's all we got, bread and water.
No they eat  
We got bread, no we got bread and then the only time we got chips was in the middle of the week.
You should've seen people yamming down their chips.
I've never seen people eat chips, cos you know how you get sick of chips sometimes, we's shovelling down the chips down and coke, proper coke they were drinking.
Isle of Wight  Isle of Wight, ferry, yeah, and we, we all buy, we all buy chips yeah, and the next minute, you know, we're all walking into the arcade all these girls just come up to us and start taking chips.
what you doing?
And they go, can we have a chip please?
Cos they, they say that they always  chips.
and in the middle of the night they took me out my bed and left me 
I had to try and find my way back to the camp.
Yeah!
It was Rodney and Delroy.
They took me out, took me out of the bed and just dropped me!
And in the morning, yeah, you have to wake up earlier  they'd bring the hosepipe and they'd wake you up with cold water and you'd have to have a cold shower and everything  And sometimes they, they put, they'd used  I got, I got done the worse  and, like, I just woke up cos I felt cold.
And I woke up and I found myself that I was the only one.
I'd have been shitting myself!
Shit to lick!
I was scared!
We, we had to walk back and then  and then before  and then 
when we got out there, try and find our way back.
But if you get captured by any of the class you get  you have to back away, man.
You lot waste out all my tape, that's good.
but we're having votes to see if we should let girls in but we shouldn't.
There's only, it's true, it's true!
Where, where,wh Boys' Club?

And she's  that only Nadine alone.
So I goes Mr  why don't you just let girls into the club as well?
And he goes, oh yeah, we'll have to have for that.
But I know see enough boys are gonna say let girls in, of course, but  and he's a fool!
When we went camping, the girls aren't so depressing.
The girls and the boys all camping together.
Some girl's going out with a boy, he zipped her tent up over them and she was so shocked she pulled her trousers down by accident.
She had nothing on underneath.

Here you are, Jane!
What was that Stephen?
Nothing.
Good.
Nothing joking.
Good.
Informer 
Good.
What did he say?
He never knew I was an informer.
Miss!
Miss.
you've cracked it again now.
Don't 
Eh?
it breaks
It breaks?
Yeah.
Well, as far as I'm concerned  Nick's a cunt.
As simple as that.
he  he's  he, he's a  he's a user and he can't take it when he's dumped and he can't take being told the truth, like he's an idiot.
And he likes to talk about you.
My mate's Gary, my mate Gary's erm friend called Nick yeah?
Alright, he's going out with a girl called Laura, he's coming onto her sister but he thinks he's in love with Sally.
Hang on, is that three girls?
Yeah.
Oh fuck!tricky 
It's so stupid!
really love Sally.
And you know the thing, no wait a minute, the thing that gets me is you know when James fancied me?
Right, now it was obvious James fancied me.
Now all I wanted was for James to ask me out and I would've when out with him you know.
But Nick got in there first.
But what pissed me off was, right,
He used you to get James.
No, no, no, no, nothing like that.
What pissed me off is, is he's hanging about with James and that lot now right, but when you talk about James and that lot to him its, oh they're a bunch of chiefs.
Is it 
Don't, no don't say anything because he comes back to me, it comes back onto me.
It don't matter whether you say I won't say anything cos it always comes back.
But he thinks Cathy and that lot are going to  he thinks Cathy's a slag and everything, yet he's still hanging about with all you lot.
He's a slag.
And I'm just going to put this in the bin.
He's gay.
I really, no he really pisses me off 
wanker.
and  he's just using James and that lot.
Cos I never say, I mean I don't,
Cos he hasn't got any friends of his own.
I don't me I mean I like James and that lot.
I think all of that lot are alright.
Peter's, but if I think Peter's a bit of a tosser I tell Peter to his face, he's a tosser.
Did you see what Peter did round there right?
You know Nick being really cool?
He had some Hoola Hoops and he crunched them all up and then he went  
blurgh! spat them all out.
He spat them all out and then Peter goes  oh Peter!
Urgh!
On, off the floor?
Off the floor.
And Nick had chewed it all up?
Nick had spat it out like he'd thrown it up or something.
Horrible!
Urgh!
Peter's nasty, man.
Oh God you haven't, have you heard about the fifth year toilet yet?
No what happened.
Someone shitted on the floor.
Someone crapped on the floor!
By the loo, I had to go in there 
she must've been holding it in because she didn't wanna wipe her bum with her hand and then you know it just burst out before she could get to the toilet.
Well I did go cos I was investigating yeah.
And you know it had little blobs, alright, leading up to the big long shit!
It was as if they were really desperate and they knickers round their ankles running into the toilet!
That must be really embarrassing.
Mind you I suppose it's better on the floor than in your knickers  
I mean I remember when I went, first went to my cheap caravan site where there isn't a toilet and you have to walk to the toilets, and I remember a couple of times when I was little, shitting my pants on the way to the toilets, you know, cos I couldn't hold it in.
But  when you reach this age you should be able to control it!
My first year at Grange Hill, right, you know when I used to wear boxer shorts with no knickers on underneath?
Dirty Cath!
I was, I, I had diarrhoea this time, yeah, and I was 
Oh my God!
I was busting,
Oh, you didn't shit your pants, did you?
I was busting and I was there going  I said  and I couldn't exactly say  can I go to the toilet?
So I did one and then this, by this time I was desperate.
Look, I've got to go to the toilet!
Alright then.
I went running and I went running and I  the relief of sitting down on that toilet and going   you know you know when your completely busting and then it's the relief  
It's like when you piss and it's really bad, it's really bad and then you get to the toilet and it's  that's why I like that bit in, have you seen A League of Their Own?
Where he comes in and he does that piss and he's  and Madonna's standing there looking at him like this  and she's just looking at him and she's going, anyone who can keep it up that long  and he's just sitting there going er no he's going er and she's going, she's going, and she's coming round like that trying to look at him, I couldn't stop laughing.
And the piss was going on for ages.
Janice goes, it wasn't good.
A League of Their Own.
Oh I thought that was quite good!
She said it wasn't as good as good as they thought it was gonna be, everyone told me it was brilliant.
I said, I don't care what people think I, I think it's brilliant.
No, I think it was brilliant.
I thought it would've been a bit better but I did enjoy it, I did enjoy it.
It was a good film.
Yeah, I mean there were bits 
It's the sort of film you can sit and watch a few times.
Well I know I can.
You know what I mean i , that's what I mean, it was, it wasn't predictable, do you know what I mean?
And it was, I mean, right, things like House Party and all that lot  white man  Malcolm X, they're all black films.
If the truth be known.
And that's why I like Candyman.
Shelley said that was crap.
Grace thought it was brilliant.
Why?
Because the man's a black man.
The thriller man in it is a black man.
It's not that they're being racist 
It was just a shitty film.
I mean, I, I agree with them there's hardly any leading roles for black people but
I mean the problem is that
Eddie Murphy films are good though 
And Whoopie Goldberg and they're brilliant actor 
She, she's done some brilliant anti-racist films 
yeah they.
But the thing is even people that, even though people are saying, well you've gotta get more black people into it, but if  
You know, there's, there's a law in America.
But that's, but that's what I mean, they're making, they're saying let's make, when the white people make films black and white people watch them, they're not specifically  made for white people, not specifically  made for black people, it just happens to be white actors.
But when they make a black film, they make a black film for black people to sit and watch.
I've got it all on this tape Malcolm X, Kerry's saying Malcolm X is brilliant, he was a black man, he was a nigger and Truno was going shut up Truno's black too and she was going shut up!
Malcolm X, stupid black nigger, do you know what I mean.
But because they're black it don't make no difference, do you know what I mean.
Cos if we say it 
We say it 
But if I was to say it, it's different.
Like, Kerry goes to me, cos I've got a black kitten he goes, what are you gonna call it?
I goes dunno.
Goes call it Malcolm X.
I goes shut up!
He goes, call it, call it Ma call it Martin X and then he says call it Nigger.
I think Nigger's a good name but, you know what I mean like, come here Nigger!
But  it's, it's racist.
If I'd a, if I were walking down the street going  Nigger!sorry!
Last year, right, I was on holiday in the South of France and I, I'd made friends with these two German people and I'm a bit wary of German people anyway, cos of what's happened and everything.
Mm.
And, no, they hadn't done anything racist up until then and I goes casually, do you like Bob Marley?
No, he's a black nigger.
What!
Do you know what you're saying you are, you are some stupid  
He's a legend, man.
fool.
You know?
I'm going  and, and I said, look, he's a decent bloke.
He goes,yes, he's a nice man, but black.
I went well observed! you know I would never have known 
Bob Marley was brilliant.
But the thing is, you know all that erm early stuff that Bob Marley did, they're bringing it out, it's not that good.
Yeah, they shouldn't, they shouldn't cos his music was made for that time.
That was, the music was made for his, that time, you know what I mean, it's not for this time.
I know, but I mean  But some of the stuff is brilliant.
But I hate people  I , I hate people that are, I hate people that are biased, like the new Madonna book.
That book's disgusting!
It's a disgusting book, she shouldn't have made it.
Have you seen it yet?
I wanna see it.
Do you know, I hate people that do that.
They're saying it's disgusting but they wanna see it.
Body of Evidence.
Body of Evidence is disgusting film.
I wanna watch it.
You know what I mean.
I'll tell you what's a good film, and I don't care what anyone says, but I really love Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.
Yes, that was brilliant!
I do like that film but you've 
Whose seen,
seen it so many times  
who's seen, who's seen Basic Instinct?
I haven't.
My mum's seen it.
That's a really dirty film, innit?
I didn't think  
It is so crap I don't know what it is.
It is a sexist  stupid perverted film, I watched it round Nick's house.
Oh god.
Oh well that explains it 
No, no listen to this, listen to this, right.
There's no nudity of men  right, it's all nudity of women, like when Sharon Stone sits there with her legs her open and she ain't go no knickers on.
It's all nudity of women.
There ain't one decent man in it, only Michael Douglas.
He's not exactly
He was nicer when he was young but kind of now, he's kind of old, do you know what I mean.
Exactly.
There's no decent men in it and there's no nudity of men it, even when he's in it all you got to see of him was waist-high, you got to see a clips of his bum.
It was such a se it was, it's, the only bit that was worth be seeing was the beginning bit when she's fucking a man she sticks an axe through him.
A pick, an ice pick through him.
How's your eye, Aiden?
Did Nick say when he was  
Don't bother watching .
In fact I'd wait four days, I'd wait four years to watch it on T V it's so crap.
Janice thinks it's brilliant.
Yeah, but she's sort of really naive and really
Gets on my nerves sometimes.
I'm not being funny, but she's a white man's woman, don't you think so?
Yeah.
She, she's all
Very dependent.
Yeah.
Very
Ooh Alan, ooh Alan.
She, she's everything men want women to be, you know.
She's pathetic.
  
Like it really, that film really pisses me off right, when he's beating her up and he rips her knickers off and fucks her up the arse and Nick's going that's how to treat a wo it's disgusting  fucking a woman up her arse, and ripping off the woman's knickers and rip putting it up  sitting watching it thinking 
There's that film Nine and a half weeks, I haven't seen that I suppose  as well.
He ties her up, rubs ice blocks all over her.
Lovely 
The difference is with Body of Evidence is it's Madonna whose in, it's a woman whose in control.
It's a woman whose using a man.
It's a woman that's taking advantage of men, that's good.
That's why I wanna see it.
It is  
Body of Evidence?
It's, it's a woman!
it's still like, it's still like the opposite of Basic Instinct  
Yeah, it's the opposite of Basic Instinct.
It's like, with  Sharon Stone, even at the end she was still dependent on Michael Douglas, like, when he was going she was crying and she couldn't kill him at the end cos she loved him so much and, you know what I mean, so no, Body of Evidence, it'll probably have a rubbish end and she'll probably marry the lawyer or something, but it was still good to see her beat, tying a man up, putting candle wax on him and shit.
Oh my god!
anyone seen that?
Oh, it was brilliant!
He's so cute!
I think I've fallen in love with Rick Mayall now.
Did you like the end when they, she had to leave him?
I love, I love Tony Slattery.
You know, you know what bit made me laugh?
You know the bit when they're out in the garden and he goes, he goes, why are you back?
She goes, cos I'm, I'm erm, she goes, erm, cos, no, cos you're not happy.
And he goes, well get happy!
And he gets the spade and hits her on the head with it and he goes, I never want to talk to you again and he kicks her in the head.
I couldn't stop laughing.
I thought it was funny  
 
bannister he went like this and went
Yeah, he went oh!
He goes, who put that there?
And the bit where he goes 
He goes urgh, cobwebs and she goes piss off!
She goes Mum, come and sit here, she goes, piss off! like that and the mother goes you talking to me?
And she goes   And the little girl!
I liked it when he went  smelly smelly smelly dog poo  
Dog pooh! wipe it on the sides a doo di doo di doo  I loved the way he done that!
And you know the bit where erm she's in bed and the hand comes out from behind the pillow and it goes  over the back of her head and she goes, she goes, she was so cute she goes, she goes, what a pile of shit!and when, you know when she cleans up all the cornflakes?
Yeah.
She's sitting there, she's putting it all in and she goes, she goes  and she goes  and she goes, yeah
And when her mum stands there  back of her hair trying to  
Yeah, and she stands, she's going, she's going, on the way I caught cornflakes disease aargh!
Not even a 
I know, he goes, I don't love you, you know.
He goes I'm an alien, I'm going into space but on the way I caught cornflakes disease aargh!
it's like why do you call him  honey?
She goes  cos that's his name, Daddy   
You know when that comes on telly again?

Have you got one of them videos that you can tape tape tapes then?
No, no, no.
It's a satellite.
No, it's on Sky.
Is it?
It's been on Sky.
I like that, I, I think it's really sweet when she's taking those tablets and he's sitting there  
Yeah, and he's going, oh, he's going, he's going, he's going, snotface!
I love the way cos he goes I got something for you  and with the ink he goes, oh, alright, and he throws it and  and he goes, nice catch!
You can tell it's not a dog's food it's like cake mix  
Yeah.
You know another bit that was really good?
The bit where, where she goes, are you gonna do it like the pigeons?
He goes, no, you're not supposed to do it like that you're supposed to get her on the floor and step on her head! you're not doing it right!
I think he's really gorgeous.
The one, the one, when he's got, when he's got  
I've fallen in love yeah
you know, you know the way he goes like this with it, he goes 
Yeah.
And the bit where she's, the mum's cleaning it up and she's got the gas


That was wicked.
And when she, when she goes  when she goes, is he in that chair?
And he goes  she's ke she's beating him up under the chair she goes
Yeah cos he's
the only time  's wife is out of town.
All the people they're going
And she goes  excuse me  and she goes back in.
She was really good in that.
She was in Star Wars 
I like the bit when he goes, yeah, when he goes  pirates!
And he, and she's going, oh!and she goes, what did you do, Fred?
And he goes, I didn't do anything  And he goes, he goes, she goes, right, you be the captain I'll do everything else, don't touch nothing.
He goes, alright then.
What, not even that?
And he pushes it and runs out.
I think it's so funny.
I've seen it three times now.

It'd be just my luck I'll just touch it and it'd go off.
I remember when I was in , when I was in  right?
We was carrying this ta erm table up the stairs and some boy  knocked it and it  fire alarms, everyone was, water started pouring down cos they have all the water as well, like, if it is a fire  it was pouring

We didn't get to do anything good this year.
It's all been boring.
No, I mean all the fourth years last year you was allowed to out and go ice skating and things like that and this year we didn't get nothing.
I no it's no we ain't got the money for it.
Basically it's out of my hands now.
I asked  no way  could I take two years out again and that was it.
Why?
well it's because, no, no, no, no 
Is it because of our year or is it to do with money.
no, it's to do with money.
Please do it Maggie because it's 
we have to miss out.
To take  to take the years out it costs around about eight thousand  terms.
But most people pa like 
And they weren't 
pay money to go anyway.
Yeah, but they're not, the whole idea is that they're not, they don't wanna ask, they're not prepared to ask it's not right  It should be provided by the school  they've been against that whole thing.
So they won't  do that, and of course it's  and the main thing that costs is the transport  is every time you go on a bus you're down to whatever it is  two hundred pounds, and because of the two areas that we use, I mean we're not gonna, I mean I don't really know  
School should have a bus of its own?
Yeah.
But it's not, it's not actually  it's happened elsewhere.
I mean some schools have not gone off site at all you know they've actually stayed inside  
Neither have we!
They haven't gone anywhere.
Neither have we.
No, what I'm saying is  some schools have lost it in year eleven as well.
And I'm still waiting to hear  whether or not 
We won't get it in year eleven?
Well, I can't promise you that because that again  like this year, I mean 
If we're not gonna get next year  losing more and more money.
have you noticed that?
Well it's that's just nothing to do with the year 
It's all right for the first years now cos they're never even gonna know about it.
When they get here
Yeah, I know.
It is hardest for your year  because you've known other people to have  erm 
Miss, can we go downstairs?
Well I'm just 
Cos he started writing to her.
She started writing to him and  she didn't wanna, she don't like him, she hates him, but I was saying like yeah go on!
You know, trying to get her into shit.
I was saying  say you like him, say you like him.
She was going no! and I was writing yes! and giving it to him.

Osmond, please, I really want my tape back.
I've forgot which one it was.
It was a Madonna one  and it had a bit of other stuff on it on the other side.
Like what?
It's a see-through one with blue stickers on it, innit?
Yeah, a see-through one with blue stickers, it's got erm  on it  It's got Whitney Houston on it.
It's go My Girl on it  It's got Maria, what's her name?
Mariah Carey.
Mariah Carey on it  It's got Madness on it.
It's got loads of stuff and it's got Madonna on it.
I let him borrow it.
Everyone said don't lend it to him, listen, they goes don't lend it to him, don't, you won't get it back  he'll give it back.
Try and find it for me, it was a ninety-minute one.
And it's got Madonna and all sorts written on it.
Don't call me that all right?
What, oral sex?
I wouldn't mind provided I had flavoured condoms  
I don't think there's nothing the matter with oral sex as long as,
 
as long as he's got a clean penis!
It's, it's safer!
It's safer sex, you know.
No, I don't think there's anything the matter with oral sex.
Would you ever toss someone off .
Toss your boyfriend off?
What's that?
Wanking for him.
I've already done that   
To Nick's nose.
Yeah  To Nick's nose!
I've never handled Nick.
I hear you've fallen out.
He ain't talking to me and I ain't talking to him.
Simple as that.
Why?
May I ask?
Look, he can't take it because I dumped him.
All right, I'm, I'm never speaking to you again because ever since you dumped him  he's been hanging around with us and he's pissing me off!
He's so annoying, int he?
He is.
He thinks he's it.
Innit?
If you touch him, it's   do you mind?
Do you mind?
No, but he has gone going round  
Right, and he's so, have you noticed he is, he is so violent, int he?
I mean 
No.
I'll tell you what I hate about him, right.
