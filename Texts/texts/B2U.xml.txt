SHOPS AND SHOPPING
Introduction
Next time you go shopping in a large town or city shopping centre, look around at all the different types of shops.
You'll probably see large department stores, ‘chain’ stores, supermarkets, small boutiques…
On your way shopping you may have passed local ‘corner shops’, a large superstore, perhaps a street market…
This section looks at the many different forms of retailing, and how different sorts of shops and stores operate.
The retailer and service
Who or what is a retailer?
These pictures should give you a clue.
The retailer supplies a product, or a service (eg dry cleaning) to the consumer — the customer.
Although they all share the same aim, retail outlets vary considerably.
Size, type of shop and location range from the small local ‘corner shop’ to the giant, out-of-town hypermarket, from department stores to mail-order firms.
Another way in which retail outlets vary is in the type of service they offer to customers.
Here are some examples.
Personal service
In some shops the sales assistant stands behind the counter waiting to ask you what you would like.
She may then give you information about the range of goods on sale, and show you particular products.
The sales assistant serves you personally — she selects the goods you ask for, takes your money, gives you your change, wraps up your purchase and may even pack the goods into your shopping bag.
Self-selection
Woolworth stores operate a self-selection service system.
Customers pick up a basket and walk around the store, selecting the goods they require.
Then they take the basket to one of the checkout points and pay for the goods there.
This is similar to the system used in supermarkets, except that in self-selection stores there are usually a number of ‘service points’ and several different exits.
A supermarket usually has only one exit.
Other examples of self-selection stores are British Home Stores, and Marks and Spencer.
Self-service.
Self-service stores are very popular.
They range in size from the small corner shop (like the one on Coronation Street ) to huge hypermarkets like Asda and Tesco.
Entrance and exit point are usually separate.
Customers collect a basket or trolley at the entrance and then walk up and down the aisles selecting goods.
When the customer arrives at the checkout point he unloads the goods from the trolley on to the conveyer belt.
The checkout operator cashes up the goods, the customer pays and then leaves via the specific exit.

Retail outlets
As we saw in the last section, all shops offer a service to the customer, although the type of service may vary.
Now let's look at the different types of retail outlet.
These fall into two main categories:
1 Shops
A shop is usually a small building where the retailer sells goods.
Shops often specialise in one type of goods — eg sports equipment, shoes.
2 Stores
A store is a much larger establishment.
Articles of various kinds are sold — often in different departments.
Within these very broad categories fall many different types of organisation.
Shops
The sole trader
A sole trader is a person who starts a business on his own.
That person is then solely responsible for any debts the business may incur.
Being a sole trader can be a risky venture, but it has advantages as well as disadvantages:
Advantages
1
The retailer can build personal relationships with his customers
2
Premises are often located near people's homes and workplaces — customers just ‘pop in’, rather than having to make a special journey
3
The retailer can stock a wide range of goods, to cater for the needs of different customers
4
The shop can be kept open outside normal opening hours, to meet the needs of the community
5
Overheads (rent, rates etc) are usually lower than they would be in a town centre, where sites are expensive
6
Members of the family may help in the shop (without wages)
7
The trader can offer customers credit — or not
8
The trader can easily provide a delivery service (most customers will live close by)
9
The trader may be part of a voluntary group like Spar or VG, which enables him to buy in bulk
Disadvantages
1
Sole traders have to compete with retail multiples (see below) who buy in bulk and can therefore afford to offer lower prices
2
Most sole traders have little time to spend on displays or promoting goods effectively
3
The trader may not have expertise in accounting or buying
4
The trader may not have the money to expand the business
5
The out-of-town site may lack the advantages of a large shopping centre 
6
Many people now use their cars to go shopping, and buy a whole week's supplies — this has taken trade away from the small local shop
The independent trader
An independent trader is an organisation of up to ten shops.
Usually, the independent trader is a single shop, which may be owned by a sole trader, a partnership or a family.
Most independent traders have premises outside the main town/shopping centre — eg in the local High Street or on a large housing estate.
A partnership
When two or more people set up a business together, they form a partnership.
Like the sole trader, the partners are personally responsible for paying off any debts the shop may incur.
If the business gets into financial difficulties, there may be problems between the partners.
Legally, if only one of the partners has the money to pay off the company's debts, then she must do so.
That partner then has to pursue the others to get them to pay their share.
Partnership agreements should always be drawn up by a solicitor, so that the rights and responsibilities of each partner are clear.
A sleeping partner is a person who contributes capital (money) to a business, and receives a share of the profits, but takes no active part in running the business.
Limited companies
There are two types of limited company:
A private limited company
The company can have between two and 50 shareholders (people who have given money to help set up the company, and in return take a share of its profits).
The shareholders cannot sell or transfer their shares to anyone else, and the company's accounts have to be examined by the Registrar of Companies each year.
Private limited companies are often family businesses.
A public limited company (plc)
A public limited company must have a minimum of seven shareholders, but there is no upper limit.
Shares in the company can be bought on the stock market by members of the public.
The company itself is run by a board of directors elected by the shareholders.
Like private limited companies, plcs have to send their accounts to the Registrar of Companies each year.
Multiples
Multiples are organisations with ten or more shops controlled from a central office.
Most multiples deal in only one commodity — eg shoes, clothes or wine.
The shops are usually situated in High Streets or shopping precincts.
A central buying office purchases the goods and all the shops draw their stock from this central store.
Each branch manager is responsible for selling the goods in his particular shop, and reports to a district supervisor.
The layout of shops is often standardised, to create an easily identified image.
For example, Laura Ashley or Next shops will look similar throughout the country, and will stock the same range of goods.
Variety chains
Like multiples, variety chains consist of more than ten stores, usually situated in High Streets or shopping precincts, with buying organised by a central office.
The main difference between variety chains and multiples is in the goods they stock.
Variety chains offer a wider range of products.
They often have their own brand name — for example,St Michael is the brand name of Marks and Spencer.
Shops in most variety chains have standardised layouts and operate self-selection service.
Multiples and variety chains have the following advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages
1
They can reach a large number of people
2
Centralised buying enables them to keep costs down
3
They can concentrate on fast-moving products (ie goods that sell well), so that stock is not held for too long and money is released to buy more goods
4
They can advertise nationally, increasing sales
5
They can keep prices fairly low
6
They are easily identified (by frontages, logo and store design)— this helps attract customers
Disadvantages
1
There is little personal contact with customers
2
Some mass-produced goods may not sell well in regions which have their own styles or tastes
3
Some customers prefer goods which are not mass-produced and seek a wider range of products
4
If a product fails to sell well, the company may be left with a lot of unwanted stock which it has to sell at a reduced price
Stores
Department stores
Department stores have a variety of different departments under one roof and usually sell at least four different types of goods.
They vary in size, and are usually located in city centres or shopping precincts.
Department stores operate personal service, and may offer a variety of other customer services, including credit facilities, delivery services, lifts and/or escalators and restaurants.
There is only a small amount of centralised buying; each department is responsible for its own buying and stock control.
Some department stores include concessionaires or ‘shops within shops’(see page 60).
Department stores have the following advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages
1
Personal service enables staff to build up relationships with customers
2
Central locations mean plenty of potential customers
3
Many customers like being free to move around the store
4
Concessions to manufacturers or other retailers (eg Wedgwood pottery, The National Trust, Berkertex clothing) bring added income and may attract more customers
5
Extra services (eg watch repair, engraving) may bring in additional customers
Disadvantages
1
Since each department is responsible for its own buying it is difficult for the store to buy in bulk, and thus cheaply
2
Prices are often high — customers may ‘shop around’ and find similar goods priced more cheaply elsewhere
3
Personal service means that greater numbers of staff must be employed and wage costs are higher
4
Delivery services are expensive
Supermarkets
Supermarkets are usually self-service, with a single exit point and at least three checkout points.
They are usually found in town centres and shopping precincts.
The size of the shop floor in a supermarket is usually about 600 square metres (slightly larger than a tennis court).
Most supermarkets sell a wide range of products — often with special offers and price reductions.
The majority sell food and household goods, but DIY supermarkets are becoming more popular.
The advantages and disadvantages of supermarkets include:
Advantages
1
Locations are usually handy for customers who are using other central services (eg banks, public library), who work in the city centre, or who rely on public transport
2
Prices are low (because of bulk buying, wide ranges, special offers etc), which attracts customers
3
They usually sell small sizes as well as family sizes, which attracts customers who cannot/do not need to buy in bulk
4
They use low-cost fittings and displays
Disadvantages
1
Profit margins are low (see page 145)
2
They tend to concentrate on manufacturers' most popular brands
3
They do not provide a delivery service
Superstores are larger than supermarkets, but not as big as hypermarkets (see below).
They sell a variety of goods on a self-service basis.
Superstores are usually located in town centres and shopping precincts.
Hypermarkets
A hypermarket is basically a giant supermarket!
Minimum floor space is about 15 000 square metres (about the size of a small football pitch) and the store may have as many as 40–50 checkout points.
These large retail outlets stock a wide range of goods — from food and household products to clothes and even electrical goods.
Hypermarkets are usually situated on the outskirts of towns and cities.
Most customers come by car, and do their shopping on a weekly or even monthly basis, so hypermarkets have large car parks.
Some also offer a free bus service, to encourage customers who do not have their own transport.
Hypermarkets have a large catchment area (ie customers may come from the town itself, and neighbouring towns and villages over quite a wide region).
Hypermarkets offer a number of advantages to the customer, but there are also some disadvantages:
Advantages
1
They offer self-service
2
Prices are competitive (either the same as in other retail outlets, or slightly lower)
3
They have large, free car parks, and often sell cut-price petrol on an adjacent site
4
Customers can purchase a wide range of goods under one roof — an advantage for families, in particular 
5
The layout of the store, with wide aisles, gives customers room to move around
6
They stay open late for at least part of the week, so that customers can shop after work
Disadvantages
1
Large numbers of people deter some customers (eg the elderly or frail)
2
People without a car cannot reach them (unless there is a special bus service, and this may not be convenient)
3
Shopping for one can be difficult — pre-packed goods are usually sold in larger sizes
4
There is no delivery service
5
In some cases the cost of petrol may add to the food bill
Discount stores
Discount stores are usually large, warehouse-type buildings, often sited outside towns, or on trading estates.
They sell a range of related products (eg Comet stores sell electrical appliances).
Goods are bought in bulk; and prices are often lower than they would be in a department store or High Street shop.
Discount stores are often self-service, and most offer a delivery service for larger items, although sometimes a charge is made for this.
Discount stores have the following advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages
1
Very low prices (the retailer makes savings through bulk buying, and overheads are lower than in a central location — part of these savings is passed on to the customer)
2
They stock manufacturers' popular brands — national advertising campaigns sometimes benefit both retailer and customer
3
They may offer a delivery service
Disadvantages
1
Profit margins are low
2
Self-service means that it may be difficult for customers to get information about a product
3
Goods are not attractively displayed — they are often left in cartons, as the supplier delivered them
4
Out-of-town location can deter people who don't have their own transport
Co-operatives
The co-operative ideal dates back to 1844 when a group of Lancashire businessmen — the ‘Rochdale pioneers’— decided to work together, or ‘co-operate’.
There are now many co-operatives in Britain.
They range from small, independent organisations with only one or two branches, to large societies with a membership over 100 000.
The system works in the following way:
a)
The members of the society are all shareholders.
They contribute money by buying shares at £1 each.
In return they receive interest on their shares, and a dividend on their purchases in the form of trading stamps.
b)
Members are entitled to a say in the way their society is run.
They can attend meetings and elect the management committee (on a one person, one vote system).
CO-OP shops take many forms — from the small corner shop to the department store or hypermarket.
The majority of CO-OPs are food stores, but some sell clothes, furniture and household items.
A number of regional distribution centres store and send out goods.
Other services provided by Co-operative societies include undertakers, coal merchants and opticians.

Other ways of buying and selling
Not all retail outlets are shops — and not all shops are as straightforward as the ones described in the last section.
Here are some other ways of buying and selling .
Mobile shops
Mobile shops are literally ‘shops on wheels’— vans converted to carry a range of goods, from fruit and vegetables to hardware.
Mobile shops are invaluable for people who live in rural areas, in the suburbs of large towns, or in isolated housing estates.
The advantages and disadvantages of mobile shops include:
Advantages
1
They stay open (or visit) late
2
The customer doesn't have to carry goods far — the van stops near houses
3
Prices are reasonable
4
The trader gives personal service and has direct contact with customers
Disadvantages
1
Overheads are high — the van has to be maintained
2
Business is lost if the van breaks down
Market traders
Markets vary a great deal in size and style, but they are very popular with the buying public.
Traditionally, markets are held in the open air, often on a certain day, or days, of the week, but in many towns the market has become a more permanent set-up, incorporated into a modern shopping precinct.
Even here, however, the market retains its ‘open air’ image, and is separate from the retail outlets that surround it.
Markets contain stalls selling a wide variety of goods, from fruit and vegetables to clothes, shoes and make-up.
The market traders rent stalls from the market manager, and usually occupy the same stalls on the same days.
Individuals may sometimes rent a stall on a ‘one-off’ basis, usually by waiting until a particular time (eg 11.00) to see if the regular trader turns up.
Most market managers require to know what a trader is going to sell.
The advantages and disadvantages of market trading include:
Advantages
1
Low overheads (rent of stall)
2
No fittings or fixtures to replace or property to repair
3
Central location, with plenty of potential customers
4
The trader gives personal service and has direct contact with the customer 
5
Competitors are close-at-hand (this means the trader can adjust his prices, if necessary — eg if a neighbouring stall is selling tomatoes at 30p a pound, the trader can reduce his tomatoes to the same price or lower)
Disadvantages
1
Goods may be damaged by the weather
2
Bad weather affects opening hours and may keep customers away, resulting m lost sales
3
There is little or no heating for staff
4
There is limited space for goods
Franchises
Franchises look and operate like ordinary shops, as far as the customer is concerned.
In fact, we are all familiar with franchises, although we may not realise it.
Examples include Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pronuptia bridal wear and Dyno Rod drain clearance.
If a large organisation, small company or individual develops a product, or adopts a trade name, they usually own the copyright on that item or name.
However, they may give another business a licence, or franchise, to sell that product or use the name, in return for a percentage of the takings (a royalty).
So, for example, if you start a garage, you will take the name of the petrol company whose petrol you sell.
The retailer setting up a franchise outlet must pay for his own premises, stock, overheads etc; he owns the entire business, but has the advantage of selling a product that is widely-known.
The company receives a royalty, which consists of a small percentage of turnover, and in return the retailer gains free national advertising, plus the support and guidance of the big company if he runs into difficulties.
Door-to-door sales people
Door-to-door sales people sell goods direct to the public.
Door-to-door sales methods are used for a variety of products, from vacuum cleaners and household goods to cosmetics or double glazing.
Most door-to-door sales people carry a few sample items and an illustrated catalogue showing their complete range of goods.
The customer selects items from the catalogue and the salesperson takes the order.
The goods are delivered later.
Party-plan selling
Party-plan selling operates from the salesperson's own home.
An individual becomes an agent for a company manufacturing, for example, cosmetics.
In order to sell the merchandise, he or she invites friends and neighbours to a party.
The agent usually starts off the party with a few games, to help people get to know each other.
He or she often provides refreshments, too.
The aim is to create a relaxed, friendly atmosphere which will encourage people to buy.
The agent will give a demonstration of the goods on sale, and visitors can examine them and try them out.
Goods sold at parties range from household items (saucepans, Tupperware) to clothes, jewellery and cosmetics.
In return for holding the party, the agent gets a fee or commission (a percentage of the price) on goods sold.
The host or hostess also gets a commission if one of the guests decides to hold a similar party, and become an agent for the company.
Vending machines
Vending machines usually sell items such as hot or cold drinks chocolate and cigarettes.
They are usually placed in factories and offices, or in public places such as railway stations.
The owner of the premises usually owns or rents the machine, receives the profits, and is responsible for re-stocking when goods run out.
A different form of vending machine is that providing a service.
For example, the washing machines in your local launderette are actually completely automatic vending machines.
Concessionaire shops
Concessionaire shops are actually ‘shops within shops’.
Large department stores such as Debenhams or House of Fraser allow manufacturers to rent space and set up their own outlets — for goods such as cosmetics, clothes, sportswear etc.
Concessionaires usually employ their own staff, but are able to take advantage of the facilities offered by the department store, together with its advertising, and its larger numbers of customers.
The rent paid by the retailer is much less than the cost of overheads in an equivalent central location.
Mail order
Mail order can operate in several different ways:
1 Catalogue sales
Members of the public act as agents, taking orders for goods from family and friends.
In return, the agent is paid a commission — a percentage of the value of the sales he or she makes.
Customers may pay for goods in instalments.
2 Newspaper or magazine advertisements
Advertisements in newspapers or magazines usually offer only one product, or a small range of goods.
Credit facilities are not normally available as payment is usually made when the goods are ordered.
3 Book and record clubs
Book and record clubs make special offers to members.
Usually customers are encouraged to join by a special introductory offer of very cheap books or records.
In accepting this offer, they agree to buy a certain number of books or records over a specific period of time (eg four books a year).
4 Television mail order
Some television advertising gives an address or telephone number for direct sales of goods.
Payment is made by cheque or credit card.
Mail order selling has advantages both for the customer and the retailer.
The customer
can examine/try on items at home (particularly helpful for disabled or housebound customers)
may receive interest-free credit The mail-order firm
has low overheads
can buy in bulk
can store goods in a central warehouse
has hundreds of thousands of potential customers

Inside the shop
Different types of shops are laid out in different ways — you wouldn't expect an expensive dress shop to be laid out in the same way as a supermarket, for example.
But whatever the type of goods being sold, it's important that the retailer plans exactly how the shop is going to be laid out.
Layout and design can make a great difference in increasing sales.
When a retailer sets up a new business, one of the first things he has to do is draw up a plan of the shop floor.
This will be drawn to scale, and show exactly how much space is available.
Next, the retailer will draw in the ‘fixtures and fittings’— shelves, display units, counters and so on.
In a supermarket, for example, there will be one or more checkout points (probably near the doors), various shelf units/freezers, and perhaps one or more counters for cheese, meats and so on .
Customer flow
In deciding where to put his units and counters, the retailer needs to consider the ‘flow’ of people through his shop — from the entry to the checkout point and exit.
It's a bit like crowd control at a football match — the retailer guides the customers along a path through his shop!
If the retailer plans his customer flow carefully, he can increase sales by tempting people to buy more than they intended.
Look at these two examples of the layout of a small supermarket.
The arrows show the direction of customer flow.
Which of the two supermarkets do you think would be the most successful, and why?
As you can see, in example b) the customers enter at the entrance point, but in order to reach the exit point they have to walk past almost all the goods on offer — and are likely to be tempted to buy more.
In example a) it is much easier for the customer to move directly to the checkout and exit, without making additional purchases.
The idea behind self-service shopping is that goods can ‘sell themselves’, and it is usually very successful.
We all buy goods on impulse sometimes — simply because we saw them on the shelf of the shop.
Next time you go to a supermarket, see if you've collected any extra items in your basket or  trolley by the time you reach the checkout.
How good was the customer flow system in that store?
Organisation
The way goods are arranged in the store can also affect sales.
Retailers are always on the look out for ideas to attract customers and encourage them to buy more.
Here are a few of the most successful techniques:
1
Products the customer buys regularly, such as bread, milk, sugar, eggs, tights…are often placed at the rear of the shop.
This means the customer has to walk right through the store and may well be tempted by other items.
2
The position of goods may be changed every few weeks.
A customer who shops regularly at one retail outlet will get to know where the items she normally buys are displayed.
So, if the retailer moves the tea or coffee every few weeks and replaces it with another product (perhaps one that doesn't sell as well) he can bring it to the customer's attention.
3
Loss leaders (items sold very cheaply) are used to draw customers into the shop.
Both large and small retail outlets sell certain products on ‘special offer’.
This means they have added little or no mark-up (see page 145)— they are selling the item(s) at a loss.
Although the retailer may make no profit on that particular item, general sales will be increased as customers drawn in by the loss leader will then buy other goods.
4
Items such as sweets and toys are often displayed at a low level — so that children will see them and either ask for them or buy them.
5
Shelves near the checkout point often contain sweets, books or magazines.
People often buy on impulse while they are queueing to pay.
6
Related goods are usually displayed near to each other.
For example, gardening equipment will be near greenhouses in a large DIY store.
A customer who has made a major purchase may then realise that he needs other, smaller items.

5
In the shop where you work/a shop you know: a) Select three products and name two other products displayed near to them (eg BLEACH — rubber gloves, washing up liquid) b) For each group, explain why you think these goods are displayed close together c) Try to find out the firm's policy on where goods are displayed and who makes the decision.
6
Study the layout of your local supermarket.
Is it easy for the customer to understand the layout?
If not/ can you think of any ways to improve it?
Before you can begin to plan the layout of your shop, of course, you need to know how big it is.Shop floor space is measured in three different ways:
1
Square measurement (or square footage)
2
Shelf measurement (or shelf footage)
3
Linear measurement (or linear footage)
Square measurement
You're probably familiar with this unit of measurement already.
We often need to calculate square footage, or area, in everyday life — eg how much carpet to buy for a room, the amount of turf needed for a new lawn, the size of a new kitchen…
Or you may have worked out area problems in maths lessons at school.
In the same way, if you want to find out the area of the shop floor you simply multiply the length of the room by its width, eg 
Shelf measurement
If a retailer wants to find out the value of sales for each metre of shelf space in a shop, he needs first to find out what the TOTAL shelf measurement is, by measuring each shelf and adding the lengths together.
So, if a fixture has four shelves, each 2.5m long, the total would be 4 × 2.5m = 10m (10 metres of shelving)
Adding together the totals for each shelf display unit, wall fixture, gondola or free-standing unit will give the total shelf measurement for shop
Linear measurement
Linear measurement is used to calculate shelf space in free-standing units, gondolas, freezers etc.
Knowing the amount of shelf space available helps the retailer to work out how much profit each area of shelving is making — and how much it could make.
For example, in A the longest side of the shelf measures 6m, the shortest sides (from front to back) 2m.
To calculate the linear measurement, add together the length of the shelf plus the length of the two sides.
6m + 2m + 2m = 10m (linear measurement = 10m)
Note that if the unit is attached to a wall you do not include the back length.
In the case of a free-standing unit like B, the back length will be included, eg  3m + 2m + 3m + 2m = 10m (linear measurement = 10 metres)
This form of calculation is very useful to the retailer.
It helps him to work out present and expected sales, and to find out how much profit he has made.
For example:
a unit displaying tins of soup has a total linear measurement of 5 metres.
from it the retailer sells tins of soup to the value of £200 per month
so each linear metre of space sells £200.
5 = £40 worth of soup a month.
The amount of sales per linear metre is called shelf yield.
Thus,
the retailer sells £100 worth of tinned spaghetti per month
the spaghetti takes up 10 metres of shelf space
shelf yield per metre is

Shop locations
As well as the local High Street or the central shopping area, many towns and cities have specially-planned shopping areas.
These are often purpose-built and involve large scale development and planning.
Shopping centres
Shopping centres are purpose-built complexes which include many retail outlets under one roof — often on several floors.
Examples include the Bullring Centre in Birmingham and the Arndale Centre in Manchester.
Many shopping centres include car-parking facilities.
Escalators and lifts help customers move between levels, and there may also be fountains, cafes, sculptures and seating areas — all protected from the weather.
Shopping centres provide many advantages for both retailer and customer.
At the rear of each retail outlet there is usually a delivery bay where goods can be loaded and unloaded, and refuse collected.
Customers can usually collect bulky purchases from this exit.
Shopping precincts
These areas are specifically set apart for retail outlets (both large and small) and are designed to be as convenient and pleasant as possible for both customer and retailers.
They frequently include garden areas, seats and toilets.
Many shopping precincts are also pedestrianised.
They may have been purpose-built for pedestrians, or be ordinary streets where the traffic flow is restricted (usually to emergency services and possibly delivery vans).
Pedestrian precincts enable the customer to shop in safety, and walk from shop to shop to compare prices; they are particularly helpful for parents with small children (possibly in prams or pushchairs) and the disabled.

WORKING IN A SHOP
Introduction
We have looked at some of the types of jobs involved in retailing, and at the different sorts of shops you might work in.
Now here's some practical information about the day-to-day tasks involved in working in a shop.
If you already work in a shop — or have done shop work in the past you may find that some of the procedures described here are done differently where you work.
If so, note down how they differ — and then try to find out why.
Till Procedure
If you get a job as a shop assistant or checkout operator, one of the first things you will learn is till procedure.
There are so many different types of tills and cash registers in use today that it would be impossible to describe them all; they range from the old ‘press button’ type to modern, computerised systems.
If your job involves using a till, you will be given training in how to operate it.
Some basic functions
If you work in a large store or supermarket, you may well have an automatic, computerised till.
The assistant simply keys in a code number, or uses a special ‘light pen’ to ‘read’the bar code on the item — and the till does the rest: displays the cost of the item, and shows the amount of change needed, once the assistant has keyed in the amount given by the customer.
A smaller shop or corner store may have a manually-operated till, in which the assistant ‘rings up’ the amount of each purchase and the till displays the total price.
Some of the function keys on a manual till include:
Numbers — for entering the value of the goods
Large, numbered buttons — coded for different types of item, or different departments
‘x’ sign — to record the cost of several identical items
ST — to display the sub-total of prices you have rung up
T/L — to open the till
Error button and + OR — pressed if you have made an error, the +OR adjusts the cash value figures
C/R — to record any credit given
So, for example, if a customer buys three pencils at 30p each and a rubber at 14p, you should:
press 3 × 30 (or 30, three times)
press 14
press the code key for the appropriate department (stationery)
display the total — £1.04
ask the customer for the money: ‘That will be £1.04, please.’
take the money and press T/L
when the till drawer opens, give the customer her change and her receipt
close the till drawer and thank the customer
Of course, different systems vary.
You may find that your till has different buttons, or that the order in which you press them is different.
Each time you record a sale, the till will record this on the till roll.
It will  also record it on the customer receipt, together with the date, the name of the shop, the value of each item purchased and the total amount paid.
Some till receipts also give a description of the goods.
Always give the customers their receipts — it is proof that they have purchased the goods, and may be needed if they wish to return or exchange an item.
The float
At the beginning of each day's trading you will be given a small amount of money (eg £20) in small change, to put into the till.
This float enables the assistant to give customers change early in the day, before more cash comes in from sales.
The amount of money in the float is recorded on a ‘float slip’, and this amount is deducted when the day's takings are cashed-up — to form the float for the next day.
The till drawer
The till drawer is divided into a number of different compartments.
£20, £10 and £5 notes, cheques, gift vouchers, credit card slips etc are put in the compartments at the back of the drawer.
Coins are arranged at the front, in different denominations.
It's important to keep to this organisation — it will help you give change more quickly, and you are less likely to make mistakes (eg giving a customer 10p instead of 50p).
Giving change
If you always follow the same procedure when giving a customer change, you are less likely to make mistakes.
The company you work for may have its own system; if not, follow this basic routine:
1
Tell the customer the price of the item.
2
Keep the money the customer gives you on the till shelf (DO NOT put the money straight into the till).
3
Count out the change into your own hand.
4
Count the change into the customer's hand, and say how much change you are giving.
5
When the customer is satisfied that the change is correct, put the money he gave you into the till.
6
Thank the customer and give him his receipt.
Dealing with cheques and credit cards
Procedures for dealing with cheques and credit cards will vary from store to store, but in general will be as follows:
1
Make sure the cheque is filled in correctly:
name of your shop
amount in words and figures
correct date
customer's signature
2
If the amount is under £50 , ask for the customer's cheque card and check that the details on it match those on the cheque.
3
Some stores ask customers to write their name and address on the back of the cheque, and or their card number.
The assistant may also be required to initial the cheque and/or the till roll.
4
Ring up the amount, as for a cash purchase, but press the appropriate button to record that it is a cheque transaction.
5
Place the cheque in the appropriate compartment in the till drawer.
If your shop accepts credit cards (eg Access, Visa etc) you will have a special form on which to record details of the transaction together with a machine which imprints the details from the card on to the form.
You should fill in: 1 Date of purchase 2 Your own sales number and initials 3 Description of goods 4 Quantity of goods 5 Cost per item (unit cost) 6 Total cost 7 Authorization code 8 Whether the goods are to be taken away or delivered You should also check the details on the card: 1 The expiry date 2 The signature (make sure that it matches the one on the voucher) 3 The strip on which the customer's name is written (make sure it hasn't been tampered with) When you have filled in the information, the customer signs the form.
You retain two copies, and the customer takes one slip as his receipt.
Changing the till roll
If the till roll runs out you need to replace it.
The procedure is as follows: 1 Unlock the till and open the top or side (depending on the type of till).
2 Take the old till roll out carefully (make sure it is not damaged, thereby losing valuable information).
3 Sign and date the end of the till roll.
4 Place the new roll on the reel/spindle, feed the end through into the receipt-holder section and make sure that it will run smoothly.
5 Sign and date the start of the roll.
6 Close and lock the till 
Cashing up
At the end of a day's trading, the retailer needs to know exactly how much money he has taken.
Each assistant/checkout operator has to cash up the contents of the till.
In large stores and supermarkets, ‘pick-ups’ are made throughout the day, so that the tills do not become overloaded with money — and possibly a security hazard.
This means that the final cashing up will not include all the day's takings.
To cash up, the assistant adds up all the contents of the till (including gift vouchers, cheques etc) and fills out a cashing up slip like the one below.
This gives details of the different denominations of money (£20, £10, £5 notes, £1 coins, silver coins and copper), cheques, credit cards etc.
Any refunds given to customers are also recorded on the slip.
The amount provided in the original cash float is deducted and placed in a separate banker's bag.
When the final total is reached, it is checked against the amount recorded on the till roll — and the two figures should be the same!
If the till does not ‘balance’, then everything has to be checked again.

8
Copy the cashing-up slip on page 76, and fill in details for the following.
(You'll need to jot things down in rough first, before you enter totals on the slip.)
Computers in the shop
If you go to any major department store to buy clothes or shoes, you will find computerised tags on the items.
Microtechnology has arrived in the shop!
Computer tags carry a coded message which the computer at the cash desk can read.
Generally, this coded message contains information about the item: its stock code number, size, colour etc.
The price of the item is not usually included in this coded information.
There may also be printed information on the tag, which the assistant can read.
There are several types of computer tags:
1
Kimball tags contain rows of punched holes (similar to those in paper tape).
2
Bar codes consist of a series of thick and thin lines.
These are read by a laser beam at the cash desk.
3
Magnetic tags use magnetised spots to record coded information.
4
Optical (OCR) characters enable people as well as machines to read the information on the tag.
The computer cannot interpret the information if the tag is dirty or marked.
5
Bar marks consist of a series of marks and blank spaces on a reflective surface.
Computerisation makes stock control easy and accurate.
If the firm's tills are connected to a computer, the record of stock levels is automatically adjusted ever, v time a sale is recorded at the till.
This means that the retailer always has up-to-date information about the levels of goods in stock, the availability of sizes, etc.
Mail order firms also use computers.
When an agent telephones the company with an order, the computer operator is able to tell the agent very quickly whether the goods required are in stock.
If the items are available, the computer then takes the order, processes it through the warehouse, transfers the information to the accounts department and prepares all the despatch documents.

Price marking
If you work in a shop, your job may well include price marking — attaching price labels to items and shelf units.
When goods are delivered to the retailer they are first checked against the delivery note and entered in the stock records.
Before the goods can be sold, the retailer must ensure that the price is clearly marked.
Incorrect pricing, or failure to price at all, can result in lost profits.
When staff hazard a guess as to the price of goods — or ask the customer — they are likely to get it wrong.
Price marking can take place at several stages.
At the manufacturer's
Some manufacturers include the price of goods on the packaging itself.
This provides a useful service for the retailer, since the goods then do not have to be priced at the shop.
However, it can be a disadvantage for the customer if an item is purchased as a gift.
In the warehouse
Some retailers set aside an area in the storeroom or warehouse as a ‘goods received area’ where goods are priced soon after delivery from the supplier.
On the shop floor
Sometimes goods are delivered direct to the shop floor without having been priced.
The assistants price the items as they stack them on the shelves, or when they are already on the shelves.
(Direct deliveries sometimes mean that packing materials are left lying about — these must be cleared away Immediately, because they form a hazard to staff and/or customers.)
On the shelf unit
Goods are sometimes not priced individually.
Instead the price is indicated on the shelf or display bin.
This method of pricing can cause problems for the assistant at the till or checkout point, who may not be familiar with the prices of unmarked goods.
Price tickets
Have you ever bought an item with a large, sticky price ticket which you simply could not remove completely?
Or have you bought someone a present and then spent ages trying to cover up the price printed on the packaging?
If you have, you will realise how important it is to use the right type of price ticket for the type of goods being sold.
Methods of pricing include
1
Swing tickets such as Kimball tags
2
Pin and clip-on tickets
3
Gum tabs (usually stuck on with a price-marking gun)
4
Pressure or heat-adhesive labels
5
Direct marking with a rubber stamp or felt-tip pen.
Assignments
1
For a shop that you know, find out:
a)
who is responsible for deciding on the prices of goods (eg the manufacturers, head office, branch manager, owner).
b)
how information about prices is communicated to staff.
c)
who prices the goods and when/where they are priced.
2
Find out what the law says about changing the price of goods (eg, putting two price tickets of different values on one item).
3
Look at the following situation:
a)
What do you think is wrong with what the assistant is saying?
b)
What problems might this cause for the retailer?
c)
What should the assistant have done?
d)
How can the retailer make sure this doesn't happen again?
4
Next time you go shopping, make a list of five different types of goods and note down the way each was priced.
For each one, state whether you think the method of pricing was good or bad, and explain why, eg
book
sticky label
bad
ripped cover when taken off
5
a)
Design price tickets for the following items: leather jacket; garden fork; expensive perfume
b)
For each, explain why you chose your design.
Look at the label
Whether you're a sales assistant or a customer, it's important to find out as much as possible about the product on sale.
One of the best — and easiest ways to obtain information is to LOOK AT THE LABEL.
Reading the labels helps the sales assistant become better informed about the products on sale — and thus able to advise and help the customer more effectively.
As a customer, reading the label will help you decide whether to buy a product — that is, whether it suits your needs (for example , someone on a diet might not want to buy a product containing a lot of sugar).
The label may also tell you how to use the product –eg how long glue takes to dry), or how to look after it (eg washing instructions).
Recently many people have become more concerned about what goes into the food we eat.
The labels on food products give a lot of information.
They may include:
1
A datemark or sell-by date.
This is compulsory on most foods.
It is based on the food's minimum life-span — beyond the date shown the product will be past its best.
2
A list of ingredients — in descending order of weight.
3
A list of additives — often including both the category name and the chemical name or serial number.
The main types of additives are preservatives, flavourings, colourings, stabilisers and emulsifiers (which help maintain the consistency of the product and keep mixtures mixed), antioxidants (which prevent chemical changes which might make the product rancid) and humectants (which stop food drying out).
4
Instructions for use (eg add boiling water and simmer for 20 minutes) 5 Special storage instructions (eg keep in a cool, dry place)
6
Information to back up any claims made about the product (eg if a label says ‘New for slimmers’ it must explain why by listing how many calories it contains)
7
Net quantity — the total amount of food (excluding the packaging)
8
The name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller
9
The name of the country of origin
It is also illegal for manufacturers to give their product a misleading name, or to claim that it is made of a particular ingredient which in fact makes up a very small proportion of the product.
For example, a manufacturer who advertised ‘beef’ sausages which in fact only contained 5% beef could be prosecuted.
British customers have got used to looking for the date stamp on goods so that they can identify the ‘life’ of a product.
Many products simply have the date printed on the label or on the package itself.
On some products, however, the date information is coded.
For example, plastic drinks bottles are coded in several different ways.
Two of the most common methods are shown below.
The clock code
The year in which the product was made is shown by the number in the middle of the circle.
In this case the number is 7, indicating that the product was made in 1987.
The 12 ‘hours’ on the clock represent the 12 months of the year — a number will be marked off to show in which month the product was made.
In this example, the clock shows the third month — so the product was made in March 1987.
2
Another type of date code is made up of a number and a row of dots, eg 
The number indicates the year in which the goods were made.
In this case the number is 6, so the product was manufactured in 1986.
The numbers represent the month in which the product was produced.
January = 12 dots, February 11 dots, and so on.
So this product was made in September 1986.
Assignments

Calculating price reductions
Shops often advertise goods at ‘Half price’ or ‘50% off’and other cut-price offers.
Everyone who works in retailing needs to be able to calculate fractions and percentages.
Fractions
Think of a whole orange 
A whole orange cut into two equal parts becomes two halves:
A whole orange cut into four equal parts becomes four quarters:
A whole orange cut into three equal parts becomes three thirds:
Percentages
Think of that orange again…
A whole orange = 100% (that is, it's made up of 100 parts) A whole orange cut into two equal parts becomes two lots of 50 parts.So ½ the orange = 50%.
A whole orange cut into four equal parts becomes four lots of 25 parts.
So ¼ the orange = 25 %  
A whole orange cut into three equal parts becomes three lots of 33⅓ parts.
So ⅓ the orange = 33⅓%

LOOKING AFTER THE CUSTOMER
Introduction
You may have heard someone use the term ‘customer relations’.
What does this mean?
It simply refers to all the things the retailer does to look after the customers — the things that make them enjoy visiting that shop or store.
If the retailer builds up a good relationship with his customers they will keep coming back — and maybe tell their friends.
No matter how tired or worried you may feel, it's important to make the effort to be pleasant and friendly to customers — and in most cases you will find that they are pleasant and friendly in return.
What is a customer?
The customer is the most important person in the retail business.
You may think that sounds a bit odd — but without customers there would be no retail business at all!
Looking after the customer is, therefore, very important; a lot depends on building and maintaining a good relationship with your customers.
Remember:
1
You are there to meet the customer's needs — not to argue with him.
2
Always be polite — even if the customer isn't.
3
Business depends on customers — the customer is not an ‘outsider’.
4
The customer always matters and is never a nuisance — even if she interrupts you in the middle of doing something else.
5
The customer is flesh and blood (like you!) not just a sales statistic.
Different types of customer
Stand quietly for about five minutes in any busy shop and study the different shoppers.
You'll soon begin to notice several different ‘types’ of customer.
If you are a shop assistant, knowing these different types can be a great advantage.
It can help you:
identify their needs more quickly;
adopt the right sales approach to suit that particular customer;
avoid difficult situations.
Here are some of the most common types of customer:
1
The ‘I'm just looking’ customer will browse in various shops, comparing prices and quality.
You need to convince him that your shop offers the best deal.
2
The decisive customer knows what she wants and goes straight to the counter to ask for the item she requires.
All you have to do is give it to her!
3
The uncertain customer isn't really sure what he wants.
You will need to use your knowledge of the product if you are to make a sale.
4
The talkative customer would like to stand and chat all afternoon!
You need firmness and tact to control the situation and make a sale.
5
The silent customer won't tell you much about his needs.
You'll have to do the talking to find out what he wants and lead him to make a purchase.
6
The suspicious customer is always looking for the ‘catch’.
She may have had problems over a similar product, or one from the same manufacturer, before.
You'll need to reassure her about the reliability of your products and the good service your shop offers.
7
The rude customer is unpleasant and difficult to deal with.
Keep calm and don't be offended.
It's probably not you he's annoyed with.

Which ‘type’ of customer is each of the following:
a)
The elderly man who tells you his life history while you're serving him.
b)
The young woman who snaps at you when you ask if you can help her.
c)
The man who persistently questions you about after-sales service.
d)
The customer who ignores you and moves off when you ask if you can help her.
e)
The customer who says ‘I'm not sure’ when you ask if he needs any help.
Customer contact
In person
How to greet a customer
How you greet a customer can leave a lasting impression.
Smile pleasantly and show a real interest in the customer's needs, and you'll probably get a smile and a pleasant response in return.
Give the customer time to explain her needs and listen carefully.
When she has finished, ask questions to help you find out more detail about what she wants.
If the customer is pleased with the service she receives, she'll come back — and may also bring her friends.
The right response and the right attitude
Your response and attitude can help to increase sales — or have the opposite effect.
Try to think before you speak — and watch your words.
Don't keep using expressions such as‘You know ’, ‘Like ’, ‘Er …’ or ‘Um …’— they all make it sound as if you don't really know what you're talking about.
Your appearance matters, too.
What you wear is important.
If you wear an overall, keep it clean and tidy.
If you wear your own clothes, try to make them smart and not too fussy.
Hair, nails and hands should be clean and well cared-for.
All this helps make a good impression on the customer.
By telephone
More and more transactions between customer and retailer are now done by telephone.
The customer may telephone to place an order; to enquire about a product; to ask about days and times of shop opening; to complain about the quality of goods or service, or even to offer a word of praise
The retailer will use the telephone to place orders; to get in touch with other branches or head office; to contact the bank; or to talk to a customer.
Staff working in the office, on the shop floor and in the warehouse may well communicate via the internal telephone system.
A pleasant and correct telephone manner is therefore essential for anyone working in the retail trade.
Here are some hints to help you:
Incoming calls
1
When you pick up the phone, say ‘Good morning afternoon’ and announce the name of the company or department.
Unless you are working on the switchboard or reception, you should also state your name.
2
Ask for the caller's name and use it when you talk to them — this shows you are interested in that individual caller.
But only use the name you are entitled to use (ie say ‘Mr Smith’ not ‘Bert’— even if your boss uses his first name).
3
Be polite and use a pleasant tone of voice.
4
Be brief and don't talk for longer than is necessary — remember, the caller is paying for the call.
5
Be a good listener.
When you reply, use words which let the caller know you are paying attention.
6
Be concise and clear when giving information.
Try to give details in logical order (eg explain when you will have an item in stock before you tell the customer where to park).
7
Make notes as you talk.
8
At the end of the call, quickly run through what has been said, to make sure that you have taken the right order or been given the correct information.
Make sure the person on the other end agrees with you.
9
Thank the person for their call.
Outgoing calls
You may be asked to make telephone calls on behalf of your employer — for example, to order goods from the wholesaler.
Remember these points:
1
Make a list beforehand of all that you need to say.
Note down the sizes, colours, quantities etc that you require, and any other important information (eg dates, times, addresses).
2
Dial the number.
3
Ask for the extension, person or department you require.
4
Be clear about why you are telephoning.
5
Give the order slowly and clearly — remember, someone may be trying to write down what you say.
6
If the order is complicated, ask the person at the other end to read back to you what they have written down, so that you can both check that it is correct.
7
Thank the person at the other end.
Making a sale
With the increase in self-selection and self-service stores the idea of ‘making a sale’ may seem rather old-fashioned.
However it's still a useful skill to learn.
Before you try to make a sale, it's important to find out as much as possible about the products in your department (see the next section on ‘product knowledge’).
There's nothing more irritating than a sales assistant who doesn't know what he's talking about.
Let's take an example.
You work in the Kitchen department of a large store.
A customer is looking at the display of saucepans.
1
Greet the customer.
2
Try to find out what she wants.
Customers thinking about buying a product do not always give a clear indication about what they require.
You may need to ‘decode’ what they are trying to say.
3
Let the customer know that you understand her requirements, eg' I see, you want a set of four saucepans.’
4
If you have a range of similar products (eg saucepans made by different manufacturers) try to find out more detail about what the customer wants.
Ask closed questions, to which she can only say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, eg ‘Do you like the wooden handles?’
5
Sum up what the customer has said, ‘You seem to like the enamel pans best.’
6
Show the customer the saucepans that you feel best meet her requirements.
7
Explain the advantages of these saucepans.
8
Reassure the customer, eg if she says something like ‘Well, I'm not sure.
They're rather more expensive than I was expecting.’
You could reply ‘They will last longer than some of the cheaper brands, and they're under guarantee.’
9
When she says ‘I'll have those saucepans, then.’
you have made your sale.
10
Suggest appropriate extras ‘Have you thought of a stand to store your saucepans on?’
11
For larger items, make arrangements for delivery.
12
Tell the customer the total cost of the purchase and ask method of payment she will use ‘How would you like to pay for the saucepans?’
13
Follow the till/cheque/credit procedure outlined on page 62.
14
Remove security tags and wrap the goods.
15
Thank the customer and say goodbye.
16
Always remain polite and courteous, even if the sale fails.
Assignments
1
Before you can make a sale, you need to find out what the customer really wants.
The following customers aren't very clear about their needs.
For each one:
a)
Write a sentence describing what you think the customer means.
b)
Think of a question you could ask to find out more
Customer 1:'This audio unit is rather large for my lounge .’
Customer 2: ‘/like that wall unit, my own is rather old-fashioned .’
Customer 3:'That looks rather complicated.
I'm not sure I could ever learn to use one .’
Customer 4: ‘I'm only on a pension .’
Customer 5: ‘What happens if my daughter doesn't like this jumper when I get it home ?’
Customer 6: ‘I don't think dresses suit me .’
Customer 7: ‘I like this wallpaper, but it's a pity there is no paint to match it .’
2
In pairs, act out ‘making a sale’.
Decide which one of you will be the sales assistant and which the customer.
Agree on the product to be ‘sold’ and draft out some of the questions you will each want to ask, before you begin.
Product knowledge
As we saw in the last section, knowing your product well helps sell goods.
Whatever the products you sell, the more you know about them, and the more you show that knowledge to potential customers, the better you will be at making sales.
Here are some of the ways you can increase your product knowledge (see also ‘Look at the label’ on page 82):
1
Study the product.
If a new item comes in, have a good look at it.
2
Read the label/packaging/advertisements.
3
Find out what the item is made of (eg if it's wooden — find out what kind of wood it is, and if that has any particular qualities, such as hardness).
4
Find out what it is used for (eg are the apples for eating or cooking with?).
5
Note the range of colours, sizes, styles etc that is available.
6
If the product is electrical or mechanical, find out how it works, where connections fit etc.
7
Make sure you know the care instructions so that you can tell the customer how the item should be washed or stored.
8
Try out the item for yourself (ask permission first).
9
Find out if there are any accessories.
10
In the case of food, find out what ‘extras’ go with the product (eg sage and onion stuffing with turkey, parsley sauce for fish).
For meat, find out what part of the animal different cuts come from.
Assignments
If you already work in retailing, base your answers on products or situations that you have to deal with.
If you don't, try to do some research in a local shop or supermarket.
1
a)
Choose a product and try to find out as much as you can about it.
Draw up a checklist of queries (eg What does it do?
How is it used?
What colours does it come in?) and fill in your answers next to them.
b)
Go through the list and tick any new information you have discovered about the product.
2
Find out as much as you can about an item of equipment that you have at home (eg stereo unit, electric mixer).
Make up a pamphlet giving information about it, to show that you have knowledge of the product concerned.
3
Write to the manufacturer of a product of your choice and ask for further information about it.
4
The following statements may appear on labels or packages, or in manufacturer's instructions.
Write down how you would explain to the customer what each statement means:
a)
Danger, Government Health warning.
b)
Do not use indoors.
c)
Dangerous substance.
d)
Highly inflammable.
e)
Explosive.
f)
Do not exceed the stated dose.
g)
Wash with care.
h)
Do not iron.
i)
Wash separately.
j)
This way up.
5
If you were selling the following items, what additional items would you recommend to the customer, in order to increase sales?
For example, vacuum cleaner — tools, disposable bags, plug
a)
portable radio
b)
washing machine
c)
shoes
d)
handbag
e)
tennis racket
f)
walking boots
g)
bread
h)
golf clubs
i)
spectacles
6
Sort out the jumbled lists below and match up the products and their descriptions, eg PVC raincoat
stainless steel
thermal
diet
quartz
pure wool
biological
real leather
underwear
watch
saucepans
washing powder
lemonade
shoes
sweater
Brand names
Your shop or store may well sell a wide range of similar items produced by different manufacturers.
Sometimes the customer can feel overwhelmed by the choice!
A good sales assistant will be able to help the customer choose between the goods on offer and find the product that meets his or her requirements.
Some retail outlets (eg Sainsburys, Tesco) have their own labels or brand names.
The manufacturer makes products to match the retailer's specifications and these are labelled with the retailer's own distinctive label.
The goods are then distributed to the retail company's outlets throughout the country.
The advantage of own brands for the retailer is that they can only be purchased from that particular company.
If, for example, a customer likes Marks and Spencers' potato crisps, he can only buy more at the same shop (or another branch of Marks and Spencers in a different town).
The advantage for the customer is that own brands are often cheaper than well-known brand names and the customer knows where to obtain the product.
Own brand products usually carry a particular logo or brand name.
For example, Spar products are identified by a small spruce tree logo.
Some retailers use distinctive packaging for their own brands, eg one supermarket chain packaged everything in bright yellow.
This means that customers who like the retailer's own brand goods can quickly identify them on the shelves.
Trade names
A well-known trade name often helps to sell a product.
Some names, such as‘Hoover’ are identified with a particular product to such an extent that many people refer to their vacuum cleaner as ‘the Hoover’.
So, the customer who wants to buy a vacuum cleaner will be familiar with the name Hoover and will therefore look for models produced by this company.
Similarly, customers may ask for ‘Heinz Baked Beans’ because Heinz is a household name.
In each case the company has built up a reputation for reliability and high quality.
Products with well-known trade names sell well on their own — they need little advertising or promotion.
Manufacturers often use distinctive emblems or images to make their products easily-identifiable.
The same image may be used in TV advertisements, on posters, and on the packaging.
A good example is the ‘Dulux’ dog — which is a very successful advertising image, even though dogs have nothing to do with paint!
Assignment
1
Look around your local supermarket/the shop where you work.
Choose an item, eg baked beans, and list the different brand names stocked, eg Heinz, Sainsburys, Crosse and Blackwell, HP…
Try to find out which brand sells best, and why.
2
Conduct a survey among your friends or other students in your group to find out the popularity of a particular product.
For example, you might do a survey on potato crisps.
Ask 10 people:
a)
What is your favourite brand?
b)
Why do you choose that brand?
c)
What is your favourite flavour?
d)
How many packets a week do you eat?
If you were a shop-keeper, how could the information from your survey help you?
Customer motivation
Have you every stopped to think why you've bought something?
Understanding customer motivation (the reasons why we buy things) is an important part of successful retailing.
We all buy things on the spur of the moment — this is what the retail trade calls an ‘impulse buy’.
It means a purchase that hasn't been planned in advance.
Impulse buying is good business!
Retailers use various methods to tempt the customer to buy that extra ‘something’.
We've already seen how carefully planned customer flow can encourage the shopper to leave with a loaded basket when she had only popped in for a loaf of bread or a pint of milk.
Self-selection enables the customer to inspect goods without pressure, and this often results in an impulse purchase.
In addition, the retailer can use various strategies, for example :
1
Special displays placed at the end of a shelf unit or counter, where they catch the customer's eye.
2
Gondolas or bins in strategic positions (placing goods in bins also suggests that they are a special offer).
3
‘Special offer’ notices written on the shop window to attract customers in.
4
Placards advertising good buys — inside and outside the store.
5
People demonstrating how to use a product and/or giving free samples of food or drink.
6
Price reductions.
Advertising (See also Section 7: Marketing)
Impulse buying is only one example of the way we all react, subconsciously, to the pressure to buy.
Another important area is advertising.
Manufacturers and retailers spend a lot of time — and money — on analysing customer motivation and planning advertising campaigns.
The following are just some of the ways the customer is encouraged to part with his money.
‘Lifestyles'
Many advertising campaigns aim to create the impression of a particular lifestyle.
It may be the lifestyle you have already or (more probably) the one you would like to have.
Yogurt manufacturers, for example, portray fit, lively people, glowing with health.
The ‘hidden message’ is that you could be like that too, if you ate X's yogurt.
Advertisements for breakfast cereals may present a happy, harmonious family in a sunny bright kitchen.
Is breakfast like that in your house?
The advertiser seems to suggest that it could be, if you ate their product.
Recently, advertisers have focused on two particular aspects of lifestyle:
Leisure and recreation
Nowadays, people have more time than ever before to devote to leisure and recreation.
The advertising media (that includes TV, magazines and newspapers, posters and packaging) use this to good effect when they encourage us to buy certain products.
Take a barbecue set, for example: in early summer, displays in shops, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, and posters in shop windows encourage us to make use of our spare time, enjoy the outdoor life, invite friends round…and to do this, of course , we need a barbecue set!
Promotions of labour-saving gadgets encourage us to save time on household chores, so that we'll have more time for leisure and recreation.
Health
People are becoming more and more concerned about the healthiness of their diet and way of life.
We are constantly seeing TV programmes and newspaper/magazine articles that tell us how bad some things are for us.
Advertisers have been quick to cash-in on this new health-consciousness.
All sorts of products, from margarine to toothpaste, are promoted as being good for us.
Advertisements, packages and labels all stress that their product contains only natural ingredients, since ‘natural’ things are supposed to be better for us.
Everyone wants to be healthy.
The advertisements show healthy, happy families.
If you don't give your family healthy food like ‘X’, the advertisers seem to say to parents, you can't really love them.
Famous names
Some advertisements rely on ‘famous names’ to sell their products.
Personalities
Many advertisements use well-known people such as TV personalities, sports stars etc to promote the sales of products.
This gives the customer a feeling of exclusiveness.
If you buy the same make of jeans as your favourite film-star, you can imagine that you, too, are rich, talented and good-looking.
Designer labels
In the past, only very wealthy people could afford ‘designer’ clothes made by the top fashion houses.
The clothes were exclusive, and expensive.
Nowadays, many top designers also produce mass-produced goods which we can buy in the local department store.
But wearing a garment with a ‘Pierre Cardin' or ‘Gucci ’ label still makes us feel exclusive.
Designer labels don't only apply to clothes.
Furniture, sports equipment etc may all be bought because of the ‘name’ it carries.
The company name signifies high quality, style and good taste and advertisements are designed to emphasise this 
Assignments
1
a)
Name two products (other than the barbecue) designed to help people enjoy their leisure time.
b)
How were these products advertised?
What sort of lifestyle/ did they present?
2
a)
Name three products that are promoted as being ‘labour saving’.
b)

a)
Name three well-known personalities who appear in advertisements, and the products they promote.

Dealing with problems
An important part of good customer relations is knowing how to deal with problems or complaints.
Your company will probably have guidelines on how to handle such situations.
Whatever happens, remember: KEEP CALM and BE POLITE.
If the customer feels that her request or complaint has been dealt with pleasantly and fairly, she is likely to come back again and make further purchases.
If, on the other hand, she is offended by the attitude of the shop assistants, she won't come back again.
Exchanging goods
Anyone working in the retail trade will often have to deal with customers who want to exchange or return goods.
The item may be faulty, or the wrong size/colour, or the customer may have been given it as a present.
The procedure for exchanging goods varies from shop to shop, but may include:
calling a more senior member of staff
asking for a receipt or other proof of purchase
checking the item
offering a replacement
offering a credit voucher
offering a cash refund
Incorrect change
On page 74 you read about the procedure for giving change.
One of the reasons for following a routine like this is so that you are less likely to make a mistake.
Sometimes, however, a customer will complain that he has been given incorrect change.
If this happens:
1
Be polite.
Explain the procedure for giving change and check that you followed it.
2
Call a more senior member of staff or
3
Ask the customer to call back the next day, when the contents of the till will have been checked.
Other situations
As a shop assistant you may from time to time need to be helpful, tactful, firm or sympathetic!
Examples of the sorts of situations that may arise include:
a customer has a minor accident on the premises (eg an elderly person falls down)
a customer loses money/leaves behind an item of clothing
a customer wants to know where a certain product can be obtained
a customer is examining goods while smoking a cigarette
a customer's children are playing roughly with goods while you are serving the customer
you suspect a customer may be shoplifting
(See also Section 8: The Law and Appendix B on First Aid)
These are just a few of the situations that you may have to tackle from time to time.
Once again, remember, KEEP CALM and BE POLITE!
Assignments
For each of the situations below, write a short passage explaining how you would deal with it.
(IF you already work in retailing, find out what your company's procedures are.)
1
A customer returns a blanket claiming that he discovered a hole in it when he got home.
2
A customer returns a skirt because the zip broke the first time she wore it.
3
A customer returns a pair of shoes that the heel has come off.
He says he only bought them 10 days ago, but he doesn't have a receipt to prove it.
4
A pregnant lady faints on the shop premises.
5
A man buys a razor and shaving cream and later returns saying you have only given him change for £5 instead of £10.
6
A customer slips and falls on the shop floor — the floor was still greasy after an assistant had broken a bottle of salad cream, although the breakage had been cleaned up.
7
An old lady pays for the loaf and ½; lb butter in her wire basket, but you notice a jar of your own brand coffee in her shopping bag.
8
A busy father is paying for a basket of green-  groceries .
You notice his young daughter eating grapes from the display box.
LOOKING AFTER THE STOCK
Introduction
If you get a job in the warehouse or stock-room of a retailing firm, you will soon find out just how important it is to look after the stock properly.
Damaged stock means lost sales, and lost sales mean less profit.
If the retailer doesn't make a profit, he may go out of business.
But looking after the stock doesn't only mean handling it carefully; it also means planning stock levels, ordering goods and storing them.
This section looks at just what is involved.
Stock and stock control
What is stock?
Stock is the merchandise or goods stored on the premises of the retail outlet where it is to be sold.
If someone asks ‘How much of X do we have in stock ?’ they want to know how many of a specific item there are on the premises — both on the shop floor and in the warehouse or storeroom.
Stock levels
The stock level is the number of a particular product that is kept in stock.
The retailer has to work out what the ideal stock level will be, and try to keep numbers very close to that.
Having more than the ideal number can be a problem — it doesn't mean that any more will be sold, and the rest will sit on the shelf ‘doing nothing’.
The money spent on these products could have been used for something else.
Moreover, if the retailer has too much stock of perishable goods, items may deteriorate or pass their ‘sell by’ date before they are sold.
The reverse of this is also true.
Having too few of a product in stock can lead to lost sales if the item runs out before a new delivery arrives.
If the stock level is consistently too low, lost sales may eventually lead to lost jobs.
Stock control
Stock control means keeping the correct balance between the range of products stocked by the retailer, and the sales which arise from carrying that stock.
Unit stock control (where each item is individually counted) is a method used by retailers to calculate how much stock they have on the premises, including the warehouse or store-room.
It provides the retailer with valuable information about:
which products are selling best
which sizes are selling best
which colours are the most popular
which items are selling slowly
what to re-order
results of special sales campaigns or promotions
This information helps the retailer plan for the future and order stock to match changes in customers' buying habits.
For example, checking stock records for previous years can help the retailer see when to increase stocks of swimwear (spring and early summer) and when to let them run down (winter).
It will also help him set the stock level for each item, so that he has sufficient stock, but not too much.
Stock checking
Stock checking is another form of stock control.
The small retailer, such as the ‘corner shop’, tends to rely on doing a regular stock-check: this means looking at what goods are on the shelves in the shop and the stockroom, and making a note of any items that are ‘getting low’.
This method of stock control is not ideal.
Products often sell out before the retailer notices, and sales are lost as a result.
Stock records
Stock record systems vary — from simple cards, kept in a file or drawer along with the goods, to complex computerised systems used by big companies.
Whatever the method, it is vital to keep accurate, up-to-date figures so that the retailer can maintain the ideal stock level.
Assignments

Draw up two stock record cards like the one on page 108 and fill in the following information:
a)
b)
c)
Work out the stock balance that applies to each entry by subtracting the quantity issued from the quantity received.
Then add the previous stock balance to find the total in stock.

Ordering goods
When a retailer sees that stocks of a particular item are running low, or if he wants to sell a new product, he will order a supply of goods.
Goods may be ordered in several ways:
by selecting items from catalogues issued by manufacturers and wholesalers
by sending an official order form
by writing to a manufacturer, or using a printed enquiry form, asking for a quotation
Order forms
In most cases, the retailer will be familiar with a manufacturer's range of products and will be ordering further supplies of an item he usually stocks.
The request will be entered on an order form like the one below:
The order form will include some or all of the following information:
1
The shop's name and address
2
The name and address of the supplier
3
A reference number
4
The date of the order
5
The date of delivery
6
The quantities of goods required
7
Description of the goods
8
Price of the goods
9
Any special conditions added by the retailer, eg ‘If the goods are not delivered on time the order will be cancelled.’
An order is a legal contract.
If the sellers (in this case the manufacturer or wholesaler) do not keep their part of the bargain, the contract is broken.
The purchaser (in this case the retailer) can refuse to accept the goods if they arrive later than the agreed delivery date.
This is a fair arrangement.
If, for example, the retailer required a supply of cards for Mother's Day, they would be little use to him if they arrived afterwards.
When a retailer has placed an order with a manufacturer, he enters it on to a stock record card.
This shows that more stock has been ordered, and when it is due.
Catalogues from manufacturers or wholesalers usually include an order form.
The retailer selects the items he wants and fills in the form as outlined above.
Enquiry form or letter of enquiry
If the retailer requires a product with which he is unfamiliar, he may begin by sending a letter of enquiry to the manufacturer.
This will include the following information:
1
The shop's name and address
2
The manufacturer's name and address
3
A reference number
4
The date
5
A request for details of the product (including the price) and/or a request for a catalogue or leaflet with further information
6
The date by which goods are required
Alternatively, a retailer may have a supply of printed enquiry forms.
Most information is already printed on the form, and the retailer only has to add:
1
The manufacturer's name and address
2
A reference number
3
The date
4
Description of the item required
The quotation
When the retailer receives an answer to his enquiry, giving the information he requested, he may decide to write to the manufacturer again, asking for a quotation for a large quantity of the product.
If retailers buy in large quantities (buying in bulk) the manufacturer will probably offer a discount (ie provide the goods at a slightly reduced price).
The manufacturer's quotation will give information about the price of the product and any special terms (eg discount for cash payment within seven days).
Receiving goods into stock
When the goods have been dispatched, the manufacturer sends an advice note to the retailer informing him of the date and time of dispatch.
A delivery note is sent along with the goods — this enables the retailer to check that the delivery he receives matches the one dispatched by the manufacturer.
Many shops and stores have a special delivery area, usually at the rear of the store.
Goods can be unloaded and dealt with as soon as they arrive from the manufacturer.
The procedure for receiving stock is usually as follows:
1
Goods are unloaded
2
Deliveries are checked for damage and/or shortages (the advice note/delivery note will have a record of what should have been sent)
3
The delivery note is signed and the driver retains one copy.
Any shortages are recorded on the delivery note so that the supplier can correct the shortfall.
4
Deliveries are recorded in a ‘goods received’ book.
(Smaller companies may not have a special book, but instead keep the advice/delivery note on file)
5
Goods are moved into the warehouse, checked and then transferred to their storage space.
Large packages may be unloaded onto pallets and moved by fork-lift truck.
The invoice
At the end of the month following the delivery of the order, the manufacturer will send the retailer an invoice or bill, similar to the one below:
An invoice will usually give:
1
The manufacturer's name and address
2
The retailer's name and address
3
The date
4
The retailer's order number
5
The full price of the goods (including any VAT)
6
The terms of payment (eg 2.5% discount, if paid within seven days)
Note that VAT (value added tax) is worked out on the price after discount, ie £360 -2.5% cash discount = £351.00
If the supplier offers special terms, eg 2.5% discount if the account is paid within seven days, the sum owed on the bill or invoice is calculated as follows:
Cost of one trowel = £1.50 therefore 240 trowels cost £1.50 x 240 = £360.00 However, the cash discount is deducted before the VAT is added: £360 less 2.5% discount = £351
This can be shown as: 1% = £3.60 2% = £7.20 0.5% = £1.80
The total discount is therefore: £7.20 + £1.80 = £9.00
The VAT is then calculated on total cost less discount.
To calculate the
VAT on £351 we would multiply £351 by 15%.
This can be shown as: £351 × 15% = £52.65 The total cost of the goods is therefore £351 + £52.65 = £403.65
A pro forma invoice may be sent before goods are delivered: if the customer is a new one and the manufacturer doesn't know if he will pay his bills; or if the goods are being sent on approval and may later be returned to the manufacturer.
Statement
At the end of each month, the supplier will send the retailer a statement.
This gives details of the retailer's account and contains the following information:
1
What goods have been bought during that month
2
The cost of the goods
3
How much the retailer has paid the supplier during that month
4
Any credit due or debit due
5
Whether there is any money owing from the previous month
6
Whether the account has been paid in full 
7
The amount of VAT that has been charged
8
If any trade discount is given
Credit notes
If the retailer does not receive some of the goods he ordered, or if any items are damaged and have to be returned, the manufacturer or wholesaler may issue a credit note.
This will usually show the sum to be deducted from the invoice for the goods in question (ie how much will be taken off the retailer's bill).
The credit note may also cover the cost of pallets, crates and packaging materials returned to the manufacturer, which the retailer would have been charged for on the original invoice.
The supplier may send the retailer a debit note if for some reason the retailer has been under-charged and actually owes the supplier more money than was shown on the original invoice.
To sum up, the sequence in which documents are issued in the purchasing and receipt of goods can be seen below:
1
Quotation or enquiry note
2
Order sent
3
‘On order’ entered on stock record card
4
Supplier dispatches goods and sends advice note
5
Delivery note accompanies goods
6
Goods received and checked (copy of delivery note or goods received note issued by warehouse or stores)
7
‘Goods received’ entered on stock record card
8
Supplier sends invoice
9
Supplier sends statement
After receiving the invoice, the retailer will send a cheque to the supplier covering some, or all, of the cost of the order.
A note on discount
Cash discounts
A supplier may offer a cash discount to a retailer who settles his account promptly.
For example, if the account is settled within seven days, the supplier may offer 7.5% discount on the bill.
If a longer period of time is allowed (say, 14 days) the rate of discount will be lower (say, 2.5%).
The advantages to the supplier of having prompt payment outweigh the cost of providing this discount, as well as offering an incentive to retailers to trade with that supplier.
Trade discount
Suppliers may offer a trade discount to customers who work in the same business.
For example, a warehouse selling car spares may give a discount of 20% to a garage buying spare parts.
If goods are offered in a catalogue sent to those in the trade, a similar discount will be given.
The advantage to the supplier is that this enables him to build up links with a number of regular customers.
Some suppliers offer both trade and cash discounts:

Handling and storing stock
Storage
Damaged goods mean lost profit!
The retailer needs to pay attention to where and how he stores goods.
A damaged or dirty item cannot be sold.
1
The stock room or warehouse should not be damp, or very hot/cold; it should be kept clean and tidy (dusty packets and rusty tins are not saleable).
2
Stock should be handled carefully and put away immediately it has been checked in (using stock rotation methods — see below).
3
Fast-moving items should be stored at ground level, slow-moving stock higher up.
4
It's important to follow the instructions on the outer carton, eg ‘Stack no more than 6 cases high’.
5
The layout of the stock room is important.
Highly-perfumed products such as soap should not be next to foodstuffs which may become contaminated.
Types of stock which need special care
1
Frozen foods need constant refrigeration until sold to the customer.
If frozen food has thawed out it should NEVER be re-frozen — this is a potential health hazard.
2
Clothing, bedding, curtains etc must be kept dry and free from dust.
3
Electrical equipment must be kept dry.
4
Products which may be damaged by heat (eg chocolate, candles) should be stored in a cool area, away from direct sunlight.
5
Highly-inflammable products (eg petrol, paraffin) must be kept in a ‘No smoking’ zone.
6
Biscuits, cereals etc must be protected from mice and other vermin.
7
Expensive and valuable stock should be kept in a high-security area, such as a special locked ‘cage’.
Stock rotation
Stock rotation simply means that goods are moved so that older stocks are sold before new supplies.
In the stock room there is usually a system of storing goods so that new deliveries are stacked or placed behind older stock.
Stock rotation also operates on the shop floor — the shelf-stacker moves older products to the front of the display or shelf, and adds new supplies behind them.
This is particularly important for perishable goods and dated items.
Reliable stock rotation means that goods with a close sell-by date will be sold before goods with a longer life-span.
Handling stock on the shop floor
As we have seen, it's important to store stock safely.
It's equally important that goods don't get damaged on their way to the shop floor, or when they arrive there.
1 All stock should be handled as little as possible.
When it is necessary to move stock, it should be handled with care (and hands should be clean).
2 Fabrics and clothing should be covered over at night, to prevent dust settling on the stock.
3 Stock should be arranged neatly in drawers or on shelves 5 When goods have been taken out (eg to be shown to a customer) they should be returned to their correct storage place.

MARKETING
Introduction
When a retailer is thinking of opening a shop, or a multiple chain wants to open a new branch, there are four things they need to get right: place product price promotions
These four ‘p's are the basis of marketing.
If the retailer gets them right, he will make a profit 
The place and the product
Have you ever been interviewed in the street, or at your door, by someone doing a survey?
They may have asked you about your work, your leisure activities and the things you buy.
This type of survey is part of market research.
Market research plays an important part in the planning of any new retail outlet; it may also help a retailer decide what products to stock.
and whether to introduce a new line.
Socioeconomics
The researcher's job is to gather information about people: their ages, occupations, income and buying habits.
All this helps the researcher build up a picture of the socioeconomics of an area.
Companies who want to open a new store or shop often do a lot of research into socioeconomics.
They need to find out whether there is a market, in that town or location, for the product they sell.
For example, it would be foolish to open a DIY hypermarket in a town where 90% of inhabitants were old-age pensioners and 75% of the population lived in rented accommodation (older people in rented housing clearly don't carry out as many home repairs or alterations as people, say, in their 30s and 40s who own their own homes).
Similarly, it would be risky to open a superstore selling luxury kitchens and accessories m an area where there is high unemployment and many people can only afford essential items such as food and clothing.
Socioeconomic groups
As well as identifying whole areas which may be ‘good’ or ‘bad’in terms of business, market research helps retailers find out about particular socio-economic or social and economic groups.
Such groups might be:
the elderly
the young
the unemployed
the employed
children
handicapped people
particular ethnic groups
There may be a particular group of people who will buy a company's products (eg it would be good business sense to open a stationer's shop near a University, where there will be a lot of students).
The typical customer
Market research can also help the retailer identify the needs of the ‘typical’ customer in an area.
This is useful if the retailer wants to introduce a new product, or line of products.
If, for example, a survey showed that 80% of people in an area were concerned about their  health and their diet, the retailer might consider stocking a line of health foods and ‘natural’ products.
The last thing the retailer wants is to be left with a lot of stock that doesn't sell.
Products not sold mean ‘dead money’— that is, money tied up which cannot therefore be used elsewhere.
That money could have been used:
to buy more goods to replace those sold
to extend the range of products sold
to employ more staff or pay higher wages
to make more profit
to improve facilities and equipment in the shop
Interviewing techniques
Anyone doing market research wants to find out as much information as possible in as little time as possible.
The best questions to ask in a survey are those which require only a single word/phrase or a ‘yes’ or ‘no’answer.
It is important to interview people from different age-groups — but a lot of people don't like giving away their age!
The easiest way to find out people's ages is to ask what age group they fit into, ie -10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60, 60–70, 70+
Imagine you were trying to find out if a DIY store would do well in your area.
First of all, what sort of questions would you need to ask?
They might include:
1
Do you live in this area?
2
How did you travel here?
3
Are you employed?
4
If so, what work do you do?
5
Do you get paid monthly or weekly?
6
Do you own your own home?
7
Do you carry out your own repairs in the home?
8
Do you have a garden?
9
Where do you go if you need: wallpaper, garden fertiliser, plants, a saw?
10
If there was a hypermarket in the area which sold all these items, would you go there?
Once you have decided on the questions you want to ask, you should draw up a chart like A on which you can record customer's responses quickly, simply by ticking or filling in the appropriate column.
Rules for doing a survey
The way the interviewer approaches people is very important.
Here are some guidelines:
1
Choose a busy area, but make sure you don't get in people's way (eg by blocking the entrance or exit of a shop).
2
When you approach someone, smile and greet them politely.
3
Explain what you are doing, eg ‘I am conducting a survey on behalf of × DIY store.
Could you help me, please?’
4
If people refuse, don't be offended.
Thank them politely and choose someone else.
5
Always thank a person for their time.
At the end of your survey, your chart would probably look something like B .
The clearest way to present these findings is in graph form.
The following bar graphs or charts show how the information can be broken down and looked at more closely.
Now you need to analyse the results of the survey.
The marketing team of the DIY company would probably discuss some of the following questions as they looked at the bar charts:
1
Were at least 75% of those interviewed employed?
2
Were at least 50% of those interviewed working in offices, banks, schools or highly-skilled work?
3
Did at least 75% have their own transport?
4
Did at least 50% get paid monthly?
5
Did at least 75% own their own home?
6
Did at least 50% do their own repairs?
7
Did at least 50% have a garden?
8
Did at least 50% of those interviewed state that they would buy the products mentioned from a hypermarket if there was one in the area?
What do you think?
On the basis of the information in this section, would you recommend that your company opened a DIY hypermarket in the area, or not?
Give reasons for your answer.
Assignments
1
Carry out some market research for yourself to find out about the ‘typical’ customer.
If you already work in a shop, ask your supervisor/ manager if you can interview some of the customers.
If not, a local shopkeeper may be willing to help.
The length of time you need to spend on your survey depends on how busy your shop is.
You'll probably need about two hours.
Copy chart C on to a large piece of paper.
It helps if you can fix this to a clipboard for your survey.
When you have finished your survey, draw a series of bar charts to demonstrate your findings (eg number of customers in each age-range, distance travelled, average spending etc).
You should now be able to picture the typical customer.
Draw a customer profile and write a description of your typical customer, explaining what age and sex they are, how far away they live, how they travel, how often they come, how much they spend, and any other information you found out.
2
Bar charts are a useful way of looking at sets of figures.
If the retailer wants to find out about sales figures, for example, he may present information as a bar chart.
For the shop you work in/ a shop you know:
a)
Draw bar charts for:
the number of people served each morning for a week
how much each customer spent and how many items they bought
the number of people served each afternoon
how much each customer spent and how many items they bought
b) From the information gathered, work out:
which day was busiest
which period of each day was busiest
the average number of customers over the week (add each day's total customers together, then divide that total by the number of days in the working week).
Customer profile Sex: female Average age: 30–40 Occupation: Housewife/mother Travels: 200 metres Walks to the shop Shops 3–4 times a week Buys mainly basic items Spends on average £13 per visit
3
Typical customers
a)
Match up the potential customers below with the sort of shop you think they would buy from.
shopkeeper
teenager
pensioner
keep-fit enthusiast
business person
student
city worker
busy mother
cut price store
well known chain store
fashion shop
hypermarket second hand shop
freezer centre
health food store
warehouse
b)
Choose one of the shops and list the questions you would ask if you wanted to find out whether it was needed in your area.
4
Look around your shop and try to identify products which do not sell well (or ask the manager).
Select three of the items and:
a)
Count how many of each of the three products the shop has on its premises
b)
Find out what the goods cost the retailer
c)
Find out the selling price of the goods
d)
Calculate the difference between the cost to the retailer and the selling price
e)
For each product, multiply the number of items by the difference you found in d)
f)
Add together the figures you obtained.
This will tell you how much ‘dead money’ is tied up in the three products.
g)
Find out if there is any special reason for these three products being on sale which may make it worthwhile for the shop to stock them, even though they sell slowly.
Competitors
Just as athletes compete against each , so do retailers.But whereas amateur athletes often compete just for the privilege of winning, retailers compete for customers and profit.
Competition, therefore, is something the retailer has to consider very carefully.
For example, is it good business sense to open a fish and chip shop in a row of shops which already includes a burger bar, a Chinese take-away and an Indian restaurant.
The answer might be ‘Yes’— but only if the market research has shown that a lot of people in the area would buy fish and chips.
There are other, less obvious forms of competition.
A High Street clothes shop, for example, may not only have to compete with another clothes retailer in that street, but also with the large department store in the town centre, plus mail order companies.
A ‘corner’ shop selling food and other everyday items may have to compete with both larger and smaller retailers — the supermarket or out-of-town hypermarket on the one hand, the local market stall on the other.
Competition also affects retail outlets which offer a service, such as hairdressing or dry cleaning.
How will the manager of ‘Jean's salon’ react, for example, when ‘Hairstyles UK’opens just a few doors away?
Competition among retailers is good news for the customer.
It means that a wider range of goods is often available, and retailers are more likely to introduce special offers and price reductions to attract custom away from their competitors.
One of the main ‘weapons’ retailers use in their battle for customers is advertising, and we will look at this in the next section.
Assignments

The Price
We have seen how important it is for the retailer to choose the right place and the right product.
The next thing the retailer has to get right is the price of the goods he sells.
When was the last time you bought an item at one shop, only to find that the same item was much cheaper in another shop?
Why is there such a difference?
Except in a few cases, where the law states that a product must be sold at a fixed price (ie all retailers must charge the same price), retailers can charge what they like!
That is, the retailer can decide how much profit he wants to make on an item (see page 145).
Profits range from as little as 10% on some food products to over 400% on some luxury items.
Of course it's not as easy as that.
A retailer only makes a profit if he sells goods — and if customers think products are too expensive, they will go elsewhere.
Customers want value for money, and retailers use different strategies to convince the customer that she is getting a bargain.
For example, the retailer may decide not to make a profit on a particular item.
Both large and small stores use ‘loss leaders’ to attract customers.
These are items which are sold at little or no profit (they may include special cut-price reductions, or offers like ‘buy two, get one free’…
). Once inside the store, the retailer hopes, the customer will not only buy the product on offer, but also many other items, which are sold at a much higher profit.
Trading policy
The trading policy a company adopts dictates the price of goods on sale.
This is also reflected in the type of service and display and the quality and range of goods on offer.
Put simply, the retailer must decide whether he is going to opt for ‘quality’ or ‘quantity’.
In order to make this decision, the retailer needs to do some market research into the socioeconomics of the area.
A department store like Harrods, which sells more expensive products, would be inappropriate in an area where 75% of people are out of work, just as a cut-price ‘saver’ store would not really fit in Knightsbridge.
Low quality trading policy
Cut-price stores and ‘saver’ stores operate a low quality trading policy.
They usually offer:
low prices
self-service
few extra facilities (eg deliveries)
a limited range of goods
medium quality goods
Companies with a low quality trading policy need to keep down their overheads (see page 147).
They usually employ many part-time staff since this reduces the amount of National Insurance contributions the company has to pay.
They do not price items individually (this is expensive in terms of staff time) but instead show the price on the shelves.
Sometimes goods are displayed in their original packaging.
The retailer concentrates on a limited range of everyday items which he knows will sell quickly — you are unlikely to find goods which are not in regular use in the home.
High quality trading policy
Shops which operate a high quality trading policy usually offer:
personal service
average to high prices
high-quality goods
a wide range of goods
specialist products (eg ingredients for foreign cookery)
A shop with a high quality trading policy makes its profits from charging higher prices.
In return, it offers the customer improved service and facilities.
Staffing levels are high, and staff are usually paid well.
The shop may also stock unusual items which customers would be unable to obtain elsewhere, or more ‘exclusive’ fashions etc.
Of course, many retail outlets fall between these two extremes and can be said to operate a medium quality trading policy.

Promotions: advertising
Aims of advertising
The main aims of advertising are:
1
To increase sales
2
To build up a shop's reputation in the public eye (ie to make customers more aware of the shop and the goods it offers, and to convince them that it provides good value and good service)
Increasing sales
A good advertising campaign will increase sales, but if the products themselves are of poor quality the improvement will only be temporary.
If the products are high quality, customers who have been persuaded to buy them by the advertising campaign will continue to buy, and the increase in sales will be long-lasting.
Promotional advertising informs the public of an item or range of items in stock.
The aim is not only to increase sales of these products, but also to encourage customers to buy other goods at the same time.
Building up the shop's reputation
A good advertising campaign will begin even before a shop opens.
The first thing any retailer needs to do is let people know he is there!
When a new retail outlet is about to open, the company will launch an advertising and promotional campaign.
The retailer needs to ask himself ‘How am I going to tell people about my shop and the range of goods it sells?’.
The campaign may include a ‘splash’ in the local  newspaper, an item on local radio, handbills and posters and perhaps even an official ‘opening’by a famous personality.
This sort of launch will attract plenty of people, but the retailer then needs to make sure that they keep on coming, by continuing to advertise.
An advertising campaign may create or build up a shop's reputation by using a particular approach or ‘angle’.
For example, the advertising may:
emphasise the wide range of goods stocked
emphasise the exclusivity of goods
announce low prices or price reductions
point out a specialist department or service not available anywhere else
Planning the advertising programme
Most retailers want to achieve both of the above aims, so they need to plan the most appropriate advertising campaign.
In deciding just what sort of advertising he needs, and what he wants to advertise, the retailer must consider a number of factors, including:
store size
the character of the store (eg is it a ‘popular price’ store?)
how prices compare with those of competitors (Are they lower/ higher/the same?)
the situation of the store (Is it in a busy shopping area or in a less advantageous situation where he may need to attract customers?)
the strength of competition
who the advertising will be aimed at (What socio-economic groups are there?
What are the needs of the typical customer?)
The advertising budget
The amount of money the retailer spends on advertising depends on the amount of money the shop takes in a year.
A percentage of the takings is usually allocated to advertising: this is the advertising budget.
The budget varies from store to store and shop to shop, depending on the attitude of the retailer.
An average figure for retail outlets is 2.5% of annual takings.
Retail outlets in towns and busy shopping centres, which face tougher competition, spend more on advertising than a village shop, which may have no competitors nearby.
Timing
Once the budget is decided, the retailer needs to draw up a plan of how that money is to be spent.
The first consideration is likely to be timing.
When and how is the money to be spent?
(It would clearly be a mistake to spend it all at once and then not be able to advertise for the rest of the year.)
The advertising budget may be divided as follows:
in two half yearly (six month) sessions
in four quarterly (three month) sessions
in 12 monthly sessions
The timing depends on the nature of the goods being advertised, eg seasonal items such as clothes will require a different time-scale from food items, where advertisements may change monthly or even weekly.
Forms of advertising
The budget available may well determine what form of advertising a retailer chooses.
A local corner shop, for example, is not likely to advertise on national TV!
The retailer is more likely to choose a  combination of posters and displays, with perhaps an advertisement in the local newspaper.
The following are some of the most popular forms of advertising:
Local newspapers
Local newspapers often offer fairly low-priced advertising deals.
The number of potential customers reached by the local press may stretch into hundreds of thousands, depending on the newspaper's circulation.
(However, it's worth remembering that many readers skip the advertisement sections.)
Radio, television and cinema advertising is often combined with advertisements in the press.
Regional television
TV advertising is too expensive for the small, independent retailer.
However, a group of retailers, eg Spar or VG grocers, may join together to advertise effectively and at a reasonable cost.
Similarly a group of retailers located in a particular shopping centre may combine forces to advertise that centre as a whole.
Commercial radio
The local radio is another useful means of advertising that can reach a wide audience of potential customers.
Cinema
Advertisements at the cinema reach a ‘captive’ audience, unlike TV or radio, where the viewer or listener may be distracted or switch off.
Evidence suggests that cinema audiences are more receptive to advertising — although numbers are limited.
Mail advertising
A shop may have a mailing list of customers to whom the retailer sends information about new lines, special offers etc.
Although numbers are limited, customers on the mailing list are generally people who have bought that retailer's goods, or expressed interest, in the past, and may be likely to buy again.
This personal approach to the customer is very effective.
Mail advertisements range from the single, printed sheet through to glossy colour catalogues.
Often these advertisements are delivered by hand, which is cheaper than using the postal service.
Some retailers also distribute simple handbills to passing shoppers, notifying them of a shop opening, special offers or sales.
Posters and signs
Posters and signs may be placed anywhere they will catch the eye of potential customers: on hoardings, walls and windows, on boards outside the shop; on vehicles and delivery vans; inside and outside buses.
More permanent neon signs and eye-catching shop names also help attract customers.
Free gifts may also carry the name of a shop or restaurant (eg match books, pens) or the retailer may employ a person to carry a ‘sandwich board’ around the streets or shopping precinct.
Displays
Effective window dressing and attractive in-store displays are an important form of advertising (see below page 139.)
The retailer may combine various forms of advertising in a promotions campaign, depending on what products he wants to promote, and the way he wants to use the advertising.
This may include:
general advertising of many products throughout the store
promotions of specific products in separate departments
advertising of particular products which bring high profits
features on seasonal products (eg suntan oils)
features on new lines
promotions to stimulate sales of particularly attractive goods
Promotions of products advertised by the media or on TV
What to advertise
Next the retailer needs to choose what to advertise.
The products chosen must have good sale possibilities and improve the general ‘image’ of the store.
The retailer's knowledge of the area and her customers, together with the results of any market research, will also affect her choice of what goods to promote in an advertising campaign.
In a large store, the department heads will get together to discuss suggestions of the most suitable products.
Both the big store and the smaller, independent retailer will assess the stock carried and any national advertising programmes in the pipeline, before deciding what product to promote.
Timing is also important to the choice of products.
The retailer needs to know the best time to advertise seasonal goods — eg camping equipment will be promoted in the spring, ready for the summer.
The results
Another important element the retailer may consider in planning an advertising campaign is the success (or failure) of earlier promotions.
Analysing how effective they were will help him improve future advertising by repeating successful strategies and finding out what went wrong with those that failed.
The results of advertising can be seen immediately, in terms of increased sales.
But to work out how successful a campaign has been, the retailer needs to balance the profit made against the amount of money he spent on the campaign.
It's no use increasing sales by £500 if the campaign itself cost £1000!
If the advertising appears to have failed, the retailer needs to find out why.
Did bad weather affect sales?
Was enough window space or in-store display given to the product to support the advertisement?
Was the product right for the area?

How does advertising work?
Advertising is big business!
Every day we encounter advertisements all around us: on hoardings and posters, on TV and radio, in newspapers and magazines.
The advertisements all have one thing in common: they want to persuade you to buy a product.
But they use many different methods to achieve that aim.
Advertisements may appeal to our senses — smell, taste, touch, hearing, sight.
Or they may appeal to our feelings — advertisements that evoke nostalgia, or involve appealing children and animals; that make us laugh or rely on sex appeal, are all playing on our emotions to persuade us to buy.
For example, a TV advertisement for bread ‘like Mum used to make’ might involve an old-fashioned film set and 1930s music, with healthy, wholesome-looking actors.
It aims to make people think of ‘the good old days’ when life was slow and simple and food was tasty and natural.
Of course, life wasn't really like that, but the advertisers want us to believe it was, and that eating their product will help us recapture the feeling — and the taste.
Or an advertisement may imply that ‘If you love your family/ children/cat/dog, you'll give them product X’.
Of course, no-one wants to feel that they don't love their family enough!
This sort of advertising plays on people's sense of guilt.
Competition is another advertising strategy.
Batteries are said to ‘last longer’, tissues are ‘softer and stronger’, detergent ‘washes whiter’.
Advertisers are not allowed to name other products, or claim that theirs is ‘the best’, but these vague comparisons imply that brand X is better than all the opposition.
Other important elements in advertising include:
1
Music This is often used to create a particular ‘mood’.
A famous advertisement for cigars relied almost entirely on Bach's Air on a G String to create an atmosphere of tranquillity and relaxation.
2
Catchy slogans and jingles Words and phrases that stick in your mind may well prompt you to buy a product when you see it in the supermarket.
3
Famous personalities (see also p101 ) The advertisers want you to think ‘If X buys that, it must be good.’
Assignments
1
Think of six advertisements currently on TV.
List them, and for each one write a brief sentence explaining what senses and/or emotions it appeals to, and what techniques it uses (ie music, a slogan, a personality etc).
2
In pairs, think of five well-known advertising slogans or jingles.
Take turns to say (or sing) the slogan, leaving out the brand name.

3
Write down the names of four records/pieces of music you would use in advertisements.
For each one, say:
a)
What product it would advertise.
b)
Why you chose that music (eg to create an atmosphere, because the words match the product, etc).
4
Select six magazine or newspaper advertisements.
For each one, explain:
a)
Which method of appeal is being used to sell the product.
b)
Why you think the advertiser has chosen that method and how it is used.

2
Free gifts
3
Publicity (leaflets, posters etc)
4
Window displays
5
Shop floor displays
6
Competitions
7
Trading stamps
8
Services or offers (eg demonstrations, food tasting, free gifts)
9
Promotions of novelties and new lines
10
‘Cut-price’ offers and Sales
Promotions aim to attract the customer's attention to a new product or range of products.
Having attracted our attention, of course, the retailer hopes that we will buy.
Many stores, particularly supermarkets, always have some special offers (price reductions, or ‘free’ extras).
The retailer frequently changes the products on offer — often every week or every month.
We all succumb to these tempting offers sometimes: if we think we're getting something cheaper, or for nothing, we'll buy almost anything!
But remember — the retailer may appear to be giving something away, but he's in business to make sales.
Some shops have special ‘cut price’ days or sales seasons.
The January Sales have become a major event — many people queue overnight in London's Oxford Street so they can be first through the doors of the big department stores.
Probably the biggest advertising campaigns are those leading up to Christmas.
Planning starts many months in advance.
The following case study may give you some idea of what is involved.
Christmas Campaign
You work in the CARD CABIN — a shop which sells cards, calendars, wrapping paper, gift tags etc.
You are asked to devise a promotional advertising campaign for next Christmas.
Your plan might look something like this:
1
Check when Christmas cards and special lines will be delivered (the order was placed just after Easter).
2
Think about how you want the shop to look.
What sort of impact do you want to make on the customer?
Draw a sketch plan of what you expect the finished shop to look like.
3
Decide how to arrange the display units.
You will need sections for:
titled Christmas cards (eg Mother, Husband, Son, Sister etc)
individual boxed cards
packs of cards (containing different numbers, from about 6 to ‘bumper packs’)
cards with special verses
religious cards
loose cards
cards going overseas
Don't forget that customers will still want to buy ordinary greetings cards — people have birthdays at Christmas.
4
Decide where to put the gift tags, calendars and wrapping paper.
5
When you have allocated a place for all the goods, you will need showcards and name cards to go above each section (ie telling the customer where the different sections are).
6
Decide if you are going to have any special sales offers or promotions (eg selling last season's Christmas cards at a reduced price, or a promotion on wrapping paper — 10p a sheet or six sheets for 50p).
7
Will you put up Christmas decorations in the shop?
If so, what sort and where?
8
What type of poster(s) will you put in the windows?
9
What other features or promotions will you include in the campaign (eg special printed bags with a Christmas scene and the name of the shop, or ‘Merry Christmas from the Card Cabin').
Other seasonal events in the ‘promotions calendar’ include Easter, Mother's Day, St Valentine's Day and Guy Fawkes' Night.
Less specific events include the start of the new school term, summer holidays, and even the seasons themselves (special Spring Promotions, or Autumn Events).

Window display
Spot the models!
Enterprising window dressers dressed up in ski outfits to set up a display of sportswear in this store.
Like advertisements, window displays aim to attract the customers' attention and persuade them to enter the shop and buy.
When a customer buys goods ‘on impulse’ it is often because something in the window display has caught his eye.
The purposes of window display are:
to show the range of goods stocked
to promote specific items or lines
to draw passers-by into the shop
to compete with other retailers who stock similar products (by showing a wider range of goods, lower prices etc)
Window dressing is quite a specialised skill.
Big companies usually train and employ staff specifically to dress their windows.
But in smaller shops the sales staff may be asked to organise window displays.
Types of window
The way you organise goods in a display will depend on the type of window you are dressing.
There are three main types:
1
The closed back window is like a glass-fronted ‘box’— the backing completely blocks out the shop interior.
2
In the half-back window the lower half of the backing is closed in, but you can see into the shop itself through the top half.
3
The open-backed window has no backing.
The whole of the shop is visible through the window.
Display techniques
Lines
The goods in the window, and other materials used to enhance the display, should create lines which lead the eye to focus on the products.
A display without lines is less eye-catching.
Different kinds of lines have different effects:
Balance
Balance is also important if a display is to achieve the desired effect.
In a formal display the left and right hand side are exactly the same.
This is known as a symmetrical display.
An informal display uses a variety of shapes on each side.
This is sometimes known as an asymmetrical display.
Props and materials
Extra items or ‘props’ used in the display must be in proportion to the size of the goods on show.
Movement
The impression of movement in a display can be created by repeating a particular feature, shape or colour; by using a diagonal line several times, or by arranging a succession of items in order, from the smallest to the largest.
Harmony and contrast
Harmony in a display is created when colours and shapes blend together.
The overall effect is gentle and peaceful.
Contrast is the opposite of harmony — a dramatic, startling effect is achieved through the use of different lines, colours and shapes.
The following tips will help you achieve effective displays:
1
Keep similar goods together (eg radios with other radios or stereos, necklaces with other forms of jewellery).
2
Where there is sufficient space, arrange items in blocks (ie use several of the same product together).
3
Place items being promoted or featured in a prominent position in the window.
4
Keep the item(s) being featured just below average eye level.
5
In a backless window the goods should be placed at around average waist-to-shoulder height.
6
The display should not be too deep (ie should not stretch back too far from the window).
7
Use prominent and clear price tickets (but make sure they are in proportion to the size of the goods).
8
Change goods in a display regularly.
9
Keep stock in the window clean.
10
Remember the importance of line and balance.
11
Use plenty of colour, but use a theme, rather than random colours.
12 Use movement where possible.
A turntable is very useful, since it allows you to display a selection of goods.
13
Animation is particularly eye-catching (some large stores use mechanical toys or cartoon characters in window displays, especially at Christmas).
14
Good lighting is essential.
Windows lit up at night attract potential customers.

MONEY MATTERS
Introduction
If you work in retailing, it's important that you understand money.
That doesn't just mean using a cash register, giving the correct change and adding up prices, although of course these are important.
The retailer needs to be able to plan how she uses her money, to work out how much profit she needs to make to stay in business — and to grow.
Gaining an understanding of the ‘money matters’ involved in retailing will help you see how important your own part is: all the everyday transactions you perform will affect your shop's long-term financial plan.
Profit and mark up
Profit
Put very simply, the retailer's profit is the difference between the price he pays for an item (cost price) and the price he charges the customer.
So, for example, if a retailer buys 20 pairs of jeans from a wholesaler at a cost of £10 a pair (after discount, see p 114) and then charges the customer £15 a pair, he will have made £5 profit on each pair of jeans he sells.
However, that money doesn't simply go into the retailer's own pocket!
Out of his profits, the retailer has to pay all the costs involved in running the shop, that is, his overheads.
Overheads include the following:
1
rent and rates
2
staff wages
3
maintenance of the building
4
heating, lighting and telephone bills
5
advertising costs
6
security and insurance
7
cost of new stock
The profit a retailer makes before deducting these costs is called gross profit.
The amount that is left after the retailer has paid his overheads is called net profit.
The retailer wants to make his business as profitable as possible.
One obvious way to do this would be to charge high prices — so that there is a large difference between the cost price and the selling price.
But it's not so easy.
After all, the retailer only makes a profit on the items he sells: if the prices he charges are too high, the customers will go elsewhere and he won't make any profit at all!
In deciding how much profit he wants to make on each item, and how much to mark up his prices, the retailer needs to consider many of the factors we looked at in Section 7 — the socioeconomics of the area, the needs of the typical customer, the competition, and so on.
Mark up
If you buy an item at £1 and sell it for £1.50, how much percentage profit have you made?
If you said 50%, you were WRONG!
In fact you would have made 33.3% profit, since 50p is ⅓ or 33.3% of £1.50.
However, the mark-up on the item WAS 50%, since you added ½ of the original price.
MARK UP IS NOT THE SAME AS PROFIT
If the cost price of a three piece suite was £250 and you wanted to make 50% profit, you would increase (mark up) the original cost by £250 (ie 100%) to make a selling price of £500. £250 = 50% of £500.

Financial Planning
Budgeting
Budgeting is planning how we spend our money.
Whether that money is weekly pocket money, monthly wages, or the retailer's annual income, it is essential to plan how it will be spent — otherwise the result could be disaster!
If you have a job, your personal budget for a week might look something like this:
Contributing to housekeeping
Bus fares
Lunches
Records
Clothes
TOTAL £24
Your parents' budget might look something like this:
Rent or mortgage
Rates
Heating and lighting
Food
Clothes
Insurance
Household goods
Holidays
TOTAL £147
The retailer would have a different list of items of expenditure, including:
rent
wages
rates
cost of new stock
heating and lighting
advertising
insurance
maintenance
These are all described as ‘overheads’ or ‘running costs’.
Exactly what we spend our money on does not matter too much, as long as the money going out is not more than the money coming in.
Keeping a balance between income and expenditure is often referred to as ‘balancing the books’ or being ‘in the black’.
But if we spend more than we earn (ie expenditure is higher than income), then ‘the books’ don't balance and we end up in debt, or ‘in the red’.
It is essential for everyone — student, shop assistant or retail manager — to learn how to manage their money.
Another way of looking at your budget is in percentage terms.
For example, the Brown family's budget can be written down like this:
If we look at the budget on page 147 in percentage terms then it breaks down as follows:
Assignments
1
a)
Draw up your own personal budget for a typical week.
Divide up your areas of spending into general categories (eg books, sports equipment etc could all go under ‘leisure’) and list how much you spent on each one.
b)
Do your books ‘balance’— ie do you spend less than you receive each week?
c)
Now change the monetary values in your personal budget into percentages.
How do you spend the highest percentage of the total?
Pie charts
Often pictures are easier to understand than figures.
It can be very useful to present sets of figures (eg a budget) in visual form, as a pie chart or graph.
A pie chart can help the retailer or business-person see at a glance exactly where the money goes.
For example, the pie chart below was produced by the BBC.
It shows how the BBC's income from TV licence charges is spent — that is, what proportion of the whole (100%) goes to the different branches of the company.
In the same way, the retailer can divide up her income (100%) into the different areas of expenditure — and the ‘empty’ part of the chart will show her profits:
Drawing a pie chart
To draw a pie chart you first need to convert the information you want to present into percentages (as you did with your personal budget on page 148).
In the chart your total income is 100%.
A circle is made up of 360°, so each 1% of your income = 3.6° of the circle.
A pie chart for the Brown family's budget (see page 148) would look like this:
Assignments
1
a)
Draw a pie chart using the following figures:
b)
Assuming he has no other costs, what percentage profit does the retailer make?
2
Draw a pie chart for your own budget.
What do you spend the greatest proportion on?
Forecasting: line graphs
Like the pie chart (see page 149), the line graph is a way of presenting figures in visual form.
It is particularly useful for the retailer, since it enables her to see the pattern of past sales.
This helps her work out sales trends, and predict or forecast what will happen to future sales.
For example, this graph shows sales of tin openers from January to June.
The dotted line shows sales over this period last year.
The continuous line shows what the retailer hopes to sell this year.
From last year's figures, the retailer knows that she can expect sales to drop in late February, but to begin to climb again at the end of April.
This will help her calculate what quantities of tin openers to order, or to plan a promotion campaign at the beginning of February.
Shrinkage or leakage
Another item the retailer must include in his financial planning is shrinkage or leakage.
These terms are used in the retail trade to describe a loss of profit.
Profit can ‘shrink’ or ‘leak’for a number of reasons:
1
Out of-date-stock Life-dated products not sold before their expiry date may have to be sold at a lower price (or even discarded altogether).
2
Perishable items Fruit and vegetables may spoil and have to be thrown away.
3
Breakages Breakages and careless handling mean that items cannot be sold.
4
Damaged items Damaged tins or boxes are not attractive to the customer.
They often get left on the shelf, and the only way they can be sold is if the price is reduced.
5
Over-ordering If a retailer buys large quantities of a product that proves unpopular with the customer, profit will be lost.
6
Short deliveries Receiving less goods than ordered and entered on the delivery note may mean lost profit:
if the shortfall is not noticed
if stock runs out before new supplies can be obtained
7
Shoplifters Thefts account for a large proportion of lost profits.
Goods worth a billion pounds are stolen each year.
8
Dishonest staff Members of staff may steal money or goods themselves, or collude (make a deal) with members of the public to help them steal.
9
Staff error Giving too much change, or guessing prices rather than checking up can reduce profits
10
Accounting errors Of course, the retailer will do all he can to limit the amount of shrinkage, but he will probably allow for a small percentage loss of profit when working out his budget.
This varies from about 2.5% to around 10%.
Assignments
1
Choose a product sold in the shop where you work/have worked.
Ask the manager to give you the sales figures for that product over a six-month period, and then find out what the expected sales are for the coming year.

2
Find out the sales figures for a particular item over a period of five years.
Draw a line graph for the five years and say which year had the highest sales.
3
A retailer spends 40% of his income on new stock, 10% on rent, 23% on wages, 10% on lighting and heating and 7% on other miscellaneous items.

VAT
The initials VAT stand for Value Added Tax.
This is a levy or tax charged on many of the goods we buy.
Most manufactured items (eg watches, garden equipment, calculators) carry VAT; the most notable exceptions are food products and children's clothes.
VAT is also charged on services: if, for example, you employ a plumber to repair a blocked sink, part of the bill would be VAT; or if you bought a hot pie in a cafe (instead of a cold one in a supermarket) you would have to pay VAT.
The standard rate of VAT is 15%.
The easiest way to calculate VAT is to find out what 10% of the cost of an item would be, then halve that (to find what 5% would be) and add the two together.
So, for example, if an item cost £1 before VAT.
10 % of £1 = 10p
Half of 10p = 5p
10p + 5p =15p
You would have to pay an extra 15p on the price of the item.
So the overall charge would be £1.15.
VAT is an indirect form of taxation (unlike, for example, income tax, which is taken directly from a person's wages).
You pay it only if you buy the goods.
Businesses which earn more than £400 a week must become VAT registered.
The retailer must pay VAT to the Government's Customs and Excise Department every three months.
If he attempts to avoid paying, he may be fined or imprisoned.

Everyday transactions
All sorts of small items are needed for the day-to-day running of any shop or office, eg postage stamps, pens, envelopes.
These items are usually paid for out of the petty cash.
If you work in retailing, you may be asked to look after the petty cash.
Petty cash systems vary in different businesses, but the procedure will probably be something like this:
1
The cash box or tin is kept in a locked drawer or safe.
2
A float or imprest (say £20) is kept in the tin to pay for everyday items.
This may be renewed at regular intervals, or when the person responsible points out that it is getting low.
3
An everyday item (eg batteries for a calculator) needs to be replaced.
4
You buy the batteries and get a receipt for the amount you paid (£2.06).
5
You take £2.06 from the cash box and fill in a cash voucher with the amount and details of the item purchased.
6
You attach your receipt to the cash voucher and place them in the cash box.
7
You fill in the petty cash book with details of the purchase.
How to complete the petty cash book
This is what your entry in the petty cash book should look like:
Each item has been entered twice: once under TOTAL PAID and once under its own special heading (this is known as the analysis column).
The analysis columns have the following headings:
Travel
This column is for bus fares and taxi fares spent on journeys for the firm.
Wages
This covers people paid on a one-off or casual basis, eg window-cleaners.
Cleaning
This section includes cleaners' wages and cleaning materials (eg dusters, polish).
Stationery or Office expenses
This covers pens, paper, drawing pins, sellotape…
There may be a separate column for postage — if not, stamps usually come under this heading.
Miscellaneous
Anything that doesn't fit under another heading may be entered here, eg tea, biscuits, soap.
Each analysis column is totalled separately.
All the analysis columns totalled together should agree with the figure in the TOTAL PAID column.
The balance of petty cash is the difference between the total paid and the amount originally in the cash box (either the amount in the float, or the amount left after previous purchases).
The sum of money needed to restore the balance to the original amount is known as the imprest.
So, for example,You began the day with £20 in the cash box.
You spent £2.06 on batteries, and £1.71 on nine 19p stamps, so the TOTAL PAID was £3.77.
The imprest would also be £3.77, so that the petty cash box contains £20 for the next day.
The balance is written underneath the TOTAL PAID on the petty cash sheet, and the amount of imprest is entered under that.
The petty cash sheet is then ready for another lot of entries.
At the end of each week or each month the retailer (or the accounts department, in a big firm) totals up the petty cash paid for that period.
This gives the retailer a clear picture of how much is being spent, and on what.
If the weekly total is much bigger than normal, the retailer will want to know why.
Handling the petty cash is a responsible job, it's important that you always follow the correct procedure, fill in the cash book carefully and always check your calculations.
