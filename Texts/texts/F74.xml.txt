It might be a good guess today if I could say that most people either done as much as they could with their model  and had this
erm
finished, so I asked if they would help me to sort out the erm
they nearly did it  brilliant way, remember I had the little labels on them  and they've all got mixed up one way or another
so we're here to
scrap through the remains of erm and got the wire wool and got them down and washed them, what I would like today if you would be so kind as to assist when you've finished your pottery is to re-label these, now some of you er, have already finished pottery and start straight away, those who only have the finishing touches to do, start half way through the lesson or whatever, but I do intend to give a demonstration now, so, could you gather all round
you must know where all the
erm if you take a
and take a
to your desk 
and then 
the trouble with
is about three
speed of knots going on this flight here I
put them on your desk and then arrange them in the order that you know I approve.
Can anybody remember offhand?
So it goes, yellow, yellow ochre  erm scarlet red, crimson, that's the dark red, light green, dark green erm, sky blue, indigo  purple, brown and black a lot of people get mixed up
 

I like you
that I realize is very
so can you see that board there?
That's just
 

erm
Er Emma keep thy hands to thy self otherwise that the eye can induce the old custom of putting them off 
The
goes streamingly across there like that  put as much glue on the back as you can so that they're really well anchored down, leave the  so the outside edge of the square level with the
lining, so they're not all skew-whiff.
When you come to doing along on the other side make sure they're beautiful parallel
does that make sense to everybody?
So that's a beautiful block, now  did I explain to you lot yesterday about er, that was yesterday sorry
about er collage or pottery
No
No, sorry about that, right, now  one should keep
they would like to paint their pottery, the fact is if you initially don't paint your pottery with normal paints you paint your pottery with erm oxides which fire well, I'll explain that to you once the er, as the
comes through, so if you just wait I'll talk to you again a little bit about that 
If you go into the top cupboard, there's a shelf marked
and
right I'll take
through, er, ah  put the
a chemical term er
difficult question, but you might be able to give me an example of one  aha
Okay, that does have oxygen in it, yes, I don't think it's
I think you're wrong, not being a specialist
can anybody else give me an example of an oxide with
that is a metal, but it's not erm an oxide metal
nearly all metals have oxides  and those powderless substances on the surface of the
which is scraped off and used as so called paint for the pottery, mixed with a little light
which is burnt off when the whole thing gets fired in the kiln, so what will have to happen is the, your pots you've done so far, once they're thoroughly dried and go into the kiln, they're fired at a high temperature and then they'll come out this bit fired you'll then separate them with oxide pastes, dip them into glaze, which I'll explain in a minute, and re-fire them at a higher temperature, the glazed would
in the heat, once it's cooled down you'll get the familiar appearance of a glossy surface of pottery, with the oxide having also fired and sometimes changed colour and that's your colour underneath, on your base a layer of colour and then a plastic surface  right if I talk about glaze, erm vitrify does, did anybody understand that?
Have you heard the term before?
You've heard of glazed before yeah
er I don't
 

Mr  sir, have you heard the term glazed?
Makes it shiny, yes, what is it that is shiny?
Specifically
The surface
The surface, do you know what it's made out of?
It's very similar in word
Polish
It's not polish, it's glass, if you look at the windows, they are familiar glass aren't they?
Well actually pottery is covered in a thin layer of glass, so that when your pot is dipped into the glazed solution, it's simply a suspension of silicone in water  which ride on the surface, to leave a powder, which is really finely ground up sand, when you put that into the kiln to fire at a higher temperature it mystifies it, it turns into glass, now it's
in its simplest form.
I'll have, have to do that later for you because you won't be doing it then, this lesson next year, and if your pots don't go up in the kiln I will be glazing for you, so of course you see the colour and everything we don't have the time to do that, it's a shame, well actually they'll look very smart just with the glaze on, but I'll try and get that done for you, okay, can you put your hand up if there is
you need to do today
you
okay, will you people very carefully go and
