Very clear
At the north of Italy, sixty percent of the co , of the lands north of Italy full exist, so look, what, look.
Come to me, look I'm having trouble.
tried.
you know that?
Country traditions are shown at the diagram, in North Italy erm, there's more land than south  in the diagram.
Sixty percent of the land is in North Italy, and forty percent is in the south.
Population though, sixty one percent live in the North, thirty eight percent live in the south.
People employed in industry which as you know today is er, a, an indication of how a rich a country is.
Twenty seven in the south, thirty nine percent in the north.
 
How much electricity people use
only
There just might be two  the direction of that , what are we going to do about your hive problems?
Much more in the north, one hundred kilowatts per, per head, and in the north itself is well under , cars, motorcycles, again in the north, much more lot of er, cars, and in the consumption of, of food 
Petrol consumption,
What?
Petrol consumption.
Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble,
again, people consume more food.
Now all those show, all those indications show that the north is much richer.
I'll be able to draw the little picture.
yes, what we need to do is this.
In the middle I want you to draw a picture of each item, and then, the land population , industry, and why  food production, Sam you're not listening.
oh, it's h , hard doing Geography Can we work in pairs?
You're free to draw a picture and diagram and then
Better call, better call  composition.
Mm?
You can, you can design any kind of picture to illustrate the land in whatever  
Well whippy do 
Actually most  is either hills or mountains, if you look actually you can draw a picture of a hill or a mountain, but most, most of the land  er hills or mountains which is very interesting isn't it?

No-o-o ooh, ooh,
Shut up
Sorry No, bulimia, where you eat anything, and you puke it up all up,
You eat, and eat and eat, and then you throw it all up.
So you have a bilge, and, you eat loads of cakes and then instead of like you with pizzas down there, they just throw it up 
Yes, as well, binge, binge, not bilge 
Yes, binge, they put it with it to stay skinny 
Bilge, I'm still having a bilge 
Oh, what a sucking  somebody left a bite mark from where they were 
Ah
I was saying this morning, in fact it was on This Morning, or Good Morning, or
Hey, I'm bulimic
Anne and Nick I think
What?
Anne and Nick type problems.
Yes, they were  they were saying about 
 
Shush, let her talk.
They were saying about  they keep asking her because she could be like page three models in the newspaper, she was like very  even this really  and then she just said I keep on going toilet and she'd, she'd then puke up in the toilet and she'd come back and there were all these bite marks so her parents could see when she was doing it.
Anne and Nick are really shit, Anne and Nick are really shit, la, la, la, la, la 
Oh, what happened?
Oh, nothing, but she, you could see the way she had, her whole hand up from here in, you could see she had bite marks

You go,
I'll make you sick.
How do you do it?
I said how did she do it, did she, did Jane ever do it?
What?
I don't know if she did.
Well what's she talking it about it for then?
I don't think Jane's bulimic.
Why was she just talking about it?
We've got to be quiet though, she might be a bit touchy?
Millie, why was she just talking about it?
Because she's saying that she can't make herself sick.
She can't?
No.
Can I borrow a pencil please 
I can't, I hate being sick, I can never make myself sick.
They were taking her tonsils out or something.

Really.
Sir,
sir, we're trying to 
Sir
I was eating my, I was eating my supper when he started  
 
Erm, d'you have to do a picture for the north and south of it, or just one overall picture?
I don't understand, I don't understand, I don't understand 
Yes, this one here, it should be one overall, it should be just one overall picture of the item like the land, and this shows the different proportions of land in the north and south.
Of if you want to separate the picture into two, you could draw a picture representing the land in the south and the land in the north.
It's up to you really, how you do it.
I'll just do one picture.
One picture's fine.
One picture of what?
Land?
Yes, just to illustrate.
This is the item,
Yes.
You draw a picture representing the land,
How can you draw a picture representing land?
Just draw a mountain and a river 
Well if you were listening , you see, I said, most land in Italy is mountains and hills, so you could draw some hills and mountains, that'd be really good.
So, Sir, shall I tell you how, you know people  when you talk, or we're not supposed to talk.
Sorry
Is that like on the board, talking, when you're talking it's really rude.
I wish you, you should ask them to read out, read out the O M because then people become more involved in that.
