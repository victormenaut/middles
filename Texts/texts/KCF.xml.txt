Do you wanna dance all through the night?
La de day de day de tonight oh baby do you wanna dance?
Yeah he  from the committee.
You wanna watch out or he'll be having you down at the .
Stuart'll be having you as his star turn.
Where's your dad gone?
Mm?
Where's your dad gone?
Eh?
Oh .
She's acting stupid you know.
Are we gonna have a listen to Coronation Street?
Oh  are you trying to shove me mother out again Herbert?
Every time you walk in she 
Well 
walks out.
well we can all go and listen to Coronation Street.
Alright!
Well you, cos you haven't seen it have you Alison?
You didn't er that  did you?
Yeah but I'm saying they're not paying  they haven't gotta pay for that machine.
Who hasn't gotta pay for the machine?
Well if they're doing, somebody by hand's doing it, they haven't got that  of paying for that machine.
Yeah but  the machine could do what a hundred people could do in a day, can't it?
The machine doesn't get tired like people do.
Yeah but I mean
The peo the machine only goes off bad if somebody hasn't been maintaining it.
And all you've gotta do is, with machine is put petrol or diesel or whatever it is to make  and check all the oil 
And  
I know  but  that offsets  the labour is the, labour is the thing that costs a fortune.
Yeah.
Well why don't you do it all before  and  
Well they do.
and they've got it in but  it wants it at different times doesn't it?
So you can't give it fertiliser.
Well I still think that  well say you have a big massive thing and, and say it'd take  a hundred people  mm er I suppose the bigger it is the more economical it is.
But if you only had a small place it'd be more economical to have labour than it would to buy  paying out thousands of pounds for machines and 
No you don't buy the, they come round and do it for you don't they?
Well alright then  
You hire it for a day  or whatever it is.
It costs  just say for instance two hundred pounds for the tractor and, and his sprayer  and er the chemicals on top.
That's done your whole field  big field.
Now that two hundred pound will only pay one man for a  for a week  to do the same thing.
And he's gotta do it a few times, so then the cost becomes  and, and you  like let's be fair, we've had summers where it's  the weeds er the weeds haven't grown, but you get a wet summer  and the weather warms and the wet and the weeds go  peooow up like that.
So that's, and then it doesn't  stops 
Well alright then, why can't he put bark on it ?
Well that, it costs.
from everywhere.
Do it that way.
But it's still costs isn't it?
Well then if you put a lot of bark on it  and with vegetables, so they want  fertilizer 
Well  
 
You don't know what I am.
I do I couldn't care less what you are Iris 
Did you know  seven days?
In where?
In .
Oh aye, yeah.
Yeah.
And do you know what, if th if they don't vote, if you don't vote what you always have done .
I know.
That's why  .
Yeah but if you have a secret vote how do they know what you voted for?
They don't know.
I know you have.
If you  come round and 
Well that's generations isn't it?
But how many youngsters take  take any notice of what their mam and dad says?
Yeah but who, what  ?
He's had,offer offered to stand down  if he can get a younger person that will run it.
Put Sammy in.
But that, I mean  he's offered to stand down.
It's getting a bit of a nuisance to him  stuck there for twenty seven years.
Well he lives the life of luxury.
It's not a nuisance  going off for his weekend break in the .
No I mean  weekend out there.
Oh me mam's back again now.
I'll get you sorted out mum.
Between ?
Yeah by the  airport, yeah.
And he has them cows and all that there, them  that was 
Well I'll get you through with it then I can sort the tea out.
Do you want  now?
Yeah and then Herbert and Alison won't be long.
Where did we go on a Sunday and we passed there?
And we, all them motorbikes was on er the edge.
Yeah.
That's where it is, aye.
Yeah, well we 
the fish and everything's on.
Yes but I thought his was the what's name there.
It's the church there, there's some special church on his ground.
Cos they was waiting to take it back weren't they?
Yeah well he, he said that  he goes there   he can grow his vegetables then.
Well he's 
Is your arm getting better now?
You what love?
Getting better now?
Aye getting better now.
Chris'll be off on Wednesday.
I can move me arm about and do me exercises and  couple of weeks I'll be getting fighting fit.
now, well you know where we're up to.
You know what's 
Well I  .
Oh alright then, so if John Major gets elected then I'll still 
Yeah.
No because you're paying extra thirty five pence for 
Alright then, so I'm gonna have one pound sixty five a week?
Yeah.
Providing you don't put any petrol in your vehicle.
And you don't do any drinking.
Fine, so you've got that.
That, that'll suit me.
I, I won't put no petrol in the vehicle then and I won't do no drinking.
Okay?
Course
Stuart's going to be one thirty five down.
And even more when he gets his car back on the road, so
He's not putting his car back on the road.
I don't know why he isn't.
put his car back on the road.
.
But I think once they've gone off the road now it's  gonna be  gonna be worse  when the, when the engine stops ?
When you take anything off the road   left it a couple of days without running it, even on a Sunday, it'd be a harder to get it back going again on Monday.
Well the thing is if he can get four hundred quid why doesn't he get one of them new bikes that Sinclair's brought out?
Well, they run for an hour on a battery  without pedalling, three hours if you pedal.
It's a bike  it's electric.
It's a battery.
It's a bike and you go  like that to get it going and then you, it rides along.
Isn't it?
I've no idea.
I've not even  
four hundred and odd pounds.
Oh that's not bad is it?
Cos you can pay that for a blooming mountain bike.
Yeah.
And it'll run for an hour  without pedalling.
If you pedal you can get as much as three hours.
A penny  it costs a penny to recharge it, it recharges in an hour.
So if you go
No but if you go from here to work isn't it?
Plug it in  in the what's name, pull lead off it and plug it in  and then it'll
a penny, say here's a penny.
And then he's ready to come back home again isn't he?
Plug it in here  give your mam a penny.
Er  give him a penny  
That's what it is.
Rechargeable battery.
Well say I moved and lived in Gambia.
I'd be able vote there would I?
No.
You've gotta be a resident of there.
If I lived there I mean  and bought a house.
Well no, not necessary.
You're classed as a foreigner.
As an Englishman.
So all these Pakistanis and  they can't vote?
They're re once  no.
If they  but they come to live here don't they?
Well that's what I mean, if I went to live in Gambia.
And I bought a house 
Ah but you've got a British passport.
You're not a resident of Gambia.
You're a British 
they don't know.
And you can vote loads of times there.
You're not on a register.
They put a stamp on you.
Stamp on where?
On your hand.
Well it must be able to wash off.
Well aye  
And you don't have to be twenty one either.
You don't have to here, it's only eighteen here.
No but  twenty one aren't you?
You've got to be twenty one to vote there but if you're, you're eighteen and you go in and somebody else says you're twenty one you can vote.
The  why the Pakistanis can vote in this country  they've got a British passport.
No but I mean  there are people that come in here  and just living here.
Yeah the Pakistanis!
They've got British passports!
This is what all the trouble's about, they've all got British passports.
Well why are they allowed to have a British passport?
the empire we allowed them to have British passports didn't we?
They can get them because they are British.
Pakistan's British?
Well it was, it was in the empire.
It's in the commonwealth isn't it?
And Indians and all this.
And this is why we're trying to stop them coming in.
There's ten thousand a week coming in.
Every week?
They're coming in from everywhere.
And this is what the, the  what's name now  that when it's opened in nineteen ninety two  the communist block will be able to come through Germany this way in.
Straight into this country.
And be doing all our  they will be gonna come and do all the jobs that we don't want like in, in  catering and, and things like that.
All the rough jobs.
They get in here  then they bring their families and then they're gonna  fill the country up aren't they?
It's only a little tiny country.
The Conservatives are trying to stop it.
Th they're trying to get it through, the bill through.
And Labour won't stop them?
No, Labour will allow them in.
Course, what you've got to think of, Conservatives are the one that started it in the first place.
So they've gotta try and kill it off now.
But the Labour won't.
But they didn't start it.
Some things are very complicated  Alison.
You've got to  thingybob all through everything.
Anything else you wanna know?
I think what I'll do is erm  when    totally confused about  what they're gonna do and  who's gonna be what and 
Well you've got to weigh up that and you've got to read the manifesto  when it comes out.
What they're going to do for you.
Yes but they don't put it in words like you put, they put it in blooming complicated language, but tell lies.
Don't, read between the lines.
See me and your mum'll know that.
We'll read between the lines.
Me and your mother not your mother and I.
It's me and your mother.
Well that was,the other day?told him about that.
What?
You put Alison, Stuart and me  Stuart, Alison and I.
He went oh is it?
Well what did he give it you to read for?
He was writing it, he was just sitting there.
Oh aye.
I wasn't gonna get one was I, no?
Yeah.
Well he suggested it.
He was sitting and he said oh I'll write Iris a few lines.
But he said 
?
Yeah he said, but the girl that was with him said that you were very highly honoured to have a letter that length cos usually she gets  dear  oh I  her name's  what her  but dear whoever, got loads to tell you, love Mario.
That's all she gets every time she gets a letter .
So she said you're highly honoured to have a letter that long.
She's never seen one that long .
O over this election, what you've gotta do is every night, is  if you're interested  is watch it for the first quarter of an hour of the news every night.
And you will pick up so much then to what's going on.
Yeah but they tell lies!
I know but
They're not gonna tell me if you vote, if you  if you vote for me I'm gonna  cut your wages and he, he's not gonna tell me
No.
vote for me, I'm gonna cut your wages.
Neil Kinnock will tell you what the Conservatives aren't gonna do.
Yeah.
So  John Major will tell you 
Will tell me what 
they're gonna do.
And, and  and Paddy Ashdown'll tell you what the other two aren't gonna do.
They don't tell you what they're gonna do, they just tell you what the other ones aren't gonna do .
Yeah.
Which doesn't mean that they're gonna do it does it?
Well no 
It just means that they're not gonna do it .
Yeah.
And they're all gonna tell lies and it's gonna be  the dirtiest election that there's ever been, this.
There can't be a dirtier one than this because they've started already.
Do they're all gonna tell lies.
And they're gonna tell lies and it's gonna be a dirty lies.
So it's not  .
So you're not gonna pick up anything .
It's going to be the dirtiest election.
They're going to mu throw mud at everybody.
Everybody's going to be what's named and this that and the other.
Glenys will be what's named running up and down the wall.
They're going to,th they have a go at her don't they, Glenys?
And Neil, let's be fair  
I mean they have a go at all of them.
it's not gonna be right for somebody isn't it?
I think if god come back down and  to be prime minister he's not gonna be right for everybody is he?
Oh .
They was on about this    and er  they was on about that.
That was a thing that come on and they said  now when if  when god was here and he did a miracle of the loaves and the fishes  somebody would turn round and say there was no salt and vinegar.
and then   and then he said when he turned the wine, they would say well we wanted white wine not red wine.
Well it is true though isn't it?
Whoever it, whoever it is it's not gonna be right for everybody.
Oh god!
But it, that was on here.
Because he was  doing complaining and all that then this, this one  er Roger said that.
wouldn't be any salt and vinegar.
Or somebody would have said well we wanted brown bread, not white bread .

In the lounge.

I thought it was one of them.
It means it's inside, ours is outside.
Oh I thought it was one of them fifty pence ones.
Well what difference does it make?
Well I thought it'd be better if
I don't understand the double panelled radiators not presently connected.
I don't know what it means  whether it's electric or  wait a minute there's some more.
Did you knock on that door?
There's nobody living there.
Oh that's funny.
I think they might have split up.
Well that's what's happening all the while isn't it?
I liked that one though.
Yeah well you'll not get it much less than that.
It's a  a bigger, but I think again  you're walking straight into the lounge I think.
I'm not sure.
You are.
Are you?
Yeah.
And your stairs going up .
Just a minute.
No, the dining room.
You put your  staircase into the dining room.
Says here.
Oh, so your lounge is at the back?
I don't know, to be honest.
It seems a bit funny for me cos I'd have thought the kitchen was at the back so then you'd have your dining room then .
Yeah but people don't always want  like that.
Yeah but  
Cos your Auntie Dorothy has her dining room in the front.
And the lounge at the back doesn't she?
Or she did do.
Now she's got it the other way about

Oh!bum bum bum .

Been empty too long.
Like that one's been empty too long.
There's a lot of work!
The skirting boards and everythi ,put that one round the corner!
You're better off with something like this.
Mm.
Ten.
Be living in!
Mm.
That's er  well that's, one occupied.
They've been occupied, that one isn't is it?
This i , this one here..

Swept heads and leaded light features.
Mm.
Open plan staircase leads to first floor.
So you've got the stairca , have you been in one of them?
Yeah.
What they like?
Same as that one down there.
But you go from the stairs and in the er
You've got a kitchen diner.
You've 
These 
got er  a what's a name on the wall like that.
Yeah.
The thing is you
High panelled ceiling.
I think you're better loo , looking in one that's all furnished out and that, cos I can't imagine that with furniture in.
Bedroom two is a five foot eight inches.
Yeah.
So that's  one me.
They've got this left for me.
Yeah.
Twenty four.
That's, that'll  price on that one.
Yeah.
Couple of inches on there  you could
You've gotta beat them!
But it's a house.
Can you ge can you put that er  anything up the side?
We are 
 
it's the end of  row that is there 
That is, yeah.
so there's bound to be 
Right.
some space there!
I know, it says garden to side..
Well you can run what you like up your garden can't you?
Mhm.
Well they the new ones on the  front  would they do that?
Brand new, brand new one.
Same as that.
They're still building.
I think this is why they can't sell cos they keep building on and people are going in the newer ones and not buying the ones that are lived in.
And it's all  all  
Well you don't want a big roaring place do you?
Oh heck, no!
I mean, you're not gonna  fill it with children are you?
Gonna fill it with little puppies!
The smaller the better!
I mean, I wish I had a small place.
And Kimmy wants to come and visit don't you?
And you'll have this garden to run about in won't you?
A big garden!
I mean, we got a dining room that we use about three times a year!
Oh I'm not bothered about things like that, but I would have liked  a decent size garden.
That one that that bloke had in Wrexham, he'd got a go , good one there!
Little bungalow.
And like then, like dad said if you've got a decent sized garden at the back  if you wanna extend  you can put an extension on the back can't you?
You can't extend on there.
No, cos it's a  one.
It all depends what you're looking for Alison.
You've just gotta make your mind up.
Yeah but the thing is, it's something that we've got to  think for life really, or we're just gonna be in the same situation in  a couple of years that we wanna  something a bit bigger.
That's right.
Won't we?
I mean, we could be in a predicament that we've got to stay in there cos nobody will buy it!
So how many houses are up for sale now?
Prices are gonna come down aren't they?
Yeah.
But I said that  and sort of just holding on a level now like, isn't it?
Yeah, but I mean
But erm  but there's a lot  trying to be sold like, isn't there?
As you say  they've gotta come down and probably  we'll have to talk to them.
To get, you know  get the sales.
The thing is if you're getting one that's lived in  you're most likely to get the carpets and things like that in.
Yeah.
I mean like this.
A brand new one you've got to fit haven't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
And even if you buy a cheap carpet to start with it's not gonna last long as i ,i ,i 
No, no.
you know you've gotta yo , you're talking a thousand for carpets!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not many people that's lived in a house take the carpets cos they won't fit wherever else they're going.
No, well that's it, they just
Especially if it's smaller ones cos they're probably moving onto a bigger house.
Yeah.
I don't know what you wanna big roaming house for?
I don't want a big roaming house, but I want  a decent sized house  and  with a bit of garden!
I'm not asking for much mother!
Are we?
It's what you live in I think.
I mean, you're not gonna be  it's not as though you're gonna be having people staying or  erm  I mean if you're gonna get a little place with a little single bed in 
Can't invite people .
you can't invite people to stay.
Can you?
 Nope!
It's  I know, it's a place of your own, it's your own and it's not a big place to keep  clean is it?
I mean, the more space you have, the more muck you'll make!
I know.
And also it'll  the  bound to be  building and that  it'll, you watch them .
You're right.
Yeah.
They'll each go up with .
Doesn't give the rateable value on 
No.
any of them.

Carpets and things like that 
 
if you're going for a big 
 Ey.
place.

That's a .
You'd have to  leave them with
And in the same  you know, I mean er  two or three years so there's not gonna be much, and it's only been a couple that are gonna 
 
look after it aren't they?
Yeah.
You see, these up here's been up a long time.
