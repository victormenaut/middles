Introduction
This book is not intended to be an authoritative textbook.
There are several erudite and comprehensive books available to guide the unwary through the maze that has been constructed over the centuries to form our current property law and which seems to be continually evolving.
Three of these works are particularly worth mentioning: Drafting and Negotiating Commercial Leases by Murray J Ross (Butterworths), Drafting Business Leases by Kim Lewison (Longman) and Commercial Leases by Stephen Tromans (Sweet & Maxwell).
All of these have assisted me in compiling this book.
The object of this book is to act as a guide to commercial conveyancers when amending and settling agreements for lease and leases.
These documents appear to be expanding in length daily, but the principal provisions tend to remain constant, and it is because of this that I have felt able to expound a series of amendments which I believe a commercial conveyancer should have in mind in considering the draft documentation.
In compiling this book I am extremely grateful to Butterworth & Co Ltd for allowing me to reproduce precedents and text from Volume 22 of the Encyclopaedia of Forms & Precedents (5th edn).
I thought it essential to set out a full precedent for both the agreement and lease, so that readers could see the complete documentation and how I propose to amend it.
After a certain amount of deliberation, I decided to use Form 14 from Volume 22 of the Encyclopaedia for the agreement and Form 29 for the lease.
I have always been impressed with the quality of the precedents contained in the Encyclopaedia, which rarely let us down, despite the intricacies of the subject matter, and it comes as no surprise to me to find that so many firms seem to be basing their standard form agreements and leases on Forms 14 and 29.
All references to "the Encylopaedia" and "the precedent" in the text refer to the Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents.
My amendments are not designed to cover every eventuality, which of course would be a practical impossibility, but are aimed at the provisions that tend to be common to most agreements and leases.
Provisions are, however, phrased differently from lease to lease and the tenant's adviser will be expected to construe and amend the particular documentation accordingly, but perhaps considering the guidelines I have laid down.
Furthermore, there will naturally be many covenants and other provisions additional to those contained in the precedents, but the tenant's adviser will have to continue to tackle those himself, using his own judgment.
I have spent quite some time considering the best format for the book and, after much deliberation, have decided to set out in bold type the precedents clause by clause interspersed with my own comments, followed, once again in bold type, by my suggested amendments to the particular parts of the precedents, where those amendments are not readily identifiable from my comments in the text.
I have also tried to divide the particular provisions of the precedents into chapters, where appropriate, but I feel that the agreement does not lend itself to such a division, and I have therefore dealt with that in a chapter by itself.
It must also be appreciated that the amendments suggested in this book represent my opinion as to what is advisable in the tenant's best interests.
I offer no warranty that they are conclusive and, if accepted by the landlord, produce ideal documentation from the tenant's standpoint.
It may be that other commercial conveyancers would amend the documentation differently to me, or even disagree either with my amendments or my reasoning, and if so, I should be interested to hear from them.
Finally, I should like to express my gratitude to my partner, John Stacey, a lawyer of considerable intellect who, while bearing no responsibility for the contents of this work, first introduced me to commercial conveyancing and has since played no little part in my continuing education in the subject.

Agreement for Lease
Introduction
In many instances, there is no necessity for an agreement for lease.
For instance, a tenant may have agreed to take a lease from a landlord of premises which are free standing and are ready for immediate occupation by the tenant.
In such circumstances, the lease and its counterpart can be exchanged immediately they have been settled by the parties' advisers, and any works to be carried out by the tenant can be dealt with in a licence for alterations.
Where, however, there are conditions precedent to a lease being granted, eg the fact that the premises have not yet been constructed by the landlord, or the tenant is to carry out works before the lease is granted, or there is some other reason preventing the immediate completion of the lease, the parties will, or would be advised to, enter into an agreement for lease, perhaps along the following lines.
Where either party is a company it is advisable to insert its registered office as its address as this is unlikely to alter regularly.
The insertion of a company registration number aids identification, eg for company search purposes, and is unobjectionable.
AN AGREEMENT…(parties and commencement)
1 Definitions and Interpretation
1.1 "the Landlord" includes the successors in title of the Landlord to the Site and any other person who is at any time entitled to the reversion immediately expectant on the term agreed to be granted by this agreement
1.2 "the Tenant" does not include any successors in title of the Tenant  Unless the agreement provides otherwise, privity of contract will ensure that the original parties remain in a contractual relationship inter se to the extent of their obligations under the agreement.
The landlord may, however, assign its reversion and there is no objection to clause 1.1 as drafted.
In fact the definition will also include persons entitled to intermediate leasehold interests where created by the landlord between the date of the agreement and the grant of the lease.
Clause 1.2 is not acceptable as it is inadvisable to agree any unreasonable fetters on the tenant's right to assign the benefit of the agreement.
There may for some reason be a substantial delay between the date of the agreement and the grant of the lease during which time the tenant may wish to assign its interest in it.
The clause should therefore be amended to read: "the Tenant" includes the successors in title of the Tenant A landlord may nevertheless for the purpose of privity of contract wish to ensure that the person with whom it is entering into the agreement will be the original tenant under the lease.
The tenant should avoid such an obligation.
1.3 "the Site" means the [building and adjoining]Premises described in the First Schedule The "site" may be merely the site upon which the premises are to be constructed or may comprise the whole of the landlord's development.
If the latter, the tenant should ensure that the landlord completes all works necessary to finish the development.
A partially built shopping centre, for instance, will adversely affect the tenant's business.
1.4 "Works" means the works [of alteration and refurbishment]which are being carried out on and to the Site by the Landlord and which are to be completed by the Landlord in accordance with clause 2 of this agreement The (landlord's) works can be the alteration and refurbishment of an existing building or can be the actual building of new premises or an entire development such as a shopping centre.
1.5 "Tenant's Works" means the works which are to be carried out and completed by the Tenant on the Premises in accordance with clause 3 of this agreement consisting of:
[1.5.1 the installation and fitting of a shop front
1.5.2 the provision of floor covering and 
1.5.3 such other fitting out works as the Tenant shall [reasonably]require]The tenant's works may of course be far more extensive and the above works are given by way of illustration only.
Care should be taken to ensure that the tenant's works are not carried out under an obligation to the landlord or the tenant could be disadvantaged on rent review.
1.6 "the Premises" means the part of the Site described in the Second Schedule together with such of the Works and the Tenant's Works as may from time to time have been carried out on the Premises This describes the premises which are to be demised to the tenant and which will include the tenant's works and possibly also the landlord's works where alterations or refurbishment works have been carried out to the premises by the landlord.
1.7 "Building Contract" means a contract for the carrying out of the Works made the day of between (1) the Landlord as employer and (2)(name) of (address) as contractor
1.8 "Architect" means (name) of (address) or such other person as the Landlord may from time to time appoint to perform the functions of the architect under the Building Contract and notify to the Tenant as having been so appointed It may be that the landlord will entrust supervisory functions to a surveyor or some other suitably qualified person.
There is no objection to this but the tenant should ensure that the person so appointed is suitably qualified to enable him to carry out his functions in a proper and responsible manner.
1.9 "Certificate" means a certificate by the Architect to the effect that in the opinion of the Architect Practical Completion of the Landlord's Works has been achieved and "Practical Completion" shall for the purposes of this agreement have the same meaning as in the Building Contract) The "opinion of the Architect" should be qualified to read "the reasonable opinion of the Architect" , but it should be noted that  practical completion can be certified even when some works under the building contract are still outstanding.
All that is required is that sufficient of the works shall have been completed to enable the premises to be used for the purpose intended, and if the tenant has any particular concerns as to the completion of the works then it should ensure that express provision is made for those concerns in the agreement (see clause 2.8).
1.10 "Certificate of Practical Completion" means the Certificate issued by the Architect pursuant to clause of the Building Contract
1.11 "Certificate Date" means the date on which the Certificate of Practical Completion is issued
1.12 "Term Commencement Date" means:
1.12.1 (if the Certificate Date falls on a usual quarter day) the Certificate Date and
1.12.2 (in any other case) the usual quarter day immediately preceding the Certificate Date Landlords often insist that for management purposes the term of the lease should begin on a quarter day, particularly where the premises are part of a large development.
This should be resisted by the tenant as not only will the term be slightly diminished (by almost three months where, for instance, the certificate date is a few days before a quarter day) which could be relevant for a comparatively short term lease, but also the first and subsequent rent review dates will be that much sooner, which at a rent of, say, £100,000 per year, increasing to £140,000 per year (in an inflationary market) on the first rent review, would add £10,000 per quarter to the rent.
This clause should therefore be amended to read:
1.12 "Term Commencement Date" means the Certificate Date
1.13 "Lease" means a Lease of the Premises for a term of years commencing on the Term Commencement Date reserving [a or an initial]rent of £ (pounds) per year such Lease to be in the form of the draft Lease annexed and initialled by or on behalf of the parties with such modifications as may from time to time be agreed in writing by or on behalf of the parties or as may be made pursuant to clause 4 of this agreement
1.14 "Working day" means any day on which clearing banks in the City of London are (or would be but for a strike lock-out  or other stoppage affecting such banks generally) open during banking hours and "working days" shall be construed accordingly
1.15 "Completion date" means whichever is the latest of:
1.15.1 the date falling [20]working days after the Certificate Date and
1.15.2 the date falling [5]working days after the date on which the Architect issues a Tenant's Certificate pursuant to clause 3.9 of this agreement and
1.15.3 (if applicable) the date falling [10]working days after the Landlord receives notification in accordance with clause 4.2.5 of this agreement It is better to err on the side of caution when agreeing time periods for the completion of the lease.
There will be pre-completion searches to put in hand and in addition some corporate tenants in particular may require a few days in order to execute and return documentation.
As such the time periods in 1.15.2 and 1.15.3 seem a little tight.
1.16 "Possession date" means the date on which the Architect serves on the Tenant a notice in accordance with clause 3.2 of this agreement
1.17 "Rent Commencement Date" means the date falling after the Possession Date This provides for the tenant to be granted a rent free period.
This may be granted either for fitting out purposes or because the market is flat due to the economic climate.
The length of the rent free period will be a question of negotiation between the landlord and the tenant and should be settled prior to the drafting of the lease documentation.
It has been suggested by Customs and Excise that rent free periods may be the subject of value added tax by virtue of their being treated as inducements.
Fortunately the Government has now stated that rent-free periods are outside the scope of VAT unless services are performed in return by the tenant for the landlord.
Therefore, the typical position where the landlord grants the tenant a rent-free period at the commencement of the term would appear to be outside the scope of VAT, at least for the time being.
1.18 "Restrictions" means all matters affecting the Site or the Premises or their use registered or capable of registration as local land charges and all notices charges orders  resolutions demands proposals requirements regulations restrictions agreements directions or other matters affecting the Site the Premises or their use or affecting the Works served or made by any local or other competent authority or otherwise arising under any statute or any regulation or order made under any statute
1.19 Words importing one gender shall be construed as importing any other gender
1.20 Words importing the singular shall be construed as importing the plural and vice versa 1.21 Where any party comprises more than one person the obligations and liabilities of that party under this agreement shall be joint and several obligations and liabilities of those persons
1.22 The clause and clause headings in the body of this agreement and in the Schedules do not form part of this agreement and shall not be taken into account in its construction or interpretation 
2 Works
2.1 In this clause:
2.1.1 "Landlord Approvals" means all approvals consents permissions and licences of any local or other competent authority which may from time to time be necessary to enable the Landlord lawfully to carry out the Works
The local authority may require the landlord to enter into an agreement under s 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
A s 106 agreement may contain various obligations and restrictions affecting the land including uses for which the land may be used.
A s 106 agreement can be registered as a local land charge and can be enforced against estate owners of the land from time to time.
A tenant should ensure that it is made aware of such an agreement so that it can consider the implications of it.
2.1.2 "Building documents" means the plans drawings specifications and other documents relating to the Works which are listed in the third Schedule The tenant should have sight of these as soon as possible to ensure that they are in accordance with its understanding of what has been agreed.
2.1.3 "surveyors" means (Surveyors) of (address) or such other firm of Surveyors previously approved in writing by the Landlord [such approval not to be unreasonably withheld [or delayed]]as the Tenant may from time to time appoint to perform the functions of the Surveyors under this Agreement It would be foolhardy for the tenant to put itself in a position whereby the landlord must approve the identity of its surveyors.
It may also be that where the tenant is a company an in-house surveyor may perform the role.
The clause should therefore be amended: "surveyors" means (Surveyors) of (address) or such other firm of Surveyors or suitably qualified individuals as the Tenant may from time to time appoint to perform the functions of the Surveyors under this agreement
2.2 Subject to all Landlord's Approvals being obtained and continuing in force the Landlord shall at [its]own expense immediately proceed diligently to carry out the Works:
2.2.1 in a good and workmanlike manner and with sound materials of their respective kinds and
2.2.2 in accordance with the terms of all Landlord's Approvals and otherwise in compliance with all Restrictions and
2.2.3 (subject as provided in clauses 2.3 and 2.4) in accordance with the building documents There must be an obligation on the landlord to make application for the approvals as soon as possible after the agreement has been entered into.
In addition to the landlord's approvals there may also be other consents (from superior landlords or mortgagees, for example) or covenants to be complied with in carrying out the works.
Furthermore, care should be had in making the performance of the works subject to the landlord's approvals continuing in force.
Clause 2.2 should preferably commence:
2.2 Subject to all Landlord's Approvals and all other consents being obtained (which the Landlord shall forthwith apply for and obtain with all due expedition) and continuing in force (which continuation in force the Landlord shall use its best endeavours to ensure is maintained) the Landlord shall entirely at its own expense in all respects immediately proceed diligently to carry out and complete the Works:
2.3 If the Landlord is unable to obtain at a reasonable cost any of the materials referred to in the Building Documents the Landlord may [(subject to notifying promptly the Surveyors of its intention to do so)]in carrying out the Works substitute for them alternative materials as nearly as may be of the same quality
2.4 The Landlord may in carrying out the Works make such modification to the Building Documents and to the details of the Landlord's Works contained in them:
2.4.1 as may be required by any local or other competent authority as a condition of the grant or continuance in force of the Landlord's Approvals or any of them or
2.4.2 as may be [reasonably]required by the Architect provided that no modification shall be made pursuant to this clause 2.4.2 which would substantially alter the design layout nature capacity or standard of construction of the Premises as provided for in the Building Documents or substantially prejudice the use of the Premises for the purpose specified in the Lease It may be preferable to substitute the word "materially" for the word "substantially" in clause 2.4.2 as the latter suggests that some alteration less than substantial may be permitted but which could result in not inconsequential prejudice occurring to the design or use of the premises.
The word "reasonably" should definitely be included in the first line of clause 2.4.2.
2.5 The Surveyors may:
2.5.1 at any time on prior appointment with the Architect enter upon the Site and the Premises in order to view the state and progress of the Works but shall not interfere with the carrying out of the Works and
2.5.2 within [5]working days after any such entry serve on the Architect notice ( "Defects Notice" ) specifying any respects in which they consider that the Works are not being or have not been carried out in accordance with this clause
2.6 The Landlord shall procure that the Architect shall have [due]regard to the contents of any Defects Notice This is too weak even with reference to "due" regard.
In English Exporters (London) Ltd v Eldonwall Ltd [1973]Ch 415 at 426 Megarry J stated that the term "have regard" almost of necessity was bound to create difficulties, asking how much regard was to be  had and what weight was to be attached to the regard when it has been had.
Clause 2.6 should therefore read:
2.6 The Landlord shall forthwith investigate the matters contained in the Defects Notice and shall at its own expense remedy or procure the remedying of such matters within [7]days of the service of the Defects Notice by the Tenant
2.7 If at any time any Works are carried out otherwise than in accordance with the Building Documents and this fact might [reasonably]have been expected to be apparent on visual inspection to the Surveyors on the first occasion following the carrying out of the relevant Works on which they actually inspected the same pursuant to clause 2.5 ( "Relevant Inspection" ) then unless within [5]working days after the date of the Relevant Inspection (time being of the essence) the Surveyors have served on the Architect a Defects Notice in respect of such non-compliance the relevant Works shall be treated for all purposes of this agreement as having been carried out in accordance with the Building Documents This provision should be deleted.
It is not reasonable to expect a tenant to have to accept construction works which may differ from those in the building documents and accordingly be less beneficial to the tenant than it may be expecting as a result of what the surveyors may be perceived to notice on an inspection.
The landlord should be responsible for ensuring that the works are carried out in accordance with the building documents and if there are any variations, it must either have them corrected or obtain the tenant's consent to their remaining.
2.8 Subject to the provisions of clause 2.9 the Landlord shall [use all reasonable endeavours to]carry out the Works to such a stage as would entitle the Architect to issue a Certificate in respect of all the Works not later than the day of It is essential that there is a specific date by which the certificate is to be issued even though this may be weakened by the proviso at the beginning of this clause.
The landlord must be given a specific date towards which to work (with time being of the essence), which will obviously also be important from the tenant's point of view as the tenant may be subject to seasonal trade variations in business and may wish, for example, to open the premises in time for the  Christmas trade.
Wherever possible, a tenant should endeavour to delete the opening proviso but this is unlikely to be successful in which case the tenant should amend to include a long stop date (see clause 5.4).
The words in square brackets should, however, be deleted, or at the least the provisions should be amended to "best endeavours" to place a more stringent obligation on the landlord.
Having said that, it has been suggested that the extent of the duty to use best endeavours depends upon the facts in each case and, pursuant to IBM United Kingdom Ltd v Rockware Glass Ltd [1980]FSR 335, it may be that there is little practical difference between a covenant to use best endeavours, a covenant to use reasonable endeavours and a covenant to take all reasonable steps.
But an obligation to use best endeavours does at least suggest something a little more strident than reasonable and could, for example, in the case of a refused application for planning permission, oblige an appeal to be pursued.
Consider adding the following words to this clause: by which date the Premises shall be watertight defect free and in a fit state for fitting out and sufficient access thereto together with a sufficient electricity and water supply shall be available to enable the Tenant to carry out the Tenant's Works/ [fitting out works etc/]
2.9 If on one or more occasion the carrying out of the Works is delayed in consequence of any circumstance beyond the control of the Landlord which the Landlord could not [reasonably]have prevented or avoided then on each such occasion the Landlord shall be allowed such extension of time for carrying out the Works as may be certified by the Architect as being reasonable having regard to the delay in question and the date by which the Landlord is required to carry out the Works as provided in clause 2.8 shall be postponed accordingly The problem here is the uncertainty from the tenant's point of view, hence the suggestion that there be inserted a long stop date (see clause 2.8).
2.10 The Landlord shall procure that no Certificate shall be issued by the Architect unless the Architect has given to the Surveyors not less than [5]working days' notice that the Architect proposes on a date specified in such notice to carry out an inspection ( "Inspection" ) of the Works with a view to issuing a Certificate 
2.11 If the Inspection does not take place or if following the Inspection the relevant Certificate is not issued the Landlord shall procure that the same is not subsequently issued unless notice has again been given to the Surveyors in accordance with clause 2.10 (which procedure shall be repeated as often as necessary until the relevant Certificate is issued)
2.12 The Surveyors shall be entitled to attend every Inspection and the Landlord shall procure that the Architect shall have [due]regard to any written representations made by the Surveyors to the Architect concerning the issue of the Certificate within [3]working days after the date of the Inspection but the issue or non-issue of any Certificate shall be in the sole professional discretion of the Architect
2.13 The Landlord shall procure that a copy of the Certificate of Practical Completion shall be supplied to the Tenant immediately following its issue
2.14 The Landlord shall procure that the obligations of the contractor under clause of the Building Contract are complied with within the period applicable but (save as provided in clause 16.3 [of this agreement and in clause [s]of the Lease]the Landlord shall with effect from the Certificate Date be under no liability to the Tenant in respect of any failure to carry out the Works in accordance with clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 (save as regards matters specified in any Defects Notice which were not remedied to the Surveyor's [reasonable]satisfaction) The part of this clause commencing…but (save as provided in clause 16.3…to the end of the clause should be deleted, as a tenant may consider it unreasonable for a landlord to exempt itself from liability in this manner.
A landlord should be responsible for the manner in which work at its instigation should be carried out and there is no reason why a tenant should suffer as a result of defects appearing within a reasonable time thereafter.
It is now not unusual for warranties or duty of care deeds to be offered to a tenant by the landlord's professional "team" generally consisting of architects, surveyors, structural engineers and main contractors.
Such warranties create contractual obligations with the result that a tenant should be able to maintain an action against the professional party in the event of a breach subsequently occurring, or occurring within the time  specified in the warranty.
There has in fact been a good deal of legal commentary in recent months as to the effectiveness of warranties, but it would be advisable for a tenant to take up warranties (in a standard and acceptable form) if they are available.
Where warranties are to be given the following additional clause may be contained in the agreement:
The Landlord shall procure that prior to the issue of the Certificate of Practical Completion there shall be delivered to the Tenant collateral warranty agreements signed by or on behalf of the Architect the Landlord's structural engineers the Landlord's Contractors and the Landlord's Surveyors such collateral warranty agreements to be in the form of the drafts annexed hereto
The tenant will need to have sight of, and approve, the form of the warranties prior to the exchange of the agreement for lease.
Where no such warranties are to be given, or even in addition to such warranties, the tenant should consider including the following clause, even if subsequent negotiations with the landlord result in some watering down:
Notwithstanding anything herein contained or the completion of the Lease nothing in this agreement shall release the Landlord from any liability in respect of defects appearing in the Works due to bad or faulty workmanship or design or materials provided notice of the same shall have been given to the Landlord by the Tenant or its successors in title before the expiration of the period of [6]years from the date hereof and upon receipt of such notice the Landlord shall forthwith take such action as may be necessary to remedy the defects at its own expense with all possible expedition 
3 Tenant's works
3.1 In this clause:
3.1.1 "Tenant's Approvals" means all (if any) approvals consents permissions and licences of any local or other competent authority which may from time to time be necessary to enable the Tenant lawfully to commence and to carry out the Tenant's Works
3.1.2 "Plans" means detailed plans drawings and specifications  setting out the Tenant's proposals for the Tenant's Works and such other documentation and information as the Landlord may [reasonably]require in order to satisfy [itself]as to the nature and extent of the Tenant's Works
3.2 The Landlord shall procure that as soon as in the opinion of the Architect the Works on the Premises are sufficiently advanced to enable the Tenant to commence and carry out the Tenant's Works the Architect shall give notice to the Tenant to that effect
3.3 The Tenant shall as soon as practicable after the date of this agreement at its own expense prepare the Plans and submit them to the Landlord for approval [such approval not to be unreasonably withheld [or delayed]]The landlord's approval of the plans should not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and it would be advisable for the tenant to commence the preparation of the plans as soon as it may be practicable in order to avoid subsequent delay.
3.4 Immediately upon such approval being obtained the Tenant shall at its own expense apply for and use all reasonable endeavours to obtain without delay all Tenant's Approvals The question of timing again arises and the tenant may prefer this provision to be watered down slightly as follows:
3.4 As soon as practicable upon such approval being obtained the Tenant shall at its own expense apply for and use all reasonable endeavours to obtain all Tenant's Approvals
3.5 With effect from the Possession Date or (if later) the date on which the Tenant has obtained all Tenant's Approvals the Tenant shall have licence and authority to enter upon the Premises for the purpose of carrying out the Tenant's Works in accordance with clause 3.7 but for no other purpose The problem is that the words "but for no other purpose" could result in a period of non-user from the date of completion of the tenant's works and the date of the completion of the lease (see clause 1.15.2) and the clause should be amended as follows:
3.5 With effect from carrying out the Tenant's Works in accordance with clause 3.7 and thereafter to commence business at the Premises for the purpose permitted by the Lease 
3.6 To the extent that the Tenant has exclusive possession of the Premises at any time before completion of the Lease the Tenant shall hold the same as Tenant at will of the Landlord The tenant may wish to delete this clause despite a footnote to the precedent to the effect that any purported determination of the tenancy at will by the landlord (other than where provided for in clause 5) would presumably contribute a breach of contract, ie for withdrawing the authority granted by clause 3.5.
It is also suggested that determination by the tenant would give rise to a breach, ie failure to carry out the tenant's works.
This may be a perfectly valid statement of the law but if a court decided otherwise the consequences for the tenant could be regrettable.
Javad v Aquil [1991]All ER 243 confirms that the concept of a tenancy at will remains a reality and while the landlord may be concerned that the tenant should not become a periodic tenant until the grant of the lease, the tenant may wish to ensure that it has something more concrete than a tenancy at will.
3.7 The Tenant shall at [its]own expense carry out and with due expedition complete the Tenant's Works:
3.7.1 in a good and workmanlike manner and with sound materials of their respective kinds
3.7.2 in accordance with the Plans approved by the Landlord pursuant to clause 3.3 Add the following words to clause 3.7.2: or as amended with the approval of the Landlord (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
3.7.3 in accordance with the terms of all Tenant's Approvals and otherwise in compliance with all requirements of the local and any other competent authority
3.7.4 in such a way as to cause no [material]obstruction to or interference with the carrying out of the Works
3.7.5 to the [reasonable]satisfaction of the Architect in all respects
3.8 The Tenant shall:
3.8.1 pay and indemnify the Landlord against all fees charges and other payments whatever which may at any time be payable to any local or other competent authority in respect of the Tenant's Works 
3.8.2 be answerable for and indemnify the Landlord against all actions costs claims demands and liability whatever in relation to any failure by the Tenant to comply with [its]obligations under clause 3.7.3 or in relation to any claim made by any adjoining owner or occupier or member of the public or other person in connection with the carrying out of the Tenant's Works
3.8.2 with effect from the Possession Date pay and indemnify the Landlord against all rates taxes assessments duties charges impositions and outgoings from time to time charged upon the Premises or the owner or occupier of them Although unlikely to have such a constriction placed on it, there is something to be said for inserting a similar exclusion into this clause to that inserted in clause 5.2.1 of the lease.
3.9 The Landlord shall procure that as soon as practicable after the Tenant's Works have been [substantially]completed in accordance with clause 3.7 to the [reasonable]satisfaction of the Architect in all respects the Architect shall issue to the Landlord and the Tenant a certificate to that effect ( "Tenant's Certificate" ) The words in brackets should be included as part of the clause.
3.10 Subject as provided in clause 5.5.3 all fixtures affixed to or installed in the Premises as part of the Tenant's Works (other than Tenant's fixtures) shall become and remain the property of the Landlord notwithstanding that any of them may be affixed or installed after completion of the Lease The difficulty here is ensuring that both parties know what are tenant's fixtures and it may be as well to include in a schedule the fixtures to which the landlord is referring.
4 Form of Lease
[4.1]The Landlord may at any time before the Certificate Date require the form of the Lease and the rights and obligations of the parties under it to be varied in such manner as the Landlord shall [reasonably]require to take account of any modifications made in accordance with clause 2.4 after the date of this agreement  There is limited scope in this clause for substantial amendment to the form of the lease and as very few amendments are foreseeable, a tenant may be justified in deleting this provision, although clause 4.2 contains safeguards which make the clause tolerable if the landlord insists on its retention.
Any clause containing the right for the landlord to vary the lease more substantially should be resisted strongly and the footnote to this clause contains the suggestion that in such circumstances the tenant should insist on a provision that no variation be made which would, eg reduce the area of the premises or affect their use or increase the tenant's liability under the lease.
[4.2 If by the Certificate Date the parties have been unable to agree whether any requirement of the Landlord made pursuant to clause 4.1 is reasonable the matter or matters in dispute shall be referred to a counsel to be agreed upon between the parties or failing agreement within [5]working days after the Certificate Date to one of the conveyancing counsel for the time being of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice [ "Counsel" ]to be nominated on the application of either party by the President for the time being of the Law Society (or his duly appointed deputy or any other person authorised by him to make appointments on his behalf) and Counsel shall:
4.2.1 act as an expert and not as an arbitrator
4.2.2 invite the parties to subject to him within such time limits as he may direct such written representations concerning the matter or matters in dispute as they may respectively wish
4.2.3 have such regard (if any) to any such representations as he shall consider appropriate
4.2.4 make such modifications to the form of the draft lease annexed as in the opinion of Counsel shall be necessary to incorporate any requirements of the Landlord made pursuant to clause 4.1 which in the opinion of Counsel are reasonable and
4.2.5 notify such modifications in writing to the Landlord and the Tenant
4.3 Counsel's fees and the costs of his appointment shall:
4.3.1 (if no modification is made by Counsel in accordance with clause 4.2.4) be borne by the Landlord
4.3.2 (if in Counsel's opinion all of the Landlord's requirements were reasonable) be borne by the Tenant and 
4.3.3 (in any other case) be borne by the parties equally]If clause 4.1 is included, there must obviously also be a machinery to cover the possibility of a dispute.
There is no real objection to any of the provisions in clauses 4.2 or 4.3 which seem sensible and fair from both parties' points of view, assuming of course that the tenant has been unsuccessful in having clause 4.1 deleted.
5 Termination
5.1 If at any time before completion of the Lease the Tenant (being an individual) dies or has a receiving order made against him or is adjudicated bankrupt or (being a company) has a petition presented for its winding up or goes into liquidation or (in either case) enters into a composition with his or its creditors then the provisions of clause 5.4 shall have effect immediately
5.2 If for any reason:
5.2.1 The Certificate of Practical Completion has not been issued by the expiry of the period of immediately following the date of this agreement or
5.2.2 the Tenant's Certificate has not been issued by the expiry of the period of immediately following the Possession Date then the provisions of clause 5.4 shall have effect immediately upon the expiry of the relevant period (or upon the expiry of such extended period as the parties may within the relevant period agree in writing)
5.3 If at any time there has been any [material]noncompliance by the Landlord with any of [its]obligations under clause 2 or by the Tenant with any of [its]obligations under clause 3 and such default shall continue for or shall not be remedied to the [reasonable]satisfaction of the party not in default within [15]working days (time being of the essence) after service on the party in default by the other part of a notice specifying the default and invoking the provisions of this clause then the provisions of clause 5.4 shall have effect immediately upon the expiry of the relevant period
5.4 If any of the circumstances specified in clauses 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 or if the Tenant fails to comply with [its]obligations under clause 6.5 then and in any such case this agreement  shall (save for clauses 3.8 and 5.5 and without prejudice to any pre-existing right of action of either party in respect of any breach by the other of [its]obligations under this agreement) immediately determine and cease to have effect and neither party shall be under any further liability to the other under this agreement
5.5 If this agreement determines in accordance with clause 5.4:
5.5.1 the Tenant shall immediately procure the cancellation of any land charge registered at HM Land Charges Registry in respect of this agreement
5.5.2 the Tenant shall (if in occupation) immediately vacate the Premises and remove from the Premises all (if any) building and other materials and equipment on the Premises in connection with the Tenant's Works
5.5.3 the Landlord shall be entitled immediately or at any time subsequently to take and retain possession of all (if any) completed or partially completed Tenant's Works on the Premises which shall be forfeited and become the property of the Landlord and the Landlord shall not be liable to make to the Tenant any compensation or allowance in respect of them
This clause contains a number of matters of principal importance.
Clause 5.1 for instance could be of concern not only to the tenant but also to the tenant's mortgagees.
Some comfort may be had by adding the following words to the end of this clause: provided that the Tenant shall have the same rights of relief against forfeiture as if the Lease had been completed
It is essential that some time limit be placed on the time within which the (landlord's) works are to be completed and the certificate of practical completion issued (see clause 2.8).
This period will of course depend upon the nature of the works being carried out and while the landlord will expect quite a long overrun period, it should be possible for the landlord and the tenant to agree a suitable long stop date.
Similarly, it is understandable that a landlord will wish to ensure that the tenant's works are completed within a reasonable time.
A tenant could argue that as rents will probably be geared to the issue of the certificate of practical completion, there may be no immediate financial disadvantage to the landlord.
The landlord will  nevertheless wish to ensure that the premises are occupied and trading as soon as possible, particularly if they are located in a parade or shopping centre where the landlord's adjoining premises could benefit from customers to the premises.
The problem from the tenant's point of view is that a termination under 5.2.1 will not (at least in a normal market) result in the (landlord's) works being wasted, whereas the tenant may have expended a considerable sum of money not only on its works but also in preliminary arrangements.
The tenant may then discover that an unforeseen delay for which it is not responsible results in revocation of the agreement and if clause 5.5.3 remains unamended the tenant will receive no compensation for works carried out prior to such termination.
The tenant should therefore initially attempt to delete clause 5.2.2, but if this is not accepted a sufficiently long date should be inserted in it.
Clause 5.5.1 should refer also to the cancellation of any notice or caution registered at HM Land Registry, but the absence of such reference will be of no concern of the tenant.
Clause 5.5.3 is unreasonable and should be deleted.
The tenant's works will probably include valuable fitting out items and while a landlord will wish to reclaim vacant possession of the premises as soon as possible after determination in order to seek a reletting, the handing over of the tenant's works should be resisted.
The following amendment is perhaps a fair compromise:
5.5.3 the Landlord shall be entitled which shall be forfeited and become the property of the Landlord where the Tenant fails to remove them within 5 working days of receipt from the Landlord of a notice in writing to do so 
6 Grant of Lease
6.1 Subject to the above provisions of this agreement the Landlord shall grant the Lease and the Tenant shall accept the Lease and execute a counterpart of it
6.2 The Lease and the counterpart shall be prepared by the Landlord's Solicitors and an engrossment of the counterpart shall be delivered to the offices of the Tenant's Solicitors at least[5]working days before the Completion Date Five working days is too short for most institutional tenants to  execute and return documentation, particularly where the tenant's solicitor has to check the engrossment against the agreed form attached to the agreement for lease.
Incidentally, it is imperative that the tenant's solicitor checks the engrossment or at least delegates it to some competent person in his office to do.
Quite often leases are not granted until some years after the agreement for lease with the result that the fair copy has to be typed on to the landlord's solicitor's updated wordprocessing system.
This can result in errors which can be costly if not picked up by the tenant's solicitor.
Therefore, amend this clause to read:…at least[15]working days…to allow for pre-completion searches, etc as well .
6.3 The Lease shall be completed on the Completion Date at the offices of the Landlord's solicitors or at such other place as the Landlord's solicitors shall [reasonably]require The parties' solicitors will normally agree to complete without the necessity for personal attendance, but the tenant's solicitor may wish to amend this clause to provide for the agreed arrangements regarding completion, particularly where the landlord's solicitor's office is in Berwick-upon-Tweed and the tenant's solicitor is in Penzance.
6.4 At any time on or after the Completion Date either the Landlord or the Tenant being ready and willing to complete the Lease and perform [its]other obligations under this agreement may (but without prejudice to any other available right or remedy) by notice to the other invoke the provisions of clause 6.5
6.5 Within [15]working days after service of such notice (excluding the day of service) the Lease shall be completed and time shall be of the essence of this provision Advisable though this clause may be, the problem is that the agreement is liable to be brought to an end at the expiration of the notice, which could have dire consequences for a tenant who has expended a considerable sum of money on the tenant's works but is for some reason unable to complete.
It is therefore sensible for a tenant who encounters such difficulties to advise the landlord of its position as early as possible in the hope of preventing the service of a completion notice.
7 Rent Commencement [and trading]
[7.1]If the Lease is completed rent shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the Lease with effect from the Rent Commencement Date [[7.2]The Tenant shall commence trading from the Premises not more than after the Completion Date]It is important to ascertain if any rent free period is to include not only the rack rent but also service charges and/or insurance premiums.
Usually, these will commence from the possession date, but this is not always the case and it is suggested that, unless the agreed form of lease makes it clear, liability with regard to service charges and insurance should be dealt with in this clause.
Clause 7.2 should be resisted.
Various factors could prevent the tenant from commencing to trade within a specified period and where a tenant has fitted out the premises and is paying a full rent (or using up a rent free period) the tenant would hopefully only delay opening for trade for a good reason.
8 Damages etc
No damage to or destruction of the Site or the Premises or any part of the Site or the Premises however occasioned shall in any way affect the obligations of the parties under this agreement Firstly, it is suggested that the tenant should inspect the premises and the site (if, for instance, access to the premises is across other parts of the site) immediately before exchange.
Secondly, although the doctrine of frustration applies to agreements for lease, it would be only in quite exceptional circumstances where an agreement would be set aside on the grounds of frustration and it is suggested that the parties should provide in the agreement for either party to rescind the agreement in the event of substantial damage to the premises or the site prior to completion.
It may, therefore, be advisable to delete this clause and substitute the following:
In the event of substantial damage to or destruction of the Site or the Premises or any part of the Site or the Premises however occasioned either party hereto may determine this agreement forthwith by serving notice to that effect on the other party and in such case this agreement shall  (without prejudice to any pre-existing right of action of either party in respect of any breach by the other of its obligations under this agreement) immediately determine and cease to have effect and neither party shall be under any further liability to the other under this agreement and any dispute or difference between the parties as to what constitutes substantial damage or destruction for the purpose of this clause shall be decided by an independent Surveyor who shall act as an expert and who shall be appointed by the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors upon the application of either party 
9 Title
9.1 The Tenant shall assume the right of the Landlord to grant the Lease and shall not require any evidence of or raise any objection requisition or inquiry in respect of the Landlord's title to the Site [or the Premises]
9.2 The Premises shall be demised subject to the matters set out or referred to in clause…of the draft lease annexed and the Tenant or the Tenant's solicitors having been supplied with such information as the Landlord has concerning the same the Tenant has entered into this agreement with notice of and shall raise no objection requisition or inquiry in respect of such matters
Section 44(2)—(4) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the tenant from investigating either the freehold or leasehold reversion when taking a lease of premises.
It is suggested, however, that neither clause 9.1 nor 9.2 will offer any protection to a landlord who has misrepresented or misdescribed its title.
A misrepresentation or misdescription could result in the landlord being unable to enforce the terms of the agreement.
In general terms, a landlord (like a vendor) should disclose to the prospective tenant any defects in title that may not be obvious to the tenant unless it was clear that the tenant knew of the defects when it entered into the agreement for lease.
Nevertheless, clauses 9.1 and 9.2 are dangerous as a tenant will prefer to know at the outset whether any defects affect the premises and the tenant's solicitor should amend them as follows:
9.1 The Landlord shall declare its title to grant the Lease [including the production of the freehold title][and shall do all things necessary to enable the Tenant to obtain registration of the Lease at HM Land Registry with Title Absolute]This will include the provision by the landlord of all consents, mortgagee's or otherwise, necessary for the grant of the lease.
If the landlord's title is registered at HM Land Registry, the tenant should consider protecting the agreement by notice or caution.
A notice is preferable as it imposes greater protection than a caution (which can be warned off) but requires the consent of the landlord as the land certificate will need to be placed on deposit for the purpose of registration.
In the case of registered land the following additional words should be included at the end of clause 9.1:
and the Landlord shall forthwith deposit its land certificate in respect of the Site at HM Land Registry and inform the Tenant of the deposit number thereof within three working days of notice of the deposit number being given to the Landlord to enable the Tenant to register a notice of this agreement
9.2 The Premises shall be demised subject to the matters set out in clause…of the draft lease annexed
Even with the latter part of this clause (as drafted) included it has been held that a landlord must still make full disclosure and not mislead the tenant nor will these words protect the landlord from an action for misrepresentation or misdescription.
10 Restrictions
10.1 The Premises shall be demised subject to all (if any) Restrictions affecting the Premises (whether in existence at the date of this agreement or arising at any later date)
10.2 No representation is made or warranty given by the Landlord as to whether any Restrictions exist or as to the permitted use of the Site or the Premises for planning purposes
10.3 The Tenant acknowledges that [its]obligations under this agreement and the Lease shall not be affected or lessened in any way by the fact that there may now or subsequently  exist any Restrictions and the Tenant shall with effect from the Possession Date comply with and indemnify the Landlord in respect of any liability under any Restrictions (whether made before or after the Possession Date) save in so far as such liability arises from failure by the Landlord to comply with [its]obligations under clause 2.2.2 It need hardly be said that the tenant's solicitor should make all usual inquiries to ascertain whether any such restrictions exist at the date of the agreement.
The following wording should be added to clause 10.1:
AND the Landlord hereby warrants to the Tenant that it has disclosed to the Tenant details of all Restrictions affecting the Premises known (or which ought reasonably be known) to the Landlord as at the date hereof Clause 10.2 should commence:
Save as provided in clause 10.1…
Clause 10.2 will not protect a landlord where there has been a warranty given, as in the amended 10.1 above, a misrepresentation made or where there has been a misdescription of the site.
11 Representations etc
11.1 Save as provided in clause 11.2 no agent adviser or other person acting for the Landlord has at any time prior to the making of this agreement been authorised by the Landlord to make to the Tenant or to any agent adviser or other person acting for the Tenant any representation whatever (whether written oral or implied) in relation to the Site or the Premises or to any matter contained or referred to in this agreement
11.2 Any statement made in writing by the Landlord's solicitors to the Tenant's solicitors prior to the making of this agreement [in reply to an inquiry made in writing by the Tenant's solicitors]was made with the authority of the Landlord
11.3 No immaterial error omission or misstatement in this agreement or in any plan of the Site or the Premises referred to in this agreement or in any statement made by any person prior to the making of this agreement shall in  any way affect the obligations of the parties under this agreement or entitle any party to damages or compensation
As the Encyclopaedia points out, there are a number of clauses in common use in leases attempting to place a limitation on the landlord's liability for misrepresentation, misdescription and non-disclosure, but fortunately (from the tenant's point of view) many such clauses are ineffective.
Nevertheless, a landlord will be entitled to limit the authority of an agent to make representations and clauses 11.1 and 11.2 have been drafted with this in mind.
It is suggested that the words in square brackets be deleted from clause 11.2 as the landlord's solicitors will doubtless make several statements in writing to the tenant's solicitors during a transaction and not always in reply to written inquiries.
Clause 11.3 relates to misrepresentations and misdescriptions, the position as to the latter being similar to non-disclosure in that it can render the landlord liable in damages for breach of contract.
If the misdescription is material the tenant would be able to rescind the agreement irrespective of whether or not the word "immaterial" is included in clause 11.3.
If "immaterial" is excluded from clause 11.3 then, whatever the nature of the misdescription, a tenant seeking specific performance would not be entitled to compensation or damages.
The tenant should consider deleting both clauses 11.1 and 11.2 though for the reasons given they could perhaps be tolerated if necessary.
The words in brackets in clause 11.2 should be deleted.
Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff Group Ltd held that misstatements by a landlord's solicitors in replies to inquiries could not result in an action (of negligence) against the solicitors, but that such replies were given on behalf of the landlord.
Any such action would therefore lie against the landlord, but the landlord may well have a claim against its solicitors for negligence.
12 Non-assignment
The Tenant shall not assign underlet charge or otherwise deal in any way with the benefit of this agreement in whole or in part and the Landlord shall not be obliged to grant the Lease to any person other than the Tenant This is not acceptable and must at least be qualified to allow the tenant to mortgage or charge the premises which might be vital to  the tenant to fund the tenant's works or its business in general.
It is also suggested that a company tenant which has already created a charge or debenture over future acquired property would be in breach of this clause upon exchange of agreements.
In addition, it is not unknown for a lease to be granted several years after the date of the agreement for lease particularly where the landlord's own interest is leasehold and the completion of its lease is dependent upon various factors and conditions.The writer is aware of an agreement for lease granted in 1965 purporting to grant a 21-year lease where the landlord was still not in a position to grant the lease by the expiration of the agreed term in 1986.
Landlords are often amenable to amendments permitting an assignment of an agreement for lease, usually after any tenant's works have been completed, but subject to the assignee covenanting with the landlord to be bound by the terms and conditions of the agreement, which is not unreasonable.
Where there is a surety to the agreement and an assignment by the tenant is agreed by the landlord, it is advisable to ensure that while the surety may still be forced to be bound by the obligations on its part contained in the agreement, the surety should not be forced to be a party to the lease.
Any provision for the original tenant under the agreement to be joined in the lease as surety for the assignee should be vehemently resisted.
Basic amendments to clause 12 could be the addition of the following provisos:
Provided that the Tenant shall be entitled to mortgage or charge its interest hereunder with the previous consent of the Landlord (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
Provided that if the Lease shall not have been granted within a period of 12 months from the date hereof the Tenant shall be at liberty to assign underlet or otherwise deal with the benefit of this agreement subject to the same conditions as would be applicable to a corresponding transaction if the Lease had then been granted 
13 Notices
13.1 In this clause:
13.1.1 "the Landlord's Address" means the address of the Landlord  shown on the first page of this agreement or such other address as the Landlord may from time to time notify to the Tenant as being [its]address for the purpose of this agreement
13.1.2 "the Tenant's Address" means the address of the Tenant shown on the first page of this agreement or such other address as the Tenant may from time to time notify to the Landlord as being [its]address for service for the purposes of this agreement
13.2 Any notice or other communication given or made in accordance with this agreement shall be in writing and:
13.2.1 may (in addition to any other effective mode of service) be sent by registered or recorded delivery post and
13.2.2 shall (in the case of a notice or other communication to the Landlord but subject to clause 13.3.1) be served on the Landlord at the Landlord's Address
13.2.3 shall (in the case of a notice or other communication to the Tenant but subject to clause 13.3.2) be served on the Tenant at the Tenant's Address
13.3 Any notice or other communication given or made in accordance with this agreement:
13.3.1 by or to the Landlord may be given or made by or to the Landlord's solicitors on behalf of the Landlord
13.3.2 by or to the Tenant may be given or made by or to the Tenant's solicitors on behalf of the Tenant The only point to make is to ensure that any notices to be served on the tenant will be certain to be received, which they may not be if served at the premises.
14 Costs
The Tenant shall on the making of this Agreement pay to the Landlord the sum of £ (pounds) as a contribution towards the legal and other professional costs incurred by the Landlord in relation to this agreement Obviously, the tenant should try to avoid paying the landlord's costs if possible as the transaction is presumably to the equal benefit of both the landlord and the tenant.
This clause should accordingly be deleted wherever possible.
If not possible, however, a tenant should try to avoid paying VAT on the contribution.
If there is no such provision in the agreement, the tenant would not be liable to pay the landlord's legal costs in respect of the agreement (or the lease).
15 Executory Agreement
15.1 This agreement is an executory agreement only and shall not operate or be deemed to operate as a demise of the Premises An executory agreement is an agreement to be followed by a lease, usually after various preliminary matters have been dealt with or some future act has been done, eg works have been completed.
15.2 Save as provided in clause 3 the Tenant shall not be entitled to occupation or possession of the Premises until the Lease is completed This clause should be deleted—see note to clause 3.5, though the suggested amendment to clause 3.5, if accepted, should be a satisfactory compromise.
16 Non-merger etc
16.1 Subject as provided in clause 2.14 all the provisions of this agreement shall (to the extent that they remain to be observed and performed) continue in full force and effect notwithstanding completion of the Lease
16.2 [Subject as provided in clause [s]of the Lease no or No]defect in the Works or the Premises at the date on which the Lease is granted shall in any way lessen or affect the obligations of the Tenant under the Lease
16.3 On completion of the Lease the parties shall enter into a deed in the form of the draft deed annexed to this Agreement marked and initialled by or on behalf of the parties
Clause 16.2 gives great cause for concern.
Defects can quite often appear after the lease has been granted and the tenant will not expect to have to repair defects as part of its own obligations under a full repairing lease or even through the service charge provisions of the lease where the landlord covenants to repair and charge back.
If any duty of care deeds are available from contractors, engineers, surveyors or other professional persons then they  should be taken up.
Also consider as an alternative requesting building defects insurance (premiums to be paid for by the landlord) such as ten year latent defects insurance—but if not available, or in addition to such deeds etc, the tenant should consider including the clause suggested at clause 2.14.
17 Entire understanding
17.1 This agreement embodies the entire understanding of the parties and there are no other arrangements between the parties relating to the subject matter of this agreement
17.2 No amendment or modification of this agreement shall be valid or binding on any party unless the same:
17.2.1 is made in writing
17.2.2 refers expressly to this agreement and
17.2.3 is signed by the party concerned or its duly authorised representative
The problem with clause 17.1 is that it could prevent the parties from agreeing supplemental matters in side letters exchanged at the same time as the agreement.
While this practice is not to be recommended, it does happen and even without the wording of clause 17.1 Section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 could be instrumental.
This section provides that the terms which the parties have agreed in respect of a disposition of an interest in land must be incorporated in one document either by being set out in the document or by reference to another document.
The position with regard to side letters (setting out supplemental agreements) is that they may not be binding as they probably will not have been referred to in the principal agreement.
In fact, courts have tended to "save" such side letters wherever possible by taking a constructive rather than technical approach (see Tootal Clothing Ltd v Guinea Properties Management Ltd, The Times, 8 June 1992), but the following amendment to clause 17.1 may assist:
17.1 This agreement embodies the entire understanding of the parties save as augmented by any side letter [s][or other agreement[s]]exchanged contemporaneously with this agreement and signed by the parties hereto or by their duly authorised agents which side letter [s][or agreement[s]]shall take effect either as a collateral agreement to this agreement or if it [they]shall be incorporated by  express reference all the terms and conditions of such side letter [s][or other agreement [s]]shall be treated as being a single composite agreement with this agreement and subject thereto there are no other arrangements between the parties relating to the subject matter of this agreement It may be advisable to include an arbitration provision, either to deal with any particular point in the agreement or to attempt to resolve disputes in general.
If this is thought advisable, the following additional clause could be added:
In the event of any dispute or difference between the parties hereto concerning any matter of thing arising under this agreement such dispute or difference shall be referred to an independent surveyor agreed between the parties hereto or in default of agreement to a surveyor appointed for the purpose on the application of either party by the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors who shall act as an arbitrator pursuant to the Arbitration Acts 1950 to 1979 or any statutory re-enactment thereof for the time being in force 
[AS or IN]WITNESS etc
There is no necessity for the agreement for lease to be under seal as the promise to grant and accept the lease will be adequate consideration, and although it is suggested that the agreement should be under seal if one or more of the parties is a company (to secure the presumption of due execution) in practice this is not usually done.
The Lease
Particulars Definitions and Interpretation
It is now common practice to commence a lease with particulars, definitions and interpretation, which are particularly useful as leases have become longer.
The particulars in fact also act as a ready reference in certain respects.
LEASE OF PART
Dated:
1 Particulars
1.1.1 The Landlord [AB or AB [Ltd or plc]](Landlord)[of (address etc) or whose registered office is at (address)][Company Reg No]
1.1.2 The Tenant [CD or CD [Ltd or plc]](Tenant)[of (address etc) or whose registered office is at (address)][Company Reg No]
The Encyclopaedia states that the definitions of "landlord" and "tenant" are preferable to "lessor" and "lessee" in order to make a clear distinction and avoid problems caused by carelessness.
A tenant may not be in a position to determine which definitions are used, but it is a point worth noting.
Company registration numbers are sometimes included in the case of company landlords, tenants and guarantors to assist with the more positive identification of companies for search purposes at HM Land Registry.
1.2 The centre ALL THAT (describe the Centre) shown [for the purpose of identification only]edged [with a thick black line]on the Plan
There is no objection to including a definition of the centre in the particulars part of the lease, although it may more usually be included in clause 2 under the definitions section.
It is advisable for the precise extent of the centre to be readily identifiable and the tenant should take care to ensure that where there is a right for the landlord to extend or reduce the centre, such extension or reduction does not adversely affect the tenant's use or occupation of the premises and that there is provision for any specific service charge percentages to be varied accordingly.
1.3 The premises Unit no of the Centre more particularly defined in the First Schedule The premises must be readily identifiable and provision in the particulars is mainly for a unit or postal number to be inserted.
1.4 Contractual term years from and including the day of See comments under clause 1.12 of the agreement for lease.
It is sensible for the term to be stated to be from and including a specific date to avoid the uncertainty caused by the general law that a term which is to commence "from" a certain date in fact commences at the beginning of the following day, with the term lasting during the whole anniversary of the day from which it is granted, unless there is some contra-indication in the lease.
It appears that if the lease states that the term is to commence "on" a specified date, the term will include that date.
1.5 Rent commencement Date the day of The rent commencement date will not always be the date of the lease, eg where there is a rent free period or where the tenant has been in occupation of the premises prior to the date of the lease and is to pay rent from the date of occupation.
1.6 Initial rent £ (pounds) per year  The initial rent will be inserted and should be checked.
1.7 Review dates (insert review dates) and "Review Date" means any one of the Review Dates
Many leases deal with rent review dates by stating that the initial rent will be subject to review on the day of and thereafter in every [fifth]anniversary of that date during the term.
It is contended that, at least where the interpretation of "the term" includes not only the contractual term but also any period of holding over or extension of the contractual term, this could result in the landlord being entitled to review the rent on the day of the commencement of any period of holding over under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.
In an upwards market this would benefit the landlord, who could never hope to achieve a full market rent pursuant to an interim rent application, but would disadvantage the tenant, who would presumably prefer the old rent to continue during negotiations, thereby acting as a negotiating factor.
1.8 Interest rate % per year above the base lending rate of XY Bank [Ltd or plc]or such other bank [being a member of the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers]as the Landlord may from time to time nominate in writing
The interest rate is a matter for negotiation.
It is supposed to be a penal rate and tenants are expected to pay their rent (and other payments due under the lease) on time.
Having said that, it is a comparatively recent imposition for rents to be payable in advance as opposed to in arrear and many tenants would argue that some account should be taken of the fact that landlords have had their money, and therefore presumably interest on it, in advance.
The interest provision should in fact interrelate with the "period of grace" provision and a suggested formula is 2 per cent above base lending rate if payment is not made within 14 days after becoming due or 3 per cent above if not made within 21 days.
The other point to mention is the identity of the bank, which should most certainly be a member of the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers.
In addition, the landlord should not be entitled to switch banks as it may wish and the tenant should consider adding the following additional words at the end of this provision: in the event that XY Bank [Ltd or plc]subsequently fails to publish a base lending rate
Some interest provisions attempt to insert a minimum rate, which should be avoided by both the landlord and the tenant.
The landlord should beware should interest rates fall dramatically leaving the minimum rate at a level substantially higher than the standard borrowing rate, in which case the interest may be void as amounting to a penalty; and the tenant would be advised not to run the risk of having to pay interest at a substantially higher rate than the basic lending rate.
1.9 Prohibited users (specify prohibited users)
This is self-explanatory and the tenant should be cautious of allowing the landlord to include various prohibited users which may not affect the tenant's business but could restrict the persons to whom the tenant may wish to assign or sublet the premises.
1.10 Permitted user (specify user) or such other use not being one of the Prohibited Users that falls within Class [A1]as referred to in Part A of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 as the Landlord shall from time to time approve [such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or [or delayed]]
The permitted user will of course depend upon the use for which the tenant wishes to use the premises and will also be a matter of negotiation.
The tenant will not wish to restrict himself to too narrow a use, for while this might be satisfactory in the short term, if the lease is for 25 years much can happen to the tenant's business, eg expansion or contraction resulting in the necessity for the tenant to assign or sublet the premises, in which case the assignee or subtenant may wish to carry on a different use.
The tenant will, however, need to ensure that too wide a use will not have adverse consequences on rent review.
In view of the comment made under clause 3.16 it may be as well to interpolate the following words after the reference to the 1987 Order:(to which the provisions of clause 3.16 shall not apply)
1.11 Decorating years (specify years)
The tenant should ensure that these are not too frequent.
1.12 Shop opening hours (specify hours) on Mondays to Saturdays (inclusive) other than Christmas Day Good Friday and any other statutory bank (or local) holiday
Leases quite often attempt to restrict the opening hours of premises, not only in respect of shops but also offices.
There is no logical reason for this where premises stand alone and in such circumstances these provisions should be deleted.
It is understandable that leases of premises in shopping centres may contain restrictions on the opening hours of the premises either because of centralised heating and other services or because the main gates to the centre, or to the servicing facilities, are closed.
If this provision is to apply the tenant may wish to negotiate personal arrangements with the landlord for occupation outside these hours for special circumstances.
1.13 Service charge % subject to the provisions for percentage variation contained in the sixth schedule
See comments under sixth schedule Part A paragraph 5.
1.14 Initial provisional £ service charge (pounds) per year
This must be inserted and checked for accuracy.
1.15 Insurance rent percentage %
This must be inserted and checked for accuracy.
2 Definitions
2.1 For all purposes of this Lease the terms defined in clauses 1 and 2 and Paragraph 1 of the fourth schedule and the sixth schedule have the meanings specified
This is self-explanatory.
2.2 "Accountant" means any person or firm appointed by the Landlord (including an employee of the Landlord or a  Group Company) to perform any of the functions of the Accountant under this Lease
The accountant, and for that matter any other professional persons, have very important roles to play in the lease and for this purpose alone the tenant will wish to ensure that they are suitably qualified.
The minimum amendment that the tenant would expect is as follows:
means any suitably qualified person or firm but the tenant should consider the following alternative suggested in the notes to the precedent:
 "Accountant" means a chartered accountant acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator appointed by agreement between the parties or in default of agreement nominated by the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
2.3 "Adjoining Property" means any neighbouring or adjoining land or premises (excluding the remainder of the Centre) in which the Landlord or a Group Company has a freehold or leasehold interest or in which during the Term the Landlord or a Group Company shall have acquired a freehold or leasehold interest There is no objection to this provided that the existence of any adjoining property does not have an adverse effect on the tenant's contribution towards service charges or other costs referred to in the lease and the tenant should therefore be vigilant in this regard when amending the lease.
2.4 "Common Parts" means any malls and other pedestrian ways concourses and circulation areas staircases escalators ramps and lifts service roads loading bays forecourts and other ways and areas in the Centre which are from time to time during the Term provided by the Landlord for common use by customers frequenting the Centre and by the Tenants and the occupiers of the Centre or persons expressly or by implication authorised by them Although it is highly unlikely that the landlord would so amend or alter the common parts to make it impossible for the tenant to carry on its business, the following additional wording may be considered:
Provided that there shall at all times [during the Shop  Opening Hours]be full and sufficient common parts to enable the Tenant or any undertenant to carry on its normal business at the Premises
2.5 "Group Company" means a company that is a member of the same group as the Landlord within the meaning of Section 42 of the 1954 Act
See clause 5.9.11.
It is in fact surprising that landlords are prepared to allow occupation of premises by members of the same group of companies as the tenant without a formal assignment, but needless to say it may be in the tenant's best interests to try to include this provision if it is not initially incorporated in the lease.
2.6 "Insurance Cost" means the sums that the Landlord shall from time to time pay by way of premium:
2.6.1 for insuring the Centre or (where such insurance includes the Centre and other premises) such proportion [reasonably]attributable to the Centre of the sums that the Landlord shall from time to time pay by way of premium for insuring the Centre and other premises to be determined from time to time by the Surveyor acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator
It is conceivable that the landlord may insure the centre with other premises in its ownership under a block policy.
2.6.2 for insuring in such amount and on such terms as [the Landlord shall consider appropriate or shall be reasonable]against all liability of the Landlord to third parties arising out of or in connection with any matter involving or relating to the Centre
The option as to reasonableness is very much preferred.
2.7 "Insurance Rent" means:
2.7.1 the Insurance Rent Percentage of the Insurance Cost and
2.7.2 all of any increased premium payable by any act or omission of the Tenant
This is self-explanatory, but clause 2.7.2 should be carefully noted by the tenant.
2.8 "Insured Risks" means fire [lightning explosion aircraft (including articles dropped from aircraft) riot civil commotion malicious persons earthquake storm tempest flood bursting and overflowing of water pipes tanks and other  apparatus and impact by road vehicles]and such other risks as the Landlord from time to time in [its]absolute discretion may think fit to insure against
It is essential to ensure that the risks to be covered by the insurance policy are sufficient to cover the main eventualities.
This would normally be the position under current standard policies but there is no harm in setting out the principal risks.
Some risks may not be appropriate or may increase the premium unreasonably or unnecessarily.
The tenant should nevertheless consider whether it wishes the specified risks to include subsidence, the sprinkler system (if any), aerial devices other than aircraft and impact other than road vehicles, among others.
Unless the landlord is prepared to agree that the insurance should be in the joint names of the landlord and tenant, which is unlikely as the landlord would wish to keep control of the policy and proceeds, the tenant should ensure that either the landlord will act reasonably in deciding which other risks it may wish to insure against, or that the tenant will also have the right to nominate risks.
The reference to "or" such other risks should be amended to "and in addition to the foregoing" in order to make it clear that the landlord is not given the choice which of the stated risks it may choose to insure against—perhaps an obvious point but one worth making.
The latter part of the clause should therefore be amended as follows:
and in addition to the foregoing such other risks as the Landlord from time to time in its reasonable discretion may think fit to insure against or against which the Tenant may reasonably request the Landlord to insure
2.9 "Interest" means interest during the period from the date on which the payment is due to the date of payment both before and after any judgment at the Interest Rate then prevailing or should the base rate referred to in clause 1.8 cease to exist such other rate of interest as is most closely comparable with the Interest Rate to be agreed between the parties or in default of agreement to be determined by the Accountant acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator
This is not an unreasonable provision, and even though the accountant may be an appointee of the landlord, one would expect him to act fairly.
2.10 "the 1954 Act" means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954  [and all statutes regulations and orders included by virtue of clause 3.16]
It is as well to include the words in square brackets to ensure that subsequent amendments to the Act are taken into account, eg the Law of Property Act 1969.
2.11 "Pipes" means all pipes sewers drains mains ducts conduits gutters watercourses wires cables channels flues and all other conducting media and includes any fixings louvres cowls and any other ancillary apparatus
This may require amendment depending upon the premises being demised.
2.12 "the Plan" means the plan annexed to this Lease
In all cases the premises ought to be defined by reference to a plan, probably stated to be for identification purposes only unless the plan is supposed to take precedence over the verbal description of the premises.
2.13 "the Planning Acts" means the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 [and all statutes regulations and orders included by virtue of clause 3.16]
Apart from the fact that the 1971 Act has been superseded by the 1990 Act, it is likely that this definition will also be extended to include any or all of the following Acts:
The Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the Planning (Consequential Provisions) Act 1990, the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990 and the Planning and Compensation Act 1991.
2.14 "Rent" means the Initial Rent and rent ascertained in accordance with the fourth Schedule and such term includes neither the Insurance Rent nor the Service Charge but the term "rents" includes Rent the Insurance and the Service Charge See under clause 4 as to the reservation of the insurance rent and the service charge as rents.
2.15 "Retained Parts" means all parts of the Centre not let or constructed or adapted for letting including (but without prejudice to the generality of the above):
2.15.1 the Common Parts 
2.15.2 office accommodation for the Centre manager and ancillary staff
2.15.3 a central control station for any security system operating throughout the Centre
2.15.4 any nursery premises provided for the benefit of persons using the Centre generally
2.15.5 any public lavatories provided for the benefit of persons using the Centre generally
2.15.6 any staff rooms and storage premises used in connection with the provisions of services for the Centre
2.15.7 all Pipes equipment and apparatus used in the Centre (except such as are within and solely serve an individual unit which is let or constructed or adapted for letting)
2.15.8 the plant rooms ducts walkways channels and other areas which house or contain the items described in clause 2.15.7 and
2.15.9 such parts of the main structure walls foundations and roofs of the Centre that are not included in the Premises and that would not be included in the Premises demised by the Leases of all the other units in the Centre if let on the same terms as this Lease
This needs very careful consideration depending upon the composition of the centre.
The tenant does not want to find itself paying a proportion of the service charge (which may include rates) of unlet units.
The exclusion of parts of the centre "let or constructed or adapted for letting" is fair and reasonable, but quite often an exclusion will relate only to parts of the centre "not let on the same terms as this lease" which could result in the occupying tenants paying part of the service charges for unlet premises.
2.16 "the Shop Covenants" means the covenants set out in the fifth Schedule
2.17 "surveyor" means any person or firm appointed by or acting for the Landlord (including an employee of the Landlord or a Group Company and including also the person or firm appointed by the Landlord to collect the rents) to perform any of the functions of the Surveyor under this Lease
As with the accountant the person performing the function of the surveyor should be professionally qualified and the following proviso should be added: Provided that the person who purports to act as the Surveyor must be an Associate or Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or an Associate or Fellow of the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers 
3 Interpretations
3.1 The expressions "the Landlord" and "the Tenant" wherever the context so admits include the person for the time being entitled to the reversion immediately expectant on the determination of the Term and the Tenant's successors in title respectively and any reference to a superior Landlord includes the Landlord's immediate reversioner (and any superior Landlords) at any time
This is self-explanatory.
3.2 Where the Landlord the Tenant or the Guarantor for the time being are two or more persons obligations expressed or implied to be made by or with such party are deemed to be by or with such persons jointly and severally
Quite often the landlord will attempt to avoid this provision applying to itself and this should be resisted.
3.3 Words importing one gender include all other genders and words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa This proviso is unobjectionable and requires no comment.
3.4 The expression "Guarantor" includes not only the person referred to in clause 1.1.3 (if any) but also any person who enters into covenants with the Landlord pursuant to clauses 5.9.5 or 5.23
If there is no initial guarantor the tenant may object to the inclusion of clause 8 despite the fact that guarantor's covenants may become necessary on an assignment.
In such circumstances, it is possible to include the guarantor's covenants in a schedule.
3.5 The expression "the Centre" where the context so admits includes any additional and adjoining land and buildings in which during the Term the Landlord or a Group Company shall have acquired the freehold or leasehold interest and  which shall have been so constructed or acquired to form [an integral]part of the Centre
It is important from the landlord's point of view to ensure that the centre does not expand where the tenant has been given a fixed service charge percentage, unless provisions are inserted in the lease to countenance this.
3.6 Reference to "the Premises" in the absence of any provision to the contrary include any part of the Premises
This is perhaps implied, but there is certainly no harm in spelling it out.
3.7 Any part of the Premises that faces onto any of the Common Parts shall be regarded as an external part of the Premises notwithstanding that such part of the Common Parts is covered in and "exterior"  "external" and other words to similar effect shall be construed accordingly
This will need to be considered more specifically having regard to the physical aspects of the premises, common parts and the centre.
3.8 The expression "the Term" includes the Contractual Term and any period of holding-over or extension or continuance of the Contractual Term whether by statute or common law
This has significance not only for the tenant but also for any guarantor.
The case of City of London Corporation v Fell [1992]2 EG 172 came to the surprising conclusion that unless the lease provides otherwise (eg by providing that the original tenant's obligations will remain in place during a statutory tenancy), where the lease has been assigned and the present tenant is holding over, the original tenant's liability ends on the contractual term date.
As regards guarantors, in the absence of any contrary indication in the lease, a guarantee does not extend to a period after the expiry of the term of the lease where the tenancy is being extended under s 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.
3.9 References to "the last year of the Term" include the last year of the Term if the Term shall determine otherwise than by effluxion of time and references to "the expiration of the Term" include such other determination of the Term
This is self-explanatory.
3.10 References to any right of the Landlord to have access to the Premises shall be construed as extending to any superior Landlord and any mortgagee of the Premises and to all persons authorised by the Landlord and any superior Landlord or mortgagee (including agents professional advisers contractors workmen and others)[where such superior lease or mortgage grants such rights of access to the superior Landlord or mortgagee]
The words in square brackets should most definitely be included and in addition to avoid a continual stream of persons demanding access to the premises, the tenant may consider it advisable to add the following proviso at the end of this clause:
Provided that such persons shall have sufficient reason to require access to the Premises
3.11 Any covenant by the Tenant not to do an act or thing shall be deemed to include an obligation [to use reasonable endeavours]not to permit or suffer such act or thing to be done by another person [where the Tenant is aware that such act or thing is being done]
The words in square brackets should most definitely be included.
3.12 Any provisions in this Lease referring to the consent or approval of the Landlord shall be construed as also requiring the consent or approval of any mortgagee of the Premises and any superior Landlord where such consent shall be required but nothing in this Lease shall be construed as implying that any obligation is imposed upon any mortgagee or any superior Landlord not unreasonably to refuse any such consent or approval
Ideally, this provision should be deleted, or at the very least it should be amended so that it applies only to the consent of a mortgagee or superior landlord actually required under the terms of an existing mortgage or superior lease.
The clause should be amended to read as follows:
Any provisions in this Lease relating to the consent or approval of the Landlord shall be construed as also requiring the consent or approval of any existing mortgagee of the Premises and any existing superior Landlord where such consent or approval shall be required and the Landlord shall use all reasonable endeavours to obtain such consent or approval with all due expedition 
3.13 Reference to "consent of the Landlord" or words to similar effect mean a consent in writing signed by or on behalf of the Landlord and to "approved" and "authorised" or words to similar effect mean (as the case may be) approved or authorised in writing by or on behalf of the Landlord
This is self-explanatory.
3.14 The terms "the parties" or "party" means the Landlord and/or
the Tenant but except where there is an express indication to the contrary exclude the Guarantor
It is better to exclude the guarantor as one of the parties to the lease to avoid problems where the lease contains reference to "the consent of the parties" thereby including the guarantor.
3.15 "Development" has the meaning given by the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 section 22
This would now be a reference to s 55 of the 1990 Act.
3.16 Any references to a specific statute include any statutory extension or modification amendment or re-enactment of such statute and any regulations or orders made under such statute and any general reference to "statute" or "statutes" includes any regulations or orders made under such statute or statutes
The problem with this provision is that it could apply to such orders as the 1987 Order referred to in clause 1.10, hence the suggested interpolation in that clause.
3.17 Reference in this Lease to any clause sub-clause or Schedule without further designation shall be construed as a reference to the clause sub-clause or Schedule to this Lease so numbered
3.18 The clause paragraph and Schedule headings [and the table of contents]do not form part of this Lease and shall not be taken into account in its construction or interpretation
It may also be advisable to insert the following additional clause:
3.19 References in this Lease to any rights granted to the Tenant shall be construed as being granted to the Tenant and any undertenant or undertenants and all persons  authorised by the Tenant or any undertenant or undertenants to exercise such rights 
Demise
Introduction
This clause formally demises the premises to the tenant, referring to the rights to be granted with the demise and to the exceptions and reservations in favour of the landlord.
It also sets out the term to be granted and the rents payable.
4 Demise
The Landlord demises to the Tenant the Premises Together with the rights specified in the second Schedule but Excepting and reserving to the Landlord the rights specified in the third Schedule To hold the Premises to the Tenant for the Contractual Term Subject to all rights easements privileges restrictions covenants and stipulations of whatever nature affecting the Premises [including the matters contained or referred to in the seventh Schedule]Yielding and paying to the Landlord:
4.1 the Rent payable without any deduction by equal quarterly payments in advance on the usual quarter days in every year and proportionately for any period of less than a year the first such payment being a proportionate sum in respect of the period from and including the Rent Commencement Date to and including the day before the quarter day next after the Rent Commencement Date to be paid on the date of this Lease and
4.2 by way of further rent the Insurance Rent payable on demand in accordance with clause 7 and the Service Charge payable in accordance with the sixth Schedule
Comments on the rights, exceptions and reservations are included under the second and third schedules.
The words of whatever nature affecting the Premises including the matters should be deleted so that, in the words of the note to the precedent, the schedule becomes comprehensive rather than illustrative.
An interesting point is that the words "yielding and paying" actually imply a covenant to pay the rent, but it is more usual to have a specific tenant's covenant in this regard.
The reference to the rent being payable without any deduction is to avoid the tenant attempting to set off expenses or payments due from the landlord against the rent.
There may, however, be instances where the tenant is obliged to make deductions, eg tax payable to the Inland Revenue where the landlord is non-resident and the following amendment to clause 4.1 may therefore be advisable:
without any deduction (except where lawfully made pursuant to statute)
Present day rent free periods can be up to a year or even longer, and the tenant will not wish to make the first payment of rent on the date of the lease where the Rent Commencement Date is 12 months hence.
This clause should be amended to provide that the first rent payment will be due on the Rent Commencement Date.
It is a question of negotiation as to whether the insurance rent and the service charge, and any other payments for that matter, are reserved by way of rent, and the tenant may initially wish to challenge this.
The landlord will usually prefer such a reservation in order to utilise the remedy of distress for arrears, and to forfeit the lease without the necessity to serve a notice under s 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925, which would otherwise apply if these payments were merely tenant's covenants.
Having said that, the landlord may accept that there is more certainty in serving a s 146 notice with a short period of notice, leading to re-entry, rather than to run the risk that the tenant may subsequently utilise the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 which permits the tenant to apply for relief for up to six months after judgment in respect of forfeiture for arrears of rent.
A comment on the implications of s 56 of the Stamp Act 1891 is set out in the Appendix.
Tenant's Covenants
Introduction
As landlords' solicitors become ever wary that they should leave nothing to chance, the number of individual tenant's covenants appear to be increasing with heavyweight commercial leases quite often having comfortably in excess of 30 covenants and not far short of 50.
It is therefore quite impossible to suggest amendments to all permutations of the obligations currently being imposed on tenants, but the tenant's adviser should be watchful for new variations on an old theme and indeed for innovative covenants which could cause the tenant a good deal of anxiety.
The problem is that most tenant's covenants appear at the outset to be quite reasonable and innocuous, but if a week is a long time in politics then 25 years is a lifetime in property during which circumstances can and will change with a result that a previously innocent-looking covenant could become highly restrictive and troublesome.
The following comments and suggested amendments are offered in respect of the precedent:
5 The tenant's covenants
The Tenant covenants with the Landlord:
5.1 Rent
5.1.1 to pay the rents on the days and in the manner set out in this Lease and not to exercise or seek to exercise any right or claim to withhold rent or any right or claim to legal or equitable set-off
5.1.2 if so required in writing by the Landlord to make such payments by banker's order or credit transfer to any bank  and account [in the United Kingdom]that the Landlord may from time to time nominate There may be occasions where the tenant would wish to withhold rent or claim a set-off and while the point is worth negotiating, clause 5.1.1 is otherwise not unreasonable.
Any reference to payment of rent by banker's order or credit transfer should be vigorously contested.
The landlord's argument will be that the rent should be paid on time, but the tenant could respond that it is a fairly recent innovation for rent to be paid in advance as opposed to in arrears and, furthermore, that the landlord has the benefit of three months' rent in advance, despite the fact that it may not arrive on the actual quarter day.
In addition, most company tenants will have a standard mechanism for payment of rent and will not be geared up to make exceptions to cover these particular lease arrangements.
It is in fact also suggested that there are dangers for a landlord in this clause in that the acceptance of rent by the bank after a breach of covenant by the tenant could waive the breach.
Clause 5.1.2 should therefore be deleted.
5.2 Outgoings and VAT To pay and indemnify the Landlord against:
5.2.1 all rates taxes assessments duties charges impositions and outgoings which are now or during the Term shall be charged assessed or imposed upon the Premises or upon the owner or occupier of them [excluding any payable by the Landlord occasioned by receipt of the rents or by any disposition of dealing with or ownership of any interest reversionary to the interest created by this Lease][and if the Landlord shall suffer any loss of rating relief which may be applicable to empty premises after the end of the Term by reason of such relief being allowed to the Tenant in respect of any period before the end of the Term to make good such loss to the Landlord]and
5.2.2 VAT (or any tax of a similar nature that may be substituted for it or levied in addition to it) chargeable in respect of any payment made by the Tenant under any of the terms of or in connection with this Lease or in respect of any payment made by the Landlord where the Tenant agrees in this Lease to reimburse the Landlord for such payment  The tenant should insure that there is excluded from the tenant's liability any taxes properly payable by the landlord both in respect of rents received and the landlord's dealings with the reversionary interest.
In the case of an underlease there should also be excluded rents and outgoings payable by the landlord under its own lease.
Reference to the loss of rating relief should be deleted.
This arises where the tenant has closed the premises prior to the end of the term and has used up the full entitlement to rating relief.
In most cases the tenant will only close the premises if the tenant's business is unprofitable, and therefore the last thing the tenant wants is then to have to reimburse the landlord for the landlord's loss of rating relief.
See comments post with regard to VAT.
5.3 Electricity gas and other services consumed To pay to the suppliers and to indemnify the Landlord against all charges for electricity gas and other services consumed or used at or in relation to the Premises (including meter rents) In a footnote to the precedent it is stated that this clause is possibly superfluous in the case of a separate building as the tenant would make arrangements for a separate supply to be provided to the premises, but there is no objection to its inclusion.
5.4 Repair and cleaning
5.4.1 To repair the Premises and keep them in repair excepting damage caused by an Insured Risk other than where the insurance money is irrecoverable in consequence of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority [and under the Tenant's control]
5.4.2 To replace from time to time the Landlord's fixtures and fittings in the Premises which may be or become beyond repair at any time during or at the expiration of the Term
5.4.3 To clean the Premises and keep them in a clean neat and tidy condition and (without prejudice to the generality of the above) to clean both sides of all windows and window frames in the Premises [at least[once]every [week]or as often as is [reasonably]necessary]It is quite easy to devote a whole chapter to the subject of repair and the Law Commission has recently published a consultation paper on the state and condition of leasehold property with a view to considering existing obligations and how the law can be improved with regard to them.
Perhaps the best definition of repair was that given by Buckley LJ in Lurcott v Wakely & Wheeler [1911]1 KB 905: "repair is restoration by renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole.
Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole but substantially the whole".
It is also worthwhile to bear in mind the standard of repair which it was stated in Proudfoot v Hart (1890) 25 QB 42 would have to take into account the age, character and locality of property.
The case is also authority for the fact that if the premises are out of repair at the commencement of the term then the tenant would be under an obligation to repair them.
 "To put in repair" is sometimes used and imposes no greater obligation than "to repair" any more than to keep "in repair" , "in good repair" , "in sufficient repair" or "in tenantable repair" (Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe v McOscar [1924]1 KB 716).
The tenant may wish to limit its liability to the state and condition of the premises at the commencement of the term, in which case it would need to include a provision that it will keep the Premises in no worse condition than they are in at the commencement of the Term as evidenced by the Schedule of condition annexed hereto A schedule of condition would then of course have to be settled including, if possible, a portfolio of photographs.
A reference to damage caused by the insured risks (as defined) should be excepted and the tenant may wish to reduce the number of people for whom the tenant may be vicariously liable.
The precedent suggests a reference to persons under the Tenant's control in order to exclude mere callers, but where the clause refers to servants of the tenant (which some precedents do despite the archaic nature of the expression) it may be as well to qualify this with the words in the course of employment  in case it is claimed that a servant will, by the nature of the expression, always be under the tenant's control.
The tenant may wish to avoid responsibility for structural or inherent defects, ie the rectification of faults in the design or construction of a building which may otherwise be passed on to the tenant by virtue of the general effect of a tenant's covenant to repair.
An exclusion of structural or inherent defects may be a starting point, although it could be suggested that the expression "inherent defect" has no clear meaning and that the exemption of the tenant from such liability may, from the landlord's point of view, make serious inroads into a full repairing liability.
The exception may nevertheless be worthwhile making to see what the landlord will offer as a compromise.
The tenant should in addition endeavour to obtain collateral warranties/duty of care agreements from, inter alia, the designers and constructors of the premises.
There is no objection to the replacement of the landlord's fixtures and fittings from time to time or to cleaning the premises and the windows, provided that the latter is not too frequent.
Clause 5.4.1 could therefore be amended as follows:
5.4.1 To repair the Premises and keep them in repair excepting damage caused by structural or inherent defects or by an Insured Risk other than where the insurance money is irrecoverable in consequence of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority (but only while under the Tenant's control and in the course of employment) Provided that where the insurance money is not wholly irrecoverable such sums as are recoverable shall be made available as soon as possible to apply to the repair of the Premises
5.5 Decoration [As often as may in the [reasonable]opinion of the Surveyor be necessary in order to maintain a high standard of decorative finish and attractiveness and to preserve the Premises or In each of the Decorating Years]and in the last year of the Term to redecorate the Premises in a good and workmanlike manner and with appropriate materials  of good quality [to the [reasonable]satisfaction of the Surveyor]the tints and colours and patterns of such decoration to be approved by the Landlord [provided that the covenants relating to the last year of the Term shall not apply where the Tenant shall have redecorated the Premises less than [18]months prior to the expiry of the Term]Most tenants would not wish to be under an obligation to redecorate the interior or exterior of the premises more frequently than every five years, although this is a matter for negotiation.
The landlord may wish to have some control over the external colour scheme, but the tenant should resist a provision for the landlord's consent to the internal colour scheme, except perhaps in the last year of the term where the tenant does not propose to seek a renewal.
It is also important to ensure that the tenant should not have to redecorate more than once in any one year and that while there is no objection to paints and materials being of "good quality" they should not be of the "best" quality.
Also, a small point but one worth making, is that two coats of paint should suffice with today's quality of paint.
5.6 Aerials signs and advertisements Not to erect any pole mast or wire (whether in connection with telegraphic telephonic radio or television communication or otherwise) upon the Premises It may be that the nature of the tenant's business necessitates an aerial being erected and therefore the following amendment should be made: Not without the previous consent in writing of the Landlord (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to erect any pole mast or wire
5.7 Statutory obligations
5.7.1 At the Tenant's own expense to execute all works and provide and maintain all arrangements upon or in respect of the Premises or the use to which the Premises are being put that are required in order to comply with the requirements of any statute (already or in the future to be passed) or any government department, local authority other  public or competent authority or court of competent jurisdiction regardless of whether such requirements are imposed on the lessor the lessee or the occupier
5.7.2 Not to do in or near the Premises any act or thing by reason of which the Landlord may under any statute incur have imposed upon [it]or become liable to pay any penalty damages compensation costs charges or expenses
5.7.3 Without prejudice to the generality of the above to comply in all respects with the provisions of any statutes and other obligations imposed by law or by any byelaws applicable to the Premises or in regard to carrying on the trade or business for the time being carried on on the Premises It may be that clause 5.7.1 should, in certain circumstances, have the following proviso added: except where such compliance is within the ambit of the Landlord's obligations contained in this Lease Almost all leases will contain a tenant's covenant to comply with statutory obligations, which could involve fairly substantial capital expenditure.
An example would be the installation of a sprinkler system that was forced on the tenant by the local fire authority.
The interrelationship of this clause with the rent review clause should be considered.
The point is that there may not be disregarded on rent review under the lease the cost to the tenant of carrying out work under this clause as it will have been effected pursuant to an obligation to the landlord.
It is possible and indeed advisable to stipulate in the rent review clause for such works to be disregarded see fourth Schedule paragraph 1.4.3—but the works will not be disregarded on a renewal under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954
It has been suggested that where a tenant has had to make substantial alterations the court may force the landlord to make a contribution, but this is not to be relied upon.
5.8 Access of Landlord and notice to repair
5.8.1 To permit the Landlord:
5.8.1.1 to enter upon the Premises for the purpose of ascertaining that the covenants and conditions of this Lease have been observed and performed
5.8.1.2 to view (and to open up floors and of other parts of the Premises where such opening-up is required in order to view) the state of repair and condition of the Premises and 
5.8.1.3 to give to the Tenant (or leave upon the Premises) a notice specifying any repairs cleaning maintenance or painting that the Tenant has failed to execute in breach of the terms of this Lease and to request the Tenant immediately to execute the same including the making good of such opening-up (if any) provided that any such opening-up shall be made good by and at the cost of the Landlord where such opening up reveals no breaches of the terms of this Lease
5.8.2 Immediately to repair cleanse maintain and paint the Premises as required by such notice [5.8.3 If within [one month]of the service of such a notice the Tenant shall not have commenced and be proceeding diligently with the execution of the work referred to in the notice or shall fail to complete the work within [2]months [or if in the Landlord's [Surveyor's][reasonable]opinion the Tenant is unlikely to have completed the work within such period]to permit the Landlord to enter the Premises to execute such work as may be necessary to comply with the notice and to pay to the Landlord the cost of so doing and all expenses incurred by the Landlord (including legal costs and Surveyor's fees) within [14]days of a written demand]While it is recognised that the landlord should have the right to enter the premises from time to time to ensure that the tenant's covenants have been complied with, this clause could cause severe disruption to the tenant's business and should be amended accordingly.
The tenant will wish to have prior notice of such entry and the draftsman of the precedent has suggested an amendment to the commencement of the clause to cover this.
The landlord may indeed wish to open up floors and other parts of the premises in connection with inspections, but such works would have a quite catastrophic effect on the tenant's business and should therefore be resisted.
If the landlord insists on the provision remaining then he should be prepared to pay compensation to the tenant for loss of business if the opening up reveals nothing untoward.
Initially, however, the tenant should insist on deletion of the provision.
The tenant should be careful also not to agree a too restrictive period of time in which to carry out remedial works.
The draftsman of the precedent suggests the substitution of: within a reasonable period for 2 months which seems a fair compromise.
By reserving a right for the landlord to carry out the works in the event of the tenant's default, the landlord does in fact run a slight risk pursuant to s 4(4) of the Defective Premises Act 1972 but the risk is small compared to the relative advantage of the re-entry provision.
Clause 5.8 should be amended to read as follows:
5.8 Access of Landlord and notice to repair
5.8.1 To permit the Landlord upon reasonable notice during normal business hours except in the case of emergency:
5.8.1.1 to enter upon the Premises for the purpose of ascertaining that the covenants and conditions of this Lease have been observed and performed
5.8.1.2 to view the state of repair and condition of the Premises and
5.8.1.3 to give to the Tenant (or leave upon the Premises) a notice specifying any repairs cleaning maintenance or painting that the Tenant has failed to execute in breach of the terms of this Lease and to request the Tenant immediately to execute the same
5.8.2 As soon as reasonably practicable (or immediately in the case of emergency) to repair cleanse maintain and paint the Premises as required by such notice
5.8.3 If within two months of the service of such a notice the Tenant shall not have commenced and be proceeding diligently with the execution of the work referred to in the notice or shall fail to complete the work within a reasonable period to permit the Landlord to enter the Premises to execute such work as may be necessary to comply with the notice and to pay to the Landlord the proper and necessary costs of so doing and all necessary expenses incurred by the Landlord (including reasonable and proper legal costs and surveyor's fees) within 28 days of a written demand.
5.9 Alienation
5.9.1 Not to hold on trust for another or (save pursuant to a transaction permitted by and effected in accordance with the provisions of this Lease) part with the possession of the whole or any part of the Premises or permit another to occupy the whole or any part of the Premises
5.9.2 Not to assign [underlet]or charge part only of the Premises [and not to underlet the whole or any part of the Premises]
5.9.3 Not to assign [underlet]or charge the whole of the Premises without the prior consent of the Landlord such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
5.9.4 Prior to any permitted assignment to procure that the assignee enters into direct covenants with the Landlord to perform and observe all the Tenant's covenants and all other provisions during the residue of the Term
5.9.5 On a permitted assignment to a limited company and if the Landlord shall [reasonably]so require to procure that at least[2]directors of the company or some other guarantor or guarantors [reasonably]acceptable to the Landlord enter into direct covenants with the Landlord in the form of the Guarantor's covenant contained in this Lease with "the Assignee" substituted for "the Tenant" [5.9.6 That each and every permitted underlease shall be granted without any fine or premium at a rent not less than the then open market rental value of the Premises [to be approved by the Landlord prior to any such underlease][and to be determined by the Surveyor acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator]or the Rent then being paid (whichever shall be the greater) such rent being payable in advance on the days on which Rent is payable under this Lease and shall contain provisions approved by the Landlord:
5.9.6.1 for the upwards only review of the rent reserved by such underlease on the basis and on the dates on which the Rent is to be reviewed in this Lease
5.9.6.2 prohibiting the undertenant from doing or allowing any act or thing in relation to the underlet Premises inconsistent with or in breach of the provisions of this Lease
5.9.6.3 for re-entry by the underlandlord on breach of any covenants by the undertenant
5.9.6.4 imposing an absolute prohibition against all dispositions of or other dealings whatever with the Premises other than an assignment [underletting][or charge]of the whole 
5.9.6.5 prohibiting any assignment [underletting][or charge]of the whole without the prior consent of the Landlord under this Lease
5.9.6.6 prohibiting the undertenant from permitting another to occupy the whole or any part of the Premises
5.9.6.7 imposing in relation to any permitted assignment [underletting][or charge]the same obligations for registration with the Landlord as are contained in this Lease in relation to dispositions by the Tenant and
5.9.6.8 imposing in relation to any permitted underletting the same obligations as contained in clause 5.9.6 and in clause[s] 5.9.7 [5.9.8 and 5.9.9]][5.9.7 Prior to any permitted underletting to procure that the undertenant enters into direct covenants with the Landlord to the like effect as those contained in clauses 5.9.6 [and]5.9.7 [5.9.8 and 5.9.9]][5.9.8 To enforce the performance and observance by every such undertenant of the provisions of the underlease and not at any time either expressly or by implication to waive any breach of the covenants or conditions on the part of any undertenant or assignee of any underlease nor (without the consent of the Landlord such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) vary the terms or accept a surrender of any permitted underlease][5.9.9 In relation to any permitted underlease:
5.9.9.1 to ensure that the rent is reviewed in accordance with the terms of the underlease
5.9.9.2 not to agree the reviewed rent with the undertenant without the approval of the Landlord
5.9.9.3 where the underlease provides such an option not to agree that the third party determining the rent in default of agreement shall act as an arbitrator or as an expert without the approval of the Landlord
5.9.9.4 not to agree upon the appointment of a person to act as the third party determining the rent in default of agreement without the approval of the Landlord
5.9.9.5 to incorporate as part of [its]submissions or representations to that third party such submissions or representations as the Landlord shall [reasonably]require
5.9.9.6 to give notice to the Landlord of the details of the determination of every rent review within [28]days  provided that the Landlord's approval specified above shall not be unreasonably withheld [or delayed]]
5.9.10 Within [28]days of any assignment charge underlease or sub-underlease or any transmission or other devolution relating to the Premises to produce for registration with the Landlord's solicitor such deed or document [or a certified copy of it]and to pay the Landlord's solicitor's [charges of [£20 (twenty pounds)]for the registration of every such document or reasonable charges for the registration of every such document such charges not being less than [£20 (twenty pounds)]][5.9.11 Notwithstanding clause 5.9.1 the Tenant may share the occupation of the whole or any part of the Premises with a company which is a member of the same group as the Tenant (within the meaning of Section 42 of the 1954 Act) for so long as both companies shall remain members of that group and otherwise than in a manner that transfers or creates a legal estate]On the one hand, the tenant will wish to deal with the premises in the most cost effective manner, even if this means subletting parts and, on the other hand, the landlord will wish to exercise fairly strict control over alienation, first by ensuring that any assignee is able to pay the rents reserved by the lease and perform the tenant's obligations under it, and second by ensuring that at the end of the term the landlord is not left with a subtenant of a small part of the premises, which could affect the value of the landlord's interest in the whole.
In the unlikely event that there are no restrictions in the lease prohibiting alienation, the tenant will be free to deal with the premises as it so wishes, whether by means of assignment, underletting, charge or otherwise.
It should also be remembered that s 19(l) (a) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 provides that where there is a covenant, condition or agreement against assigning, underletting, charging or parting with possession of the premises or any part thereof without licence or consent, this is deemed to be subject to a proviso to the effect that such licence or consent is not to be unreasonably withheld.
This is a most useful provision that has come to the assistance of many tenants over the years.
Some alienation provisions contain surrender-back clauses which should be strongly resisted by the tenant, as they lead to  uncertainty as to whether the tenant will be permitted to assign the lease to the person of its choosing, and unless carefully worded could result in the tenant obtaining less from the landlord on surrender than it would have done from the assignee.
The following provisions should be noted in particular: As regards 5.9.1, many company tenants do not like a restriction on holding on trust for another as this may interfere with their internal arrangements, but the landlord's concerns are understood in this regard.
Some premises are not given to be divided and therefore an absolute prohibition on subletting or charging of part may be appropriate and acceptable.
By virtue of the doctrine of privity of estate the assignee will be liable to the landlord only for breaches of covenant occurring while the lease is vested in it, and that is why a landlord will usually insist upon a direct covenant from the assignee to observe and perform the provisions of the lease during the residue of the term, as in clause 5.9.4.
As the original tenant will in any event have a continuing liability under the lease the tenant may not consider it totally unreasonable for its assignee to have a similar liability.
The landlord will frequently require a guarantor or guarantors for an assignee and while the tenant may wish to have absolute control as to whether this is reasonable, the fact is that as the tenant will have a continuing liability throughout the lease, it is in the tenant's best interests for the assignee to supply a guarantor or guarantors wherever there may be some doubt as to the quality of the assignee's financial covenant.
In such an event the guarantor should give covenants not only to the landlord but also to the tenant.
It may be that with a rent well into six figures it is unrealistic to expect directors to give guarantees and therefore the following amendment may be considered appropriate:
5.9.5 On a permitted assignment to a private limited company and if the Landlord shall reasonably so require to procure that a guarantor or guarantors reasonably acceptable to the Landlord enter into direct covenants with the Landlord in the form of the Guarantor's covenant contained in this Lease with "the Assignee" substituted for "the Tenant" There are various matters to be considered in connection with a permitted underlease (not the least of which being as to whether the tenant should be allowed to underlet part or parts of the premises as well as to whole), eg:(1) In respect of any permitted underlease it is better to remove reference to the landlord's approval of the rent reserved by it, and if possible (particularly in a falling market) to remove reference to the rent being no less than the passing rent under the lease, although the landlord will normally object to this on the basis that a low underlease rent could be used as a comparable on any subsequent rent review under the lease.
The landlord may also express concern that on a forfeiture of the lease the undertenant may try to seek relief from forfeiture under s 146(4) of the Law of Property Act 1925 at a rent less than the lease rent.
(2) The tenant may contemplate more frequent rent reviews under the underlease than those in the lease although it is accepted that the rent review dates should otherwise coincide.
(3) The tenant should resist a provision not to agree the reviewed rent under the underlease without the landlord's approval, as the time it could take to obtain such approval could result in the undertenant changing its mind.
Similarly the tenant should resist the landlord's interference in the appointment of the independent valuer. (4) The registration of dealings clause should be amended to ensure that the original disposition does not have to be produced to the landlord: a certified copy is perfectly adequate.
Furthermore, while nobody would deny the landlord's solicitor a reasonable fee for the registration of dealings, care should be had to ensure that the registration charge is kept within reason.
Clauses 5.9.6 to 5.9.11 could be amended as follows:[5.9.6 That each and every permitted underlease shall be granted without any fine or premium at a rent not less than the then open market rental value of [the Premises][that part of the Premises to be underlet]such rent being payable in advance on the days on which Rent is payable under this Lease and shall contain provisions:
5.9.6.1 for the upwards only review of the rent reserved by such underlease on the basis and at least on the dates on which the Rent is to be reviewed in this Lease (but having regard to the length of the proposed term of the underlease)
5.9.6.2 prohibiting the undertenant from doing or allowing any act or thing in relation to the underlet Premises inconsistent with or in breach of the provisions of this Lease 
5.9.6.3 for re-entry by the underlandlord on breach of any covenants by the undertenant 5.9.6.4imposing an absolute prohibition against all dispositions of or other dealings whatever with the Premises other than an assignment [or underletting]of the whole (This is of course subject to negotiation.)
5.9.6.5 prohibiting any assignment [or underletting]of the whole without the prior consent of the Landlord under this Lease (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
5.9.6.6 prohibiting the undertenant from permitting another to occupy the whole or any part of the Premises (otherwise than as permitted in this clause 5.9)
5.9.6.7 imposing in relation to any permitted assignment [or underletting]the same obligations for registration with the Landlord as are contained in this Lease in relation to dispositions by the Tenant and
5.9.6.8 imposing in relation to any permitted underletting the same obligations in clause 5.9.6 and in clause[s] 5.9.7 [5.9.8 and 5.9.9]][5.9.7 Prior to any permitted underletting to procure that the undertenant enters into direct covenants with the Landlord to the like effect as those contained in clauses 5.9.6 [and]5.9.7 [5.9.8 and 5.9.9]][5.9.8 To enforce the performance and observance by every such undertenant of the provisions of the underlease and not at any time either expressly or by implication to waive any breach of the covenants or conditions on the part of any undertenant or assignee of any underlease nor (without the consent of the Landlord such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) vary the terms of any permitted underlease][5.9.9 In relation to any permitted underlease to ensure that the rent is reviewed in accordance with the terms of the underlease]
5.9.10 Within [28]days of any assignment charge underlease or sub-underlease or any transmission or other devolution relating to the Premises to produce for registration with the Landlord's solicitor such deed or document [or a certified copy of it]and to pay the Landlord's solicitor's [charges of [£20 (twenty pounds)]for the registration  of every such document or reasonable charges for the registration of every such document such charges not being less than [£20 (twenty pounds)]][5.9.11 Notwithstanding clause 5.9.1 the Tenant may share the occupation of the whole or any part of the Premises with a company which is a member of the same group as the Tenant (within the meaning of Section 42 of the 1954 Act) for so long as both companies shall remain members of that group and otherwise than in a manner that transfers or creates a legal estate]As well as a joint occupation clause, the tenant should consider including a provision permitting the tenant to share the premises with franchisees where the premises are sufficiently large and the tenant's business could accommodate such trading operations, eg:
5.9.12 Notwithstanding clause 5.9.1 the Tenant may share the occupation of the whole or any part of the Premises with franchisees or concessionaires on terms which do not create the relationship of landlord and tenant between the Tenant and such franchisees or concessionaires provided that the Tenant shall give written notice to the Landlord within 21 days of the commencement and termination of such arrangements
5.10 Nuisance etc and residential restrictions
5.10.1 Not to do nor allow to remain upon the Premises anything which may be or become or cause a nuisance annoyance disturbance inconvenience injury or damage to the Landlord or [its]tenants or the owners or occupiers of adjacent or neighbouring premises
5.10.2 Not to use the Premises for a sale by auction or for any dangerous noxious noisy or offensive trade business manufacture or occupation nor for any illegal or immoral act or purpose
5.10.3 Not to use the Premises as sleeping accommodation or for residential purposes nor keep any animal fish reptile or bird anywhere on the Premises A tenant would find it difficult to resist a covenant against nuisance and the only objection to this clause is whether there should be a restriction against using the premises for a sale by auction.
This seems quite antiquated and unnecessary but it seems to appear in virtually all commercial leases and landlords' solicitors seem  reluctant to start a new trend by agreeing to its deletion.
Clause 5.10.3 may have to be amended where the premises comprise part business, part residential accommodation, eg high street shop with flats above.
5.11 Landlord's costs To pay to the Landlord on an indemnity basis all costs fees charges disbursements and expenses (including without prejudice to the generality of the above those payable to counsel solicitors surveyors and Bailiffs)[properly and reasonably]incurred by the Landlord in relation to or incidental to:
5.11.1 every application made by the Tenant for a consent or licence required by the provisions of this Lease whether such consent or licence is granted or refused or proffered subject to any [lawful]qualification or condition or whether the application is withdrawn [unless such refusal qualification or condition is unlawful whether because it is unreasonable or otherwise]
5.11.2 the preparation and service of a notice under the Law of Property Act 1925 section 146 or incurred by or in contemplation of proceedings under sections 146 or 147 of that Act notwithstanding that forfeiture is avoided otherwise than by relief granted by the court
5.11.3 the recovery or attempted recovery of arrears of rent or other sums due from the Tenant and
5.11.4 any steps taken in [contemplation of or in][direct]connection with the preparation and service of a Schedule of dilapidations during or after the expiration of the Term The costs charged to the tenant should be qualified by the word "reasonable" .
It is important to try to contain the scope of the costs that may be recoverable, eg whereas a surveyor's fees may be reasonable to seek to recover, it is arguable that it may not be reasonable for the landlord to instruct an architect in respect of the matters contemplated by this clause.
This is a fairly standard tenant's covenant and basically acceptable, although the following comments are worth noting: Despite the landlord's common law right to distress, some tenants object to the sight of a reference to bailiffs in leases and prefer it to be deleted.
There may also be good reason for deleting reference to the contemplation of proceedings under ss 146 or 147 of the Law of  Property Act 1925, as the costs recoverable under such a provision may not be easy for the tenant to assess and counter.
The clause could be amended as follows:
5.11 Landlord's costs To pay to the Landlord on an indemnity basis all reasonable costs fees charges disbursements and expenses (including without prejudice to the generality of the above those payable to solicitors and surveyors) properly and reasonably incurred by the Landlord in relation to or incidental to:
5.11.1 every application made by the Tenant for consent or licence required by the provisions of this Lease whether such consent or licence is granted or refused or proffered subject to any lawful qualification or condition or whether the application is withdrawn unless such refusal qualification or condition is unlawful whether because it is unreasonable or otherwise and unless such consent or licence is unreasonably refused
5.11.2 the preparation and service of a notice under the Law of Property Act 1925 section 146 or incurred in proceedings under sections 146 and 147 of that Act notwithstanding that forfeiture is avoided otherwise than by relief granted by the court
5.11.3 the recovery or attempted recovery of arrears of rent or other sums due from the Tenant and
5.11.4 any steps taken in direct connection with the preparation and service of a Schedule of dilapidations during or after the expiration of the Term but if after the expiration of the Term only in respect of wants of repair occurring during the Term and where served within three months after the expiration of the Term
5.12 The Planning Acts
5.12.1 Not to commit in relation to the Premises any breach of planning control (such term to be construed in the way in which it is used in the Planning Acts)
5.12.2 Not without the consent in writing of the Landlord to apply for planning permission to carry out any development in or upon the Premises and at the expense of the Tenant to supply the Landlord with a copy of any application for planning permission together with such plans  and other documents as the Landlord may [reasonably]require and to supply prior to the commencement of any development a copy of any planning permission granted to the Tenant
5.12.3 To pay and satisfy any charge that may be imposed upon any breach by the Tenant of planning control or otherwise under the Planning Acts
5.12.4 Unless the Landlord shall otherwise direct to carry out and complete before the expiry of the Term any works required to be carried out to or in the Premises as a condition of any planning permission which may have been granted during the Term irrespective of the date by which such works were required to be carried out It is understandable that a landlord will wish to ensure that the tenant not only complies with planning legislation but also does not make application for planning permission without the landlord's consent.
An application for a change of use for instance could, if successful, saddle the landlord with a detrimental use which may only be reconverted by another planning permission.
The tenant, however, will wish to make certain that the landlord's consent for an application for planning permission cannot be unreasonably withheld at least for certain specified matters, having regard to the nature and situation of the premises.
It may be a question of compromise between the landlord and the tenant but a general qualification is suggested as an initial amendment.
Some planning clauses require the tenant to appeal against the refusal of planning permission if the landlord so requires, quite often at the cost of the tenant.
This should be resisted as the tenant could find itself paying for the costs of an appeal it did not want to pursue.
The other point in this regard is that a requirement for the tenant to obtain the landlord's consent prior to making an application for planning permission could result in a considerable delay in the application being made in circumstances where the tenant requires the planning permission rather urgently, eg in connection with its fascia or signage, hence the amendment suggested below.
5.12.2 Not without the consent in writing of the Landlord (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which consent shall not be required in relation to applications in respect of the fascia or signage at the Premises) to apply for planning permission The landlord will probably insist on the retention of clause 5.12.4  in order to avoid the problem of a limited planning permission being issued containing a reinstatement provision becoming effective after the lease term has expired.
Some Planning Act covenants also include a provision for the tenant to provide security for compliance with planning permission conditions, which should be resisted wherever possible.
Large commercial tenants would not be greatly impressed by its inclusion and smaller tenants may have difficulty in providing the 'security"required.
A qualification that security need only be provided if the landlord reasonably so requires would be inadequate having regard to the non-immunity from failure of 'solid"commercial tenants in periods of recession.
In addition, any covenant requiring the tenant to appeal against a refusal of planning permission (particularly at the cost of the tenant) should be resisted as the tenant could find itself paying for the cost of the landlord appealing against a refusal of planning permission for the redevelopment of the premises at the end of term, where the tenant may wish to take a renewal of the lease.
5.13 Plans documents and information
5.13.1 If called upon to do so to produce to the Landlord or the Surveyor all plans documents and other evidence as the Landlord may [reasonably]require in order to satisfy [itself]that the provisions of this Lease have been complied with
5.13.2 If called upon to do so to furnish to the Landlord the Surveyor or any person acting as the third party determining the rent in default of agreement between the parties under any provisions for rent review contained in this Lease such information as may [reasonably]be requested in writing in relation to any pending or intended step under the 1954 Act or the implementation of any provisions for rent review This seems quite innocuous but an unreasonable landlord could become a nuisance and apart from ensuring that "reasonably" is included, the tenant should also begin each subclause as follows: If called upon to do so (but not more frequently than may be reasonable)
5.14 Indemnities To be responsible for and to keep the Landlord fully indemnified  against all damage damages losses costs expenses actions demands proceedings claims and liabilities made against or suffered or incurred by the Landlord arising directly or indirectly out of:
5.14.1 any act omission or negligence of the Tenant or any persons at the Premises expressly or impliedly with the Tenant's authority [and under the Tenant's control]or
5.14.2 any breach or non-observance by the Tenant of the covenants conditions or other provisions of this Lease or any of the matters to which this demise is subject The same point applies as above with regard to persons on the premises under the tenant's control.
It is suggested that the tenant should in fact attempt to delete this clause on the ground that the landlord is already protected by the other covenants contained in the lease and can take such action as may be necessary either for breach of contract or in tort.
This clause, it is suggested, could unfairly extend the tenant's liability.
If the clause is deleted, however, the landlord may argue for a covenant by the tenant to observe such restrictions to which the premises may be subject, with an indemnity for any breach.
It is probably better to retain the covenant, subject to the slight amendment referred to above.
5.15 Re-letting boards To permit the Landlord at any time during the last [6]months of the Contractual Term and at any time thereafter [unless the Tenant shall have made a valid court application under Section 24 of the 1954 Act or otherwise be entitled in law to remain in occupation or to a new tenancy of the Premises][(or sooner if the rents or any part of them shall be in arrear and unpaid for longer than [28]days)]to enter upon the Premises and affix and retain anywhere upon the Premises a notice for re-letting the Premises and during such period to permit persons with the written authority of the Landlord or [its]agent at reasonable times of the day to view the Premises It is not unreasonable for the landlord to be entitled to erect a re-letting board at the premises within a reasonable period prior to the termination of the term unless the tenant proposes to apply for a new tenancy of the premises, provided that the board is in a position so as not to interfere with the tenant's or any  undertenant's business being carried on at the premises.
The clause could be amended as follows: To permit the Landlord at any time during the last [6]months of the Contractual Term and at any time thereafter unless the Tenant shall have made a valid court application under Section 24 of the 1954 Act or otherwise be entitled in law to remain in occupation or to a new tenancy of the Premises to enter upon the Premises and affix and retain upon the Premises in a position so as not to interfere with the Tenant's or any undertenant's business being carried on at the Premises a notice for re-letting the Premises and during such period to permit persons with the written authority of the Landlord or its agent at reasonable times of the day on reasonable notice to view the Premises
5.16 Encroachments
5.16.1 Not to stop up darken or obstruct any windows or light belonging to the Premises
5.16.2 To take all [reasonable]steps to prevent any new window light opening doorway path passage pipe or other encroachment or easement being made or acquired in against out of or upon the Premises and to notify the Landlord immediately if any such encroachment or easement shall be made or acquired (or attempted to be made or acquired) and at the request of the Landlord to adopt such means as shall [reasonably]be required to prevent such encroachment or the acquisition of any such easement The landlord will wish to ensure that encroachments are prevented.
This clause is neither unusual nor unreasonable.
5.17 Yield up At the expiration of the Term:
5.17.1 to yield up the Premises in repair and in accordance with the terms of this Lease
5.17.2 to give up all keys of the Premises to the Landlord and
5.17.3 to remove all signs erected by the Tenant in upon or near the Premises and immediately to make good any damage caused by such removal It is advisable (at least for the purpose of this clause) for the tenant to ensure that the term includes any period of holding over or  continuation of the contractual term (as it does in this lease by virtue of clause 3.8) although it must be considered highly unlikely that the tenant would be forced to yield up the premises to the landlord during a continuation under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.
5.18 Interest on arrears
5.18.1 If the Tenant shall fail to pay the rents or any other sum due under this Lease [within [14]days of the date due]whether formally demanded or not the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord Interest on the rents or other sum from the date when they were due to the date on which they are paid [and such Interest shall be deemed to be rents due to the Landlord]
5.18.2 Nothing in the preceding clause shall entitle the Tenant to withhold or delay any payment of the rents or any other sum due under this Lease after the date upon which they fall due or in any way prejudice affect or derogate from the rights of the Landlord in relation to such non-payment including (but without prejudice to the generality of the above) under the proviso for re-entry contained in this Lease The period of grace before interest bites will be a matter of negotiation between the landlord and the tenant.
Fourteen days seems to be a fair and reasonable period, although a landlord will argue that the rent should be paid on the due date.
The tenant should resist a provision that interest should be deemed to be rent due to the landlord as this will have the effect of making available the remedy of distress as well as that of forfeiture without the necessity to serve a s 146 notice.
Relief will however be available for six months after judgment under the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 should this line be adopted.
Clause 5.18.2 is self-explanatory and reasonable.
5.19 Statutory notices etc To give full particulars to the Landlord of any notice direction order or proposal for the Premises made given or issued to the Tenant by any local or public authority within [7]days of receipt and if so required by the Landlord to produce it to the Landlord and without delay to take all  necessary steps to comply with the notice direction or order and at the request of the Landlord but at the cost of the Tenant to make or join with the Landlord in making such objections or representations against or in respect of any notice direction order or proposal as the Landlord shall deem expedient Seven days may be too short a period, particularly if the notice is served at the premises and not forwarded to the appropriate officer of a tenant company with any great alacrity.
Fourteen days would seem to be a more reasonable period though the landlord may be concerned that this could leave little time for it to make a considered response where the notice is subject to a time restriction.
It may not be in the tenant's best interests to make objections or representations and an amendment in this regard is suggested below.
The tenant should also endeavour to ensure that the cost of the landlord's objections or representations is borne by the landlord.
and at the request and cost of the Landlord to make or join with the Landlord in making such objections or representations against or in respect of any notice direction order or proposal as the Landlord shall reasonably deem expedient except where the Tenant reasonably considers that any such objections or representations are against its best interests or those of any undertenant
5.20 Keyholders To ensure that at all times the Landlord has [and the local Police force has]written notice of the name home address and home telephone number of at least[2]key holder[s] of the Premises While this is not necessarily objectionable it is a provision that is easily overlooked and imposes an obligation on the tenant which may not be appropriate in the circumstances.
It may be a clause that a particular tenant may prefer to delete unless other factors necessitate its inclusion.
5.21 Sale of reversion etc To permit [upon reasonable notice]at any time during the Term prospective purchasers of or agents instructed  in connection with the sale of the Landlord's reversion or of any other interest superior to the Term to view the Premises without interruption provided they are authorised in writing by the Landlord or its agents This is a normal provision and the only comment to make is that it could be disruptive to a tenant's business, although one would hope that the frequency of a sale of the reversion would be limited.
The words at reasonable times of the day should be inserted after the words to view the Premises
5.22 Defective premises To give notice to the Landlord of any defect in the Premises which might give rise to an obligation on the Landlord to do or refrain from doing any act or thing in order to comply with the provisions of this Lease or the duty of care imposed on the Landlord pursuant to the Defective Premises Act 1972 or otherwise and at all times to display and maintain all notices which the Landlord may from time to time[reasonably]require to be displayed at the Premises The difficulty here is that this covenant could impose an unfair obligation on the tenant and it should therefore be amended as follows: To give notice to the Landlord upon becoming aware of any defect…5.23 New guarantor Within [14]days of the death during the Term of any Guarantor or of such person becoming bankrupt or having a receiving order made against him or having a receiver appointed under the Mental Health Act 1983 or being a company passing a resolution to wind up or entering into liquidation or having a receiver appointed to give notice of this to the Landlord and if so required by the Landlord at the expense of the Tenant within [28]days to procure some other person acceptable to the Landlord [such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld]to execute a guarantee in respect of the Tenant's obligations contained  in this Lease in the form of the Guarantor's covenants contained in this Lease Although this may be perfectly fair and reasonable in that a guarantor's covenants are expected to last during the period for which they are given, many tenants try to resist this covenant on the basis that it may be extremely difficult for the tenant to produce an alternative guarantor.
If the provision is included in the lease and is exercised, the tenant should not forget to obtain a release of the original guarantor on the execution of the guarantee by the new guarantor.
There should also be a limitation on the time during which the landlord can require the tenant to procure a new guarantor and the following amendment is suggested:…and if so required by the Landlord by notice to the Tenant given within 28 days of receipt of the Tenant's notice at the expense of the Tenant within 56 days to procure some other person reasonably acceptable to the Landlord such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed…5.24 Landlord's rights To permit the Landlord at all times during the Term to exercise without interruption or interference any of the rights granted to [it]by virtue of the provisions of this Lease The point here is to ensure that the landlord's rights contained in the lease are not such as to cause unreasonable interference with the business being carried on at the premises.
The extended meaning given to the "landlord" by clause 3.10 should also be noted.
5.25 The shop covenants
5.25.1 To observe and perform the Shop Covenants
5.25.2 To observe and perform [its]obligations contained in the fifth Schedule See the fifth Schedule.
[5.26Landlord's costs on grant etc [To pay the fees and disbursements of the Landlord's  solicitors agents and surveyors and all other costs and expenses incurred by the Landlord in relation to the negotiation preparation execution and grant of this Lease and the stamp duty on the counterpart]Any proposal that the tenant should pay the landlord's costs incurred in connection with the grant of the lease should be vigorously rejected and the tenant's adviser should encourage the tenant to ensure that this aspect is dealt with during negotiations.
The Costs of Leases Act 1958 provides that in the absence of agreement in writing to the contrary, each party to a lease bears its own solicitor's costs, and this should be the position.
In Cairnplace Ltd v CBL (Property Investment) Co Ltd [1984]1 All ER 315, it was held that there should not be inserted in a renewal of a lease a provision that the tenant should pay the landlord's costs despite the fact that there was a similar provision contained in the previous lease.
The fact remains that the landlord litigated the point and perhaps this is the justification for trying to ensure that the tenant's interests are fully protected in leases wherever possible.
Landlord's Covenants
Introduction
Not surprisingly, the landlord's covenants are rather fewer than the tenant's and if one was of a mind, and really thought that it was worth the effort, it is possible to invent several pages of landlord's covenants which the tenant would dearly like to have included, but this would definitely not be worthwhile.
6 Landlord's Covenants
The Landlord covenants with the Tenant:
6.1 Quiet enjoyment To permit the Tenant peaceably and quietly to hold and enjoy the Premises without any interruption or disturbance from or by the Landlord or any person claiming under or in trust for the Landlord [or by title paramount]This covenant quite often contains a provision that it is dependent upon the tenant paying the rent reserved by the lease and performing and observing the covenants on its part and the conditions contained in the lease, but these words have no practical effect, and do not render payment of the rent and performance of the covenants conditions precedent to the operation of the covenant (Edge v Boileau (1885) 16 QB 117).
This covenant applies where the normal enjoyment of the premises is substantially interfered with either in respect of eviction, dispossession or the tenant's use of the premises.
However, the covenant will only protect the tenant from interruptions by the landlord and persons claiming under or in trust for it; therefore covering successors in title or persons having authority  from the landlord to do the acts complained of, but not covering the acts of a superior landlord or a predecessor in title of the landlord.
The tenant should accordingly extend the covenant to include a reference to title paramount.
6.2 Services To observe and perform [its]obligations contained in the sixth Schedule There should be a landlord's covenant to carry out the services and this covenant should not be qualified by a condition that the landlord's covenant is subject to the tenant having paid the service charge in respect thereof.
The service charge may be in dispute or there may be an inadvertent omission to pay on the part of the tenant.
These circumstances should not justify the landlord in withholding the services.
The following additional landlord's covenants should also be considered:
6.3 Superior lease Where the lease is an underlease, the tenant should consider inserting the following landlord's covenants: To pay the rents reserved by the [superior Lease]dated and made between and to observe and perform the covenants agreements and conditions on the part of the tenant contained therein and to enforce the covenants on the part of the Landlord in the said Lease Not to agree to the variation of any of the terms of the [superior Lease]without first obtaining the Tenant's written consent [such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed]
6.4 Non-competition It may not be in the best interests of the landlord or the tenant for there to be several units within a shopping centre being entitled to sell the same goods or services.
Good estate management should result in the landlord maintaining an even balance of trades but the following clause is nevertheless prudent: Not to permit or suffer any [adjoining or neighbouring premises in the ownership or control of the Landlord][other premises in the Centre]to be used for the business from time to time being carried on in the Premises
6.5 Similar leases The tenant, if taking premises in a shopping centre under a lease containing intricate service charge provisions, may wish to ensure that all leases of units in the centre mirror its own lease.
It may be that the tenant's lease contains covenants on its part that are for the benefit of other units within the centre and the tenant will expect similar reciprocal provisions to be contained in all other leases.
The following additional covenant is therefore suggested: To ensure that all other leases within the Centre contain similar covenants on the part of the Landlord and the Tenant and similar service charge provisions to those contained in this lease and to enforce the covenants on the part of the tenants contained in such other leases 
Insurance
Introduction
It is obviously essential that the premises and the building or complex (if applicable) are insured to their full reinstatement value from time to time during the lease.
The lease will indeed quite often contain extensive insurance provisions with this in mind and to ensure that all costs in respect of insurance are paid for by the tenant and not the landlord.
7.1 Warranty re-convictions The Tenant warrants that prior to the execution of this Lease [it]has disclosed to the Landlord in writing any conviction judgment or finding of any court or tribunal relating to the Tenant (or any director or other officer or major shareholder of the Tenant) of such a nature as to be likely to affect the decision of any insurer or underwriter to grant or to continue insurance of any of the Insured Risks The landlord may wish to include this in order to protect its position resulting from insurance contracts being uberrimae fidei, with the resultant obligation to disclose to the insurers material facts within its actual or presumed knowledge.
This clause could be used to rebut the suggestion by the landlord's insurers that the landlord had knowledge of such facts.
It would also give the landlord a right of action against the tenant for any breach.
Unfortunately, tenants (particularly directors of tenant companies) will wish to resist this provision on the basis that people are generally reluctant to reveal any such sensitive information about themselves.
7.2 Landlord to insure The Landlord covenants with the Tenant to insure the Premises and the Retained Parts [subject to the Tenant paying the Insurance Rent]unless such insurance shall be vitiated by any act of the Tenant or by anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority [and under the Tenant's control]While it would be preferable for the insurance to be in the joint names of the landlord and the tenant in order to give the tenant more control over the insurance and to avoid the problem of subrogation referred to below, landlords tend to resist this, presumably on the basis that they wish to retain absolute control and not rely on the tenant in any way as regards the insurance cover.
It is essential to ensure that where the premises form part of a larger building or a shopping centre the building (or the shopping centre) should also be insured as the tenant would wish the whole of the building to be reinstated in the event of damage or destruction and not just the premises.
The optional words referring to persons under the tenant's control should be included (see clause 5.4) unless of course the tenant is able to remove reference to such persons altogether.
Although possibly more relevant in connection with reinstatement the tenant should attempt to place some limitation on the persons who could void the policy.
If possible, any reference to subtenants, licensees and casual callers (eg customers) should be deleted and there should most certainly not be a reference to the avoidance of the policy by acts or omission of other tenants in a multi-occupied building or shopping centre.
There should also be deleted the reference to the landlord not being required to insure where the tenant has failed to pay the insurance rent, although any landlord in its right mind would do so in any event.
The clause could be amended to read as follows: The Landlord covenants with the Tenant to insure the Centre and all parts thereof except during such periods as the insurance shall be rendered ineffectual or avoided by any act of the Tenant
7.3 Details of the insurance Insurance shall be effected: 7.3.1 in such [substantial and reputable]insurance office or with  such underwriters and through such agency as the Landlord may from time to time decide
7.3.2 for the following sums:
7.3.2.1 such sum as the Landlord shall from time to time be advised [by the Surveyor]as being the full cost of rebuilding and reinstatement including architects' surveyors' and other professional fees payable upon any applications for planning permission or other permits or consents that may be required in relation to the rebuilding or reinstatement of the Centre the cost of debris removal demolition site clearance any works that may be required by statute and incidental expenses and
7.3.2.2 the loss of Rent and Service Charge payable under this Lease from time to time(having regard to any review of rent which may become due under this Lease) for [3]years or such longer period as the Landlord may from time to time [reasonably][consider to be sufficient or deem to be necessary]for the purposes of the planning and carrying out the rebuilding or reinstatement
7.3.3 against damage or destruction by the Insured Risks to the extent that such insurance may ordinarily be arranged for properties such as the Centre with an insurer of repute and subject to such excesses exclusions or limitations as the insurer may require It may be advisable to provide that the insurer should have principal offices in the United Kingdom, but this is no guarantee that the insurer will not succumb to liquidation or contest claims, and one wonders whether this would find favour with our European partners.
In addition it is worth noting that "insurance office" would probably not include insurance effected through Lloyd's underwriters.
This is relevant when considering the provisions of s 83) of the Fire Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774, by which either party has the right to require insurance monies to be laid out in reinstatement (if a request is made to the insurance company before the monies are paid to the insured) as it seems that the Act does not apply to insurance through Lloyds.
The insurance should cover the full cost of rebuilding and reinstatement from time to time, although it is accepted that a covenant to insure for the "full cost of reinstatement" will be construed as meaning the cost of reinstatement at the time when reinstatement actually takes place, as opposed to the date when the  premium is paid, or any other date.
Expressions such as "to insure adequately" and "to insure to the full value of the property" should be amended as the former covenant could be complied with if the cover equates to that recommended by the insurance company, and the latter could be interpreted as meaning the full market value of the property and, as such, could be less than the cost of reinstatement.
It is important to ensure that supplemental fees are included as well as the cost of debris removal, demolition etc.
Loss of rent should be insured but there should be some upper limitation on the number of years' cover.
It is generally thought that if premises cannot be reinstated within three years then something is grossly wrong.
The tenant should endeavour to ensure that all reasonable and normal risks are covered by the landlord's insurance.
Sometimes the insured risks are stated to be: fire and such other risks as the Landlord may from time to time deem it desirable to insure against This is clearly inadequate as there is an interrelationship between the insurance clause, the tenant's repairing covenant and the proviso for suspension of rent.
Rent is usually only suspended where the premises are unfit for occupation and use as a result of damage or destruction by an insured risk.
Similarly, the exception to the tenant's repairing liability relates principally to damage or destruction by an insured risk.
The only alternative is for the tenant to insure the missing risks itself, but this may not be cost effective, particularly if the landlord is a large property company and therefore more able to obtain cheaper cover.
Therefore the landlord should be encouraged to insure against all normal risks.
The risks detailed are not all-encompassing and could vary depending upon various aspects, including the locality of the premises, eg subsidence or heave may be advisable in an area of clay subsoil.
The tenant's surveyor should be consulted to advise on the risks to be covered should any doubt exist.
Clause 7.3 could be amended to read as follows:
7.3 Details of the insurance Insurance shall be effected:
7.3.1 in such substantial and reputable insurance office or with such underwriters and through such agency as the Landlord  may from time to time reasonably decide in each case with principal offices in the United Kingdom
7.3.2 For the following sums:
7.3.2.1 such sum as the Landlord shall from time to time be advised [by the Surveyor]as being the full cost of building and reinstatement including architects' surveyors' and other professional fees payable upon any applications for planning permission or other permits or consents that may be required in relation to the rebuilding or reinstatement of the Centre the cost of debris removal demolition site clearance any works that may be required by statute and proper and reasonable incidental expenses and
7.3.2.2 the loss of Rent and Service Charge payable under this Lease from time to time(having reasonable regard to any review of rent which may become due under this Lease) for 3 years
7.3.3 against damage or destruction by the Insured Risks to the extent that such insurance may ordinarily be arranged for properties such as the Centre with an insurer of repute and subject to such excesses exclusions or limitations as the insurer may reasonably require
7.4 Payment of insurance rent The Tenant shall pay the Insurance Rent on the date of this Lease for the period from and including the Rent Commencement Date to the day before the next policy renewal date and subsequently the Tenant shall pay the Insurance Rent on demand (if so demanded) in advance [but not more than [months]in advance of the policy renewal date It is obviously advisable that the tenant should not pay the insurance rent too far in advance of the policy renewal date.
7.5 Suspension of rent
7.5.1 If and whenever during the Term:
7.5.1.1 the Premises or the Retained Parts or any part of either of them are damaged or any part of them are damaged or destroyed by any of the [Insured Risks or Insured Risks except one against which insurance may not ordinarily be arranged with an insurer of repute for properties such as the Premises unless the Landlord has in fact insured against that risk]so that the Premises or any part of them are unfit for occupation or use and
7.5.1.2 payment of the insurance money is not refused in whole or in part by reason of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority [and under the Tenant's control]the provisions of clause 7.5.2 shall have effect
7.5.2 When the circumstances contemplated in clause 7.5.1 arise the Rent [and Service Charge]or a fair proportion of the Rent [and Service Charge]according to the nature and the extent of the damage sustained shall cease to be payable until the Premises or the Retained Parts or the damaged parts of either of them shall have been rebuilt or reinstated so that the Premises or the affected part are made fit for occupation or use [or until the expiration of [3]years from the destruction or damage whichever period is the shorter][(the amount of such proportion and the period during which the Rent [and Service Charge]shall cease to be payable to be determined by the Surveyor acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) or (any dispute as to such proportion or the period during which the Rent [and Service Charge]shall cease to be payable to be determined in accordance with the Arbitration Acts 1950 to 1979 by an arbitrator to be appointed by agreement between the parties or in default by the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors upon the application of either party)]This provision should always be amended to include reference not only to the premises but also to the building of which the premises form part in the event that the premises do not stand alone.
In the case of premises forming part of a shopping centre a similar expansion is recommended.
The fact is that damage or destruction of other parts of the building or of the shopping centre (if applicable) may render the premises unusable despite the fact that the premises have not been damaged or destroyed.
A reference, as in the precedent, to the retained parts goes some way towards covering the point, but the damage or destruction of neighbouring units in a shopping centre could also render the premises unusable.
The tenant should also consider deleting reference to the insured risks completely, as the damage or destruction rendering the premises unusable may not in fact stem from an insured risk.
Unfortunately, this would be certain to meet with opposition from the landlord.
There is a very good argument that not only the rent should be suspended but also the service charge and the insurance rent, particularly where the premises form part of a shopping centre.
In such a case, it seems unfair that the tenant should continue to pay these ancillary sums when the premises are unusable.
Any limitation on the suspension of rent should be resisted unless there is included in the lease a clause allowing surrender where the premises are not reinstated within a given period of time.
The tenant should also consider amending 7.5.2 to extend the suspension by an additional three months to enable the tenant to fit out the premises and there is no harm in including a provision that a due proportion of rents paid in advance should be refunded to the tenant.
Clause 7.5 could be amended to read as follows:
7.5.1 If and whenever during the Term:
7.5.1.1 the Centre or any part of the Centre or its essential accesses or services are damaged or destroyed [by any of the Insured Risks][or otherwise]so as to render the Premises or any part of them unfit for occupation or use and
7.5.1.2 payment of the insurance money is not refused in whole or in part by reason of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority while under the Tenant's control and in the employment of the Tenant the provisions of clause 7.5.2 shall have effect
7.5.2 When the circumstances contemplated in clause 7.5.1 arise the rents or a fair proportion of the rents according to the nature and the extent of the damage sustained shall cease to be payable until the date which falls 3 months after the date when the Premises with essential accesses and services are again rendered fit for occupation and use and a due proportion of the rents paid in advance shall be refunded to the Tenant any dispute as to such proportion or the period during which the rents shall cease to be payable to be determined in accordance with the Arbitration Acts 1950 to 1979 by an arbitrator to be appointed by agreement between the parties or in default by the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors upon the application of either party 
7.6 Reinstatement and termination if prevented
7.6.1 If and whenever during the Term:
7.6.1.1 the Premises the Retained Parts or any part of either of them are damaged or destroyed by any of the [Insured Risks or Insured Risks except one against which insurance may not ordinarily be arranged with an insurer of repute for properties such as the Premises unless the Landlord has in fact insured against that risk]and
7.6.1.2 the payment of the insurance money is not refused in whole or in part by reason of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority [and under the Tenant's control]the Landlord shall use [its]best endeavours to obtain all planning permissions or other permits and consents that may be required under the Planning Acts or other statutes (if any) to enable the Landlord to rebuild and reinstate ( "Permissions" ) The insured risks referred to in 7.6.1.1 will hopefully have been specified in clause 2.8 or in the policy details supplied to the tenant from time to time pursuant to clause 7.9.1
Wherever possible, an obligation should be obtained from the landlord to use its best endeavours to obtain all necessary permissions.
The clause could be amended as follows:
7.6.1 If and whenever during the Term:
7.6.1.1 the Centre or any part thereof or its essential accesses or services are damaged or destroyed by any of the Insured Risks and
7.6.1.2 the payment of the insurance money is not refused in whole or in part by reason of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority while under the Tenant's control and in the employment of the Tenant the Landlord shall use its best endeavours to obtain all planning permissions or other permits and consents that may be required under the Planning Acts or other statutes (if any) to enable the Landlord to rebuild and reinstate ( "Permissions" )
7.6.2 Subject to the provisions of clauses 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 the  Landlord shall as soon as the Permissions have been obtained or immediately where no Permissions are required apply all money received in respect of such insurance (except sums in respect of loss of Rent) in rebuilding or reinstating the Premises or the Retained Parts so destroyed or damaged [making up any difference between the cost of rebuilding and reinstating and the money received out of the Landlord's own money]It is important to include the words in square brackets in order to ensure that the damaged or destroyed premises are reinstated.
This may be particularly important where there is a limitation on the suspension of rent provision, ie rent resumes after three years, and the landlord claims to have performed its covenants by using the insurance money received.
If the landlord has covenanted "to reinstate" the problem would probably be avoided, similarly where the covenant is to insure "for the full cost of reinstatement" (without any qualification as included in clause 7.3.2.1), in which case any resultant shortfall would presumably result in a breach of the covenant.
The latter part of the clause should be amended as follows:…
In rebuilding or reinstating those parts of the Centre including essential accesses and services so destroyed or damaged making up any difference between the cost of rebuilding and reinstating and the insurance money received out of the Landlord's own money
7.6.3 For the purposes of this clause the expression "supervening Events" means:
7.6.3.1 the Landlord has failed despite using [its]best endeavours to obtain the Permissions
7.6.3.2 any of the Permissions have been granted subject to a lawful condition with which [it would be impossible for or in all the circumstances it would be unreasonable to expect]the Landlord to comply
7.6.3.3 some defect or deficiency in the site upon which the rebuilding or reinstatement is to take place [would render the same impossible or would mean that the same could only be undertaken at a cost that would be unreasonable in all the circumstances]
7.6.3.4 the Landlord is unable to obtain access to the site for the purposes of rebuilding or reinstating 
7.6.3.5 the rebuilding or reinstating is prevented by war act of God, government action [strike lock-out]or
7.6.3.6 any other circumstances beyond the control of the Landlord
7.6.4 The Landlord shall not be liable to rebuild or reinstate the Premises or the Retained Parts if and for so long as such rebuilding or reinstating is prevented by Supervening Events
7.6.5 If upon the expiry of a period of [3]years commencing on the date of the damage or destruction the Premises and the Retained Parts have not been rebuilt or reinstated so that the Premises are fit for the Tenant's occupation and use either party may by notice served at any time within [6]months of the expiry of such period invoke the provisions of clause 7.6.6
7.6.6 Upon service of a notice in accordance with clause 7.6.5:
7.6.6.1 the Term will absolutely cease but without prejudice to any rights or remedies that may have accrued to either party against the other including (without prejudice to the generality of the above) any right that the Tenant might have against the Landlord for a breach of the Landlord's covenants set out in clauses 7.6.1 and 7.6.2
7.6.6.2 all money received in respect of the insurance effected by the Landlord pursuant to this clause shall belong to the Landlord The problem is that all of the events set out in 7.6.3 seem reasonable, but the fact is that any suspension of the landlord's obligation to reinstate could lead to uncertainty, which is not in the best interests of either party.
It is accordingly advisable for the lease to contain a right to terminate the lease if reinstatement has not taken place within a reasonable period.
The tenant may wish to dispense with 7.6.3, 7.6.4, 7.6.5 and 7.6.6 and add the following proviso to 7.6.2: If for any reason the premises and all other relevant parts of the centre sufficient for the Tenant [or any undertenant]to carry on its [or their]normal trade and business including the means of access to the Premises and all essential services therein and thereto shall not be reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this clause as they were at the date of the relevant destruction or damage by the second anniversary of the date of the  destruction or damage the Tenant may thereafter determine the Term by giving not less than one month's notice to the Landlord and upon expiry of such notice the Term shall cease but without prejudice to the claim of either party for any earlier breach of covenant by the other This will doubtless be resisted by the landlord who will wish to have the unilateral right to terminate.
The tenant may be wary of this in case it is used by the landlord to remove the tenant (in a buoyant market) but any dilatoriness on the part of the landlord in reinstating where none of the supervening events applies could be seized upon by the tenant.
If a formula similar to the above is chosen, the tenant must ensure that the rent (or rents) does not resume, pursuant to any limitation on the suspension of rent provision, before the tenant has the right to terminate.
It may be considered that a three year period in 7.6.5 is too long and that two years is an adequate period for reinstatement to take place, but the landlord will probably hold out for the longer period.
As regards the period of notice to be given in 7.6.5, the tenant's notice need be only a few days, but the landlord will remain subject to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 and will have to serve a notice of at least six months.
If the Act does apply, the landlord must establish one of the grounds permitted by the Act if the tenant opposes the notice on the basis that it fully intends to resume occupation of the premises when they are reinstated.
The division of the insurance money in the event of termination can give rise to uncertainty if not provided for in the lease.
Authorities seem confused on this topic.
In Beacon Carpets Ltd v Kirby [1985]QB 755 the court decided that the proceeds of insurance should be divided between the landlord and tenant in accordance with their respective interests in the property.
This would seem to accord with the dissenting judgment of Lord Denning MR in Re King, Robinson v Gray [1963]Ch 459 where the majority of the Court of Appeal decided that a tenant who had insured in the joint names of the landlord and tenant should be entitled to the whole of the proceeds.
This cannot be logical, and there is some support for landlords who feel justified in requiring the proceeds to be paid to them on the basis that a lease is for a limited duration but the freehold (where applicable) is for life.
Nevertheless, there is no harm in a tenant trying for a compromise and the following provision (adapted for adding to the above amendment to clause 7.6.2) could be considered: AND upon cesser of the Term by notice hereunder the insurance money shall in respect of the destruction or damage of the Premises under the policy maintained under this clause [7]be divided between the Landlord and the Tenant according to the value at the date of the destruction or damage of their respective interests in the Premises (to be determined in default of agreement by a single arbitrator to be appointed by the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on the application of either party)
7.7 Tenant's insurance covenants It is important that the lease contains general covenants on the part of the tenant relating to insurance sufficient to ensure that the insurance is not vitiated because of foolish acts on the part of the tenant.
The Tenant covenants with the Landlord:
7.7.1 to comply with all the requirements and recommendations of the insurers The problem with the requirements and recommendations of insurers is that some insurers can impose quite unreasonable requirements and recommendations.
It is important to try to give the tenant the opportunity of objecting to unreasonable requirements and recommendations, hence the suggested amendment, although it may be that the landlord will make the reasonably valid statement that the actual requirements of the insurers must be complied with as otherwise the landlord will be forever switching insurance companies.
It is fair to say, however, that this argument could be countered by the statement that the landlord should not expect the tenant to comply with unreasonable requirements and recommendations, even if it means the landlord changing insurers.
7.7.1 to comply with the [reasonable]requirements and [reasonable]recommendations of the insurers
7.7.2 not to do or omit anything that could cause any policy of insurance on or in relation to the Premises to become void or voidable wholly or in part nor (unless the Tenant shall have previously notified the Landlord and have agreed to pay the increased premium) anything by which additional insurance premiums may become payable This does not seem unreasonable.
7.7.3 to keep the Premises supplied with such fire fighting equipment as the insurers and the fire authority may require [or as the Landlord may reasonably require]and to maintain such equipment to their satisfaction and in efficient working order and at least once in every [6]months to cause any sprinkler system and other fire fighting equipment to be inspected by a competent person The same argument as above applies with regard to fire fighting equipment.
It is clearly essential that the fire authority's requirements are complied with in this regard, be they reasonable or not, but there is no harm in insisting upon any insurers' requirements being reasonable and, in any event, the reference to the landlord's requirements, reasonable or otherwise, should be deleted.
7.7.4 not to store or bring onto the Premises any article substance or liquid of a specifically combustible inflammable or explosive nature and to comply with the requirements and recommendations of the fire authority [and the [reasonable]requirements of the Landlord]as to fire precautions relating to the Premises Some tenants sell inflammable or what may be considered to be otherwise dangerous substances in the normal course of their business.
A specific exclusion should be made in respect of such items which may require the insurer's consent.
The other amendments to this covenant are self-explanatory.
7.7.4 not to store or bring onto the Premises any article substance or liquid of a specially combustible inflammable or explosive nature other than such articles as are offered for sale by the Tenant or any undertenant in its or their normal trade and business and to comply with the requirements and recommendations of the fire authority as to fire precautions relating to the Premises
7.7.5 not to obstruct the access to any fire equipment or the means of escape from the Premises nor to lock any fire door while the Premises are occupied This is reasonable and advisable.
7.7.6 to give notice to the Landlord immediately upon the happening of any event which might affect any insurance policy on or relating to the Premises or upon the happening of any event against which the Landlord may have insured under this Lease  The following amendment should be considered:…immediately upon becoming aware of the happening of any event…7.7.7 immediately to inform the Landlord in writing of any conviction judgment or finding of any court or tribunal relating to the Tenant (or any director other officer or major shareholder of the Tenant) of such a nature as to be likely to affect the decision of any insurer or underwriter to grant or to continue any such insurance The requirement to notify the landlord in respect of convictions should be deleted for the reason stated above.
7.7.8 If at any time the Tenant shall be entitled to the benefit of any insurance on the Premises (which is not effected or maintained in pursuance of any obligation contained in this Lease) to apply all money received by virtue of such insurance in making good the loss or damage in respect of which such money shall have been received The landlord's concern is to avoid the situation by which its insurers may refuse to pay the whole of the proceeds of insurance where the tenant has also taken out insurance cover for the premises, pursuant to a common provision found in insurance policies.
If the following clause is included (which is stated in the precedent possibly to be inappropriate where the premises form part of a larger building or centre), the following comments will apply:[7.7.9 if and whenever during the Term the Premises or any part of them are damaged or destroyed by an Insured Risk and the insurance money under the policy of insurance effected by the Landlord pursuant to[its]obligations contained in this Lease is by reason of any act or default of the Tenant or anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority [and under the Tenant's control]wholly or partially irrecoverable immediately in every such case (at the option of the Landlord) either:
7.7.9.1 to rebuild and reinstate at its own expense the Premises or the part destroyed or damaged to the reasonable satisfaction and under the supervision of the Surveyor the  Tenant being allowed towards the expenses of so doing upon such rebuilding and reinstatement being completed the amount (if any) actually received in respect of such destruction or damage under any such insurance policy or
7.7.9.2 to pay to the Landlord on demand with Interest the amount of such insurance money so irrecoverable in which event the provisions of clauses 7.5 and 7.6 shall apply]It is not unreasonable for a lease to contain a provision that the tenant will pay for the reinstatement of premises where insurance has been vitiated subject to a limitation being placed on the persons who can trigger this provision and possibly subject to the tenant being allowed to receive the payable insurance money as the reinstatement progresses.
The following amendment to 7.7.9.2 should however be considered:
7.7.9.2 To pay to the Landlord on demand with Interest (where the Landlord has rebuilt and reinstated the Premises out of its own money) the amount of such insurance money so irrecoverable in which event the provisions of clauses 7.5 and 7.6 shall apply and clause 7.7.9 should contain the following amendment:…anyone at the Premises expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority while under the Tenant's control and in the employment of the Tenant wholly or partially irrecoverable…7.8 Increase or decrease of the Centre If at any time during the Term the Centre shall be increased or decreased on a permanent basis the Insurance Rent Percentage shall be varied with effect from the first premium or additional premium payable in respect of a period after such a change by agreement between the parties or in default of agreement within [3]months of the first proposal for variation made by the Landlord in such a manner as shall be determined to be fair and reasonable in the light of the event in question by the Surveyor acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator This requires no comment.
[7.9 Landlord's insurance covenants The Landlord covenants with the Tenant in relation to the  policy of insurance effected by the Landlord pursuant to[its]obligations contained in this Lease:
7.9.1 to produce to the Tenant on demand [a copy of the policy and the last premium renewal receipt or reasonable evidence of the terms of the policy and the fact that the last premium has been paid]
7.9.2 to procure that the interest of the Tenant is noted or indorsed on the policy
7.9.3 to notify the Tenant of any [material]change in the risks covered by the policy from time to time[and
7.9.4 to produce to the Tenant on demand written confirmation from the insurers that they have agreed to waive all rights of subrogation against the Tenant]]It is essential that covenants of this nature should be included except where insurance is to be in the joint names of the landlord and tenant.
There should be produced to the tenant not only a copy of the policy and/or a summary of the insured risks but also evidence of the payment of the last premium.
It is suggested that where the premises form part of a number of properties insured by the landlord under a block policy, it would be unreasonable to expect the landlord to produce the policy and this is accepted.
The landlord should either obtain from the insurers a waiver of subrogation rights as regards the tenant, any undertenant and their mortgagees, or if that is not possible or practicable then the landlord should endeavour to note their interests on the policy.
This is in order to try to avoid the effects of subrogation, viz where the insurer pays out money to the landlord under an insurance policy he will be subrogated to any rights the landlord may have against the tenant for breaches of covenant which may have given rise to the damage or destruction.
The position is now somewhat alleviated by the case of Rowlands (Mark) Ltd v Berni Inns Ltd [1985]QB 211 where it was held that the intention of the parties to the lease was that the landlord's claim would be against the insurers under the insurance policy and that the landlord would not have a claim against the tenant for breach of covenant, to the effect that there was no claim to which the insurers could be subrogated.
Nevertheless, this case turned on a question of construction without any general statement of principle being expounded, and it would therefore seem sensible that a tenant should try to ensure that subrogation rights are avoided wherever possible.
A clear waiver of subrogation rights issued by the insurers is obviously  preferred, but it is generally accepted that the noting of interests will have the same effect, although there is no guarantee of this.
Clause 7.9.3 is not to be spurned by the tenant, but if the tenant calls for details of the insurance on a regular basis, as it should do, it is perhaps not vital but nevertheless worth including.
The following amendments should be considered:
7.9 Landlord's insurance covenants The Landlord covenants with the Tenant in relation to the policy of insurance effected by the Landlord pursuant to its obligations contained in this Lease:
7.9.1 to produce to the Tenant on demand a copy of the policy and of the last premium renewal receipt or reasonable evidence of the terms of the policy and the fact that the last premium has been paid
7.9.2 to procure either that the interest of the Tenant and any undertenant and its or their mortgagees are noted or indorsed on the policy or that the insurers issue a waiver of subrogation rights as regards the Tenant any undertenant and its or their mortgagees
7.9.3 to notify the Tenant of any change in the risks covered by the policy from time to time and
7.9.4 to produce to the Tenant on demand written confirmation from the insurers that they have agreed to waive all rights of subrogation against the Tenant any undertenant and its or their mortgagees 
Provisos
Introduction
The provisos set out in a lease cover a range of miscellaneous matters which can have an important bearing on the lease.
9 Provisos
9.1 Re-entry If and whenever during the Term:
9.1.1 The rents (or any of them or any part of them) under this Lease are outstanding for [14 days]after becoming due whether formally demanded or not
9.1.2 there is a breach by the Tenant [or the Guarantor]of any covenant or other term of this Lease or any document [expressed to be]supplemental to this Lease or
9.1.3 an individual Tenant becomes bankrupt or
9.1.4 a company Tenant [or the Guarantor]:
9.1.4.1 enters into liquidation whether compulsory or voluntary (but not if the liquidation is for amalgamation or reconstruction of a solvent company) or
9.1.4.2 has a receiver appointed or
9.1.5 the Tenant enters into an arrangement for the benefit of [its]creditors or
9.1.6 the Tenant has any distress or execution levied on [its]goods the Landlord may re-enter the Premises (or any part of them in the name of the whole) at any time (and even if any previous right of re-entry has been waived) and then the Term will absolutely cease but without prejudice to any rights or remedies which may  have accrued to the Landlord against the Tenant or the Guarantor [or to the Tenant against the Landlord]in respect of any breach of covenant or other term of this Lease (including the breach in respect of which the re-entry is made) All leases will, or should, contain a forfeiture provision which is usually in the form of a proviso reserving to the landlord a right of re-entry in the event of non-payment of rent, breach of covenant or circumstances resulting in, or likely to give rise to, the probability of the tenant being unable to perform its obligations under the lease, eg bankruptcy or liquidation.
Given the generous relief against forfeiture provisions contained in s 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 a tenant should have little to fear from a forfeiture clause unless it is seriously in financial difficulties or has committed a serious breach of covenant which cannot be rectified.
Some amendments to the standard provision are advisable, however, and may be summarised as follows:(1) The period of grace before the forfeiture provision bites in respect of outstanding rents should be no less than 14 days and ideally 28, though the usual compromise is 21 days.
(2) Frequently reference is made (as in the precedent) to forfeiture being available on the breach of a covenant by the guarantor or on the bankruptcy of the guarantor.
This should be resisted.
In the latter case, if there is a provision for the tenant to provide a substitute guarantor on the bankruptcy or liquidation of the original guarantor the landlord should not be too disadvantaged and it would seem reasonable to resist the stringent forfeiture provision.
(3) The tenant should try to insert reference to the tenant being construed to be: the tenant for the time being or better still: while this Lease shall be vested in the Tenant This is to obviate the remote possibility of an argument as to whether the bankruptcy or liquidation of the original tenant (after an assignment) who will presumably still be within the definition of "the Tenant" could affect the re-entry provisions contained in the lease.
This is quite academic and, in any event, relief against forfeiture would almost definitely be  granted, but many old tried and tested precedents provided for this eventuality and there is no harm in a belt and braces approach.
(4) Many tenants object to forfeiture provisions applying where distress or execution has been levied on its goods at the premises, as even in the best run organisations this sometimes occurs and it is not always an indication that the tenant is in financial difficulty.
It is therefore advisable to delete clause 9.1.6, or if that fails, at least ensure that it is amended to refer to the distress or execution being levied at the premises (5) Consider adding the following two provisos: PROVIDED HOWEVER that in the event that this Lease is mortgaged at the time of the proposed re-entry and the Landlord has been given notice of the existence of the mortgage then prior to such re-entry or proceedings therefor the Landlord will serve a notice of such proceedings and proposed re-entry on the mortgagee at the mortgagee's last known address AND PROVIDED FURTHER that if the Tenant (being an individual) becomes bankrupt or (being a company) enters into liquidation (whether compulsory or voluntary save for the purposes of amalgamation or reconstruction of a solvent company) or has a receiver appointed the Landlord shall not exercise the right of re-entry by virtue of such bankruptcy liquidation or receivership unless neither the Tenant nor its mortgagee shall pay the rent hereinbefore reserved on the days and in the manner provided or there shall be any breach or non-performance or non-observance of any of the other covenants or agreements on the part of the Tenant herein contained
9.2 Party walls The internal non-load bearing walls that divide the Premises from the adjoining units in the Centre and from the Retained Parts shall be deemed to be party walls within the meaning of the Law of Property Act 1925 section 38 and shall be maintained at the equally shared expense of the Tenant and the other respective estate owners  As the footnote to the precedent states, the object of this provision is that the tenant and the adjoining estate owner (who could be either another tenant or even the landlord) will share the responsibility for the internal divisional walls.
If the landlord prefers to covenant to maintain the outer half of all internal non load-bearing walls dividing the premises from other parts of the building and recovering the cost via the service charge, the tenant should ensure that any sums collected by the landlord from other tenants under the terms of their leases to maintain their half of the divisional wall should be deducted from the service charge.
9.3 Covenants relating to adjoining Premises Nothing contained in or implied by this Lease shall give the Tenant the benefit of or the right to enforce or to prevent the release or modification of any covenant agreement or condition entered into by any tenant of the Landlord in respect of any property not comprised in this Lease Tenants have very limited rights to enforce covenants against each other.
The general rule is that one tenant cannot enforce covenants contained in another tenant's lease, but there are a number of exceptions being mainly as follows:(1) Where a tenant has taken an assignment from the landlord of the benefit of a covenant entered into by a tenant of other premises;(2) Where various tenants or their predecessors in title have entered into a mutual deed of covenant (in which case each can enforce the covenants against the others);(3) Where the estate has been laid out under a common scheme for building (known as a building scheme) and the leases have been taken pursuant to that scheme;(4) Where there is a letting scheme, which is similar to a building scheme, but there need be no physical laying out of the estate.
Most leases of commercial centres do not fall within the above categories but if the lease in question does, then it may be advisable to delete the words "to enforce or" from line two of the proviso.
In fact, it may be as well to include the following proviso: provided the Premises are not adversely affected thereby 
9.4 Disputes with adjoining occupiers If any dispute arises between the Tenant and the tenants or occupiers of other parts of the Centre or the Adjoining Property as to any easement right or privilege in connection with the use of the Premises and any other part of the Centre or the Adjoining Property or as to the boundary structures separating the Premises from any other property it shall be decided [by the Landlord or in such manner as the Landlord shall direct or by the Surveyor acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator]The problem with this provision is that it restricts the tenant in any action it may wish to take against other tenants, and could result in a dispute being settled against its best interests.
Also, it will only bind the other party to the dispute if a similar provision is contained in that tenant's lease.
It may therefore be advisable to delete this proviso, but it is not disastrous if it remains.
9.5 Effect of waiver Each of the Tenant's covenants shall remain in full force both at law and in equity notwithstanding that the Landlord shall have waived or released temporarily any such covenant or waived or released temporarily or permanently revocably or irrevocably a similar covenant or similar covenants affecting any other part of the Centre or the Adjoining Property This provision is an attempt to circumvent the rather harsh law of waiver, by which a landlord will lose its right to forfeit the lease where a non-continuing breach has occurred if the landlord does some act to suggest that the landlord is nevertheless satisfied to continue the tenancy, eg by accepting rent from the tenant.
Some leases contain rather more elaborate provisos such as: "no demand for or acceptance of rent by the landlord or its agents with knowledge of a breach of any of the covenants on the part of the tenant contained in these presents shall be or be deemed to be a waiver wholly or partially of any such breach but such breach shall be deemed to be a continuing breach of covenant" .
It has been suggested that such provisos are not effective in protecting a landlord from the severity of the law and cannot be set up as a defence to the claim that by accepting rent the breach of covenant has been waived.
The first part of the provision may not therefore be wholly  effective in any event and the question is whether the tenant is prepared to accept it in return for a concession from the landlord elsewhere in the lease.
The second part of the provision is not unreasonable.
9.6 Rights easements etc The [operation of the Law of Property Act 1925 Section 62 shall be excluded from this Lease and the only rights granted to the Tenant are those expressly set out in this Lease [and such further ancillary rights that arise under the general law or by necessary implication]and the Tenant shall not by virtue of this Lease be deemed to have acquired or be entitled to and the]Tenant shall not during the Term acquire or become entitled by any means whatever to any easement from or over or affecting any other land or Premises now or at any time after the date of this Lease belonging to the Landlord and not comprised in this Lease Section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925 provides that a lease is deemed to include, in the absence of any contrary intention, all easements, rights and advantages appertaining or reputed to appertain to the premises at the time of the lease.
This could have severe repercussions for the landlord in that it could include easements over the adjoining retained land of the landlord adversely affecting the landlord's ability to use or develop that land.
It is also dangerous for a tenant to rely on the provisions of s 62 as the section does not, for example, apply to services and, additionally, as the section takes effect from the date of the demise, it may not be easy to adduce evidence 15 years after the grant that the right complained of was used by the occupants when the lease was granted.
It is therefore sensible to set out fully in the lease, for the purpose of clarification, the rights to be granted in order to try to avoid subsequent disputes.
The words and such further ancillary rights that arise under the general law or by necessary implication should be included and could be expanded to include ancillary rights that arise by necessity 
9.7 Accidents The Landlord shall not be responsible to the Tenant or to anyone at the Premises or the Centre expressly or by implication with the Tenant's authority for any accident happening or injury suffered or for any damage or to or loss of any chattel sustained in the Premises or the Centre There is a question mark attached to the effectiveness of this provision on the basis that a party cannot exclude its liability for death or personal injuries caused by its negligence.
It may be extremely difficult for the landlord to resist a claim by a person at the premises who suffers injury as a result of the landlord's default and who was not a party to the lease.
Nevertheless, if the provision is to remain, the following proviso should be added: except where such injury damage or loss is caused as a result of a breach of any of the Landlord's covenants herein contained
9.8 Perpetuity period The perpetuity period applicable to this Lease shall be [80]years from the commencement of the Contractual Term and whenever in this Lease either party is granted a future interest in property there shall be deemed to be included in respect of every such grant a provision requiring that future interest to vest within the stated period and for it to be void for remoteness if it shall not have so vested Despite the importance of the rule against perpetuities, it is surprising that most leases granted today make no mention of it.
Without becoming too detailed, the rule can result in the grant of future interests being void where they do not vest within 21 years from the date of the grant of the lease.
For instance, the right reserved under paragraph 1 of the third schedule to this lease refers to "Pipes which may during the term be…under…the Premises" .
Without a specific perpetuity period of at least the length of the term (if the term exceeds 21 years) plus a few additional years to cover holding over under the 1954 Act, there would be no right to use pipes placed under the premises during the 23rd year of the term.
The same point applies, of course to rights granted to the tenant.
The specified period of 80 years is the period referred to in the  Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964, but there is no reason why the period cannot be less, eg 30 years for a 25 year term.
9.9 Exclusion of use warranty Nothing in this Lease or in any consent granted by the Landlord under this Lease shall imply or warrant that the Premises may lawfully be used under the Planning Acts for the purpose authorised in this Lease (or any purpose subsequently authorised) It is for the tenant to ensure that there is a lawful planning permission in existence consenting to the use for which the tenant proposes to put the premises.
There is in fact no implied covenant or warranty on the part of the landlord in this regard.
It should also be noted that there is no covenant or warranty implied that the premises are legally fit for the use for which the tenant intends using them and it is for the tenant to satisfy itself in this regard.
In the case of an underlease the subtenant should always require right of the superior lease or leases to satisfy itself that there are no restrictions likely to affect the subtenant's proposed use of the premises.
9.10 Entire understanding This Lease embodies the entire understanding of the parties relating to the Premises and to all the matters dealt with by any of the provisions of this Lease The provision has merit from both parties' points of view.
It is perhaps a reminder to the parties' advisers to encourage the parties to have one final read through the engrossments before execution.
9.11 Representations The Tenant acknowledges that this Lease has not been entered into in reliance wholly or partly on any statement or representation made by or on behalf of the Landlord except any such statement or representation that is expressly set out in this Lease This is self-explanatory but see the comments on misrepresentation under clause 11 of the agreement for lease.
9.12 Licences etc under hand Whilst the Landlord is a limited company or other corporation all licences consents approvals and notices required to be given by the Landlord shall be sufficiently given if given under the hand of a director the secretary or other duly authorised officer of the Landlord [or the Surveyor on behalf of the Landlord]Without this provision, the effectiveness of licences and consents granted by the landlord during the term and not under seal could be in doubt.
It may, however, be that even without this provision, a landlord who had granted a licence to a tenant signed by an authorised director could expect to be estopped from denying its effectiveness.
9.13 Tenant's property If after the Tenant has vacated the Premises on the expiry of the Term any property of the Tenant remains in or on the Premises and the Tenant fails to remove it within [7]days after being requested in writing by the Landlord to do so or if after using [its]best endeavours the Landlord is unable to make such a request to the Tenant within [14]days from the first attempt so made by the Landlord:
9.13.1 the Landlord may as the agent of the Tenant sell such property and the Tenant will indemnify the Landlord against any liability incurred by [it]to any third party whose property shall have been sold by the Landlord in the mistaken belief held in good faith (which shall be presumed unless the contrary be proved) that such property belonged to the Tenant
9.13.2 if the Landlord having made reasonable efforts is unable to locate the Tenant the Landlord shall be entitled to retain such proceeds of sale absolutely unless the Tenant shall claim them within [6]months of the date upon which the Tenant vacated the Premises and
9.13.3 the Tenant shall indemnify the Landlord against any damage occasioned to the Premises and any actions claims proceedings cost expenses and demands made against the Landlord caused by or related to the presence of the property in or on the Premises This provision has become rather popular of late and it is difficult  to argue against its inclusion.
Quite clearly, if a tenant vacates premises and decides to leave all manner of items behind, thereby inhibiting the landlord from reletting the premises, the tenant can hardly complain if the landlord sells the discarded property.
Furthermore, a landlord cannot be expected to spend years chasing after a tenant in order to avail the tenant of the proceeds of sale.
The retention of such money by the landlord after a reasonable period of time is not unfair.
It is more a case of striking a fair balance between the landlord and the tenant.
The periods of 7 and 14 days should certainly be amended to 14 and 28 days.
9.14 Compensation on vacating Any statutory right of the Tenant to claim compensation from the Landlord on vacating the Premises shall be excluded to the extent that the law allows Basically, the landlord can deny the tenant statutory compensation (currently the rateable value of the premises) if there has been a change of ownership during the last five years of the term prior to its expiration and the assignee is not a successor to the business of the assignor.
This is quite unreasonable and should be resisted as it could affect the marketability of the lease in the last five years of the term, which the tenant may find unacceptable despite the fact that its inclusion could result in a small reduction in rent on review.
9.15 Service of notices The provisions of the Law of Property Act 1925 section 196 as amended by the Recorded Delivery Service Act 1962 shall apply to the giving and service of all notices and documents under or in connection with this Lease except that section 196 shall be deemed to be amended as follows:
9.15.1 the final words of section 196(4)… "and that service…be delivered" shall be deleted and there shall be substituted"…and that service shall be deemed to be made on the [third]Working Day after the registered letter has been posted.
 "Working Days" means any day from Monday to Friday (inclusive) other than Christmas Day Good Friday and any statutory bank or public holiday
9.15.2 any notice or document shall also be sufficiently served on a party if served on solicitors who have acted for that party  in relation to this Lease or the Premises at any time within the year preceding the service of the notice or document
9.15.3 any notice or document shall also be sufficiently served if sent by telex [telephonic facsimile transmission or any other means of electronic transmission]to the party to be served (or its solicitors where 9.15.2 applies) and that service shall be deemed to be made on the day of transmission if transmitted before 4 pm on a Working Day but otherwise on the next following Working Day (as defined above) and in this clause "party" includes the Guarantor These provisions are designed to introduce certainty to the service of notices and documents and, unless a particular tenant takes exception to any aspect, they do not seem unreasonable.
Many large corporate tenants, however, prefer notices to be served at their registered office and not at individual units.
This is to avoid the possibility of an important notice not being considered important by a local shop manager.
In such circumstances, therefore, it may be prudent to include the following additional proviso: PROVIDED THAT while this Lease is vested in (Tenant's name) any notice or document to be served on the Tenant shall be served at its registered office and not at the Premises The tenant may object to the amendments suggested to be made to s 196 and wish to amend or delete them.
Clause 9.15.2 may in particular be considered objectionable and so may clause 9.15.3 for that matter.
Although not included in the precedent, the following provisos are also frequently included:
9.16 Developing neighbouring property Landlords frequently include a proviso stating that nothing contained in the lease shall prevent them from altering, adding to, refurbishing and generally executing works to neighbouring property.
Any deletion of this provision will normally be resisted vehemently by a landlord, particularly in a shopping centre, as it will not wish to have any infringement that may interfere with its development of neighbouring property.
The proviso set out below may be a fair compromise: PROVIDED THAT in so doing the Landlord shall cause as little inconvenience or disturbance to the Tenant as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and shall not prohibit or unreasonably interfere with or prevent the use of the Premises for the Permitted User In addition it may be as well for the tenant to stipulate in such a provision that any development of neighbouring or adjoining premises should not include the building of which the premises form part unless of course adequate safeguards are included to ensure that the premises do not suffer as a result.
9.17 Frustration of reinstatement Landlords sometimes include a proviso that the landlord should have the right to terminate the lease in the event of reinstatement being frustrated or delayed as a result of circumstances beyond the landlord's control.
This should ideally be dealt with under the insurance provisions, but should it appear in the provisos, the tenant should ensure that it is a bilateral right and that in any event the landlord shall not be permitted to terminate the lease until it has taken all reasonable measures to procure the rebuilding or reinstatement of the centre or the part so destroyed or damaged (as appropriate).
9.18 Value Added Tax There will now most likely be a proviso contained in the lease to the effect that any sums specified in the lease are exclusive of VAT and that any obligation of the tenant in the lease to make any payment to the landlord shall include an obligation to pay in addition any VAT that may be chargeable.
There is a great temptation to delete such a provision, but this would not find favour with the landlord and is therefore not worthwhile.
The present unsatisfactory state of the law relating to VAT could mean that VAT paid by the tenant may not be recoverable, and therefore the tenant should consider amending such a provision to provide that it will only pay VAT on such sums where it is first presented with a valid VAT invoice in the tenant's name.
9.19 Rights of light There may be a proviso to the effect that the tenant cannot complain if its light is subsequently affected by any building works  being carried out by the landlord to neighbouring property.
The very least that the tenant should tolerate is a proviso that the light to the premises should not be "materially" affected by any such works.
9.20 Limitation on liability Before leaving the provisos it may be worthwhile to include the following additional proviso: On an assignment of this Lease in pursuance of the Landlord's licence authorising the assignment the Landlord shall forthwith at the assignor's cost release the assignor from its future liability under this Lease in such form as the Landlord shall reasonably require Although this is unlikely to find favour with the landlord, it should perhaps be considered having regard to a recession and the outcry from tenants who, having assigned their leases, are being called upon to pay accumulating back rents as a result of the insolvency of the current tenant.
This is caused by the doctrine of privity of contract by which an original tenant (or subsequent tenant who has given direct covenants to the landlord) will remain liable under the covenants in the lease throughout the term (unless released by the landlord) and therefore can be called upon to pay back rents or remedy breaches of covenant, where default has occurred.
Those against the doctrine argue that it is unfair on the basis that the landlord has accepted the new tenant and therefore should release the old.
Those in favour of its retention state first that both parties are aware of the rules at the outset and second that, while a landlord has an absolute discretion whether or not to proceed with the grant of a lease to an original tenant, its discretion is diminished in the case of an assignee where its refusal to grant a licence to assign may be contested by the tenant, with subsequent expensive court proceedings.
This doctrine is currently under review but if an alteration is proposed it is thought unlikely that the proposal would be to scrap the doctrine altogether.
9.21 Provisions re-entry Almost all modern commercial leases contain provisions for the landlord and other persons to enter the premises for various reasons.
Such entry could be extremely disruptive to the tenant and the following proviso may be advisable: Anyone entering the Premises under any of the provisions contained in this Lease shall only do so if the purpose of such entry cannot reasonably be achieved otherwise than by effecting entry on to the Premises and any person or persons entering the Premises pursuant to the provisions of this Lease shall cause the minimum of disturbance to the business being carried on in the Premises and shall not in any event prevent such business from being carried on and shall forthwith make good all damage caused by such entry 
Guarantor's Covenants
Introduction
It is very difficult to muster a cogent argument against the landlord's request for guarantors either on the grant of a lease or on an assignment of the lease where a corporate tenant or corporate assignee has either recently been established or is a concern of limited substance.
Where the tenant is an individual or individuals, a guarantor covenant should be resisted.
Where the original tenant is not required to provide a guarantor but the alienation provisions permit the landlord to require a guarantor on an assignment if it is reasonable to do so, some landlords and tenants prefer the form of the guarantor's covenants not to be set out in the lease but to rely upon what is reasonable at the time of the assignment, presumably to ensure that the state of the art is employed.
This could be dangerous from the tenant's point of view and it is far better to settle the form of the guarantor's covenants at the outset.
The question as to whether the original tenant is prepared to join a guarantor or guarantors to the lease, particularly having regard to the frequency of periods of recession, is something which must be carefully considered.
With leases quite often running for terms of 25 years and with rent reviews multiplying "manageable" rents, an individual who is joined as a guarantor at the commencement of a lease could be made bankrupt several years after the original tenant has parted with the lease.
Even if the original tenant is forced to join a guarantor, it may be advisable for the guarantor's covenant to be amended to provide for the guarantor's liability to cease on an assignment by the tenant.
This is something which will be subject to negotiation with the landlord and an appropriate amendment can be made to the guarantor's covenants or a proviso added.
As mentioned under clause 5.9 it may not be in the original  tenant's best interests for a subsequent guarantor to be able to limit its liability in this manner and therefore if the original guarantor negotiates such a limitation, a specific reference to it should be made in the guarantor's covenants with care being taken that it is not a general limitation applicable to subsequent guarantors.
8 The guarantor's covenants
The Guarantor's covenants with the person named in clause 1.1.1 and without the need for any express assignment with all [its]successors in title that:
8.1 To pay observe and perform During the Term the Tenant shall punctually pay the rents and observe and perform the covenants and other terms of this Lease and if at any time during the Term the Tenant shall make any default in payment of the rents or in observing or performing any of the covenants or other terms of this Lease the Guarantor will pay the rents and observe or perform the covenants or terms in respect of which the Tenant shall be in default and make good to the Landlord on demand and indemnify the Landlord against all losses damages costs and expenses arising or incurred by the Landlord as a result of such non-payment non-performance or non-observance notwithstanding:
8.1.1 any time or indulgence granted by the Landlord to the Tenant or any neglect or forbearance of the Landlord in enforcing the payment of the rents or the observance or performance of the covenants or other terms of this Lease or any refusal by the Landlord to accept rents tendered by or on behalf of the Tenant at a time when the Landlord was entitled (or would after the service of a notice under the Law of Property Act 1925 section 146 have been entitled) to re-enter the Premises
8.1.2 that the terms of this Lease may have been varied by agreement between the parties [provided such variation is not prejudicial to the Guarantor]
8.1.3 that the Tenant shall have surrendered part of the Premises in which event the liability of the Guarantor under this Lease shall continue in respect of the part of the Premises not so surrendered after making any necessary  apportionments under the Law of Property Act 1925 Section 140 and
8.1.4 any other act or thing by which but for this provision the Guarantor would have been released [other than a variation of the terms of this Lease agreed between the parties that is prejudicial to the Guarantor]Until the case of P & A Swift Investments v Combined English Stores Group plc it was believed that the benefit of a guarantor's covenants could only be enforced by a successor in title to the landlord's reversion, where there had been an express assignment to it.
This case now establishes that such covenants will run with the land and that it is only necessary for the lease to provide that the expression "the landlord" includes its successors in title.
See the comment under clause 3.8 with regard to the limitation on the guarantee's liability where the "Term" is not stated to include a statutory continuation of the tenancy.
Clause 8.1.1 is so worded to circumvent the problem by which any time given by a creditor to a debtor could have the effect of releasing the guarantor from its obligations.
The latter part of this subclause is inserted to try to avoid the difficulty that could arise where a landlord declines to accept rent in order not to waive a breach of covenant by the tenant, which it has been suggested could have a similar effect of releasing the guarantor, but this is not certain.
The optional words in brackets in subclause 8.1.2 should be included for obvious reasons, and it is suggested that if those words were included then so should the words at the end of subclause 8.1.4 so as to avoid a conflict.
Subclause 8.1.3 is included as otherwise the guarantor would be released where the tenant surrenders part of the premises.
8.2 To take Lease following disclaimer If at any time during the Term the Tenant (being an individual) shall become bankrupt or (being a company) shall enter into liquidation and the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator shall disclaim this Lease the Guarantor shall if the Landlord shall by notice within [60]days after such disclaimer so require take from the Landlord a Lease of the Premises for the residue of the Contractual Term which would have remained had there been no disclaimer at the Rent then being paid under this Lease and subject to the same covenants and terms as in this Lease (except that the Guarantor shall not be required to procure that any other person is made a party to the Lease as guarantor) such new Lease to take effect from the date of such disclaimer and in such case the Guarantor shall pay the costs of such new Lease and execute and deliver to the Landlord a counterpart of it This provision is inserted to avoid the fact that a disclaimer of a lease by a trustee in bankruptcy or a liquidator will give rise to the release of the guarantor from the date of the disclaimer.
The tenant should ensure that the landlord is not given too long to make up its mind and the period of 60 days suggested by the precedent seems fair to both sides.
The tenant should also ensure that this covenant contains a provision that the lease being granted to the guarantor does not itself provide for a new guarantor to be joined.
8.3 To make payments following disclaimer If this Lease shall be disclaimed and for any reason the Landlord does not require the Guarantor to accept a new Lease of the Premises in accordance with clause 8.2 the Guarantor shall pay to the Landlord on demand an amount equal to [the difference between any money received by the Landlord for the use or occupation of the Premises and]the rents [in both cases]for the period commencing with the date of such Disclaimer and ending on whichever is the earlier of the following dates:
8.3.1 the date [6]months after such Disclaimer and
8.3.2 the date (if any) upon which the Premises are relet This provision is frequently included in guarantors' covenants, probably to cover the position where the landlord has no objection to taking back the premises with a view to a future letting, but in the meantime to secure some form of rental income.
The tenant should ensure that a reasonable cut-off date is inserted and the tenant could try to reduce the suggested six months period to three months.
Some precedents also provide for the tenant to assign the unexpired residue of the term to the guarantor where the guarantor has been required to make any payment under the guarantor's covenants.
It is for the tenant to decide whether it would wish such  a provision to be included, possibly after discussion with its guarantor, and if so, the landlord's consent would also be required.
Execution of Deeds
At the end of the body of the lease prior to the schedules there will be what is known as the testimonium and, while there is in law no necessity for a testimonium, one is almost invariably included.
The old form of the testimonium was usually as follows: IN WITNESS whereof the parties hereto have caused their common seals (for corporations) to be hereunto affixed the day and year first before written or IN WITNESS whereof the parties hereto have hereunto placed their hands and seals (for individuals) the day and year first before written Section 1 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 coupled with s 36A of the Companies Act 1985 have introduced changes to the execution of deeds by providing that a document shall not be a deed unless it is clear on its face that it is intended to be a deed.
Furthermore, deeds made by individuals need no longer be sealed, although they may seal if they wish to do so, and deeds made by a company need only be signed by a director and the company secretary (or by two directors) and, provided that the deed is expressed to be executed by the company, then it has the same effect as if it was executed under the company's seal.
Unfortunately, problems still remain with regard to delivery and it seems that in the case of an individual delivery will still be necessary as the old law still applies, with the result that a document will be treated as delivered when it is clear that it was intended by one of the parties that he was to be bound by the terms of the document.
In the case of a company delivery is still necessary and a document is presumed to have been delivered on its execution unless the contrary is proved.
The testimonium should therefore read as follows: IN WITNESS whereof this Deed has been executed by the parties hereto and is intended to be and is hereby delivered on the day first before written 
The Premises
Introduction
It is absolutely vital for the tenant to ensure that the premises are correctly described in the lease and that the rights granted are sufficient for the tenant to carry on its business and the exceptions and reservations do not adversely affect the premises or the business.
The premises The Premises means the unit referred to in clause 1.3 shown [for the purposes of identification only]edged [red]on the Plan including:
FIRST SCHEDULE
1 the floor and ceiling finishes (but not any other part) of the floor slabs and ceiling slabs that bound the Premises
2 the inner half severed medially of the internal non-load bearing walls that divide the Premises from the adjoining unit[s] in the Centre or from the Retained Parts
3 the whole of the shop front
4 the doors and windows and door and window frames at the Premises
5 all additions and improvements to the Premises
6 all the Landlord's fixtures and fittings and fixtures of every kind which shall from time to time be in or upon the Premises (whether originally fixed or fastened to or upon the Premises or otherwise) except any such fixtures installed by the Tenant that can be removed from the Premises without defacing the Premises 
7 all Pipes that are in or on and that exclusively serve the Premises and
8 any equipment or apparatus (for air extraction or otherwise) that is in or on and that exclusively serves the Premises It is essential that the premises are accurately described in the lease and the tenant should liaise closely with its surveyor for this purpose.
The precedent suggests the inclusion of a plan and, while it is suggested that where the premises are clearly defined there is no necessity for a plan, there is little doubt that a plan stated to be for identification purposes (and thereby preventing the plan from prevailing over the verbal description) is advisable.
What is included in the definition of the premises depends very much on the nature of the premises and the building.
This lease is of course a lease of part of the building and therefore the structure has been excluded.
The tenant will certainly wish to ensure that its own fixtures and fittings are excluded from the definition of the premises, which could otherwise have adverse consequences so far as the tenant is concerned when construing the tenant's covenants and valuing "the Premises" for rent review purposes.
One other point worth mentioning is that when dealing with a lease of the whole of a building, the landlord and the tenant will have to consider whether the airspace above the building is to be included or excluded from the demise, as without specific reference it seems that a lease of a building will include the airspace above it, at least to such height as may be necessary for the use and enjoyment of the land and any structure upon it.
SECOND SCHEDULE Rights granted The tenant must make absolutely certain that there are full and sufficient rights available to it so that the premises can be enjoyed for the whole of the term for any purpose currently permitted by the lease or to which the premises may be put with the landlord's consent.
The general law in fact implies various rights and easements, but it is bad practice and quite dangerous to rely on this, and all necessary rights should therefore be specifically spelled out.
1 Common parts The right for the Tenant and all persons expressly or by implication authorised by the Tenant (in common with the Landlord and all other persons having a like right) to use the Common Parts for all proper purposes in connection with the use and enjoyment of the Premises provided that the Landlord shall not be obliged to keep the malls and other pedestrian ways open [to the general public]earlier than [one hour]before the Shop Opening Hours or later than [one hour]after the Shop Opening Hours It will be for the landlord and the tenant to negotiate shop opening hours at the commencement of the term and which from the tenant's point of view should be sufficient for the tenant to carry on its normal trade and business.
2 Pipes The right to free passage and running (subject to temporary interruption for repair alteration or replacement) of water sewage gas electricity telephone and other services or supplies to and from the Premises in and through the Pipes that now serve the Premises presently laid in on under or over other parts of the Centre and (if any) the Adjoining Property (in common with the Landlord and other persons having a like right) The tenant should ensure that the grant of a right to use the service media should extend not only to the service media in existence at the date of the lease but also to those which may be provided during the course of the lease, subject of course to the perpetuity provisions.
In addition, there should if possible be a right to enter upon adjoining premises to make connections and for the purpose of repair.
This right should accordingly be amended as follows: The right to free passage and running (subject to temporary interruption for repair alteration or replacement) of water sewage gas electricity telephone and all other services or supplies to and from the Premises in and through the Pipes that now (or at any time during the Term) serve the Premises presently (or at any time during the Term) laid in on under or over other parts of the Centre and (if any) the Adjoining Property (in common with the Landlord and other persons having a like right) together with the right to enter the other parts of the Centre and (if any) the Adjoining Property to make connections to the Pipes and to inspect and repair such connections
3 Support The right of support and protection for the benefit of the Premises as is now enjoyed from all other parts of the Centre It is suggested that this right strengthens the landlord's covenant for quiet enjoyment, and the only question is as to whether to extend it to include 'shelter", but this is probably unnecessary.
In addition to the above rights, and those which the tenant would be advised to require as a result of the nature of the premises and the centre to cover such matters as access, stairs and passages, lifts, sanitary facilities and car parking, the tenant should also consider amending the lease to include the following right:
4 Entry The right for the Tenant and all persons expressly or by implication authorised by the Tenant to enter upon other parts of the Centre and (if any) the Adjoining Property to carry out works to the Premises where such works would otherwise not be possible, or may be possible but rendered more expensive than they would otherwise be if this right was available The problem of access over a neighbour's land has been greatly alleviated by the passage of the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992 which sets out a procedure whereby a person may obtain a court order permitting access to a neighbour's property in order to carry out works to protect, repair or maintain their property in circumstances where the neighbour refuses consent to such access.
It would appear that tenants are bound by the provisions of the Act and could therefore be affected adversely by it, but it remains to be seen as to whether a tenant in such a position could maintain an action against its landlord for breach of the landlord's covenant for quiet enjoyment where there is no reservation of such a right of access in the tenant's lease.
THIRD SCHEDULE Rights reserved These may be extremely disruptive and, as such, may need to be given careful consideration by the tenant.
1 Use of pipes The right to the free and uninterrupted passage and running of water sewage gas electricity telephone and other services or supplies from and to other parts of the Centre or any Adjoining Property in and through the Pipes which now are or may during the Term be in under or over the Premises This is a standard reservation and the tenant may wish to ascertain at the outset just exactly which are the pipes at the commencement of the term that will be the subject of this right.
2 Construction of pipes The right to construct and to maintain in on under or over the Premises at any time during the Term any Pipes for the benefit of any other part of the Centre or any Adjoining Property This is not a standard right and could be highly disruptive.
The tenant should consider its deletion, particularly where the premises form part of a shopping centre and the other units have already been constructed or are about to be so.
3 Access
3.1 The right at [any time during the Term or reasonable times and upon reasonable notice except in cases of emergency]to enter (or in cases of emergency to break and enter) the Premises:
3.1.1 to inspect the condition and the state of repair of the Premises
3.1.2 to inspect cleanse connect to repair remove replace with others alter or execute any works whatever to or in connection with the Pipes easements or services referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule 
3.1.3 to view the state and condition of and repair and maintain the Centre where such viewing or work would not otherwise be reasonably practicable
3.1.4 to carry out work or do anything whatever comprised within the Landlord's obligations in this Lease
3.1.5 to take schedules or inventories of fixtures and other items to be yielded up on the expiry of the Term and
3.1.6 to exercise any of the rights granted to the Landlord by this Lease
3.2 The right with the Surveyor and any person acting as the third party determining the Rent in default of agreement between the parties under the provisions for rent review contained in this Lease at [any time or convenient hours and on reasonable prior notice]to enter and to inspect [and measure]the Premises for all purposes connected with any pending or intended step under the 1954 Act or the implementation of the above provisions Any right of access given to the landlord is likely to be disruptive to the tenant's business unless exercised outside normal business hours and in accordance with an arrangement previously settled by the landlord with the tenant.
Unfortunately, certain landlords tend to abuse rights of access and as a first step the tenant should ensure that the right is subject to reasonable notice and may only be exercised at reasonable times, except of course in cases of emergency.
The suggested proviso under clause 9.21 is designed to give the tenant some comfort in respect of paragraph 3.1.1, which could otherwise be disruptive.
Paragraph 3.1.5 could be annoying if the landlord is of an interfering disposition, and could be preceded by the words:(in the last 6 months of the Term) The optional words in respect of convenient hours and reasonable prior notice in paragraph 3.2 are of course preferred.
4 Scaffolding The right to erect scaffolding for [any purpose connected with or related to the Centre or the purpose of repairing or cleaning the Centre]notwithstanding that such scaffolding may temporarily restrict the access to or use and enjoyment of the Premises This right is included in order to overcome the problem resulting from Owen v Gadd where the Court of Appeal held that the construction of scaffolding poles in front of a shop, where there was no reservation of such a right, infringed the landlord's covenant for quiet enjoyment.
It is fair to say that scaffolding placed in front of premises is extremely detractive and the following amendments to this paragraph may be advisable: The right to erect scaffolding for the purpose of repairing or cleaning the Centre provided that there shall not be erected any scaffolding or other structures in front of or to the rear or sides (if applicable) of the Premises in such a position so as [materially]to obscure the windows of the Premises or so as to prevent or [unreasonably]interfere with access to the Premises by customers or other persons entering the Premises or in connection with the servicing thereof
5 Support etc The rights of light air support protection shelter and all other easements and rights now or after the date of this Lease belonging to or enjoyed by other parts of the Centre The following proviso should be added at the end of this paragraph: provided that such rights and easements shall not [adversely]or [materially]affect the Premises or the business being carried on therein
6 Light Full right of liberty at any time after the date of this Lease to alter or to erect new structures within or adjoining the Centre (such expression here excluding the Premises) in such manner as the Landlord shall think fit notwithstanding the fact that the same may obstruct affect or interfere with the amenity of or access to the Premises or the passage of light and air to the Premises It may be as well to include the words in parenthesis to remove any suggestion that the landlord may have the right to alter the  premises.
The other point to consider is that any interference with the light and air to the premises could adversely affect the tenant's business and the tenant should consider the latter part of this paragraph being amended as follows: provided that the same shall not [materially]obstruct affect or interfere with the amenity of or access to the Premises or the passage of light and air to the Premises
