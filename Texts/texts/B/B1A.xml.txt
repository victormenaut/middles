SHIRLEY VALENTINE
People are using the words Oscar and Pauline Collins in the same sentence.
She plays the eponymous heroine who leaves Liverpool and her chips and egg hubby (Bernard Hill) and heads for Greece, where she discovers sun, fun and Tom Conti.
‘…one of the brightest, bawdiest, no-bull woman characters in years…
Pauline Collins is a marvel, funny and touching.’
Peter Travers, Rolling Stone 
25–3 MARCH SUN–SAT
BETTY BLUE
‘Beineix dares much, pushing farce as far as it will go while simultaneously building the momentum that catapults the film into its tragic destination.
The result is a staggeringly bold achievement.
Erotic, neurotic, emotionally stimulating, hysterically funny and dangerously obsessive,Betty Blue is a brilliant and wounding masterpiece.
Transcendent and utterly captivating.’
The Face 
4–10 MAR SUN–SAT
HEATHERS
Looks, money, a penchant for power and a great wardrobe — they're what it takes to make it to the top.
And they're attributes possessed in ultra-abundance by The Heathers , an elite clique of vacuous High School beauties who specialise in ‘being popular’ and making life hell for socially inadequate ‘dweebettes’and ‘pillowcases’.
Veronica (Winona Ryder), unhappy with the whole snobbery schtick, and her broody biker boyfriend J.D. (Christian Slater) devise a drastic plan to undermine the teen-queen tyranny…
There are several stylish set-pieces and more imaginative slang than you could shake a  cheer-leaders ass at.
‘The film's sharp sword has many edges, all of them razor sharp.’
Variety 
4–10 MARCH SUN–SAT
9½ Weeks
9½ Weeks depicts the sexual encounters between a sultry, naive New York art dealer (Kim Basinger) and a perverse Wall Street whizz-kid (Mickey Rourke).
His teasing request, ‘Will you do this for me?’, cues in a series of sexual variations; games in earnest that grow increasingly out of hand.
As the risk of passion escalate, self-images collide.
11–17 MAR SAT–SUN
BLACK RAIN
Dishonoured detective Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) and his easy-going partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) escort a desperately ruthless yazuka from New York to Osaka.
When he is snatched from under their noses, they join forces with the Japanese police to recover their man.
Most of the interplay is between Conklin, under investigation back home, and his Japanese colleague (Ken Takakura), who upholds group loyalty over American individualism…
Ridley Scott compensates for the clanking concept of culture-clash cops with customary confidence.
11–17 MAR SUN–SAT
THE HITCHER
There's a killer on the road.
When Howell picks him up at dawn on a deserted Texan highway he immediately makes his intentions plain by scaring the boy witless.
When the boy fights back however, then the hitcher has found what he truly needs — a decent adversary — and the game begins.
If you can swallow the unlikely nature of the killer's powers, then you are in for a good rough ride down a murky road.

18–24 MAR SUN–SAT
JESUS OF MONTREAL
Arcand's witty, thought-provoking movie upset a few people at Cannes, where it was the best film on show.
The story is simple; the ramifications complex.
A small theatre group takes on the task of mounting a Passion Play in Montreal.
Their lead actor-director transforms the stuffy original into a modern telling of the Passion.
A hit with critics and the public, it fails to amuse the Church.
The results are initially predictable — then tragic.
‘Arcand directs his own screenplay and a fine ensemble cast with fluency and brilliance.’
London Film Festival 
18–24 MAR SUN–SAT
PARIS TEXAS
‘With the almost too beautiful images of America captured by Robby Muller and a perfect fusion of image and sound achieved by Ry Cooder and stunning performances from all the cast, I am left with hopelessly inadequate superlatives.
Paris Texas , quite simply, brings magic back into cinema.’
Derek Malcolm,The Guardian 
25–31 MAR SUN–SAT
THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER
It comes as no surprise to learn that it took director Peter Greenaway a very long time to find a film company that would consider his script for more than 30 seconds.
This throat-gripping melodrama about ‘sex, greed and violence in our consumerist society — how everything passes from the mouth to the anus,’ has a cast that includes Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon, Richard Bohringer, costumes by Jean Paul Gaultiere, stunning photography by Sasha Vierny and a score by Michael Nyman, ‘the film — rich, intelligent, dynamic and funny — looks magnificent and confirms Greenaway as being in the forefront of European directors.’

WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS?
Question: what did Spanish film-maker Aldomovar do before he achieved world domination and became the trendiest thing on the planet?
The answer is of course What Have I Done to Deserve This?, made before his international hits Law of Desire and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown .
I has all his trademarks and more: male impotence and self-importance; female oppression and revenge; and acerbic wit that cuts swathes through any passing target.
Gloria (Carmen Maura) has problems.
Here slobbish husband is obsessed with an ex-Nazi chanteuse; one son is a dope dealer and the other likes to sleep with his schoolmate's fathers; her mother in law keeps a lizard called ‘Money’.
Things couldn't get any worse until they all get involved in a plot to forge Hitler's letters…
