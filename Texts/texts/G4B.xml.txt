Thursday hmm about twelve Ann.
But the way things look to me, it looks as though your thyroid gland's beginning to slow down.
And this is why you're  whole lot's 
Mm.
all beginning to puff up.
Mhm.
And your f your particular just under here.
I see the difference in you under there.
Mm.
And your, your whole face is a bit puffed, but mostly round about there.
And that, along with your tiredness all the time,
Mm.
that kind of thing.
That's very very like what happens with the thyroid.
When that starts to slow down.
And if it is, there's no great problem with that, that's very straightforward, we can get that put right for you.
Now, don't change your diet.
Mhm.
Right?
Don't go buying anything at the chemist to try and lose weight, cos they won't work.
Okay?
Mhm.
We'll get that sorted out, but we'll check this first to make sure there isn't anything else Ann.
But it looks a fairly straightforward thing.
Mhm.
We'll get you sorted out, turn you into a human being again.
a zombie.
instead of, instead of walking about like a zombie.
Aye, a heavy 
But er 
zombie.
And  right, er if you give me a phone about  twelve on Thursday morning,
Mhm.
we should have that result back, be able to tell you what's happening.
Okay?
Mhm.
We'll keep things right for you.
Okay Ann?

Thanks.
Right.
Okay now.
