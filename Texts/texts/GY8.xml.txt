What shall I do with you then?
Well I, do you mean for me?
Yeah, yeah.
Well I, I've come for b blood pressure.
those 
Right, let's have a look, oh yes.
That's right.
tablets you gave me 
That's right.
I, I don't want to see any more of them.
Oh dear I'm sorry to hear that.
After after a fortnight I couldn't walk up the street without stopping for a breather.
They made you short of breath?
Ooh terrible.
Right, okay.
Oh dear.
And er I couldn't I mean I do a lot of gardening there were n no problems at all, so I took them t well you can see what's left.
So you've stopped them?
I took thirteen and I've got some of me old  Diodide so went back on to them.
I, I think that was entirely the right thing to do, entirely the right thing to do.
Well I'm sorry about that.
Every time I sat down I went to sleep.
Oh well, that's no good then is it?
And er, No.
Okay, let me check what it is today.
It, I mean it has been going up rather high, this has been 
Yeah.
a problem of course.
Let 
Yeah.
me see what it is and there's a chance it's actually down
Yeah,
Because of the  Etenalol but er
But it's two 
Let's have a look.
weeks since I took any of those.
Well it's certainly right that you ought to stop anything that makes you feel worse.
And 
Yeah.
it's er
No pain at all 
No.
but you know, walking  I've had to stop twice.
Well that's no use is it?
That's what?
No apparent reason.
Okay, this'll squeeze your arm a bit  

Any ankle swelling or palpitations?
No I've nothing, any palpitations, nothing, I feel as fit as I did twenty years ago.
I've got two great  I do,I'm always cycling I never, very seldom ride anyway on buses and I ain't got no car, no  car.
And I feel as tip-top, I can eat, I've no bowel trouble or nothing.
Yeah.
I can sleep, eat.
Good.
Your blood pressure is still up,
Yeah.
a bit.
Yeah.
It's not up an awful lot but it is still up a bit.
And I'm sure it'd be well worth er, er getting this down, no.
Dies are you back on  Diesiodinate doing the trick 
Well I've been taking them yeah,
What I, what I suggest we do is we take this opportunity of having to review, to sort of have a complete overview and actually do, run a few er routine blood tests at this stage as well.
Okay?
I would erm  suggest what we do is we stop the  Dieside and put in something else, you know, just to keep you on on I don't really want to have you on a combination of lots 
No.
of drugs.
No, no.
I'd rather just have you on one preparation and then we see what happens.
Now the question is, what is erm going to be the most suitable for you?
Hmm.
I think what we'll do  is try this, which is called  Doxazocin there you go, that's an instantly forgettable name for you.
Yeah , yeah.
Mm.
Okay, but it does have the advantage in it, it's a has it's a very clean drug.
Yeah.
It's a very clean, so side effects are very very rare, that's right,Now we, I'm going to give you two sizes, cos you need to start on the lower dose first.
Yeah 
And what I would do, have you had your  Dieside today?
Yes.
Okay, doesn't matter, your blood pressure's still up.
What I should do is take the first one tonight.
Yes.
Because what new drugs can do is they can put your blood pressure down quite quickly.
Which means if you're standing up, you 
Yeah.
can get rather faint and wobbly.
Yeah.
So if you take the first one immediately before you go to bed, if your blood pressure does go down rather a lot, it doesn't matter cos you're lying down, you'll 
Yeah.
be fine.
And if you're okay, you can carry on taking one in the morning.
One in the morning 
Okay?
And the seven days at the low dose and then I'd like you to go onto the slightly higher dose, which is still a low dose,
Yeah.
for the rest of the time.
And then we can bri check your blood pressure back.
So,
if that's okay, that's what we'll do.
Yeah.
Stop the  Dieside 
Yes.
take these back to the chemist,
Yes.
and if you can see our practice nurse in a few weeks
Yes.
okay, and then see me in about five weeks,
Right, okay.
something like that.
Then we can 
How will
have a look at the blood tests 
Yeah.
I'll write down what I want her to do,
Mm.
we can have a look at the blood tests, we can see what the blood pressure is.
If you have any side effects from the new ones, then you should come back straight 
Yes.
away.
Right.
Okay?
Yeah.
But I think, I'd be very surprised if you do, so  so
Shall I know which is which in the tablets,
Yes they'll be clearly labelled.
Yeah.
Mhm.
And I think I'll ask her to do an electrical tracing of your heart, just for completeness as well,
Yeah.
I think.
Okay.
Now then it's , isn't it??
That's right, yeah.
Well I've been on them  Diodides for six year now.
Yeah I know, but your blood pr I mean they did d they were doing you very well but blood pressure does tend to rise, as you get older 
Yeah yeah.
and I think that's what  
Probably if it hadn't have been for Sister Helen and I would have never have been able to b catch the  at all because I never came to see a doctor.
You d then we, we'd have er we'd have 
 
summoned you by now, don't worry.
You think so?
Oh yes.
Ah ah.
I'm saying years ago my old dad, he, he were eighty nine and he never had a blood test in his life.
Well
Pressure or anything.
if you go back even 
You think I could have some of that I pu i m  Melorose or something, for dry eyes.
I, I have got it on the prescription I had to get it Doctor  sent me to the hospital,
Yeah.
and there's nothing wrong with my eyes at all, they said  dry.
Ju dry yeah I'll put one of those on for you.
Cos they're a bit irritable at night.
Yeah okay.
If you only go back ten fifteen years, it wasn't realized fully how many problems are out there,
Yeah,
that don't cause people any symptoms until something happens and it's too late.
That's right, yeah.
Er that's becoming more recognized, which is why we do more routine things on people who appear fa yeah, it 
Yeah, that's right,.
So as you say years at  I'm 
No no, I mean 
so ill because I couldn't afford it 
No no.
but I   
Well sometimes we overdo I think, but anyway.
So there's, there's two sixes.
Yeah.
The little ones there's only seven of and that's 
Yes.
one a day.
Yes.
And I said, if you take the first dose tonight.
Yes.
I j write that, the first dose, dose tonight.
Tonight, yeah.
And then
If I take  if I take one at night 
after that, it's  
have I to take another one in the morning?
If you're okay , yes, yeah.
 
And if you feel completely weak and wobbly,
Yes.
then we better see you before you have any more.
That 
 
has never happened  to me yet, first dose problems 
No, no no  
but it's something to be slightly aware of, so
And if I can see, if you say you've had the blood test done in around, I dunno, two weeks, at your convenience and then if you see me in about five, which will be at the end of those, which  
So  arrangements to have a blood test then,
Mm.
in about a fortnight?
Please, yes.
Yeah.
Okey-doke.
These, the chemist can have these back?
Yes, please, he can then dispose of them.
 

I'm sorry about that but er  is this yours?
Well I, I wondered.
Yes, I
Yes, don't forget that.
I wondered what was going on really, because I mean it just  at least I can take them  
Yeah, yeah.
It's  
got the wife worried,
It's not a common it isn't a common problem at all that.
No
Okay?
Yes,
