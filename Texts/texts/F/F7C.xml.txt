No
No, right
Ah
they won't do
they won't do a thing for the children in their old blind school because R B E A have got so much money we don't put our  
Yes, aha, yes 
money into the school
Mhm
cos there they can do it themselves 
I agree they shouldn't buy the tickets because they're the 
They shouldn't 
ones that have provided us, have a go at  
They are loaded they're loaded
Well there is other things they do want you on special, er pantomime before the school breaks up you know 
They of course 
Mhm
perhaps we could organize it or something
A target one for kids and one for
Yes
Yeah
A standard audience
We should get back to R B A, they're the ones who supply the equipment
Yeah
Mhm
they've got one of them
and that, none of their children go, maybe, maybe that's a way
Absolutely
to do it.
Well I think that would be worth looking into
Yes
Right, definitely 
if Brian could make the sort of
Oh contact the 
Oh yes that's a good idea 
Yes, yes get a letter out and come back to me  
What about, to go back to the idea of scheduling and things
Mhm
Scheduling, yes
I mean
Yes Doris is seeing to that 
the difficulty is is we need a mechanism, but the 
Yes 
difficulty is we, what we I think need to do is, is establish who is actually arranging dates
Mhm
Yes
I mean, I think we're stuck, we're obviously stuck with a
on the sixth 
Oh yes, yeah 
and the thirty nine and that
Right
for the variety of reasons, but I think what's obviously important is if there is any more date arranging going on
Yes, yes
by whoever
Mm
that there is that sort, kind of, everybody keeps in touch with everybody else erm 
I think that's diff you see I, I don't think that's possible for everybody to keep in touch with everybody else, I think you've got to have one person, that everybody looks to, to say, right  
All the dates are centre that, one person is that one
I mean it could work on that basis then, that if, for example, I'm just thinking about, well just from my point of view, when i was arranging that date in Stirling with the Oxford people, I could of said well, Thursday's okay with me is it okay with you until I've checked with
Mhm
whoever it is upstairs
Right
kind of thing
Mhm and provided it's only one person it's not that difficult
It's not that difficult
It's not you see because every person  
Have to check it with everybody 
Yes, you'll have to buy a chart for that one person
Yes, the only thing is that, that in, in each city now
Mm
well Glasgow and Edinburgh anyway cos
that's the other thing now
you need perhaps someone in each area to be coordinating
again yes
all the de you know, because they've got the describers, whoever is in charge of the describers knows when they can spare people, oh no I can't do that week because we've 
Right 
already got tied up
Yes, that's right
so it really has to be the person in each city erm who then gets together with a general coordinator.
For this in Edinburgh there is a sort of a forum where er organizations are set themselves round the table and say this is what, the sort of idea that we're gonna do for the next year and a half
Right
Mhm, yes 
so that we don't clash with each other statistically
Yes
So you don't have
so we could take it from that stage even
Aha yes 
Yes 
Yes that's, that's it you see
Mhm
I've been trying to spot room for that 
Is this what's erm 
Try and take it back a step yes
Aha
As a kind of clash diary
Mhm
but it's also linked, I mean the other thing that I've got at the back of my mind, is a kind of nightmare, is that when we were talking about the Festival around about March  that you know, we spoke to Ingy er you know as a group and then that was all fine and we kept er going along and then, and then there was that sort of dreadful phone call I had from Linda along the lines as I'm not sure if I've got any describers 
That's right, because it's August
Oh yes
because it's August
Yes
you know, part of me was thinking well just a minute you know this service is if blind people can offer describers, but on the other hand people are entitled to go away on holiday
Yes
Exactly, mm
and so you know it is a sort of, I mean it's exactly what Iris is saying it's a meeting with minds in a way because we need to know that, that 
Yes, because in that case you could of, we could of drawn in people, describers from Perth
Yes Connie 
who knows next year we'll be, we say Glasgow or
That's right
but, but people should also be aware that the Festival is always in August 
Yeah quite
Exactly, yes 
Yes, and, and I'm prepared to, I mean
And these people all live in Edinburgh
Yes exactly
That's why they're all tired
Rent out their houses
That's right
I mean I was thinking that you can actually with Linda actually you know because I loiter Linda today's meeting obviously
She was on holiday
and you know
Yeah  I thought that was lovely
they said she was on holiday, you know, erm and you know, so I mean
Mm
Mhm
maybe this year because it's you know the first kind of year of it
Mhm
and maybe next year people will take their holidays another time
Mm
but there are all these kind of variations to build into this problem, I mean I don't know we could, I feel we could almost talk, talk around this for, for hours
Mm
to sort of see some way around it, but I mean it's a, it's a problem of the scheduling both by the theatres
Mhm
because you know the other thing to take into this is the 
Yes 
sort of thing we've talked about as well with, with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Kings
Mhm
the Kings theatres in towns where by and large they're showing the same shows
Mm
Yes
and sometimes they go to Glasgow first
Mhm
and then they go to Edinburgh
Yes
and sometimes they go from Edinburgh to Glasgow 
And they usually go to Aberdeen
sometimes they go to Aberdeen
That's right, yes
sometimes they come to Edinburgh and then go away for six months and come back to Glasgow
Yeah
Yes, yes that's right
and I'm quite keen to sort of have that
Yes
I mean you're never going to control, you're never going to be on top of it but I mean 
No 
Oh no it's not, never, doubt it
like Alligator Gun for example I know is coming to the, to the Kings up the road here quite soon and then it's going to Glasgow later on, and I keep thinking every time this sort of thing, thing's happening I keep thinking we could be dealing with these
Mhm
we could actually be doing
Mhm
you know, erm this, sometimes they go to the Theatre Royal to complicate things, but you know,
Mm
Playhouse and things but it's different theatres, but
Yes
you know I just keep thinking the stuff's on the way round and there ought to be some way of doing it, but I, you know, I mean maybe Brian's idea of the, the, the organizations in the ci ci but that doesn't help me you know with a, with a
You still need a key person who's going to
Yes you do 
You still need, yes 
Yes
to sit on the information
Yes
I think so, there's got to be one person I mean I thought about this long and hard and there's just no way, it cannot be done by committee it would not work cos then 
No it won't 
you've got people phoning oh, but I told er Linda
Yes
oh, but I told Iris, oh but I told Jane
That's right
and you've got all this people not, you know
 
And the information just never comes
Never gets together 
Everybody 
That's right
so it's got to be one person and it's got
you're all little bits, innit?
to be soon because that's already 
Mm, be soon 
Yeah 
happened
but that's gonna happen again
Yeah, I think it'll happen again in the spring 
it's only a matter of time 
At least we've got dates here for the Lyceum for
Yes
till April
Yes and I've got Brampton till November
so we can sort of put those into our
September
I think what I personally think what you need is a coordinator in Glasgow, a coordinator in Edinburgh to get together with a general coordinator who's going to cover Perth, Stirling
Yeah
Aberdeen, erm and get together and decide what they want, discussing dates
Yeah
because the coordinator are the ones who know if they 
what's 
have to describe and
Yes and the people on the ground, well Linda is obviously the, the other recorder
Yeah
and you're obviously
I'm hoping that Wendy  's going to be
Oh
at Glasgow, yes 
If she's going to take over, well obviously if those two come together 
if she doesn't get a job , I hope she doesn't get a job, that's not very nice thing to say, she's so good, so 
You know Wendy she's so good at it these 
she'll coordinate the Glasgow ones and erm
Right
that'll save me phoning up to say can I have a script please
And that for you to take them all
That's right
Aha
Well the other thing that's in the back of my mind is I happen to know that Cath is just taking on a new worker
Mhm
would she be able to  is this a full time worker you've got?
Yes she is a full time worker 
Working beside you 
She's full time worker and er she's a clerical typists, typist so 
And so she's more or less chained to a desk then is she?
Mhm
Nine to five?
Or whatever
because that's the other problem with people like me is, I'm all over the place all the time.
Yes she can certainly 
I've only got a part time back up you see
she could certainly erm offer any, you know, assistance in whatever way  the only thing is that erm
She doesn't really know the theatres so that's the thing 
No, no, now she doesn't know any theatres and she doesn't no that's 
Yeah, you see that's , we really need someone who's involved to be honest
Mhm
Yeah
no, be honest about that, certainly doesn't, she's there, she's certainly there and can offer any assistance you know erm
I'm just thinking maybe of a central diary or something, that someone would keep, someone who you know you could relay them with phones
say what's happening on the twenty third of January
I mean I er, if Wendy is dealing is goi well perhaps going to be dealing with a 
Yes, aha 
do you feel that leaves you freer to
Well I'm freer to do, I mean I, I got, I wanted to be free because I was getting tied up with that and I was getting tied up with persons, but not agreeing everything
Mm
and I felt I was being spread in so many directions erm, that erm I wanted to get rid of the Glasgow coordination
Aha
so
You could tell the day
Yeah, mhm
Shall we try that then?
You see Iris has got an answer for you
Mhm
Yes that's another thing
and you can't say this, because I've got to say this for you 
That's right 
because you're blind Iris I've got to say because 
 
You know, I mean, I'm just thinking out loud, it has to be someone that you can leave messages with
Mhm
so that's the thing 
You've got to get hold of them too
You've got to be able to 
Yes, aha 
erm, I certainly am worried about it, cos I can see, and see when it starts getting out of hand like this, see
Yes, yes
when it starts going wrong you'll get you'll get
going ah, wait a minute
Yes exactly
Exactly
and blind people go wait a minute you know, I want to go to this and I want to go to that 
Cos the other thing that's worrying me coming up is Christmas
Yes
Oh that'll be a nightmare 
Yes 
because there's that thing
you were saying about, the visits
Visits, yes
and, and our friend in Glasgow West Society not
Oh yes
organizing tickets and
Yes
Remember last year remember all that 
the only, the only date is the sixth 
we landed up with no idea of the description, on one of the pantomime performances because he wouldn't arrange the date and then
Well I mean the thing is, as soon as the Citizens open the box office for pantomime, I phoned them and said 
Good 
open and book 
good 
now
yes
and what did he do, he didn't book now
Oh no
and the first time by 
I don't wish 
the time he phoned he could only get Friday of the first week
Oh that's hopeless for children
now I can't say no
Of course not
because we have, because it's for the children, so I said we'll do it, but that gives us an awful crush to get it in Friday the first week 
Exactly, and also it's 
and he said I have to admit I didn't act on your phone call and I felt like braining him I really did 
Surprise, surprise 
Why couldn't you of just said yes well you, well you just 
 

two years running you
Two years running, yes, last year we did two separate audio 
Last year we did two, two separate audio descriptions
He shouldn't mess it up
Well I think this is another case actually where I think in, in that 
Yes it is 
situation that, you know, hopefully by next Christmas we'll we'll maybe be a bit 
Maybe, maybe we'll get a coordinator who will just say I'll book the seats for you 
It's not far away 
Yes quite, exactly and
You owe us
Yes
We'll, we'll move it into a position where, you know, maybe we can bring the Sid, Sid on this well as well and say 
Just send the bill to Glasgow then
that's right
maybe, maybe it's something that which may emerge as well with you
Yes
if you talk successfully to the R B A 
Yes oh yes watch, watch yourself over Christmas it's very complex, yes because I mean the whole point innit is to have the audio description and also it should be, it should into the runs, so that 
Yes 
so that it is 
People will have time 
nearer, nearer to Christmas because Christmas Eve would actually be the perfect time to do for children 
Yes, exactly 
I mean children just get more and more excited
Yeah
and, and er, Alan, Alan actually said to me last year why I don't see the importance of audio description anyway
Eh 
oh well I mean that was red rag to the bull
I don't think he ever, ever has, has he?
Well I've got people on my committee who are on R B A board
Oh
and they, that's why we got the equipment of course and they all support it and Jim  supports it
Jim's
so there shouldn't be any problem
No
through that 
The chairman 
Mhm
There shouldn't be any problem, but I mean he won't  won't 
Right 
instruct the school to do anything about it
No
but we might be able to convince him.
So what we've agreed then is that,f f you're hoping that Wendy
Wendy 
is that E or I?
she actually   
Yes
she actually volunteered, ha
Oh she's sweet 
Would take over the coordinator and Linda 
Linda 
through here
Mhm
Yeah
and obviously
And my offer of help still stands for Wendy
Right,
because 
 
the typing 
that Iris will still keep the diary as it was
Yes, lovely
Iris would actually and maybe what we should do is buy a diary
Yep
and I could have it a year diary in fact
Yeah
because that's the sort of seasons you guys tell me what
Mhm
erm  and you know and that would be their kind of bible  get one with a lock on 
Yeah 
and er, you know we, we would just have to
Yes
set up that mechanism that you know
Aha, yes
everybody and, you know
Everybody checks them
everybody checks with those three people 
Yes I think so 
I mean in a way the purse thing is a bit more  distant
A slight more distant, yes
but non the less if you're
Mhm
I mean you're still gonna have a
But Stirling isn't for instance, they'll want to consider their pantomime again
Mhm
Yeah, yeah, so you know we need to sort of pull that together 
It's very important for the equipment as well if we're using the  
Yes, it's the  as well 
Exactly, yes, yes exactly 
all by and large I mean it's almost certainly 
it's getting it from one place to the next
Oh for instance, for instance 
Same equipment for the same blind people
Well come the twenty
come the twenty fourth of September
Give it to the blind and they can take the equipment
equipment in Oc in Stirling then from Glasgow back
See
induction
see
which is a nuisance
now, well it's a nuisance but thank goodness at least it's there
It's there
Yes but not they won't like you going back 
but it's, you know, it is a you won't like going back, no I don't like it either
Mm
if we had our, our second system in each city then 
There we go 
that's right
Yes, mhm
you can imagine, I mean
come in and use it as a
centre and the phone and never thinking there that
yes
that's bad
That'll help and also for any the other coordinator unless they've got a problem because er 
Well can I say then that Iris will keep a diary
Right
which is also the equipment diary, that, with back up from your
Yeah
Yes, yes, it's a lot of work
So, right I'm just wary of the time
Mm
it's twenty past three
Mm
Right
erm, moving on, erm  audio description in Scotland, no  er since this, the last meeting, yes Cath and I have been talking about all that money, we had an entertaining day out
Entertaining day out
and to cut a long story short, we went to see three possible funders, er funder one was T S B Foundation, where to cut a long story short I'm pretty sure that T S B er we, we have to put an application in for October I think we'll, we'll buy us another system 
Only because the guy had lost his sight in Korea
Mm
Oh good
good 
So you should always send me
Yes definitely definitely 
Of course 
too late 
Oh yes I think you're right
if I hadn't of been blinded he was out the door
So, er meeting number two was with Geoff  from Carniki Trust and he er welcome, welcomed 
Robert's, Robert's got a  
us very warmly and erm 
Oh yes 
Mhm 
and he's encouraged us to put an application in to do more, more so with the training side of things
Mhm
you and I will need to sort
ourselves on that, that's new
Er we just need to get the money and
Yeah erm, yeah I know it's, it's writing the application a little bit 
  
so that, that will be quite good, erm and lastly we went to meet with Sandra  from Youth Out, fund employed theatrical fund, which was a meeting we weren't really allowed to have, and this is certainly not for the record
Mhm
erm because I'd phoned up and asked for them, er my secretary had phoned up and asked for a meeting with her but the response was we're not allowed to meet with you, so we said okay, cos it's public money and things 
It'll give us the edge, public money 
and then we arrived,we arrived at
This is good 
where the Carniki Trust is in Dunfermline having just managed to get there on the petrol in the tank erm
we happened to go up the stair and er, the door was answered 
The door was shut 
by this woman, who said, you know, who are you?
What you want?
So we said were Robert  and
she sort of gave me an odd look
Aha
went away and came back and said oh Mr  will see you in a minute and it turned out it was Sandra 
because Youth and Carniki I knew are in the same building, which is why we wanted to see you
and she said while, since you are here, I can meet with you 
We won't talk to you 
I bump into a lot of people at conferences, so I haven't been able to write formally to thank you for the meeting because I don't want anything on the record then
She made us tea as well 
Oh good, I read in today's newspaper
Oh
erm on the train coming through that Esso have withdrawn the sponsorship from sports in Scotland
Oh really?
Oh
Oh really?
and they're going to concentrate on community
Ooh 
Ooh 
ooh 
I thought we're a community
Everybody likes that one 
Esso immediately
Nice one
Esso, mm
get in touch with Esso, oh yes
Small flurry of ayes
That the one with the tiger or is it Shell?
That's it
Tiger
Esso's the tiger 
Esso's the tiger 
Esso's the tiger
Esso's the tiger, yeah
Put a tiger in your audio description
Yes
Mhm
so and UFAF, UFAF is, is a, in fact UFAF I felt quite pleased about in a way because we'd, we'd analyzed Maggie  and I had analyzed the documents and Jane and I and Graham and I had spoken about it as well, that they are principally interested in unemployed volunteers
Mhm
but not impulsively, but the, what I did have a concern about and I think we'll have to be a bit careful about this as we go forward is that, the audio description project is about audio description, youth and funding is about volunteers
Yes, she's quite clear in  
whilst the two er obviously
Aha
fit together
It's the way you  
it's not quite the same
No
so it's not exactly like you're trying to put you know you're trying to put a right hand onto a left hand, but it, it's a certain element of that, erm having said that what do you think?
I mean do you think she's going to respond well?
Oh definitely, aha Donna made out about that
Yeah
she said, she's very into Alan  and she knows his work
Mhm
cos he's
I phoned Alan, erm their rehab unit
Mhm
is back to back, with Carniki in Dunfermline
Yes, that's right
so you see she sees him coming and going, she sees the blind people coming and going, so hence the kind of yeah, so is that's it
Oh I knew that 
so 
I didn't know that
so that was
alright, there you are, you see so that's information on giving out.
Share this information, so no, I think she'll help and I think he'll help erm because of you, because obviously very committed to that
Yeah
Aha
That should be quite good, but it's not enough of course 
No, I mean that, you know, that, that all kind of gets off the ground
Aha
er, what, the next thing that I've agreed with, with Mary 
Mm
is that once obviously there is a specialist application to UFAF, to, to their forms
Mm
there'd be a not quite a specialist application to Carniki, Carniki will be linked to UFAF
Mhm
due to the timing we have to apply to Carn , well the deadline for Carn Carn the deadline for UFAF comes first
Yeah
but will be considered second
Mhm
Mhm
Not till December it's not considered 
That's right , the Carniki is the deadline is end of September and they'll considered it in October
Aha I see 
but it will become Carniki decision will be conditional on UFAF application, I think
Ah, which is a bit iffy
Mhm
but should be okay
but since Geoffrey  is actually one of the UFAF trustees as well it will all quickly fit in together 
It's all intermingled, yes 
Oh yes 
But once we've agreed is, once, once I've done the work, we have done the work, I have done the work with you helping me, er I've written this application, what I want to do is turn that into a much more general one and then I can write to you know maybe twenty, twenty five trusts on a more general basis
Yes
saying you know, we need a sum of money and Mary  will help me with the marketing of that and hopefully after that we would, go on enough to keep us going, so hopefully by the time Christmas comes
Mhm
I mean we'll, we'll obviously have to sort of keep a, keep an eye on all this all the way through
Mhm
Can I say, I, I can express concern about that because I think that in terms of funding I've written A short term and B long term erm I think we've got a short term problem and
Yeah
I speak on behalf of Playback not as Playback itself, but as Playback being part of the Regional Council that can a bit, now I was at a meeting this morning where I, I sort of absolutely had to read the riot act about Playback because they do not have a set budget whether you know this or not, they don't have a standard budget as they should have, we've fought for this for years, what we do is, we survive through crisis to crisis, now some money has been extracted from the Playback budget and whilst I have to share two bits of Playback, you know, the, the actual Playback charitable, voluntary bit, and the Regional Council, I mean they, I, I can say that they do not have a backing of money that they can fall back on, too many backs there, but I mean really I would say that I would be concerned if it was Christmas before we were ready, I, I can't help but think if we could and I mean, very, very happy to work with, with anybody and everybody on this to try and get these things pulled up quite quickly, I mean if it's forms to be filled in then
Mhm
you know application and that, surely we could maybe tackle that quickly and then 
Sure, well 
we would be in a position to have this letter because I'm getting anxious, I've written a logo first and then this long term, short term and they're connected
Yeah, right
I think we need to move a bit faster 
Well when I say Christmas I mean that's actually decision, I mean we can't hurry the meeting that you've had and we can't hurry the meetings one we get 
Yes decisions, no, no, no for the actual post of
all that stuff I appreciate that, but the actual raising of money and something 
Yeah, well, no I'm thinking that these, these applications have to be in both of them by the end of September and I don't 
Yes 
see why the, the second string of the trust letters shouldn't be going out straight away after
Aha
Straight away, yes
But again you're always linked, you're always linked to 
Aha, yes cos again I'd go for assistance on that, you know 
deadlines, a lot of these trusts only meet once a quarter
I know
and you might get lucky
Mhm
Yeah
Yes
and get in
Mhm
but you might you know miss it by a week and got three months, two months, three weeks at the most
I just er, it would just be, I, I just, just would be concerned
but your
you know
Yeah, yeah
that, that Playback's left, you know, for, for a very long time because I think you'll agree and
I know it was a decision taken by Playback and that you 
Hang on Cath, Cath 
Playback had been 
now been paid back
Playback have been paid back
Have they completely?
Yes we have, yes, the same as the Edinburgh Society, yeah 
Oh well, then, I, that really takes away my short term concern then
Aha
That's fine because that wasn't running
the Edinburgh Society had given us some money, that's not me 
My clock's going bananas you know
Mine doesn't make that noise now
No, that's my clock going bananas 
Nothing over here 
Mhm
Yeah well that's fine then, sorry I take away my
I should of maybe actually asked the question 
Has Jane had enough 
first because erm
Leave it there, right
That's why you meant 
You mentioned logo there and erm I think that's where 
Now again, can we go back to that because 
but I think this, this comes down to the
RNIB, I mean if we want a logo it should be an audio description logo for the country
Yeah
For the, for everybody
don't you think so?
Yeah it should be national
A national one
Except 
Well 
except then if you're writing off for money to places like Telecom and it's a national logo
Can you not have a national logo which is kind of personal wise 
Oh I mean, I know that in America and all the different cities have their own logos
Okay
so maybe we could do that here
on the logo front when Linda wrote to me and said she couldn't come to this meeting
Yeah
she said I have enclosed a, a draft of a logo and she didn't, I have seen it because Jane's got one
Who is this?
Linda
Linda 
Linda had a contact who'd done something 
Linda had done one because remember but Alex did one way back which would not 
of course and at college 
Yes
say was wonderful, but I think we should maybe try and just gather them together and 
but the sooner , the sooner we get a logo the sooner 
soon 
I can get placards made to put above our heads 
So lovely, get it 
out there
but if we have Linda's just, just that
Mm, with information on
Yes exactly
Can you find it?
Mm, I've got it somewhere
Could you, could you maybe gather Linda's and Alex's and anybody else's that they've got
Well those are the only two, I mean Linda's, Linda's one is the more 
I'll give you one 
Oh, but, ah, well Iris's
That's three then
Yes
Three
I've got all the bits and pieces of all
Okay, well put it on the agenda next time 
Right, yes, please I think that's a wee  
I can't find Linda's 
Aha
and if people could get a copy of them all before the next meeting 
Do you have friendly relationships with a graphic designer, at this ?
Yes, yes 
we could hopefully try and make a decision
Yes, yes
I mean I couldn't care less, as long as it was something
must get something
Linda's is the mask in the theatre 
Oh yes 
Not really, but  
with headsets and erm lights
That's it, that's it
and headlights coming, you know, the
Brian has something to come up with
Oh do, do
which is
yes
Ooh
Yes
yes please 
Yes please 
because I just think it would, it's so important to get that bit, that bit goes along with the all the application bit, if we tie those two up together
Yes
I don't think we'll have a problem with money you see
Mm
but it's got to be done properly and
One of, one of the things is the, is the, I don't know what the eye is the good thing to have in the, if somehow or other
Be incorporated it
To be quite honest I quite like the iron
Yes
and I know that's a bit blind and, and I'm usually
Well
saying the opposite, but you do have to remind people what you're doing 
it's, it identifies you really quickly
Mm
yeah, mhm
It does
Mhm
Perhaps, right
well great if you can get something good, good 
If you're not so very artistic, all but seems 
Just need to come up with a brief
It was more or less something along those lines wasn't it 
Yeah I could, I could 
Something as simple as Linda's  
Linda's?
It did have, yes I, I mean it, it wasn't that, but it was something you know that
It was the masks 
theatre masks 
Should, what they were trying to do was copy the masks that you have in the
Yes
Mm
Lyceum 
And
oh so it's a Lyceum over there really.
No, no,
Personalize, personalize
Lyceum has just got a new logo I noticed
Oh don't  no
said can we have your old one?
Yes
Yes, steal it, that'll be fine, I'll steal it
No I don't know what I've done with it 
So anyway 
That's all my fault
so that's, that's the erm, the funding side of things Graham and I 
 
We gave the money back
Yes Graham and I erm, spent time talking about job descriptions which
Aha
if I haven't brought that forward, it's really irritating because I'm sure I've put
don't seem to of done, so we have done some work on job description, here, I mean it's not been typed up anyway 
Maybe send them out rather than wait till the next meeting, aha 
I'll send them out erm
That'll be good
it's only draft
Mhm
so that's done some work on that, and there's now four models for training, one is the, you know, on the job, evenings, training, there's the weekend model of getting people together for the weekend, there's the sort of summer school idea and the other one's the one that Doug keeps reminding me about, which I keep forgetting about which is the distance learning one, er we, I think this is the one he thinks is running in Dundee, that maybe help with because the idea of developing a pack which is kind of trainer proof
Mhm
so that it could be sent to the folks in Inverness
Mhm
I'm a bit weary about this but he seems to 
Yes I'm a bit weary about it 
think
Audio description at a distance
Ah yes
no I don't fancy that at 
So anyway those are the four, those are the four models, I mean at, at this stage I don't know
I mean the fourth one the fourth 
One of the, one of the 
I think the first two though, the on the job obviously
Oh how
the weekend is relatively straightforward, the summer school idea is complex and I think the distance is complex 
It's expensive 
Yeah, exactly
In some ways wh I, I, I heard, I was listening to a description on Saturday at the serials and I must admit I thought to myself mm
Yeah
we've got more work required here
Aha
Yes, so, it needs someone, I mean I'm always
hers now, sort of saying why, those, those, but you see if there's nobody to doing that in Edinburgh they're going to slip again  unfortunately.
Yes that applies to hand and that applies right throughout the country
Absolutely yes
Yeah, so we need to yeah, we're, we're sort of thinking about it
Aha
but er, how you kind of do that
The other thing I was slightly concerned about it, if it's a slight digression is the fact that the people at the Lyceum at the Assembly Hall last Saturday didn't know, hadn't been told anything about the equipment
Yeah
they didn't even know how to put the clip onto the microphone, they were sitting holding the microphones instead of slinging it round their neck, and they've never been told about the equipment, so they needn't 
I see 
I mean all of them are obviously going to need equipment explained to them
They need to understand how the equipment works, aha 
So that's part of the training 
Aha
That part, aha
Yeah  yeah  right
It's a
trouble is it's an ongoing, it's a not a bit of training it's an ongoing 
No, the only thing is the thing is the equipment is new to everyone in Edinburgh 
Of course 
and  once they've shown, if somebody new comes along one of the old hand
It'll just pass it on
Of course it'll pass on 
Will be passed on , but in this instance they all need to be shown how to work it, yes, mhm, so that concerned me a little bit, apparently because they were holding the mike right up to their mouth and it was distorting terribly  what's going on up there
So it's, it's the sort of
Mm
Mhm
improper use
Yes exactly, yes
right  so I mean there's, there's obviously more need to be thought through on that and the video I haven't, oh I have done something more about the video
Mhm
erm, I haven't, I was gonna go and, I tried phoning Lorne  one time I was going through to Glasgow just to see if I could, can I have a, can I have a pint with him or something, erm, just to chew it over cos he suggested you know he'd made various helpful suggestions, in the meantime I didn't manage to meet him, but in the meantime I did manage to speak to my father-in-law who has a camcorder and er he will be more than happy to erm, he's also got editing equipment, he would be more than happy you know, to do the home made video that we've talked about, I need to talk to him about this because the obvious place to do will be the Lyceum on one of your shows 
Can you get, can you give me the name erm, the rest of the 
through to Glasgow she was Rose  that she lecturers and dramas or something
Margaret 
Margaret , can you give me a phone number for her because I thought if they do that they must put her on plays with us students
Yeah, well that is another possibility we could
that would be ideal
Mhm
Certainly I'll
aha
Erm
but she would be ideal
Let me just put you in the picture there Brian, what, what Lorne has agreed subject to what guarantees have been given
Mhm
is that, that we as a group can, can er video the production, but it was at Perth, but in this case it would have to be
Mhm
review, erm, subject to getting on commission from the cast and director
Mhm
and all we will be talking about when my father-in-law will be coming along, he's got a tripod, he's got all the gear, it will be just that probably be plonking it on front of the ground circle actually
Mhm
erm
a bit like slinging a good, we could put it over the front
Oh that'll be even better then you'll need to talk to him 
I mean you'd asked him to do that 
I mean he's, he has been quite busy
he's retired, but he's, he's been quite busy with this Festival, but I, I said to him, now what I'll do is maybe come and you and him and Jane maybe kind of will just sort of have a quick confab sometime just talk about what he wants, and he will be kind of happy to do that with obviously we'd have to find a drop of money to pay for the tapes, I mean that wouldn't be huge and expensive.
He's also got editing equipment so it might be the sort of thing that you know like you'll be able to take it away and say you know, this section, that bit and then 
And that, that's right 
meet again with him, maybe go to his house
Yep
and spend an afternoon cutting it off as it were 
Yes
I mean if, copying those bits onto a separate tape.
Yeah.
What Lorne, has, the concern Lorne has is, is that he doesn't want that tape, finding its way out of our
Mm, yes
hands, erm, I mean he's, he's really genuinely concerned, wanting to help us, but I mean he's obviously he's, you know, he is the union
Oh yes, absolutely he's quite right about that 
and he has to represent his neighbours , erm  so erm  so we would need to guar give guarantees, I think that would have to be
have to give guarantees that the tape would not be abused, but I mean that in, in, in actuality you know, if it was you doing the training
That's right
it comes down for you and you would have to sign documents of, erm, anyway so it's 
that's great
Should be fairly easy to
Yeah
just to record straight over
Right
not necessarily on a camcorder
Right, well we can, we should, we should do that, then.
When do you start again?
I speak to Stella now
Do you speak, do you start straight after the Festival we have a gala evening?
Er eleventh
Right, well what I'll do is, if you like, that's it  this is the erm, erm  Linda
Mhm
Mhm
friend, who  I spoke to Cath
I'll date it 
No I can't and can I tell you, I'm not being funny but I think that's actually maybe quite important, I know this is not the in doubt visually impaired people but
Oh no
I think you'd have to 
oh yes 
choose something that, a person with a visual impairment might be 
Yes, aha 
able to catch
not every one is totally
but I mean, you know it'll be quite nice, it also be quite nice if it was raised
Yeah
Yes right 
then it would have a wee
with it, which would be quite nice for a visually impaired person
Mm yes
Mm
Just a thought, you know
Mhm
and I'm afraid I'm, I'm not a very artistic
person as well 
When that went into the paper, that's a similar sort of thing that they use 
 
fair, fair enough
That's what they used
Mhm
similar
Yes there's a technique for, for raising it, isn't it?
I think there must be because I've seen it several times now and just in, in, you know
Mm
people not necessarily anything to do with visual impairments paper you know
Yes
Yes, indeed
it was quite fun
Mhm 
I suppose it's always much more expensive to do 
Yes you just write over the top, sort of write over the top of it and it raises off
That's right, mm
But I, I mean, erm I suppose it's best to do it in colour 
We've got some of the stuff downstairs 
colour along
Yeah
I suppose it'll cost
yeah
Cost more in printing cost more doesn't it?
Yeah
Yeah an awful lot more
Yeah, yeah so if 
I mean it is a quite complex problem because once you've 
Once you have a single colour it's okay 
Yeah
Yeah a single colour, ah, right, yes, well that maybe quite nice
Because you want something which is big and small
Mhm
so that you know you can use it, you know, on your own, publicity material 
Yes something that'll look good blown up aha 
Yes, yes 
to do a poster or something
yes, that's
That doesn't immediately occur to me that it's for blind people
No
No
That's what I thought
it's like for like, for, for like hearing, a hearing aid person
Mm
that's my initial thought it's not obvious 
Oh we definitely don't want that cos all the money will go 
 
the money will go to sign language in Devon
Can I, can I have a  
What you see are the headphones so you think about hearing 
Hearing 
you don't think about sight
That's right, yes
and I think that's, that's quite, quite right 
Yes I mean just, I mean this is, you know
Mhm
this is the quick
we did for this, and that's
Yeah
why we just put the eyes on the front
Mhm
what we don't want is a
man with a white stick job
No, no
I mean that's
no, no and we don't, we don't want a green dog either no
And a dog oh no watch Graham
I think that
yes
A bit His Master's Voice isn't it?
Yes 
Oh no, a guide dog listening
His Master's Voice in Hamlet, you know, it's just, stick a who I am on that wee dog, I can remember I can see, I can remember that from 
But the, the dog listening to a big ear instead of a, an earphone 
If guide dogs can sue us
Aye guide dogs, I know.
Now er moving on
erm I did phone Marcus  up and asked why were the
coming to London and it is something to do with television
Yes
he gave me a number to phone and I've tried phoning and I've not had a response, but I'll keep trying 
This is a 
that's very difficult to get hold of
Yeah I haven't managed to get all of them 
Yes, mhm 
Sixteenth of September, no
The nineteenth
Nineteenth
round about then, mhm
Right, cos it only dawned on me cos the first of September 
erm the Wakefield meeting that was talked about
Right
on the nineteenth of August was postponed and it's now in a couple of weeks, so I'm gonna go
Is it now?
Right
in a couple of weeks, whenever it is
Right
Same one I was going to go down to
Was that, what was it on?
Glad I didn't go down to it 
It was about training
Oh it's about training
I thought that was something else you were going to go to
Yes
Glad you didn't go eh?
Yes I did, yes 
Well just as well I'd , that sounds good
Yeah, Marcus was being quite sort of vague, but Marcus is gonna be here at the end of the month
Yeah
Yes, by the way I'm gonna be able to see Max , I'll tell you that now because I've been dragged off to another conference, I'm actually going down to the, to the rehabilitation workers' phones 
You haven't been dragged off at all 
I'm furious
and Alan's started phoning me up and saying 
And then you're flying up to Stone Haven
sorting out and then I've got to go down to that conference and fly up to Stone Haven
Yeah 
that's two 
however it doesn't matter
And when are you going to get to Stone Haven?
I don't know 
I don't think there's an airport in Stone Haven
No
Oh
You're flying into
what?
She's actually flying to Di's
Just drop you off in
I'm not coming
You can see it all folks
That's for the thirtieth you're flying into Dave's?
Aha
Well I'll be in Aberdeen
Anyway
Oh
and that's Aberdeen airport  I could maybe pick you up 
Yes, let's try and 
I'm not quite sure I've put my name down 
cos I live in Aberdeen, my home's Aberdeen, so I'll be in Aberdeen 
for that with the thing with the fancy 
Excellent I'll get together with that
quite right, I can easily be at Dave's Saturday, no problem, I know Dave
That's a Saturday is it?
That's a Saturday
Yes
What's the 
I don't know 
I know 
I quite like to go, but erm
Well I'll be in 
I was telling you  
I'd loved to have gone you know
Commodore cos that's where Tom's going
commercial in Russell Square, next door
Aye next door
 
Oh that  
Yeah 
all the theatres and the country
There is the, there's the  
 
I find that quite useful
The erm Scottish Theatre Guide
Yes the Scottish Theatre Guide
I haven't seen one of them for a long time
I'm staying in Aberdeen
Of course 
That was Scottish, Federation Scottish
There's a theatre marketing which is closing it, well, sort of shutting up shop at the end of the month, maybe  
So do I, what I like about going home is you can get away  
I haven't seen that for a long time
So we're back
this isn't a Federation
That's right
Marketing Committee
that's right, but if you're actually going home it's easy
Cos I seem to remember having so something a long time ago, especially the smaller theatres as well as a touring thing, you know, it'll be handy for you
Yeah
Mm
you know what was going to be where
Yeah I think though, I mean it comes back to sort of wanting to know, we're just talking again about what's on
Mm
Mhm
we need to know before it's published
That's right 
you know you need to know like six months before
I, I won't give up
And if everybody does 
all sorts of 
for finding that out, whether you go through the Arts Council
Yeah
you see the Arts Council has a finger in most pies, the only way to find out through them, I mean the trouble is, a lot of it, is going to be confidential
Mm
Yes
erm
But then if you did it at the stage before, before it gets into the Scottish Theatre Guide you can then make your dates available or you can agree your dates and you can get publicity and that at home.
Yes, cos that's the thing
That's the thing
aha
Publicity is the thing 
So we need to find
Aha
But if, if you can find out through Lucy whether or not 
Mm 
that publication is still on the go, because if it is gonna carry on, on the go, we can maybe get into the
Yeah
editorial of, of the gathering of the information
Mhm
Yes 
That would be 
Yeah, right  erm
cos the publicity is not just for visually impaired people or even for sponsors, it's for theatres too when they're seeing this and saying ooh, I noticed they're doing that, this, this and this
Mm
and we're not doing it
Yes
you see and that would be 
Yes that's right 
that'll be an idea wouldn't it?
Talking about publications , one of the things from the last meeting is Iris pointed out the number of theatres in here say they do audio description and I've, I've
yeah
Oh I, I said that to you at the time Robert, I mean I'll be honest and I saw that document and I nearly died and it's the way they say it too 
I don't suppose  
you know
I've been, I've been through them all and er there's only one or two that I've not actually had any contact with actually one way or another.
Some of them are people that erm  that I've generally had contact with, in terms of starting to talk to people about it erm, other people are being kind of, what's the word, optimistic, with the truth Likes And The Brides for example , erm
Well we have done it
We've done it since they lied about what happens 
It's like it's like the Arkley one, I want to know, you know and the small and the one Down In The Borders
The one that's Down In The Borders yes, I mean that, I've seen so , another piece of print about that one Down In The Borders and erm  it's, it's not our version of audio description, so I am going to write
and linked to that I was going to do a new information sheet, I found the old information sheet so I just bring that up to date 
Mhm
I do, I like, do you think I could have a copy of anything you've got to date because lying in my desk this morning is something I have to prepare a briefing note for my chairman and I was thinking about that recent one, but I couldn't put my hand on it Robert, absolutely updated on exactly where we are.
I don't think I've got one here, but I could send you one.
Could, could you, thanks, thanks Robert, could you fax it?
Yeah
Cos he wants it like
Yesterday
What does he want it for?
Oh, well, because this video has come in
Of course 
it's gone, it's gone to chief execs
Oh I see so they want 
in the Regional Council and they now want to know all about them see 
the back ground, yeah 
so that's good, because it might mean money, it means of having 
and that's for Counsellor ?
Well no it's the convener, the convener of the whole region
Oh right
like you know
Yeah, whatever it is
No, ah, more senior than him, it'll go to him too, but it'll be for everybody's
So what you want then is the sheet we did a few weeks ago just about the erm 
Yeah, give me the update, yes and if you're just updating that a bit, if you're gonna update it then, aha
Right, okay
yeah
Cos it'd be nice to show it's happening here, here, here and there, you know.
Yeah I'm not sure if it mentions the magic words
Regional Council, but
Well you'll have to get that fitted in somehow I'll, I'll fit it 
if, if, if not 
 
you can re-type it if you can
gonna get
It's on the computer though, I think we can manage
Oh dear
So erm, Advisory Committee being the next item, well we will, we'll have a word from Brian we'll, I haven't approached er David  yet in Glasgow meeting, but I will do
Mhm
and obviously Ingy will let us know when she can come and we can talk a little more about the Festival.
Erm, I've been thinking that I can't chair this meeting and take the notes and things  when it becomes, and if it, the fund comes through and it becomes the audio description project as opposed to this group, and you know we will be widening out a little bit, I wonder if we should actually have a chairman type person.
I haven't spoken to erm, I mean I only thought this coming along in the street, whether there's anybody sort of notable, I mean is it, is, is, is there any value in actually having a figurehead type chairman you know, sort of celebrity type 
Yes I think it makes a big difference 
type person who you can 
Oh yeah somebody could 
push forward to
Mhm
you know snip ribbons and things I dunno, I'm not suggesting will you find out now, but there's something
yes, interesting angle 
If there's anybody that comes to mind.
I thought about Tom  on more than one occasion because Tom  for so many years was the voice of the royal wedding and erm this and that state affairs and things, state occasions and he only lives in Murrayfield, I mean
A state of affairs is not appropriate at the moment mind you  
I heard that 
They were, they were videoing for this
thing and you know, they were over and some of them were doing something and it is somebody you normally and the news and I said the news and actually sort of frozen and the guy said to me, he must of actually seen me frozen there, he said it's okay, it's okay, it's nothing about whatever her name is, you know 
I said oh no, no, he said I've to go to Brussels you know and it'll be all about, oh I thought I was really dreading it
I, I don't know, I, I think it'll be lovely if you can get up a blind person
Mm
Yes
Mm
blind actress, a well known blind
is it that?
Was a blind actor
he's, dead now I think
Oh is she dead?
We don't want
He is
Oh we don't 
no she wouldn't she's away, yes, she was away
Anyway that's what's involved 
Anyway it's a thought 
Yes it's a new thought, mhm
Yes
I mean there's, there's the practical side of actually having, I mean well there's various aspects of it you could have someone as a figurehead
Mhm
who never actually did anything apart from this, sort of push forward to receive cheques from
The only thing is to make sure that somebody's going to come along, because the worst possible scenario is like 
or you could have, or you have 
the Society for the Blind in Glasgow who the lord lady profe 
Oh who never turns up for anything 
professed person and they, she, she never turned up at anything
Not even the opening?
She never ever turned up at anything
Never, so I mean you might as well not bother you know
Mhm
or whether you actually have 
In fact it makes you more stupid 
Mm
you know working type chairman or something, I don't know, anyway it's just for you to think about it
Yes, that's it
Right, any other business Iris  look forward to the Playback send you about seven hundred pounds
Mhm
and so Jane  can now report the, now that's been settled 
Yes, thank you, thank you 
That's really good
Erm
but er
I thought I was a
yesterday, erm
Aha
something although they were quite, er nothing, nothing to do with er
Aha
and to pop down to do theatre because I see Paula eat before at Perth
Aha
and he assured me it is an 
Who's this?
ideal little spot to do it audio description from
The commentary booth, yeah
Yeah
because when Marcus and I went we didn't actually see up there, but we could see from down there and 
Yes, yes that's 
yeah
aha
I think we'll be okay on that
Mhm
Paul of course is leaving
Oh
Is he?
Ah
to go and do something in Dundee, so they've advertised his job
Oh 
Oh well we were talking about funding, I've actually got an account for expenses
Oh right
so that's what the money is about and that's where the money came from
Mhm
Aha
I've got I, we're, we're going to get some money from the Ingy fund for the Festival
Mm
Yes
plus, erm, plus the expenses from us going from Glasgow, I don't know whether anybody from Edinburgh will have expenses, but erm, what shall, where, where shall I ask her to send this cheque for it, I mean I still, there's still an account open for it in Glasgow for audio description
Aha
Right
but I mean who was, Linda would, would be treasurer
Yeah
has she got an account there?
Yes
It'll probably be better just to get and then she'll the money for the
Yes that's right
so I'll get them to send it off to Linda 
if we, all the information for Linda comes through me anyway
Yes, right, okay, fine
because the address she's put it on is the society's address
Oh is it?
Yes
Right
which she felt was better than her home address
Aha 
Oh yes aha
right
and I've got the bank book
Fine
so the money is
I see
I'll get the cheque made payable to and 
Hope you're administering this Robert 
and then
Robert knows 
The only question is whether or not Jane has a key to open the drawer in the  
I know I couldn't get the, I couldn't find the key for the desk, no 
That was her story, alright
Oh I've forgot to say under advisory committee, I, this has taken so long, I've completely forgot about it.
We do  when we set up this group we asked
for a representative
Ah, yes aha
and eventually after some searching they nominated someone who then  resigned from her post not Clare  
Clearly because they nominated for  
Right 
in Stirling, central region, erm changed her job or something so that she no longer her, her voice
Mhm
on disability issues and they haven't been able to find anybody else, but what they've said,despite extensive attempts the convention has not been able to obtain a replacement for this one, due to and buys us time.
I'm disappointed that we cannot be represented, but sure you will appreciate position.
Please continue to send papers for any relevant meetings and an attempt will be made to respond to appropriate issues, if there is any specific topic you wish to be considered, please do not hesitate to get in touch  so I thought that was quite a nice letter seeing as I practically read them all
I would also like a copy of that
Mhm
because if I enclosed a copy of that with this response to chief execs
Mhm
that'll kind of filter its way through into and will cause will certain need some  
Yes I'm not quite sure of how
and they won't like that one little bit, they'll amend them because they've done it
Yeah, I mean it's been going on for ages
I don't think that's
erm 
particularly fair
right, I mean I'm not quite sure how Coslow will go about things, I mean the reason we wanted someone from Coslow is cos we wanted someone from the Federation of Scottish Theatre cos we hadn't heard for a while
Yes
we had Roy  and then we had Simon for a bit and then we decided because it wasn't working altogether an Edinburgh person and a Glasgow person
Mhm
erm
Well I think it's very important Robert because, I mean as the charter for the arts indicated look at the money that local authorities are spending upstairs to us and really you know we, we are  
Well exactly, I mean we have, we sort of, we, we kind of anticipated that 
Oh yes, so I mean come on let's, let's give them another wee push, gently 
so , I mean we've erm, I mean I've developed a relationship with David  at Coslow
Yes that's right
so it might be that  he could come, erm, anyway I'll give you a copy of that
Yes, so that I can just sort of say, you know, we did invite and, that might help
Where are we on 
I mean I'm not quite sure how Coslow , how do Coslow sort of nominate their representatives like that?
We asked them to put some
I've no idea, I mean, did they sort of send someone like you
who's  who is an employee 
Well for, for example Phil  is our, yeah Phil  seems to, to go to some of these meetings and, but mainly it's the elected members
Yeah
Mhm
and it's usually elected in 
Well Glen  isn't in fact an elected member
Ah, right, well, I mean she should be able to give us somebody, God there's, there's ten million of them 
I would of thought so that's right
And it helps you 
Cos I was looking at 
with funding, you know, it does help
What about Jimmy ?
because then they go back Jimmy ?
Yeah
Councillor  you know people like that 
Yeah anyway
Yes that would be
where are we with costing and theatres on the nominal charge?
What are we doing about that?
Er, I haven't contacted the Citizens in due course, but erm
Yeah
that was a
you have contacted the Lyceum
Have I contacted the Lyceum?
Oh good we're charging the Lyceum
Yes
Erm
because we agreed to it 
What was it we said?
Twenty pounds
I was gonna
What I just want to 
I was gonna say fifteen 
To you fifteen
Everybody say a different figure now
 

I, I have talked 
Are we to invoice 
Brampton Theatre asked me how much it was going to cost, so I, off the top of my head I said twenty pounds
Mm
erm thinking that we ought to charge something because to hire the equipment is very expensive
Sure
and if we were looking at running costs and replacing things and 
 
and all the rest of it 
that's what I'd say, yes, yes 
of course 
to be, to be replacing that, so I said twenty pounds off the top of my head, so Brampton Theatre have agreed to that as well 
Right
and they will
will they pay that as a one er
Yeah, mhm they'll pay
Pay each time
Yeah, yeah
Will you require 
Is that either side each time or is that up until Christmas?
Right, presumably if there was a necessity, would there be a necessity to produce an invoice?
I mean what would your system
Mm, yes 
require an invoice for that kind of thing?
Yeah
Oh yes
Well what we might have to do is concoct something up on a letter, a stand have you a standard charge?
but it doesn't matter whether it was, you don't have to do one 
You'd do it all
You could do in advance or you could do retrospectively or 
Do it as that or you can do it after three months, yes I mean
We could do it up till Christmas, three monthly or something like that
Yeah
Mind, we wouldn't want it every time
Yes, mm
So we need to some time  
Too much paper work apart from anything else
Yes, that's right it's a pest 
That's good that's good
Yeah
it just gets a wee bit much
Mm, well it, it keeps you being able to run it so you're 
Mm 
not stuck
Yes and
That's a hundred and eighty pounds worth there
Yeah
It's too  
It's too expensive over, over the holiday season
That's right
That's another one for Christmas then 
double 
It's certainly cheaper than the way you were doing it 
It's certainly cheaper than three hundred and fifty quid, they showed up
that's it exactly and that's crazy
Right I don't think I've got any other things
You could of bought your own equipment
Yeah
by now 
Yes you could of
it's a shame
 

Erm, oh I have got something else, which is music, erm, at the last meeting I said I've been talking to Simon  from the Queen's Hall, about the idea of doing pre-concert notes
Mhm
Right
not, not actually doing an audio description of the conductor
 

and again, and again
Worried about doing ballet 
One thing, one thing about it, it's crossed my mind a long time ago is er the idea of erm in the half hour or whatever twenty minutes before a concert, doing er concert programme notes
Yeah
particularly if there's you know heavy
Mm
information about a particular piece, so, Simon and I sort of, we were talking kind of fairly casually about that, but erm, what we agreed to do is, this was about the time when we first got the equipment I think and it, it occurred to me that you, and I've checked this now, that you can actually plug a cassette, you know, a Walkman type of player into either the microphone for the 
Right 
radio system or
Aha
indeed into the infra red if you were using the, I mean obviously that's a small scale, probably wouldn't, erm, so the idea of actually putting some concert notes onto a tape or indeed doing it live, so anyway Simon is away on holiday, after the Festival but I've arranged Cannon principal and for him and you
Right
and his most regular blind patron who you know Mrs  
Mhm 
to
Ann  mhm
to kind of just get together with someone he's identified a person whose name I can't remember but he's got a chamber orchestra
Right
what I was interested in knowing in was for example whether he's got his chamber orchestra repeated their same concert five or six times in different cities
Mm
I just, it's just a sort of an idea at this stage, I'm not wanting to take up ogres of time on this, but 
I'm quite weary of doing it with a, with a full set and everything it's, it's, it's, awfully tiring for taking the system
Yeah
down and, and may well be just one person requiring and you've got somebody else to go down 
Yeah, well there may be other mechanisms of doing it 
with it and hand it out week and then at the concert collect it at the end again
Yeah
it's a kind of thing that I think could be put and take and people could pick up at the box office 
Yeah I think so 
Yeah, well maybe that's what we, we
You could pick it up beforehand at the box office 
Well maybe that's what you do, yeah 
Er, yes
Erm, you know, maybe it's something we can do in just a one off during the winter
Mhm
you know if the SEL are doing concerts on the basis of six or seven of the same, I'm, I, I really don't know enough about it
Mhm
and it maybe something that we can get one person to come into Playback
Yeah
make up a, a note and then you 
How did the home of the brave do their thing?
That was to do with head sets?
Eh, to do with head sets yes
Aha, nothing to do with
And that was picked up 
Our infra reds there
They're infra red, yeah
That's picked up right then
So, so there is something  
I mean Margaret, have you been to it Cath?
No
Margaret  was at it really she said really it was not much for blind people 
No and I've 
No it's not 
I've spoke to Colin to
just to try and cope with it
And the crowds
and the aha
Yes, aha
very difficult for blind people
Mhm
No we were not 
There was lots of 
consulted or asked or involved or anything like that 
there's lots of things you could touch 
Yes though, yes
which is good
which is good, makes a change, aha
So that's the only other sort of bit of sort of
The other thing is I mean, erm, the, the Trone did it a couple of years ago, they haven't done it this year they 
Er, no, yes 
recorded they got, somebody recorded
that's right
the, the entire winter programme
the next three months of programme on tape, several plays there were 
Not that you did, erm 
and I think there was a bit of a up the place
Aha 
and they had they, we copied them
That's right
and we had half a dozen of them at the box office and if anyone, I think we still sent them out if anyone wanted them
Yes
but it meant people could go up to the box office and take a tape recorder and sit and listen to them
Right
I think they had to take the  
Oh we did that as well, you had the 
Morag does it, Morag does it for them anyway
Yes, so it's quite good to have that kind of thing to publicize.
Yes it would be good to get the Trone to do that again, we must have
again
Yes
cos that stopped
Yes
I mean he was doing that before we ever started audio description and now
 
They've been doing it for some time at the Biro, Perth is
Oh yes does, does the Biro 
At St Andrew's 
do the Biro not do it using actors now then as well?
Yes they do 
they actually use the actors who are going to be there because it's easier
This wasn't, this was just a programme
Yes
cos Alan says he gets copies of that from the Biro Theatre 
Yes that's right 
I mean it's a jolly good idea it really is
So there are a few initiatives there, but I don't think there's been done anything on the music front though.
We do yours from the information that goes out
Mhm
Morag records it in newspaper
Mhm
so it's on our tapes anyway
Right
so it could go on a separate tape if you wanted that to happen, it's on a Mazda tape
Mm
so it could go on
tapes, we could do it
Right
It's easy for you to have it at the theatre, mhm
to take a copy from that
Yeah
Yeah
Could easily do that
I perhaps could
easily do that
they could pick from me up here or, even send it out
yeah could even have some at the theatre and
Yes
Morag does it anyway
Mhm
so there's no point in duplicating it
No
so in a way that's not really audio description, although it's
No
obviously
No
closely linked, but it's not really
But it's always a, a joy for blind people to go to the theatre
Yeah
Mhm
if they're involved, yes
that's right 
Right, I've nothing else, has anybody else have any other topics?
Ah, good
erm
That's rather nice, ah nice
It is, it's nice most of them don't work, I've got 
Date of next meeting?
a lovely one over there 
Oh
Yes I've been looking at that and thinking we'll take it, mm 
Its great isn't it?
Probably worth a fortune I find 
Present it to us yes and doesn't work
Oh and doesn't work, well
Maybe because it's not wound up
Is the mouse dead?
the time of day and er
Yeah
you're quite right, yes 
Can I ask just a little, it's quite a big question actually, I don't know if anybody will answer it.
Is there any research
Probably not
on the size or the whereabouts of the potential markets that we have as a theatre?
Well this is something that we have talked about 
I mean we touched on how we're going to reach some, but is there any 
this is something we've, we've talked about and in fact Lucy and I have talked about it
Mhm
actually we, mm, at some length and had a few ideas, erm I've got an appointment with someone at the Arts Council in a couple of weeks that the Arts Council's got a new fund called erm  consultants in research and I thought I'd make a bid to see if we can get someone
Mhm
to research this audience and ways of getting to it
Mhm
Mhm
Presumably you know roughly how many people are, are already 
If you look at the number on the register, I've got three and a half thousand 
Already we can give you these numbers I mean we've got  
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything if you're getting ten people turning up
It doesn't mean anything
No, but it means, it means that we know how we've got to gear up
Yes 
Yes to a lot of things
I think what we needs is a
What we're ready to pitch that sort of thing
That's right, I think what means something is this overall figure and then erm a kind of er an information giving part which points out that what, you know, what seventy five per cent of my twelve thousand had over sixty five
Mm
fifty per cent over seventy five
Mhm
but a piece of research would be very good because that would help in honesty when you're trying to get erm organized with er transport and things
Yeah
That's why we're saying transport important because the majority of people are over seventy five
Sure, but it also goes down to do with erm, matinee and doing the evening performance
But what, that's right 
Yes, what should, aha 
and there's also
that's right and there's also people who have been to the theatre before that's not an audience who have 
Yes, no, oh no 
And the audience, yeah
and it's not like the deaf audience had, had dealing with the
have a hearing audience, yes that are older, but the deaf audience which is very young, but other audiences and  people who have lost their sight
Yes
have been to theatre
Mhm
and who really, could, yeah 
Who have once enjoyed the theatre , yes
The sort of thing is
it's bringing them back
Yeah, the sort of thing Lucy and I were talking about earlier is, it was just before I went on holiday so my memory is kind of hazy, it's one where I was going to see the Arts Council and see if they were interested in the idea if they work
Mhm
you know this is the initial chat if they're interested, you know, you suddenly put paper and go back to Lucy and say okay, let's write this down 
Right, right 
but I mean it was things like doing questionnaires maybe telephone question phoning people up you know that your three and a half, well not all of them but an example
Mhm
and she seemed fairly confident about her questionnaire in developing the right question in questionnaire, but I suppose that would be in conjunction with people like you
Mm
Yes
Mhm
erm to, to sort of engage a response.
It was, it was as much to do with what kind of things would you like to see
Mhm
listen to
Yes, cos that's the other bit isn't it?
Aha 
as, as, it's the choice aspect of it as well as the sort of, if there was an audio description would you go and you know
Mhm
what kind of things do you want to have audio described, so there are, I mean there's still quite a bit, but she got quite excited about the idea of involving one of the proper, well not proper, one of the, you know, official professional market research firms, as well in terms of doing this work, maybe, maybe getting money from the Arts Council to actually pay them
Mhm
to do it, although, whether they have this appropriate kind of sensitivity of not I don't know
No, mhm
so it, it is a sort of it's a kind of sort of liveish topic it's sort of in one of those stages where it's not actually happening yet because a
But I mean erm, I mean it it's blatantly obviously at this 
I think there's a, there's 
point your thinking how can we get people involved.
How can we get the people, yeah.
I mean I worked at, as an open afternoon or something where we invite like into the theatre
Yes
find out what, feel around the theatre,
Yes
get onto the stage, feel a set, talk to some of the actors 
Talk to the costume people 
talk to the costume people you know, talk about make up because a lot of 
Yes, cos remember at the beginning of all this audio description lots a chat about including all that
That's right
I was horrified because you know it's like bringing blind people in, doing all this, but something like that, open day, whatever, that'll be wonderful 
That would 
that'll be great fun
Yeah 
would encourage people to
Mhm
That's right, if you're organizing something like that and thinking about it from now, this is only the first of September, but
Yes
Newspeak's already out
Yes
That's right
so the only, the  that the easiest way for me to do 
Playback's out yeah 
Playback's out as well, the easiest way for us to get to people is through these
Mhm
tapes 
Tapes 
now the next one doesn't go out until October so you would have to have something in November
Mhm
to give people time to organize it 
I think yeah two, two months ahead 
That would be okay, I mean 
to let you mention it once 
two months ahead 
let you mention it again
at least two months ahead 
and go on about it again 
so if you had a date in November that you could give me, time to get people together
Mhm
I have a huge group of people who meet the first Thursday in every month
Aha
so even to get them there
Yes
That would help a lot
would be a good er
Yes getting them in the door is the
get them in the door
The blind people respond really 
wanted to come back, yeah 
well to somewhere they've been
Yeah
That's right
and if they've been there, people have been really nice to them
Mhm
and it's been good fun, they do want to come back
I have thirty or forty people who meet once a month for
Oh that's excellent
first Thursday in the month
Aha
and we could get them to you
Mhm
cos their meeting could just be with you
Mhm
Yes good idea
for that afternoon
That'll be ideal, yes
That'll be ideal
Mm, yeah
I think that's a wonderful idea
Yes
easily organized
Mhm
If they could see the theatre to see what was going on and an example of audio description
Get them into the theatre without a lot of sighted people to push through that's what it's like, yes 
Yes, that's right, yes 
Yes
and find out where the, the la ladies is
Where the loo, it's as simple as that, yes
all that kind of thing, yes
Yeah
It's having that knowledge you know
That's right trying to get people together for that Japanese 
Let them take  
night
I remember Japanese night
but that was very difficult to organize because they, they never give us time and, and 
That's right, yeah 
if you don't have two months, you can't do it
No you can't, you really have time
you've got to have two months, mm
So your publ your publishing date for this is October?
First of October it'll go out
First of October
Mhm and Iris
Probably round about then
and then you'll need that
