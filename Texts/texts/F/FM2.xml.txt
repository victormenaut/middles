Excellent.
Right.
Presents.
Erm  presents.
Present one is for Derek.
Erm
Whee!
you have to fill in the rest of that and give it back to me.
Erm 
Erm sure, no problem.
I've no idea whether you made a note of your mileages to Leeds and back, but please make something up .
No, but I know how many miles I know how many miles it is to Leeds and back .
Right.
That's not a problem.
Well please make something up and fill it in.
Erm  and er I'll take that away 
Okay.
with me today.
Okay, I shall fill 
Erm 
that in now.
and then you'll see it again when I finally pay you.
.
.
But not before!
And I 
Right.
won't be paying you until I've got some money,
Well,
I'm afraid.
Leeds is  Well it's actually not Leeds it's  Garforth  and then it's Leeds and it's back .
.
Erm
I don't know.
That's twenty five.
Fifty.
Call it fifty miles.
Whatever.
Write down some appropriate mileages and that's  super.
Erm  my next prezzie is sort of more of the same actually.
I've got some expenses claim forms cos I thought it would be a good idea to be able to claim expenses,
Yep.
on a form 
.
you know.
Well, whatever.
Erm we nearly knocked over Simon   on our way here.
I was driving along t you know t telling David that all the time  that that people are on the roads practising how to drive and becoming better drivers there are people like that wally there crossing the roa Oh, it's Simon .
.
Oops.
Excellent.
I'll tell him about that later.
I should have just put my foot down and knocked him over.
.
It'd've served him right for being such a spaced-out hippy.
Yes.
But erm  there you go.
Do you want to grab a couple of those 
Okay.
and then then  those are for the Derek and Clare symbiote.
Right.
Erm 
Thank you.
Erm  new version of the Spoken Cor Corpus Consent Form that has a little space for tape numbers.
It's not desperately important but 
What's a reasonable amount to claim per mile by the way?
Christ knows.
I've got to phone the Inland Revenue tomorrow and ask them what the maximum 
Yeah.
that they'll allow us to claim.
They have set amounts.
Oh,
Right.
what's what er C C's your car?
Er thirteen hundred.
Thirteen hundred.
Righty ho.
Cos it I gather there's sort of two or 
Yes.
three bands.
There must be.
Makes sense.
Okay.
So actually could you make a note on there somewhere, erm sort of underneath the  at per mile  or something  that's it's er  .
It's very exciting, I can fill one of these in.
Excellent.
Whee!
I hope you have the receipt.
I do have the receipt, yes.
Otherwise, as it says 
.
on the top,
Remember to attach all receipts and note all mileages.
This claim will not be paid in the absence of the relevant documentation .
That do?
So there!
Yes.
Brilliant.
.
Clapped out V W Jetta.
I don't think they care how clapped out it is actually.
Erm  David, have some of those.
It's not clapped out.
It's lovely.
It's done  one thousand miles .
You guys can have  those.
Thank you .
Right.
Thank you .
Ooh excellent.
some real paper.
Erm  and then we can have one of these each.
Ooh.
Which are  erm  This is actually me being bored this afternoon.
.
It might be an idea to just make a note of 
Jeez.
what the counties are that we're covering,
Yeah.
and  about how many words we want from each one.
It basically winds down to about ninety thousand words from each county.
.
Erm 
Mm.
but I haven't, because they haven't, broken down Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales into separate counties.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Erm  if you add all that up it comes to about three million words.
Great.
Three million?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Which is probably the most realistic estimate of what we're collecting.
Okay.
Erm although we may be collecting more than that, and we may be collecting less than that.
I think three million is a fairly reasonable amount
Mm.
to assume.
Erm 
Right.
don't want to be sort of too  enthusiastic about the number of words, just in case it turns out that they can't  .
Oh erm   Not Tyneside or Northumberland except for businesses ?
Yeah.
Ah.
Right.
That's because Maureen erm
Yeah.
has collected in those areas fairly extensively.
Right.
Er what you had down 
And is going to carry on collecting in those areas .
What you had down on the previous one was er  schools and  businesse Schools, businesses and something else, I think, that she'd collected 
No.
from.
She she's collected 
Certainly schools and 
from schools, erm the university,
Right.
Erm I mean sh she ended up her description of 
Mm.
what she'd collected by saying that she hasn't really gone to any 
It's just that  
businesses, so
er 
.
I was thinking of asking Monica if she could record something from the the Model Car Club and 
Yeah.
their club meetings.
Oh that'd be okay I think.
Is that  Monica?
Yes.
Erm she's alread already asked her Dad but 
Right.
but they don't have  meetings.
They they Meetings take
.
place during the evening er as very sort of at the  
Right.
Okay.
it wouldn't work.
And we've 
Right.
missed the A G M.
Okay.
It was earlier this year.
Fair enough..
Erm anyway I mean that's just a guideline  really.
Erm  I'm going to or I've I've started every time a recording comes in making a note of where it's from and what type of recording it is,
Yeah.
and once I've got 
Okay.
I've got the word count from each one I'll be able to sort of tot up and tell you when to stop collecting from that area.
Well we're gonna have North Yorkshire sewn up pretty soon.
We are.
Erm which is good.
Mm.
Erm 
Then we can start with  the rest of Yorkshire .
I l I gave Eddie a load of the bumph 
Excellent.
and told him to go away with it and think about what he could do, and er mentioned money to him, and he liked the idea.
.
Erm 
Yes.
Eddie has a er a very large bank balance but unfortunately it's not his money .
Not his..
.
Erm 
Yes, and it's guaranteed by his parents isn't it?
Mhm.
Yeah.
So er Eddie has a vested interest in getting some money from somewhere.
Yes.
Erm 
candidate.
The map that's in the back of what they gave us  looks as though it might  blown up  .
I've given up on that idea actually.
Erm I think writing it down's probably  just as reasonable .
Oh no.
I mean it doesn't actually 
oh!
need to be very big,we just need some coloured pins .
.
Oh my pen's gone walkies.
Bugger .
Here, borrow that.
I want my pen.
There it is, I've found it.
Okay.
Erm 
No pleasing some people is there .
Well I No I thought I'd better find it cos otherwise I'd walk off without it and then you'd get my pen, and I
.
bought this as a company pen.
Oh right.
I've got a receipt and everything .
This is a company Bic!.
.
It's true!
Well we'd return it to the company then wouldn't we?
Mm.
It just might be  a bit short of ink when we do .
Yes.
.
Well the ink belongs to the company too.
Well we'll use it  on company business .
.
Erm where were we?
I've completely lost track now, and it's all 
Right.
your fault.
I'm sorry.
So you've given a breakdown of th roughly how much 
Yes.
word count we need from each area.
Yeah.
I mean it it's 
Which is very helpful 
It it goes further south than I thought it did.
Yeah.
Erm  the the 
Er cos I I wouldn't have in I When I was making the the analysis I w wasn't including Hereford and Worcester and I wasn't 
Mm.
including Warwickshire.
Well what they've done basically is they've drawn erm  This list contains all the counties bar erm the sort of Tyneside area
Mm.
in their supra-regions erm North 
Right.
and Midland.
Mm.
Yeah.
And the Midland actually goes down to sort of the top of  erm Cambridgeshire,
Oh right.
and then slightly south 
Right.
and west of there,
Right.
Okay.
down to the south the south tip of Wales pretty much.
I mean it's two thirds of the country.
Yeah.
Hereford.
It's not two thirds of the population but it's two thirds of the  .
Richard .
Richard's in Hereford.
Yes.
Warwickshire.
Isn't Sam in Warwickshire?
Er Sam is in Warwickshire, yes.
Yes.
I'm going to get an address for Sam anyway cos I I want to get in touch with him 
Yes.
about GOD.
Yes.
Is the Captain still there, or is he somewhere else?
.
The Captain is in Coventry.
Right.
Er  
I have to ask,now that you've said that 
.
It's a i it's a game design project.
Okay.
It stands for Gamer's Own Design.
Fine.
It's creating a game background in six days .
Six days.
Yes.
Okay.
.
.
What do you do on the seventh day?
Rest.
Rest..
Not game frantically?
No.
No.
No, no.
It was suggested that everybody relax a lot.
After staying awake for a hundred and forty four hours .
Yeah.
.
In whatever way they felt appropriate.
Yes.
And I'm not going to expand on that cos the  tape's running .
.
Good good.
Good good.
Actually erm  erm  just to butt in t here  .
.
Who was it?
Aaron I think was saying yesterday that it would be a good idea to get at least one tape of some erm stoned people.
Right.
Because people use
.
language differently when they're
Mm.
under the affluence.
Affluence.
.
Indeed.
It it's very true .
Well we know who to talk to don't we?
Yes.
.
We'll get you a 
What?
a tape of somebody under the affluence.
That's the one, yes..
.
After having hear his discourse on  the wonders of interchangeable brain chips and the lunar landscape just above the ceiling border in thirty  Road, I think he would probably be  quite a good candidate.
.
You'll ask him then?
.
Yes.
Yeah.
I
Right.
I had other people in mind as well actually.
But er 
Well I I mean I was thinking you know er it's probably a good idea for for erm Well I've heard it proposed by people who do these things
.
that it's a good idea for when people are intending to get stoned in a heavy way to have a baby-sitter, so there's no reason why the baby- sitter couldn't sit there  with a tape recorder .
.
It's true.
Yes.
Nobody else in the room is going to stop them.
Yeah.
But the erm the best thing would then be for the when the these people came round again to listen to the tape,
.
and have power of veto over it.
As always.
Oh yes.
Yeah, I think they'd probably have to listen 
Ah.
Yes it's a point.
to what they've said because 
Point, they can't be under the affluence when they sign the consent form or  .
Mm.
.
Yeah.
Erm 
No, no, no, you are not Captain James T Kirk of the Starship Enterprise..
.
Does he do that too?
I don't think he does but I can think of people who would.
.
Erm  well, I mean that that would be  be erm 
Yeah.
The other thing my father said when I was 
interesting for want of a 
speaking to him was that erm the place he where he's recording in Scotland erm  tends to have an unusual vocabulary.
Yeah.
Occasionally swear words are interspersed with functional words like it's and mine but i it tends to be  very heavily orientated towards the the less  nice side of the language up there.
That's alright.
So I said to him it was fine,
Yeah.
because you know the kind of material we're recording bad language isn't gonna get an appropriate representation, and he's not to worry about it on that 
Yeah.
account.
But I mean that's entirely reasonable .
Mm.
Mm.
Erm as long as we don't mind transcribing them, and I for one don't.
No.
I mean I have met people who really objected strongly to transcribing swearing.
Erm  
It wouldn't worry me.
But  I don't 
.
Well, yeah.
Well we're all young enough not to be bothered by it.
Yes.
I mean it's the obviously it's the 
That's true.
older generation that were brought up in under different whatevers,
Mm.
mores or whatever, that that would object to it.
And since I swear like a Navvy anyway,
.
it would be hypocritical to object really.
. Erm  erm erm erm.
Well I've sort of got a note to say who did what this week, so I could tell you what I've done this week and then you could tell me what you've done this week.
That would be good .
Then everybody will know.
Yeah.
Erm  I've got lots of people collecting tapes on my behalf.
The the careers service came up with two tapes which was nice.
Mike came up with a tape, which was nice.
Erm  he claims the battery ran out before he got to his  presentation on the course but I don't necessarily believe him.
The battery was flat but I don't think it was a tape and half flat.
I think it was
.
This has been switched on all afternoon and left flat.
Erm 
Mm.
But.
My Dad in Nottinghamshire has Nottinghamshire fairly sewn up.
Which is nice .
That's good.
That's great.
Erm he's wandering around collecting  
.
quite happily and enjoying himself thoroughly and not going to school, which I think are are three excellent things.
Erm  and my father-in-common-law in Liverpool is also running around frantically recording, but he's getting a limited variety of recordings, mainly educational.
Erm have you made contact with your human in Liverpool?
I haven't.
I'm hoping he will ring me this afternoon.
I  this evening.
I've left another phone message for him,
Right.
so it's very much a case whether he actually gets in contact with me.
Good oh.
Right.
Erm 
According to the last reference I looked up, erm Merseyside erm  is about  as big This is an old reference,
Mm.
but erm a tenth of that No sorry, three tenths of that is on the Wirral.
Mm.
Which erm
So that means we need thirty thousand words from the Wirral.
My parents live in the Wirral.
And they're taking a tape away on Saturday.
A machine away on Saturday.
Right.
Excellent.
Do you want more tapes for them to take away?
I've got ten.
I've haven't used any of them.
Right.
Erm I mean I can I Actually I haven't got all that many left, which I think is 
Sorry.
wonderful.
Okay.
Er but I mean tell them if they need to buy anything to get the receipts,
Yeah.
then you can claim 
Right.
Okay.
for it.
But I I've got to In fact I'll make myself a note here and now, I've got to talk to  and I'll get them to send some more tapes.
Right.
We can never have too many.
No.
Ho ho.
Erm   
Well we could, but if we get too many we can go into business selling them or something.
.
Well I think we have to give them back actually.
They've got British National Corpus written on them.
.
Yeah.
We should probably give them back when  we've finished with them .
If you do end up with er an extra box of ten or something erm could you label them up for me?
Yeah.
No problem.
It's no problem.
Erm   
And  start the sequence as well.
.
I decided it was a good idea to write things down rather than depending on the tape because erm I'm not actually going to get round to transcribing the tape quickly enough to use it as minutes.
.
Mm.
Erm  Yes well I've got lots of people recording everywhere which is nice.
Fine.
Great.
Erm David, I wrote to Margaret  at the Employment Training Unit,
Right.
so I hope to hear from her this week.
Okay.
Still nothing from the Conference Office.
.
But I'm not gonna worry about that until halfway through the week and then I'll write to them.
Do you have an address  for them ?
Er  it'll be  er University of York Conference Office, er Heslington Hall,
Right.
.
Y York, Heslington, York,
University Road.
Y O one five D D.
Yeah.
Er
Erm I know all that actually, so
Yes.
Is there a human?
No.
.
Not that I know about.
You don't know a name.
.
No.
They're all synthetics.
I went in
.
I went in and spoke to one of the secretaries who said she would er she would do it and send us material.
Right.
Okey-doke.
Erm 
There wasn't a  contact, no.
Okay.
Erm  .
This week, in fact tomorrow, I'm going to splash out an unbelievable amount of money and buy a transcription machine.
This transcription machine is going to be lent to be Derek and Clare, who can argue about who has it where and when.
Erm  it'll come with a set of headphones and a little doohickey for er 
Mhm.
turning the output into mono because at the moment it's stereo and it'll only come through one earhole.
Erm  Cos most of the 
.
Oh!
Actually most these tapes are recorded in stereo aren't they?
Yes.
Yes.
That's okay then.
Erm I most of the tapes that I've had in the past have been recorded mono, erm and I've needed a little doohickey to turn the  erm output into mono as well cos it's awfully off-putting spending seven and a half hours with the stuff coming in through one ear only.
.
Sensory deprivation.
Doohickey being the technical term for this is it?
Yes, and I've no idea how to spell it actually.
.
I'm gonna have real trouble with that.
Erm you can transcribe this one.
D D double O 
D double O 
D double O 
C K E Y.
Yeah.
You sure?
How do you spell dooberry then?
D O O B E R R Y.
Dooberry.
I'm not I'm not Erm I don't know.
I think it's 
No, I wouldn't agree with that.
it's B R E Y.
But certainly erm Or no  .
Doohickey is D double O is it?
Yes.
D double O H I C 
Good oh!
K E Y.
Okay.
I've come across that one before .
.
You sure it wasn't me that wrote it?
I'll tell you what,sin since I'll be  going along to Boston Spa we'll check in the dictionary  .
.
They've got in on the shelves there.
I think we need soundproofing for  these meetings .
.
At some point it'll be at the University.
The Oxford English .
But it won't be arriving there until they get this Well they have the C D ROM, they just haven't got it up and running .
Erm well they haven't got it networked yet but they have the C D ROM players there already .
Yeah.
But they ha I I I I went 
.
up and talked to the guy  sitting in front of them and he said Yes we've got it but we haven't got it on those yet.
So they have the C D ROM, they just haven't managed to  yet.
Or something..
Right.
Do I take that to mean there's gonna be a online dictionary?
Yeah.
dictionary.
There'll be an online computer-based dictionary.
How will you be able to get at it?
Through an ordinary Vax account?
No.
No.
No.
You've got to go 
.
into the library and go up and sit at the C D ROM terminal  .
Right.
.
I don't think you need a password for it.
Erm
You don't.
Ah.
And er 
So a bit li It will be a bit like the 
And you don't need a ticket to get into the library.
No you don't.
I've got a ticket anyway.
I've got a graduate 
Ah.
thing.
It would be a bit like the library's erm index facility.
Mm.
Interesting.
So.
I hope it'll crash less often than the index .
.
I doubt it..
.
Er 
Erm 
Right.
That'll be useful resource actually.
So 
Yes.
Erm 
Derek and I will organize ourselves about the transcription machine and 
Mm.
Okay.
Fine.
That's excellent.
Erm I'll also be buying  erm  your keyboard, some tapes and  a couple of ribbons.
Er keyboard five  
Not tapes.
Tapes.
Disks.
five disks and one ribbon.
Yes please.
And a ribbon.
Yeah.
Keyboard, five disks and one ribbon.
I already made a note of that actually but 
Yeah.
Five disks.
one ribbon.
.
Okay.
I checked and it is forty nine ninety five
Brilliant.
for the keyboard.
So I reckon I reckon the total of that will be just over sixty quid .
Yeah.
Should be.
Should be.
And I'll check about discounts.
Right.
And  possibly buy some stuff myself if that's what necessary to get it over a discount price.
I also need some disks.
I've done various things on my computer today and I can successfully make ASCII files.
Good.
Reas reasonable sized ASCII files.
Good.
So I reckon I could d do an entire transcription on Locoscript,t 
Right.
convert the whole thing into an ASCII and just  pass you the disk .
Yeah.
If you find yourself with a file that's big enough to manipulate but too big to turn into an ASCII file, cos it does use a lot of 
Yeah.
its processing to turn make a file into an ASCII file, don't worry, just give me the original.
Okay.
Erm because I've got erm a seven hundred and twenty 
Yeah.
K drive .
So it should be able to sort it out .
As well as the two hundred and seventy two K stupid little three- inch disks.
Erm
.
Yeah.
Which I don't approve of in the slightest.
Erm 
But I'd prefer to get ASCII files 
Yeah.
because then I don't have to do anything to them.
Yeah.
.
I'll bear that in mind because that will save me start splitting documents up
Mm.
and and transferring each part of the document into ASCII files.
Yeah.
Erm yeah.
Whatever's easiest for you
Right.
erm  is probably also going to be easier for me.
Erm we've done mileage and expenses claim forms and given you the bits and pieces.
Mhm.
David doesn't need any packaging any more so I don't have to remind myself to 
Well we've got all that packaging over there 
get it .
if you do need it.
Right.
They sent us nearly a box full of it .
That that was why I had a note for myself, but it's not necessary any more cos his parents are coming up .
Okay.
Erm somebody on my behalf please, erm preferably Clare actually who has a computer,
Yeah.
an Amstrad,f for which I can give you my letterhead and formatting and you can then write letters for me.
Good.
I like it.
I can yes.
Need somebody to talk to the D T I, since this was a D T I funded project, why don't we get them to let us record i a meeting or two.
.
Erm  parish council.
The What's On page in the local paper.
Public talks  and things.
Aha.
And the Clerk of the Court in York and in other towns.
Those are the things that occurred to me.
Okay.
They could all be contacted.
Parish A couple of parish councils in Nottinghamshire have been very happy to let my Dad record their open meetings.
.
And I don't see any reason why other Parish Councils shouldn't either.
Well there's erm a Fulford parish erm er council news sheet keeps turning up here 
Mm.
anyway and everybody just takes one look at it and after everybody in the house has taken one look at it it gets thrown in the bin, if it lasts that long.
Yes.
So I'll grab the next one and go along and contact them.
Right.
Yes, we get er an Osbaldwick  one.
Erm 
Right.
Right.
Things everybody else has done I suppose.
Erm  you know just about everything that I've done.
I've erm 
Yes.
hassled the Conference Office Monday.
Er ran into Tony  who's going to talk to his church people about religious meetings there.
Er did the  seminar.
Eventually.
.
Eventually.
Okay.
How were we to know there were gonna be two Hilton Hotels in Leeds?
There's only one in the bloody phone book!
.
There's j I looked in the phone book, there is only 
Yeah.
one.
You sent the recorder off to your father as well.
Sent the r yes, sent the recorder off up to 
Great.
Scotland, and as I say er said before they got er some taped seminars  taped sermons which they can send down.
Right.
Erm  that's the  most obvious things.
Something that occurred to me this week.
Erm  apparently one of the services that gets offered at Thompson Travel Agents
Mm.
is that er you can go in and you can sit and you can talk to them about what you want for a holiday
Yeah.
and they'll talk back to you about what your best options are and and do a s a sort of interview.
Yes.
So rather than sit at the counter and do it they they have rooms which you can go to and  erm get interviewed
Mm.
and talk about all their holiday options and how to tailor a holiday for them.
Mm.
Erm it might be worth contacting them  as being a professional consultation.
Right.
Do it.
.
Right.
Okay.
Or somebody do it.
It's just erm I'm 
I w I was just wondering if you wanted to write them a letter first  
Okay, Clare  can write a letter .
I'll I'll be  
.
If if you've got 
Yeah.
the time.
Have you the time  erm to write letters ?
I do have the time.
If you can bring me a er I don't know a disk with your 
I'll bring you all the disk with all the formats and whatever on it .
Yeah.
And if you tell me who to write to I sh I shall get to it and do it .
.
I'd I'd like you to write letters for me at least this week cos I'm going to be
Yes.
horrendously busy all week this week .
Th that's no problem at all 
That'll be nice.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Erm what I'll do actually seeing as I'm I get easy access to the town centre is I will go in there and see if they will agree to it, and if they won't 
Right.
I will say Well can I send you some information  a letter and that sort of thing ?
Yeah.
I'll do it that way round .
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay..
Right.
Have you got erm  paper?
Or I'd better provide you with some paper.
If you could provide me with some paper .
All all the bits and pieces.
Yeah.
I'll do that.
Okay.
Er stationery.
With an E. 
Cos you haven't stopped..
Pardon?
Because you haven't stopped.
What?
You're not stationary.
I'm lost actually.
Don't bother.
It's .
Erm 
I was in bed until what I thought was midday today and turned out to be  one o'clock .
And it was one o'clock..
And I haven't really recovered from the shock.
Erm this week I've  got a positive answer from B R about
Yes.
recording there and  that's good .
very excited about it.
Yes.
It's brilliant.
Yeah.
I was very pleased about.
And I'm meeting with appropriate people in B R on Monday to decide when they will let me record.
Mm.
And then it's just a case of providing them with tapes and tape recorders and they will wander off an and do the tapes for us.
Excellent.
So that's good news.
Erm my father received the recorder and tapes and is enthusiastic about getting recordings for us, and that's all set up for whilst he's in Scotland  next week .
How long's that going to be?
Erm he's in Scotland for about the next month, but I've asked him to do the recordings in the next week.
Right.
Then what's gonna happen to the recorder?
He'll send it back to me
Okay.
and I will probably ,
.
unless I hear from my contact in Liverpool, send it out to Manchester.
Right.
Next.
Okey-doke.
Super.
Erm did I say this last week?
I may have done, I may not have done.
When you send them send them Parcel Class but insure them for the  top amount,
Right.
which er it costs one pound something for  the insurance.
Erm it's about three quid to send them Parcel Post.
Yeah.
That that seems to be the most reasonable way of doing it, rather than sending it registered,
Yes.
which doesn't actually do anything except tell you that it got there.
That's right.
Yeah.
.
Er it does seem crazy to send them all round the country without insuring them.
Yeah.
So  I'll see to that.
Ah.
It is one of us.
Hello.
Telephone for Mr .
Excuse me.
Yes.
Okay.
A popular guy.
Cos I'm hoping cos I've got a in Manchester  get me some recordings from the public library.
Right.
Their meetings hopefully ,
Mm.
and their talks.
Mhm.
So that will be some stuff from Manchester as well.
Great.
Good.
Super.
Right.
Right.
Erm 
That was my achievements for the week.
Well I think that's The the B R thing certainly is a big achievement.
Erm  right.
Derek and I went to  the Guildhall.
Yes.
Erm and Derek was mildly successful erm and got  a  vague sort of agreement from the Deputy Returning Officer
Right.
about erm information about the upcoming candidates for the council elections.
Mm.
Erm and the receptionist was not at all useful
.
in giving me information about the weddings.
Erm she wasn't entirely with it.
So erm I didn't find out anything about the weddings.
Right.
.
.
Erm  So erm I'm going to ask my mother where one gets a marriage license .
.
Don't do that David, she'll 
 
go white overnight.
I will start  from scratch  on them.
Don't you just don't you go the Registry Office?
I really don't know.
I think there's just a Registry Office isn't there ?
I I have no idea.
I've never done it so I don't 
No.
know.
And I don't Intend to either.
Erm  Yeah, I imagine if you just look under Registry Office in the phone 
Mm.
Book there'll be   something.
Yes.
Mm.
The thing I did fail 
.
to do this week was I did actually see my landlord and meant to ask him about recording some tutorials 
Mm.
for us.
But unfortunately I did remember afterwards, having erm  berated myself for this that he is actually based in London at the 
Ah.
moment and so is out of our catchment area.
Right.
But I di One of the people that's moving back into my house is a supply teacher in the York area, so I will probably talk to him
Right.
about whether he can get any classroom situations
Mm.
.
S 
Do we still need stuff from schools in 
Yes.
the York area?
Yeah.
That's good.
Sue's erm  current school Sue  's current school have made positive-but-need-to-be-paid-for-it noises, so I'm going to telephone  their headmaster.
That's the first 
.
time we've come back with a need-to-be-paid isn't it?
Good heavens.
Erm   Actually it's not.
The Careers Service wanted erm to be paid as well.
They the Careers Services actually asked me who if anyone was going to make money out of it, and I said Well yes, me.
Mm.
Erm 
.
and they said Well in that case could we make some money out of it?
So I just gave them the statutory amount per tape
Right.
erm and they put it in their Christmas Fund or something.
Excellent.
Erm  but I I wasn't actually that surprised that the school er at a school asking to be paid for the tapes because erm  they've got to get their money from somewhere 
That's right.
and they ain't getting it off the Government at the moment ..
They they deserve it to a certain extent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm so I've got to telephone him  tomorrow and sort sort of make happy and erm forthright noises about money.
Right.
Erm and he may then let Sue record a couple of lessons.
Erm 
Right.
I'm ge starting to get a bit upset about not getting letters back from people.
I know I shouldn't really cos I shouldn't expect them to come back at all, but  it annoys me when 
.
you know three weeks ago I wrote to Scarborough College and the buggers haven't written back, even to acknowledge my letter..
It's a it's a bit downheartening.
It's  not nice.
.
The one thing I wanted to erm bring up in this meeting,
Yeah.
which you you've obviously had a mind to because you've done the breakdown about the various other regions,
Mm.
is what we're going to do about start collecting  in other regions, because we're getting to the stage where we've almost got North Yorkshire 
Yeah.
wrapped up .
I've been hoping to leave it erm and see what happens.
And what seems to be happening is that we're gradually remembering people we know in other regions and 
Yes.
starting with them as a basis.
Yeah.
Erm  probably the most fair way to do this  erm I mean fair to our friends and relatives in other r parts of the country, is to ask them if they could either send us their local papers or 
Mm.
a copy of their local phone book.
For which I'll pay.
Right.
Erm because those I mean the l a local Yellow Pages Or a local Thompsons actually, those are nice and narrow ,
Thompsons are better.
Yeah.
erm   and have postcodes in   Erm are very good ways of getting in touch with local organizations.
Yeah.
Erm 
Yeah.
I mean I mean I've written a letter to my cousins in South Wales asking them if they can point me at  any places that might record, but I'll actually make the contacts .
You've you've done South Wales have you?
Well I haven't I wouldn't say I've done it, I've just  asked them to make 
You've made a contact in South Wales.
asked them to make a contact.
I mean But by all means 
Okay.
make more contacts.
Yep.
I can do.
I don't think we have a problem We're not gonna not gonna have a problem with places getting asked twice.
Mm.
Erm  I don't 
Right.
think that's going to be a problem at all.
I will try and get something like that brought up from North Wales
Right.
at the beginning of next term because I know somebody in North Wales at the moment  .
Right.
I've I've written to a friend in in Anglesey
Mm.
as well erm but  I mean if those come to anything at all they'll only come t gonna come to something fairly local aren't they.
Yeah.
On Anglesey and in Pembroke.
Right.
Pembrokeshire.
So  you know Wales is a big cou big  Well it's not a big country at all but it's big compared to a county, so
Yeah.
That was a positive response by the way from Scotland
Good.
and that my parents have the thing, it arrived Thursday morning,
Good good.
and er they're making recordings.
They've got in touch with the three people that they've got at 
Yes.
schools and they'll They probably won't manage anything in the next week because the schools are going on holiday at 
Yeah.
the end of the week,
Yeah.
but they will be  quite happy to make recordings er and so that's three different schools in the west of Scotland.
Excellent.
When's the first consignment of Scottish tapes?
Erm  don't know.
Don't know when they're coming.
But 
Right.
anyway, erm  there will be tapes on the way and they're consulting with other people too,so.
Right.
When  Actually I should probably mention this.
When tapes come into me I have a listen to the beginning and end of them all to sort of see what sort of quality they are  
Right.
erm  and also to try and work out  which speakers are which 
.
so that I can check that against the form and get the form 
Right.
back to people if I have a problem with it.
Erm where I find I can't understand the regional accent I'm going to give them back to the person  who recorded them 
.
and say Here, you transcribe this.
.
So I've got a feeling you're going to end up transcribing a lot of the north of the border stuff.
I don't think so.
But anyway.
Well.
No problem.
I can do that .
Erm 
It's only four hundred thousand words.
The younger the people get, I find that not wanting to be erm  whatever, regionalist or anything like that,
but I find that Or ageist, but the younger people get the more problem I have with their accents.
Yes.
Erm and the further west in Scotland and the younger they get the  more problem I have with their accents .
.
Right.
I don't know why this should be.
Okay.
Erm but it's true.
I mean one of getting round that is erm for Derek and I to transcribe them because then it's fairly easy for me to turn round and say Listen to this.
What did he  say ?.
Yes.
Yes.
So that'll be 
Yeah.
One way of working that .
Right.
Erm I mean that sounds seems quite reasonable to me.
Erm it also means that in the case of tapes that have come from your parents you're more likely to know one or two of the speakers and therefore have a less difficult time sorting out which one of these twelve 
Actually 
speakers is  this 
I 
person on the list .
I I can think of a I can think of a few th of them who are going to be completely incomprehensible  to you .
Good.
You can have all of those.
.
And welcome.
We don't mind at all..
.
Erm yeah.
I mean er  I'll I'll still need them to come to me for er entering 
Yeah.
into the books and everything
Yeah.
No problem.
but then you can have them back.
.
Erm I don't know if I gave you, and if I didn't I need to,the things that I've called recordings logs, that are different than meeting logs.
Yes.
You 
Can you get people to fill Or f do yourself fill those in rather than the meeting logs?
Right.
I was I was 
Because 
filling up my supply of each.
Yeah.
Erm
Erm  unless it's actually a meeting  that you're recording use the other things cos they're just they've got bigger spaces for writing down what people's first words were and stuff like that,
Right.
erm and I just find them easier to cope with.
I'm gonna check with   whether we actually need to fill in a meeting log for every recording situation ,
Mm.
or whether some kind of statement about who's there and what they're doing is enough.
Mhm.
Cos I think these meeting logs are a pain in the neck cos they've got  the you know the boxes are about this big and you need to be a spider to write in them.
.
And a small one at that.
Erm  and th the bit for notes isn't 
And we wouldn't want any spiders around would we?
big enough.
No we wouldn't want any spiders around.
.
Erm
Moving swiftly along.
That's speciesist that is.
Pardon?
Specieism.
Yes.
Speciesist.
Speciesist.
You're discriminating 
Yes.
against them on the grounds that they're they're crawly 
 
little things.
.
That they're th No,th I'm not I'm discriminating o against them on the grounds that they have legs that do that.
That's what I I've thought about it for a long
.
time and that's what I find horrific about spiders, crabs, all most crustacea in fact.
Erm yellow centipedes,erm
.
And if anybody comes up behind me and does that I scream and elbow .
.
It's true.
. Empirically tested.
Just ask Spike.
.
Erm
All those present  have been warned..
.
Right.
Yes.
So don't bother.
Erm  Erm erm erm.
I seemed to have worked my way down to the bottom of my list.
Erm  
Congratulations.
Thank you..
.
It wasn't a very full list cos erm   er it didn't occur to me until about seven o'clock this evening that I had to go out quite soon and then I just ran around frantically doing things  .
You thought it was still six didn't you?
W erm no really.
Well  it was still light so it hadn't di I didn't really realize how late it was getting.
Er I was still slobbing around in my dressing-gown and you know yesterday's clothes and so I I I thought I'd better  get up and do stuff.
. Erm  yeah.
So I'm I'm a bit unprepared, but that's everything I think that I have to say.
Right.
Can we go through  Unless anybody else has anything to say?
No.
Right.
Can we go through erm  what we're going to do this week so I can make a note of it so I'll know this week, rather than last week when I didn't so I didn't.
Now does anybody know 
.
shorthand?
Not that anybody else but myself could read back.
Er I don't know shorthand but I thought y somebody who did know  shorthand would probably have a less hard time than I do writing down notes .
.
Erm but it probably wouldn't  make much difference.
Erm 
I I've learnt the Pitman school but to a basic level and a long time ago and a lot of it is now forgotten..
Fine.
Not a problem.
Erm  okay.
What are we gonna do this week?
I'll write it down your names.
.
Underneath them I'll write down what  to do.
Oh.
You don't need one for me.
Another another point .
Don't I?
Oh.
No, you're you're off limits this week aren't you?
Another point about erm  what we did this week, we went down to the Guildhall.
I mentioned that.
.
Yes.
Yeah.
David was saying .
Mhm.
Right.
This week.
Erm after my meeting on Monday I shall hopefully start recording at B R.
And I will  continue to pursue trying to get a contact with Clive in Liverpool  and  probably have the tape recorder and tapes returned from my father.
Right.
Which I will then turn around and put to good use,most probably in Manchester.
If you can  let me know who you want me to write to or give me a source book to start 
Yes.
writing letters from I will also start on the letter writing for you.
Okay.
And I will go into the travel agents in town.
Thomas Cook's.
Thomas Cook.
That's the these people who apparently do con consultations on
Where are they?
individual holidays.
Are they the ones that are 
They're right se behind beside the Royal Bank on the corner .
The Royal Bank.
Yeah.
Thought so.
.
And I will see if I can get erm a designer interview holiday consultation taped from them.
Right.
Okay.
Do they have with an E or not?
Cook.
Er no, without.
Er no, Cook.
There's no E there.
Okay.
It looks wrong, somehow.
Doesn't matter.
I don't care.
That's the way they do it.
how they spell their name.
Er
What are you going to do this week?
Transcription work.
We hope.
Erm  we hope, yes.
Probably not till till towards the end of the week.
Erm   
Whatever.
Erm  I've still got 
Make suggestions for people I can go out and hassle in the first couple of days of the week.
Because I 
Yeah.
Until the Conference Office say yea or nay, there's nothing I can do literally there.
Mm.
Until  any of the other ones bear fruit, because the Guildhall I can't get anything on the elections till April the sixth, erm I can't get anything from the Scottish tapes until they start arriving, erm whatever.
So all my sources are in progress but 
Right.
nothing's about to turn up.
So suggest something and I can go some How about getting some tapes not in North Yorkshire perhaps?
Yeah.
Driving over to Leeds or something if we if there's anybody we can contact over there?
Erm it's making the initial contacts that's the problem.
Erm  I'm I'm in two minds as to whether it's best to always write first or to to phone first whenever possible.
I think it's probably best  er probably good to phone first but I'm  erm worried about phone bills,
Right.
and how to deal them.
Phone calls made from non-local phone calls In fact local c phone calls as well made from my house can be made directly onto my business  Mercury account.
Erm  I've got a Mercury account at home and I've got it set up so that after the Mercury number you type in a user code, and one of my user codes is for the business.
Mm.
So.
I'm quite amenable to people coming over and using my phone  for making business-related phone calls.
Erm  Particularly 
Alright then.
if those people also supply me with never-ending cups of tea and coffee while they're there.
.
.
Cos that's what I live on during the day is never-ending supplies of tea and coffee.
Well  I don't have any problem with  going out.
How about I could I could go down and just go to some places in Hull on spec.
Mm.
Go into the University and see if there're there are any conferences there that I can ask.
Because that's not something we want to go through their Conference Office for if we only want to do  a meeting,
Mm.
something we'd just ask the people who are organizing the conference.
Erm I could go out to Harrogate and see if there's anything on the Conference Centre there,
Mm.
or phone the Conference Centre  .
The the thing is Yeah, I mean anything  Rather than travelling, telephone, because you have to run up an awful lot of telephone calls before it's worth driving over and doing it
Yeah.
in person.
And the the time involved in driving over and then wandering around the city  is  .
Yes but if I'm doing nothing else Monday.
Erm 
You know.
Yeah but if you could be doing other things, like phoning  
Yeah.
Fair enough.
F forty places
Yeah.
rather than Or phoning twenty places 
Yeah.
rather than visiting three.
Okay.
Erm  I I was suggesting to Clare and David that wherever we do know people who don't live in this region we could get those people to, at my expense, send us a copy of their local Thompson Directory,which is an excellent resource for getting in touch with local businesses and other organizations.
But I mean it's a subset of the things that appear in Yellow Pages and also contains all the postcodes we're ever going to need to to use.
Okay.
So anyone that anybody knows who lives anywhere,
.
get them to send their local  Thompson  .
.
Erm  and I'll  refund the cost.
.
I mean I d I dunno actually.
Is it possible to phone I imagine it's possible to phone B T and get them to send 
Erm
Directories.
Yes.
It is possible.
Who does Thompsons?
Is it B T?
Erm no.
No.
I think Thompsons is  .
Thompsons.
But
Oh.
Yes, Thompsons are separate.
there'll be a  Thompsons 
Yes.
.
Erm you can There's a list at the back of  the Yellow Pages on on Yellow Pages and phone books .
For for f Yellow Pages.
Yeah.
Erm they're all up in the library.
I don't know if the Thompsons are in the library.
Mm.
They might be.
But it it's inconvenient to go to the library, write down lots of addresses and then come away again.
I'd like to actually have them on hand.
Erm you can't afford them.
I can't afford Yellow  Pageses or phone books, but Thompsons might be a different matter.
They might be cheaper cos 
Yes.
they're smaller.
Erm but there's more of them.
Also Well  here's another thing.
Anybody we know, can we get them to send last year's Yellow Pages and Thompsons, which won't 
Yeah.
cost them anything except for postage and and won't therefore cost us anything but postage?
Yeah.
That's  .
That's a good idea actually.
Let's do that .
.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm 
Right.
We don't really need to confer on who we're asking because I I'm I don't think  
If we get duplicate last year's Yellow Pages it's going to be such a problem.
I mean we'll have a spare one, yes.
Oh yeah!
I mean what a hassle.
We'll have to take them down the recycling.
.
Right.
Okay.
You know.
Whoa!
Erm 
In that case I can spend Monday h er making phone calls
Yeah.
er around probably West Yorkshire.
I'll take down numbers I'll go to the library and take down num phone numbers and call places in the afternoon.
And I 
Right.
can hassle anybody who still around for phone directories and so on.
Mm.
Do you have a touch-tone  phone here?
Yeah.
.
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
It it's actually bee-bee-bee-bee-beep?
In that case I can give you my Mercury my business Mercury number and you can make phone calls on the company from here.
But only if I really really trust you..
Us.
Yeah.
Who you m buy a used car from this man ?
I do get a fully itemized bill.
.
Yeah.
And I've I'm I have no compunctions ,
Yeah.
S as Spike knows, about phoning places that I where I don't recognize the  number and asking them who the fuck they are and when he called them ..
.
.
Well the only one that you have to worry about with me is if it it's a twenty-five-minute 
O eight nine eight ..
er twenty-five-minute call to the States or something .
Transatlantic   yeah .
Just don't do it on my account.
Erm 
Oh it's alright, they don't cost too much.
Would that apply to me as well?
What ?
Because there's 
Have you got a touch-tone phone?
No, but I was thinking of using this one here.
Yeah.
Because there's a few sort of non-local calls I could make to get 
Yeah.
phone directories sent .
Business calls, do it on the Mercury account.
I mean Yeah I'll I'll give you the   er no I don't think   Mercury account .
That's probably more sensible than having people come round to use my phone as well.
Erm  it doesn't depend on me being in.
Erm  erm I did and try and use 
.
I don't know it.
I'll have to 
Ah.
Right.
go home and find it out .
Erm did try and erm use it when I first rang Margaret ,
Yes.
er but I couldn't get it to work.
It was a local call.
Aha.
You need to put the S T D code in for a local call .
Oh right.
That would explain it.
You press the Mercury button, wait for it to finish then O nine O four boo-boo-boo-boom.
Yes .
It'll Mercury are only supposed to be for non-local calls.
Ah.
Right.
But in fact it doesn't cost any more to
.
erm  dial the local S T D code and then use that call d do the call on the S T D code.
Right.
And then it appears on the Mercury bill.
Ah.
as if by magic .
So as if by magic.
Puff!
There it is!.
Yes.
.
You wouldn't believe  the things that turn up on our bill.
You really wouldn't.
Erm
I didn't when I first saw it.
Spike Spike didn't  Spike didn't know why it wouldn't work.
Erm  right, well, that's why.
Right.
Fair enough.
Yes.
Right.
Since I've got to write to Captain Andrew anyway I will get hold of  addresses of people er like Sam in Warwickshire.
Right.
a useful contact.
Where is Captain Andrew?
War er C Coventry .
Coventry.
He also will therefore be a  useful contact .
Yes.
Erm  if you've lost your  .
You want his voice on tape?.
Not necessarily.
But but he knows people I'm sure .
Also he's in the process of setting up a business.
He is in fact .
He is.
Any any part of that is a legitimate  erm
Recording scenario.
You know anything anything
Yeah.
where he talks to people about setting up his business is a legitimate thing to record.
And since he's the one initiating the meetings all we have to do is get his consent to erm the her his s signature, and the other people's sort of  
Mm.
And his verb 
Okay.
Erm.
Alright.
Some time has passed, for the benefit of the tape.
.
Thank you.
Erm  er so far my list of what we're going to do this week includes  for Derek erm fi tracking down non-local copies of Yellow Pages by phoning people and hassling people who are about to go home.
Right.
Erm I shall phone the Harrogate Conference Centre since they have a big and er quite famous conference centre.
If I can get hold of the  erm  the name If I can remember the name.
There is a conference centre somewhere out in the wilds of nowhere in Derbyshire which I drove past coming back from Buxton.
If you phone in t erm  the Talking Yellow Pages and say I need a conference centre in Derbyshire, they'll probably tell you that one .
Talking Yellow Pages?
Yeah, it's erm it's not one nine two, it's it's something different.
Erm you can phone them up and ask them for a Yellow Pages listing and they and they'll give at random a listing from the Yellow Pages in whatever area you ask for.
You can't ask for a specific  taxi company or 
Ah right, okay.
anything like that, but you can say Can you just tell me the name of two taxis? the number of two taxi companies in this area? and they will .
Or you or you could ask for the the number of all the conference centres in 
I want a I want a remote conference centre in Derbyshire please.
Right.
One that's not in a town.
Talking I shall try the Talking Yellow Pages.
.
It it it really was, it was the middle of nowhere and we drove by it and  It's a conference c Conference centre?
Er  and But that would be conference material from Derbyshire, if we could 
Yeah.
could get that.
.
And since we don't seem to have any recordings yet from Derbyshire.
No.
Is erm  Where's Doncaster?
What county is Doncaster in ?
Doncaster's South Yorkshire.
Is it?
Right.
Okay.
I have a  friend in Doncaster.
But erm  Yeah I don't know anybody in Derbyshire.
Nobody lives there do they?
Er lots of people live in the Peak District.
B R have 
Yeah but nobody we know.
Cumbria.
The  section of B R that I work for 
Dave .
most directly and 
And   .
I'm sorry, say again?
The  particular section of B R 
Yes.
that I work for erm being the Q S has its main headquarters in Derbyshire, so it's just possible I may be able to get some business contacts in Derbyshire .
That would be good.
I'll see what I can do.
That would be very good.
I can hassle for business contacts in these areas at conferences as soon as I get to a conference.
Yeah.
Basically any conference lets us gets get lots more business contacts.
Right.
I think I'll I'll not wait for Er if nothing comes in the post tomorrow I won't wait for the conference centre to get in touch with me, I'll write to them tomorrow and drop it in .
How about ph how about phoning them?
Oh you'll dro If you write to i If you write to them and drop it in that's fine then .
Mm.
Yeah.
Cos if
I since you've already contacted them in person, erm phoning them's not going to you know reassure them that we're a bona fide company
Yeah.
erm in quite the way that sending them a letter on headed notepaper is.
Okay..
Plus the fact you don't have a n er contact name so it's going to be more difficult to get connected to anyone  .
Yes.
Yes  I'll just end up talking to a secretary whereas something 
Mm.
will be plonked on somebody's 
Well 
desk at some point if I write .
if you end up going to the office and it's the same layout as it it it was and the same people there,
Aha.
it was the secretary on There was only the one secretary in the office when I went in but there are two desks, one on the left and one on the right, and it's the one at the one on the right.
Right.
That was who was dealing with  when I 
Okay.
went in there.
Okey-doke.
Erm.
I shall also write to the Captain for addresses and and businesses and if he can help us and so forth.
Right.
Are you going to erm  telephone the Hull Conference Centre as well?
Erm I don't know if there's a conference centre but there's a university.
.
I'll phone Hull Uni then.
I used to have a friend at Hull University but we're doing this a year too late.
He's graduated.
Ah!
My ex head of department's wife used to teach at Hull University.
We're not getting into tenuous connections here, but!
.
No no, I mean Well okay.
.
Er she's also somebody in my department so
Right.
used to teach there and she'd probably know the right person to write to.
Or to telephone.
I'll ask her and then get back to one of you two to actually do the letter contact.
Erm Nick's mother erm is in the Psychology Department at Nottingham.
.
Little Nick?
Yes.
Nick .
.
I've never heard his surname, he's just little Nick as far as I'm concerned .
Okay.
Little Nick.
Erm 
I'll have to phone Nick  tonight to see if the Captain has a phone number now rather than just an address cos if I can phone him it'll be a lot easier.
Have you spoken to Whit about the ?
Yes.
Is it this week or next week ?
I s it's next week cos he's home this week.
Yes.
Erm if the message got passed 
Yes.
on  erm
I mentioned it to him last week er last night actually.
Yes.
Erm he he he does re remember as far as I I can tell.
Mm.
But er basically the message didn't get passed on to him when I left it er  the last time and he then did the tour Monday not knowing that we could have been recording it because 
Ah.
nobody'd told him, and then when I got in touch with him  erm he said no nobody had told him about it.
So  And he's doing one er not tomorrow but in a week's time and will be perfectly happy to record it.
Good.
Good good.
So 
Erm
I'll go along and be Well actually I'll get him to do that and instead of being bored about the  for forty five minutes or whatever I 
You can be bored about it when you type the tape.
Yeah.
But I I  that way I only have to hear it once.
Yeah.
Er and I can I can go and er  I can
Wendy!
.
I can go round
I just spent three hours last night talking to him and I've I've had enough for the week that's all.
I can't do it now, I've already done the tour.
I'm sorry,I I took the cowards's option last night.
Instead of being lured up to Whit's room with you and erm  other people
.
last night I said Derek Let's go home ..
.
Well it was okay cos Aaron was there, but Whit and Aaron had a bit of a er an argument at one point ,
Oh.
and it was a pain cos
When doesn't Whit have an argument?
What were 
Well 
they arguing about this time?
Well they were being Whit was being unpleasant about Aaron, which is calls made from non-local phone calls In fact local c phone calls as Whit t to you know to make comments 
Yes.
about his appearance or whatever.
But it was because Aaron said a mildly humorous comment about somebody in one of Whit's photos who turned out to be one of Whit's very good friends.
And er  Well so what?
She does look strange cos she's got bright white hair and purple lipstick on..
Oh right.
Sorry, but it's true!.
.
Erm  yeah.
That's getting off the subject a bit but never mind.
Okay.
Anyway yes, Whit's going to  us at some stage and I will wander round town while he's doing his talk and then transcribe it  
Right.
so I only have to  once .
Can erm one of you  look in this week's Advertiser, and any sort of  talks and things that are on this week if they've got a phone number to contact, give them a buzz and see if they mind us recording it.
Derek?
 
There are some talks happening this week.
Is it It's the Advertiser that have the What's On section.
That was it.
Erm 
Unfortunately that's last week's.
I'll check our our this week's ones cos they'll be lying around.
Right.
Okey-doke.
Erm  
Excuse me while I find our papers.
It's 
Meanwhile.
no good for me because I'm  working in the evening but Minster F M has a a list of What's On that night every night.
Mm.
Erm I don't know when They they they play it about  quarter past er no about quarter to seven 
Mm.
and then they I think they play it earlier than that as well.
That's .
Erm 
It's best to  find them ahead of time because that gives us a chance to contact them beforehand.
Yes.
Yes.
I think it's unfair to anybody to show up with a tape recorder and ask them on the spot cos it puts them on the spot.
Yes.
Erm I don't like putting people on the spot if I can possibly 
No.
avoid it cos you know you lose goodwill that way.
Erm 
Erm but 
But the Advertiser does have quite a lot of What's Onies.
What's Onies?
What the hell's a What's Ony?
.
Erm .
Sorry.
Just for the record ,
Yes.
is that I E S or I S?
I have not the  remotest idea David .
.
I'm so sorry.
. It's probably E S actually cos it was it was me trying trying to find a plural for 
Ah.
What's On..
I I th I thought I thought it was I S actually from the way you said it the first time, but that was just a guess.
No comment.
Not a guess it's 
Well how do you say erm the plural of bus?
Buses.
Buses, yeah.
Sounds like an I S .
 Busi.
Octopodes.
.
Octopodes,yes.
It's the correct plural of octopus.
Eddie found it out one time.
It thought it was octopi.

Great.
Right.
Erm  Okey-doke.
.
And if you can remember to bring me some headed notepaper as well, so 
Th er I haven't actually Yeah I'll bring you some  headed notepaper but you shouldn't actually need it  except if people want This person is doing this on behalf of.
Right.
Erm all the other stuff I've just got a little header set up in the file on 
Right.
on a template.
Yeah.
The you know the the  little header.
Mm.
I'm going to have some  headed notepaper as soon as I can get the laser printer printing  out things that I tell it to  rather than printing out Courier Ten.
I'm having a bit of trouble with Spike's laser printer at work cos it's not a real  It it says it's a Hewlett-Packard Two Plus but it ain't.
Oh.
Mm.
So It's actually a Panasonic something and I haven't got the printer driver for it.
Okay .
And I can't phone up WordPerfect Corp and say 
Mm.
.
Can I buy a printer driver for this? because they'll say What's your registration number?
they'll say What's your registration number?
and I'll say I haven't got one yet because I can't afford to buy er a non-pirate copy of WordPerfect  until next month.
Sorry.
.
Mm.
But er anyone who feels like making a headed notepaper and getting it laser printed is welcome so to do.
Alright.
Well erm 
Well when we've got a company logo we should do that.
I've got a company logo.
It looks like this.
There is a company lob =go.
It's dead pretty .
Lobo?
Here we go.
Company lobo..
Lobo, yeah.
.
Let's get one of those.
.
Sometimes I feel I could do with one .
.
Yes.
Aha..
Mm.
Oh it 
Lovely.
it's just that it's the 
It looks sort of 
Erm  what we really need er .
Erm 
But there there's no
The problem is we can't use the can't use the CompServe one.
Er you could  you could print one off.
Erm 
We'd only need one .
For a start erm the typeface we wanted 
It looks something like that.
The type face we wanted isn't on the  the whatsit laser printer.
I'd also like it in shadow 
.
if at all possible.
Oh, yeah.
Er the other thing is  
So  i i it's a standard you know dinky little thing like y you us you use You know the  with their little twirly thing and er the you saw the 
Oh no.
Productions with their little red triangle and dots thing .
No I think I think the word is quite adequate actually .
Yeah.
That's great.
Y 
Fine.
the fancy letters the M and the T really need a powerful pack like CorelDraw.
Yeah.
Which  .
Eddie !
Eddie!
Erm 
Who doesn't have a laser printer.
Yes,
No, but 
but he can do the  
But does have CorelDraw.
He does have CorelDraw and erm CorelDraw would use P Postscript  erm which we can import onto the P Cs and dump onto the  self-service laser printer.
Erm
And a partridge in a pear tree.
.
I assume you understand what all that means .
At the university.
.
.
I know what it means.
Erm
Erm
Well you've got 
But it does require me going to see Eddie.
Erm I'd like to see Eddie cos I didn't get to see him this time or last time .
Well we could we could arrange to drive over 
Well Eddie's going to be 
And see Eddie.
Yeah Eddie is going to be busy the whole time 
Aha.
because he's working for his course.
He has 
Mm.
er course work to do the whole time.
But erm  I can phone him er Have you got his number as well?
Mm.
Right, okay.
Well you could phone him if you 
Mm.
wanted.
Erm and we could say We we need a company logo done.
Cos i if we said we we needed it in order to get some of this money
Yeah.
that he's going to get some of then erm that might more of an incentive for him to
Well he might for instance let us come over and and play with CorelDraw for an hour in one evening or something like that.
How long do you think it would take you to do that on CorelDraw?
Erm 
Our resident CorelDraw expert.
I could I could do that in an hour.
I could d I could do a complete letterhead and just that just that logo as an E P S F that you could stick into WordPerfect.
Mm.
Ooh.
Erm  
Right.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Er 
Then all I need to do is to find a printer driver for Spike's laser printer at work 
Erm well er if it was E P S F you almost certainly could use .
That's true.
.
.
Which that isn't.
But 
But the University have Wor WordPerfect don't they?
Online.
Yes.
The university have WordPerfect 
Yes.
on the machines.
Yes.
So 
This could work couldn't it?
Could work .
Yes.
Okay.
It's a cunning plan.
It is actually.
I have a cunning plan My Lord .
Let's get let's just get it on  though.
.
Erm okay let's get Eddie  
Erm I I reckon I reckon I could do it in an hour.
Erm 
The thing is if we can get that erm and  We can al we could also put it on business cards is another thing .
Mm.
I can go and get a run of business cards done at some point.
Mm.
Ooh that's something 
Erm 
else I have to do is find a somebody that'll do cheap photocopying.
Get like an account with somebody.
u w
Erm  I mean it really requires a P C and a copy of CorelDraw.
Erm  however 
I've got A P C.
You have a P C.
Erm But I'd 
Er however 
I'm running low on  memory now .
.
Yes.
Erm
And I can't yet afford a P C.
Erm
Mm..
I can't afford a new copy of CorelDraw.
However I might be able to get erm the copy that I Eddie's copy isn't entirely legal erm and I got it for him.
I might be able to get another copy of it.
.
How big is it?
I mean is it a massive program?
I imagine it'd be quite huge .
Erm it it was compressed onto six disks.
.
But that includes three I think three disks were full of  erm 
Sample stuff isn't it.
clip-art.
Which we don't need.
Mm.
Erm 
Yeah.
we don't need any clip-art.
Erm
Which means it's on three disks .
Can it run off the disks?
Can it run off
No.
It can't.
Be Because it's compressed.
Because it's compressed.
Erm 
I mean how big 
But you don't need to keep it.
Well, how big will that decompress into?
Erm
Well the total amount on three disks is what, two meg ?
If I have it I'd wanna keep it.
You know what I'm like.
I haven't got two meg of memory.
I've got about a meg and a half.
And that that fills up my hard disk.
Well that 
Aha.
So that 
Right.
you couldn't use it.
It fills it up 
Yeah.
too much to be used.
Right.
Erm 
And that's including my on-disk compression thing that that erm 
Oh dear.
Oh.
fiddles around with
Dear.
all sort of crap.
Right.
Erm 
Well that Actually that's on my disk cos we did have two the the disk partitioned and it's my half of it that's got a meg and a half left.
I don't know what Spike's half's got left.
.
But er probably not very much .
Knowing Spike not much.
.
Knowing Spike it's probably not much.
.
However 
Okay.
I'll speak to Simon.
I'll speak to Simon erm about borrowing his P C at work.
Doug has a P C. 
Right.
Okay.
Doug has a P C.
I will
 
Go get Doug, see what he's Yeah.
Just see how much space he's got.
Erm
And tell him it's temporary.
Yeah.
And I'll see if I can get a copy of CorelDraw.
Because it will be a lot easier than going over to Bradford.
Erm 
Yeah.
Although it would be nice to go over to Bradford.
Yes.
And it means that we could make changes if we needed to.
That's true.
Yes.
Er 
Er now, the source was at university which means that he's gone gone home.
He's at  Court, he might not have gone home.
Not  Court, erm   House.
Might not have gone home.
I thought they were planning to er  make  term time only.
.
No idea.
I don't know.
Erm   I'll see Erm I know that Richard  has a copy of that and Eddie has a copy  .
Mm.
I'll see  what I can do.
Right.
Erm  I will buy a copy of it when I have  access to a P C.
Erm  erm 
How much is it?
The new one is about two hundred and sixty pounds
.
for the big one.
Er a hundred and ninety five for the smaller version which doesn't have a .
It's a bit excessive.
But it's the best package in existence.
Mm.
They've got it at the Law College and I've I've spent some lunchtimes fiddling with it and thinking I want!
I want!
I want!
It's very easy to do pretty things with it.
Mm.
Did you did Wasn't it CorelDraw that you guys used to make the erm  badge for our Cop Two Thousand game?
Erm  yes.
Eddie did that, yes.
Mm.
Yes I've still got that somewhere.
Erm
In fact   I may even have them  be in here.
. No they're not.
They were really good.
Doug's P C isn't suitable because the monitor's crap.
Steer's 
.
P C would possibly get it  .
In what sense is the monitor crap?
Er it won't do colour, erm
It doesn't need to.
It's a black and white logo.
it it it it it's it's it's also got a erm er It's got no mouse  for the computer.
It's  Anyway Steer's might get it running,
Okay.
er but there're some really nifty ones in the Chemistry Department which cou Doug could borrow for an hour and a half of an evening.
So.
I'm not a fr free in the evening.
No.
We need it 
Yeah.
er when Derek when 
But 
David's free.
But weekend?
Maybe, yeah.
Yeah.
Cos er an hour and a half on a Saturday evening.
We could  manage it.
Mm.
Erm 
We can get a P C 
If we can do this ourselves I'd really like to .
Yes.
Erm cos 
Er 
I I definitely don't wanna pay  you know somebody 
Yeah.
like  sixty quid just to make a logo that we can do ourselves.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Th there is no w er problem whatsoever about getting a P C which is of suitable capability.
Right.
And we just need Doug to be around t 
Well.
If  erm
Or if Simon  can bring one home from work .
Doug's Doug's machine has reasonably high graphics doesn't it?
It's not C G A?
Er  no, Doug's machine is crap.
Steer's is quite good as far as I can tell.
Er erm .
I've got a V G A.
bloody space.
I dunno, I could I could back up and remove WordPerfect, which frees about another meg  and a half of memory .
Erm well it it was on It was compressed onto three disks, so I guess it's probably going to be about four meg.
Mm.
Well.
Doug's machine has four and a half meg free.
It doesn't need a mouse and  it will run on a C G A.
Erm
Well, I think it might work then.
But I can't guarantee it.
Suck it and see as my Grandmother used to say to me..
Indeed.
Okay,
Pardon?
I'll chase that up this week cos it won't take  .
What did she use to say?
Suck it and see.
.
Don't tell that to Spike!.
.
Bless him!
.
Erm 
.
Moving quickly on.
Erm okay I've got a list of what Derek's gonna do, I've got a list of what Clare's gonna do.
Erm  I'm gonna come round tomorrow and bring 
Yeah.
some letter writing stuff.
And David's gonna convalesce.
David's gonna convalesce.
David's gonna convalesce.
Yes.
Erm  it'll be alright I'm sure .
I know.
You'll be fine.
Don't worry.
Erm    Yes and I'll chase up  chase up erm a copy of CorelDraw.
Right.
And I'm going to get some tapes to Clare and the letter writing stuff, find out about a photocopying account, talk to  about more tapes,transcription notes, erm meeting log forms, demographic transcription, and editing of transcription that we do.
Yeah.
Gonna write to the University Conference Office,erm and talk to the head of Sue's school or write to the head of Sue's school.
Erm 
That sounds reasonable.
You're going to give us your M Mercury account number.
Mercury account number.
Oh yes I've got a further list down here.
Mercury account number, talk to Connie   erm who used to be at Hull.
And I'll leave the talking to Eddie about CorelDraw for 
Yeah.
for other people to do.
.
Right.
Should I phone him up then?
No.
Not yet.
Not 
Wait until David's erm  researched getting a computer in York .
Cos it would be easi it's a lot easier to do it here.
Cos i i it takes it would take an entire 
Yeah.
evening to go out to Keighley.
Erm 
Er in fact it would take an entire evening to go out to Keighley.
It's a bloody long way.
Whereas it's  
Yeah.
it's a lot more convenient  
.
could come round here 
Mm.
.
Mm.
Erm  I mean it'll take a while to install .
Mm.
Waiting for the program to install.
Right.
Well I'll leave that with you  to see what what comes out.
But I mean in the meantime we're quite happy quite happy carrying with with the silly little letterhead that I've got cos it says 
Yeah.
who we are.
It's just I'd like something  printed .
What about the P Cs  in the P C room in Langwith?
Erm
All you need's a Vax account.
Yeah but they don't have very much memory in them.
They don't have enough memory  in them to load up very much.
And you can't put it on c you can't put it 
If you if you network them you've got hardly any, and even er unnetworked I think they've only got two meg.
But you can't do something clever like dump it all onto  my scratch quota for example?
No.
Erm 
Okay.
Ah well.
No you can run They're big enough to run a diskful of game but not something that takes more than one disk.
Erm  er 
Okay.
Right.
Are we done?
I think we are.
Right.
Shall we go away then?
Mhm.
Erm 
Okay.
Okay.
