Right then!
Leading on from last week  we were looking at  menu planning  and I actually asked you to bring in some menus.
Who actually managed to get a menu?
Yep!
Yeah.
Right, let's have a look!
Well  that's a shame innit?
What?
Somewhere.
It's only you !
You might want to use those a little later.
Yeah.
Right, hold on to them cos you'll want them a little later right?
Right!
Can anyone tell me what the  four most common ones are?
Yep!
Yep!
Yep!
Er, plat du jour.
Right!
Okay then.
What do each of those mean?
Suzanne?
Erm  the  table d'hote 
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
is er  a choice out of the main course is a choice out of two  and everything else  is set.
Or is it a choice of two for each course?
Your telling me?
It's a choice out of two for each one.
Right.
Erm, the  er  cote du jour is a set menu.
Yes it is, can you expand on that?
Er  er
No.
Set price menu.
Yes, the price would probably be set.
So, I gave you two examples  and I said that it was often
Chef du jour.
Yes!
Good!
Well done!
And
Set budget.
It was set which to er  and it looked different.
It usually the chef's speciality.
Okay.
Erm  Gareth!
The other two are?
She's covered plat du jour  and table d'hote.
A la carte 's er  wide choice of  choice of food.
Has to wait for food to be cooked and prepare to wait for it.
Okay.
Did anyone get er er an example of an a la carte?
Yeah.
Right!
Okay.
Hold on to those.
I want you share those with the group shortly.
And the other one is  please?
Okay.
And what exactly's that?
What am I gonna get for my money for that?
Erm 
 

Continental.
It is continental.
What do I actually get?
What is the  way?
Oh accommodation.
Accommodation, right!
Can you just check that we took down the following.
I think that we actually just had time to talk through these and you didn't actually make notes.
We did!
Yeah we did!
You've actually taken notes?
Yeah.
And you did that?
Yeah.
Right!
Wonderful!
I was just a little curious and she seemed to be er
Oblivious to !
.
And you actually took that down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right!
Wonderful!
Okay then!
Continuing  with the menu and  when planning a menu the points to be taken into consideration are  David!
David .
Okay?
What things do you think you need to consider then  when you're putting together a menu?
They like a lot of food that's popular.
Popular food.
Mm.
Good!
Choice.
Appearance and choice.
Nutrition
Baked potato.
Alright!
Just one at a time!
Nutrition.
No, time.
Go good balance.
Who said balance?
Me.
Okay.
Balance in what way?
Well   I mean, well that's it, you know  selection of everything like the starch foods
Is that balance or variety 
plenty of  
Variety.
Don't know.
Okay.
Oh
But you need a balance as well, like protein and  
If I put there  balance.
Yes, you're quite right!
What else do you need to consider?
Something that's very important  that you need consider.
Type of customer .
Well done!
You actually need to consider  this person  because, if you haven't got that person  i.e. customer  there's little point in having a menu  unless you're going to sit and read it yourself!
Okay?
So you need to consider that very carefully.
So  first things first then  the people for whom the meal is intended.
And it can determine certain things  Right!
Type of food to be served  and type  and the number of covers.
Why do we need to consider the type of food to be served?
So people  they always keep, the customers that always arrive  if you're in a restaurant.
You never know 
Yes.
what type of .
Can I have a look at those menus that some of you brought in did i , cos we've got some with a la carte did anybody get sort of erm  a pub grub menu or  No, you all went for the  top of the range.
Who's got the menu  
I've got a Beefeater one.
Right!
Where's the  have one?
Who had that copy er, a la carte?
That's fine I'll give it you back I won't er  I won't take it away from you!
Martin!
Who had the  a la carte?
That was from .
And that was a la carte?
Right!
You hold on to that and you and you can, sort of talk it through.
With that, hold on to that.
Right!
Can you give us the prices of, have they got prices?
A la carte?
That's right!
Are you listening?
A la carte then?
Just give me a .
In the erm  the starters, melon in  four ninety five  avocado pear is five forty five  frog's legs, ten ninety five  and, that's the most expensive starter.
Right.
Erm, yep!
And then it's  soups starting at three forty five, five forty five  and then it's on to main course.
Fish, twelve  salmon is twelve ninety five  Dover sole is twenty two ninety five.
Okay, you can stop there, that's lovely thank you!
Right!
At Pizzaland we can have starter for  one pound thirty if we want!
And, we can have  a main for  seven pound fifty- ish.
Can you see the  the range of price, but also  obviously pizzas  and command a lower  price  than things on an a la carte menu.
Oh right, this is a fixed one.
Good!
We'll use that in a moment.
Now  so the type of food that you offer  will reflect the type of establishment.
You wouldn't really expect to get  a la carte style food  in a pizza  establishment.
Okay?
What about the time, where do I put the time?
Bearing in mind this is in relation to customers.
Time of day it is.
Yes, the time of day  will depend of menu that you offer but  what else will it consider?
Time of year.
Time of year.
Food that is sort of 
Pardon?
Things that are in season.
Yes it will.
But think of your customer.
The time people go out to eat.
The time people go out to eat.
The time people will go out to eat.
If you were going for a MacDonalds how long do you think it would take?
Half an hour.
Depends how much you eat, but assuming
Alright, depends how much you eat.
A Big Mac, some fries and a coke.
About half an hour.
Half an hour.
Half an hour at the most  
Depends if your  
Right!
Half an hour at the most.
If I went and had  a meal in the evening  a la carte, how would you  envisage it would take to go through that?
An hour and a half.
About  
I it it virtually, you're virtually going to use the evening.
Number of covers.
Depends how many people you're erm  chef's actually cooked for at the time.
Yes.
Why would that reflect what you offer?
Cos
The time.
How long it will actually be.
How long the customer's actually sitting there for his meal.
That's right!
But also
How many.
How many it's for.
How many actual people in at any given time.
Tha that will reflect what you can actually offer.
Right!
All important  cost.
The amount of money that people are prepared to pay for the meal  plus the overheads and the establishment.
And I think we actually got that, somebody said price.
Mm.
David, a question to you!
You said popular food  did you not?
Mhm.
How, how would you find out what is  what food is popular?
Oh you gotta do it now?
Pardon?
Depending on the amount of people .
No.
So you're just going to compile a menu and you're gonna hope that  Joe public  likes what you've put on?
No, you can put .
Right.
So you sort of do a survey?
You do some research into it.
Yeah.
If you put  if you compiled your menu and you then found out that certain dishes weren't being sold  what would you do then?
Take them off.
Right.
Good!
Did I actually tell you last week about the feed back ?
Yeah.
Yes?
No.
It was the other group I mentioned.
What you've got, you've got your customer  we've got your menu  feedback  and you got your products.
Right, so  your customer  has the menus  you get some feedback, and  the feedback you might need to modify your product  which is really what David's just said.
The fact that you would need to change  your menu  if it wasn't  being used.
That's quite important that you're aware of that.
Season.
And I think se several people did say that.
Use foods in season because they're cheaper.
Hot weather  dishes not always suitable to serve in cold weather.
Although, this summer I don't think it would of had much of an effect.
Yes?
Can I leave ?
Yes certainly!
That okay?
Yeah.
Right!
I've also said that you need to consider the staff.
Why?
What type of restaurant it is.
When you're putting yo together your menu why do you need to consider the staff?
They can .
Yes!
Exactly that!
Whether or the , they've got the ability to cook what you've put on the menu.
It's absolutely crucial!
What else?
Serving.
Yes, whether they can actually, whether they've got the skills  to silver serve, if your menu requires that it's silver served  then, then, yes clearly you would need to consider that.
What else would I need to consider David?
Well I think when you have the customers then you know what type of things  once you've  down you get  type of people.
If it's a high class restaurant then you prefer to   people who know what they're doing.
That's right.
What else do I need to consider  along with the staff?
For the benefit of the staff also.
We've looked at whether or not the staff have the skills  to cook  and serve, what else do I need the staff to be able to do?
Who's worked in ki , sorry!
Explain all the dishes so that the customer has 
That's right!
Yes, they need to have product knowledge.
Who's been in  kitchen?
Who's done  production?
Yeah ah!
Right!
When you actually went into the kitchen  what type of things were in there?
The sink.
What else is in there?
Equipment.
Equipment!
Did you know how all of it works?
Did you use all of 
Not all of it.
it?
No.
No.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's something else that you need to be aware of.
It would be no good  putting together a menu that required  certain equipment to be used  and staff didn't have the ability to use it.
And that is a summary of that.
Another point there  size and equipment of kitchen and dining room.
It would be no good  putting together menu  and arranging to do two thousand covers if you've got  spacing for twenty persons, would it?
By the same token, if your equipment  is  small pieces of equipment  then you would not have the facility  to do a large volume of meals.
If you think of it in relationship to the size of your cooker at home  and the size of the convection  ovens in  the eighth floor kitchen  or in   they're much larger  and therefore you are more able to cook volume.
It's alright.
When I'm actually choosing the dishes that I'm going to put on the menu what things do we need to consider?
Er  special diets, like vegetarian or 
Er  yes, we would consider that.
What else wha might we consider?
You can take erm   of how much it's gonna cost.
buy in bulk.
Yes.
What things do I ?
And that's one we'd look for in se , in season.
But there's something else.
We'll eat with our mouths but we also eat with what else
Eyes.
Our eyes.
Our eyes, yes.
So what  do we have to think of when we actually compile a menu?
Pardon?
Colour.
Yes we do.
The colours.
The colour.
You need this information to do your exercise that you're going to do for me  shortly.
So, do not repeat the main ingredients.
Avoid food the same colour.
It actually gives you an example there.
And think about the textures of food.
Over here.
Is that better?
Can you see now?
Yes.
And  something that  you all mentioned  nutrition.
No.
It's alright.
If you were planning a menu  which would you consider first do you think?
Proteins 
Protein.
vitamins, carbohydrates?
When you're compiling a dish then?
What would you do?
Select chips and plan it round the chips?


No.
No.
You'd plan it around the main course  the main  the main meat.
Meat?
Why meat?
Suzanne?
Because  meat's the main  .
.
Gareth?
Which would you plan first?
If you're planning a dish, which would you  proteins, the vitamins, the carbohydrates.
Protein.
Protein?
I say vitamins first.
Vitamins, carbohydrates.
No!
All that meat's got a 
Pardon?
All that meat's got a lot of
Protein.
Yeah.
Yeah protein.
Protein?
Protein.
Does anyone know why protein?
Yes?
Oops!
Steady!


Why protein?
Erm  it's the most beneficiary to the body.
Yes!
And also, you wouldn't want a piece of bro , broccoli!


No that's iron!
No,.
No, to me  piece of broccoli .
People do!


Yeah, but then it's
Yeah.
I if you've ever dieted  then you'll be aware that  you actually  reduce the carbohydrates, but you need to retain protein and vitamins.
Because those are essentials
Right.
for the  the good order of the body.
Basically.
And  therefore  when you're looking at the nutritional value  you need to be  very aware  of that.
Yes.
So you need to be aware of too many carbohydrates.
Plan your protein first, vitamins and minerals second, and then your carbohydrates.
Right, when you've completed that  you have a menu compilation exercise in front of you.
From the items in the list below prepare to luncheon menus.
One menu should be a four course table d'hote with two choices for each course  plus vegetables.
And the other should be a set six course menu for a business lunch .
You can't  actually repeat any of them  when, in your menu compilation.
There is adequate there in ar order to be able to do the exercise.
Now, based on the information that you've just taken down  you need to give thought to the way in which you compile those.
Off you go!
You can do it within twos  or threes.
That's not fives and sixes, that's twos or threes!
So David and Gareth and David and, I don't know your name .
Terry.
Terry.
Terry.
Right!
David, Terry and
You'll be all up, Kieran, Kieran you've got somebody behind you.
Two.
Two.
Daisy you can join up there.
Three.
Yes.
Group threes isn't it?
Group of three.
This group's three.
Yeah.
So you got to remem , you got to think of colour  texture  you can write all over the sheets if you want to.
As long as you use the ones on the sheet  and you come up with  the two selection menus.
Yes, put everything on it.
Make out a  from both?
Well you've got to make that , I'm going to tell you, you need to think about it.
There isn't a list   so that you will need to sort of think it through.
Are we not allowed to use the same things twice?
That's right.
Oh!
And so if you use the  whatever  what is it you wanted to use in yours?
Right  so have a look,.
It's actually quite helpful isn't it, to have
Yeah.
two or three, you can have a look at what they  the way in which they're put together which why I .
Right, well you , how you going to use it?
Well I'm not going to actually tell you because I'll  ruin the solution to this.
So, if I start to tell you 
you need to think it through.
Okay?
So, it's,i it's not going to be as I .
The things that you would get out .
Daisy!
That's better .
It'd be certain things you would have as starters and then .
How many, how many ?
Right!
Do you think I about the ?
Yes.
Well, have you got some ?
Oh you can't use, you can't use your
No you can't use anything twice.
No.
Can't use anything twice.
I ,yo i , I mean  if you use in one  .
Well, I shall be interested to see what you can get.
You've found a certain  Paul?
Yeah, but I mean .
Can we erm  does it have to be all on here or can we use ?
Sorry?
Can you copy that and just what's on there?
Can you put  to it?
No you can't!
Right!
No, we're not gonna take forever .
Can you put, add things?
No!
Copy it all down.
I haven't any .
There is a solution!
We can't use  the same things twice?
No, you can't use the same thing twice.
You can't use the same thing twice and coffee doesn't count as a course!
Just put it  you you'll need to get that  so what's the problem?
Well then it'll be a course on it's own.
Impossible!
You've gotta get  haven't you?
You've got to think about it!
Cheese and biscuits ?
Cheese and biscuits can be a course.
Could we have, er ?
Can you?
You tell me!
Yeah.
And don't forget you're thinking of colour  texture
So you've got set menu and you've got table d'hote menu.
Right!
Well that's got a starter and it's 
How you doing?
Just the starter now cos she's .
Let's see.
What's it called?
Erm  .
Pardon?
Please worry about listing them.
Right.
than one, two, three, four, five, six.
Take a look at those.
Well  your table d'hote.
That's not the choice is it?
It, it actually says to you  two choices for each course.
Read the instructions!
Yes Colin!
You had a six  on table d'hote, you've got give me three choices.
As you long as ?
Yes you can.
Do you have to use all the vegetables?
I think you'll probably be able to.
Yes.
Bearing in mind you're looking for colour and .
It's possible to use  all the items.
Keep in mind  one quarter.
You got it?
I'm glad there's !
Right!
Did you all manage to complete it?
Yeah.
Right!
I want you to bring it in it's completed state to next week's lesson please?
So, whoever you're working with  Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Whoever you're working with  you need, as a pair or a three-some to bring the solution with you next week please?
Also, Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Also you will need to bring menus with you next week  for comparison.
Right!
If there's anyone in your group that suddenly reappears  they need to see Sally  for their  assignments.
