Okay, if you'd like to push on.
Just for those of you who have just arrived , we're actually recording this session as part of a  a large spoken database which is gonna be part of a national archive  and so you're being recorded for posterity.
We've got a translator for Roger  so they will be able to understand him.
 
.
Okay?
So that you're gonna  database then.
Erm right!
Er Martin  see , sends his apologies I'll be actually chairing the meeting for him.
Erm so  so if you'd like to  kick off.
What I'd like to do is go through the minutes of the last meeting.
First, for a matter of record  and each other accurate, accurately recollect  oh we're actually taping this.
So if anybody would like to shout out if there's not  an accurate  well if somebody actually listened to it.
Onto page one  page two  page three  page four  and five.
So we all agree that's a  accurate, vaguely accurate reflection of what happened?
Okay.
I'd like to go back to the minutes in terms of matters arising which don't arise under the  the agenda items.
On page one I think that we will record the .
Mm!
On page two I think the first thing was, was the erm  results of the air conditioning on   Wellesey House is still omitted.
Yes.
Yeah, I'm  
Still be waiting on them?
Well  we've, we've had interim  or final interim reports  and wishing now that Whiskers  are actually gonna look at Dixons for me.
Mhm.
but erm  we're nearly there.
Okay.
Put against the letters that I wrote they've all been sent out.
I've actually got thirty one copies of  at the moment.
But it's interesting to know that a lot of the copies  either  must have copies, which they should have  or that they know what  bin it.
It should be a long drawn out process.
And I'm sure you'll find a way Steve.
Very long, drawn out process.
Mhm.
With regard to any regulations on fire precautions  erm  department  well the government is sitting on those, it's unlikely they will be out much before January of next year.
As soon as I get a draft I'll I'll  let you know  what the  perfections are.
Okay fine.
Now, V D U and eye tests I'll take over the main primary agenda.
Just to give you an update of price.
My next comment about erm  concerning  it's getting  saving tables and the like  we've actually  er agreed accommodation schedule for this year  and that's following fro from some changes in Customer Services o , in July.
So, er  to programme a new network.
In terms of review of staggered hours  erm  the review is sort of a constant one which has not really come to head yet, in terms of actually being able to write something down, so I'm we'll be able to  as soon as we, as soon I've something which we  erm, come to any conclusions in terms of staggered hours.
The, one about the security guard, Bill   he, he's now made arrangements for  the attendance  a first aid  er, meetings.
Mm.
That is, in actual fact, a bit difficult for 
Mm.
at the moment, you can appreciate 
Mm, mm mm.
cos if he  he's on a twelve hour shift  and, those meetings tend to  be  have been around the same sort of time, then obviously, what we've gotta be careful about is, adding any more hours
Mm.
onto what he's already  taken on here.
So that's, what we've got to understand is that .
Mm.
I think obviously, need to be making an appearance now than
Yep.
Mm.
Suzanne you  you're reporting Martin ?
Yes.
Back in the index of bulletins.
Erm
Erm, Paula 
Paula 
Twenty four.
Yeah, erm  she's nearly finished it, Paula, and  and it will be issued shortly  that.
Mm.
Okay, it goes onto the main primary agenda for most of the time.
Moving onto safety, am I right?
Yes.
Mm.
We did at erm  we've actually erm  sorted the issue abo , out about erm  gritting the car park.
It erm  security are actually carrying it out and clearing the best positions  to, to do so.
Right.
Then, er overnight.
They've also issued to me the appropriate  er protective equipment as well and so that er  they don't  you know, so I'll assume that is on the way.
Good!
And we've al , we've also
Sorry!
Sorry carry on.
and also erm  spoken to the police in relation to emergency evacuation in the back.
The police have sor , have got a copy of our emergency evacuation procedures, at the moment we're waiting for them  to return it to us.
Once they've done that then  we shall take the appropriate action needed.
Right!
Erm, if there's anything else?
Well there's the,?
Yeah.
Right.
John, did you get any reply from the police on that?
Well , yeah, I spoke to them like, on the telephone, erm  and  basically they er  and we agreed that we wouldn't take it any further  so  it er  happened to be a police officer's view  as against our view, and whilst we didn't agree with the view, er  we sent enough references to make our point known anyway.
So you can take it up with the, the er  do whatever he felt necessary, but we left it at that.
Erm, I mean the point the police have made has been addressed,
Right.
but the reasons why have er
Okay.
I'd like permission.
Mm.
I think that's supposed to mean  something, I dunno !
Yes, it's  yeah,.
Well the next point is between Roger and  John, I didn't understand at all so could you
Good!!
I think someone's already  John!
Maybe you'll like this one?
At erm  that's  that big lighting is there  on the basis that if the switch goes down we should have a number of telephones that still have to be available  erm and  we need to identify them  suggested by a red telephone, or using a red telephone situated somewhere.
Er, and the issue was yes, we need some  for emergency use  and erm  we will also need proba , probably need some for business use.
I  have spoken Joe , and I sent a memo to  a copy to Martin  er, suggesting where these should be placed and how they should be dealt with.
And er  we're now sort of waiting  to get serious enough.
Yeah.
Mm.
Okay, so  have gone down there to  emphasize the importance of accidents.
Erm, I'll take down the other, the main agenda cos we've  we've sort of set up a special group for the  .
And the next point  on the  on the number of things that are being reported in  the accident books.
Erm  I've in fact, become a bit of a artist on, on  accident book, and between the nineteen of June ninety two  and sixteen and September, er December rather  there were twenty two  complaints logged about sickness, diarrhoea, sore throat, sore , and headaches, from the first floor  erm, of which  twenty of these complaints were from females, and two were from males.
And it is er
It's not very popular !
Indeed not!
Let's hear this out.
Merely presenting it in er  as analysis.
I actually dissuaded er
 
What's the proportion of females on that floor?
Er, good question !
Actually noticed, with an inkling of  as well.
So er  she was the one who pointed that fact to me.
I wouldn't have worked it out, so  erm
Stop digging will you !
There haven't been any other erm  any other areas  er, of complaint with er
Mm.
i er in tha , in that  on the second or third floors  but I did, in fact, look at the first, second and third floors to get a comparison.
Erm, the conditions were  erm  slightly different on the second floor, in the sense that  there were a few, few people and a few items of equipment  erm, and there is a relatively great density of staff on the first floor  than I would have found .
But, if we then, we then considered  non air conditioning explanations  erm  which, I don't want to go into but  there's all sorts of  text that one could  mention.
But  if we look at the air conditioning explanations  we  we reckon that the conditions likely to lead to sickness  and, and the related illnesses that were mentioned  er  was, the low humidity  that  that we thought might er, be in the area  erm, because it dries out the  and enables viruses  to enter the body more  more easily.
And the, the other one  was  the  potentially reduce ventilation  because, erm, the the insufficient air supply, air flow within that area means that  the airborne viruses aren't getting shifted fast enough.
And, we also face with a  a certain stance there where  if people  blame, er, turn round to us and say  there's a draft here  because er, the air conditioning's working they don't wanna sit in a draft.
We have, in the past, switched the air conditioning down  which reduces the ventilation which means  creates, makes the situation worse.
Erm, there's 
 
there's two elements in relation to the air conditioning itself, er  spreading viruses, and we  take two preventative actions  one of which is that we spray all the air conditioning ducts work quarterly  with, what's known, as a virucide and  I relate that to the equivalent of sticking a  a toilet block in the toilet, it kills all  all known airborne germs sort of thing.
 
And the other thing is, is that all the air  that  is within the building is directly supplied from outside the building  and is then extracted  extracted to the exterior of the building.
We don't actually recirculate the air within the building, so there's no business of  people on the second floor giving germs to people on the first floor, and then people  giving germs to people on the ground floor.
So, those are the actions that we actually take with the air conditioning itself.
Erm
Can I just so , can I still 
the 
pick them up?
Sorry!
Yeah, sorry!
I was looking at actions 
Yeah.
next 
Yeah.
but if you've got any questions on that front?
Mm.
A, just a question of whether the  sorry, you've done all these statistics, whether actually the first floor was, seemed to be a problem?
Statistically.
Well  ah, that's one of the things I'm leading to.
Mm.
This was, this was, if you like  a record of the eye approach, we went round, we felt the air and  erm, er made judgement, in the same that people like to be making judgements
Mm.
about how stuffy it is, and the like  when we agreed that is was  erm  not as good as it could be, may I just say  erm, but we haven't got any, if you like,er statistical measurement, and one of the actual points that were starting to do now  is we're actually going to start reporting tu , temperature and humidity on the first, second, and third floors within G P House.
And we're gonna start publishing that information.
In actual fact,
Can I just ask why you're ignoring us lot on the ground floor?
Why?
Well you've 
I mean 
got the doors open  presumably!
I don't know why you're getting so !
Because, I'm responding directly to  accident  books, and similar conditions.
Ah, I see!
And the conditions on the ground floor are somewhat different.
Cos it's mainly men on the ground floor they don't 
I see, yes!
complain you see!
I think I've been sadistically grouped!
Erm
But er
but erm  anyway  I've forgotten what I was saying now.
I be , so one of the things we're gonna do is publish that information on a regular basis.
Erm  and we have in fact, done some tests on the first and second floor since  we did this  eye test  and  er, humidity is in fact, within the  the er  the Health and Safety legislation, it's within tolerance.
Presumably the temperatures are too.
But, one of things that we are discovering is that when people complain about drafts  er, we've been switching the air conditioning up and down to balance it up to suit the individuals needs.
What we may have to do is actually balance the air conditioning's needs up  to suit  the building, if you like, rather than individuals concerned, and then we'll have to address the individuals concerns the same, in terms of moving the desk, or moving the person  if they're in a draft.
Erm, and we also need obviously, to educate people there.
The consequences of them wanting the drafts to be turned down.
Because, if we don't actually ventilate the building  then, we're not actually gonna solve the problem .
Mhm.
And we're gonna get hot spots and cold spots.
Fine.
In terms of your research on the  the action book itself, or th , or the reports or whatever  you said, sorry, there's nineteen on the first floor you say?
I gave you a copy of the notes actually, Mark.
No , no you said at the start of this .
There's erm  there's twenty  beg your pardon, there's twenty two complaints
Right.
that we had in a six month period.
Yeah.
of which  er er, that was to do with sickness, diarrhoea, sore throats, sore  
 
dizziness, headaches
Right.
which could be air conditioning related.
Right!
We don't know whether they're on, they're on the first, second or third?
That's just the first floor.
They were all on the first floor Mark.
No complaints on the second floor, or the third floor, or the ground floor.
What?
Well that's fairly sig titi fa , significant innit?
One of the four floors has a got a problem.
Yeah.
Roger, wasn't I  correct in thinking that Paula was also going to look at  erm  not just accident reports, other sickness for the area, to actually 
Yeah I I did look at it from  from  from after Christmas and there have been no complaints at all, in the accident book  up until the eighteenth of March  that were of that nature.
There was a 
Mm mm.
exact  
Ten of that eleven people in the last two weeks, sort of, complaining about but they don't always  let me know so that I can document it, that's the problem.
Yeah.
Where is that, still on the fou , first floor?
Oh yeah.
So
Mainly in F two and F three rooms.
It's now, like the stomach cramp rather than 
Mm.
and  it's not people that have eaten, not   certainly not the restaurant , what should I say 
It's the food,the food!
but they're not actually, having been to lunch and 
Yeah.
I know, for a fact, one person us , never uses canteen at
One?
Well it's, yeah 
One.
I mean the problem is, I mean, that the significance of the com , the sort of the numbers of those are still particularly low
Mm.
and trying to  one was  one would assume, that to a certain extent, if you've got a problem with air conditioning that we would  we would have a higher, a higher incidence  of erm  of those sort of complaints.
Mm.
And we don't.
No, what I'm saying is, I don't think from the accident book you're getting a true picture because people don't always report it, they'll be off several days afterwards.
Right.
Just don't compla , I just wondered whether that was actually 
Ah , yeah, again
But the information we 
all 
do have does amount to something.
And something 
Well it's something that we're prepared to actually act on here is 
Yeah.
erm, the thing about it is  is that  I mean, one of  we we've at the minute we've been faced with  with some individuals  reckoning that they have er  rashes forming  around the face  er  in a number of areas  and there's  an indication that, and it's nothing more than that, that it could actually be to do with the laser printers and people sitting near them  in the light.
People suffering from dry skin, but it's the only wo , odd one case or another that actually reported, but it  we don't know how widespread these things are.
We've had  Wintams in   
But they're actually, they actually 
last week.
made out a thermal comfort test  on G P House  over the last few days  er, and we're now awaiting their results.
And that's really to look at, the sort of the, the dry skin  issues and so on?
I think the thing we've gotta be careful about, is also trying to er  i if we  ask everybody put all their analysis as such, we could start thinking  panicking or whatever
Mhm.
for all the wrong reasons, so we're trying to sort of pick a number of tests which will determine whether there's a problem with air conditioning and it's humidity or  or er  or if the temperature.
And if we can pin those down, and as Roger said, we've also now, over the last few weeks co begun carrying out erm  regular testing two or three times a day now on each of the floors and looking at the humidity 
Mm.
in there.
And we've gotta,wha what we'll do we'll get those set up at the  sort of  the appropriate working temperatures, and working humidity and then we will have to deal with people on an individual basis, if basically, they're uncomfortable because of draft or whatever it might be.
I think that's what we're aiming to do now, get things set up as a standard  er, operating  erm, levels, having done that  then we begin 
Mm.
to isolate them.
Oh sure!
As I say I'm    I'm not convinced that it's air conditioning  erm, but then again  there's more detail, more data that's required.
Next twenty,.
Mm.
I mean, if they want,.
So essentially, what you're saying is we've got the erm  the sort of environmental checks in  place, to help 
Yes indeed!
track down,ho , home 
Yeah.
home in on the  
Yes.
But it will take time.
Eventually.
And I've done myself a  on that reckoning, because until we've got that sorted anyway.
 Wintams actually  er quarterly check the air  within G P House, and the water within G P House.
Mm.
And erm  to that extent  we can respond very rapidly if  those results aren't within the, the limits  defined.
And we've never had  any problems in that area at all, so, to that extent.
We are taking, if you like, all preventative medsi , medicine we need to take  and  always difficult to in fact, to pin these things down.
Mm.
Is there any er, other things anybody wants to  ah John, did you want?
No.
What I was gonna suggest is that, we actually put something in the bulletin, not in the sense of, well, you know  please report your illnesses kind of thing, but  if we just make people aware of actually this sort of environmental control thing would be a good idea.
Yeah, I think that's a fair comment.
And the  and the measures that we're here, that's a good idea actually!
Been my major struggle for a long time now.
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm!
Mostly definite the restaurant.
What have I done !
Not bad!
We would do it!
Okay, move  on to first aid.
Do we know whether we have the updated
Yes we have.
We have.
On the erm  there won't be the first aid room over the   we're looking to move that to the first floor.
Oh I'm sorry!
Can you speak up then?
Oh sorry!
Have I   
Mm mm.
Have they liaised with you?
Not yet, no.
Ha!
That's alright then !
I gave the list to  Martin   at the last meeting.
And attendance is much better cos I think  the message is finally getting across now.
Sorry!
Can you  er mm.
Yeah , just saying that when we move the erm  the first aid room to the, to the first floor  from  House.
That's a definite is it?
Erm, yes.
I erm  as much as anything else so that we don't block a fire exit on the gro , on, in the basement.
Mm.
Mm.
Have you seen the timetable for that.
Er no, not yet.
I'm sure you'll tell us er
Yeah.
Okay, fire?
Mm.
Involving the fire, the exit th there, we actually talked about  er, issuing a memo to all the branches  and telling them there ought not be electrical equipment on overnight.
Mhm.
I counted something like   and at the moment it appertains just to the telephone system and regard to the enquiry system.
And  but, very shortly the branches are gonna be  getting some more appropriate , and it's gonna be a lot more that needs to be se sort of kept on overnight.
Mm.
But it might be more appropriate to wait until  nearer the time to send a memo, I don't know.
Erm  on the audit side both Karen and I have been round to all the branches in order to deal with our old equipment.
Erm  on October ninety four I'll be, guess there won't be any old prices in the .
You've been round to all the branches?
Yeah.
It's  on, on a different project but we were 
Mm.
incorporating that on the way round.
With regard to leaving  electrical equipment on overnight, Mark, erm  once or twice  be nice if you already be bought it to my attention that people are leaving things on  erm, now, when we've had this discussion that most of these  items are safe.
But erm  I th they are worried  certainly, one or two of them are worried, but er  some of this equipment is left on, and left on unnecessarily  and we ought to be encouraging people to switch off what isn't
That's right.
doesn't have to be left on overnight.
Erm, sort of a general memo about the, just er literally  good housekeeping if nothing else.
If you're not using the equipment  or you don't need to use the equipment overnight then please turn it off.
Mm.
Er
Presumably you get some  card license installed, so  mind you, you'd  the outcome!
Erm, yes I think, I think, you know, immediately you're thinking of doing it the branches and obviously you're running po , pretty big  in 
Mm.
the way I see it, anyway, you know, if there are  things that are meant to be left on .
Er, as far the  these building are concerned  I think your point is valid, I mean, I think probably printers, I think that you suggest are left on  because you never know when it'll be  to.
Er, only got one persons  
Assume the responsibility?
But, other than that, yeah  I think you're right.
Presumably with an arrow, you have to Mark, Mark.
I think there are some things Mark that have to be left on
Mm.
as an necessity there  for all these  working overnight.
But those that aren't  erm  should be switched off and whether there's a way 
Mm.
of sort of having some kind  
Perhaps I'll , perhaps I'll liaise with Chris 
Yeah.
through his team and see how it, see if there's 
Yeah.
anything
you also probably need to liaise with erm  probably with Mike  
Yeah.
and you know, find out what they're doing, but  general .
I've gotta liaise with the information centre in  the computer centre tomorrow  see if there's any guidelines we could probably use.
There may be some kind of notice on them that says, you know, these machines should not be switched and then everything would be switched off.
Mhm.
If they came round 
Mm.
I mean, that's the sort of thing.
It's
Yeah, our ones' actually got something on, especially one of the machines it's got little spots across the screen saying do not .
Do not switch off.
Switch off.
Yeah!
But I mean 
Yeah.
so they wouldn't switch it off.
But are others  
Still, still switch off!
Oh do they?
But they're very !
Okay, fine!
Okay.
Onto any other business.
Ah sorry!
Have you  done the, done the agenda?
Mm.
Finished that.
I think Pa Paula on the  's information.
Er  she said it was done.
And she did check, and we weren't telling them, no we did?
Mm.
Do you think it's a representative coming to this meeting rather than just simply
think they actually go off site 
the information?
in places like 
I presume , I presume 
 
that they, they'd be the only one.
Oh right!
Yes.
The th 
Ye Yep!
The collapsing chair
is erm  is a mystery!
And it's not just a mystery to me, but a mystery to the individual I spoke to.
Er  the chair being the offender, given the chair that collapsed underneath her  er, she couldn't, or she couldn't  explain to me how the chair managed to collapse underneath her!
So, I'm afraid I wasn't able to do a great to do a great deal more on that.
The only thing I would say is, is that  we're looking to  er start in the next quarter  various plans for  maintenance routines  one of which will be o , actually on furniture.
Er, there's a number of issues that will start cropping up with furniture fairly soon.
And, it's things like that I ne , hope and anticipate that we can actually .
I can only guess that  for erm  some reason  the bolts on the back of the chair fell off, or came lose  and when she sat on it  she leaned on the back, in an unusual position  and fell through!
Mm mm.
Mhm.
Okay.
Let's go onto COSHE regulations.
We've had a meeting on COSHE and we've sort of put the erm  the  revisions of COSHE into, into action.
Basically this is updating the original COSHE, COSHE re register.
And Katie is the only one that sent a reply back!
That's very prompt of you Katie!
Gold star!
Okay, point taken!
I don't think the date was due actually was, wasn't it?
No, it's not yet.
It's erm, the week
Yeah.
of  let's look in my diary.
If ever that's forgotten, once that's done, again it will be erm  the up-to-date part of the  COSHE.
And the fire and train records, I'm not sure where .
Well, the meeting that we're doing, all branch
Mm.
probably
Mm.
.
And I'll take that  management one.
No , er dust mites?
Yeah, er can I go back to this point before 
Mm mm.
about erm    I've actually got some  some cleansing wipes for, for 
Mhm.
I was actually going to  give to you Sue, so that you could test them but I understand you've already got some new ones?
Yeah.
You're talking about to send some aren't you?
Yeah.
I'll, I'll drop that off with you today  later on.
Fine.
What exactly is the intention  i in the  ?
Well, we'll see how much instigated first.
Are they not in
Cos they won't be used to just 
cleaning telephones up like that one!
Foot and mouth !
Well how many joint telephones are there?
Sorry?
How many joint telephones can you have?
There seem to be a number in Client Services.
Yeah.
Mm.
In some teams there's 
It's obviously 
about four 
Oh!
people share a phone.
Yeah.
Mm.
 
 
Sorry?
That's what I used to do with them!
Yes.
Now that you've gone.
Well
I'll talk to Sue about that one!
Right, Sue's gonna have two goes next time.
Still haven't told me what I've gotta do with them!
We could try it on our floor couldn't we?
Yeah.
See how we get on.
Mm.
What exactly are you trying?
That the people complaining they so sore throats, sickness and diarrhoea!
That's exactly what  been the problem down there.
Oh!
Oh it's good money  
 
telephones!
You can go and have a look.
Especially where those people are passing the germs down the telephone!
It's a good idea, but I don't  really see what you're actually sort of measuring.
Have been 
Well I wasn't here, so I won't take any of the blame for this at all!
It's a really good job whether yo sa sa say so or not!
It could be sort of spread throughout the company.
May maybe a hygiene requirement  ?
What, sickness and diarrhoea?
It's to provide, to provide people with the opportunity use the wipes if they require as a safety precaution.
Oh we'll sort it out anyway, Sue shall we?
Right!
On the dust mites
On the dust mites, yeah.
Erm  the cleaning of the carpets on the first and second floors erm  they obviously  fumigate them  erm, but we don't  do the dry clean like we do the  carpets over here.
Er, what we'll do is spray the carpets  erm  quarterly.
Erm  one of the problems that we've been facing in the past, certainly, in G P House is the amount of stuff that's on the floor  and therefore we haven't actually been able to tackle these things  very effectively.
Erm  but one of the things that I am doing is over the next quarter  with, various people  begin to review the cleaning schedules of what they actually do, whether we  clean them on a  on a more frequent basis  rather than just responding that particular area.
Get in the dust busters couldn't you for this one!
There's actually another complaint this morning I've had on  the first floor of G P House.
It's only the second offence according to the last 
What's wrong with this first floor?
I mean when they gonna 
It's my wing as well!
Erm
Militants in there!
so I'll be coming to see you.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
Okay.
If we move on to the main agenda.
For the sake of this .
Oh!
Erm, as I mentioned with the  group visitors  we've started up a branch action group fo specifically focused on the sort of branch issues.
Aren't we just leaving that till last?
This is basically to ensure that the, the branches are  complying er to legislations.
Er, we're looking at, to whether  the branch and the manager, sort of be  take a more active role including the  the branch sector.
Because at the moment there's no one looking at  health and safety on day to day basis and  in any of the branches.
There's just point if anyone, someone from head office goes in.
Mm.
And what this actually came out on was this overall health and safety assessment that we've been doing for G P  erm, we've actually just filed that  overall group focused on the  the branches as a potential issue  and I know it's been very su su successful on a number of times.
What we try do and is actually sort of focus in on the branches so that so, to try and get try and get all the strains together.
What are the issues are we dealing with ?
And we've had one meeting be , between, just really detailed some of the, some of the issues that we find  and focus on them a bit more.
Mm.
Erm mm, the other thing I was gonna mention which is, which we've sort of really gone through is the air conditioning and that we're actually sort o , we are doing  the monitoring of the environment and all, and have had Wi 
 Wintams in  erm doing special exercises for us.
Er, I think we should look for  through in the terms of the bulletin.
The only thing for me is really just to bring you up-to-date in terms of the V D U project and where we are with that.
Erm  so, if you remember this is the reassessment of work stations.
Erm,the particular one I'm focusing on here is sort of the, the vision screening part of it cos the assessment of work stations is gonna be a longer term thing, we're going back to pre where they've actually sort of ticked the various boxes on the sheets  and said this is like that and so we are collating that information currently.
But, in terms of the  the actual vision screening itself  erm, we've iden , those people who've been identified as V D U, V D U users'  we've had about five hundred and fifty replies to that,from the V D U, V D U, users'.
Erm, of that five hundred and fifty approximately four hundred have requested eye tests  or vision screen tests, sorry!
Erm, we've, we've had about approximately seventy tests take so , taken  place so far.
I don't know an anybody's in this group's  partaking in this?
But it's basically down on the  down on the first floor, we've set aside a  a room which  erm  the people from the Occupational Health Centre  here in Harlow, come up  and do vision screening for us on a regular basis they come  when do they come?
Once a week or
Erm, it's once a week, but I think they're coming in  the they're here twice this week  er, and I think, it's as and when they can, so if it's more than once a week then they will be here.
Yep.
Erm,right!
So, of the er, er yeah, of the people who were identified as being users', V D U users' we've had about eight percent of the replies have actually been returned, so we are chasing some.
Mm.
Some outstanding ones.
Yo , for your own information, as th , say health and safety group, in terms of people who ha , who undertake vision screening and then get referred on from a, for a full  full eye tests  it's usually around
Mm.
between sort of two and four percent tend to get referred on.
Erm, and we have had , I think about four or five people who are currently being referred on
Mhm.
er, in terms of eye tests.
And what happens to them, again, through the Occupational Health Centre,th they arra arrange for an optician to give them a full, full eye test  and then we get a report back on that situation.
I've, certainly had no a ,excuse me, no adverse comments back in terms  the vision screening etcetera, itself as er, people have sort of responded to it  seems to have had a  so something which will be quite good  sort of go going along in the right spirit.
Have you any feedback anyone  at all?
Have you 
 
?
No, not yet.
Mm.
a report from  vision screening.
Okay.
Though it not be  for a safety to anybody else in terms of operations, I think  .
I had erm  those, well it's actually been reported in the accident book, erm  a girl tripped, and Ted, Mick, John, and  Roger 
Ah yes!
Yes!
are aware of this.
Erm, the wires have clipped up now.
She fell and hit her head, or something.
Erm, you say that they're going to tidied in July,thi this year
Erm, yes.
when the moves take place?
Not all of them, no!
.
depends when it happens, I mean  we we're still waiting to find out where some of the changes, erm  in terms of layouts and the like are gonna be done.
Erm, but following on from that, wherever we  change layouts now we try and be very specific about  organizing the cable management up front and, so that they don't present any hassles.
Erm, in the Customer Services area  once we've seen what changes Customer Service wish to make  during this year that they  myself and Roger and gonna find that out, hopefully, tomorrow, erm, then we'll  be more specific about the areas that we have to address on th , the first and second floor.
We could, that's  one of our biggest areas 
 
anyway  erm  and if P D  er, remains a problem, or isn't gonna be addressed as far as the changes 
I've been told since , I was told yesterday 
then 
that they wouldn't be  it's 
in which case then we'll address 
Mm.
that  erm
before  the other moves take place.
I , cos I know our people, and Ted have  are reluctant, they think it's a danger to  sit there, the wires are coming down already!
Erm
Th , this is the cable wires is it?
Mm.
Er 
Oh!
Yes it is.
Erm , the cables?
I, I can't comment specifically to that.
Er, we'll have to take that as it goes.
Se I send somebody up there and they cou , you know, put them up as best they could.
Erm  cabling is a problem  on most of the first floor
Mm.
because it's  the one area of G P House where there is a co wide scale movements take place.
Mm.
But there is.
But you said , when we do a move, we do try to , you know, where we can
Mm.
by   and tidy the cabling as well.
And there was a memo to John from yourself, tenth of Jan , that my manager has passed to me, it said you'd given two options that you could go in on Saturday and  erm 
That's alright, I mean 
also that 
tha , that's, that's the activity that we're trying to sort of resume  erm 
That's the main 
erm 
thing.
but  that comes after  any moves that I'm making  because  clearly, they need somebody that can be
So do you know  what the price is going be?
sort of, to put it, I'm gonna be is that as from tomorrow we will have identified  what erm  desking and so on will be moved during the reorganization  erm, and obviously  any of the desking that isn't gonna be moved until the organization, we'll be tidying up the cables.
The others, and that maybe just a question of tying them up and 
Mhm.
making sure they're safe, even though they'll still be, sort of, visually  erm  they'll be seen, erm they'll be actually tidied on the desk.
But  er, the others, anything that isn't gonna be changed where the cabling is untidy, is dangerous, will have to picked up before that.
Right!
And that's the sort of thing that we will be identifying as from tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Then we'll be putting it back there, on exactly how and when  action ca can 
Oh, okay.
be addressed, hopefully.
Yeah.
It is, it is a problem, it's not necessarily 
 
something that can be addressed wi with a few cable ties, cos sometimes tying the cables together make a more of a  danger than 
Yeah.
leaving them loose.
Because, you know  like if people can get a foot caught round them, if they're individual they  they come out
Mm.
and sort of those, will get, people trip over.
Mm.
Okay.
Well clearly, we need to  you know, the long term moves which we you're obviously taking of in terms of the long running programmes is fine.
But, I think once you've decided to schedule it there's areas we still look at, and the managers are saying  this looks dangerous, then we have to .
Yes, in hand, yes it seems 
Mm, yes I think we've done that.
specific areas
That's actually been identified and that's, that's the route we're taking on.
Right!
What else?
Aha.
I see.
now, is it?
Erm, yes.
Any other safety?
We'll move onto the accident books, any things, or any issues that anybody's seen from the reports   action?
Erm, something came up yesterday  i in the catering unit  found out that erm  a first-aider in area, area hadn't actually been reporting all minor accidents, erm, and I think she felt perhaps they were a bit too minor to report.
Erm, I'm wondering maybe due to the small amount of incidents actually in accident book, whether this is  perhaps a general trend going on throughout?
I did speak to Paula yesterday, and she said she was gonna speak to you Suzanne
Mm.
about bringing it up in the next erm  meeting.
I was gonna say the same to you.
Yeah.
But erm 
Generally , I I  enter in the accident book if I give any treatment.
Erm  had she be giving treatment?
Yeah.
Should do, I think.
I think she felt wi , you know, some of them are sort of like, a bit unimportant.
She's now erm, aware of the situation.
Mm.
But erm  I was just concerned  you know, that
Mm.
perhaps it it might be going on
Mm.
Right, well I think 
elsewhere.
it's only  if you can reinforce it 
You know, there's that and then you can also 
within the  first-aiders and the, and obviously to try and  try and drive it to them on that  issue.
Well I did wanna follow this up with some other items 
 
of a person and need to write how important it was, the little ones in the accident book, but looking in the erm  erm  the handbook for the company it says that an accident form should be filled in  and 
Mm.
handed to the Office Services Manager, so, that's not the procedure we follow at the moment is it?
No.
Because I mean, I haven't seen an accident
No.
form.
No.
So it's, what is the procedure?
Is there a written procedure that says  if you deal with it then put it in the accident book?
Say, the first-aider's off sick
Mhm.
who's responsibility is it then?
Yeah, okay.
Well the procedure is anything, that's if there's an accident which  does require treatment from the first-aiders, I mean then  I think we should send it off  don't you?
So that means that
what we've had forms being filled in?
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean, in terms of the new issue of the handbook which is coming out in due course  , that's clarified
Oh right!
and  I think it was one of things which never really took off in terms of the accident 
Mm.
book.
Well 
What 
I was just looking for a reference 
 
for it, you know.
in terms of what should be reported and what shouldn't be?
Yeah.
Cos one of the things that I said, you know, just  when I was looking through the last  five or six months is that  it did seem  er, to be inconsistent in terms of certain areas like  the first floor, there's an awful lot of reporting going on  but, there was very little from the other, from the other areas.
Erm  I  I, I think the same is the case  was that, you know
Mm.
Is there one book per floor?
Is that how it was?
Is it one 
Okay.
book per floor, is that how it works or 
Just one book pe per first-aid room I think.
So we've just got one book in the whole building.
Is that right?
As far I know, yeah.
Yeah that's right.
That's a problem.
Maybe they can't find the book.
Yeah.
Well that's probably a good point actually really once you've only got a
And course, we have more accidents in the  kitchen !
Right!
No, no, I wasn't
I wasn't trying to !
Yes, but  !
Yes, there are!
Oh well, you might as well say that!
Yep?
I don't mind.
Okay, well let's perhaps look into that see whether.. there's a, a more appropriate way.
Cos I know  the principle used to be that is er, it was in the first aid room  cos that's where all the first aid treatments 
When you 
are based.
But then if there's no form 
 
to remind somebody they'll fill it in the accident 
Yeah.
book, then it's gonna get forgo , forgotten from one day to the next.
I think that's what happened with this particular person as well.
Because she's not been going to the first aid room.
She's not been going 
Yeah.
there.
So, she's writing them down, and then forgotten about them.
Yeah.
Okay, fine!
Well then look at that to see if there's a  more appropriate way of doing it.
Shall I speak to Paula about that then?
Yeah.
Paula, and perhaps we'll bring it up in a first aid .
Get that easily.
Well that was another thing, one of the new first-aiders we've got, erm  didn't know where the accident book was and I thought was quite an important thing that would probably have been brought up 
Yes.
at, at the initial training.
So
Who's that?
Debbie  .
Ah yes!
Okay.
You know what I mean, that is down to the individual really is that er  that they should actually find out  and i , that needs to be highlighted to all 
Mm.
of them.
Well if there's only one for each building then
Well perhaps when each new first-aider  qualifies they get like an induction pack or something.
Get a tour or 
Mm.
something !
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Are you intending approaching health and safety in  clients in the  Employee Handbook?
Er, yeah, and we're looking .
Right.
Is it gonna very released t to everyone?
Aha.
In due course.
Mm.
Mm.
The section on health and safety could be  could be quite large especially in the light of further installation.
Yeah, we've actually  er, way we've designed is that erm, it's actually a sort of  , it's inserted in the ham handbook itself as actually a, sort of separate removal section so they can
Aha.
use it sort of separately  .
Okay.
Well, in terms of the
Literally  I think the only I said is the thing we get from the branches.
Mm.
Well I think that
well needs a  I think one of the things we discussed in the branch action group meeting is actually, weren't quite sure what the  cos  we'd been sending out   for quite less than ten of the branches because  to  do something to them which was  mm  apparently lots of them in but erm  well they keep disappearing so that the  what we've been talking about is to try and get some points  erm  health and safety station  within the branch, which actually just has all this stuff for it.
At least everybody knows where to go and  it's all there an but obviously that has some difficulty in terms of where to locate it and where to .
That's something to look at  .
Okay.
In terms of actual accidents themselves, anybody  raising things or anything?
I did erm, mention, I think on one of them which was the erm  Tim , this is the upstairs, I did actually mention that when I saw it to  to Roger.
He was very heroic, but erm  you probably did address 
Yes.
that one.
Yeah.
Okay.
If there's nothing, apart from that  we can move onto  first aid.
Suzanne anything?
Not really, no
No.
this time.
Any other issues in terms of first aid, Mark ?
about first aid improving the
Right.
Are we  i in terms of the first, first-aider availability does that tend to work?
Okay, in terms of people are aware that they can their first ai , where they can get first aid and  don't tend to have any reports these days.
Well I think the erm  you said there was like a plan on each notice board with first-aiders and fire wardens on each floor
Mm.
but they look a bit out of date at the moment.
Mm.
They're constantly
Mm.
But certainly when we first went into first aid and we used to get regular calls in personnel all about, oh where's the first aid ?
But since it happened, in these days
No.
people seem to finding  the sort of first-aider.
I think we've got quite an extensive coverage now.
Okay.
Right, if we move onto fire.
Who's in charge of fire?
Jonathan!
What, you want one?
I've got nothing other,I don't know whether anybody's aware of what went on last Wednesday and probably that, I mean there could have been  there was a, sort of a, a cable that, a mains cable that heated up and started smoking  and er, we had to deal with that.
But erm, fortunately it didn't heat up, but we're looking at  erm, it didn't catch fire, but we're looking at er er, some safety features that we may actually have to install in the plant room  to erm  to actually identify these  these problems er, somewhat earlier.
It was just happened to be spotted by Richard , fortunately, whilst he was  erm, between jobs and actually being up a  steps, walked in a saw the smoke coming out of one of the er, main switch  areas.
At that stage he didn't seem to have any effect on anything in terms of erm, alerting  anybody, so erm  we need to er, we need to deal with that with more action than we ha have at the moment.
Mm.
Actually, I I think you're all aware of, that we caused some number of issues on that Wednesday afternoon  and for that half of our systems.
I suppose it erm  did widen so , the  the wider view on that  is at  that it is important that we carry out the possible appliance testing on a regular basis.
This, this could have led, led to a very nasty electrical fire!
Erm  and, to that extent, I'll reiterate, that we are in fact  working our way through  all of the 
 
the electrical equipment in the building  in terms of appliance testing and the like.
We're also, Mark, reviewing our preventative, our maintenance systems  erm, and we may , excuse me!
We may well  be extending the number of er  shut downs that we over the weekend so that we can carry out more extensive  maintenance on the electrical systems  around the organization.
Certainly bits that look pretty interesting  I should imagine  and a report on the end of the day with a number of er  proposals  and actions for er  hopefully, preventing this happening again.
 
Mm.
I think it just erm  also demonstrates our dependence on the  bigger systems in that regard.
Or we tend to 
Yes it does!
grind to a halt !
But not , but not as much as on the electrical systems.
Well no!
Mm.
I would think Mark knows that!
Yeah , I was  er   being naive and thinking of them, in the same capacity 
 
actually Norman, though I'm not  terribly  precise in my technical  technical .
Okay.
Good!
Any other 
On that point I've got
Yes.
quite a few, dare I start with 
Mhm.
them?
Erm
hiding them from !
Erm  apparently there was a training course held on the twenty eighth of Jan erm  the procedures were actually out of date at that time, and Mike on security?
Is he the head the  fire
The deputy.
Mike is, yeah.
the deputy , he's actually going to 
He's  
issue erm  the floor plans  erm  and procedures to everyone which  they still haven't received.
Erm
Will that be, will that   please?
I don't really know who yo to direct to  cos  do the fire marshals not meet regularly?
Only to try and  
Probably we should organize it.
I think they, no.
Yeah.
Erm  another thing on the erm  fire warden training it was stated the company did not want  erm, fire wardens to use the equipment  around the building, whereas the notices say  actually states, erm, attack fire if possible with appliances provided without taking personal risk.
Erm, but the training contradicted that and said that they  they showed them how they should be used, but, but they  shouldn't tackle a fire  and they 
Mhm.
wanted to know which
Mm.
they should be doing.
Mm.
Ya.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Like she says  I think the position is exes effectively what we're trying to reinforce is that we don't want any heros
Mm.
in a sense of  leaping into the flames and trying to battle with it.
Erm, but obviously if somebody can take some assertive action  that stops the fire  
Yeah.
down and that's a difficult  that's a judgement that  have to make.
And clearly, in terms of the fires as a particular  the rationale for them being there is to  
 
can get out of the building, which is why 
Mm.
the position of our doors  are attached to the system is the  fire exit's actually blocked, by fire  and that's their only exit at least you got some opportunity to  .
You was quite right.
You said I can do with some clarification which we  seek to do.
Erm
So, are the fire appliances only supposed to be used by the 
 
by the wardens then?
Mm.
Is that not sort of I mean, I wasn't aware that anybody wasn't  supposed to pick up a fire appliance  or not.
Again, it's a similar sort of issue which is  it's it is difficult to put across that  if you notice you haven't got a fire warden there and that's your only 
Right.
exit, then you use the fire
fire, fire extinguisher.
Though obviously one of the things that you worry about with fire extinguishers are you using the right one  with the correct 
Mm.
sort of fire?
Erm, you can cause as much, or more damage to yourself or equipment in ter , by using the wrong one.
Service is done   
Right, I mean the point I was making, I don't think there's anywhere 
 
where you have said positively don't use a fire extinguisher 
No it's 
in the event of bomb.
Mm.
I I think it would be crazy to actually say that positively.
I mean people  it is question of how you say you well enough that 
Aha.
people do understand that there ar ,if there's a problem and you can do something about it without being a hero, as Mark said  then something should be done.
Erm  but how you legislate for common sense and so on 
Mm.
I know that looking for a Purple Heart, or  V C, erm are   but I do believe it needs to be  it needs to be clarified.
Mm.
Okay, well I will se , I'll I'll seek to clarify tha to be able to join that to er sort of form of words.
Erm, something that was actually also raised before and after working hours, erm, there was a fire  evacuation, I think, in October  about to quarter nine
Mm.
erm
In G P House?
Yep.
which was, complete chaos apparently!
All rushing around 
Mm.
erm
That's happened.
what are the procedures then if fire wardens aren't there?
I mean, check it, as in  for checking buildings and  erm 
I didn't think it was chaos!
I thought it was quite well organized considering.
Apart from all the people didn't come out.
Half the, yes 
Did they not?
yes, that was the main thing!
 
The ones that I saw were.
Yeah.
Did the alarms  
!
Did the alarms actually keep ringing?
Actually organized it .
Yeah.
So they weren't switched off 
 
half way through?
Yeah?
They kept going?
Yes, they did, definitely.
For some time.
Right!
Yeah.
It's a good point there!
Develop a procedure for out of hours then.
And something  that was suggested by  fire wardens, that they could do a five or ten minute erm  presentation and could go round each floor  to make people aware that they are the  fire wardens, why we have to evacuate and the importance  erm 
Mm.
It's crafty  
and just issue memos
Mm.
which you can.
They've erm  volunteers to see if you can show this committee the presentation for the .
Aha.
Is it actually ?
Is that the sort of the general feeling towards 
Erm, Bevan 
fire?
and Mark, he said it was suggested, and it was a general feeling that that would be more
I haven't said that!
useful than issuing memos.
Oh yes!
That's er, true.
Gold star!
That's it.
Thank you.
Actually, that out of hours issue probably pertains to first aid treatment as well doesn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Perhaps we ought to make people aware that, just coming along security isn't .
Mm.
Yes.
Mm.
Erm 
Mm.
That's a good point!
I could  if I just pick up one other point about  you know, like the  the non-standard  times, or the non-standard occasions  when we do fire evacuations currently  er, I don't know where we think the fire is but we all troop out via our normal  fire exits and to our normal assembly ports  erm, it maybe  men , maybe an idea to  do  some fire evacuations where we  stayed where the fire actually was and people have got to take  other  other routes to evacuate the building.
Mhm.
Mm.
Yeah, I think we can probably try blocking exit next and see what happens!
And not on the  as well!
Well I'm a  da no, sorry!
I did get   and proved the place I've been going that actually more accidents due to blocking  and you sort of back up the stairs with you
Yeah.
yeah and create  accidents but erm  well perhaps we could do it in a sort of  floor by floor actually this
Yes.
just your rear exits are blocked off  find more routes you know you can take, of course, without much potential danger.
Okay.
So, we'll do some thinking about that then.
We 
Wha 
also, Mark, need to able to bring out most of the computer people as well.
Erm, and I know we tend to make allowances for the operations
It's in their contract that is, if they get out 
They go , they gotta hold especially and  try and get through !
 
Like the Captain of the ship.
But I do believe  that we ought to be doing more in terms of making sure they do come out  erm  you know i , we know it's only a  a training exercise  even though you leave one or two in there, but I think we ought 
Mm.
to be drawing most of those people out.
Mm.
Can we do a separate 
And we 
we could do a separate exercise then couldn't we?
We could, but I dunno how realistic it would be, I mean if there was, oh obviously it'll more realistic than doing nothing.
Mm.
But er  we need to be dragging those out at the same time as we're dragging everybody else out.
If it were real, it would happen.
And I just feel, you know, that er
So I think it's part of the  the early morning  set up and we were actually gonna talk to Steve weren't we, about
That's right.
About
what they actually bother 
Yeah.
coming out for?
Yeah.
And er 
Yeah , I think you ought to take that up with Steve, cos I don't see why you should getting, taking people 
No.
out  on the machines
Oh no!
I mean a lot 
well afterwards 
of people there's nothing apparent with them, apparent, then the machine would be er, would be   
That's right.
And the machine can wait another ten, about ten minutes  
Well, and that's a serious 
Course not.
and I think we've gotta reas , yeah  lus , leave it to Steve.
Mm.
Okay.
You gonna pick that up with Steve?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Mm.
Is the fire wardens sort of aware  you know, which way they're meant to go if their, their exits they would normally are used are blocked?
I mean, shouldn't we sort of going  well that area you 
That 
start off with?
I think that was th , one of the things raised, the procedures and floor plans
Mhm.
and the exits
Mm.
and weren't actually er, correct, and some 
Mm mm.
weren't now being used so, I think once that's out of the way.
So, sorry, say it again!
They will?
The floor plans that they were actually shown  on their training course were out of date for the procedures, so that's what my  whatever, erm security
We don't actually know but we are 
but we said  
Oh right.
we're recor , addressing that once.
Yeah.
That's a point  to what we are addressing and what we aren't.
That's a very good point!
With exactly the same one, we 
Mm.
our floor plan is, because of the number of moves and so on we've gotta have
Oh, this is where desk plan  
I'll wor , I'll work out the 
Yeah.
with the exit?
Yeah.
And all the exits are clearing off?
All the exits at the moment.
Yes they are.
Erm 
Yeah.
nothing's changed there.
And  we  whenever we do layouts now as well we insure that  all fire exits are kept to  a minimum of one and half metres wide, er, in terms of main access ways.
And, we're becoming more and more stringent on where people   pile  boxes and other  various items of rubbish.
Erm  but  we need to get some plans up  together.
I don't really  want to have   to do too many  commit myself till the ammunition's here, but we are in fact, actually er, addressing this  very specific issue.
Fe feel vulnerable for another, a number of reasons Mark in terms of updated floor plans
Mm.
and  yes, we're doing something
Mm.
to
Cos I was asking, for a number of reasons I was asking for floor plans for our , you see.
Didn't seem to be there.
I'll ask for information Norman.
Yeah.
I'm having trouble with my zip today!
Anyway  thought that'd be the general issue!
Yep.
Can we go onto computer design then?
Oh !
While you've got them out!
No!
It was just someone got one 
We got the same taste in !
Cheeky sod!
Well, you see!
You can get him some nice
We well if we don't get the package  if 
Yeah.
we get one Mark we're going to get one for the right reasons indeed.
There's a  CAD system in your end isn't there?
Yes there is.
Yeah, it's a very good one.
We use it all the time.
Well
Yeah.
We've already beaten them.
Yeah, we have looked at, but erm
Very good part of the investigation.
distributing one 
But they won't share, you know what they're like in my team it's, it's
 
Oh you don't mean it!
 
Told him you can use our  plotter any 
Erm 
time you like.
It's it's
