WALTHAM FOREST LONDON BOROUGH COUNCIL RESPONDENTS
AND THOMAS APPELLANT

June 18
Lord Templeman, Lord Griffiths, Lord Lowry, Lord Mustill and Lord Slynn of Hadley
Housing — Secure tenancy — Death of tenant — Tenant obtaining tenancy of council house 10 days before death — Tenant's brother living with him in different council premises during 12 months prior to death — Whether brother ‘resided with’ deceased tenant so as to succeed to tenancy — Housing Act 1985 (c. 68), s. 87
The defendant lived with his brother for two and a half years in property owned by the plaintiff local authority of which the brother was a secure tenant under the Housing Act 1985.
On 11 April 1988 they moved to another council house, of which the brother also became a secure tenant.
On 21 April the brother died.
The defendant claimed to have succeeded to his brother's tenancy under section 87 of the Act of 1985.
The plaintiffs disputed the claim on the ground that the defendant did not reside with his deceased brother in the same premises throughout the requisite 12-month period and brought an action in the county court for possession.
The judge made the order sought and the Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant's appeal.
On appeal by the defendant:—
Held , allowing the appeal, that on its true construction section 87 of the Act of 1985 required that the successor to a tenancy should have resided with the tenant during the period of 12 months ending with the tenant's death, but did not require the residence to have taken place for the whole of that period in the premises to which succession was claimed; and that, accordingly, the defendant was entitled to succeed to his deceased brother's tenancy (post, pp. 133B–E, 135C–F).

Waugh v. 
Middleton (1853) 8 Ex. 352
Appeal from the Court of Appeal.
This was an appeal by the defendant, Gary Thomas, by leave of the House of Lords (Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord Griffiths and Lord Lowry) granted on 17 October 1991, from an order of the Court of Appeal (Nourse and Stuart-Smith L.JJ.)(1991) 89 L.G.R. 729, dated 12 February 1991, dismissing the defendant's appeal from an order dated 4 July 1990 of Judge Butter Q.C.
in the Bow County Court.
The judge ordered on an action by the plaintiffs, Waltham Forest London Borough Council, that they should recover possession of 336, Stocksfield Road, Walthamstow, London, E.17, on the ground that the defendant did not qualify to succeed within section 87 of the Housing Act 1985 the tenant, Webster Thomas, the defendant's brother who had died while a secure tenant of the premises as the defendant had not resided at those premises for a period of 12 months ending with his brother's death.
The facts are stated in the opinion of Lord Templeman.
Stephen Sedley Q.C.and Heather Williams for the defendant.
John Perry Q.C.and Kevin Metzger for the plaintiffs.
Their Lordships took time for consideration.
18 June.
Lord Templeman.
My Lords, for about two and a half years the defendant, Mr. Gary Thomas, made his home with his brother Webster in a council house 29, Juniper Court, Morris Road, London, E.15 which belonged to and was let by the respondent local authority the Waltham Forest London Borough Council (‘the plaintiffs’) to Webster.
The letting was a secure letting for the purposes of the Housing Act 1985 and the tenant, Webster, had security of tenure.
The defendant was a person contingently qualified to succeed to the tenancy by virtue of section 87 of the Act of 1985.
That section, so far as material, provides:
‘A person is qualified to succeed the tenant under a secure tenancy if he occupies the dwelling-house as his only or principal home at the time of the tenant's death and either —(a ) he is the tenant's spouse, or (b ) he is another member of the tenant's family and has resided with the tenant throughout the period of 12 months ending with the tenant's death;…
Section 113 of the Act of 1985 defines a tenant's family in terms which include a brother.
On 11 April both brothers changed their home to 336, Stocksfield Road, Walthamstow, London, E.17 which was let to Webster by the plaintiffs.
Webster ceased to be a secure tenant of 29, Juniper Court and became a secure tenant of 336, Stocksfield Road.
Webster died on 21 April 1988.
The defendant now claims to have succeeded to Webster's secure tenancy of 336, Stocksfield Road under section 87 of the Act of 1985 because (a) he occupied 336, Stocksfield Road as his only home when his brother died;(b) he was a member of the brother's family and (c) he had resided with his brother throughout the period of 12 months ending with his brother's death.
The plaintiffs claim that the defendant did not succeed to the secure tenancy of 336, Stocksfield Road because he had not resided at 336, Stocksfield Road for 12 months before his brother died.
My Lords, section 87 does not stipulate that the successor must have resided at a particular house for 12 months but only that he should have resided with the deceased tenant for that period.
The effect of section 87 is to ensure that a qualified member of the tenant's family who has made his home with the tenant shall not lose his home when the tenant dies but shall succeed to that home and to the secure tenancy which protected both the tenant and the successor while the tenant was alive and which shall continue to protect the successor after the death of the tenant.
In order to qualify, a successor must have resided with the tenant during the period of 12 months ending with the tenant's death.
This restriction ensures that section 87 cannot be exploited, that there will be no difficulty in identifying a genuine successor and that only bona fide claims to have been residing with the tenant shall succeed.
This protection for the local authority does not require the residence to have taken place for the whole 12 months in the house to which succession is claimed.
The section only requires residence with the tenant for the period of 12 months and I see no justification for implying any other requirement.
When a tenant and a potential successor move from one council house to another the tenant does not lose the protection of a secure tenancy and there is no good reason why the potential successor should lose the protection which he has obtained or is in the course of obtaining under section 87.
When a tenant who is not already a council tenant applies for a council house, the local authority, before granting a secure tenancy finds out whether the council house will be occupied by the tenant alone or whether the council house will become the joint home of the tenant and a member of the tenant's family who has been residing with the tenant.
The local authority will know whether if they let the council house to the tenant the house will also be occupied by a potential successor who has made his home with the tenant.
If the tenant's death is untimely, that is to say within one year of the date of the letting, there is no reason why the potential successor should lose his home if he has in fact resided with the tenant for 12 months.
In the present case the plaintiffs have been unable to suggest why the defendant should lose his home as well as his brother by reason of the death of his brother.
It frequently happens that a daughter lives with a widowed parent for 20 years or more; if the parent changes council houses or moves from the private sector to a council house within one year of the death of the parent then on the death of the parent the council house will be the home which contains all the furniture and other articles which form part of the home and have been fitted into the council house by the parent and the daughter.
It would be cruel if the daughter could be evicted and left to find another home for herself and for her belongings simply because of the accident of the untimely death of the parent within one year.
In the absence of express language, section 87 should not be construed in a manner which can only, as in the present case, produce unwelcome and unjustifiable distress and hardship in the event of an untimely death.
In the present case the Court of Appeal (Nourse and Stuart-Smith L.JJ.)(1991) 89 L.G.R. 729, upholding Judge Butter Q.C.
were reluctantly constrained to order the defendant to give up possession of 336, Stocksfield Road to the plaintiffs because of the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal (Kerr and Woolf L.JJ.) in South Northamptonshire District Council v. 
Power [1987]1 W.L.R. 1433.
In that case the defendant had made her home with a tenant of a private sector house for three years and continued to make her home with the tenant when he was granted a secure tenancy of a council house.
The tenant died within nine months after the grant of the council house tenancy and it was held that section 87 did not protect the defendant.
Kerr L.J.
relied on Collier v. 
Stoneman [1957]1 W.L.R. 1108.
In that case, it was held that the sub-tenant of part of a house was not ‘residing with’ her mother in the whole house just because her sub-tenancy entitled her to share the kitchen with her mother.
In Edmunds v. 
Jones (Note)[1957]1 W.L.R. 1118, also cited by Kerr L.J., a granddaughter was allowed to occupy one room in the house of her grandmother and it was held that the granddaughter was entitled to succeed to the tenancy of the whole house.
Those cases only decided that the successor must live with the tenant in the whole of the premises.
They do not approach the present problem which arises when the successor lived with the tenant in different premises during the qualifying period.
Kerr L.J.
also relied on the reluctance of Viscount Simonds expressed in In re ‘Wonderland,’ Cleethorpes [1965]A.C. 58, 70–71, to construe an ambiguity in a statute in a manner which derogated from common law rights.
But this principle does not constrain the courts to invent an ambiguity or to construe an ambiguity in a way which does not make good sense.
In the Power case Woolf L.J.
agreed with Kerr L.J.
but left open the question whether there is any difference under section 87 if the successor has resided for 12 months with the deceased tenant in two or more council houses or has resided partly in a council house and partly in private sector accommodation:[1987]1 W.L.R. 1433, 1441H.
I can see no logical distinction.
Section 87 requires that the successor shall occupy the council house as his home at the death of the tenant and shall have resided with the tenant during ‘the period of 12 months ending with the tenant's death.’
It does not matter whether the successor and the tenant resided together in one or more houses or whether the residences were all council houses provided they resided together in a council house at the moment of death and provided that the successor and the tenant resided together during the period of 12 months prior to the death of the tenant.
In my opinion South Northamptonshire District Council v. 
Power [1987]1 W.L.R. 1433 was wrongly decided.
In his exhaustive and helpful argument on behalf of the plaintiffs, Mr. Perry relied on the Rent Acts and in particular on the amendments made by section 39 of and Schedule 4 to the Housing Act 1988 dealing with private sector lettings whereby a successor was required to reside with the deceased tenant ‘in the dwelling house’ for the period of six months before the death of the tenant.
The Rent Acts dealing with private lettings contain a number of provisions which are different from those which apply to local authority lettings under the Act of 1985.
For reasons which are not stated the legislature in 1988 made it essential for a successor to live in the dwelling house during the period of six months but did not amend the Act of 1985 so as to impose either a six months' period or residence in a particular dwelling house in the case of a council house.
The Act of 1985 only provides that residence must be ‘with the tenant.’
Mr. Perry also referred to the legislation which governs council houses in Scotland but it is impossible to imply in the Act of 1985 express words which the legislature chose to insert in the Rent Acts and in the Scottish Act (Housing (Scotland) Act 1987) but chose not to insert in the Act of 1985.
I would allow the appeal and dismiss the plaintiffs' action.
