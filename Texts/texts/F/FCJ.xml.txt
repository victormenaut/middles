Treaty (Cmnd. 5179-II), art.
52 — Merchant Shipping Act 1988 (c. 12), s. 14
Fishing vessels registered in the register of British vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 were owned or managed by the applicants, companies incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom and their directors and shareholders, most of whom were Spanish nationals.
The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 required all British fishing vessels, including those formerly registered under the Act of 1894, to be entered in a new register.
Under section 14(1) of the Act of 1988a vessel could only be entered in the new register if it was British-owned and managed and its operations were directed and controlled from within the United Kingdom, and if any charterer, manager or operator of the vessel was a qualified person or company.
By section 14(2), vessels were deemed to be British-owned if the legal title in them was vested wholly in qualified persons or companies and they were beneficially owned wholly or mainly by qualified persons or companies.
A ‘qualified person’ was defined by section 14(7) as a local authority in the United Kingdom or a British citizen resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom, and a ‘qualified company’as a company incorporated and having its principal place of business in the United Kingdom, with at least 75 per cent.
of its shares owned by qualified persons or companies and at least 75 per cent.
of its directors being qualified persons.
The Secretary of State was empowered by section 14(4) to dispense with the nationality requirement in the case of an individual on the ground of the length of time during which he had resided in the United Kingdom and had been involved in the fishing industry there.
The applicants' vessels failed to qualify for entry in the new register and they challenged the compatibility of the relevant provisions of the Act of 1988 with Community law by an application for judicial review.
The Divisional Court referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities the question whether Community law affected the conditions which a member state might prescribe for the entry of vessels in its national register and the right of vessels to fly its flag and carry its nationality.
By further questions, as reformulated in part by the Court of Justice, the Divisional Court also asked, inter alia, whether requirements as to nationality, residence, domicile and control imposed by a member state as conditions of the registration of fishing vessels and the right to fly the flag of that state were compatible with Community law, including article 7 of the E.E.C.
Treaty (principle of non-discrimination on the ground of nationality) and article 52 (right of establishment), and whether the answer to that question was affected by the existence of a power to dispense with the nationality requirement in the case of individuals and by the existence of national fishing catch quotas allocated by the Community pursuant to the Common Fisheries Policy.
On the reference:—
Held ,(1) that under Community law member states could determine in accordance with the general rules of public international law the conditions under which vessels could be entered in national registers and granted the right to fly their flags, but that in laying down those conditions the member states had to comply with Community law (post, pp. 338F–G, 343A).
Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, E.C.J.;Hellenic Republic v. Commission of the European Communities (Case 57/86)[1988]E.C.R. 2855, E.C.J. and Commission of the European Communities v. Hellenic Republic (Case 127/87)[1988]E.C.R. 3333, E.C.J. applied.
(2) That, irrespective of the existence of the present system of national catch quotas, it was contrary to Community law, and in particular to article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, for a member state to stipulate as conditions for the registration of a fishing vessel in the national register (a) that the legal and beneficial owners and the charterers, managers and operators of the vessel must be its nationals or companies incorporated in it, and, in the case of companies, that at least 75 per cent.
of the shares must be owned by its nationals or by companies fulfilling the same requirements and 75 per cent.
of the directors must be its nationals, and (b) that the legal and beneficial owners, charterers, managers, operators, shareholders or directors must be resident and domiciled in the member state, but that it was not a breach of Community law for a member state to stipulate as a condition for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register that the vessel must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within the member state (post, pp. 340H — 341B, E, 343B–D).
(3) That the fact that the competent minister of a member state had a power to dispense with the nationality requirement for an individual on the ground of his length of residence in and involvement in the fishing industry of that state could not justify, in regard to Community law, a rule under which registration of a fishing vessel was subject to a nationality requirement or a requirement as to residence and domicile (post, pp. 341H — 342A, 343D–E).
Openbaar Ministerie of the Netherlands v. van Tiggele (Case 82/77)[1978]E.C.R. 25, E.C.J. and Criminal proceedings against Anton Adriaan Fietje (Case 27/80)[1980]E.C.R. 3839, E.C.J. applied.

REFERENCE by the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division.
The report for the hearing before the Court of Justice prepared by the Judge Rapporteur, Judge Kakouris, states:
I — BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE
1.
The applicants in the main proceedings, including Factortame Ltd., were a number of companies incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom and also the directors and shareholders of those companies, most of whom were Spanish nationals.
Those companies between them owned or managed 95 fishing vessels which were until 31 March 1989 registered as British fishing vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 60).
Fifty-three of those vessels were originally registered in Spain and flew the Spanish flag.
Those 53 vessels were registered under the Act of 1894 at various dates from 1980 onwards.
The remaining 42 vessels had always been British.
They were purchased by the applicants at various dates, mainly since 1983.
2.
The statutory system governing the registration of British fishing vessels was radically altered by Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations 1988 (S.I.
1988 No. 1926).
It was common ground that the United Kingdom amended the previous legislation in order to put a stop to the practice known as ‘quota hopping’ whereby (according to that state) its fishing quotas were ‘plundered’by fishing vessels flying the British flag but lacking any genuine link with the United Kingdom.
3.
Section 13 of the Act of 1988 provided for the establishment of a new register of all British fishing vessels including those registered in the old register maintained under the Act of 1894.
However, only fishing vessels fulfilling the conditions laid down in section 14 of the Act of 1988 might be registered in the new register.
4.
The first two subsections of section 14 of the Act of 1988 read:
‘(1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), a fishing vessel shall only be eligible to be registered as a British fishing vessel if —(a ) the vessel is British-owned;(b ) the vessel is managed, and its operations are directed and controlled, from within the United Kingdom; and (c ) any charterer, manager or operator of the vessel is a qualified person or company.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a ) a fishing vessel is British-owned if —(a ) the legal title to the vessel is vested wholly in one or more qualified persons or companies; and (b ) the vessel is beneficially owned —(i) as to not less than the relevant percentage of the property in the vessel, by one or more qualified persons, or (ii) wholly by a qualified company or companies, or (iii) by one or more qualified companies and, as to not less than the relevant percentage of the remainder of the property in the vessel, by one or more qualified persons.
5.
Section 14(7) provided:
‘In this section —‘qualified company’ means a company which satisfies the following conditions, namely —(a ) it is incorporated in the United Kingdom and has its principal place of business there;(b ) at least the relevant percentage of its shares (taken as a whole), and of each class of its shares, is legally and beneficially owned by one or more qualified persons or companies; and (c ) at least the relevant percentage of its directors are qualified persons; ‘qualified person’means —(a ) a person who is a British citizen resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom, or (b ) a local authority in the United Kingdom; and ‘the relevant percentage’means 75 per cent.
or such greater percentage (which may be 100 per cent.) as may for the time being be prescribed.
6.
Under section 14(4), the Secretary of State for Transport might dispense with the nationality condition in the case of an individual in view of the length of time he had resided in the United Kingdom and been involved in the fishing industry of the United Kingdom.
7.
The Act of 1988 and the Regulations of 1988 came into force on 1 December 1988.
However, under section 13(3) (b ) and section 58 of the Act of 1988 in conjunction with regulation 66 of the Regulations of 1988, the validity of registrations made under the previous Act were extended for a transitional period until 31 March 1989.
8.
At the time of the institution of the proceedings in which the relevant application for judicial review arose, the 95 fishing vessels of the applicants failed to satisfy one or more of the conditions for registration under section 14 of the Act of 1988 and thus failed to qualify for registration.
Since those vessels could no longer engage in fishing as from 1 April 1989, the companies in question sought by means of an application for judicial review, brought on 16 December 1988 in the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, to challenge the compatibility of Part II of the Act of 1988 with Community law, in particular with articles 7, 52, 58 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
9.
On the ground that the dispute entailed an assessment of the interpretation of the provisions and principles of Community law, in particular of the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, the right of establishment and the principle of proportionality, the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division (Reg. v. Secretary of State for Transport, Ex parte Factortame Ltd. [1989]2 C.M.L.R. 353) decided, by an order of 10 March 1989 pursuant to article 177 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, to stay the proceedings pending a preliminary ruling by the Court of Justice on questions which were subsequently formulated as follows:
‘(1) Does Community law affect the conditions under which a member state lays down rules for determining which vessels are entitled to register in that state, to fly its flag and carry its nationality?
‘(2) In the light of the provisions and principles of Community law and in particular(but without limitation) the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, the right of establishment and the requirement of proportionality, is a member state entitled to stipulate that in order to be registered in and entitled to fly the flag of that member state, a fishing vessel:(a) must have its legal title vested as to 100 per cent .
in citizens of that member state, resident and domiciled therein, or vested in a company at least 75 per cent.
of the shares [of]which are legally and beneficially owned by such persons and of which at least 75 per cent.
of the directors are such persons (hereinafter called ‘a qualified company’); and (b) must be beneficially owned as to at least 75 per cent.
by citizens of that member state resident and domiciled therein, or as to 100 per cent.
by one or more qualified companies, or as to part by one or more qualified companies, provided that citizens of that member state, resident and domiciled therein, hold at least 75 per cent.
of the remaining property in the vessel; and (c) must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state; and (d) must have as its charterer, manager or operator, a citizen of that member state, resident and domiciled therein, or a qualified company, in circumstances where no exception is made in respect of nationals of other member states, save that the member state has power to dispense with the nationality requirement in respect of an individual in view of the length of time such individual has resided in the member state and has been involved in the fishing industry of the member state?
‘(3) Is the answer to question (2) affected by the existence of national catch quotas allocated to member states pursuant to the Common Fisheries Policy?
‘(4) Are the answers to questions (2) and (3) affected by the fact that the measure in question has been introduced with the object and effect of rendering a number of fishing vessels which immediately prior to the date of such measure coming into effect have been duly registered in and licensed to fish by the member state in question and which are to a substantial extent beneficially owned by nationals of another member state, resident and domiciled in that other member state, ineligible to fly the flag of the first member state with the result that they cease to be eligible to fish against the catch quotas allocated to the first member state under the Common Fisheries Policy unless ownership and management of the vessels are transferred to citizens of the first member state resident and domiciled therein in accordance with the provisions of the said measure?
II — COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE
10.
The order of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen's Bench Division, was received at the Court Registry on 17 July 1989.
11.
In accordance with article 20 of the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the E.E.C.
written observations were lodged on 25 October 1989 by the Belgian Government; on 31 October 1989 by the Commission of the European Communities; on 6 November 1989 by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany; on 11 November 1989 by the Spanish Government; on 7 November 1989 by the Greek Government; on 14 November 1989 by the Danish Government; on 14 November 1989 by Ireland; on 14 November 1989 by Factortame Ltd. and others, the applicants in the main proceedings, and on 15 November 1989 by the United Kingdom.
12.
On hearing the report of the Judge Rapporteur and the views of the Advocate General, the Court of Justice decided to open the oral procedure without any preparatory inquiry.
The Commission was asked to answer a question in writing.
It complied with that request in the time allowed.
III — WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS
13.
In the following, each of the following expressions, ‘to be registered’ in a state, ‘to have the nationality’of a state and ‘to fly the flag’of a state, should be understood as covering all three concepts.
Question (1)
14.
The United Kingdom, Belgium and Greece all took the view that Community law did not limit the competence of each state under public international law to define as it thought fit the conditions upon which it granted to a vessel the right to fly its flag.
That view, albeit qualified somewhat, was also expressed by Ireland.
15.
The United Kingdom considered that the grant of nationality to a ship was a matter of international concern which went beyond the confines of the Community.
The grant of a flag had many legal implications (determination of applicable law, in particular in the fields of civil or criminal liability, safety, fisheries, employment and social security) and placed onerous duties on a state (control in administrative, technical and social matters).
16.
International law recognised that it was for each state to determine the conditions upon which it granted its nationality to ships, subject to there being a genuine link between the flag state and the vessel.
The United Kingdom referred in that connection to article 5(1) of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas 1958 (United Nations Treaty Series 450, No. 6465)(Cmnd. 1929) which reads:
‘Each state shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag.
Ships have the nationality of the state whose flag they are entitled to fly.
There must exist a genuine link between the state and the ship; in particular, the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.
17.
That provision was part of the international public order and applied to all ships which sailed on the seas.
A similar provision (article 91(1)) was contained in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (Cmnd. 8941).
18.
The United Kingdom pointed out that, if the flag was not granted in accordance with international law, third countries might not recognise the vessel as genuinely bearing the nationality of the flag which it purported to fly, and it referred to the separate opinion of Judge Jessup in Case concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co.
Ltd., Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 1970, pp. 3, 189.
19.
In those circumstances, Community law could not deprive member states of their competence to determine the conditions for the grant of their flags to vessels.
20.
The Court of Justice recognised that principle in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, 107, para. 13.
The same view was taken by Mr. Advocate General Mischo in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193, 208, para. 7.
The same position was reflected in the third recital in the Preamble to Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76 of 19 January 1976 laying down a common structural policy for the fishing industry (Official Journal 1976 No.
L 20, p. 19), which stated that Community fishermen must have equal access to and use of fishing grounds in maritime waters coming under the sovereignty or within the jurisdiction of member states ‘subject to certain specific conditions concerning the flag or the registration of their ships.’
21.
In support of their view, Belgium and Greece also referred to article 5(1) of the Convention of 1958 and to the Convention of 1982.
22.
The exclusive competence of states with regard to the grant of their nationality was a manifestation of their sovereignty.
Community law had no effect in that regard, since no transfer of sovereignty had been agreed in that sphere.
23.
The Greek Government considered that that view was borne out by the fact that the Community legislation on the fishing industry referred to vessels ‘flying the flag of a member state’ or ‘registered in a member state’and regarded those concepts as having been defined by the laws of the member states.
It referred in that connection to paragraph 13 of the judgment in the Pesca Valentia case.
24.
Ireland took the view that, in the absence of Community rules concerning the registration of shipping, the member states retained jurisdiction to determine which vessels were entitled to register on their respective national registers.
In the context of the present case, however, it was not necessary to determine whether there were any conceivable circumstances in which Community law might affect rules in that sphere laid down by a member state.
25.
The Danish Government drew a distinction between the registration of ships in general and the registration of fishing vessels.
26.
As regards the registration of ships in general, the Danish Government referred to the Conventions of 1958 and 1982 and to the court's judgment in the Pesca Valentia case.
It concluded that Community law did not impose requirements concerning the granting to ships of flag rights.
It added that, were Community law to contain such requirements, however, they should comply with the general principles of international law under which there must be a ‘genuine link’ between the ship and the flag state.
27.
As far as the registration of fishing vessels was concerned, the Danish Government accepted that Community law had an effect on the criteria adopted by the member states, but only in so far as the application of the general requirements of registration would preclude citizens from other member states from pursuing an economic activity which they were otherwise entitled to pursue.
In order to establish whether that was the position in the present case, the Danish Government carried out an appraisal of the Community system of fishing quotas.
Its observations on this matter are set out in the section of this report dealing with question (3) submitted by the national court.
28.
The Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain, the Commission of the European Communities and the applicants in the main proceedings considered that, whilst the rules relating to the grant of the flag fell within the competence of the member states, the member states could not adopt legislation contrary to Community law.
29.
The Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain reached that conclusion, inter alia, on the basis of the judgment in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, 107, para. 13, on the one hand, and the obligation imposed on member states by Community rules, in particular Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76, to grant all fishing vessels flying their flags equal access to their fishing grounds, on the other.
The Spanish Government considered that obligation to be a particular expression of the obligation imposed on member states under article 40(3) of the E.E.C.
Treaty to comply with the principle of non-discrimination, and referred to Klensch v. Secrétaire d'Etat à l'Agriculture et à la Viticulture (Joined Cases 201/85, 202/85)[1986]E.C.R. 3477.
30.
The Commission and the applicants in the main proceedings considered that the genuine link which was required to exist between the ship and the flag state under the Conventions of 1958 and 1982 did not give the member states the power to enact their own laws with regard to flagging without having regard to the requirements of Community law.
It followed from the wording of those Conventions that the purpose of the link was simply to enable the flag state to exercise its jurisdiction and control in technical, administrative and social matters.
31.
Apart from that, in the event of a conflict between the Convention of 1958 and the E.E.C.
Treaty (quod non), article 5 of the Act of Accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom to the European Communities 1972 (Cmnd. 5179–I)(‘the Act of Accession 1972’), read together with article 234 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, required the United Kingdom to take all appropriate steps to eliminate any such incompatibilities.
32.
Moreover, in relations between member states, rights and obligations arising from the Convention of 1958 could not prevail over the obligations of member states under the E.E.C.
Treaty.
That principle was explicitly recognised in article 30 of the Convention of 1958, which provided:
‘The provisions of this Convention shall not affect conventions or other international agreements already in force, as between states parties to them.
33.
The Commission stated that the principle that member states might not infringe Community law as a result of their national legislation relating to the registration of ships was recognised during the negotiation of the United Nations Convention on Conditions for the Registration of Ships 1986.
Article 8 of that Convention, which was designed to put an end to the problems created by flags of convenience, required contracting states to adopt
‘appropriate provisions for participation by that state or its nationals as owners of ships flying its flag or in the ownership of such ships and for the level of that participation.
However, the member states participating in the negotiation of the Convention declared in a statement that they would be able to sign it only in conformity with the E.E.C.
Treaty.
34.
According to the applicants in the main proceedings, paragraph 13 of the judgment in the Pesca Valentia case [1988]E.C.R. 83, 107 constitute a fair description of the effect of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76 but no argument for the proposition that member states might define the conditions for registration without reference to basic principles of Community law.
By the same token, paragraph 7 of the opinion of Mr. Advocate General Mischo in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193, 208 should be construed as referring to the absence of specific Community legislation in that field rather than to the complete exclusion of E.E.C.
Treaty principles.
Question (2)
35.
The United Kingdom, Belgium and Greece took the view that the basic principles of Community law and, in particular, the prohibition of all discrimination based on nationality, had no bearing on conditions such as those at issue in the main proceedings.
The Danish government was of the same opinion as regards the registration of ships in general.
(The Danish Government's view on the registration of fishing vessels is set out in the section of this report dealing with question (3).)
36.
The Spanish Government, the Commission and the applicants in the main proceedings considered that conditions of the type at issue were contrary to Community law.
The applicants in the main proceedings pointed out that the Secretary of State conceded in the Divisional Court that Community law would prevent the enforcement of nationality, domicile and residence requirements as conditions for entry for Community nationals to occupations or economic activities and sought to justify the conditions on the basis of the obligations of the United Kingdom in public international law and of the special nature of the Common Fisheries Policy.
37.
The written observations submitted to the court are described below under two headings: the nationality condition, and the conditions relating to residence and domicile and to the place of operation, direction and control of the vessel.
The nationality condition
38.
The United Kingdom stated, in limine, that the nationality of the owner of the vessel was generally recognised in international law and in the practice of states as the principal criterion for establishing the necessary link between the flag state and the vessel.
It referred in that connection to article 8 of the Convention of 1986.
The nationality of the owner was the criterion applied by all the member states of the Community.
39.
In the United Kingdom's submission, articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty could not be interpreted as ipso facto sweeping away the principal criterion applied by international law and by all the member states for the grant of the right to fly a particular flag.
It puts forward the following arguments in that connection.
(a) The principle of non-discrimination presupposed the existence of the concept of nationality, but article 7 did not prevent a member state from deciding who were eligible to be its nationals or from deciding which vessels were entitled to fly its flag.
(b) The numerous domestic and international implications flowing from the grant of a flag distinguished the position from the normal situation of ‘establishment;’ consequently there could be no question of any infringement of articles 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
(c) There was an additional reason for considering that there was no infringement of article 52: the criterion of the owner's nationality did not prevent nationals of other member states from establishing themselves in the United Kingdom to operate fishing vessels — it only prevented them from doing so under the British flag.
(d) To require member states to depart from the universally recognised criterion of the owner's nationality would place Community law in conflict with international law, which should be avoided; in contrast, as a matter of general principle the E.E.C.
Treaty should be interpreted in a manner consistent with international law.
(e) Every member state adopting nationality requirements consistently with international law would be in breach of Community law, presumably since the end of the transitional periods laid down by the E.E.C.
Treaty or by the Acts of Accession; again such conflict should be avoided.
(f) To outlaw the criterion of the nationality of the owner which was currently in general use would leave it wholly unclear what criterion the member states should adopt instead.
40.
Lastly, the United Kingdom observed that the problems of the flag might be resolved by harmonisation of laws and international agreement, or even the adoption of a Community flag, rather than by blunt application of articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
41.
The Belgian, Greek and Danish Governments considered that the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality set out in articles 7, 52 and 59 of the E.E.C.
Treaty did not apply to the fundamental right possessed by each state under international law freely to decide to which persons or vessels it would or would not grant its nationality.
The prohibition of discrimination set out in article 7 of the E.E.C.
Treaty applied only where persons were treated differently under the law of a member state in areas falling within the field of application of the E.E.C.
Treaty because of their different nationality.
42.
The Belgian Government argued in that connection that the limits of articles 52 and 59 were plain: they dealt only with the freedom of any Community national to establish himself in another member state and provide services there while retaining his own nationality.
43.
The Spanish Government considered that the nationality condition and the other conditions laid down by the Act of 1988 were manifestly contrary to the basic principles of the E.E.C.
Treaty set out in articles 7, 52, 59, 67 and 221 thereof.
44.
Those principles required the elimination, not only of existing restrictions and discrimination relating to the exercise of occupational activities, but also of any barrier which might in practice prevent the effective realisation of those activities.
As far as articles 52 and 59 were concerned, that was apparent from the general programmes which were adopted by the Council of the European Communities on 18 December 1961.
45.
The Spanish Government argued that the nationality condition could not be justified under articles 55 and 56 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
Those provisions must be strictly construed.
46.
Since the investment made in companies owning fishing vessels flying the flag of a member state by nationals of another member state was direct investment and paid up in full, the condition requiring 75 per cent .
of the capital of such companies to be held by nationals was contrary to article 67 of the E.E.C.
Treaty in conjunction with the First Council Directive of 11 May 1960 for the implementation of article 67 of the E.E.C.
Treaty (Official Journal, English Special Edition 1952–1964, p. 49), as last amended by Directive (86/566/E.E.C.)
(Official Journal 1986 No.
L 332, p. 22).
47.
Lastly, the Spanish Government argued that the possibility afforded by the Act of 1988 of exempting certain persons from the nationality condition to which reference was made in the last part of the national court's question (2) in no way altered the foregoing considerations.
48.
The Commission maintained that the nationality requirements laid down in the Act of 1988 were contrary to the general prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality set out in article 7 of the E.E.C.
Treaty and with the more specific provisions of articles 52 and 221.
49.
As to article 52, the refusal to register as British fishing vessels boats owned, chartered, managed or operated by nationals of other member states, whether natural or legal persons, deprived those nationals of their right to establish themselves in the United Kingdom in order to pursue their fishing activities under the same conditions as nationals of the United Kingdom.
Moreover, the nationality requirements concerning the shareholders and directors of companies deprived those same foreign nationals of the right to set up, and act as directors of, companies in the sea fisheries sector in the United Kingdom.
Finally, those same requirements also restricted the possibility for companies of other member states, within the meaning of article 58, to exercise sea fishing activities from the United Kingdom by way of agencies, branches or subsidiaries.
50.
As far as article 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty was concerned, the British provisions concerning the control of qualified companies discriminated against nationals of other member states wishing to purchase shares in companies owning, chartering, managing or operating British fishing vessels.
51.
Measures taken by a state in order to ensure that ships flying its flag had a genuine link with it did not by any means need to contain nationality requirements such as those in section 14 of the Act of 1988.
The Commission considered that the United Kingdom was scarcely in a position to claim otherwise, since until 1988 the right to the flag of fishing vessels was governed by the far less restrictive provisions of the Act of 1894, which continued to apply to merchant ships.
52.
The fact that article 5(1) of the Convention of 1958 used the word ‘nationality’ did not call that view into question, since the flag flown by ships and the nationality of natural persons were not interchangeable concepts for all purposes.
The Commission referred in that connection to the view expressed by Professor O'Connell in The International Law of the Sea , vol.
II (1984), p. 752.
53.
The Commission observed that it was held in the order of 10 October 1989 in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case 246/89 R)[1989]E.C.R. 3125 that it had made out a prima facie case for its view on the nationality requirements.
54.
As for the possibility of granting certain persons dispensation from the nationality condition, which was mentioned in the last part of the national court's question (2), the Commission referred to Openbaar Ministerie of the Netherlands v. van Tiggele (Case 82/77)[1978]E.C.R. 25 and Criminal proceedings against Anton Adriaan Fietje (Case 27/80)[1980]E.C.R. 3839, from which it appeared that the existence of such a possibility did not redeem a national measure which was incompatible with Community law.
55.
The applicants in the main proceedings considered that the extension of the nationality requirement to holders of a beneficial interest accentuated the restrictive nature of the requirements laid down.
56.
They submitted that the nationality requirement was a clear contravention of articles 7, 40(3), 52, 53, 58 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
In particular, it was contrary to articles 7, 52 and 221 in as much as it created a complete barrier to freedom of establishment in the United Kingdom for individuals as owners and operators of fishing vessels and as directors and shareholders of companies owning or operating such vessels.
It was contrary to article 58 because it prevented or restricted companies from other member states from participating in the United Kingdom sea fishing industry by way of agencies, branches or subsidiaries.
Lastly, it was in breach of the standstill provision of article 53 of the E.E.C.
Treaty since it was introduced only in 1988.
57.
The applicants in the main proceedings also claimed that the nationality requirement amounted to a serious infringement of the rights of ‘joint venture’ boats under article 168(4) in conjunction with Annex XII to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Communities 1985 (‘the Act of Accession 1985’)(Official Journal 1985 No.
L 302, p. 23)(see further paragraph 120 below).
58.
Access to Community waters and quotas would scarcely be feasible by fishing from United Kingdom ports under the flag of another state and, in any event, the United Kingdom would still be discriminating against the nationals of other member states, who would be prevented from pursuing an economic activity under the same conditions as British nationals.
The applicants in the main proceedings referred in that connection to Reyners v. Belgium (Case 2/74)[1974]E.C.R. 631 and Segers v. Bestuur van de Bedrijfsvereniging voor Bank- en Verzekeringswezen, Groothandel en Vrije Beroepen (Case 79/85)[1986]E.C.R. 2375.
59.
The nationality requirement, along with the domicile and residence requirements, was so restrictive as to make ineligible for consideration as ‘qualified companies’ many publicly quoted companies or banks on the International Stock Exchange in London.
The conditions relating to residence and domicile and to the place of operation, direction and control of the vessel
60.
The United Kingdom maintained that the conditions relating to residence and domicile and the condition that the vessel must be operated, directed and controlled from within the United Kingdom were necessary adjuncts to the nationality requirement.
‘Domiciled in the United Kingdom’ meant living in the United Kingdom with the intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.
The condition relating to the operation, direction and control of the vessel meant that the orders for those matters must in fact come from the United Kingdom.
All those supplementary requirements were fully consistent with articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
61.
The United Kingdom based itself in that regard on international law and on the need for the flag state effectively to exercise jurisdiction over the owners, charterers and operators of vessels flying its flag.
62.
It further argued that the residence and domicile conditions were not discriminatory, because they applied equally to nationals and nationals of other member states.
A residence requirement applying without discrimination to nationals and nationals of other member states was held in Robert Fearon & Co.
Ltd. v. The Irish Land Commission (Case 182/83)[1984]E.C.R. 3677 to be compatible with article 52.
63.
In any event, residence of some kind was the hallmark of establishment in so far as establishment involved economic integration in the host member state of a kind that was greater than that which arose from the provision of a cross-border service.
64.
The Spanish Government argued that the fact that a national rule was applicable without distinction to nationals of the country concerned and to nationals of other member states did not remove its discriminatory nature:Commission of the European Communities v. Belgium (Case 221/85)[1987]E.C.R. 719.
In particular, according to the case law of the court a requirement of permanent residence in the territory of the host state was contrary to article 59 of the E.E.C.
Treaty:van Binsbergen v. Bestuur van de Bedrijfsvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid (Case 33/74)[1974]E.C.R. 1299 and in Coenen v. Sociaal-Economische Raad (Case 39/75)[1975]E.C.R. 1547.
65.
The conditions relating to residence, domicile and the place of operation, direction and control of the vessel did not fall within the derogations listed in articles 55 and 56 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
Merchant Shipping Act 1988, s. 14(1) (2)(7): see post, p. 292C–G.
S. 14(4):
‘Where, in the case of any fishing vessel, the Secretary of State is satisfied that —(a ) the vessel would be eligible to be registered as a British fishing vessel but for the fact that any particular individual, or (as the case may be) each of a number of particular individuals, is not a British citizen (and is accordingly not a qualified person), and (b ) it would be appropriate to dispense with the requirement of British citizenship in the case of that individual or those individuals, in view of the length of time he has or they have resided in the United Kingdom and been involved in the fishing industry of the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State may determine that that requirement should be so dispensed with; and, if he does so, the vessel shall, so long as paragraph (a ) above applies to it and any such determination remains in force, be treated for the purposes of this Part as eligible to be registered as a British fishing vessel.
66.
As far as the residence requirements were concerned, the Commission considered that, as it stated in its communication of 19 July 1989 on a Community framework for access to fishing quotas (Official Journal 1989 No.
C 224, p. 3), it was lawful for a member state to require operators of fishing vessels, be they individuals or companies, to maintain a real and permanent presence on shore in its territory where the vessel was registered, in so far as such presence was necessary to enable the member state to fulfil its obligations under international law and under the Common Fisheries Policy.
Such a presence must take the form of an onshore administrative unit responsible for the management of the fishing vessel concerned.
In that context the member state might also require a person appointed by the owner or operator of the vessel to be resident in its territory so as to be legally responsible for the operations of that administrative unit.
67.
Accordingly, the Commission took the view that the residence requirements laid down in section 14 of the Act of 1988 were contrary to article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty in so far as they applied to all owners, charterers, managers and operators of British fishing vessels and to 75 per cent.
of the shareholders and directors of companies owning, chartering, managing or operating such vessels.
The Commission argued that, even if the requirements in question formally applied in the same way to nationals of the host state, in reality they were discriminatory in terms of both their purpose and their effects, since the overwhelming majority of British nationals involved in the fishing industry were likely to fulfil the residence requirement.
It referred in that connection to Ordre des Avocats au Barreau de Paris v. Klopp (Case 107/83)[1984]E.C.R. 2971 and Commission of the European Communities v. Belgium .
68.
In the Commission's view, the residence requirement for shareholders was also contrary to article 1(1) of the First Directive of 11 May 1960 for the implementation of article 67 of the E.E.C.
Treaty (see paragraph 46 above).
The acquisition of shares in a British company by nationals of other member states constituted ‘direct investment on national territory by a non-resident’ or an ‘operation in securities.’
In either case, the capital movement concerned fell within list A in Annex I to the Directive.
Member states were bound by article 1(1) of the Directive to ‘grant all foreign exchange authorisations required for the conclusion or performance of transactions or for transfers between residents of member states in respect of’ such capital movements.
The Commission considered that a broad interpretation of that provision covered the type of restriction at issue in this case.
It based itself in that connection on Brugnoni v. Cassa di Risparmio di Genova e Imperia (Case 157/85)[1986]E.C.R. 2013 relating to the interpretation of article 2 of the Directive, which, in the Commission's view, was not different in substance from article 1.
69.
No provision of Community law could justify the residence requirements laid down in the Act of 1988.
70.
As regards the requirements as to domicile, the Commission pointed out that the concept of domicile had at least two different meanings in English law.
71.
According to the traditional concept of domicile, a person was domiciled in the country where he had his roots.
Accordingly, every person received at birth a ‘domicile of origin;’ he might acquire a ‘domicile of choice’in another country only by residing in that country with the intention of remaining there permanently or indefinitely.
72.
Since that traditional concept of domicile turned out to be unworkable for the purposes of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968, the Civil Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act 1982, which incorporated the Brussels Convention into English law, contained a new definition of ‘domicile’ involving in effect residence in a country with which the person concerned had a substantial connection.
73.
In view of the absence of any definition of ‘domicile’ in the Act of 1988, the Commission considered that, if the term was to be construed in its traditional sense, it must be assimilated to nationality.
It therefore referred to its observations with regard to the nationality requirements.
74.
If, on the other hand, ‘domicile’ had the meaning which that term had been given for the purposes of the application of the Brussels Convention, it must be assimilated to residence.
The Commission therefore referred to its observations on the residence requirements.
It stated that, for the purposes of maintaining a permanent presence in the form of an onshore administrative unit, the residence of a responsible person appointed by the vessel owner or operator would suffice.
75.
On the subject of the requirement that the vessel must be managed, directed and controlled ‘from within the United Kingdom,’ the Commission observed that the meaning of section 14(1) (b ) of the Act of 1988 was not clear.
If that provision precluded the permanent unit situated offshore from taking instructions from persons connected with the vessel who were in another member state, that would constitute an unjustified restriction on the freedom of establishment, contrary to article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
76.
In the view of the applicants in the main proceedings, a residence requirement would not automatically infringe article 52.
However, as the court held in Commission of the European Communities v. Belgium (Case 221/85)[1987]E.C.R. 719, such a restriction, even if formally applicable without distinction as to nationality, would be contrary to article 52 if it was contrary to the principle of equality or if it was discriminatory in its intent or effect.
77.
That was the present case.
As regards intent, the United Kingdom Government had never concealed the fact that the restrictions introduced by the Act of 1988 were intended to exclude Spanish interests from the United Kingdom fishing industry.
As for the residence requirement, despite the fact that it applied in the same way to British nationals, it constituted covert discrimination on grounds of nationality in so far as, by the very nature of things, nationals of other member states were less likely to be ‘resident’ in the United Kingdom than British citizens.
Consequently, the residence requirement had the effect of excluding from the United Kingdom sea fishing industry the vast majority of Community citizens who were not resident in the United Kingdom.
78.
It was impossible to find objective justification for applying the residence requirement to investors in or directors of companies operating in the fisheries sector.
The applicants in the main proceedings stated in that connection that there were ‘traditional communities’ of fishermen resident in the United Kingdom which there might arguably be a case for protecting by a requirement relating to the residence of the crew or ‘operators’of fishing vessels.
On the other hand, the concept of a ‘traditional community’ of shareholders, company directors and financial backers was meaningless.
79.
Lastly, the approach taken by the court in Robert Fearon & Co.
Ltd. v. The Irish Land Commission (Case 182/83)[1984]E.C.R. 3677, in which it was held that article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty did not of itself prevent a member state from imposing an ownership residence requirement as a condition for exemption from the compulsory acquisition of land, could not be followed in the present case for three reasons:(a) in the Fearon case, the owners' residence requirement was not coupled with any nationality requirement and the court indicated in paragraph 10 of the judgment, at pp. 3685–3686, that its decision would have been different if it had been;(b) in the Fearon case, the residence requirement was limited to legal owners of the land and did not extend to peripheral persons, such as those who had lent the owners money in order to buy the land; and (c) from the point of view of its geographical scope, the residence requirement at issue in the Fearon case was framed in local rather than national terms.
80.
As regards the domicile requirement, the applicants in the main proceedings considered that the element of intention in the concept of domicile, at least in its traditional meaning in English law, made it more restrictive than all the other requirements and hence more objectionable from the standpoint of Community law.
81.
The restrictive nature of the domicile requirement was increased by the fact that under the Act of 1988 the burden of proof was borne by the applicant for registration; however, evidence of a subjective intention was not easy to find especially since, where the applicant was a company, it would also be necessary to prove the state of mind of hundreds or thousands of shareholders.
82.
Even if the concept of domicile in the context of the Act of 1988 were to be accorded by the United Kingdom courts a meaning similar to that prevailing in other member states, the applicants in the main proceedings would still contend that the domicile requirement was contrary to Community law.
They referred in that connection to their arguments with regard to the residence requirement.
83.
In any event, the fact of introducing a concept with such uncertainty as ‘domicile’ into the ‘qualifications’was itself contrary to Community law, as the court held in Commission of the European Communities v. French Republic (Case 167/73)[1974]E.C.R. 359.
84.
As regards the condition relating to the place of operation, direction and control of the vessel, the applicants in the main proceedings stated in the first place that the flag state might legitimately require some measure of onshore representation in order to ensure that the authorities of that state had some method of tracing the responsibility of the operator.
However, if the condition in question were designed to ensure that all operators of fishing vessels were based in the United Kingdom, it would inhibit the export of fish by British flag vessels to other member states and so constitute a breach of article 34 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
If the requirement were tantamount to a requirement of establishment, there would be an unjustifiable restriction on the freedom of those involved in the operation and management of the vessels to provide those services.
85.
In any event, the applicants in the main proceedings took the view that the limits of the permitted purpose and extent of such a restriction should be clearly delineated for the avoidance of doubt or evasion.
Question (3)
86.
The United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland considered that the Community system of fishing quotas justified the adoption of national measures such as those described in the national court's question (2).
Similarly, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany argued that a member state might legitimately adopt appropriate criteria with regard to the grant of flag rights in order to safeguard the objectives of the Community system of fishing quotas; it considered that, if necessary, the criteria adopted to that end might be contrary to the E.E.C.
Treaty rules on free movement.
87.
The United Kingdom started by describing the historical background to the Common Fisheries Policy and set out the measures taken by the United Kingdom since 1983 to tackle the registration of Spanish fishing boats in the British register.
It stated that the British Fishing Boats Act 1983 and the British Fishing Boats Order 1983 (S.I.
1983 No. 482), under which at least 75 per cent.
of the crew of a British fishing boat were required to be of British or other Community nationality, only extended to vessels fishing within British fishery limits because of the problems of enforcement outside United Kingdom jurisdiction.
The United Kingdom pointed out that, by letter of 1 March 1983, it informed the Commission of the problem created by the registration of Spanish vessels and of its intentions in that regard and asked it to put forward measures which would enable the problem to be resolved.
It repeated this request on 1 March 1984, but the Commission took no action.
The United Kingdom informed the Commission of the measures which it was to apply as from 1 January 1986 with regard to fishing licences (measures which were the subject of Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Agegate Ltd.
(Case C 3/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
151 and Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193).
Finally, faced with the Commission's persistent failure to take any action and the damage inflicted on the British fishing industry in 1986, 1987 and 1988 by vessels owned by Spanish interests, the United Kingdom passed the Act of 1988.
88.
The United Kingdom went on to state that, in the event that, contrary to its view, articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty could apply to the grant of a flag, it submitted that the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy and in particular the quota system constituted a derogation from those articles and that the Act of 1988 fell within the scope of that derogation.
It made the following submissions in support of that argument.
89.
The system of national catch quotas inherently involved some derogation from the principles of free movement between member states and equal access to fishing stocks.
Under Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 2057/82 establishing certain control measures for fishing activities (Official Journal 1982 No.
L 220, p. 1), which was consolidated by Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 2241/87,(Official Journal 1987 No.
L 207, p. 1) as subsequently amended by Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 3483/88,(Official Journal 1988 No.
L 306, p. 2) fish catches subject to a quota were charged against the quota of the state whose flag the vessel was flying.
If vessels registered in one member state could freely change to the flag of another member state and, as a result, obtain access to the quotas of that state, the aim of the quota system, which was to ensure a fair distribution of the available fisheries resources among the member states for the benefit of their fishing regions and industries allied thereto, would be frustrated.
Unlike most other economic activities, fishing took place at sea outside the territory of any member state and the fishing vessel was free to move from territory to territory at will.
Registration of the vessel in a particular member state did not necessarily guarantee that the vessel in fact had a real economic link with the fishing community of that member state.
90.
At the time when Regulations (E.E.C.) Nos. 2057/82 and 170/83 (Official Journal 1983 No.
L 24, p. 1) were adopted, all the member states applied to registration similar nationality requirements to those laid down in the Act of 1988.
It was inconceivable that the member states would have agreed, after years of negotiations, to a Common Fisheries Policy based on rules of registration that were themselves incompatible with Community law.
It was hard to imagine the member states reaching an agreement had they known that the basis of quota system was liable to be circumvented.
Moreover, in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83 the court recognised that the member states were competent to adopt legislation regarding the grant of the flag.
91.
In his opinion in Ex parte Agegate Ltd. [1990]2 Q.B.
151, 176–177, paras.
73–83, Mr. Advocate General Mischo recognised that the quota system itself derogated from certain rules of Community law and in particular from the principle of free access.
92.
The argument to the contrary put forward by the Commission was unfounded.
In the first place, it was not correct to regard the quota system as secondary legislation, which, as such, could not derogate from the E.E.C.
Treaty.
Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83, which introduced the quota system, amended article 100 of the Act of Accession 1972 and formed an important part of the Act of Accession 1985.
93.
Secondly, it appeared from Pigs Marketing Board v. Redmond (Case 83/78)[1978]E.C.R. 2347 that where the aim in question was the attainment of the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy, the agricultural objectives of the E.E.C.
Treaty took precedence over the other provisions.
94.
In any event, in Société les Commissionnaires Réunis S.à.r.l. v. Receveur des Douanes (Joined Cases 80/77, 81/77)[1978]E.C.R. 927 the court expressly recognised the possibility of derogations from or exceptions to the E.E.C.
Treaty if they arose expressly or by necessary implication.
Such derogations had been authorised by case law, for example,Officier van Justitie v. Kramer (Joined Cases 3/76, 4/76, 6/76)[1976]E.C.R. 1279;Commission of the European Communities v. Federal Republic of Germany (Case 205/84)[1986]E.C.R. 3755 (on insurance);United Kingdom v. Commission of the European Communities (Case 61/86)[1988]E.C.R. 431 and Commission of the European Communities v. Council of the European Communities (Case 51/87)[1988]E.C.R. 5459.
95.
The Commission's communication of 19 July 1989 on a Community framework for access to fishing quotas (Official Journal 1989 No.
C 224, p. 3) marked a shift from the position previously adopted by the Commission in that area.
In paragraph 2.6 of that communication the Commission stated that
‘Given the present and foreseeable state of fishery resources in the Community and the degree to which fishing fleets have so far been restructured, the full-scale liberalisation of the activities of undertakings must be ruled out for the time being…
96.
The report of the European Parliament, entitled ‘Blue Europe’(document A 2-0319/88), was to the same effect where it stated that
‘if freedom of establishment were to be fully applied in the fisheries sector, it would create a serious economic, social and political crisis in the Community's maritime regions.
97.
The Act of 1988 was designed precisely to ensure that the fish quotas allocated to the United Kingdom actually enured to the benefit of persons for whom they were intended.
In the fisheries sector, ownership and fishing were clearly linked.
Thus there was no necessary dichotomy between ‘the owners’ on the one hand and ‘the fishermen’on the other.
Moreover, the owners of fishing vessels could legitimately be regarded as part of the fisheries community which the Common Fisheries Policy was designed to support.
98.
In Romkes v. Officier van Justitie (Case 46/86)[1987]E.C.R. 2671 the court held that the system of national quotas was not prohibited by article 7.
It followed that the conditions introduced by the Act of 1988, whose sole object and effect was to support the Common Fisheries Policy, were not discriminatory.
99.
Lastly, the United Kingdom argued that, if any national of a member state could establish himself in another member state and, without more, exercise the same right to fish as that enjoyed by the nationals of that latter member state, it would not only be the quota system which would be undermined.
That would also be true of the rules applicable to local communities particularly dependent upon fishing and industries allied thereto referred to in Annex VII to the Hague Resolution 1976 (‘the Hague preferences’), the reserved coastal zone, the carefully balanced fisheries mechanisms set out in articles 156 to 166 and 346 to 353 of the Act of Accession 1985 and the effort made by the member states with regard to the restructuring of their fishing fleets pursuant to the Community's multiannual programmes.
100.
All the conditions set out in the Act of 1988 were proportionate to the achievement of the objective pursued, namely the protection of the United Kingdom quota against all practices designed to circumvent the quota system.
101.
The Belgian Government considered that the problem raised in the case arise solely because the institutions of the European Communities fixed the quotas per member state.
It considered that the quotas must be regarded as limitations imposed by the institutions of the European Communities themselves on the right, created by article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, freely to carry on a business.
102.
In those circumstances, difficulties should not be caused to member states which defended themselves against practices designed to circumvent the quota system by determining in accordance with international law the criteria on whose basis they granted vessels the right to fly their flag.
Such practices were also incompatible with the policy pursued by the Community in the field of the restructuring of the fishing fleets of the member states.
103.
The Danish Government emphasised the correlation which must exist between the member states' quotas and the local fishing areas which the quotas were to benefit.
It also stressed that the quotas constituted a derogation from the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, and it referred in that connection to the order of 10 October 1989 in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case 246/89 R)[1989]E.C.R. 3125.
Accordingly, it submitted that a member state might introduce rules which entailed that nationals of other member states might utilise that member state's quotas only if they had a close connection with that state.
104.
Nationality and residence constituted criteria which a member state might legitimately employ to that end.
Consequently, a member state would be bound to authorise the registration of a vessel of nationals of another member state only if those nationals were entitled, in the light of those criteria, to benefit by the quotas of the first member state.
105.
Ireland stressed that the Act of 1988 was directed to ensuring that the economic benefits of the quotas allocated to the United Kingdom accrued to British fishing communities.
That objective was in keeping with the aims of the quota system.
The quota system was held in Romkes v. Officier van Justitie to be non-discriminatory.
The Act of 1988 should also be held not to be discriminatory.
106.
The Act of 1988 was not disproportionate to the legitimate end to be achieved.
107.
Should the court take the view that measures such as those contained in the Act of 1988 were contrary to article 52 or article 58 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, Ireland submitted that such measures were justified having regard to article 56(1) on the ground that the protection of the rights of local fishing communities fell within the concept of ‘public policy.’
If that was correct, there could be no question of any infringement of articles 7 and 221, which were expressed to be without prejudice to the other provisions of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
108.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany stated that events in Great Britain, but also more recent developments in the Federal Republic of Germany with regard to the increasing purchase of firms by fishing undertakings from other member states and the attempted re-flagging of fishing vessels from other member states, showed that the stability objective pursued by the Common Fisheries Policy might be impaired.
109.
There was no express provision in Community law dealing with the resolution of any conflicts between, for example, free access to the fishing grounds of the other member states (which had been restricted by Community law itself) and stability of the national fisheries markets.
110.
The Commission communication of 19 July 1989 on a Community framework for access to fishing quotas was not appropriate to resolve that conflict, because it did not tackle the problem of the effective exploitation of the catch quotas allocated to the member states.
111.
It was therefore for the member states to take suitable measures.
It would be appropriate to establish a close economic connection between regions especially dependent on fishing and allied industries, on the one hand, and the use of the national quota, on the other, as the criterion for granting the flag.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany referred by way of example to the possibility of requiring the relevant fishing vessel to operate from the member state in which it was registered, its crew to be affiliated to the social security scheme of that member state or supply contracts relating to the purchase of the catch to be concluded with local undertakings.
Should those measures be insufficient, the member state might have recourse to other criteria which prove appropriate, because, in that respect, the aims of the Common Fisheries Policy could take precedence over the rules on free movement laid down in the E.E.C.
Treaty.
112.
The Spanish Government, the Commission and the applicants in the main proceedings considered that the answers which they considered should be given to question (2) were unaffected by the existence of the quota system.
113.
The Spanish Government argued that the quota system was established by Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83 in order to conserve fishery resources, not to provide a means of partitioning the markets and establishing barriers to the free movement of persons within the Community.
Therefore, the rules adopted by member states pursuant to article 5(2) of that Regulation could never infringe the basic principles of Community law.
114.
In any event, the conditions at issue in the present case were contrary to the principle of proportionality and to the principle of respect for vested rights.
115.
The Commission stated in limine that in 1983, before Spain had become a member of the Community, the United Kingdom had not taken appropriate measures to exclude ‘Anglo-Spanish’ vessels from its fishing fleet, apparently because those vessels fished mainly in areas to the west of Ireland and mostly for species (such as hake) for which there was a much better market in Spain than in the United Kingdom.
It would also appear that the traditional British fleet had not previously fished for those stocks and was at that time still unable to exploit them fully.
116.
The Act of 1988 did not govern access to quotas, but the registration of fishing vessels.
It therefore governed access to all fishing at sea, including fishing for stocks not subject to quotas.
117.
The Commission drew a distinction.
It considered that if the Community's system of quotas in its present form allowed member states to introduce certain requirements whose compatibility with Community law could only be justified by the necessity to attain the objectives of that system, then such requirements could only be incorporated into the quota licences or other quota management measures which the United Kingdom must lay down for the management of its quotas under article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83, and not be imposed as conditions for the registration of vessels.
Moreover, while restrictive licence conditions which might be justified under the present quota system might lose their justification if that system developed into a more integrated system for the management of fishery sources, the same would not be the case with restrictions on the registration of vessels.
118.
In conclusion, the Commission considered that the existence of the quota system was irrelevant to the compatibility with Community law of the requirements for the registration of vessels referred to in question (2).
119.
As for the view that the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy (and, in particular, the provisions relating to the quota system) constituted a derogation from the fundamental principles of the E.E.C.
Treaty, including the principle of non-discrimination set out in article 40(3), the Commission considered that, contrary to the statements in paragraph 26 of the order of 10 October 1989 in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case 246/89 R)[1989]E.C.R. 3125, 3132–3133, the present quota system, while limiting access to certain fishery resources, did not affect the principle of equal access to those limited resources for the fishermen of all member states.
It cited in support of that view Romkes v. Officier van Justitie (Case 46/86)[1987]E.C.R. 2671.
120.
The applicants in the main proceedings observed in limine that (a) 36 of their 95 fishing vessels were part of the United Kingdom fleet during the period 1973 to 1978 (the reference period for the allocation of the quotas which were introduced in January 1983);(b) 85 of those 95 vessels were registered and in use as British fishing vessels by January 1983, and (c) of those 85 vessels, 42 had always been British flag vessels and 43 were ex-Spanish flag boats which had transferred to the British flag before 1983.
Those 43 vessels were accepted by the United Kingdom and Community authorities as ‘joint venture’ boats by virtue of article 168(4) of and Annex XII to the Act of Accession 1985.
121.
That fact made nonsense of the description ‘quota hoppers’ applied by the British authorities to the applicants' vessels and accentuated the breach of their rights under those provisions of the Act of Accession 1985.
122.
The applicants in the main proceedings considered that the Common Fisheries Policy did not provide any justification for the provisions of the Act of 1988.
They made the following observations in that regard.
123.
The Common Fisheries Policy was part of the Common Agricultural Policy.
All the basic fisheries regulations were adopted pursuant to article 42 and/or article 43 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
124.
It followed from article 38(2) of the E.E.C.
Treaty and Société les Commissionnaires Réunis S.à.r.l. v. Receveur des Douanes (Joined Cases 80/77, 81/77)[1978]E.C.R. 927 that the basic E.E.C.
Treaty provisions would override the specific rules of the Common Agricultural Policy, unless a contrary indication existed.
125.
There was no express provision in articles 39 to 46 of the E.E.C.
Treaty which could conceivably be interpreted as requiring member states to derogate from the basic E.E.C.
Treaty principles to the extent that the United Kingdom had sought to do.
On the contrary, it was clear from article 40(3) and Klensch v. Secrétaire d'Etat à l'Agriculture et à la Viticulture (Joined Cases 201/85, 202/85)[1986]E.C.R. 3477 that the principle of non-discrimination applied to the acts of member states in the agricultural sector.
In particular, the application of that principle to national measures in the fisheries sector was confirmed by Asociación Profesional de Empresarios de Pesca Comunitarios (Apesco) v. Commission of the European Communities (Case 207/86)[1988]E.C.R. 2151.
126.
The Common Fisheries Policy, and in particular the quota system, had not acquired ‘E.E.C.
Treaty status’ by reason of its ‘incorporation’into the Act of Accession 1985, as the United Kingdom claimed.
There was no suggestion in the Act of Accession 1985 that the Common Fisheries Policy was to be read without reference to the basic principles of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
Moreover, if the United Kingdom were right, its acceptance of the 43 ‘joint venture’ vessels named in the Act of Accession 1985 would also have ‘E.E.C.
Treaty status.’
127.
Secondary Community legislation could not of itself authorise derogations from the E.E.C.
Treaty.
On the contrary, it appeared from several provisions relating to the Common Fisheries Policy that that policy, far from being exempt from the basic principles of Community law (such as the prohibition of discrimination, the right of establishment and the principle of the free movement of goods), was expressly subjected to each of them.
128.
In support of that view, the applicants in the main proceedings cited, inter alia,(a) article 2 of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76 (Official Journal 1976 No.
L 20, p. 19), which laid down the principle of equal access to fishing grounds;(b) the thirtieth recital in the Preamble to Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 3796/81 on the common organisation of the market in fishery products (Official Journal 1981 No.
L 379, p. 1), according to which the levying of any customs duty or charge having equivalent effect and the application of any quantitative restriction or measure having equivalent effect were prohibited in the internal trade of the Community;(c) article 8(1) of that Regulation, which, as regards the payment of an indemnity to producers who were not members of a producers' organisation, provided that such an indemnity was to be granted without discrimination as to the nationality or place of establishment of the recipients;(d) article 27(2) of that Regulation, which laid down for all fishing vessels flying the flag of one of the member states the principle of equal access to ports and first-stage marketing installations in the other member states;(e) article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83, which authorised the member states to determine the detailed rules for the utilisation of the quotas allocated to them, in accordance with the applicable Community provisions; and (f) article 13(2) of Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 3094/86 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources (Official Journal 1986 No.
L 288, p. 1), in conjunction with the thirteenth recital in the Preamble thereto, from which it appeared that the principle of non-discrimination was one of the ‘minimum requirements’ laid down by Community law in that field.
129.
As for article 10(1) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 2057/82 (Official Journal 1982 No.
L 220, p. 1) providing that all fish catches subject to quota made by vessels ‘flying the flag’ or ‘registered’in a member state should be charged against the quota applicable to that state, the applicants in the main proceedings maintained that there was no basis for suggesting that that provision permitted member states to derogate as regards the grant of the flag from their basic E.E.C.
Treaty obligations.
130.
The court held in paragraph 13 of the judgment in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, 107, interpreting Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76, that the terms ‘flying the flag’ and ‘registered’were left to be defined in the legislation of the member states.
However, the court also said in the same paragraph that Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76 required member states to respect the principle that there should be no discrimination against nationals of other member states.
131.
The argument which the United Kingdom based on the opinion of Mr. Advocate General Mischo in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Agegate Ltd.
(Case C 3/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
151 and Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193 in support of its view that the quota system permitted member states to derogate from the E.E.C.
Treaty was without foundation.
132.
The Act of 1988 was not designed to make sure that the United Kingdom fishing quotas actually benefited the persons who were intended to benefit thereby.
The quotas allocated to a member state should benefit the fishing communities of that state.
The activities reserved for persons protected by the Act of 1988 were not exclusively or even predominantly fishing activities.
Moreover, the great majority of members of the fishing communities of the United Kingdom were either not affected by the Act at all or severely disadvantaged by it.
Lastly, the ‘joint venture’ vessels, which were principally affected by the Act of 1988, had made a significant contribution to the economic and social development of Milford Haven.
133.
Even if the Act of 1988 protected the traditional fishing communities of the United Kingdom, it should respect the principle of proportionality.
The nationality, domicile and residence requirements, with all their unfairnesses and anomalies, could not be the least burdensome way of ensuring the survival of the quota system or of the fishing communities.
134.
Lastly, the applicants in the main proceedings pointed out that the conditions imposed by the Act of 1988 attached to the registration of fishing vessels rather than to the issue of licences to fish for quota stock.
Consequently, the application of the conditions to vessels fishing entirely for non-quota stocks, such as The Brisca of Rawlings (Trawling) Ltd., was without any justification.
Question (4)
135.
The United Kingdom argued that there was nothing in the manner of its introduction, or in the fact that it affected the Anglo-Spanish vessels, that made the Act of 1988 incompatible with Community law.
136.
In particular, the Act of 1988 provided a four-month transitional period.
It applied only prospectively and did not have the effect of rendering unlawful conduct which had previously been lawful.
137.
The fact that the applicants in the main proceedings had for some time circumvented the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy did not give them any legitimate expectation that they would be allowed to continue to do so in the future.
Since 1983 the United Kingdom had taken a series of measures to tackle the problem of quota hopping.
In contrast, it was the activity of the applicants which had deprived the British fishing industry of its legitimate expectation under the quota system.
138.
It followed from Ferriera Valsabbia S.p.A.
v. Commission of the European Communities (Joined Cases 154/78, 205/78, 206/78, 226/78, 227/78, 228/78, 263/78, 264/78, 31/79, 39/79, 83/79, 85/79)[1980]E.C.R. 907 that the guarantee afforded to the ownership of property did not extend to protect commercial interests, the uncertainties of which were part of the very essence of economic activity.
139.
Ireland considered that in view of the involvement of the vessels of the applicants in the main proceedings in the quota hopping exercise, on the one hand, and of the measures taken by the United Kingdom going back to 1983, on the other, the owners of those vessels could have no legitimate expectation with regard to the continuation of their activities.
140.
The Belgian Government and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany proposed that question (4) should simply be answered in the negative.
141.
In the view of the Spanish Government, whatever the objective of the words of the national court set out in question (4), the fact remained that the Act of 1988 was incompatible with the basic principles of the Community.
142.
The Commission considered that a separate answer to question (4) was neither necessary nor appropriate.
143.
The applicants in the main proceedings considered that the Act of 1988 infringed the general principles of protection of acquired rights and legitimate expectations.
In particular, they referred in that connection to the infringement of the rights conferred on the ‘joint venture’ vessels by article 168(4) of the Act of Accession 1985, read in conjunction with Annex XII thereto.
IV — Reply to the Question Put by the Court
144.
The court asked the Commission to answer the following question:
‘In its written observations the Commission mentions, with regard to the Community system for the conservation of fishery resources, the possibility of a development ‘into a more integrated system for the management of fishery resources.’
The Commission is requested to give detailed particulars of this possibility and of the measures adopted or to be adopted with a view to establishing this integrated system.
145.
In reply, the Commission stated that under articles 4(2) and 8 of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83 it was to submit to the Council of the European Communities before 31 December 1991 a report on the fisheries situation in the Community, the economic and social development of the coastal areas and the state of the stocks and their likely evolution.
On the basis of that report the Council, acting under the procedure of article 43 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, would adopt ‘the adjustments that it may prove necessary to make to the distribution of the resources among member states.’
146.
The Commission stated that it was not at present in a position to indicate which measures it might propose to the Council in that report.

Mr. Advocate General Mischo delivered the following opinion in Reg. v. Secretary of State for Transport, Ex parte Factortame Ltd.
(No. 3)(Case C 221/89) and in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89).
1.
The factual and legal background to the two cases with which this opinion is concerned is well known to the court.
The cases form part of a series of actions relating to the various measures which the United Kingdom and Ireland took successively from 1983 onwards in order to combat what is termed in English as ‘quota hopping,’ that is to say the practice whereby, according to the United Kingdom, its fishing quotas are ‘plundered’by vessels flying the British flag but lacking any genuine link with the United Kingdom.
The history of the British measures is summarised in the interlocutory order of the President of the court of 10 October 1989 in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89 R)[1989]E.C.R. 3125.
2.
As can be seen from paragraph 3 of the reports for the hearings in the two cases, the British legislation at issue, dating from 1988, provides for the establishment of a new register of all British fishing vessels including those registered in the old register maintained under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894.
However, only fishing vessels fulfilling the conditions laid down in section 14 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 may be registered in the new register.
3.
Section 14(1) provides that, subject to a dispensation granted by the Secretary of State for Transport, a fishing vessel is only to be eligible to be registered in the new register if:
‘(a ) the vessel is British-owned;(b ) the vessel is managed, and its operations are directed and controlled, from within the United Kingdom; and (c ) any charterer, manager or operator of the vessel is a qualified person or company.
Under section 14(2), a fishing vessel is to be regarded as being British-owned if the legal title to the vessel is vested wholly in one or more qualified persons or companies and the vessel is beneficially owned wholly by a qualified company or companies or, as to at least 75 per cent., by one or more qualified persons.
Section 14(7) states that ‘qualified person’ means a person who is a British citizen resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom and that ‘qualified company’means a company which is incorporated in the United Kingdom and has its principal place of business there; at least 75 per cent.
of its shares must be owned by one or more qualified persons or companies and at least 75 per cent.
of its directors must be qualified persons.
4.
The question to be considered is whether and to what extent laying down such requirements for the registration of fishing vessels is compatible with Community law and in particular with articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
In the proceedings relating to the action for a declaration that the United Kingdom has failed to fulfil its obligations under the E.E.C.
Treaty (Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89)) only the requirements relating to the nationality of the natural or legal persons in question are at issue.
In the case of the reference for a preliminary ruling (Case C 221/89) it will also be necessary, in connection with the second question before the court, to consider the requirements relating to the residence and domicile of the natural persons in question or to the principal place of business of the companies, and to the place of management, direction and control of the vessels.
In view of the questions put by the national court and of the written observations submitted by the parties, account will have to be taken in the course of that examination of the competence of the member states in this area, of their obligations under public international law (question (1) in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89) and of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and, in particular, of the quota system (question (3) in the Factortame case).
Lastly, question (4) referred to the court in Case C 221/89 is concerned with the fact that the Act of 1988 also applies to fishing vessels which were registered in the old register but, because they do not satisfy all the new requirements, in principle ceased to be registered on 31 March 1989.
1.
The scope of the competence of the member states with regard to the registration of fishing boats
5.
It is uncontested that, as Community law stands at present, competence to determine the conditions for the registration of fishing boats is vested in the member states.
The court confirmed this in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, 107, para. 13, in which it held that, although the Community regulations on fisheries referred to fishing vessels ‘flying the flag’ of a member state or ‘registered’there, they left those terms to be defined in the legislation of the member states.
6.
This does not mean, however, that the member states may exercise that competence in complete liberty without regard to the principles of Community law.
7.
In Commission of the European Communities v. Hellenic Republic (Case 127/87)[1988]E.C.R. 3333, 3348, para. 7 the court referred to its established case law: see, inter alia,Hellenic Republic v. Commission of the European Communities (Case 57/86)[1988]E.C.R. 2855 to the effect that the fact that member states retain certain monetary powers does not entitle them to take unilateral measures prohibited by the E.E.C.
Treaty.
8.
Consequently, without having to decide whether the right of registration is a retained power or whether the Community could legislate at any time in that field, it must be held that in exercising that competence the member states must comply with the general rules of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
9.
What is at issue in this case is the taking up, on a self-employed basis, of activities in the fisheries sector and the pursuit of those activities, in other words, the right of establishment in the fisheries sector.
Indeed, even without having to go so far as the Commission of the European Communities did at the hearing in arguing that registration itself already constitutes a form of establishment, it must be observed that in any event registration is a precondition for taking up and pursuing activities in the fisheries sector.
In Steinhauser v. City of Biarritz (Case 197/84)[1985]E.C.R. 1819, 1827, para. 16, the court held that freedom of establishment, as provided for in article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, included the right not only to take up activities as a self-employed person but also to pursue them in the broad sense of the term and that ‘The renting of premises for business purposes furthers the pursuit of an occupation and therefore falls within the scope of article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.’
Moreover, in Commission of the European Communities v. Hellenic Republic (Case 305/87)[1989]E.C.R. 1461, 1478, para. 21, the court pointed out that, as it had held on several occasions (see, inter alia,Commission of the European Communities v. Italian Republic (Case 63/86)[1988]E.C.R. 29), the prohibition of all discrimination on grounds of nationality set out in article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty
‘is concerned not solely with the specific rules on the pursuit of an occupation but also with the rules relating to the various general facilities which are of assistance in the pursuit of that occupation.
What was at issue in that case was the right to acquire, use or dispose of immovable property on the territory of another member state; the court held that that right was the ‘corollary’ of freedom of establishment.
10.
I take the view that the right to register a fishing vessel , as a precondition for pursuing the activity of fishing in another member state, likewise constitutes an element which is inseparable from the right of establishment in the sea-fishing sector and, on that basis, falls within the sphere of application of article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
The fact that it was not expressly mentioned in the Council of the European Communities' general programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment (Official Journal, English Special Edition, Second Series, p. 7) makes no difference, since, useful as it is, the programme only contains guidelines and is not exhaustive.
However, it appears from Annex III thereto, to which paragraph D of Title IV (timetable) of the programme refers, that it also covers the elimination of restrictions on freedom of establishment in the sea-fishing sector.
11.
It also appears from the court's case law (see, for example,Stanton v. Institute National d'Assurances Sociales pour Travailleurs Indépendants (Inasti)(Case 143/87)[1988]E.C.R. 3877, 3912, para. 10) that article 52, as a directly applicable rule of Community law, is binding on the member states even though , in the absence of Community legislation, they retain legislative jurisdiction in the particular field.
12.
The United Kingdom and certain other member states contest that view on the ground that the E.E.C.
Treaty and, in particular, articles 7, 52 and 221 thereof cannot be interpreted as depriving the member states of their  competence under public international law with regard to the registration of ships.
13.
As far as public international law is concerned, the member states in question refer above all to the Geneva Convention of 29 April 1958 on the High Seas, article 5(1) of which expressly recognises the right of each state to fix ‘the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag.’
The same provision stipulates in this connection that ‘There must exist a genuine link between the state and the ship’ and that
‘in particular, the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.
14.
Admittedly, the first paragraph of article 234 of the E.E.C.
Treaty provides that
‘The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before the entry into force of this Treaty between one or more member states on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of this Treaty.
Although the Geneva Convention was not signed until 29 April 1958, that is to say after the E.E.C.
Treaty entered into force on 1 January 1958, the United Kingdom may in principle rely on it, since under article 5 of the Act of Accession 1972 (Cmnd. 5179-I):
‘Article 234 of the E.E.C.
Treaty and articles 105 and 106 of the Euratom Treaty shall apply, for the new member states, to agreements or conventions concluded before accession.
15.
It appears, however, from the case law of the court (see, as regards a convention concluded after the entry into force of the E.E.C.
Treaty but before the accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark,Attorney-General v. Burgoa (Case 812/79)[1980]E.C.R. 2787) that the purpose of article 234
‘is to lay down, in accordance with the principles of international law, that the application of the [E.E.C.]
Treaty does not affect the duty of the member state concerned to respect the rights of non-member countries under a prior agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.’
(The Burgoa case, at p. 2802, para. 8.)
In Ministère Public v. Deserbais (Case 286/86)[1988]E.C.R. 4907, 4926, para. 18 the court concluded from that case law that:
‘provided that…the rights of non-member countries are not involved, a member state cannot rely on the provisions of a pre-existing convention of that kind in order to justify restrictions on the marketing of products coming from another member state where the marketing thereof is lawful by virtue of the free movement of goods provided for by the Treaty.
It seems to me that the same reasoning can be applied in this case: in so far as compliance with the rules of the E.E.C.
Treaty in relations between the member states does not jeopardise non-member countries' rights under the Geneva Convention of 1958, the United Kingdom cannot rely on that Convention in order to justify infringements of those rules.
No provision of the Convention of 1958 obliges it to have recourse to particular conditions in order to ensure that there is a ‘genuine link’ between it and the ships to which it intends to grant flag rights.
Consequently, even if a non-member country may possibly be entitled not to recognise a flag granted in a manner contrary to the Geneva Convention, it can do so only in so far as there is no ‘genuine link,’ regardless as to its nature, between the vessel and the state whose flag it is flying.
Moreover, unless the United Kingdom is taken to be consciously disregarding the very international obligations on the basis of which it claims that the requirements at issue are compatible with Community law, the fact that those requirements are applicable only to fishing vessels tends to show that, in the United Kingdom's eyes also, they are not the sole requirements suitable for ensuring the existence of a ‘genuine link’ as required by international law.
16.
In so far as the United Kingdom might wish to argue that it itself has the right under the Convention to retain requirements such as those at issue, reference can also be made to the court's judgment in Commission of the European Economic Community v. Italian Republic (Case 10/61)[1962]E.C.R. 1, from which it appears that according to the principles of international law, a member state which, by virtue of the entry into force of the E.E.C.
Treaty, assumes new obligations which conflict with rights held under an earlier agreement ipso facto agrees to forgo the  exercise of such rights to the extent necessary for the performance of its new obligations (cf. summary at p. 1, para. 2).
In that judgment the court expressly adopted, at p. 10, the Commission's argument to the effect that
‘the terms ‘rights and obligations’ in article 234 refer, as regards the ‘rights,’to the rights of third countries and, as regards the ‘obligations,’to the obligations of member states…
That led the court to hold in that judgment that, as a result of article 234, a member state might have to apply, in its relations with the other member states, rules different from those which it applied in its relations with non-member countries, even though they were all party to the same international convention.
The Geneva Convention of 1958 itself recognises that that possibility exists by providing in article 30 that ‘The provisions of this Convention shall not affect conventions or other international agreements already in force, as between state parties to them.’
17.
In order to escape those conclusions the United Kingdom argued in its rejoinder in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89)(see paragraph 2.17 and 2.18 of that document and paragraph 89 of the report for the hearing) and at the hearing that the criterion of the nationality of the owner of the vessel merely reflected customary international law, which the E.E.C.
Treaty could not be assumed to disregard.
Without its even being necessary to resolve the question of the hierarchy of legislation which is implicit in this argument, I consider that it must be rejected, since even though according to the Preamble to the Geneva Convention of 1958 its provisions are ‘generally declaratory of established principles of international law,’ I do not consider the United Kingdom's statement to be well founded.
On the one hand, as I have just observed, the Convention itself confines itself to requiring there to be a ‘genuine link’ between the flag state and the ship.
On the other hand, it is explicitly stated in the report of the International Law Commission, to which the United Kingdom itself refers, that, in view of the divergent practice in the various states, the International Law Commission
‘thought it best to confine itself to enunciating the guiding principle that, before the grant of nationality is generally recognised, there must be a genuine link between the ship and the State granting permission to fly its flag
and did ‘not consider it possible to state in any grater detail what form this link should take’(see Annex I to the Commission's reply in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89).
18.
As for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982 (Cmnd. 8941), of which the Community is a signatory but which has not yet entered into force, it contains provisions similar to article 5(1) of the Geneva Convention of 1958 (see articles 91 and 94).
Lastly, the United Nations Convention of 1986 on Conditions for the Registration of Ships, which no member state has yet signed, even goes as far as expressly to confer on states party thereto the right to choose between the criterion of the nationality of the owner and the criterion of the nationality or place of residence of the crew (see articles 7, 8 and 9, and Annex I to the Commission's written observations in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89).
Whilst, therefore, the criterion of the owner's nationality is consistent with a fairly widespread international practice, it cannot be regarded as forming part of customary international law.
19.
Nor, in my view, is it possible to accept the argument of the United Kingdom, also put forward by Belgium and Greece and, as regards ships in general, Denmark, that articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty have no bearing on requirements of the type at issue in this case.
20.
I accept that the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality does, as the United Kingdom maintains, presuppose the existence of the concept of nationality and that, as the Belgian, Greek and Danish Governments point out, the prohibition of discrimination set out in Articles 7, 52 and 59 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, applies only where the legislation of a member state treats individuals differently on account of their different nationality.
However, it seems to me to be incorrect to conclude as a result that article 7 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, together with articles 52 and 221, which are specific expressions of that article, cannot apply to nationality requirements of the type at issue in this instance.
21.
The principle of non-discrimination prohibits all discrimination on grounds of nationality both between ships of the member states and between nationals of the member states, as the case may be.
As far as fishing vessels are concerned, the principle is, moreover, expressly set out in article 2(1) of Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76 of 19 January 1976 laying down a common structural policy for the fishing industry (Official Journal 1976 No.
L 20, p. 19), which provides:
‘Rules applied by each member state in respect of fishing in the maritime waters coming under its sovereignty or within its jurisdiction shall not lead to differences in treatment of other member states.
Member states shall ensure in particular equal conditions of access to and use of the fishing grounds situated in the waters referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph for all fishing vessels flying the flag of a member state and registered in Community territory.
It is from this general rule of equal conditions of  access to fisheries resources that derogation is made by the system of national quotas (see paragraph 24 of the judgment in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd .
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193, 221–222), as established by Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources (Official Journal 1983 No.
L 24, p. 1), whereby only fishing vessels flying the flag of or registered in a member state may fish against the quotas allocated to that member state, which in other words are reserved to ‘national’ vessels to the exclusion of vessels from other members states.
(For the compatibility with the E.E.C.
Treaty, and in particular with articles 7 and 30, of the distribution between national quotas of the  total volume of catches available to the Community, see Romkes v. Officier van Justitie (Case 46/86)[1987]E.C.R. 2671, 2687–2688, paras.
23 and 24.)
22.
However, the matter at issue in the cases now before the court is not access by vessels of member states to fishing activities in the Community but access by nationals of member states to vessels and to the operation of vessels.
The argument put forward by the member states mentioned above is tantamount to seeking to graft on to the derogation from the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality a second derogation as regards fishing vessels relating to the nationality of the owners or operators of such vessels.
It is based on confusion between the ‘nationality’ of the vessels and the nationality requirements applicable to nationals of the member states and would end up by re-introducing, through the medium of rules applicable to the registration of vessels, discrimination based on the nationality of persons, the prohibition of which constitutes one of the fundamental rules of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
The view that ships are fundamentally different from companies (see paragraph 90 of the report of the hearing in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89)) does not justify discrimination in the field of the ‘nationality’ of vessels between companies and nationals of the member states.
On the contrary, it seems to me to be significant in this context that when, in article 58, the E.E.C.
Treaty defined the companies to which the chapter on the right of establishment was applicable, it adopted, alongside the criterion of formation in accordance with the law of a member state, the criterion of the registered office, central administration or principal place of business and not that of the nationality of the founders, directors or shareholders.
(I would refer in this context to the case law of the court according to which it is the registered office of a company within the meaning of article 48 that serves as the connecting factor with the legal system of a particular state, like nationality in the case of natural persons: see Commission of the European Communities v. France (Case 270/83)[1986]E.C.R. 273, 304, para. 18, and Segers v. Bestuur van de Bedrijfsvereniging voor Bank- en Verzekeringswezen, Groothandel en Vrije Beroepen (Case 79/85)[1986]E.C.R. 2375, 2387, para. 13.)
The United Kingdom therefore cannot argue on the basis of the fact that article 7 can only apply to  discrimination between ships if they are of different ‘nationalities’ in order to justify differences in treatment between natural or legal persons of different nationalities.
As for articles 52 and 221, in as much as they refer to establishment and participation in capital, they can in any event apply only to persons and not to ships.
23.
In sum, I conclude from the whole of the considerations set out above that, whilst international law imposes certain obligations on the member states in point of the registration of vessels, they are fairly vague.
In particular, international law does not define what is to be understood by a ‘genuine link.’
It follows that states may make the exercise of the right of registration subject to particular rules applicable in inter-state relations, such as the provisions of articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
Consequently, I propose that question (1) in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89) should be answered: whilst at present it falls to the member state concerned to determine whether a vessel is entitled to be registered in that state, the member state in question is none the less bound to comply with the relevant principles and provisions of Community law.
2.
The compatibility with Community law, and in particular with articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, of the registration requirements at issue
24.
So as to keep to the order of the questions put by the national court in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89), I shall first consider the compatibility of the registration requirements with Community law, leaving aside any consideration relating to the Community system of fishing quotas.
In any event, reference to the quota system can have no influence on the compatibility with Community law of the registration requirements except as regards the registration of vessels fishing for species subject to quotas.
25.
In order to facilitate consideration of the national court's question (2) it appears advisable to divide it into sections depending on whether it relates to the nationality or the place of residence of the owners and operators (‘operator’ covers charterers, managers or operators within the meaning of section 14(1) (c ) of the Act of 1988), or to the place from which the vessel is operated, and hence to reformulate it as follows:
‘Is it contrary to Community law and in particular to articles 7, 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty for a member state to stipulate the following requirements for registering a fishing vessel in its national register:(a) the owners and operators of the vessel must be citizens of the member state in question or companies incorporated in that state and, in the case of such a company, at least 75 per cent.
of its shares must be owned by citizens of that state or by companies incorporated there and 75 per cent.
of its directors must be citizens of that state;(b) the said owners, operators, shareholders and directors, as the case may be, must be resident and domiciled in that member state and, in the case of a company, it must have its principal place of business there;(c) the vessel must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state?
26.
Before considering these various requirements seriatim, I should like to make four preliminary remarks.
(1) The Commission has raised the First Council Directive of 11 May 1960 for the implementation of article 67 of the E.E.C.
Treaty (Official Journal, English Special Edition 1959–1962, p. 49)(as repealed and replaced with effect from 1 July 1990 by Directive (88/361/E.E.C.)
(Official Journal 1988 No.
L 178, p. 5)), only in connection with the residence requirement laid down for shareholders, and it will therefore be considered only in the context of part (b) of the question as I have reformulated it above.
Moreover, the Commission made no mention of this Directive in its action for failure to fulfil obligations, which relates only to the nationality requirements.
(2) Since the cases before the court are concerned with the taking up of fishing activities by nationals of a member state and the pursuit of those activities in another member state using a vessel registered in that state, article 59 of the E.E.C Treaty on freedom to provide services, which was raised by the Spanish Government, does not seem to me to be applicable.
I consider that, for the provision of a service within the meaning of article 59 to be involved in the sea-fishing sector, there must be an operation carried out by a national established in one member state for a recipient established in another member state by means of a fishing vessel registered in the first state.
(3) In Commission of the European Communities v. Hellenic Republic (Case 305/87)[1989]E.C.R. 1461, 1476–1477, paras.
12 and 13, the court pointed out that
‘the general prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality laid down in article 7 of the [E.E.C.]
Treaty has been implemented, in regard to their several domains, by articles 48, 52 and 59 of the Treaty.
Consequently, any rules incompatible with those provisions are also incompatible with article 7…13.…[which]applies independently only to situations governed by Community law in regard to which the Treaty lays down no specific prohibition of discrimination.
Accordingly, the compatibility of the registration requirements with article 7 of the E.E.C.
Treaty should be considered only in so far as there are situations other than those covered by one or other of the specific provisions at issue here.
27.
As for article 40(3) of the E.E.C.
Treaty, which is raised by the applicants in the main proceedings in Case C 221/89, that provision is merely an expression, specific to the agricultural sector, of the general principle of equality.
The latter principle is broader in scope than the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, which, however, is the only general principle at issue here.
(4) Lastly, reference to article 53 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, which is also prayed in aid by the applicants in the main proceedings in Case C 221/89 and provides:
‘Member states shall not introduce any new restrictions on the right of establishment in their territories of nationals of other member states, save as otherwise provided in this Treaty
no longer adds anything to the general prohibition set out in article 52, since the court has held that, as from the end of the transitional period, article 52 is directly applicable.
28.
Having made these clarifications, let us now consider each of the registration requirements at issue in turn.
(a) The nationality requirements
29.
There can be no doubt that nationality requirements of the type contained in the Act of 1988 are incompatible with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality set out in articles 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty as regards, respectively, the right of establishment and the right of participation in the capital of companies or firms within the meaning of article 58.
In this regard, I fully concur with the Commission's assessments as they are set out in the reports for the hearings (see paragraphs 49 and 50 of the report in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89), ante, pp. 299G — 300A, and paragraphs 21 and 22 of the report in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89)).
As the President of the court observed in paragraph 30 of the order of 10 October 1989 in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89 R)[1989]E.C.R. 3125, 3133:
‘The rights deriving from the above-mentioned provisions of the Treaty include not only the rights of establishment and of participation in the capital of companies or firms but also the right to pursue an economic activity, as the case may be through a company, under the conditions laid down by the legislation of the country of establishment for its own nationals.
Indeed, the second paragraph of article 52 provides:
‘Freedom of establishment shall include the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings, in particular companies or firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of article 58,under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the country where such establishment is effected , subject to the provisions of the chapter relating to capital.’
(Emphasis supplied.)
The first paragraph of article 52 extends the scope of the abolition of the restrictions on freedom of establishment to restrictions on the setting up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any member state established in the territory of any member state.
31.
It follows from that provision, and in particular from the passage which I have emphasised, that it is necessary to reject the United Kingdom's argument that no infringement of article 52 has taken place because the nationality requirements do not prevent nationals of other member states from establishing themselves in the United Kingdom and operating fishing vessels there, but only from doing so under the British flag: British citizens are not subject to that restriction.
I would add that if all the member states made the registration of their fishing vessels subject to residence or domicile requirements of the type laid down in the United Kingdom Act, nationals of other member states established in the United Kingdom would not even be able to carry on any fishing activity under any flag, because they would not be entitled to fly the flag of any member state.
32.
The above also holds goods as regards shareholders and company directors who are nationals of other member states.
Under article 52 they are entitled to set up and manage companies and firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of article 58 under the same conditions as shareholders and directors of British nationality.
33.
As for companies from other member states, which by virtue of the first paragraph of article 58 are equated to natural persons for the purposes of the application of the provisions on the right of establishment, the Act of 1988 deprives them of the right to establish themselves in the United Kingdom through the intermediary of agencies, branches or subsidiaries, since it provides that only companies set up under the laws of the United Kingdom may be owners and operators of fishing vessels, and restricts their right of participation in the capital of companies or firms, as the corresponding right of natural persons is restricted by the Act.
34.
In addition, article 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, which provides that
‘member states shall accord nationals of the other member states the same treatment as their own nationals as regards participation in the capital of companies or firms within the meaning of article 58, without prejudice to the application of the other provisions of this Treaty
prohibits the application of nationality requirements even where the persons concerned do not intend to establish themselves in the United Kingdom.
35.
Lastly, the power vested in the Secretary of State under section 14(4) of the Act of 1988 to dispense with the nationality requirement in the case of one (or more) individuals in view of the length of time he has (or they have) resided in the United Kingdom and been involved in the fishing industry there, is not such as to make the nationality requirements compatible with the E.E.C.
Treaty.
As the Commission has pointed out, it is settled law that the mere fact that the competent authority is empowered to grant exemptions or derogations cannot justify a national measure which is contrary to the E.E.C.
Treaty, even if that power is freely used (see in particular,Openbaar Ministerie of the Netherlands v. van Tiggele (Case 82/77)[1978]E.C.R. 25, 40, para. 19, and Fietje (Case 27/80)[1980]E.C.R. 3839, 3854–3855, para. 14).
36.
It follows from the foregoing considerations that part (a) of question (2) in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89) must be answered in the affirmative: it is contrary to Community law for a member state to stipulate as a requirement for the registration of a fishing vessel in its  national register that the owners and operators of the vessel, whether they be natural or legal persons, or 75 per cent.
of the directors and shareholders of a company owning or operating the vessel, must be nationals of that state, even if the competent national authority has the legal power to dispense with that requirement in the case of certain persons.
37.
Before leaving the question on the nationality requirement, I would also point out in passing that, at the hearing, the Commission agreed that the flag state could stipulate that the captain of the vessel and the mate should have its nationality.
(b) The requirements relating to the residence and domicile of natural persons and the principal place of business of legal persons
38.
As regards the requirements referred to in part(b) of the national court's question (2) as I reformulated it above, it may be noted in limine that the mere fact that fishing activity is carried out, on a self-employed basis, using a fishing vessel registered in a member state does not mean that there is establishment in that state.
This is borne out by the court's judgment in Lopes da Veiga v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (Case 9/88)[1989]E.C.R. 2989, from which it appears that in order for a national of a member state who is permanently employed on board a ship flying the flag of another member state to have the status of a worker/national of a member state who is employed in the territory of another member state, the relationship of employment must exhibit a sufficiently close link with that territory.
In order to decide whether this is so, account must be taken, not only of the fact that the worker is employed on board a vessel registered in the member state in question, but also of other circumstances, such as the fact that he is in the employ of a company incorporated under the law of that state and established there, or the fact that he was hired in that state and that the employment relationship between him and his employer is subject to the law of the flag state, or the fact that he is insured under the social security system of that state and pays income tax there: see pp. 3009–3010, paras.
12–17.
39.
I consider that this must also hold good for the right of establishment: in order for a national of a member state to be eligible to be regarded as exercising his right of establishment in another member state, it is not enough that he should be operating a fishing vessel registered in that state; in addition, his activity must have other links with the territory of that State.
40.
The question is, therefore: what are those other links which a member state, without infringing article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, is entitled to require of a national of another member state who wishes to operate a fishing vessel flying its flag and, in particular, can it stipulate, as the Act of 1988 does, that all the owners and operators of such a vessel and 75 per cent .
of the shareholders and directors of the companies owning or operating the vessel should have their residence and domicile in its territory?
41.
It must be observed that in this case, leaving aside the nationality requirements, the residence and domicile requirements apply without distinction to British citizens and to nationals of other member states.
The Commission, the Spanish Government and the applicants in the main proceedings in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89) argue, however, that even though, formally, those requirements apply in the same way to nationals, they are in reality discriminatory as regards both their objectives and their effects, since the very great majority of British citizens fulfil them automatically.
Admittedly, in Commission of the European Communities v. Italian Republic (Case C 3/88)[1989]E.C.R. 4035, 4059, para. 8, the court expressly confirmed that article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, as a specific embodiment of the principle of equal treatment:
‘prohibits not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result…
42.
However, I take the view that, in the context of the right of establishment, a residence requirement does not necessarily constitute such a criterion of differentiation leading in fact to discrimination on grounds of nationality.
Certainly, a residence requirement which consisted of a requirement to have resided for a certain time in the country before a self-employed occupation could be taken up would involve covert discrimination, because it would be satisfied virtually automatically by nationals and would therefore affect nationals of other member states, if not exclusively, at least chiefly.
43.
The problem arises in different terms, however, where the residence requirement does not have to be satisfied before an occupation is taken up but when it is being pursued.
As Mr. Advocate General Darmon observed in paragraph 3 of his opinion in Reg. v. H.M. 
Treasury, Ex parte Daily Mail and General Trust Plc .
(Case 81/87)[1988]E.C.R. 5483, 5500:
‘establishment within the meaning of the [E.E.C.]
Treaty involves two factors: physical location and the exercise of an economic activity, both, if not on a permanent basis, at least on a durable one.
According to the Council's general programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment (Official Journal, English Special Edition, Second Series IX, p. 7), ‘establishment’ is defined in terms of‘installation en vue d'exercer une activité non salariée sur le territoire d'un Etat membre’(rendered in English as ‘[persons wishing]to establish themselves in order to pursue activities as self-employed persons in a member state’).
44.
However, the right of establishment does not imply only physical location in the country of establishment, but also that this must have taken place with a view to pursuing an economic activity.
According to the court's case law (see, in the context of the free movement of workers,Levin v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (Case 53/81)[1982]E.C.R. 1035, 1058, para. 17;Kempf v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (Case 139/85)[1986]E.C.R. 1741, 1750, para. 10;Brown v. Secretary of State for Scotland (Case 197/86)[1988]E.C.R. 3205, 3244, para. 21 and Bettray v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (Case 344/87)[1989]E.C.R. 1621, 1645, para. 13; and, on a general level, for the definition of ‘economic activities’ within the meaning of article 2 of the E.E.C.
Treaty,Steymann v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (Case 196/87)[1988]E.C.R. 6159, 6173, para. 13), the rules of the E.E.C.
Treaty on the free movement of persons cover only the pursuit of effective and genuine activities, to the exclusion of activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as  purely marginal and ancillary.
The physical presence in the territory of the country of establishment must therefore be such as to enable such effective and genuine activities to be pursued on or from the territory of the country of establishment.
45.
Lastly, it is worth pointing out that that presence in the territory of the country of establishment must be intended to be permanent, or at least of an indefinite duration, because if that were not the case there would be no distinction between establishment and the supply of services.
It is clear from the judgment in the Steymann case, at pp. 6173–6174, paras.
16 and 17, that an activity carried out on a permanent basis or, in any event, without a foreseeable limit to its duration, does not fall within the Commmunity provisions concerning the provision of services, but falls within the scope of articles 48 to 51 or articles 52 to 58 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, depending on the case, and that is  certainly the position where a national of a member state goes to reside in the territory of another member state and establishes his principal residence there.
46.
It follows from the whole of those considerations that every residence requirement is not necessarily contrary to article 52, given that, by definition, the right of establishment entails continuous physical presence in the territory of the country of establishment such as to permit the effective and genuine pursuit of the economic activity in question.
47.
Having said this, I consider that the Commission is right when it argues that to require all owners and operators of British fishing vessels to have their residence in the United Kingdom goes beyond what is permitted under article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
The same applies with even greater reason to the domicile requirement, which, according to the United Kingdom, is a more stringent requirement than mere residence and means living in the member state with the intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.
This is also true of the requirement that 75 per cent.
of directors and shareholders of companies owning or operating fishing vessels registered in the United Kingdom must be resident and domiciled in that country.
48.
There remains the question as to the position where such a vessel belongs wholly to one person.
In this connection, it must be observed that whilst the right of establishment implies physical location in the territory of the country of establishment, it does not require that a person exercising the right should have his residence or, a fortiori, his principal residence or domicile, in the territory of that country.
Such an approach would unduly restrict the right of establishment guaranteed by the E.E.C.
Treaty in as much as it would prevent the exercise of the right of establishment on a secondary basis.
It is settled law, as borne out in particular by Stanton v. Institute National d'Assurances Sociales pour Travailleurs Indépendants (Inesti)(Case 143/87)[1988]E.C.R. 3877, 3894, para. 11, that
‘freedom of establishment is not confined to the right to create a single establishment within the Community, but entails the right to set up and maintain, subject to observance of the relevant professional rules of conduct, more than one place of work within the Community.
49.
As for the requirement for companies which own or operate fishing vessels registered in the United Kingdom to have their principal place of business in the United Kingdom, little needs to be added to that which has already been stated in discussing the nationality requirements.
According to the court's case law, with regard to companies, their seat within the meaning of article 58, that is to say their registered office, central administration or principal place of business, serves as the connecting factor with the legal system of a particular state, as does nationality in the case of legal persons: see Commission of the European Communities v. French Republic (Case 270/83)[1986]E.C.R. 273, 304, para. 18 and Segers v. Bestuur van de Bedrijfsvereniging voor Bank- en Verzekeringswezen, Groothandel en Vrije Beroepen (Case 79/85)[1986]E.C.R. 2375, 2387, paras.
13 and 14.
The court concluded from this in the Segers case, at p. 2387, para. 14:
‘acceptance of the proposition that the member state in which a company seeks to establish itself may freely apply to it a different treatment solely by reason of the fact that its registered office is situated in another member state would thus deprive article 58 of all meaning.
50.
That principle must also be applied here, since to require a company incorporated under the law of one member state, which has its registered office, central administration or principal place of business in that member state (within the meaning of article 58), or even in another member state, to transfer its principal place of business to the member state where a certain activity, such as fishing, is to be carried on, deprives that company of the possibility of exercising its right of establishment through the setting up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries, as is expressly provided for in the second sentence of the first paragraph of article 52.
51.
It can be added, moreover, that a secondary establishment need not necessarily take the form of an agency, branch or subsidiary, but may possibly consist, as the court held in Commission of the European Communities v. Federal Republic Germany (Case 205/84)[1986]E.C.R. 3755, 3801, para. 21:
‘merely of an office managed by the undertaking's own staff or by a person who is independent but authorised to act on a permanent basis for the undertaking, as would be the case with an agency.
52.
For the sake of completeness, I would add that the reference made by the United Kingdom to Robert Fearon & Co.
Ltd. v. The Irish Land Commission (Case 182/83)[1984]E.C.R. 3677, in which the court held to be compatible with article 52 a requirement to reside in Irish territory which was imposed on nationals of other member states, is not relevant.
Apart from the fact that in the Fearon case the residence requirement was not coupled with a nationality requirement, that case can be distinguished on several counts.
First, the residence requirement was imposed on nationals of other member states who had already exercised their right of establishment in Ireland under article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty by setting up a company within the meaning of article 58, whereas in this case the very right of nationals of other member states to take part in the setting up a company in the United Kingdom is restricted by the residence requirement.
Secondly, in the Fearon case it was not the right to exercise an economic activity which was conditional on the shareholders' satisfying the residence requirement, but merely immunity from compulsory acquisition measures adopted under legislation governing the ownership of rural land designed to ensure as far as possible that the land belonged to those who worked it.
Lastly, the residence requirement did not apply to the whole of the national territory but was limited geographically: it was only fulfilled — also in the case of Irish nationals — if the persons concerned lived within three miles of the land in question.
53.
Since the residence and domicile requirements as imposed, in particular, on 75 per cent .
of the shareholders are therefore incompatible with article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, I can deal relatively briefly with the question of their compatibility with the First Council Directive of 11 May 1960 for the implementation of article 67 of the E.E.C.
Treaty (Official Journal, English Special Edition 1959–1962, p. 49), as subsequently amended.
It is noted in passing that the First Directive has been replaced, with effect from 1 July 1990, by Council Directive (88/361/E.E.C.) of 24 June 1988 (Official Journal 1988 No.
L 178, p. 5), which, subject to some limited and temporary derogations, provides for the total abolition of ‘restrictions on movements of capital taking place between persons resident in member states’(article 1), including ‘direct investments on national territory by non-residents’ and ‘acquisition by non-residents of domestic securities not dealt in on a stock exchange’(see points I.A. and III.A. 3 of Annex I to the Directive), which are the operations to which the Commission expressly refers.
But even under the First Directive, as amended in particular by Directive (86/566/E.E.C.) of 17 November 1986 (Official Journal 1986 No.
L 332, p. 22), there was no doubt that residence and domicile requirements imposed on shareholders were unlawful.
The fact that the First Directive was formally concerned only with restrictions on foreign exchange transactions did not prevent the court, in Brugnoni v. Cassa di Risparmio di Genova e Imperia (Case 157/85)[1986]E.C.R. 2013, 2030, para. 22, from applying it to any kind of obstacles constituting a ‘hindrance’ to the widest liberalisation of those capital movements which the First Directive sought to liberalise in full.
Admittedly, the Brugnoni case is concerned with article 2(1) of the First Directive, which provided for the grant of general authorisations in respect of the capital movements set out in list B of Annex I, and Directive (85/566/E.E.C.) repealed that article and merged list B with list A referred to in article 1(1), under which member states are to grant all foreign exchange authorisations required.
However, this makes no difference to what has been stated above, since the judgment in the Brugnoni case is based, as the Commission points out, on the general objective of the First Directive in so far as it applies to transactions with the Directive liberalised, and it is clear from Commission of the European Communities v. Hellenic Republic (Case 194/84)[1987]E.C.R. 4737, 4750, para. 9, that capital movements set out in list A also benefit from ‘unconditional liberalisation.’
54.
For all those reasons, part (b) of question (2) in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89), as I have reformulated it, must also be answered in the affirmative.
In other words, it is contrary to Community law for a member state to lay down as a requirement for registration that the owners, operators, shareholders and directors, as the case may be must reside and be domiciled in that member state and, in the case of a company, that it must have its principal place of business there.
(c) The requirement relating to the place of management, direction and control of the vessel
55.
Under section 14(1) (b ) of the Act of 1988, a fishing vessel may be registered in the new register only if it ‘is managed, and its  operations are directed and controlled, from within the United Kingdom.’
56.
It is clear from the more general observations which I have set out with regard to the actual concept of establishment within the meaning of the E.E.C.
Treaty that that requirement is compatible with article 52 of the Treaty.
As I have already stated, establishment entails continuous, physical presence in the territory of the country of establishment and the effective and genuine pursuit, on or from that territory, of the economic activity in question, even in the case of sea fishing.
57.
The Commission points out that, in is communication of 19 July 1989 on a Community framework for access to fishing quotas (Official Journal 1989 No.
C 224, p. 3), it agreed that it was lawful to require undertakings operating fishing vessels to maintain a representation on shore in the flag state.
I consider it worth setting out in extenso the Commission's position in that regard as it is set out in paragraph 3.1 of the communication:
‘Whether a fishing vessel is operated by a company or an individual, the responsibility of the operator must be traceable through some real and continuous representation at the main base of operations concerned.
Such representation must take the form of an onshore administrative unit of the undertaking, commensurate with the size of the latter and operating with responsibility for the technical and commercial management of the fishing vessels concerned (manning, wages, welfare benefits, leave, taxation, repairs, ships' supplies, etc.).
The Commission added (see section 8.1 of the Commission's written observations in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89)) in the context of the present cases:
‘In this context the member state may also require a person appointed by the owner or operator of the vessel to be resident in its territory so as to be legally responsible for the operations of that administrative unit and the management of the fishing vessel concerned.
58.
I consider that all those methods of presence or representation in the territory of the flag member state are not only justified from the point of view of the Community system of fishing quotas, but they are also indissociable from the actual exercise of the right of establishment in the sea fishing sector.
There cannot be ‘establishment without establishment.’
59.
This does not mean that the ‘base of operations’ cannot receive general directives from the owners of the vessel residing in another member state or from a company having its registered office, central administration or principal place of business in another member state.
In my view, the requirement at issue as it is worded does not in itself rule this out: it is the vessel which has to be operated from within the United Kingdom and it is its use , that is to say the operations of the vessel, which must be directed and controlled from the United Kingdom; this does not prevent the onshore unit responsible for the actual management of the vessel (whether it be in the form of a subsidiary, a branch, an agency or an administrative unit) from being subject to the general control of the natural or legal person who set it up.
60.
Lastly, I consider that, by virtue of the same principles, a member state may, if it wishes, stipulate that vessels wishing to fly its flag must undertake to operate habitually from a port in that country.
61.
In other words, the obligation which the court accepted as permissible in the context of the quota system in paragraph 28 et seq.
of Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193, 222 et seq.
is also valid as a requirement for entitlement to registration, since it is an indissociable principle of the very concept of establishment.
62.
Part (c) of question (2), as I reformulated it, must therefore be answered in the negative: it is not contrary to Community law for a member state to make the grant of its flag subject to the requirement that the vessel must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state.
3.
The Community system of fishing quotas
63.
In its question (3) in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89) the national court asks whether the answer to question (2) is affected by ‘the existence of national catch quotas allocated to member states pursuant to the Common Fisheries Policy.’
The United Kingdom and the Governments of several other member states consider that, if national measures of the type at issue were to be contrary to the articles of the E.E.C.
Treaty considered above, they would nevertheless be justified from the point of view of the Community system of fishing quotas and its objectives.
64.
I would recall that the court ruled in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. [1990]2 Q.B.
193, 226:
‘Community law as it now stands…does not preclude a member state, in authorising one of its vessels to fish against national quotas, from laying down conditions designed to ensure that the vessel has a real economic link with that state if that link concerns only the relations between that vessel's fishing operations and the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries;…
The court reached that conclusion after holding that the quota system established by Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83 constituted a derogation from the general rule of equal conditions of access to fishery resources laid down in article 2(1) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76: see paragraph 24 of the judgment, at pp. 221–222.
65.
In Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. , at p. 222, para. 25 the court stated that
‘Consequently, the measures which the member states may adopt when exercising the power conferred on them by article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/82 with a view to excluding certain of the vessels flying their flag from sharing in the utilisation of their national quota are justified only if they are suitable and necessary for attaining the aim of the quotas…
which
‘is to assure to each member state a share of the Community's total allowable catch, determined essentially on the basis of the catches from which traditional fishing activities, the local populations dependent on fisheries and related industries of that member state benefited before the quota system was established.’
(See p. 221, para. 23.)
66.
However, it is debatable whether the judgment in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. , and the judgment of the same date in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Agegate Ltd.
(Case C 3/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
151, are of any relevance to the cases now before the court.
In those judgments the court expressly left aside the question whether the conditions at issue were in conformity with Community law in relation to fishing not subject to quotas (see paragraph 11 of the judgment in Ex parte Agegate Ltd. [1990]2 Q.B.
151, 185–186 and paragraph 12 of the judgment in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. [1990]2 Q.B.
193, 219), and limited its examination to whether and to what extent Community law permitted a member state to determine, by means of such conditions, those vessels in its fishing fleet which were to be allowed to fish against its national quota.
However, the Act of 1988 does not govern access to quotas but the registration of fishing vessels and therefore affects access to all sea-fishing activities, including fishing for species not subject to quotas.
67.
Secondly, the member states' power to exclude certain vessels from sharing in the utilisation of their national quota, as recognised by the court in paragraph 25 of the judgment in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. , at p. 222, stems from article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83, which provides:
‘Member states shall determine, in accordance with the applicable Community provisions, the detailed rules for the utilisation of the quotas allocated to them.
That power can be exercised only with regard to vessels flying the flag of the member state concerned or registered there.
Consequently, requirements for the registration of fishing vessels (even though they may determine, in the same way as conditions for the grant of licences, access to fishing activities, including fishing for species subject to quotas) do not constitute measures for the management of national quotas within the meaning of article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83.
Moreover, if they were, in themselves, to constitute measures relating to the conservation of fishery resources (which, in the light of paragraph 11 of the judgment in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, 107, is very doubtful in the case of requirements relating to the characteristics of the natural or legal persons who are the owners of the fishing vessels), they would fall ‘fully and definitively’ within the competence of the Community (see the judgment in the Pesca Valentia case, at pp. 106–107, para. 10) and hence the member states could adopt them on the basis of an express and clear delegation of powers.
68.
I consider in the light of the foregoing that a reference to the objectives of the Community system of quotas cannot be used to justify national rules on the registration of fishing vessels, even if those rules were applicable only to vessels intended to fish for species subject to quotas.
69.
If my understanding is correct, that was also the conclusion expressed by the Commission in its written observations in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89), which were submitted before the judgments in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. and Ex parte Agegate Ltd. were delivered.
However, in its reply in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89), which was lodged after the judgments were delivered, the Commission discussed the compatibility of the nationality requirements with Community law also in the light of those judgments, that is to say in relation to the aims of the quota system.
I would therefore also give my views on this aspect in case the court should consider that the registration  requirements are capable of constituting ‘detailed rules for the utilisation of the quotas’ within the meaning of article 5(2) of Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 170/83.
70.
In the judgment in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Agegate Ltd.
(Case C 3/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
151, 188, para. 25, the court held that a requirement for 75 per cent.
of the vessel's crew, irrespective of their nationality, to reside ashore in the member state in question was irrelevant to the aim of the quota system and could not therefore be justified by that aim.
In all logic, therefore, the court must, a fortiori, reach the same conclusion with regard to the nationality requirements at issue here.
To restrict access to national quotas to fishing vessels which are owned, chartered, managed or operated by nationals, be they natural or legal persons, is neither ‘suitable’ nor ‘necessary’in order to enable the local populations dependent on fisheries and related industries to benefit from the quotas.
In my opinion in Ex parte Agegate Ltd. , the fact that the residence requirement was applicable to British citizens and nationals of other member states alike was the main element in the reasoning which led me to take the view, unlike the court, that that requirement was compatible with Community law: see para. 57.
I remain of the view, moreover, that since the quotas were introduced in order to safeguard the interests of local populations dependent on fishing, it is legitimate to require the majority (and even 75 per cent.) of crew members of vessels fishing for species subject to quotas to be ordinarily resident on the coast of the country in question.
The residence requirement at issue in Ex parte Agegate Ltd. did not include the latter stipulation, although, to my mind, it was implicit therein.
Perhaps the court would have accepted it had that stipulation been explicit.
71.
However, since the court held that a requirement that the crew reside on shore in the member state in question was not related to the aim of the quota system, no reason can be seen which might induce the court to take the view that residence and domicile requirements imposed on all owners and operators of fishing vessels and on 75 per cent.
of shareholders and directors of companies owning or operating such vessels may be so related.
72.
Moreover, when the court accepted, in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.
(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193, that a member state might make the right of its fishing vessels to fish against national quotas subject to those vessels' having a real economic link with that state, it took care expressly to stipulate that the link had to concern only the relations between that vessel's fishing operations and the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries: see p. 222, para. 27.
Moreover, it was ‘in view of that very narrow definition of the link which a member state may require when authorising a vessel to fish against its quotas’(see p. 225, para. 44) that the court considered that there was no need to answer the second part of question 1(d) in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. and hence held that certain economic, financial and fiscal evidence was irrelevant in order to establish the existence of a real economic link between the vessel and the member state in question, such as, for example ‘the fact that the companies owning or managing the fishing vessels concerned are incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, that they are subject to corporation tax and value added tax in the United Kingdom…’
(p. 224, para. 42).
No more than the fact that a company owning a fishing vessel is incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom does the fact that it has its principal place of business in the United Kingdom and that 75 per cent.
of its shareholders and directors reside and are domiciled there serve to prove the existence of a real economic link  between the operations of the vessel and the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries.
The same must be true of the residence and domicile of natural persons owning fishing vessels.
A fortiori, the requirement for all owners to reside and be domiciled in the United Kingdom cannot be justified in the light of the aims of the quota system.
73.
It must, moreover, be noted that the only requirement which the court held to be justified under the quota system in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. concerned precisely the operations of the vessels.
The requirement was for vessels to operate habitually from a national port (p. 222, para. 28) and, hence, for vessels to be present at national ports with a certain frequency (p. 224, para. 40).
As I have already stated, I consider that that rule is merely a manifestation of the more general rule that the vessel must be operated from the flag state and that its use must be directed and controlled from the territory of that state.
Hence, the primary justification for that requirement is to be found in the very concept of establishment, even though it may, in addition, be justified under the quota system.
74.
Ireland, for its part, argued that the requirements at issue were justified under article 56(1) of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
However, it must be borne in mind that, according to the case law of the court:
‘As an exception to a fundamental principle of the Treaty, article 56 of the Treaty must be interpreted in such a way that its effects are limited to that which is necessary in order to protect the interests which it seeks to safeguard.’
(Bond van Adverteerders v. The Netherlands (Case 352/85)[1988]E.C.R. 2085, 2135, para. 36.)
Even if the protection of the rights of local fishing communities were capable of falling within the concept of public policy for the purposes of article 56(1), it must be held that it follows from what has been stated above that the nationality, residence and domicile requirements are disproportionate to that objective.
75.
In conclusion I propose that the court should state, in answer to question (3) raised in Case C 221/89, that the existence of the system of national quotas does not alter the answers given to question (2).
4.
The application of the requirements at issue to fishing vessels previously registered in the old register
76.
In its question (4) referred to the court for a preliminary ruling in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89), the national court seeks essentially to establish whether the principle of legitimate expectation precludes the introduction of new registration conditions such as those at issue from having the effect that fishing vessels duly registered in a member state have their registration withdrawn and hence their right to fish and to fish against the catch quotas allocated to that member state.
77.
Logically, that question is otiose as regards the nationality and residence requirements if the court rules, as I suggest it should, that those requirements are in any event contrary to Community law.
78.
From its wording, the question does not seem to relate to the requirement for vessels to be operated from within the flag state but merely to the case where, following the introduction of new registration requirements, a vessel loses its flag because the owners and operators are nationals of other member states and are resident and domiciled in those states.
79.
In order to avoid any misunderstanding I would add, however, that since the requirement for the vessel to be operated from the national territory is indissociable from the very concept of establishment, its formal introduction could not constitute an infringement of anyone's legitimate expectations.
In addition, it should be observed that although the Act of 1988 entered into force on 1 December 1988, the validity of registrations effected under the former system was extended by section 13 until 31 March 1989, and hence owners and operators who might not have fulfilled that requirement in the past were given a reasonable transitional period in which to comply therewith.
80.
Accordingly, rather than declaring that question (4) in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89) has become otiose, I propose that the court should answer it in the negative.
Conclusion
81.
In the light of all the considerations set out above I propose that the court should rule as follows in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89).
(1) Whilst at present it falls to the member state concerned to determine whether a vessel is entitled to be registered in that state, the member state in question is none the less bound to comply with the relevant principles and provisions of Community law.
(2)(a) It is contrary to Community law for a member state to stipulate as a requirement for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register that the owners and operators of the vessel, whether they be natural or legal persons, or 75 per cent.
of the directors and shareholders of a company owning or operating the vessel must be nationals of the state, even if the competent national authority has the legal power to dispense with that requirement in the case of certain persons;(b) it is contrary to Community law for a member state to lay down as a requirement for registration that the owners, operators, shareholders and directors, as the case may be, must reside and be domiciled in that member state and, in the case of a company, that it must have its principal place of business there; and (c) it is not contrary to Community law for a member state to make the grant of its flag subject to the requirement that the vessel must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state.
(3) The existence of the system of national quotas does not alter the answers given to question (2).
(4) The matters adverted to in question (4) do not affect the answers given to questions (2) and (3).
82.
It follows from those answers that the Commission's action against the United Kingdom for failure to fulfil its obligations is well founded and hence the court should declare in Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89) that, by imposing the nationality requirements enshrined in sections 13 and 14 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, the United Kingdom has failed to fulfil its obligations under articles 52 and 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
83.
As for the costs in the Factortame case (Case C 221/89), it should be held that the costs incurred by the Kingdom of Belgium, the Commission of the European Communities, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, which have submitted observations to the court, are not recoverable.
Since the proceedings are, in so far as the parties to the main proceedings are concerned, in the nature of a step in the proceedings pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
84.
As far as Commission of the European Communities v. United Kingdom (Case C 246/89) is concerned, the United Kingdom must be ordered to pay all the costs, including those of the Kingdom of Spain, which intervened in support of the Commission's conclusions, but with the exception of the costs incurred by Ireland, which intervened in support of the United Kingdom.
25 July 1991.
The following judgment was delivered in open court in Luxembourg.
1.
By order dated 10 March 1989, which was received at the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 17 July 1989, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen's Bench Division, referred to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling under article 177 of the E.E.C.
Treaty four questions on the interpretation of provisions of Community law governing, in particular, the right of establishment and of the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, with a view to determining the compatibility with Community law of national legislation laying down the conditions for the registration of fishing vessels.
2.
The questions were raised in proceedings brought against the Secretary of State for Transport by Factortame Ltd. and other companies incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, and also the directors and shareholders of those companies, most of whom are Spanish nationals (hereinafter together referred to as ‘the applicants in the main proceedings’).
3.
According to the documents before the court, the applicants in the main proceedings are the owners or operators of 95 fishing vessels which were registered in the register of British vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894.
Of those vessels, 53 were originally registered in Spain and flew the Spanish flag, but on various dates as from 1980 they were registered in the British register.
The remaining 42 vessels have always been registered in the United Kingdom, but were purchased by the companies in question on various dates, mainly since 1983.
4.
The statutory system governing the registration of British fishing vessels was radically altered by Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations 1988.
It is common ground that the United Kingdom amended the previous legislation in order to put a stop to the practice known as ‘quota hopping’ whereby, according to the United Kingdom, its fishing quotas are ‘plundered’by vessels flying the British flag but lacking any genuine link with the United Kingdom.
5.
The Act of 1988 provided for the establishment of a new register in which thereafter all British fishing vessels were to be registered, including those which were already registered in the old general register maintained under the Act of 1894.
However, only fishing vessels fulfilling the conditions laid down in section 14 of the Act of 1988 could be registered in the new register.
6.
Section 14(1) provided that, subject to dispensations to be determined by the Secretary of State for Transport, a fishing vessel was eligible to be registered in the new register only if
‘(a ) the vessel is British-owned;(b ) the vessel is managed, and its operations are directed and controlled, from within the United Kingdom; and (c ) any charterer, manager or operator of the vessel is a qualified person or company.
According to section 14(2), a fishing vessel was deemed to be British-owned if the legal title to the vessel was vested wholly in one or more qualified persons or companies and the vessel was beneficially owned by one or more qualified companies or, as to not less than 75 per cent., by one or more qualified persons.
According to section 14(7), ‘qualified person’ meant a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom, and ‘qualified company’meant a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and having its principal place of business there, at least 75 per cent.
of its shares being owned by one or more qualified persons or companies and at least 75 per cent.
of its directors being qualified persons.
7.
Lastly, under section 14(4), the Secretary of State for Transport could dispense with the nationality condition in the case of an individual in view of the length of time he had resided in the United Kingdom and been involved in the fishing industry of the United Kingdom.
8.
The Act and Regulations of 1988 came into force on 1 December 1988.
However, under section 13 of the Act of 1988, the validity of registrations effected under the previous Act was extended for a transitional period until 31 March 1989.
9.
At the time of the institution of the main proceedings, the applicants' 95 fishing vessels failed to satisfy one or more of the conditions for registration under section 14 of the Act of 1988 and thus could not be registered in the new register.
10.
Since those vessels were to be deprived of the right to engage in fishing as from 1 April 1989, the companies in question challenged the compatibility of Part II of the Act of 1988 with Community law by means of an application for judicial review brought before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen's Bench Division, on 16 December 1988.
11.
In order to resolve that dispute the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, referred the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:
‘(1) Does Community law affect the conditions under which a member state lays down rules for determining which vessels are entitled to register in that state, to fly its flag and carry its nationality?
‘(2) In the light of the provisions and principles of Community law and in particular(but without limitation) the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, the right of establishment and the requirement of proportionality, is a member state entitled to stipulate that in order to be registered in and entitled to fly the flag of that member state, a fishing vessel:(a ) must have its legal title vested as to 100 per cent .
in citizens of that member state, resident and domiciled therein, or vested in a company at least 75 per cent.
of the shares [of]which are legally and beneficially owned by such persons and of which at least 75 per cent.
of the directors are such persons (hereinafter called ‘a qualified company’); and (b ) must be beneficially owned as to at least 75 per cent.
by citizens of that member state resident and domiciled therein, or as to 100 per cent.
by one or more qualified companies, or as to part by one or more qualified companies, provided that citizens of that member state, resident and domiciled therein, hold at least 75 per cent.
of the remaining property in the vessel; and (c ) must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state; and (d ) must have as its charterer, manager or operator, a citizen of that member state, resident and domiciled therein, or a qualified company, in circumstances where no exception is made in respect of nationals of other member states, save that the member state has power to dispense with the nationality requirement in respect of an individual in view of the length of time such individual has resided in the member state and has been involved in the fishing industry of the member state?
‘(3) Is the answer to question (2) affected by the existence of national catch quotas allocated to member states pursuant to the Common Fisheries Policy?
‘(4) Are the answers to questions (2) and (3) affected by the fact that the measure in question has been introduced with the object and effect of rendering a number of fishing vessels which immediately prior to the date of such measure coming into effect have been duly registered in and licensed to fish by the member state in question and which are to a substantial extent beneficially owned by nationals of another member state, resident and domiciled in that other member state, ineligible to fly the flag of the first member state with the result that they cease to be eligible to fish against the catch quotas allocated to the first member state under the Common Fisheries Policy unless ownership and management of the vessels are transferred to citizens of the first member state resident and domiciled therein in accordance with the provisions of the said measure?
12.
Reference is made to the report for the hearing for a fuller account of the facts in the proceedings before the national court, the course of the procedure and the written observations submitted to the Court of Justice, which are mentioned or discussed hereinafter only in so far as is necessary for the reasoning of the court.
Question (1)
13.
It must be observed in the first place that, as Community law stands at present, competence to determine the conditions for the registration of vessels is vested in the member states.
As far as fishing vessels in particular are concerned, the court held in Pesca Valentia Ltd. v. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Case 223/86)[1988]E.C.R. 83, 107, para. 13 that the provisions of Council Regulation (E.E.C.) No. 101/76 of 19 January 1976 laying down a common structural policy for the fishing industry (Official Journal 1976 No.
L 20, p. 19) referred to fishing vessels ‘flying the flag’ of a member state or ‘registered’there, but left those terms to be defined in the legislation of the member states.
14.
Nevertheless, powers which are retained by the member states must be exercised consistently with Community law: see most recently Hellenic Republic v. Commission of the European Communities (Case 57/86)[1988]E.C.R. 2855, 2872, para. 9, and Commission of the European Communities v. Hellenic Republic (Case 127/87)[1988]E.C.R. 3333, 3348, para. 7.
15.
The United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Belgium and the Hellenic Republic argue, however, that the position is different when it comes to the competence of each state under public international law to define as it thinks fit the conditions upon which it grants to a vessel the right to fly its flag.
They refer in that connection to article 5(1) of the Geneva Convention of 29 April 1958 on the High Seas, which reads:
‘Each state shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag.
Ships have the nationality of the state whose flag they are entitled to fly.
There must exist a genuine link between the state and the ship; in particular, the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.
16.
That argument might have some merit only if the requirements laid down by Community law with regard to the exercise by the member states of the powers which they retained with regard to the registration of vessels conflicted with the rules of international law.
17.
Consequently, the answer to question (1) must be that, as Community law stands at present, it is for the member states to determine, in accordance with the general rules of international law, the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the member states must comply with the rules of Community law.
Question (2)
18.
By this question, the national court asks whether the three conditions to which the Act of 1988 makes the registration of fishing vessels subject in the United Kingdom are compatible with Community law.
It must therefore be construed as follows.
(i) Must Community law and, in particular, the principles of freedom of establishment, non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and proportionality be interpreted as precluding a member state from stipulating as conditions for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register:(a ) that the legal owners and beneficial owners and the charterers, managers and operators of the vessel must be nationals of that member state or companies incorporated in that member state, and that, in the latter case, at least 75 per cent .
of the shares in the company must be owned by nationals of that member state or by companies fulfilling the same requirements and 75 per cent.
of the directors of the company must be nationals of that member state;(b ) that the said legal owners and beneficial owners, charterers, managers, operators, shareholders and directors, as the case may be, must be resident and domiciled in that member state;(c ) that the vessel in question must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state?(ii) Is the answer to question (i) above different where the power exists to dispense with the nationality requirement in respect of an individual in view of the length of time such individual has resided in the member state in question and has been involved in the fishing industry of that member state?
The nationality, residence and domicile requirements (paragraph (i)(a) and (b) of the national court's question (2), as reformulated above)
19.
At the hearing, the Commission of the European Communities argued that the registration of a vessel constituted in itself an act of establishment within the meaning of articles 52 et seq.
of the E.E.C.
Treaty and that therefore the rules on freedom of establishment were applicable.
20.
It must be observed in that regard that the concept of establishment within the meaning of articles 52 et seq.
of the E.E.C.
Treaty involves the actual pursuit of an economic activity through a fixed establishment in another member state for an indefinite period.
21.
Consequently, the registration of a vessel does not necessarily involve establishment within the meaning of the E.E.C.
Treaty, in particular where the vessel is not used to pursue an economic activity or where the application for registration is made by or on behalf of a person who is not established, and has no intention of becoming established, in the state concerned.
22.
However, where the vessel constitutes an instrument for pursuing an economic activity which involves a fixed establishment in the member state concerned, the registration of that vessel cannot be dissociated from the exercise of the freedom of establishment.
23.
It follows that the conditions laid down for the registration of vessels must not form an obstacle to freedom of establishment within the meaning of articles 52 et seq.
of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
24.
The United Kingdom and Belgium argue, however, that the registration of a vessel in a member state is not a conditio sine qua non of establishment in that state, since natural persons or companies are not precluded from operating vessels, even fishing vessels, for instance from the United Kingdom, in the context of operations linked to the territory of that state; establishment in the United Kingdom in that way would be possible in respect of any vessel registered in one of the other member states.
25.
That argument cannot be upheld.
According to the second paragraph of article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, freedom of establishment includes, in the case of nationals of a member state:
‘the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons…under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the country where such establishment is effected…
26.
The United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark and Greece consider that the E.E.C.
Treaty does not preclude a nationality requirement of the type at issue in the main proceedings, because discrimination on grounds of nationality can arise only where, under the law of a member state, persons are treated differently on account of their nationality.
In contrast, in this case, what is involved is not discriminatory treatment on grounds of nationality but a condition for the grant of nationality, and the member states are free to determine to whom they will grant or refuse their nationality, in the case of natural persons and ships alike.
27.
In that connection, it must be observed that the concept of the ‘nationality’ of ships, which are not persons, is different from that of the ‘nationality’of natural persons.
28.
The prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality, which is set out in particular, as regards the right of establishment, in article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, is concerned with differences of treatment as between natural persons who are nationals of member states and as between companies which are treated in the same way as such persons by virtue of article 58.
29.
Consequently, in exercising its powers for the purposes of defining the conditions for the grant of its ‘nationality’ to a ship, each member state must comply with the prohibition of discrimination against nationals of member states on grounds of their nationality.
30.
It follows from the foregoing that a condition of the type at issue in the main proceedings, which stipulates that where a vessel is owned or chartered by natural persons they must be of a particular nationality, and where it is owned or chartered by a company the shareholders and directors must be of that nationality, is contrary to article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty.
31.
Such a condition is also contrary to article 221 of the E.E.C.
Treaty, under which member states must accord nationals of the other member states the same treatment as their own nationals as regards participation in the capital of companies or firms within the meaning of article 58.
32.
As for the requirement for the owners, charterers, managers and operators of the vessel and, in the case of a company, the shareholders and directors, to be resident and domiciled in the member state in which the vessel is to be registered, it must be held that such a requirement, which is not justified by the rights and obligations created by the grant of a national flag to a vessel, results in discrimination on grounds of nationality.
The great majority of nationals of the member state in question are resident and domiciled in that state and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other member states would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to that state in order to comply with the requirements of its legislation.
It follows that such a requirement is contrary to article 52.
33.
It follows from the foregoing that it is contrary to the provisions of Community law and, in particular, to article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty for a member state to stipulate as conditions for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register:(a) that the legal owners and beneficial owners and the charterers, managers and operators of the vessel must be nationals of that member state or companies incorporated in that member state, and that, in the latter case, at least 75 per cent.
of the shares in the company must be owned by nationals of that member state or by companies fulfilling the same requirements and 75 per cent.
of the directors of the company must be nationals of that member state; and (b) that such legal owners and beneficial owners, charterers, managers, operators, shareholders and directors, as the case may be, must be resident and domiciled in that member state.
The condition relating to the place of operation, direction and control of the vessel (paragraph (i)(c) of question (2), as reformulated)
34.
In this regard, it is sufficient to point out that a requirement for the registration of a vessel to the effect that it must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within the member state in which it is to be registered essentially coincides with the actual concept of establishment within the meaning of articles 52 et seq.
of the E.E.C.
Treaty, which implies a fixed establishment.
It follows that those articles, which enshrine the very concept of freedom of establishment, cannot be interpreted as precluding such a requirement.
35.
Such a requirement, however, would not be compatible with those provisions if it had to be interpreted as precluding registration in the event that a secondary establishment or the centre for directing the operations of the vessel in the member state in which the vessel was to be registered acted on instructions from a decision-taking centre located in the member state of the principal establishment.
36.
Consequently, the reply to the national court must be that it is not contrary to Community law for a member state to stipulate as a condition for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register that the vessel in question must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state.
The possibility of a dispensation from the nationality requirement (paragraph (ii) of question (2), as reformulated)
37.
This part of the question essentially asks whether the fact that the competent minister of a member state has the power to dispense with the nationality requirement in respect of an individual in view of the length of time such individual has resided in that member state and has been involved in the fishing industry of that member state can justify, in regard to Community law, the rule under which registration of a fishing vessel is subject to a nationality requirement and a requirement as to residence and domicile.
38.
It must be pointed out in this connection that, as the court has consistently held, the mere fact that the competent authority is empowered to grant exemptions or dispensations cannot justify a national measure which is contrary to the E.E.C.
Treaty, even if the power in question is in fact freely applied: see, in particular Openbaar Ministerie of the Netherlands v. van Tiggele (Case 82/77)[1978]E.C.R. 25 and Criminal proceedings against Anton Adriaan Fietje (Case 27/80)[1980]E.C.R. 3839.
39.
Consequently, the answer to be given to the national court must be that the fact that the competent minister of a member state has the power to dispense with the nationality requirement in respect of an individual in view of the length of time such individual has resided in that member state and has been involved in the fishing industry of that member state cannot justify, in regard to Community law, the rule under which registration of a fishing vessel is subject to a nationality requirement and a requirement as to residence and domicile.
Question (3)
40.
It must be recalled in the first place that in Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Agegate Ltd.
(Case C 3/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
151 and Reg. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Jaderow Ltd.(Case C 216/87)[1990]2 Q.B.
193 the court held that, when exercising the power granted to them to define the detailed rules for the utilisation of their quotas, the member states could determine which vessels in their fishing fleets would be allowed to fish against their national quotas, provided that the criteria employed were compatible with Community law.
In the judgment in Ex parte Jaderow Ltd. the court ruled, inter alia, that a member state might lay down conditions designed to ensure that the vessel had a real economic link with that state if that link concerned only the relations between that vessel's fishing operations and the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries.
41.
Secondly, it must be observed that it is not the purpose of national legislation governing the registration of vessels, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, to define the detailed rules for the utilisation of quotas.
Consequently, whatever the objectives pursued by the national legislature, such legislation cannot be justified by the existence of a Community system of national quotas.
42.
The reply to question (3) must therefore be that the existence of the present system of national quotas does not affect the replies given to question (2).
Question(4)
43.
Question (4) is to be answered in the event that the court should consider that Community law does not preclude nationality, residence and domicile requirements of the type at issue in the main proceedings.
Since that is not the case, there is no need to give a ruling on question (4).
Costs
44.
The costs incurred by the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, Ireland and the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted observations to the court, are not recoverable.
Since these proceedings are, in so far as the parties to the main proceedings are concerned, in the nature of a step in the proceedings pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
On those grounds, the court in reply to the questions referred to it for a preliminary ruling by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen's Bench Division, by order of 10 March 1989, hereby rules:
(1) As Community law stands at present, it is for the member states to determine, in accordance with the general rules of international law, the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the member states must comply with the rules of Community law.
(2) It is contrary to the provisions of Community law and, in particular, to article 52 of the E.E.C.
Treaty for a member state to stipulate as conditions for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register:(a) that the legal owners and beneficial owners and the charterers, managers and operators of the vessel must be nationals of that member state or companies incorporated in that member state, and that, in the latter case, at least 75 per cent.
of the shares in the company must be owned by nationals of that member state or by companies fulfilling the same requirements and 75 per cent.
of the directors of the company must be nationals of that member state; and (b) that the said legal owners and beneficial owners, charterers, managers, operators, shareholders and directors, as the case may be, must be resident and domiciled in that member state.
(3) It is not contrary to Community law for a member state to stipulate as a condition for the registration of a fishing vessel in its national register that the vessel in question must be managed and its operations directed and controlled from within that member state.
(4) The fact that the competent minister of a member state has the power to dispense with the nationality requirement in respect of an individual in view of the length of time such individual has resided in that member state and has been involved in the fishing industry of that member state cannot justify, in regard to Community law, the rule under which registration of a fishing vessel is subject to a nationality requirement and a requirement as to residence and domicile.
(5) The existence of the present system of national quotas does not affect the replies given to question (2).
