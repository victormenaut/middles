Right can you have a look  at those  Just have at the answers to this.
Did you find any difficulties at all?
N no I don't .
It looks all right from here.
Yeah.
Keep the tracing paper if you need it.
That's all right.
yes that's okay that's fine.
Hang on.
Oh yes alright from there.
How did you come to that conclusion?
What ?
the petrol station   the petrol station, isn't it?
Mm.
Mm  five minutes.
It's five minutes and fifteen.
I misread the .
That's okay.
in the first fifteen minutes of the journey   Yeah er    What's fifteen minutes  as part of an hour?
Quarter of a hour.
Quarter of an hour.
That's point two five.
Mm.
You can't
Mm.
You can't have time as a decimal, time is not a decimal.
Mm.
Okay?
I can't remember what it's called it's in sixties whatever that is.
Mhm.
Yeah.
S Time is not a decimal so you can't operate time as a decimal.
Nobody ever used to make that mistake at one time you know why?
No.
Because everything worked was wasn't in decimal.
Mm.
All the distances were in twelves 
Mm.
and for and weights were in fourteens so 
Aha.
nobody ever thought about anything being a decimal.
Mhm.
So nobody had any problems with that.
No of course that everything's de- you know everything's decimal time
Yeah.
becomes quite an awkward calculation.
It didn't used to be.
It didn't.   not been interrupted.
same constant speed.
So you work the same the constant speed.
.
Yeah w shouldn't matter ,
yeah.
that's fine.
Aha.
Doesn't make any difference at all that doesn't.
Erm so you would have done  er yeah then you've got You've got your speed of distance over time correctly.
Mm.
Or time is distance over speed.
It's all right, but  you've then  gone that's not nought point two five minutes the speed's per hour.
Isn't it?
Mm.
The speed is per hour  isn't it?
So that would have been  point two five which should have been fifteen minutes.
Yes that's sixtieth of an hour 
Which is point two five of an hour.
Be very careful with your 
Mm.
units.
Yeah.
That's
Mm.
The calculation's fine what you've done's fine just mucked 
Put the wrong 
the units up.
Yeah.
Right?
So that's  How many minutes earlier?
Now you've not done that you've actually done his journey time .
Mm.
Mm?
So careful read the question.
You must read the question!
Alright, how're you getting on with them?
Or have I stopped you?
Didn't know what I'm supposed to be doing with that .
Your supposed to be doing them rotate them through Do this one first.
How do you mean  them?
Hundred and eighty degree rotation around C.
doing it Do you mean drawing it on Using this drawing it?
Yeah.
You've done rotations and reflections and so forth haven't you?
Mm.
Mhm.
that rotated a hundred and eighty degrees about that.
Mm.
brought it by  isn't it?
But I know what to do I don't know what you want me to do.
I want it I want it shown as a hundred and eighty degree rotation.
There's an exam question  Rotate that
Yeah.
about that point the hu Through a hundred and eighty degrees .
Mm.
four.
What your not so  Fine.
Yeah.
Okay yes good.
That's alright.
Use the patterns to write down  the A three.
A Three is that that that that that.
A four    Lets have a look.
Is it done?
No I haven't done anything yet I'm on .
Look
I can't do it!
I can't .
You haven't done rotations have you?
Yeah I have but I don't how to do them like this I've not seen it been d drawn out like that.
Right draw something from the centre of rotation to the the figure.
Mm.
Rotate that bit through a hundred and eighty degrees where's it go?
Over here.
Over there.
There's a hundred 
Yes.
and eighty innit?
Trace the original.
Yes.
Mm.
Round the centre of rotation  it to the spoke while she's up the other spoke.
 Dum.
Mm.
Mm?
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
it's as simple as that.
Isn't it?
.
Go on then.
as if you've drawn.
Have you got a pencil?
No I was looking at the other one.
No I want it actually done I want you 
 
to physically do 'em .
Right erm 
So they go into your brain
Mm.
via your eyes and and 
 
finger ends and so forth.
Mhm.
Okay?
Mhm.
I suppose I should put  Nyah Right okay simultaneous equations.
Yeah.
With some degree of er  success I trust this time.
I think I messed number one up.
Ah dear.
Yes you did.
You know why?
No.
You made the classic mistake the only mistake there is here you multiply everything by two
Mm.
So that's twenty six.
Mm.
That's the only I mean that's th that's the real problem with this thing It's one the the difficulties you end up with You see you must remember to multiply everything that's there by the number you want to multiply, not just half of it.
And that's all the problem is.
I think I've done the others right.
Yes that looks alright.
Yeah.
Well you can always tell can't you?
How do you tell?
St st st just stick 
Go back and check it  
the numbers back in.
Just put the numbers back in.
Yeah it's alright.
Yeah it's alright.
You see you managed to  plough through these quite r readily did you?
Sort of.
Ah.
What on earth's that question?
Two A plus
Oh it's an A is it?
Oh I beg your pardon sorry
I changed it to  .
That's al that's alright that's alright I'm with that.
I understand what you're doing it's a substitution.
It's a little like As and Bs.
Er it doesn't make any difference does it?
No but I'm used to Xs and Ys.
Yes but A Yeah that's alright erm except for examples  we where do up to?
Ten.
Up to ten.
Yes.
Have a go at fourteen and sixteen.
Whilst I sit here and admire your expertise and 
Ha.
general  facility at this subject.
Mm.
And say to yourself
Nine seven nine C plus 
Yep.
Or four Y minus minus nine.
Yeah.
Which is probably as good.
Thirteen.
Thirteen is right.
twenty six 
That's okay.
Y equals 
Y equals  What're you gonna do?
Divide it.
Yeah, whoa.
Right it's two isn't it?
Mm.
Okay.
Substitute that back in .
Yes that's right.
Yes.
Do number seventeen.
But I haven't done sixteen.
Just do number seventeen I fancy seventeen better than number sixteen.
Mhm, you would.
I know.
I have this great in-built desire to make people suffer.


There's an easier way of doing it isn't there?
What get rid of the Ys?
Yes.
Mm.
Suppose so.
Yeah there is is There's an awful lot of suppose so about that you only gonna do one set of calculations rather than two aren't you?
Yeah.
You must look at this from the minimum of Point of view of the minimum amount of labour.
Yeah.
Equals twenty six.
No it doesn't.
I beg your pardon yes it does..
Mm.
Yes it does.
You're right.
   

That's right.
and X equals 
Thirty three.
Yeah.
Alright we  need to bother a I know you I know you can do substitution.
Yeah thing about it is though when you're looking at this, you wanna be looking as to which is the Produces the smallest numbers.
mm.
And which produces the minimum amount of manipulation and that was that the second one wasn't it?
Yeah.
You had much less to do than anything else.
Mm.
Right that's unfortunate.
That I l I've forgotten to bring the other work.
However.
Can I Can I just interrupt and say I've forgotten .
I'm sorry is that enough?
Yes.
thank you.
Eye's funny.
Yeah.
Now look it asks you for a certain number of things It says As The average doesn't it?
How 
Yes.
Do you work t an average?
Average is all the tests added together
Yeah,
divide by the number of tests he had.
That's right.
So what's the total for all his test?
Hundred and twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six how many tests had he had?
X.
X.
So the average is going to be?
Hundred and twenty five divide by x.
Hundred an Is it a hundred and twenty five?
twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six divided by X is that.
Yeah.
So what's difficult about that?
Nothing.
So.
Now there's another two tests.
Yeah.
So what's the total now?
Hundred and twenty eight  divide by
Where's a hundred and twenty eight come from?
What's the total marks for the next two tests?
Oh.
You're told what the marks are for the next two tests aren 
Oh nine and eight.
Nine and eight aren't they?
Yeah.
So what's the total marks for the Now for the the tests?
How many marks you got all together?
Hundred and   twenty thirty  forty   forty two .
Mm.
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
No!
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
Come on what's nine add six ?
Hundred and thirty six.
O What's nine add six?
Eleven.
Nine add six?
Oh  Fourteen.
And another one.
Six 
fifteen yeah?
Yes.
Six and nine it's always one less when innit when you're adding nine?
So it's fifteen do it's a hundred and twenty six plus nine is?
hundred and thirty forty.
I want a hundred and twenty six plus nine!
Oh a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty  five.
Hundred and thirty five.
What's five and eight?
Not
Thirteen.
Thirteen so the answer's gonna be a hundred and?
Forty three.
Hundred and forty three.
You know what the a en end number's gonna be every time i Don't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Hundred and forty three.
That's right so the total's a hundred and forty three.
So what's the what's the average gonna be or even the mean?
Hundred and forty three  divide by 
By 
X plus two.
Splendid.
Can we have it written down like real mathematicians?
Ah wonderful.
Wonderful.
hundred and forty five.
Yes No I said a hundred and forty 
Forty three 
three yes.
Over 
Divide by X plus two .
plus two that's right.
Now what's the next part of the question say?
If if a If his average for the first X test was one greater than his average for
X plus two tests .
plus two tests .
Use results of one and two 
To form the equation and find the value of X. 
Now what it just said  think of another way of saying that.
Work out what X is.
No you can't work out what X is you haven't got a c hope of working out wh 
Form an equation.
Form an equation.
But what's one side of the equation going to be?
Hundred and twenty six divide by X.
Plus?
Hundred and fort 
No no
plus two
No no read what it says.
If his average for the first X tests is one greater than the average  Sorry beg your pardon I've got it round me  round me neck.
If his average for the first X t is one greater than his average for the X plus two tests   So a hundred and twenty six over X is gonna equal?
What he got in the first
O in the second lot  isn't it?
Plus one.
Mm.
Yes.
So right it down.
Yeah come on!
Just write it down!
Hundred and twen 
What?
What I've just told you hundred and twenty six over X is equal?
Hundred and forty three 
Three 
divide by X plus two
Yeah.
Plus one.
Yes.
Plus one.
Why is it plus one there?
Cos it's says it's This is one more than that isn't it?
This is one more than that.
So shouldn't that be plus one?
How do you make them equal?
Oh yeah.
Yes think about it carefully.
How do you make them equal.
Mm.
That's right so.
Now what are you going to do?
Find the value of X.
I'm an extremely patient soul as you well know,but if you say Find the value of X to me again How are you gonna  find the value of X?
What do you intend to do?
Get rid of the denominators.
Get rid of the denominators, good.
Well done.
Go on then.
Is that right?
No.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
Timesing it by X.
Alright then times it by X.
Go on then if that's what you're doing go on.
Keep going!
Hold on a minute you've still got a this on the bottom haven't you?
To start with come on.
Cos your multiplying by X go on you haven't cancelled it yet go on.
Carry on.
  

Eh?
What are you doing?
You can't do that!
Why?
Multiply everything by X go on.
Ju just do every term you've got multiply it by X.
Go on.
I don't know how to do it though.
Course you do!
Just carry on multiplying things by X instead of trying to jump to conclusions.
Where's the two X come from?
Times it by 
But you've got that over th on the bottom haven't you?
It's X plus two there, isn't it?
It's got nothing to do when multiplying You're multiplying the top by X go on.
That's better.
 
That's right perfect.
Go on then, get some stuff cancelled out.
That's right.
No.
There's no way you can do that.
But I've got an X on the top.
Aye but you've got an X plus two on the bottom.
So if I put X minus two on the top?
No it will not cancel.
Why not?
You've got a hundred and forty three X over X plus two, haven't you?
Hundred and forty three minus two.
Hundred and forty does not work.
There's no way that works at all.
Just do what you've got there.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
That's right, equals.
Hundred and forty three X over  X plus two.
That's right.
Plus X.
That's perfect now what are you going to do?
Can I move across That across to this side?
You can multiply everything through by X plus two, yes.
Go on.
  

Bracket, X plus two never mind about this s Mm.
Equals  that plus  Come on you're multiplying by X plus two.
No  you're multiplying by X plus two.
You've missed a You've now dropped a plus sign out haven't you?
And you've dropped an X out.
Why?
You're multiplying this term by X plus two aren't you?
You're 
Mm.
gonna multiply everything by X plus X plus two.
It just so happens that if multiply this term by X plus two you get rid of the X plus two at the bottom don't you?
Mm.
But everything there It's the same thing as when you were doing this.
The simultaneous equations wasn't it?
Why was it?
You had to me s make sure that you multiply every term out, haven't you?
Yeah.
So here you've got to multiply every term out.
Do not forget that that is a term on its own it's got n connected to this yet.
No.
You're a very very careful about that so start getting it tidied up then.
Expand the brackets I think is probably the best thing.
Hundred and twenty six X 
S X that's right.
Plus two hundred and fifty two.
Equals
Hundred and forty three X 
X 
Plus
X squared  
X squared plus two X.
That's right.
Right now things are getting a bit better aren't they?
Come on!
What're you gonna do now?
Do all the Xs on one side.
Well I'd collect the things together that were the same for a start I think.
What d'you mean?
Well you've got some Xs to collect together haven't you?
Oh.
Mm?
That's better.
That's simplified it.
Yeah.
Now s You can start you've still gotta get the every I would get everything over to one side of the equals sign.
Why?
What's this ?
Then use your quadratic  .
This is a quadratic isn't it?
Yes good.
Does it matter which way you put it?
Well I always like to read it from left to right but it doesn't matter really.
Yeah but I mean
you can do that if you want to.
I would have put all the  the er
Hundred and forty five X minus hundred and twenty six X .
Yes.
Plus x squared  minus two five two 
Minus two five two.
Equals nothing.
Yes.
So that's going to be 
Don't look at me like that!
Nineteen X.
Mhm.
Plus X squared.
Yeah.
Minus two five two .
minus two five two Equals nothing .
Equals nothing that's right.
Now if you're gonna do this you really want it in the form of X squared first don't you?really to make it To make  the thing easy to work, aren't you?
Well that's gonna be your A.
Yeah it is.
B and that's gonna be C .
It's much be It's much better to see it as A square As X squared plus te nineteen X plus minus two two five, really.
Two five two equals nothing.
Right.
Formula.
I don't know.
You're gonna have some tremendously large numbers if you work the formula aren't you?
Yes.
I mean B squared's nineteen squares you know just under four hundred isn't it?
That's twenty times twenty.
 
You imagine four times that.
A lot.
It's a lot isn't it?
But they're only numbers.
that's true.
But perhaps it's easier I wonder what are other factors of two hundred and fifty two?
One.
One and two hundred and fifty two, yes very good yes.
Two.
Yes good.
We want a difference of nineteen somewhere don't we?
That's easy.
We drop the calculator everywhere.
Well you can drop the calculator if you want it would be better if you pick 'em up and stick the  numbers in.
How're you gonna do?
Two hundred and fifty two divide by nineteen.
What you got?
Thirteen point two six three one five 
Yes.
seven nine eight.
Yes.
I don't think that's right.
Try the square root of two five two.
Fifteen point eight seven four five  
Yes yes ,a difference.
Don't know  does sixteen go into it just try sixteen into two five two.
Fifteen point seven five.
So we want something like erm  Seven and sixteen, well that doesn't work Sorry seven and twenty six.
Is that right?
No.
How about
No, gives a difference of nineteen.
Use the formula then, we're just sitting here wasting time.


Minus nineteen  or minus B plus or minus the square root of B 
Minus B 
Plus or minus
plus or minus the square root of 
the square root of B squared
plus 
No.
Minus 
Minus two B C
Minus four A C

All over
Two A.
Two A is right.
So what's A?
It's an X!
Must be true.
Yes.
I am delighted you agree.
Yeah.
Minus nineteen
Yes.
plus or minus
The square root of nineteen squared minus four times

Lovely.
All over 
Over two
Two times one.
Yep.
X squared.
X equals not X squared.
Minus nineteen  plus or minus 
plus or minus Can I do that 
Root 
all in one?
Yeah!
I can do it on here, oops!
Hope so.
Square root of nineteen squared minus four times times minus 
Minus 
two five two.
Answer.
Nineteen squared's three hundred and ninety ninety one I think.
Mm.
Three hundred and sixty one.
Really?
Three sixty one times  eight thousand There's summat wrong.
Nineteen squared minus four times one 
No it's minus It's plus It's nineteen squared plus eight  nought  one nought nought eight.
Mm.
Four time two five two.
Two hundred and fifty times four is a thousand Two hundred and fift 
It's minus!
It's minus times a minus  Isn't it?
Four
four times two th two five two is one thousand and eight isn't it?
Yes.
Two fifty times four is a thousand.
So two five two times four is t one thousand and eight, plus three hundred and chunkety chunk Three hundred and sixty one.
Mm.
Which is one three six nine.
That's more like it.
Yeah but what about mm.
above answer.
Mm.
What about that?
Where do  get that from?
Because what you did was you did er nineteen squared
Yes.
minus four.
I don't know why I don't how that works 
Would that be in brackets?
Of course it is.
I didn't put a brackets there.
Well you would have to although I would have though it might have worked algebraically that's certainly wrong though.
What did we say?
One three six  nine .
Nine.
One three six nine, yes.
All over 
Er you want the square root of that.
that's it all over two.
Two.
Yep, so it's minus nineteen plus or minus 
Plus or minus 
root one three six nine.
Square root 
One three six nine.
That's interesting.
Ah!
 
Yes go on.
Yeah it is isn't it?
Yes.
Go on then.
You'll remember that.
I will.
Thirty seven.
So the f One answer is f fourteen 
Don't!
Just don't!
It's not actually.
One answer's nine innit?
Minus nought point five?
Yeah.
And the other answer is?
Can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five, how you managed to produce  that?
Don't know.
Minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator  must be about eighteen mustn't it?
Mm.
The difference between thirty seven and nineteen's about eighteen innit?
Approximately?
Divide that by two, answer?
Nine.
Nine.
Mm.
Engage brain  Th You must regard a calculator 
 
with the greatest and gravest of suspicion.
Cos it's not actually working algebraic that calculator at the present moment I don't know what you've got it programmed in What you've got it at but it's not working algebraic.
Now it might work.


No unless we have to Minus nineteen minus thirty seven divide by two minus twenty eight?
Yeah that's better.
I wonder if  minus.
Wait you've got minus fifty six haven't you here? this is minus fifty six if you use your brain.
And divided by two is minus twenty eight.
Yeah.
Yes minus twenty eight.
Now if you You take the difference between nineteen and thirty seven you get the answer eighteen don't you?
Yes.
You divide that by two you get the answer nine .
Nine.
Mm.
But why isn't my calculator working?
Because you haven't got it in the correct mode it's not working algebraic.
Which is in what function?
Who knows what your calculator and that's a such a wonderful piece of work that.
Yeah but  
Scie Scientific or You want it in scientific mode if it says scientific
Yeah it does.
In that case use it in scientific and then it will work that way.
Will it?
Yeah well it should do.
Anyway.
.
Okay.
Let's read the second part of this question cos it's taken us er quite some time to do it but excellent question.
Hasn't it 
Right 
Right let's read the second part of this.
It has an average of thirteen point five marks for the first X plus one tests.
His mark on the last test gave him a final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
What was his marks for the last test.
How do you work out his total marks for his X plus one tests.
Thirteen point five divided by X plus one.
That's his No no you've got his average as thirteen point five haven't you?
How do you work out his total marks which is what we're really looking for?
Times X plus
Yes, it's thirteen point five times X plus one.
And how do you work out his total marks for his X plus two tests?
Fourteen times thirteen plus two.
No no no.
Why?
Fourteen times what?
Times X plus  two.
Yeah.
That's what I said!
Was it?
I'm sorry I misheard you.
So what it's alright.
Mm.
I misheard you okay?
Mm.
So, it might be a good idea to write that down and work it out.
Thirteen point five
Yes
times
Will you stop doing that!
What?
That!
What's wrong with it?
How do you write a multiplication in algebra?
You're gonna multiply that by X plus one aren't you?
Mm.
How do you write that?
Hundred and thirty five X plus one.
Bracket.
X plus one.
X plus one.
Ha?
Suppose so.
That's how you write it.
Minus fourteen
Never mind about this silliness, that 
 
you've been allowed to get away with.
Right go and work them out then.
Thirteen point five times one is?
Thirteen point five innit?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
Okay.
So what's your total marks?
Sorry what's the difference?
Fourteen point five.
You know what he total mark for  his X plus one test was don't you?
Mm.
And you know the total mark was X plus two tests.
It actually asks you for the mark he obtained for his final tests doesn't it?
Yeah.
So if you take two away, one from the other, you'll have the mark
Nought point five.
for his test won't you?
So you'll have nought point five X plus?
Plus 
Point about it is y you can't see it, can you unless you've got it written down so write it down.
it's thirteen well it's fourteen X isn't it?
Mm.
Plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Or minus thirteen X plus thirteen point five isn't it?
Why is it?
Well you're taking the difference between the two aren't you?
So don't you just minus them?
Yeah.
So that's fourteen X plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Yes?
Mm.
So that's nought point five X, now what?
Plus 
 
Plus what's the difference here?
Hundred and thir Hundred 
What's twenty eight minus thirteen point five?
Oh it's point five!
Yes.
 

What's twenty eight minus thirteen poin 
Fourteen point five.
Fourteen point five.
 

Okay.
So wouldn't 
That's 
you times it by two?
Another student has his average as thirteen point five marks for the first blah blah blah, right.
Which marks for the last test give a final average of fourteen marks for   So the one test is gonna give him that isn't it?
That's right you agree isn't it?
That's his total marks for X plus one tests, is there.
Total marks for S plus plus two tests is there.
The actual mark  is that.
That's for his nought  nought point five X.
So to get those two up to one X  
up to one X you should times by two which is twenty nine.
Which I don't believe.
Well do you times it by four?
No give   but his mark on his last test gave him the final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
So that's his total there and his total there.
Yes it's gonna be doubled hasn't it to give you that?
Oh!
Oh dear!
How daft can you get?
What's the value of X?
W we worked that out somewhere didn't we?
We did didn't we?
Oh!


Oh!
Nearly as bad as .
Dear oh dear!
Eh?
Oh.
Innit?
I'm very tired .
So what do you do?
Times thirteen point five X by
Well you do thirteen point five times ten if you want.
Yes.
And fourteen times eleven.
Why eleven?
Well nine plus two is eleven isn't it?
Yes.
Hundred and fifty four.
Now who is being dormant?
And you've got it haven't you?
Then you find the difference?
Yes.
That makes sense.
actually work here hasn't it?
Does that give you the same answer?
Yes it should do.
Let's just check it go on.
You had thirteen point five times ten which I think is a hundred and thirty five in normal circumstances.
Yes.
And a hundred and f fourteen times eleven.
Go on it's a hundred and fifty four.
Minus nineteen.
No minus a hundred and thirty five.
One fifty four minus hundred and thirty five.
Nineteen.
Nineteen.

Five X plus two Y not just five x two Y.
Plus two Y.
Five X plus two Y.
Wonderful.
  
Go on 
the average  cost per box in terms of X and Y.
So what's the average b cost per box gonna be?five X plus two Y you better write that down before our brains refuse to accept any more information.
Two Y is the total cost, how do you find the average?

Add them together and divide by the number you've got.
How many have you got.
Five.
No you haven't.

Total cost.
Total of boxes you mean.
Total cost.
Five's the total number of boxes but that the top one's the total cost isn't it?

Which is the Dutch which is that half.
Well,later he sold his three boxes of Dutch cigars at a profit of thirty three of their cost.
Mm?
So 
So that's three X divided by
No it's not three X divided by five, it's says of their cost.
Thy cost three X didn't they?
Yes.
And the sold them for a third profit so what did he sell them for?
X plus a third.
If he sold the things for 
Four 
thirt Aye.
Four thirds.
No.
I if 
If he's got 
he bought them for three quid?
Yes.

Yes.
In the days when a gold sovereign meant something when you went abroad 
Yes.
And he sold them that was his cost was three pounds.
And he h He sold them at a profit of thirty three and a third percent which is a third.
