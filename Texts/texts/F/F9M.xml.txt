Man to Man
Macho man
Can't cook
Macho man
Can't sew
Macho man
Eats plenty Red Meat,
At home him is King,
From front garden to back garden
From de lift to de balcony
Him a supreme Master,
Controller.
Food mus ready
On time,
Cloth mus ready
On time,
Woman mus ready
On time,
How Macho can yu go?
Cum
Talk to me bout sexuality,
Cum meditate,
Cum Save de Whale,
Dose bulging muscles need Tai Chi 
Yu drunken eyes need herb tea,
Cum, Relax.
Macho man
Can't cook, sew or wash him pants,
But Macho Man is in full control.
Dis Poetry
Dis poetry is like a riddim dat drops
De tongue fires a riddim dat shoots like shots
Dis poetry is designed fe rantin
Dance hall style, Big mouth chanting,
Dis poetry nar put yu to sleep
Preaching follow me
Like yu is blind sheep,
Dis poetry is not Party Political
Not designed fe dose who are critical.
Dis poetry is wid me when I gu to me bed
It gets into me Dreadlocks
It lingers around me head
Dis poetry goes wid me as I pedal me bike
I've tried Shakespeare, Respect due dere
But dis is de stuff I like.
Dis poetry is not afraid of going ina book
Still dis poetry need ears fe hear an eyes fe hav a look
Dis poetry is Verbal Riddim, no big words involved
An if I hav a problem de riddim gets it solved,
I've tried to be more Romantic, it does nu good for me
So I tek a Reggae Riddim an build me poetry,
I could try be more personal
But you've heard it all before,
Pages of written words not needed
Brain has many words in store,
Yu could call dis poetry Dub Ranting
De tongue plays a beat
De body starts skanking,
Dis poetry is quick an childish
Dis poetry is fe de wise an foolish,
Anybody can do it fe free,
Dis poetry is fe yu an me,
Don't stretch yu imagination
Dis poetry is fe de good of de Nation,
Chant,
In de morning


I chant In de night
I chant In de darkness
An under de spotlight,
I pass thru University
I pass thru Sociology
An den I got a Dread degree
In Dreadfull Ghettology.
Dis poetry stays wid me when I run or walk
An when I am talking to meself in poetry I talk,
Dis poetry is wid me,
Below me an above,
Dis poetry's from inside me
It goes to yu

A writer rants
Write a rant about de runnings
Writer rant about de runnings
So I wrote of fires bunning
An de judgement dat is cuming.
It is part of our tradition
It's our fighters ammunition,
Give it schools fe education
It may start sum luv creation.
Real life business did provoke it
Den I went around an spoke it.
It has cum from off de bookshelf
It's alive so hear it yourself,
An echo came to me an said
‘Yu have a job yu mus do, dread,
Write a rant of our short-cumings,
Writer rant about de runnings!’
Money
(rant)
Money mek a Rich man feel like a Big man
It mek a Poor man feel like a Hooligan
A One Parent family feels like some ruffians
An dose who hav it don't seem to care a damn,
Money meks yu friend become yu enemy
Yu start see tings very superficially
Yu life is lived very artificially
Unlike dose who live in Poverty.
Money inflates yu ego
But money brings yu down
Money causes problems anywea money is found,
Food is what we need, food is necessary,
Mek me grow my food
An dem can eat dem money.
Money meks a singer singaloada crap
Money keeps horses running round de track
Money meks Marriages
Money meks Divorce
Money meks a Student tink about de course,
Money meks commercials
Commercials mek money
If yu don't hav money yu just watch more TV,
Money can save us
Still we feel doomed,
Plenty money burns ina Nuclear Mushroom.
Money can't mek yu happy
Money can't help yu when yu die,
It seems dat dose who hav it continually live a lie.
Children a dying
Spies a spying
Refugees a fleeing
Politicians a lying,
So deals are done
An webs are spun
Loans keep de Third World on de run,
An de Bredda feels betta dan dis Bredda next door


Cause dis Bredda's got money, but de Bredda's got more
An de Bredda tinks dis Bredda's not a Bredda cause he's poor
So dis Bredda kills de odder
Dat is Economic War.
New world Economic War
A bigga economic war means
It may not be de East an de West anymore
Now its de North an de South
Third World fall out
Coffee an Oil is what its about
It's Economic War
Poor people hav de scar
Shots fired from de Stock Market floor,
So we work fe a living, how we try
An we try,
Wid so little time fe chilling
Like we living a lie.
Money meks a dream become reality
Money meks real life like a fantasy
Money has a habit of going to de head
I have some fe a rainy day underneath me bed,
Money problems mek it hard fe relax
Money meks it difficult fe get down to de facts
Money meks yu worship vanity an lies
Money is a drug wid legal eyes
Economists cum
Economists go
Yu try controlling yu cash flow
Food cost loads
House prices soar
An de Rich people try to dress like de Poor,
Nobody really understands de interest rate
When dere is interest den its all too late,
We cherish education
But how much do we pay?
Yu can't buy Race Relations or afford a holiday
Money can't mek yu happy, yu happiness is paper thin
When yu are lonely yu will invite yu poor friends in.


Now dem sey is money culture time
Is dis culture yours, cause it is not mine
Money culture who?
Money culture what?
Money culture thrives where luv is not,
Dem can buy an sell till dem gu to Hell
Dem can tax de wisher at de wishing well,
Now Frankenstein cum fe privatise
Empire fools, get penny wise.
Every government will tek what dem can get
Every government is quick to feget
Every government can mek money by killing
Every government luvs money, no kidding,
But money is paper an paper will burn
So tink about trees as yu earn,
It could do good but it does more bad
Money is fake and
You've been had.
Some study how fe manage it
Some study how fe spend it
Some people jus cannot comprehend it
Some study how fe move it from one country to another
Some study how fe study it an dem study fe ever,
Some people never see it yet dem work hard
Other never see it because dem carry cards,
Some people will grab it without nu thanks
An den mek it pile up in High Street banks.
Parents are hoping,
Some are not coping,
Some are jus managing,
Books need balancing,
Property is theft,
Nu money means death,
Yu pay fe yu rent den nothing left,
Some will pick a pocket
Some are paid fe stop it
Dose who are paid fe stop it are happy
Cause dey got it,
Some gu out an fight fe it
Some claim dem hav de right to it
People like me Granparents live long but never sight it.


Money made me gu out an rob
Den it made me gu looking fe a job,
Money made de Nurse an de Doctor immigrate
Money buys friends yu luv to hate,
Money made Slavery seem alright
Money brought de Bible an de Bible shone de ligh
No rights red an half dead
Dem drag him to de police van
An it was broad daylight,
Dem kick him down de street to it,
I knew it was not right,
His nose had moved, bloody head,
It was a ugly sight.
Dem beat him, tried fe mek him still
But him put up a fight.
De press were dere fe pictures
Cameras roll an click.
While dem get dem money's worth
I started fe feel sick.
No rights red an half dead
An losing breath real quick.
I was sure dat it was caused by
Some bad politrick.
Down de road dem speed away
All traffic pulls aside,
Next to me a high class girl said
‘Hope they whip his hide.’
Under me a young man's blood
Caused me fe slip an slide,
He pissed his well-pressed pants,
A man like me jus cried.
All de time it happens
Yes, it happens all de time
But ‘Helping with Enquiries’
Says newspaper headlines.
If yu don't help wid enquiries
Yu mus be doing fine,
An if yu tink yu seeing justice
Yu mus be bloody blind.

The Cold War
When me fingers feel not dere
An me Dreadlocks feel like hair
I tell meself dat Englan's not fe me,
Breathing car fumes as I jog
On de Motorway thru fog
I dream of somewhere else I wanna be,
When de tears me cry quick freeze
An me tremble at de knees
I tell meself dis is no way fe grow,
When me nose gets snotty
An me cannot feel me botty
I get de feeling it is time fe go.
I do not find snow charming
Rain may help some farming
But I can deal wid rain if dere is heat,
I am no sunbather
Just a Roots, Rock, Rap, Dub Raver
I like wearing sandals on me feet,
I don't call it chilly
When I got a frozen willy
I call it de Ice Age, Death or Hell,
When me cat keeps crying
An few birds are flying
I wish I had a working wishing well.
I am a natural naturist
I am sure I am sun kissed
I am hooked, I am a displaced Sun addict,
Colds me only phobia
Sunshine is me Utopia
I never miss de winter fe one bit,
I wait an wait till it gets warmer
Cost me hundreds at de sauna
If its winter outdoor sports, feget me baby,
I like it really hot
Then I can do a lot
When I am freezing I get cramp an I go crazy.


Some like a little shiver
Some like a freezing river
Some like to throw a snowball
At a mate,
Some like to go an ski
Rather dem dan me
Cum frosty times I want to emigrate,
I am trying to fit in
When yu see me icy grin
I am sure you'll see de reason for de rhyme,
Yes I am still here
Cause hot or cold but everywhere
You'll see people from afar
An dey are mine.
As a African
As a African I danced to riddims wild in Nicaragua
I overstood dem well.
As a African I did not celebrate 200 years of Australia,
I overstand its history is black.
As a African I went to find Palestine,
I got confused on de West Bank,
An as a African Palestine is important.
As a African I grew old,
I went an sat down wid an reasoned wid Mr Ayatollah.
Mr Ayatollah told me fe mind me own business,
An so did Mr President USA.
Mrs Thatcher didn't even talk to me.
As a African a plastic bullet hit me in Northern Ireland.
But me children overstood an dey grew strong,
As a African I was a woman in a man's world,
A man in a computer world,
A fly on de wall of China,
A Rastafarian diplomat,
An a miner in Wales.
I was a red hot Eskimo,
A peace luvin hippie,
A honest newscaster,
A city dwelling peasant,
I was a Arawak,
A unwanted baby,
A circumcised lady,
I was all a dis
An still a African.
My God!
Your God!
So dis is de state dat your kind dreamt about,
An after yu beating is dis yu way out,
Cause I was a witness, now I want to shout,
Explain to me, who is YOUR GOD?
Yu dreamt of a homeland, well others dream too,
De fruit was forbidden an now yu can't chew,
How can yu do dis, in de past it was you,
Is dis in de name of YOUR GOD?
Does YOUR GOD love children
Does YOUR GOD love peace
Could YOUR GOD bring justice to de Middle East,
Does YOUR GOD love anyone whatever dere kind,
Is YOUR GOD dis brutal, or is YOUR GOD blind,
An is YOUR GOD willing to talk to a nation,
Or did YOUR GOD come here to wipe out creation
My questions are childlike but I'm in confusion,
My question is,
Where is YOUR GOD?
A Picture of a Sign
I saw a picture of a sign
It was a sign of de time
Saying,
‘No Blacks, No Irish, No Dogs,
No Children, No Cats, No Wogs.’
Sey what,
Dat greeted me Mudder
In de Mudder country?
Nowadays
Dem couldn't leave dat message fe me.
I saw a picture of a Policeman
Beating a Bredda,
As a lesson on progress
Me show it to me Mudder.
Me Mudder sey ‘What
Is PC Dixon dat’
Me sey,
‘Mum dat is dat
Dats de Mudder country
Plenty a shout tit fe tat
An try raise a family.’
I saw a picture of a man
Trying hard,
Very thin,
Homeless, moneyless,
One more starving,
De Credit Legacy
Hopeless in Chelsea,
De Mudder countrys home
Of de New Age Yuppie.
I saw a picture of meself
In me British Passport,
An me tink of all de people
Dat de British hav fought,
Like ‘De Blacks, de Irish, de Dogs,
De Children, de Cats and de Wogs.’


Now de Mudder country is down
On her knee,
She is tough and quite persistent,
But I picture some ting different.
Yo Bowy
Lets boogie.
Sell yu soul
Prostitute yu Art
Be a Black
An White
Minstrel.
Wave yu hands Bowy
Show yu teeth
Strut dat funky ting
Sing Bowy, sing.
Boss won't touch yu
Wid a barge pole
But Bowy
Yu sexy
Dance Bowy, dance.
Top of de Pops
Flash locks
Flash flesh
Get down Bowy
Weigh down.
Good stuff
Wonderful riddims
Don't worry
Be happy.
Get Rich quick
If not
It's a job.
Tiananmen Square
Rumours were spreading round Moscow
Rumours around de Whitehouse
Rumours were spreading round London city
A nations crying out,
As de rumours were confirmed
De press were gathered dere
An all conscious people were saying
Our hearts at Tiananmen Square.
Singing an chanting an dancing
All fe a little more say
Courage hope an comradeship
De order of de day,
Young blood, young minds, new ideas
Dere was nu stopping some
An dere was nu sign of de devastation yet fe come.
Could de people shoot de people
Would de people really dare
Could de people do such evil
Well dey did such evil dare,
Bad vibes an bodies burning nonsense in de atmosphere
De tanks dey work so hard fe build
Spill blood on Tiananmen Square.
Leff, right, all over people crying out fe change
Reform or revolution somehow tings mus rearrange
Uncle Sam is not de man yu tink dem fighting fe McDonalds
Don't believe de News at Ten, dese people seek new channels,
Great Baton yu great hypocrite, talk of democracy?
Chinese people hav nu vote in yu Chinese colony,
Power to de people, yu can't kill an idea,
All dose dat die exposing lies
Now live in Tiananmen Square.
Royals do it too
De Press haz gone krazzy
De message is blur,
If butting an maybees
An many not sures,
De truth is so vital
No comment upstairs,
She swore on de Bible,
He swore dat he cares.
I heard from a neighbour
I heard from a cop
It's talk on de corner
It's cheap in de shop,
Astrologers knew it
It's palace endorsed
In public dey split
It's a Royal Divorce,
A royal divorce, a royal divorce
It really upsetted de cute royal horse,
A royal divorce, a royal divorce
I got de facts from a well unknown source.
How could she do it?
An how does he feel?,
Is dere no make-up kit
It's so unreal,
Raised in de House
It's de talk of de Nation,
What of dere Spouse
An dere organisation?,
My Mum is worried
She said ‘It's de times,
It should be studied
By experts on crime’,
Zoom in an focus
Let's see what is dere,
Is it dem, is it us
Or a Royal Affair?


A royal affair, a royal affair
Could it be royals also need a spare,
A royal affair, we speculate here
But wasn't she seen wid a big  millionaire ?
She was so busy
Never at home,
He's in de Navy
De kids are alone,
Well can yu blame her
She could need some luv,
He's just a soldier
Nu time for a dub,
Nu time fe kissing
He's ready fe war,
Now dey are splitting
She'll drive her own car,
De Family vex
It's all over de place
Nu more royal sex
It's a royal disgrace.
A royal disgrace, a royal disgrace
Dey should hav been happy,
Dey both had dere space
A royal disgrace, I followed de case
It's thrilling an killing
An all in good taste.
Dey are our role models
Our figureheads
Dey should not squabble
But live in fast stead,
Dey should be perfect
It's not good enough
Study dere subjects
Cause real life is tuff,
But royals are not real
Dere bigger dan us
If dey burn a meal
We can all mek a fuss
It's tuff an heavy
Dey could not go de course


By royal degree
It's a royal divorce
A royal divorce, a royal divorce
Real life together cannot work by force
A royal divorce, a royal divorce
I'm so unhappy,
I'm joking of course.
Black Whole
I can't be a Non-European
I am whole
No Non,
European is Non-Black?
Female is Non-Male?
Oxygen Non-Matter?
I an I live
If you non me
No wonder
You Non-Compassionate.
Non-European
Who is?
Non-Westerners
Are North, South an East.
Rapid Rapping
(rant)
Intellectuals an sociologists mus come an see
What is happening now orally,
It is really meking history bringing poetry alive
To a dub or funky reggae, to jazz music, rock an jive,
Yu cannot ignore it as de people voice dere feelings
Some are sick of politricks an diplomatic double dealing
So dey picking up de microphone fe dere expression
Dey hav fe get it right or dey get verbal reaction.
CHORUS:
Everybody's rapid rapping
Everybody has a rap
Everybody mus sey someting
It's as simple as dat
Everybody's rapid rapping
It's de order of de day
Some are doing it fe nothing
Some are doing it fe pay
Dere are brothers in America called Public Enemy
Dey rap about de USA an black equality
Dey are militant an I like dem I hope one day we'll meet
Cause I really like dere lyrics an I really luv de beat
KRS 1 an X CLAN are rappers of a kind
Big an broad an massive an out fe blow yu mind
Yuppies do not like dem cause dey say dere superficial
Ghetto people luv dem dat is why dem blow a whistle,
When dey blow a whistle it's because dey dig de style
A rapper mus be open minded an quite versatile
Yu mus never drop a word an all de time yu mus get betta
Be responsible to your community or dey will get ya
I don't agree wid all a dem cause some are very vain
Just give dem some time fe speak in time dey will explain
Cause plenty sisters do it an dis meks me proud
I want to kiss each one a dem but dat is not allowed.


De message dat I hav fe yu is if yu happy rap
An if yu want fe find yu way den use a rapping map
Yu can do it if yu angry yu can do it if yu mad
Jus remember what yu saying an remember good is bad
Yu can't do it if yu drunk or if yu high on someting funky
An if yu getting paid don't feget yu money
An if yu in de charts yu will need a manager
An if yu are a Rasta yu can tour Africa.
No I hav not finished yet no I hav not done
Don't feget de poets because as one we cum
Dere is Linton Kwesi Johnson an de brother Martin Glynn
An de Lioness dat chanting freedom fighters out fe win,
Mikey Smith was stoned to death but his words live on de same
Jean Binta Breeze speaks wid ease so don't feget de name
From Liverpool we get de brother Levi Tafari
I could keep on going till de sun drops out de sky
Mutabaruka, Oku Onuora, John Agard an Grace Nichols
All people who are capable an dey hav principles
Maka-B, Merle Collins, Sister Netifa, Lemn Sissay
I thank all of dem because dey pave de way, yu see
Long time agu before de book existed
Poetry was oral an not playing mystic
Poetry was something dat people understood
Poetry was living in every neighbourhood
Story telling was compelling listening, an entertaining
Done without de ego trip an nu special training
Found in many forms it was de oral tradition
When governments said quiet, poets said no submission.
Now some write it, some chat it
Some money people back it,
Now some rant it, some chant it
Like me, some do it reggaematic,
Some rap it up an rap it out
Jazz people do Jazzoetry
Nu matter how yu check it all of it is poetry
I hav nu hang ups bout de Black chat form
Dis is so important it mus break de norm,
I hav nu hang ups bout its style or rhyme
If a feeling has nu word I mek one a mine,


I tink it is important fe tell dis to people
Poetry was stolen from us an dat was evil,
Put upon de bookshelf by de type dat likes to analyse
Discussed in classy journals by de type wid reading eyes.
Look dere's nothing wrong wid reading
We can read to liberation
But readers mus not put down dis long oral tradition,
Nu dere's nothing wrong wid reading
Just tink people die fe read,
But dere's plenty wrong wid hiding someting
Dat people may need
Some hav taken up de gun
An some take up de pen
Oppressors are aware of dis
An dey fear both of dem,
Lawmakers an media try holding rappers back
An it's no coincidence dat most rappers are Black.
Jus one more ting before I go dat's yu can do it too
Yu don't need fe read an write, be honest, loud an true
Yu don't even need equipment every street
Call it what yu like
Friday de 29th June,
1979 Temperature quite warm,
Need fe rock a while,
Tings kinda calm,
So to meself I sey, where shall I have a ball?
Den de Time Out tell me de scene is Acklam Hall
Live groups, beggar, samaritans, resistance,
Plus special guest.
Off to Acklam Hall
A couple frens wid me,
We never ever pay,
Dem always du me free,
Very good of dem,
Very good in dere.
India rocking,
England rocking
Africa a rock
To de Roots Reggae Track.

We ride pon de beat,
Yes, cool runnings
Kinda beautiful fe see
How everyone rock free.
De Samaritans a getting ready
Hearts set fe luv a Reggae.
Tuning up.
Some a dem a bop to sound system,
Some a romance were lights are dim.
I tek a walk,
I circulate.
I was standing by dis door
Talking to dis girl,


I tell her dat I write
She said I must recite
An den I see a fight.
Dere was so many,
Appearance of Skinheads,
Dem a shout, ‘National Front, National Front,’
Dem a shout, ‘Kill one, Kill one, Kill a Black man,’
Dem a shout, ‘Kill a Black man lover.’
In dem hands dem hav sticks
Dem hav bottles, dem hav bricks,
Dem a hit wid de sticks
An de bottles an de bricks.
A nightmare.
A nightmare, full a fear
I check it as a nightmare,
People falling down everywhere,
An one little exit door,
So much people heading fe dis exit door,
Only one little exit door.
Hysterical,
Terrible,
Hitlers ting in progress.
Women cried in Acklam Hall,
Racist beat all.
I step ina room,
I sight six men
Standing over one man,
One man lying pon de ground,
Thick blood,
Wood splinters,
Glass splinters an tears
An him never want nu charity,
No ambulance,
St Johns man talks in vain,
Blood hides de cut from de eye,
Glass splinters pushing pain.
Not one police number came.


Outside is a shout
De Punks are about.
A shout,
Nazis out, Nazis out.
O Punk, O Punk, de fight nu long,
Yu battle well.
I sight a punk holding a baby,
Lost baby,
De Black child crying,
But we fight back
De best form a attack.
An to meself I sey ‘De Nazis gone commercial.’
An to meself I sey ‘Dis should be controversial.’
Everybody start scatter
Me an me people jus
Exit.
De place was as mad as de world,
Not good,
We hav fe leave dat scene.
Not one police number came.
O Punk, O Punk, de fight nu long,
Yu battle well.
A tribute to the Punks and Anti-Nazi campaigners who battled hard on 29th June 1979 when a group of National Front members invaded a rave at Acklam Hall, Ladbroke Grove, West London.

Now me hear dem a talk bout World Peace,
But dere's Wars at home
An dem Wars will not cease,
Not till all de Queen horses

Words dat fe ever an fe ever yu doubting,
If yu in doubt yu don't hav a shout
When yu talk against dem
Dem sey get out,
Some call it Democracy
I call it Hypocrisy
Dat mek me start feel Revolutionary,
When rich fashion cramps poor style
I stop an after a while I ask,
Is it me class or is it me colour
Or is it a ting I don't yet discover,
Us an Dem it is Us an Dem
When will dis ting ever end,
Us an Dem it is Us an Dem
Yu mus know yu enemy from yu fren,
I repeat again, now it's Us an Dem,
When will dis ting reach a conclusion,
Don't pretend are yu Us or Dem,
Pick yu place from now
Before de confusion.
Cut de crap
Yu offer me a pension
But I know yu intention
Yu high powered connections,
Cut de crap an set I free.
I hav not drunk yu wine
Dat blood yu shed is mine
Yu paper I won't sign,
Cut de crap an set I free.
Yu not doing me nu favour
I was born a rebel raver
Yu is a two faced neighbour,
An yu tink dat yu hav me.
Black starliner like I ride de storm
I looked an den I saw de norm
Said up yours, no I won't conform
An just live selfishly.
Now yu offer me a share
Yu acting like yu care
But how did I get here
Cum we check de history,
Yu want me fe look like yu
It's a phase yu going thru
What yu offer me won't do
So cut de crap an set I free.
Me green poem
Everybody talking bout protecting de planet
as if we jus cum on it
It hard fe understan it.
Everybody talking bout de green revolution
Protecting de children an fighting pollution
But check — capitalism an greed as caused us to need
Clean air to breathe, Yes
When yu get hot under de collar
Yu suddenly discover dat yu going Green all over.
Fe years
Yu hav been fighting wars an destroying de scene
An now dat yu dying
Yu start turn Green
A few years ago if yu wanted peace yu would hav fe mek a
demonstration.
Yu were called a traitor, a Russian infiltrator,
De scourge of de nation
A few years ago if yu said yu were Green
Yu were really seen as Red.
Yes a few years ago yu were seen as a weirdo
If yu were to eat brown bread.
Now yu don't hav to be clever fe know bout salmonella
An dere are many reasons fe diet like a vegan.
Now it is official, don't eat too artificial
When yu told yu hav no future, try some acupuncture.
Fe live long, get wise an try some exercise.
Feget de Harp, stay sharp
An tek care of yu heart
To go jogging is belonging
Walk instead of driving
Now dat yu are dying, start tinking of surviving.
Yu start tinking of surviving now dat yu are dying
Remember old time saying: Beware of what yu spraying
Now is de time fe panic
So let's go eat organic
Yu fridge will burn creation
Dis is so-called progression


Fe years
Yu hav been fighting wars an destroying de scene
An now dat yu dying
Yu start turn Green
Many singer-songwriters hav it as a topic
De rainforests, dose hungry people
‘Daddy we must stop it.’
De ozone layer's fading
I mus make an LP
I'll get de credit an I'll give de cash to charity
I mus be really honest,
An I speak personally,
I don't hav dat much money fe give to charity,
My people were rich but robbed
An we were healthy
So I don't know bout yu, but me, I plead Not Guilty.
So now yu hav a house
World music gets yu high
An now yu exercising hard cause yu don't want to die
An yu got loadsamoney but yu don't need nu cash
Cause yu got loadsa credit cards an yu so proud a dat
De greenhouse effect meks de world hotta
If yu hav loadsamoney really it nu matta.
Nobody knows what's happening to de weather
An all of a sudden we're told to pull together
Pull together?
Pull together
An recycle ya paper.
De government said if yu don't yu will regret it later.
Dem used to sey dat Green was soft
Don't worry bout de atmosphere
An now a scientist has said,
‘Oh damn, we're going to disappear.’
Fe years
Yu hav been fighting wars an destroying de scene
An now dat yu dying
Yu start turn Green
Now when it come to wars, governments are funny
Lives are secondary, first is bloody money
Troops out if it costs too much, troops in if it pays


An in de English dictionary what is war anyway?
Angola..................... dat's war
Afghanistan................. dat's war
Tibet...................... dat's war
Far-off people hav dem,
Ethiopia................... dat's war
El Salvador................. dat's war
Bolivia.................... dat's war
Feel sorry fe de children,
Lebanon..................... dat's war
Gaza....................... dat's war
Mozambique.................. dat's war
An someone's got to stop dem,
Korea...................... dat's war
Haiti...................... dat's war
Northern Ireland...................... dat's something else
Now dat is just a problem.
Still we don't hav nu constitution
An so-called progress breeds pollution
Yu can buy a share in de illusion
Or yu can gu to school an study de Green solution,
Fe years Green tings hav been pushed aside
Now we're going fast on a downward slide
Who's going Green on de sly?
Is dat kinda business upset I
Fe years
Yu hav been fighting wars an destroying de scene
An now dat yu dying
Yu start turn Green
Everybody talking bout protecting de planet
as if we just cum on it
It hard fe understan it.
Everybody talking bout de Green revolution
Protecting de children an fighting pollution.
But check
Humans hav been taking an not giving
An now de boat is sinking yu
Comrades an Frens
Walls cum down an prices rise
Dey dreamt it happens overnight
Awaiting dreams wid hungry eyes
De Eagle an de Bear in flight.
All de Gods are free fe speak
(Earth people still hav nu voice)
Eagles now fly in fe teach
(Brainwash maybe more precise).
Round de table talks on talks
Or talks fe money mekin men
High on profits an odder shorts
De Nineties way of ruling dem.
Welcum to de White Weddin
In death dey cum together
Northerners should all cum in
(It will not last fe ever ers)
Way down South de forest dies
People die wid de forest,
Costly was de bag a lies
Truths so hard fe digest.
Peaceful people fought fe peace
De people feared de dreaded hour,
Now dey can buy de Mystic East
So now dem fight fe power.
A modern slave song
When yu cosy in yu house
Remember I exist,
When yu drink expensive drink
Remember I exist,
When yu lying on me beach
Remember I exist,
When yu trying to sell me beans to me
Remember I exist.
When yu loving each other to death
Remember I exist,
When yu selling me me music
Remember I exist,
When yu sell dat cotton shirt
Remember I exist,
When yu interviewing me
Remember I exist.
I was de first inventor — remember
I am black an dread an luv — remember
I am poor but rich, don't mess — remember
I made history — remember.
Yu tried to shut me mouth — remember
Yu studied me an filmed me — remember
Yu spending me money — remember
Yu trying to feget me but remember,
Remember I am trained to not give in,
So don't feget.
Remember I hav studied studying
So don't feget.
Remember where I come from, cause I do.
I won't feget.
Remember yu got me, cause I'll get yu.
I'll mek yu sweat.
U-Turn
Handsworth, Brixton, St Pauls, Broadwater Farm,
Toxteth, Highfields, Bradford, Ladbroke Grove,
Somebody better mek a U-turn
Before de fire start burn.
De culprit is hidden
In a very nice house, in a very nice town
Wid comfortable surroundings,
De culprit has taken
De power of de beast, disturbing de peace
An give de power to police.
Somebody better check it out,
Somebody better get it right,
Somebody better check de atmosphere
Cause fire ago burn tonight,
Somebody better check de scene
Fe see exactly what I mean
De people of power can't hide cum de hour
An voters hans aren't clean.
Somebody better mek a U-turn before de fire start burn.
Moss Side, Wolverhampton, Belfast, Chapeltown,
Hackney, Peckham, Brent, Stoke Newington,
Someone's mispending de cash
Children will burn de place to ash
History's being made me people hav paid
An children grow up in a flash,
An innocent woman is dead, shot sleeping in her bed
Words hav been spoken, de chains hav been broken
An now we're feeling dread, AN RED.
Somebody better mek a U-turn before de fire start burn.
How's dat
No Sir
I don't play Cricket,
One time I try
Fearing a duck
I watch de ball fly towards me,
I recall every spin
An unforgettable air speed,
It bounced before me
Jus missing a two day old ant,
Up it cum
A red flash
Lick me finger so hard
I thought me finger would die.
Teacher tell me
I am good at cricket,
I tell teacher
I am not,
Teacher tell me
We luv cricket,
I tell teacher
Not me,
I want Trigonometry
Fe help me people,
Teacher tell me
I am a born Cricketer,
But I never......(well only once),
I don't play cricket.
She's crying for many
She is flesh of me flesh
I am bone of her bone
So please stop kicking her
Beg yu leave her alone,
She is not fighting back
Find de love dat yu lack
Dat's me sista yu beating upstairs.
I am feeling dem punches
I am feeling dem kicks
I see where yu mind is
I check yu as sick,
So yu are ‘De Man’,
Easy man, if yu can,
Dat's me sista yu beating upstairs.
She's screaming,
An it seems dat yu will not stop,
‘Dis is domestic’,(de words of a cop)
An yu keep repeating,
‘Tell me where you've been’,
She's trying fe tell yu,
Yu not listening,
Downstairs me flat is shaking,
De lights are crazy swaying,
An I can hear loudly each word yu are saying,
I feel dat her body is touching me ceiling,
An I see de man from inside yu revealing.
She's crying fe many,
Dere's many de same,
An don't try fe tell me de Bible's to blame,
De colours yu fly outside, carry dem home,

Yu should live alone,
Dat problem needs checking,

Remember yu mudda

Yu energy's wasted
Yu bitterness tasted,
An all dat yu stand fa as been demonstrated.
So now yu feel sexy,
Does dat turn yu on?
After yu cum tell me where ave yu gone?
Yu bed's only playing de riddim of one,
Music direct from de great Babylon,
Who carved de image an space you mus fill?
Is she de enemy dat yu mus kill?
Do yu tell yu friends how yu get yu cheap thrills?
Does yu mudda know dat yu acting so ill?
She is flesh of me flesh
I am bone of her bone,
I cannot help hearing,
I am downstairs alone,
Yu reap what yu sow,
How comes yu don't know
Dats OUR sister yu beating upstairs.
Question
Me watching me.
Hungry me.
Me belly swell
Me separate dirt from grain
Me looking amazed at a plane
Me in Africa a Squatter
Me at home a Refugee.
Me watching me.
Sitting comfortably
Ina hi-tech city
In touch wid de Modern World
In touch wid old frens
Me ask me,
Why is dere Famine ina land so Rich?
De BMW in Addis Ababa shock some
De Champagne ina Nigeria drunk some
De Canned Food of South Africa hurt some
From de Diamond to de Rand to de Dollar
De Africa unity worry some
Me need fe luv me neighbour badly
So Aid can't control me,
Like false borders hold me
Divide an rule me.
It could be me
It is me
Me watching me
Pon TV.
Me know bout Coffee
Me know bout Sugar
Me know bout Silver an Gold
Me stilla ask me
Why is dere Famine ina land so Rich?
The SUN
I believe the Blacks are bad
The Left is loony
God is Mad
This government's the best we've had
So I read The SUN.
I believe Britain is great
And other countries imitate
I am friendly with The State,
Daily, I read The SUN.
I am not too keen on foreign ones
But I don't mind some foreign bombs
Jungle bunnies play tom-toms,
But, I read The SUN.
Man, I don't like Russian spies
But we don't have none
I love lies,
I really do love Princess Di
I bet she reads The SUN.
Black people rob
Women should cook
And every poet is a crook,
I am told — so I don't need to look,
It's easy in The SUN.
Every hippie carries nits
And every Englishman love tits
I love Page Three and other bits,
I stare into The SUN.
I like playing bingo games
And witch-hunting to shame a name
But aren't newspapers all the same?
So why not read The SUN.


Don't give me truth, just give me gossip
And skeletons from people's closets,
I wanna be normal
And millions buy it,
I am blinded by The SUN.
Ringside
This is Art,
Let gum shields fly
Let eyes bleed
Let blood run,
Hit head
Rattle brains
With a right and a left
And a left and a right.
Knockouts are best
But not too soon,
This match is expensive
We want value for money,
We come to watch work
We are dressed in our best boxing suits
This is Legal
And we seek entertainment.
There is still great White hope
Until then Black on Black is fine,
We took these lads from the streets
If it wasn't for us he would starve.
We feed him
We train him
We cheer him on
We pat his back,
There is no one like him
Or him
Or him
If it wasn't for us he would rob you,
Ask him.
A right and a left
A left and a right,
We get so carried away
So much tension it hurts.
We can't fight to save our wallets
We leave it to the Boys,
He would fight anyway,


When he loses his temper
We head for the Board Room,
If he hits us
He goes to Jail.
He's a smart lad, he's bright,
And he waves our flag,
When he's brain dead
We shall set him up in advertising,
He can open shops
Do the Children's TV bit
He can see our doctors
Buy us drinks.
Widda a leff an a right
An a right an a leff
Jab him
Box him down,
Uppercut, uppercut
Knock him out fe ten seconds, no less
Wid style fe de viewers at home.
Yu Black
Yu British
Yu Black
Yu American
Yu Black
Yu Canadian
Yu White

Poor,
Box yu Brother.
