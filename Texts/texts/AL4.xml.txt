New test is developed to find cancer of cervix
By David Fletcher Health Services Correspondent
A NEW way to detect women at high risk of developing cervical cancer is announced today by a team of researchers from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
Existing smear tests find slight abnormalities in 250,000 women every year but cannot distinguish between those who will go on to develop serious disease and those who will not.
Dr Jack Cuzick, an ICRF scientist, said that 75,000 of the women were likely to have important underlying disease but, without referring all 250,000 to hospital, there was no way of knowing which women were in that group.
Dr Malcolm Anderson, one of the researchers from University Hospital, Nottingham, said the screening service was inundated with large numbers of mildly abnormal smear results.
Women received different follow-up treatment in different parts of the country, including smear tests at shorter intervals, which was risky, or colposcopy — an examination of the cervix with a microscope — which was expensive.
But the researchers, writing in the medical magazine Lancet, describe a new way of detecting levels of the human papilloma virus HPV 16 in smear cells.
This virus is harmless at low levels, but high levels indicate disease in 90 per cent of cases.
Dr Cuzick said it was very likely that women with only minor abnormalities but high levels of HPV 16 might well have high grade disease and need a colposcopy check.
The researchers, at University College, London, and Nottingham, say the test would not replace the smear but would be an effective and cheaper alternative than referring all women with slightly abnormal results for colposcopy.
