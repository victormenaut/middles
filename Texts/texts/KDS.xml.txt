So they're making a new dictionary?
It's not writing  sound  sound.
Instead of people having to read up the words in a dictionary it's gonna be a sound dictionary.
Speak.
be able to speak to the, to the  machine
Mhm.
and it will speak back what, what the meaning of that word is like with an ordinary dictionary.
That's what they are  researching to do.
all different meanings of the wor but can you not just look at the dictionary and read the dictionary ?
Pardon?
Can you not just read the dictionary ?
You know just look up in the dictionary 
Yeah but er  it was set up because of for foreigners  words  to pronounce the words properly, that's why they wanted 
different people,of people to do sections   pensioners  er shopkeeper and a   
Oh yes cos there must have been, that was John doing that     this is  oh this is great fun he says, and he er  Johnny was saying that erm  if he whispered  he would only speak up louder.
What he knows about these things would be great.
And he was saying that it's erm  a speaking dic dictionary, that's what they're going to  researching for
Mhm.
a spoken dictionary.
And he said what they're tr er what they want to do is erm  pick out a word  pick out a word and then  in a conversation they would fi find out how many  meanings to that one word.
Oh right.
You know er on er or how many spellings  Eng in the English language, through  though, though  throughout, thorough, all spelt the, near enough the same
but all d all different meanings  and they could pick out  and I said well  erm it would  er  be handy for foreign people to have a speaking dictionary because they would be able to pick up the pronunciation of that word wouldn't they?
Mhm.
Instead of reading it down, I mean say a Frenchman reading it down, say through  erm
He wouldn't understand that would he?
he wouldn't understand that.
No.
And th they could get the pronunciation as well, be able to, to speak it properly besides spelling it.
And they  I think you would learn languages quickly by that way.
Oh yeah  
So I think  that's, I think that's what's gonna happen.
So erm
Well does  will you still hear yourself Katie?
Where that is.
I suppose so.
I had mine away up here.
Did you?
Yeah your voice 
 
your voice over you know 
You know what, my voice was 
Ah
I'd of  I just
Could you?
Yes  
Imagine putting three tapes on   
Oh yeah!
 

Well I have not stopped 
 
come home.
Not  I went to bed last night at twelve o'clock  John and Ryan was in bed about twelve I think, the two of them just fell straight to sleep.
Did you mind him going over there, staying over there ?
No I did not, I asked him if he wanted to stay.
Did you?
Mhm.
He walked out 
I 
walked out of here in a huff 
Did he?
Yeah   See er John's a bit too, well he's a bit oldish or old in his ways to  to have the responsibility of youngsters.
Mm.
He, he can't let them go.
He's worried about them the whole time.
I think that Ryan was saying something that John fell out with him because of his motorbike.
Yeah.
He says  John's  won't speak to me now because of the motorbike  and er  I says oh Ryan you must be imagining things, he says no he says he just won't talk to me  because I've got the motorbike.
Well I said maybe 
 
maybe he's worried about you falling off it or   
Well he is worried about them having an accident with it but, but he's not er  worried about him having the motorbike, no he  cos he would have done the same as a er child anyway  well things like that, but erm what he's worried about is that  er with Ryan i and the other boy,n not Ryan so much, the other boy does it all the time, they're churning all the grass up all over there in great big 
Well that's because Ryan 
Yeah.
Well he goes like lightning over there 
Yeah well the police are down here  watching and what J er  what erm John, John's worried about is that erm  the police have been along here and they've had, had complaints and John was out at the gate and he was talking to them and they, they'll fine them.
And John says like  Joan can't afford to p to pay fines.
So
I don't think John's ever on Ryan's mind you.
Oh he, he has 
Has he?
he has been on it yeah 
Has he been on it?
And then of course going up and down here see there's the notice up there no motorbikes.
Aye there's five, I think there's five courses now closed down, there's only two left.
They're only allowed in two  Ryan said.
So where them two are I don't know.
What the courses?
Mhm.
Yeah.
But this, this path  it's against the law to ride on.
Yeah.
See they've got, on the, on the lamp post there they've got the  signs up.
Mhm.
And like John said if they, the way they come along here so fast  if any child came out of their back gate they'd have no chance.
Mm.
No chance of stopping, they would kill theirselves.
Ryan used to wheel it down  before I went to hospital he used to wheel it down  but he, now I see he rides it down.
Yeah that's because he's with the other boy.
See when they're with others.
There's there's eleven, eleven 
Is there?
or twelve of them.
Yeah.
Yeah if they only wh wheeled it down and then they're allowed on the paths 
I'll have a word with him.
round.
And er  but not where there's houses, it's like a car
That's right.
you've got your thirty mile limit
That's right.
wha er like 
It's true you know if a di if a child did come out the gate, with that wee fella yesterday I saw him  he was with Ryan  and he went up that  path like lightning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I heard Ryan coming on  a good wee bit behind him, but this,up that path like, I says to  if that wee fella fell off that bike he's killed.
Yes.
Yes  
But his coat his coat was flapping like that.
yeah.
And, or else he'd be severely injured that he's got the, the family rest of their life having to look after him and  and could kill somebody.
Couldn't couldn't  
See cos there's no insurance or licence 
Well Ryan Ryan, he's insured.
Is he?
Mhm.
We've had, we've them insured from when they were born.
Aha.
But fr 
 
but insured for riding a bike?
No.
No, see they're, they're supposed to have an insurance  mechanical and a licence.
So they could be stopped.
I think the, the police are just  watching
Mm.
but if they really catch them  cos they're down here a lot now because of er what's going on underneath those arches
Ooh them arches are terrible Kate.
Ooh the other night you never heard 
drugs oh dear dear.
But a lot of them  young kids of twelve year old, twelve to thirteen 
 
Yeah, yeah course i it's when they're 
 
in with a crowd they, they, they get a bit you know,dar daredevils, they ooh, they want to do it.
But it's only when they're in a crowd but course, among that crowd are some that are bad and some that are good get carried along with them, that's 
Mm that's the thing.
that, that's the trouble.
And that's true you know  Lindsey's far too old for her age or you'd think she was o she er oh she was like Andrea
Yeah.
Yes, yeah, yeah 
you know the way Andrea was at that age?
You would have swore she was  seventeen
Yes, mhm.
well Lindsey, mind she  smoking when she was twelve and drinking  and she didn't like it she says because it made her head go all funny and she didn't know what was going on, what was happening.
Oh dear  
But she says mummy I didn't like that feeling.
And 
Ah 
she says I didn't take any more, and I haven't taken any more.
And I cried, I must have cried Kate for two hours.
Yeah I know it's awful worry, if they only understood how, how the parents worry about it.
Well then I must have cried for two hours and  
Yeah.
After all the, the  and feeling great  just knocked the  
Course it do course it do.
That's wh that's what er any er John gets t touchy because he can't really, big man he is, he, he can't really take responsibility
Mhm.
and he thinks that while the children are here, he's responsible for every move.
It's got so that he was the same with Joan,
 
you have to let 
you have to let go.
have to let go.
Erm 
Because I found with Lindsey, anyway, with Ryan I had no trouble or nothing  cos the only
Yeah.
bother I've ever had with him, and he goes on to it and away he goes and he'll come back in the house  and he'll go up the stairs  to the computer, and that's his life.
But with Lindsey it was the smoking, the drinking  staying out, out pretending she was babysitting  erm ringing her daddy home and saying daddy can I babysit the night till half eleven  and her daddy's thinking that she was telling the truth
Yeah that  
and then he's saying yes as long as you, you are babysitting
Aha.
and she wasn't babysitting, she was out till half eleven at night
Aha.
and I phoned one night late and, it was late and I phoned for I wanted her to come home, and I was  it was quarter to twelve and  said  she's not home yet.
Well Kate what a night I spent and  I must have phoned
Yeah
every ten minutes.
So she arrived, eventually arrived in at quarter to twelve.
She said she'd been babysitting, but then  and the doors and  and  and I  this filthy, filthy, dirty letter somebody had written to her, some other girl
Aha yeah 
that she'd chummed about with had written to her 
Mhm.
and we were gonna get the police to ge w well i it just said the, the short name and we thought it was a boy that had written  and if it had've been we were gonna get the police because she's under age you see.
She's under age, yeah.
Mhm.
And er  I  so  so I brought her and her three friends that she'd run, chummed about with them  and I give them a good talking to for about an hour.
I  and er  told Lindsey if she'd ever any problems never to write them down to a friend
Yeah
but to come to me
do you, do you want this off?
No  no  but suppose some other mother may be listening to it have go through the same thing.
Mhm.
But she's  getting carried away with this, though her friends are good enough but they're all getting carried away as you would say  with a bad crowd.
Yeah, yes it's  only wants one bad one among the crowd, like a ba a b bad apple, go through the lot.
I'm having the trouble with her at the moment.
But what chance have they got round here?
I mean that's the that's the attitude of 
Well there's nothing for them 
of the majority of them isn't it?
there is nothing for them.
Nothing.
Well thank God Joan's gone through that period.
She was the same.
She used to say, say, phone up and say she was  and I used to say well where  give me the address, just anything happens to us
Mhm.
we can get in touch, well she'd never give the address of where she was babysitting.
And she'd, she'd even get her girlfriend's mother to ring up to say she was staying there the night, the mothers used to s ring up Joan  tell them that it was al alright for er for er Andrea to stay there the night and she was never, she was camping out in the fields with a crowd of them  oh
go through it you know.
Yeah.
You don't realize  you're going through it.
I never realized what I put my mother through when I was going 
And it was er  
through it my, myself.
No.
Oh w well I don't think the temptations were there when we were younger.
No.
Not like the I feel sorry 
Even conversation like me and you talking here, the children would have been put outside
Yeah.
or up on their beds or something.
That's right.
Not allowed to speak
No.
or anything like that.
Didn't do us any harm
Eilleen, did it?
All this strict upbringing.
My father was very strict 
Well  that's what  fourteen, and I've had never no trouble with him.
No.
Never ever had a, except he  he goes mad when he gets older but I don't think it's him
No, no see  eventually 
you know  
er when Pearl, my other daughter came over Christmas, course Andrea was more or less still going through a bit of a rough period with  between her grandfather and her, you know?
Erm  and she's had seven  youngsters and she's brought them up and she a , on her own she's had to bring them up cos he left her for another, another woman  and erm she had the seven  and she's worked and fought hard cos she wouldn't ask for a darn thing  and er  they're, they're great those kids, they are, they're a credit to her, you know, but it's taken it out of her, she's
That's what I said, it takes it out of you.
Ooh!
It's taken it out of her but she's 
 
fought hard for them but she's been very 
 
I've marvelled at her cos as a youngster I never thought she was capable of doing what she's done, and she's brought them up fine and  fair.
She's, she's let go when she knew that she ought to let go.
And she, she had a go at er  Johnny here, she said you 
Well when do you let go Kate?
she said you, you've got to tr you've got to trust them  and, and 
But when you trust them and then they tell you lies what do you do?
Yeah  yeah but 
You know I just can't er 
but she said  but  Pearl said what's in them when they're born  what  take after their mother and their father  that'll come out in the finish.
They go through these periods of revolting against  their sort of erm tight upbringing
Mhm.
and they revolt against it and you've just gotta keep your fingers crossed that nothing happens to them in that period.
But they do come out of it cos Joan's, Joan's had 
Mine's just going through it very young though.
Yeah, well Joan was, Joan was the same  and she's a different girl altogether, she's, she's absolutely great.
Cos it's, it's there, it's her nature like Pearl said, her nature as she is will 
When I look at Lindsey 
come out the same.
when I look at Lindsey and what she's doing at the minute, I look back to my own life  at her age
Mhm.
I was doing exactly the same.
Were you?
Aha.
You know 
Yeah.
when I, I was  staying out late at night, I was going against my mother, every word she said it was  wrong you know I wanted to do my own thing and 
Oh yeah, aha, yeah.
I see an awful, awful lot of Lindsey in me.
Mhm.
What I used to be like  not, not as young as her like
No.
you know
No of course that's all gradually gone on see, I mean when  even when er at fourteen, fifteen we, we had to be, all be in bed asleep before nine o'clock at night.
What are you going in there for?
John 
And he would be the right one to b be on this because I mean he's so intelligent, he would  but  he won't even   I think he must of turned that tape on yesterday.
Aye  
But he speaks the, the wo A Ann was her name, she said that he speaks too softly to  to go on to that.
Well I don't suppose they'll, they'll never understand me I don't suppose.
Oh dear  
They only pick out a word  word here and there see 
Oh  
Yeah.
Aha.
Yeah.
Joan's just rung  see they come over for, all of them come over for dinner every Sunday, and er  Joan's er Andrea's going out with a crowd of them today  she's in with a nice girl  a girl er married and the husband, he's  treats Andrea as if it's a  baby sister, so he's more or less looking after her which is  Joan's very pleased about
Mhm.
and they live near them  and his wife's, he's away from home a lot, so his wife's happy because she's got Joan for company and gradually  she's getting her old self and she won't be coming over today so she's phoned her granddad up to let him know so  he won't be worried.
It gets to them in the finish  and there's about eight of them 
 
all going out for a Chinese because it's this girl's birthday tomorrow, so there's  er  eight of them all going out.
Well Lindsey she's  to go to a disco night in  in a fortnight's time  all her friends she says are going.
So I says only on one condition  if your daddy pi leaves you at the door at  school and picks you up
Oh yeah.
after.
Mhm.
Well you can't get out to get drunk or do anything bad.
Well she'll be in the  school there'll be, there'll be teachers there that'll be watching over them
Yeah.
you know and  she says well  I said that's the only way Lindsey you're going to get it  and I says I mean that's the only way you're going to get it.
So er she says well you can think about it for a fortnight er you see her daddy put out discos altogether because of the lies but she  cos she gets nervous because when she's telling a lie to you  she'll go red  
Red.
Oh you can read their faces can't you?
You don't even have to look at her face, you just have to look at her neck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I blame myself you see for going in the hospital.
Now this is the first weekend Kate we'd really a good weekend you know  I've worked and worked and last weekend I could do nothing.
The weekend before that they only allowed me out one day overnight
So do you feel better in yourself then?
I feel great.
Yeah, oh great.
You're not, have you still got 
 
to do that six months or not?
No.
Oh good.
 

Oh good, yeah.
Well that was hanging over your head.
Oh that was, I, I was waiting on them saying   and you see you're constantly  worry of what's going on at home, and that's not helping really.
Yeah aha.
Whereas when you are at home
I've just said are you still having to do the six months, it'll sound as if you're getting  a prison sentence   
Well it is a prison sentence let me tell you
It is like, yeah, instead of having for, for, for treat treatment 
for you're watched where you're going and you're followed where you're going.
Oh yes I mean their attitude there is not very good is it?
Not, it's n no good f to help.
Well I'm going in this weekend, I've to go in tomorrow  morning, and I'm gonna just say I want to go home.
But then they'll  and say wait till Thursday till the round, the doctor's round.
See even if it's only for the three days
Oh of course the doctor's got to sign you off anyway hasn't he?
I'd rather have the doctor saying that I can't go home  rather than me signing myself out.
Yeah, oh yes
But you see you worry about Lindsey at home.
Yeah.
Well her daddy he's not so bad, he's  I think he has two long days  but as you say well sh sh you can't 
 
be with them every twenty four hours of the day can you?
No, no, no.
Only 
but we had the same thing with, course it's going back  Joan's generation  er  see  younger generation altogether than mine but  our, our lives were  well we'll say well  my father was in the Secret Service, in the government, Scotland Yard   but erm
so we was known, no no, no dear, no it's, I've, tell by the sound of the throat, got a s bit of a sore throat
You're 
Filled up ?
No 
Have I?
Yeah, mm well I 
You've lost an awful lot of weight
Yeah, yeah, look    get the fingers round there .
I couldn't do these up some time ago but erm I have, I've lost weight, but erm 
 
Mm  feel good.
So erm   the only thing this shaking comes on  but er years ago I mean  we daren't go against our parents.
Oh   you wouldn't go, well I wouldn't say that you could  my father would've half killed us
If he knew, yeah, yeah.
but it didn't do us any good.
Well w we didn't have to do, do anything that way because we were allowed  our freedom up to a certain time  and that was it.
Mm.
But there wasn't the temptations now you see 
At six o'clock you were dead.
Then.
Yeah.
Well even m er my kiddies  er  not An er Joan so much but the others  seven o'clock was the latest they ever went to bed.
I remember mummy putting us to bed at six.
Six o'clock on a Saturday night and  
Yeah, mm, yeah.
Well we was the same a and er they didn't mind it.
I was laughing about with er what's, I'm gonna write er a note to my chi er letter to my children for, you know, before  very long  no good thinking about it, well you wouldn't think about it after  when it's too late, but my kids have been a  you know a great comfort  the four from my first  Joan, Joan has too, she's been a dear but we had the same problems when she was getting older.
Times I've, I've sat up at the window trying to wa watch her coming round  two o'clock in the morning  hoping that he's fallen asleep down in the armchair.
And then opening the door quietly for her to come in and
You do, you try to stand up for them, protect them 
Oh!
Yeah yeah.
you know
But i is it right?
But then when he has 
 
wo woken up and heard her come in and that he's had her standing in front of him and the old finger's been going, exactly what he's doing now, he's done it with his
Mm
with Joan.
And the finger's stood there and she's had to stand there  shaking from head to foot 
Well I know the night Lindsey was smoking and she had  or something  but  smelt the smoke on her breath and he got the belt and he gave her a belt  and I lay in bed  Kay and I cried
Yeah it's, yeah 
I couldn't there was nothing I could do.
Yeah.
And if I had a  went in to comfort her  I might as well of undone everything he did  
Yeah that's right she, you, you've gotta er grit
But it didn't do any good, the next morning she was smoking in the bathroom.
Was she?
So it didn't help.
No.
She was grounded.
That hasn't helped.
She has talked, we've talked to her yesterday, was it yesterday?
Or the day before?
Yesterday I think  well m maybe the day before  Friday.
So she started to cry and all then and said  she said she was sorry, and right enough she stuck to the time  that we allow her to, she's come in last night dead on the button.
Did she?
Oh yeah, yeah.
That's give her the start and then you
I says Lindsey if you want us to trust you, you have got to tell the truth
Yeah, oh yes see 
and let us know what you're doing.
Yeah.
You see even when they tell the truth, if they've been telling lies for a long time, even if they, when they tell the truth you don't believe them
Mhm
because of the lies they've told before
that's right.
so that you
Well she was staying overnight at some wee girl's house  and I'd say well that's alright as long as you're  as long as, you know, that  know the wee girl's mother maybe, she's a daughter a wee bit older than Lindsey herself who had the , but no this mother  see  she was divorced and going with these men and let her daughter stay out to half eleven, and Lindsey  was,n wasn't in her house till half eleven.
So I says now that's stopped
Yeah.
so that definitely has stopped, you'll not be staying with anybody  overnight.
No.
You see
But it's hard Kay isn't it?
it was, that's the same with er
But  
with, with my granddaughter, she, she did the same s she used to go and babysit at this girl's house and she fe felt, she was only fourteen, and she felt sorry for her  and she'd go and babysit every night she'd go and babysit  and er  but she used to b sit up in the bedroom, she never ever went down the sitting room thinking that the  child's mother was either down in the sitting room or just going out for a short while and coming back and then eventually they put erm a bed up in the child's bedroom for  Denise to stay there over nights and Pearl didn't worry at all, well she knew, knew where, at least she knew where and er  this girl was bringing men back down in the sitting room every night, three or four, sometimes ten men in a night  during the night!
And Denise is there  fourteen and a very attractive girl and that .
The, the  that she was under, and Pearl did, Pearl was trusting her and, and knew, and so the  Denise was saying the right thing, she was staying in the bedroom, never knew what was going on down there.
It's these people that  lead to 
I know.
They've got no thought only for their selfish own ways you see.
That's right.
Well I says to Lindsey, said if you ever want me out of that hospital Lindsey you'd better start and be good.
But I know she's gonna  sh she's in tonight and she's gonna have to go out there.
I know she is, it's a stage she's going through.
You know?
Mhm.
But hopefully  
Yeah 
last too long.
Oh yeah.
I do 
Andrea was up to see me one day.
What up at the hospital?
Mhm.
Oh did she, she, did she go?
She said she w you know, would like to go 
She come up 
up to see Eilleen and I said I'm sure it would be alright.
Mhm.
We were talking of the boys you know one time she used to go with Richard and
Yeah.
she says Eilleen do you remember the time she said I went with Richard?
I says c how could I ever forget it, I said it must have been near halloween, one halloween, for I remember her coming to the party  and that's how her and Richard met.
Aha.
she was saying now is he still going with the girl that he was, that he's going wi he was going with and I says he's still .
That's where he's away this weekend to her place, and then he's going next weekend because there's some wedding do or something  er so he's to go  next weekend, he goes there, stays with her parents and then she'll come down the weekend after that  and stay at our house.
She'll, she'll 
That's er er c 
sleep in Lindsey's room you see and then 
Does she?
Lindsey sleeps  in Richard's bed and Richard he sleeps on the settee.
Yeah.
So er
Well then er er 
he's settled down.
it's going ni it's going nice, oh good.
Gr Joan 
That's going good now.
er Andrea has even, I suppose it was one day last week she was happened to speak about  ooh she said  I was only thinking d the other day she said I was long the longest with Richie R Richie
She calls him  
R R Ricky er Richie er   longer than she'd been with any  you know, boy that she got on with  
Well Richard's so much,i it's what  an awful lot of childishness in him 
Yeah 
He still plays with wee men, you know he, he will have this strip of board 
Yeah.
and he would have all these wee men  and like  different huts, and this is all set out  and he's a brilliant  drawer, I've never seen him draw 
Is he?
oh really brilliant drawer
Really.
I was cleaning out the room there the other day and he must be training, he must be weightlifting or something up in the bedroom but he's a health  health book, a big thick health book  and there's bodies, you know, the human body
Aha.
and their muscles would be  
Yeah 
where the muscles are
Aha.
and honest to goodness Kay they're brilliant, where he has, where he has just 
Aha 
copied them out of the book.
Well what's he going in for?
Does he want to go in for ta 
He's he's might be getting a job, I don't know what he want he doesn't really know what he wants to do yet
Oh.
but he might be getting a job felting roofs, putting roofs and  and 
Oh well that th that's a pity if he's got a a a thing for drawing, he wants to go in for 
 
draughtsmanship or something like that, people 
I says Richard would you not even go on to the tech and, or somewhere that you could  get better on your drawing and he, he 
Develop on that.
does really brilliant figures of people you know.
Yeah.
Er er he tried one time, he'd got his daddy's photograph  and he was actually trying to draw his father  from the photograph
Mhm.
Mhm.
and there was a great resemblance.
But these men, you know these, these  men with the armour and all on them?
Oh yes, soldiers 
Oh he's brilliant, he has them stuck on the side of his wardrobe door on big pages this size, you know, maybe this height, and it's detailed right through the whole thing.
Me and Andy 
You, you want 
was looking at them the other day and they're really brilliant.
You want to let John see them cos he's a marvellous artist.
Mhm.
You want to see the oil paintings he's done.
I must bring them, I must bring a couple  
Yeah bring them over and let John 
 
see them
Mhm.
