SWIMMING INTO NEW YEAR
for Goolden
The water is like night out there.
Don't dive.
It is the sun of last year darkening.
But you remember the sky of your smile;
you remember the window of the sea.
Now its blue is blurred with winter; salt tears,
as grey as clouds, mourn and fall on iron waves.
Don't dive, the horizon is closed for repairs:
there is black-out on both sides of the swell.
Don't dive, you will only fall into midnight.
But you remember swooping into spring;
you remember liquid as warm as light.
You remember last year like love.
Don't dive.
other voices
what are these other voices
subtracted with light into
the white eye of the moon?
their paper-thinness, their invisibility
reverberates in fragile spaces
clinging to the gust of windswept words
what is the language they whisper,
substituting texts of utterance,
gratuitous names, with speech of silences?
how do words travel to the ends
of the earth without moving?
they gather at waiting tables like ghosts;
they softly converse out of ear-shot 
if I interrupt them, what will I say, what
if their answers are so private they do
not repeat them, or I cannot hear?
in the diminuendo
I could only confess that loss in sounds
which would never be traced
and is abandoned, and disappears
its echo still echoes, its ripples widen
THE MEETING
How gracefully this tree bends in my heart;
its branches flower there; its leaves grow;
its sun drifts in such graceful curves.
The fields stretch away; acres where hands
have not touched, words not made their mistakes.
Now, the meeting, the meeting out of moonlight,
the time of mistakes, the time of our words.
The shade of the tree in my heart descends:
for the love that is given
is the love that is taken away.
REVOLUTIONARY
for Lucia
He worked night
after night
while I slept.
He made speech
after speech
while I was
silent.
He
made public
appearance
after public
appearance
while I
was private.
While he was
celibate
I made love.
His hope was
for freedom
while I had
it.
He made
a vision
for life while
I made up
my dreams.
Then
the tanks came
and aimed their
guns at his
head while I
was a pacifist.
He still lives.
He still looks
like anyone.
His eyes are
still lowered
searching for
peace in the
gutters while
I still yearn
for high life.
While he has
acquired a
stutter from
bullets still
ricocheting
in his head
I fluently
still look on.
LIFE AFTER ROMANCE
You still get married like martyrs,
with love locked in your eyes seeing
the first romance there of a girl.
So when you become a woman,
desire can never be satisfied,
understanding never reached
and escape never ever made.
The best way to spend time then
is in disappointment.
You can always decide to change
your minds, of course; cheer up, get
on with things: the outcome, though, is still
as ordinary as every day.
Truth to tell, very few of you feel
like you have lived on the scale
of your first-found romance with yourself;
when your real-life fairy tale
turned on the whim of a page.
My day-dream is the same; we should meet:
there are hospitals now for such stories,
where comparisons can be made.
SIMPLE
I have been travelling backwards.
What I've seen, I have seen sideways.
When I have been moved, I have stopped.
I have grown implausibly.
Not been a comfortable shape.
My maturation is age.
There's been no form to develop.
There's been no fugal counterpoint.
I have therefore suffered great loss.
I have held myself in abeyance.
I have been in love with love.
Excessively lucid of death.
I've been wonderfully self-aware.
To the point of melodrama.
I have not known what to achieve.
I have not known how to express it.
I have shouted clear-sightedly.
My silences have been beautiful.
There have been discoveries.
Affection has terrified me.
Rejection has disgusted me.
Self-deception has been sensual.
I have been too educated.
I have been too self-indulgent.
I've had no life-changing illness.
I have avoided injury.
There have still been crucial moments.
I've been pitilessly tender.
I have been feebly alarmist.
I've alternated rapidly.
I've kept to my version of life.
It's been no small thing to be simple.
BEING POSITIVE
in lasting memory of A J Ayer
No matter how much
we are in love, when
you and me look out
of the same window,
we do not see
the same things: there is
a world of difference.
In adoration
what we see is as
alone as you, as me.
STREET TALK
for David & Bruce
Like public refuse in repose,
darkness tips itself
in sweltering four-leaf clovers
like one big love affair piled
from human cries in streets
echoing with old bones,
smelling of broken hearts.
The wall of night is the last likeness,
stretched in black nirvanas
of luxury and calm,
vertigo poised at its edge.
What remains whispers the whisper
of the startled stare before death.
It is the silence which finally sounds;
nothingness which finally lives:
earth spreads itself on itself.
We are carried on feathers.
We fall with shade under a tree.
We feared the end of poetry.
NOLDE
for Susan
You can see air forever
on breathtakes of light
about to break 
and burst from the depths
of unswimmable shade
in gashes of sunset
tearing open the clouds
like heart-break
glowing in a single flower
or drained on the reeds blowing
nervous-systems of sight
into ice-cold pools
of blood freezing with life
caught in the colour
of their own desire
like tear-laden winds
stilling themselves to hold
red preciously in the sky
COUNTRY VISIT
The wind blows like hair
or fingers parted
irresistibly
by water, softly
nodding the heads of flowers,
its movement tactile as stone.
I breathe that air, your breath,
and try to interfere
with life without knowing
what happens next blowing
silently out of the sea,
trying to take in what had gone
before the mist settles
on fields of words like
out-of-focus memory 
the heart-beat of the countryside
of you getting fainter
in the oldness of yesterday
the train taking the last corner
when lushly waving grass
turns into the tops of trees
like splinters in an eye
and dark at the end of the
tunnel becomes other light.
BUDAPEST
Here, life has faded
its colours to pastel:
the buildings absorbed
sunshine a long time
ago and now they
have their own shade.
Even the dogs know
better than to start out
to accomplish a walk:
the streets already
know their way, the paths
how to meander,
the river how to run on.
One minute people
are there, the next they
are gone â€” like centuries.
What is expected
is absolutely
nothing so that can
be looked upon too:
making love, eating
bread are like invasions
of privacy in
the eyes of little girls.
Here still has to get
up in the morning:
today's music
at dawn in the trees
has happened before.
THE PHOTOGRAPH
Suffusions of an Italian film,
your aloneness foreground, theirs behind.
Each frozen image has been warmed into
soft focus, like a special effect.
The manic-depressive who took the shot
has abandoned it, has disappeared in
perpetual insecurity:
culpably having pictured kinds of truth.
What is left is loneliness, human state,
normality suffering in colours
about to become dusk, followed by dark,
a black photograph which will not turn out.
What is left of what is shown is just before,
he searching into the camera for you,
the rest of the crowd taking up stances
of blindness and so unable to look.
No one remembers the scene or the set;
they move on, out of camera, your ear-shot:
the end of a winter's day huddles with them
until it had not occurred, they were not there.
SPA TOWN
They take to the waters here and
still have never been known to walk.
But no one can walk on water
unless a miracle is made,
of walking or of the water.
But then, miracles of that kind
only happen in holy books
or in out of the way places,
without scientific proof.
If love were stronger than it is
instead of as weak as water,
there would be Love Towns everywhere
to which pilgrims could make their way:
if needs be, by walking on water,
as though miracles didn't exist,
or when they always had.
THE WORLD IS FULL OF POWER
The world is full of power:
nation to nation;
and my father to me.
From his heat, the thunder
of nightmares runs across
the sky; his lightning
strikes my heart; his storm
claps sharply as pain.
Lava seeps from heaven
bloodying the night
with the bile of light
he turned on those he
disliked, huddled like
families; and so
I liked less and feared more
in his long shadow.
Up there, he subsides;
down here, he has sentenced
me to wait on death-row,
cowering under a table,
a murderer begging
to put the clock back
to before he was born:
when I had killed
those I wished to love.
AND THE WATERFALL OF YOUR FACE
And the waterfall of your face
looks down on me from blackest space:
I hear the roar through megaphones
of road-drills boring in my bones,
heartbreak fissures deep as miles
where pain endures in grotesque smiles
like earthquakes churning with our fears
till bits of us collapse in tears;
deafened by thunder, lashed by rain,
our lightning strikes us down again,
before the whirlpools suck us clean
until our cries had never been.
Swept-up on the ancient beach,
we are becalmed, have love in reach,
our fingers twisting with relief,
believing turning to belief;
that shudders in another storm:
will darkness ever turn to dawn?
FEAR
The fear I sweat has stopped my death
from light which has nowhere to go,
from the dreadful scorching of flowers
and the short life of butterflies;
shines in brilliant fear of sun-set
coldly on fire, about to die,
and, with it, the ricochet of time
exploding across the sky
into the size of a star;
breathes the fear which has filled my life
with winds stretching a paper bag
of the white-hot circle of the moon
and the flood brooding at its lip;
secretes the metal fear I have
of the railway of the brain,
what it carries, how it arrives,
dragging the body too sweetly
from the blindness of the beehive
or the anthill which cannot hear.
I am turning corners of fear,
holding onto darkness like a dance,
closing my eyes with the thunder
of fear which has yet to come, fear
entered into on being born:
which has to be tasted,
and afterwards, the aftermath
at the back of the throat
which is impossible to taste
which is this city on a Saint's Day,
stopping, retiring, closing doors:
the fear of buildings melting
like icecream silently, its dogs
muzzled, its fathers rocking
empty prams, its children hiding
in grass: is fear of empty
places, of quiet which once made Saints
which fears the thin and dry sand
burning the rain alive
and its red eye slowly
re-opening on namelessness
of mist rising in fear
exactly two feet off the ground,
the sun hiding in the sky,
the sky pouring through the ceiling
of this morning on my fear:
I'm flying too near
a madman's mind,
unthinkable end,
an undiscovered
pact for suicide.
They cancel, like
throwing away October
with no clues.
I was writing
to tell you
of the fear
of writing this.
DARING TO SEE LIKE A YES
Daguerreotype excitements, from our history of watching
their gossamer and rose leaves, are turning to dust in a drawer;
like grief, their sepia dries in stains out of sun-shot, furrows
of sand which finely blow away and collect in corners.
The hiddenness does not lessen in that dark, nor by its dawn,
although sparkling grains, compelling nostalgia, catch our eye
then disappear with sleeplessness, being impossibly called
to be from protected dreams, owls hooting relentlessly at larks.
The colours of memory have been spilled and washed away,
their primary bloom pressed like so many fading scrap-book postcards,
pop-up pictures which remain flat, kaleidoscopes congealed.
It is something much more elemental which produces flowers,
combinations of the earth in movement, a brush-end filled;
when we pass our fingers over the surface of our faces,
feel the skin and smell the life, by walking into it, then
we could also loose the lost chord of blackness, become head-on blind.
The spectrum is our white tears and albino fear of light
lurching in the blink of an eye, daring to see like a yes.
RESURRECTION
On the day that Jesus
rose from the dead,
I was on my back
watching blossom
grow very slowly
from a tree.
It
was quiet as perfume;
exquisitely small
snowballs melted
and formed feathers white
enough to bathe
in like confetti.
Jesus rose today,
certain as backgardens
of floating off
to heaven on these stars
pulling each branch
until they were my arms.
HEARING SILENCE
The sun of us is raining,
the light of us is dark,
from what are we emerging,
and how do we get back?
Somewhere in this room is the sound
my sight once looked upon,
a meeting, a crossing of paths,
leopards arching through wallpaper,
bird-song from the washing bowl,
the door almost open:
or so it says here, so I say.
What do you say, what do you say
from the wastepaper basket,
the other side of the window,
in the owl-ring of the phone?
What we say about it all
is silence
if we hear it.
The door is ajar with prayer
whispered in the stationary
dark, from the brightness of a star.
Suckled by your mother, born
of your father, it settles on you:
taut lines of extreme white upon
your skin and oh upon your life
and blindingly into your eyes.
They, your eyes, look down their sight
or sightlessness for what cannot be seen
dreaming in visions of morning light.
Of neither.
Of both.
Its hair undoes
as tranquilly as lengths of shade,
and falls, in soft sighs, down,
the way we dare not talk
and are not fit for speech.
Our eyes reflect in softened stones,
they sparkle with spring water, tears,
and lie as flat as lakes, as
deeply as ecstatic trance
upon the surfaces of things 
or turn with robber birds in flight
from what they have just seen
or what must not be looked upon.
Their lids close softly as a door.
The words in our mind are cyclones
of little news/
a door creaking shut
on mighty utterances.
Fear of fear trembles in our hands,
the way we were born, then stand,
then walk across a room.
The door is always closed
in fear of the beyond.
I love I love I love I love/
I fear I fear I fear/
I love.
So, do not give me your hand.
Allow me to take it
if I could.
The morning dew is as still;
what quivers is the breeze, our breath.
We are waiting to be blown
like leaves tightly caught on trees.
We pause and cannot move.
We tremble in the calm.
The door is as still as the sky;
is as open as fields.
Your tongue is like morning,
the mouth of the sun.
Your face is of moonlight,
bright cold as your breath.
The white space is pouring,
would wash you away.
Your fingers are the stars
which do not touch themselves.
Your legs are bent in two
like shafts of broken light.
Your feet reach the ground
where the sky turns to sand
Your back straightens at miracles/
then curves again/curves like the world.
Behind the door, all this is real.
While sight floats away on a raft
in an echo of cries,
our eyes are pebbles left by the sea
in crowds along the shore,
in avalanches
crush-barriered from the crack
in the horizon/
underneath/
the door/
being sucked down
by the gravity below
while we/above the water line/
under heaven/
are tossed upon the waves
to & fro/impotently/
seeing.
Our bodies brace themselves
for the dream
which will burst
through broken hinges
and flood the universe.
We are silent when
we talk with angels.
Is what we overhear
through door upon door
the spirit of the world,
the body a bud?
Can we put our hand
straight through ourselves;
can we disappear
on wings with the angels,
soaring infinitely,
the body rising
on weightlessness;
quiver like a bow
shooting its arrow heavenwards,
arcing in resurrection?
The crosses over the earth/
our crucifixions/
our voices like flesh/
yearn for it.
We must be silent
talking with angels
we must hear silence
if we are to speak to it.
BIOPIC
I'd been falling since nineteen
forty nine from a high sea cliff
celebrating my twelfth birthday
with candles like the end of life,
my song torn out in the dried flowers
pressed in a book until they bled.
I no longer dared talk to trees.
I would have been a street killer
but stayed at home by the fireside
watching dreams burn there one by one,
witnessing the daily murders
through quiet, back, prying windows: that
was the smart, troubled thing to do.
I ended earlier than most
because the world went round and round
and my fingers broke with the speed
when someone tried to take my hand.
I didn't have a chance to succeed
without even trying failure.
Now I've learned to reverse the roles:
for night killer read day healer,
for going round and round read stop;
I talk to almost anyone
and listen until we are deaf.
One day I shall write it all down.
I smile easily as they go
as small as photographic dots.
I wish they would take me with them.
THAT CLOSE, THAT FAR
Come nearer, nearer.
Have I
passed you on a bridge
when you did not look up
and I did not look back?
The bridge is there this morning:
there is nothing of our
shadows or our breath.
Below is the river;
nothing is reflected.
There is ahead, twice.
I should have called you
by mistake, and you
answered, by mistake.
We missed each other like air.
We were that close, that far.
LET US NEVER EXPLAIN AGAIN
Let us be greater than we are
so amazing languages occur
like rainbows, stars, a dancing curve
of light and the cocktail of words
smell on our breath, be of bird-song,
bird-wing, sun-glinted, exhaled.
Let us hear those sounds we have heard
in that silence when we have put
a handkerchief to our eyes.
They are higher than ear-shot,
they are solitary as sight,
they enunciate, they give birth.
Let us listen wonderfully.
Let us never explain again.
FROM CHILDHOOD
The names here first named the tree
and the bird upon the branch
about to fly into the sky
while, of course,the cat sat on the mat .
The names missed the point of it all;
they missed the nonnaming of parts;
they missed the unnaming of names.
The words were gathered somewhere else,
in the  somethingelse of a tree,
on the  somethingelse of a branch;
and they did not fly or sit:
they lingered and brooded and hid
in their childhood waiting to start
at the sound of a moth-wing
falling in pollen on their heart
beating with revelations of names.
LAST TENDERNESS
for Jay Ramsay
You, who overhears
hermetic utterance
to penetrate mystery:
somewhere between Carmelite vows
of silence & the absolute
movement in literature
is the sentimental risk
and the real risk;
so, the risks of poetry.
Between the fire & ice is
unsightliness and
the very beautiful.
Between head-on confrontation,
full-frontally, purely
by way of creation,
is the hearing that is left
in eloquence, the tear,
the sight of last tenderness.
THE NEW APOCALYPSE
1.
The First of Spring
Icicles form on the rays of the sun;
and earth stops, frozen in fear to its roots.
All trees are stripped bare, and the sky turns to mud,
clouds fall to the ground breathlessly churning.
Rivers bear birth on slows of quicksand
dripping like semen from a black, dead star;
the moon in its sterilised light goes down.
The instinct between their legs is red raw,
desire bursting with lava of the end
of the old world grinding to a cold stop.
Thunder and lightning blow out of the wind.
What air touches turns to snot, atom bombs
of unbearable darkness, desert light:
locusts feeding on empty eye-sockets,
bats crash-diving into bats with a scream,
waiting nightmares circling round like vultures.
After the cool, the sweat of what remains,
curtains at windows stunned with survival,
the will of God focussing on god knows what:
saliva spat out, blood circulating 
in the shadows like very deep water,
of will-power of animals to raise sap
again from the juice of their spent passion,
mosquitos lusting in pools, stick insects
kissing bubbles, human beings quivering.
The first of Spring is breaking out below;
the battles are over, the wars begun:
terrible flowers are about to rise up.
2.
Heat
Hot as metal, heavy as stone,
sauna shapes ripple down the thermals
in zig-zags filled with boiling air.
They are birds, flat as fired bullets,
tearing holes in their breathlessness,
scalded by sun spots, blistered
by waterfalls of haze,
red-hot clouds scorching their songs.
Closer: silver shines on the face
of buildings, heat upwards and down:
the sky, the centre of the earth,
burning in open windows,
their spaces stifled with the black
of exhaustion, desire silenced.
The search is for oblivion.
What flies seeks the shadows of earth,
what is earth-bound, air bursting:
oases about to melt,
claustrophobia gasping.
The edges of both are slowly
strangling their way along our beds:
changing what sweats there to desert
turning our mirages sun blind.
THE MOTHER OF US ALL
One
1.
First, our death, from birth
of ordinary hope,
its loss (dead bees on
a country floor).
Let
us pray for nothing
in particular;
for everything.
It
is so cold without
our skin and our bones
break easily into
dust which cannot be
kissed.
If love is
forbidden, what is
allowed?
Over the
table where people
live like children sitting
up straight as church spires,
their faces heavenwards,
death and the deprivations
clink below in tea-cups
raised in fear for birth
of the family
continually
about to expire.
2.
â€¦the sun shone on Monday
and there were stars on the
ground (her very old face
as heavenly as the
moonbeam resting on her 
cheek).
Tonight, the sea sounded
so loud I put my hand
outside the window to
bathe it in pure night.
On
Thursday, the same glow of
blue in the sky measured
the light-years close to the
universe of she and
I (what is holiday,
except secrets at the
twilight of each day?).
My
diary this Saturday
showed a very slow walk
past trees and stones and gateways
which the lines on her face
remembered.
I shall
remember them, too, by
turning the pages we
took all that history
ago; and have carefully
stored like an attic chest
for someone, not looking,
to findâ€¦
3.
And so it is, to be, become,
the summer of our retreat
to the bottom of gardens,
meandering while making
our way; never arriving;
and being in this state for
as long as we may, lying
as still as grass, so the memories
behind our eyes cannot fall down
our cheeks like lost tears into
the ground.
If the shade does not move,
we shall be forever and ever,
while butterflies stand guard over
lawns of our peacefully emerging,
our dreams.
4.
I can never forget
that I fell in love with
you; what else is there to
remember?
(My beloved 
is mine and I am his:
we feedeth ).
In the calm
afterwards, in the peace
after the event, your
fingers dusting my arm,
I was complete, I was
joined, I was connected
by a thread to you of
such fragility it
could never break: the silence
as we slept, my whisper
in your ear, our breathing
side by side.
5.
Let us also pray, let us also pray
for reconciliation of how we
are to live day after day in hope, in
hand-holding against the perils, our soft
footprints on sand, a figure we know
appearing: who can see further than their
sight?
From the tops of trees the birds sing of
love and movement; what they sense we also
absorb and desire, wishing it to be
drawn down and to stay.
That night our love makes
bird-songs in our bed like silhouettes; the
curtain of dawn draws back its astonished,
opening eyes.
The first sound is of birth.
6.
Things, then, as they were willed to be:
seconds merging intimately,
minutes gladly yielding ground, what
was confessed at dawn waiting
longingly for another chance:
each measure of time a perfect
length, conception after love,
still-warm memories.
If this is
sanity, then what is madness?
We tried to accumulate: a
butterfly-net catching clouds, arms
taking flight in the sky, seeing
in the dark.
Two
1.
I am not afraid, I am not afraid:
of child-birth, a door closing, my father,
blood in my veins; which are worse than war.
If
I shudder while the children are at school
and re-route a fly walking into
cobwebs, I have done so out of madness
for life, so, sanely, we cannot die.
Whoever does not protect, murders me
and mine.
The meaning of life is a life.
I confess it to the mirrors (come 
unto Him all ye that labour and
He will give you rest ).
I make a wish for time:
time, time, time; for timelessness.
2.
More than usual
sounds are in the air;
there is silence
also waiting to
be heard at the end
of a corridor.
My anxiety
and I will walk there
barefoot.
Otherwise
it is an ordinary
day, the curtains
billowing, house
empty, heart beating.
3.
In the dream, in the dream
was a nightmare, and in
the nightmare a dream sweetly
dreaming: oh, what of the dream?
4.
You closed the door like a surgeon
entering the operating
theatre.
They placed an oxygen
mask on my love and dared me to count
up to ten.
I heard the singing
of birds turn to voices.
You had
the effrontery to die without
a struggle, though it was not
too late, even then.
I thought if
I stared ahead, I might still catch
your eye.
And what was it you had
said to me?
Too little; far, far,
far too much, straight to a lie
detector.
I detected no lies.
You said you would live, then you gave
up like a saint without option;
you, who had fed on me until
I was white.
There was no funeral
by request (you might return at
any time).
I will not remember
if you did, or if you did not.
They have searched for the death
certificate.
They have only
found mine.
5.
i have therefore shed my skin.
i bleed, bruise easily.
i cannot always breathe.
a sword is being pulled out of me.
i am pacified by hands.
when i sleep i always dream.
when i waken i always remember.
i am reaching the other side.
i have passed through all religions.
i no longer need any work.
there are very few words
i have to listen for.
i have messages from the world.
voices are always with me.
the comfort i feel is a light.
the comfort i feel is a light 
which has been in darkness.
i have therefore shed my skin.
(i bleed, bruise easily.
i cannot always breathe.
a sword is being pulled out of me).
6.
Details, details, details:
I can only feel the whole,
faces about to form,
photographs about to smile.
I am not idly seeking
happiness.
Its thread is still
attached to my soul: singular
love from which all loves flow.
Is this, too, only an
alternative, a passing
of the time of day?
It is
also the energy to spawn
in our likeness: we have likeness,
the desire to feel us
in our bones.
And if I re-lived
my life-in-death, I would
change nothing, and especially
not our blossoming, our
particular fruition.
I am looking over
my shoulder.
I am looking
over my shoulder.
I am
looking through photographs
for what is allowed.
7.
What matters is now.
I cannot plan for
now yesterday.
I
cannot remember
tomorrow.
Now should
change itself before
it is too late.
(I know that in the
sunset is the sunrise.
I know that occurs).
(It is their shadows
to which I am drawn:
the back of the day
meeting the front; and
in between a dark
embrace reaching out).
It is the embrace
of now I need; the
now which wakened me
and will kiss me goodbye.
I was perpetual.
I am alone.
THE POLITICS OF EXILE
There is no language left for them;
only silence like hunger,
sight without focus, insomnia.
Seated, they breathe as if running;
see mirages behind them;
walk on crutches, feed on pills.
They are offered life without rest.
They can always go somewhere else
(but never home again).
They can always fall in love
(but not with their sweetheart).
They can always be adopted
(but not by their flesh and blood).
They are not encouraged to dream,
but there is nothing to stop them
aspiring to be someone new,
because they had never existed;
otherwise, they would have
to remain who they really are,
which no one, by now , can remember.
If they continue to mutter
regrets to themselves,
then there is no option
other than to commit them,
out of harm's way, for their own good;
for everyone's peace of mind,
someone has to put them somewhere
as solitary as themselves,
to work out their own way of death.
But if they once acknowledge
the streets outside are paved with gold
and this land made of milk and honey,
then, of course, they will benefit:
they could be let loose, free as birds.
SECRETS
1.
as if horizons held down the sun,
a hand is hiding your face
in fans of arc-light secrecy;
your eyes see each glissando
ricochet on surfaces
of bright, blinding light,
white-hot emptiness without end:
diamond secrets blown like desert sand.
2.
as if the moon fell into water,
reflections of you follow you
along perspectives of the stars
sharpened to an arrow-tip
of infinity, its spotlight
about to be funnelled, liquefied
in the great, velvet dark beyond,
its pin-prick of secrets put out.
3.
as if heaven could be pulled down,
hovering just out of reach of hell,
the universe of secrets meets
in the cool between them both,
in the void where mysteries begin,
where angels make confession
on behalf of me and you,
of everyone with secrets to hide.
4.
as if the secret was still kept
and the silence paused in dark,
whether the answer would be death
or promise of eternity,
split seconds of choice-to-tell remain,
moments of wordlessness,
space before revelation:
which are also as secret.
5.
as if only a god could be told
through prayers flaunted in righteousness,
their special ceremony is poised
ritually by candle-light,
flickering, falling on veils
as weightless as a soul making
shade under a tree: so worship
at another shrine of secrecy.
6.
as if nothing less would do,
while hands reach out for other hands
so each of us can hear,
it is not our precious speech which counts,
but the breeze on which its whisper
safely carries like a kiss
of silence to the unmarked place,
where only secrets can embrace.
WITHOUT YOU
in memory of Jane Bowles
I wonder if I would have cared.
The sky is full of tears tonight.
The weeping of the stars rains down.
How would I have started out.
The sky is diaphanous.
The stars a mirage.
And where would I have gone.
The sky removes itself in dark.
The stars turn off.
I wonder what I would have seen.
The silence of the sky.
The sound of stars.
Would I have known what to attempt.
The sky stays out of sight.
The stars each touch invisibly.
I wonder what I would have hoped.
The sky is alone in its space.
The stars are airless.
And how would I have endured.
The sky is torn in lonely streaks.
The stars are wrecked islands.
Would I have known how to connect.
The sky unlocks its blackness.
The stars merge with their universe.
How would I have tried to be.
The sky is opaque.
The stars link up impenetrably.
I wonder what I would have dreamed.
The sky is further than an eye.
The stars have distant meeting points.
I wonder what I would have loved.
The sky embraces its own arc.
The stars are narcissus.
I wonder what I would have missed.
The sky bereft.
The stars collision.
And how would I have known.
The sky is blinding.
The stars dissolve.
And what would I have been without.
The sky in infinity.
The stars without end.
And how would I have ended.
The sky is made of nothing.
The stars cold-blooded voids.
I wonder what would have remained.
The sky in a velvet cloak.
The stars with a soft smile.
And what would have been my sickness.
The sky is immortal.
The stars cannot die.
I wonder who would have mourned.
The sky without heaven.
The stars without mystery.
CONVERSING WITH INTELLIGENCE
in memory of Mina Loy
Her footmarks to the edge
of sand and sea
pace her anxiety,
dread of being caught
on agoraphobic earth
gasping for the depths
as sea hits rocks,
spits of tears fly
from a shaking head of land.
Scenes made by guile
or ones with clever promises
urge the tides go out,
leave her heart alone
visibly unloved,
white as jellyfish
stranded by decisions,
allowing us to see
how unlovingly
she was decision taker,
now floats beyond reach,
disappearing cries
on loveless horizons,
her shadow hers alone
a pin-prick on the moon
shaped in a crying mind,
cleverness in despair,
a heartless glance forward.
Whoever wants to catch her
will not do so now,
her shadow-boxing,
Dada intelligence.
She chose to unlove
mere saints' miracles,
chose not to love herself,
ecstatically;
and made herself disappear.
DREAMS OF A GIRL
in memory of Marina Tsvetaeva
Alone, I first was sure I was
magnificent, while the public
girl was only a hollow
exclamation mark they desired
so people came running, brought gifts,
swore allegiance and were joyful.
Joyful?
My heart pounded for love,
it broke into lines of a poem
bleeding like a red rose-bud
bursting its lips for want of words.
I can recall rooms, their dark lay-out,
impressions of pictures, cat's milk,
my heart not working any more:
I would have made love to thousands
if I had ever allowed it.
Why don't we live long enough
to be more than amateurs?
MISSING
Everything is understandable.
If you have travelled
on grass or sand,
the marks of you remain
in livid lines upon your face,
words on a page, paint strokes;
and if you have made your way
on harder surfaces
such as love or rage,
your heart will show it
when it finally stops.
Let music accompany you,
make lightning of movement,
inarticulate dance
of thunder and desire,
everything is understandable.
WONDER-GAZING
â€˜Children have marvellous minds.
I hate to see what life does to 'emâ€™â€”
Tillie Olsen,Yonnondio 
Splinters off the moon,
you wrote about these
star-struck, sparkling dreams.
Stars are flowers growing
in the night, you wrote,
and how you would like
to smell the smell of them.
Lamps in houses up
there, you wrote, which
never go out, are
timeless.
People before
have stretched their necks
towards them, like you,
wonder-gazing children
not able to sleep.
Wonder-gazing, you wrote:
what is awesome at
the moment of birth
is not detail,
but wonderfulness.
Wonderful enough
to make you sad for
us all, what you are
as you sit in the grass,
wondering what has
become of the others,
what will become of you.
WHAT IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN
When we were younger than now,
we tried to make our hands
join up in the beauty
and order of this planet,
celebrate the magic search;
and we remembered only the love,
the magnificent legions
of the love of it all,
as we went out, long before
anything was written down.
Now, presuming there had been success,
as though there had been failure,
I cannot believe the truth is here
in this regret, this certainty,
because I have written it down.
Having said, I forget to say
what I always remember
â€” each tear as big as an eye
in the memory of it all â€”
the heroic fountains of struggle,
the spirit still at stake,
the loss of the world still involved
by what is not written down.
LIKE TOMORROW MORNING
1
I feel incredible.
I know everything:
who, why, when, what, where.
I feel incredible:
the morning breeze blows
straight into my heart
like a bugle-call
from heaven; my eyes
are laser-lights curving
the world, piercing the sky.
I feel the passion
of the universe
dancing with me to
the drum-beat of the day.
2
It has faded now.
The furies pass
in seconds.
By
afternoon, I have
to sleep to transform
myself by dreaming
of what was in my
presence: the rainbow
has melted down its
helter-skelter colours,
life on the switch-back,
the fun of the chase, gone.
It is incredible;
like tomorrow morning.
ON HIS 50TH BIRTHDAY
When I speak, I wish to kiss
what I cannot recreate
of the world as fluently
as the rain of its own beauty,
stroke-my-arm-please dreams of it
changing from worse to better,
privacy at breakfast time:
omniscience occurs in sleep
before the dawn, just after dark,
soothing our fatal diseases,
the moon resting on a pillow
like a symbol, empty mirror;
what it reflects is thin, bolt-upright,
tubercular with flashlights
wishing to be fat and calmed,
the act of love acted which
could be described in my head
after the deadly dangers, birth.
I am not sure if it is worth it,
not sure even if it can be done:
to say that the touch of a hand
is like anything I wish to speak
except as primeval noise, a grunt,
my skin painted for war-dancing:
my father would turn in his grave
and my children commit me
for sleeping so intensely;
each of us barks as madly,
and when we waken at teatime
each has a separate excuse,
rushes of guilt flushed out
over a sobering shiver of light.
It is then that the talk should shut up,
soaring birds lift the headache:
mortality creaks like a bone,
thank God, slowly ground into dust,
our skin sags like a deflating
balloon, lightning strikes our eyes.
The thing left on the table
is the untouchable part of us,
the shadow of still life
under an apple, where we were born.
No wonder there are cradles
to rock us in the savage shade
where breathing stabs like a knife,
until we cry from being slapped
and are beckoned into the light
of others' fragile comforts.
I have felt this diaphanous tug
before of silk attached to us all,
curving like kite string from a cloud:
when it breaks, one of us falls down
and those remaining watch the alarm
ripple slowly along the skeins
and sigh with relief when it stops.
What we are left with wishes to kiss
speech with re-creation, bringing
aloneness together for company,
the green in the fields gathering
after or before a storm:
there, the trees, I, stand anciently,
generations changing, man's view
exhausted by its purity.
I see the need for love hovering,
the need for identity,
when the rain is falling in tears
and every promise broken;
when at first it has nothing to do
with anyone, then everyone,
when all we want is the meeting
to clarify we are still cared for,
or if not cared for, remembered.
What I remember is the face
of those of who are unloved or tired
with the acts of loving which grow 
from childlike simplicity
to waiting like a child to be kissed.
Embrace me as that child today;
we have travelled far together,
our weaknesses have been exposed,
our desire for rest as limitless
as the wishes we make to the sky.
INFLUENCE
Tell me the truth, the why or what truth, tell
it, you countries, these colours of green,
what you have seen of bodies and of eyes
rolling in worship, smiling like call girls:
who still taste the holy ghost in rain, or
worry that border towns will refuse you
entry from your madness; tell me what peace
you miss through the electrified fence, no
one knowing your home, where you are about
to be laid to rest or to awaken,
your sight ice-cracking and cradled
in abandoned seas, changes never marked.
A lot goes into question marks, saying so,
inventing coherence without rhyme while
misfitting, covering, submerging
for life-times, especially from each other;
so touch me with the memories you've made
and re-enter the how of re-making,
with each what and why and each forever
influencing the pull and sway of us:
moons of silent happenings, birth re-traced,
long shadows love-making into their light.
And who sees who, the one of each of us?,
except in what we have said before, said,
spoken, remembered and said again, speech
that mimics and mimes the murders as well 
as the dignities, rehearsing the play,
memorising drama, the curtain call;
we think, therefore we are; are comforted
to start and also to know when we end:
the street names, the logic of our sharing
syllables of identity, the end
always too late to begin again or stop,
and preposterously never-stopping,
pathetically, all too humanly:
as it is written in scriptures of hope,
that heaven could never be on the earth.
I therefore want news of the street-walkers
before they are arrested, news of children
wending their restless way in crocodiles,
of all travellers changing direction,
joyfully warlike, brandishing their hearts,
incandescence reclining in their bones:
about to leap, to skip, to genuflect,
their bodies pared to body's essentials
which would show greetings, fears without a word;
and, transplanted, grafted from the marrow
in the bone, be as they have never been
before, to me, to you, to all of us
and to themselves, remembering themselves,
in life-supporting mysteries we share;
of influence which must not go away,
forgotten extremity which lives on.
HERE IS A CHANCE
Here is a chance to stay
in the language for a time
for that time exactly
when even old-fashioned flowers
are without end and forever
and we do not dare to finish
being with each other.
Here is a chance to complete
one more day at a time
when that time exactly
becomes a poem or a self
before we are finalised
before we are abandoned
and cannot be older.
Here is a chance to be
and be unfinished
neither poem nor self.
TRIPTYCH
1 THIS IS MY TERRITORY
â€˜The Indians were also defeated by terrorâ€™â€”The Viceroyalty of Peru, 1532â€“1825 
for Jenny
1.
Beauty will save the world,
but not our dying:
it is a weekday
afternoon and the light
beats down like truncheons
on a black shadow
in the golden shine
of the gleaming sun's
shimmering knife-edge
of heat sharp enough
to amputate hands,
arms, a head, mankind,
while melting the heart
to excrement.
Gods came here one morning
like deer whose antlers
touched the top of the world,
and the gold in our eyes
poured onto the ground;
and our earth-mother trembled
as mere men began their rape.
We still feel that shudder
of robbery in our bones,
deconsecration of ourselves,
and, with it, paradise.
The disfigurements continue:
on the same day that a law
is passed to allow us to be,
one is passed to cancel we
who must take a place
in the silence of things
waiting for poetry.
And the anxiety,
the anxiety quickens:
we are told inequality
is the condition of things;
and so there must be order
laid out like cemeteries,
where disorder can rest.
Thus, the iron bars
of night fall in bruises
patterned on our skin
like messages of fear,
grunts of terror
inflicted blindly
till the dumb cry out.
And the hooded church
laments in awful
songs of worship
on our silence,
silence when we must
swallow down last rights
like gasps of air
sufficient to exhale it:
so that others can breathe.
2.
We are this simple: that
we eat as little
as a child so that we
will not grow into men.
We are this simple: that
we put out our necks
for the rope to enclose them
because in that is sacrifice.
We are this simple: that
out of reverence we defend
miracles, so that ancient
revelations cannot be
murdered by murderers.
We are this simple: that
the mountains are the sea,
that the sky is the earth,
that silence is the song
and the shadows which fall
rise up again with the sun.
We are this simple: that
the flowers of the world
and their bloodstained beauty
live longer than death.
We are this simple: that
we, also, are dying for life.
2 NEVER GETTING OUT
Walking toward
a revelation
through summers
of lilac words,
I keep on thinking
I will never get out
and I fancy I see
mountains swaying
like fields of poppies;
that walking toward
them is to risk them
turning to mirages
thirsting for somewhere
on earth that is not
somewhere else, but
exactly where they ought
to be and where I am;
and not only we
would know our place, but
any woman clutching
her shawl, any man
and woman holding hands
caught in the mystery
of what must happen
next and where: a river,
slope of a hill, seashore;
breathing the landscape down,
not only for life-support,
but also for miracles,
because both will never
occur again.
3 ROTTING MORE SLOWLY
Worms in our dreams
of why we are
and what we worship:
is it a crime
not to inform
on our neighbours,
not to drop down
on our knees in guilt?
We make base idols
evangelically.
We face final
subjugations,
when every inch of
a body is bruised,
drowned in filthy water,
immersed in pain
and hangs upside down 
in order to know:
who are the stupid,
who are the small,
whose life drags on uselessly;
and who are the clever
and in the prime of life.
Tyranny breeds martyrs
as never before:
to moral comfort,
the sensation
of being right,
easy obviousness
and their temptations:
so that we shall rot
more slowly.
AS WE YEARN FOR PEACE
Give me a kiss
which will close my eyes:
war is coming.
In wartime, we dream
our youth grows
into all of us;
summer blossom,
snowflakes,
blades of grass:
we count them
separately
like individuals;
we are personally
involved.
We can do anything
for anyone.
And when a bullet
kills by accident,
a hand is severed
from the arm,
an eye is blinded
from the sight
of all people;
and each death changes
our destiny:
that, we know, in war.
Murder by war
reminds us of those
we never knew
and who bore
our future
within them.
Give me a war kiss
for life, for birth,
for carrying the world
inside ourselves;
as we yearn for peace.
THE DREAM
What things could have been done
what things could have been like
what things could have been known:
the first, the final
flowerings of happiness,
those times loved the best
and those that were last seen;
and people, the people
coming forward like buds,
casting shadows like trees.
Of course the leaves fell
and the winds rustled us
in shivering streams
out to the ice-cold sea
and beyond to deserts
where moon and sun collide,
where life is hard as death.
There are no photographs
to mark the way of it,
except in people's eyes;
there are no words to show
the sound of it all,
except on people's breath;
and in our flashing dreams.
I am about to dream
just where I have fallen,
on the place that holds us:
isn't that enough
to go by, after all these years?
I feel the water flow
over passing faces.
And when I waken
will everything be there
as if it always had been?
The waterfall pours down
in rainbows of light;
I'm trying to find your hand
in the spray and thunder
for all of us to hold,
for life to take its grip.
And will you be alone
if at last we touch?
Oh, tell me how things have been,
tell me what you have seen.
KEATS' NIGHTINGALE!
KEATS!
I was unique before he
told me that in Africa
the peach tree is nothing more
than an ordinary weed.
A peach tree!
A weed!
So I dreamed I was holding
the trunk of an oak tree on
the loveless journey back home.
Though peace descended; though
beautifully rounded vowels
formed in me, I wakened up
suddenly on hearing Keats'
nightingale sound like the roar
of motorway traffic.
Keats' nightingale!
Keats!
I knew at once I had never
had any identity,
and I thought of a man who
did not dare or did not care
to remember himself or
if he'd loved or liked himself,
or if anyone had loved,
or anyone had liked, him:
because the answer was nothing,
the answer was nowhere.
What of him?
What of me?
NEARLY THERE
Because she is music
and I listen to
her finger tips flying
from the deep of her voice
to where I am silent,
she has hushed me.
While I am near her,
the notes in her heart
become clouds or flowers
which I only hear;
I speak only to say
I cannot catch them:
The wind in the trees
is as passionate,
as come and go, as
marvellously angry
as the voices of people
who only have talking left
Her music plays on,
plant, body, animal,
into a dreaming child,
two hands conducting
the air for bird-sound;
then a girl filling her dress,
moth of song, of whispers,
the gleam in her hair
a woman humming:
stars from her mouth sing
in perfumes, colours;
butterfly wings stretch
with desire to fly;
earth-notes of music
murmur in gathering
storms of pleasure, bliss:
beginning like a kiss
of tongues trying to move
their lips in slow speech
while listening out
for the first breath of air
making sounds like these,
of no words at all.
V
ASK ANY STRANGER
Many light-footed animals
pace up and down: visitors
from the hills of innocence
beyond the skyline, softly calling
like water, lips kissing the earth:
and this is not a dream of heaven,
nor a vision of paradise;
this morning is not in a book,
it is not painted on a wall:
any stranger will tell you that.
In the afternoon, there is death;
what is on the horizon
stays there like a blurred face
agonising, miming nightmares
over the red roar of desert
silence where there had once been pools
of life, and, with it, screams, rage,
the awfulness of human change:
any stranger will understand.
What we have lived for is the dark
when we think aloud to ourselves.
It takes a hundredth of a second
to create the world, an eyeblink,
without using a single word,
without so much as a sign:
what happens is a lullaby,
a moon's enraptured stare:
any stranger will tell you so.
Of course, we might dream of questions,
comforts from a sleeping pillow,
for the human race, ourselves,
panaceas from a bed,
from a face which looks up and smiles;
the questions here answer themselves:
in single tears of happiness
when too much love was only
just enough to make the world go round:
any stranger knows that is true.
If the feelings are inside,
so is the flesh and so the blood;
but what of the head in the clouds?
They must combine even to glance
over a shoulder long enough
for desire, for the human heart
to quicken and for it to slow.
What stays is the length of life
coming in, receding like the sea,
a speck bobbing on the waves:
now we are closer, now far off.
Any stranger knows that well.
This is the shape of our shape,
on the surface, under the skin;
this is what our hearts try to trace
as we put our mind in our hands;
and it all happens each moment
without fail and forever:
ask any stranger, ask anyone.
BIRTHDAY GREETINGS
for Jenny
It is her birthday
and she dreams of stars
seeing the world
in a human face
which was once in love.
Will it burst with love
again, like colours,
speech that catches fire,
tears of revelation
from infinity?
The angels don't know.
But I do know that
it is her birthday.
She is beginning.
Words there are made flesh
so I may touch them
and she can feel it.
That is how we are born.
FIRST-HAND, SECOND-HAND
First-hand things pour down:
pin-prick sheep on the
hillside blossom blown
off trees shadows
falling in their own
particular way
lives before they die.
Second-hand bestow:
fingers focussing,
a dream blinking, eyes
calculating and
the body's mind
creating birth from
fresh air: to arrange
the shape of life
again and again.
First-hand survive;
second-hand live on.
One needs miracles for prayers;
the other, gifts for the gods.
LISTEN
in memory of W S Graham
Silence: he knows about that;
silence of the life-cycle,
butterflies in his head
and in his body, too:
what would crawl out,
how would it fly?
Would he be able to fly
(the walls of rooms close in)
would he be able to move
a hand, finger, a word?
He has worried for years,
to the point of death.
He became silent with space;
friends knew that exactly,
to whom silence was golden
like sharp, gleaming jewels, hard as love:
from which impasse he came.
Would he see the bird rising?
Would he hear the centre of the earth?
Strangers stared ahead ecstatically,
or some were calm, burning
like the black moorland burns
before it is swept by rain.
Memory is too slight a word:
his origins bury on
downwards into any heart,
blindly coming up for a breather
and silence changed to sound:
where the butterfly is calling
his name, calling his name
until his tears fall down,
wings of silence in the air.
Listen, he then says, listen:
the butterfly is calling
my name, calling my name;
oh, my love, my love, what shall
I be now the butterfly
is calling my name?
At that place of silent sound,
his origins are being called,
being called by name.
CUT
Cut out the sun:
its heat remains.
Cut out the view:
you hear the trees.
Cut out the mind:
you feel the grass.
Cut out the mind:
you touch the sky.
Cut out the mind:
you'll run as blind
as water
Cut out blindness:
see the words,
their songs like birds.
Cut out the words:
they fall like tears,
rain down your face.
Cut out the words:
silence like fields.
Cut out, cut out:
the vertigo
is falling down,
its rush of air
begins, begins:
too quick to see,
too slow to touch,
diaphanous;
although we kiss,
we cannot tell.
Cut into dream
that would have been.

dedication verse
Past the impasse, you showed me â€”
The dragon in the foreground,
And the castle ahead â€”
And no way but past him, into
His belly, Parsifal
Wear the old skin, until it
Cracks open â€” and the blackness
Breaks to gold: was that it?
Yes: and I am that salmon
You saw, swimming upwater
And as gold as the Word is
In Love, and fire, and water
There is only the source
And the river â€” only the sky
And the upstream-forever
Arc of unending Light.
Epiphany 1990
1.
Early gold days,
Butterfly yellow â€”
Pale gold behind the painâ€¦
As the New Year sheds its radiance:
The New Year then is now,
The new days have already come.
the thread
2.
The landslide moves without a sound:
You watch the words fall,
Black into blackness
'By law of inner space to find
the real beginning', you whispered.
And so you came into the desert
To find the zero of your emptiness,
The one clear circle â€”
The one, clear, only circle
Embracing you.
3.
Fathomless unknown,
Behind and in everything â€”
Valley â€” kestrel â€” celandine:
You nowhere, and in everything â€”
And being nothing, being silenced,
Being unable to speak
You see every thing,
And I see You
And I see I am
The core I am seeing:
The sun closening
To meet the man
Who has crossed the line,
Who has walked out of himself
Stands ahead there,
Naked in the light.
4.
The naked flame is all you come to:
And not even that
The candle will not light.
Twice, its wick collapses in wax.
You dig it round again, gouging deeper â€”
You dig into a mirror
As you are dug into
Ruby red heart, and the seal in this:
In the deepest dark, all you are
Is stripped: soul, spirit, all of it
Before you can see the undying flame
And all you are like a darkness around it;
Before you can come into the blaze of light,
White-cloaked, wreathed (to their
Joyous waiting faces)
Newly clad in soul and flesh â€”
Christed â€” initiate.
5.
Day rose with its small pale petals,
And bright little stamens of sun:
And shall we all come out of the ground like daisies?
Day rose, for one day only
So say the heart, like that, gathers no dust
And say love, that parts every petal's falling
Parts, and blossoms, and breaks us â€”
And everything must pass.
Oh sun in our hearts.
6. for Lizzie
Ghostly shimmering factory horizonâ€¦
Sea-estuary edge.
Borderline of water.
Low energy zone.
You sit up,
Sketching it â€”
We could be anywhere.
Clear blue sunblaze of air surrounding,
The slow, insistent rhythmic clank of metal â€”
And a peewit, hovering near
Thanking only the light â€” to find it inside
With its dew-like stained beads of oil;
To find a layer of slime the sun
Has never seen or touched â€”
Bared, open, for healing now
A black barge sail's passing
â€” the oyster catchers' calling â€”
And the peewit, blue-sweet, over me.
7a. for Bill Lewis
Your gold brave shirt
And the blue moon risingâ€¦
â€” a gold, clouded O of mist.
(haiku)
7b. for Jane
Blue moon burning like a midnight sun,
Red sun â€” red eclipse â€” red apocalypse,
Glimpsed high above the buildings:
â€” but in the secret garden, hidden
Behind the wall of a black hedge, under blossom,
We nestled on a blanket as innocent as children,
And a cat scratched its claws against the tree,
And we listened to the breath-
Of-the-being-of-the-breeze;
And your heart had found its place:
Sitarist of the sun.
7c.
In the deep relinquishing,
Bowed head to heart â€”
Naked shoulders and arms
Above a red encircled cross you see
There are still clouds around you,
Remnants of a bird of prey
That would eat your soul,
Forcing a result â€” but no,
As you let its wings die
And its whipping eye go blind
You enter the threshold
And you remember
Apollo's birth in a pool of gold.
the narrowing
8. for Diana
Rooks floating restless
as if before a storm â€”
The roar of the wind, remembered;
And over the moor, you receive His Word
You whisper the source in jagged spurts,
And the birds scatter, and the wind becomes a dream.
9. for Lesley
And the moon in the dark in a still-daylight sky,
With you, sitting under this oak â€”
With the stillness of the trees, silhouetted
And the breeze, and the far bleating of sheep
Up on the hillside;
The moon above the hill cut like a wedge of shadow,
And the trees, the trees alive in their darkness
And the moon the width of a V in the cloud â€”
And how much gentler we are, like children
Armourless in the trust of the night
And it is no longer raw between us
All the power we had is love, now
And love is the only work there is
And this time when you take my hand
It is hesitantly â€” but we are old friends,
We know that now
And we heal farther past than we can see;
We are healed, face to face
in the soft night breeze
by heart, by hand
10. for E.
Your voice, from the past
Rung â€” or wrung
Into speech: I don't know
You are right
To be uncertain,
To be
mistrustful â€”
Who am I to say?
But I fear you are dying
What is yours to live
In a bitter backwater
Of unforgivingâ€¦
And all I know is
You live behind a green door,
And the door is your heart;
Don't â€” don't close it.
11.
These days, you say, with nothing holding â€”
(It is the page you saw, turned tissue thin)
Time, time is no longer holding us
And no one holds the shaman, he is alone
I am alone before the miracle of the sun,
And these knife-like rock striations
And you face this unturned corner
Of your despair â€” you know
Something has to break: you are afraid it is you
And it is rage, rage at the un creation
And it is water, pouring troughed into a stream
And you are spinning â€” and the ground 
Is spinning round you â€”
You spiral to the only ground there isâ€¦
(And it is strange, bright, daylight-strange
â€” days that hold nothing but themselves â€”
And you forget
Things that days ago took up all you were,
Vanish into space, into  millennia :
One day, you will remember it all â€”
When the coffin breaks, and spills you onto the shore.)
12.
(the city swirls around like a great beast,
it swirls and coils â€”
it swerves, sounding â€”
It is a black dragon: one tooth is a car radio
blaring, passing â€” another is a motorbike
without a silencer, revving
on past up the road â€”
And its breath is an aeroplane roaring overhead,
fang-jawedâ€¦its eyes full of stocks and shares,
towerblocks, glass windows reflecting neon â€”
against a darkening sky â€”
and its eyes
are exhaustion, clinging-on-to-the death, desperate:
they are your own, and you believe your eyes)
13. for J.
In a white flash
All we are is together
Past and future, forever
Francis and Clare, and
Benedict â€” oh Beloved:
We are becoming each other,
Silently â€” and it is Him
And only Him that can hold us
At this apex, above us:
Between us: or me, like a fool
Like a tower, from falling
Wide open at your feet
To rebuild myself, unselved
Stone by stone out of all
Your lightning shattered â€”
As it had to.
14.
Icarus falls and falls and falls,
And then, it seems, the most he can be
For a time, is a labourer pushing the lines together
Like long steel trolleys on the factory floor.
now
15.
You stand in a garden
With grass and trees around you â€”
It can be sunlit and flower-bright
And it can be wild â€” your shadow
Standing in front of brambles, as if at twilight
Is dark, too, and you cannot see his face:
Your own truth is what grows from the root upwards.
16. after 'The Master'
The echo of your voice, that stuns:
To see, deeper than eyes
With what rises â€” when we were sun, gold
When we were mist, Atlantis, dreaming, continuous â€”
In a trance where the body remembers what it was;
From under the blackness, from the belly upwards
Curved, like a bell, with its womb-light of crystal:
And now?
As you are risen, it is new kingdom come.
17.
Wings glinting in the sun-gold light,
Seagull-white, as they flyâ€¦gold seeps:
And it is when the stillness comes â€”
Your breath steadies, and the round circle
In the belly begins to answer,
And it is a sun: and it is light, spreading
Up, inside, and around you â€”
â€˜So you are seeing through sunâ€™,
As the birds' bellies glint, high above
The moor's edge, flying
together
in perfect formation)
Edge
18. for Carole
What was the rain
And is now your face â€”
Clear, light, great-eyed, innocent:
Your round face, your loving face;
Holy Spirit, you are a woman now
And She is you, here, beside me.
(after Cecil Collins)
19. for Jenny
the stone in my palm
spells a wave, breaking
I breathe at lastâ€”
I can hear the sea
20. for some of the artists I know
You said remember the child you were
And the child you are is the joy of God,
And so be loving, be open-hearted â€”
And in the chapel I saw us standing
We stood in a circle like sheaths,
And the sheaths were our names, our identities
And one by one we shed them, we stepped forward
We stepped into the love we are beyond them;
And we came forward like parts of a single white flame.
21.
Out of the belly of the whale,
Out of wrestling with the angel,
Out of the smallness of the child,
Out of failure, grey, and a broken flask
Out of the womb of your wounded heart
Returned to the nothing it seemed you were,
Comes a man you barely recognize â€”
Whose face is more your own that it has ever been;
As he comes over you, no longer as a mood
But a
knowing â€”
and it is him you turned
Away from, refusing to surrender
Even as you balk to name him: who else?
But as yourself, now
and why?
Because he is a king.
22. for my mother
You came in light
You were waiting for me;
You came into my body
I only knew you as you left â€”
Knew it was you now
As light as you were, then
As you opened my heart in your going
As you said:
â€˜Only be the brightness of what you areâ€™.
23.
Gold above the cloud, and the cloud's head
Spread, shining out
its last raysâ€¦
Drawn slowly down into the cloud's white,
And white that was womb and was invisible
Reddened,
and the horizon that was under it,
And the road that sped southwards,
faced into it;
And was rose red, and all you are in me â€” was
Coming down
to the rim of the cloud's edge,
And came out, and was round,
rose, rose,
the rose sun!
24. for A. R.
At the harvest of time:
You dream of barns filled with golden grain,
Deep inside you â€” in the bright dreaming sea
That flows between all of us, beyond boundariesâ€¦
Christian, Buddhist: Bard, Indian and Cathar â€”
To no longer have to be one of these â€”
But in the New Mind, making each our own, each of us;
And it is r.a.i.n.b.o.w.
woven and out of the old strands
That were walls, thrones, dogmas and dominions
of one God.
the doorway
25. for Naomi
Painting the rainbow:
Streaked from its flaming primal sun-height
Down into its blue, indigo, mauve ocean-depth â€”
Beginner's mind: to feel each colour in its rising,
Spread, from side to side, across the dampened paperâ€¦
(Slowly from each tube-squeezed & mixed white hollow)
Holding the brush how like-unlike a pen â€”
As they border to each edge and blendâ€¦merging, now
Yellow-green â€” where the lightest touch is enough â€”
Or too much: to learn to see the colours in-between,
To sense the white they cover, beyond separation â€”
Drawn into their silence a bee fills, hummingâ€¦
Pure, intense, and strangely everywhere around you
But at the point of the brush: you paint your being,
Your body into them and out like blood;
You flow in the veins of an Unending Body,
And you walk out into its effortless creation.
The poem is a door: and the poem is you.
26. for Keith Jarrett
You let the devil in, little Rilke
The way you half-sit, half-stand, and sway
Your arms either side of your hands â€”
Over the piano you make love with!
Half-serious, half-clown â€” master
You know the rejected cornerstone,
The darkness we hide and deny
In the name of God is Godly, is a dancer
Is a flame of light and dark
Beyond all contradiction â€” that dares
To play without a score, that risks
Itself beyond mere self control
And so gives its all,oh , to the last
Exquisitely timed quivering trill â€”
And stands, like you, quietly pausing
Polishing your glasses on a large white cloth,
Under the raining glad applause.
R.F.H.
27.
â€˜Soft porn for the distraction of the nationâ€™
The cheap poster's trigger: and then the dream
Turns it around, it turns it all around:
White Neptune, exalted â€” the earth from space
In its pearl-swathe of clouds:
AND NATION SHALL DISSOLVE INTO NATION
The prophecy of the pearl, realized
In what you can see of the earth,
And literally
(the way angels see)
The wall.
All the wallsâ€¦
come down.
28a.
The drifting after-dark cloud,
Still crimson-bellied in the skyâ€¦
And the cloud packed like ice,
Is a glacier of light
(drawn under the brightening
spell of the moon)
28b. for J. R.
Your burnt face
Scorched in the fire,
Puer of rage â€”
Narcissus of suffering
Your face is your heart,
Your face is cracking
Out of its mask:
Now may you blaze
And bless, and be blessed:
You are someone new
You are someone
You have never been.
29.
And the river water blue, by the angle of the light â€”
Thames-blue â€” as the new floats inâ€¦in fragments
Blue as the sky â€” as the tide drifts towards usâ€¦
And the bottles come bobbing into view, and byâ€¦
â€” transparent, empty: with no message: but empty â€”
As they catch the light, and the water is silken
A canoeist's oars slide upstream into:
Epiphany blue, river-light-sky.
And now, the future.
30.
And you are kneeling in a field
At the beauty of the sky â€”
It has brought you to your knees
And someone from long ago
So long, he may even be dead now
Is riding round and round you
On a horse.
31a. for Jeannine
Let the breath
Breathe you â€” out, and out, and out
Let go;
As the wave's water washes in
To breakâ€¦and recede;
Let go, let go, let go
Be the wave, be the shingle
And the wave's sound
Deeper and deeper felt and seen;
Then you will know
You are coming,
You are coming home.
31b.
I breathe in clarity;
I breathe out confusion and desire.
the circling
32.
(And the earth is shaking:
not for the first, or the last time to come â€”
there is a certain weather, and it is grey, so you know
that somewhere in the world it is coming to pass:
And will we one day know, as one, every second
that is birth and dying? felt among all of us
as we are, each, the earth: blood, fire and belly: just
as we read, as we will, the living air?
Already it is here, and you know it:
you know the agony of the room beginning to turn,
and then spin â€” kitchen table and bench upended â€”
poised as we waited for the sound of breaking glass,
and mortar, ceiling, street, and all of it â€”
And it was only a dream, and there is no such thing
as â€˜only a dreamâ€™ any more)
33. in time of the warp
Sunset and moonrise prepared it.
(The sun, red, through the arms of a beech;
And the moon with its aureole was a white sun,
Haloed in darkness, banded by colour â€”
Never before so purely itselfâ€¦)
(Saturn-Neptune)
â€¦invisible conjunction in the daylight air,
Of shadow planets, mirrored on their axis:
Daylight mist air, dissolving air â€”
Half-seen-unseen, sensed, in your eyes' flesh
And behind them, there, in the same sky
Where the stars drill down,
and swim down,
dance-down
And the past is no longer holding, only holding on.
Every fresh beginning ends up swampedâ€¦
There is that much to empty.
The words cramp.
The words grow smaller, and they run together
They slide sideways, and end up everywhere.
You take a fresh white sheet and rewrite them
In lighter and larger black.
Lighter, and fainter until they float
As the air begins to fill them
(And they shift, sheaved out of sight
and of your mind.)
(Tennyson)
Your eyesâ€¦although your hair first
Long, lank and grey where you are standing â€”
Your face a mist of partly whited-out exposure â€”
By a graveyard wall, covered in ivy.
Your eyes drawn down to the bitter earth.
Ivy and bone-dust, Death and the dank earth
Your black print echoes, there, at the lowestâ€¦
And the women, bare, statuesque sketched prisoners
And you stand like a prisoner 
And your eyes, your eyes are staring
Grief-maddened with unspeakable
feeling-Behind all your mellifluous lines: your eyes:
And somehow you know that time has gone
In this strange crack of days, and you are calling
Calling to a distant undreamed-of son
While the veils are down:
Release me, release me, release me.
(And your book is in my hands: why burn it?
Because my soul, my soul is trapped in it)
Your eyes, and mine, burning by candlelight.
(over the bardo)
The moon, high in the fog.
The door is open.
You slipped out, and now you gaze up into it â€”
You stand, and suddenly you know
This is only a chapter you are going through
A brief parenthesis of blackness
A Wall Of Paradise this side of the bluenessâ€¦
And then the moon draws you forward, fast-forward
In the luminous cloak of each skin of your life
And you are old, and at the height of it â€”
And you will hold each thread as part of stars and planets
And suns, worlds within worlds of light unfolding;
From threshold to threshold of light â€”
And, you, there, at each of them: imagine
No, see it is so, and be with the joy of it
And even dying, you will say: dying, as you are
In your frail, Belsen-thin body
â€˜Heaven is here, but this is strange
I am going somewhere elseâ€™
13â€“17.11.89.
34.
Closer and closer into the (pure, blue) moment
Seeing (as-I-see-it) pieces of a jigsaw
Against a sky as intense as it is clear (blue, and
Always bright); and only graduallyâ€¦seeing
More and more, each time, of the rightness of it â€”
The pieces like land mass (or speech, perhaps)
And the blue? all our wonderings and pauses
â€” to see â€˜it all fitsâ€™ the closer we come here:
Each step ahead of, and to ourselves, unendingly
Beyond what we can say/feel/or finishâ€¦and always
Drawing us deeper and deeper into its brightness â€”
Each new morning (whether through rain or mist
As-it-is â€” forever-never fixedâ€¦)
And to see what sees the cloud through your eyes â€”
Or my eyes â€” sees love, and sees love.
The Northern Lights!
35. for Alison
Because you know
That however you were born
And what it means to have borne it,
To have to bear â€” abort â€” miscarry
(And see, and seed, and conceive it again)
To feel, as you said â€˜I'm going to split right openâ€™
Mother Of God.
as we all are: mediators here:
Now all we've known of death
is becoming birth
Because we are here
to give birth to it;
And all our births
are its birthing â€”
36.
The moon, halved, still, waiting
By a wishbone of cloud:
And if you ask me what I'm hoping for
â€” I'll tell you.
All of it.
37. for Alice
You go beyond gold to silver: mirror
You leave your flame and your name behind
And I fear for you, standing there on the shore
With that wave coming in about to break over you â€”
I fear you are being taken from you â€”
But then I hear the voice, larger than all illusion
â€˜Wherever you are in Love, I will find youâ€™
And it is no more yours or his than mine.
Speak, child.
Speak, child.
Speak, child.
38. for C.
Butterfly man makes love with butterfly woman.
They are honey that wells from the rock together.
In the room stands an angel, watching over you
He is bowed in light, winged in a blaze of ghost:
He is, or was, arms spread: nailed in red
And the wings he has now began in his heart,
And as he stands, he too becomes a butterfly.
39. for C.
Ground down as we are â€”
Ground down so uncertain and unknowing â€”
But then as you reach out your hand,
Then, as your eyes meet mine, I see youâ€¦
And you are standing, small there, in the light
And you are naked, with it shining back through your pubis
Your skin translucent â€” as you face forwards â€”
With a joyousness that only a child could understand;
As you stand.
poised to jump, the pure spark of you returning
To span a gulf that only your uttermost trust can cross â€”
And she will (she has), and now â€”
impossibly â€”
she does.
the break
40a. for Amy
It is the moving breeze
that half-catches in your breath.
On the shortest, deadest day â€”
everything is alive
That robin's
full-throated singing
up in the sycamore's
vertical!
You come to me, and I cannot speak
You come to me, and all I can say
is: listen
We stand on the threshold
of letting it in
through the sunlight
the tree-light,
grass-light
â€” or we block it out:
Grinding on in the little mind
The clinging-onto, the self-mind.
Do you want to cross over?
When you let go, you must let go
of this also â€”
Before it can come down, before you can rise
rinsed, receiving, child.
See how it teems
in white wings â€”
Gull-wings â€”
reflecting it,
And in the cut-back rose beds:
Stemmed to the end;
And in the Palace Of Glass
Whale-ribbed,
shiningâ€¦
Rebuilt, empty
â€¦to house the New.
40b.
And on this free dayâ€¦
You, Mozart, you
every note of you
Like a great star-burst
shimmering formation
Rayed in colour,
spread wide,
pulsatingâ€¦
â€” for the joy of it
Swept up through our ears â€”
Down the years, and there are none,
You are always thereâ€¦
Your gift emblazoned â€”
your soul passed on
â€” anytime we can listen
Or attune to you, and anywhere â€”
Or you remind us, as-suddenly
fresh-as-you-are
Bright blue messenger â€”
Of what you came for
to bring down
gold
-winged dust
like lightning!
You, finest of fanned breezes, vans, heralding
The newness in us that won't be denied â€”
Such a showering that only the first
Of all mornings' light echoes
in its brimming rim
Of upthrust
outpouring
You race to meet
and quicken
and scale
The mountain
At the heart of light
Keyed in ecstasy
â€” your strings drawn
Across the skin of my heart
stretched taut
to soaring
Scudding â€”
shuddering â€”
silver peaks of sound
Lark-peaks; upward â€” and free-falling
â€” behind eyes gone into a stillness beyond dancing
You raise me
unwrapped
and unfolded to 
Your naked,
pure felt
in-streaming fountain
Inexhaustible well-head
Generous friend
â€” You, sharp-tongued for the truth
You wild and unfearing,
Piper to the sleeper
You lover above all things
Avatar of excellence
grace-given
to exult in
â€” and share
never hoarding â€”
So that even in the dark of your broken spirit
You blazed white into your ending
As your voices chorus their vertical shout
Through the rushing jet-flood
rising
Unprevented â€”
Even in the ice of the mystery
(your burning forehead
your last faint whispering)
â€” betrayed, unpaid, bird-like, returning â€”
You, unfinishable poem
You sliding into no one 's grave
Leaving the splendour unpossessed. and His 
That nothing can stand in the way of
and no one can
(no scheming, sad egoic husk can)
You, lighter than a feather â€”
the way you laughed yourself awayâ€¦
the landing
41.
The sea, now: soft aquamarine blue-green
To brown waves; and the tide is going out, out
And the air is warm.
And it says come down onto the wet pale sand,
Come down into the picture.
And you do, you do slowly: feeling your resistance,
You could pace it out as the length of a grave.
It is the future you are walking to.
You know that now.
The shingle like a small hill behind you,
And the waves ahead.
Come to the edge.
Leave the rest behind.
Your death, behind.
And the sand is bright.
This is the step.
The message waits
At the waves' edgeâ€¦and there, then, they
That were walking, fly â€” they fly, each one, white
Across your eyes â€” one by one, winged in stillness
as if soundless;
Each one forward and in company, crying silently
Past the moment of flight to landing
Vivid under the grey, their own colour â€”
And they are gulls they are invisible they are human
And they go one way, into Life.
42.
â€˜Tell me, is it just a song
Or shall we live it?
Tell me about the things
You've secretly yearned to be â€”
Now the cracks are widening in your face
Come, we can do everything we've dreamed;
We're alive, we're awake â€”
And the sea is beside us
And the miles of beach,
And we are alone here:
Let yourself go free â€”
Be loved, be lived, believeâ€™
43.
In the midst of a winter forest
Pine, evergreen, in the mistâ€¦
â€” among the slow drips of after-rain â€”
Is a tree, a small well wire-guarded tree
In full soft pink-and-white twilight blossom:
And this is His gift.
Come, I will show you.
I have seen it.
(the morning after)
Was it the dew?
Or were they spider's web-threads?
I cannot tell â€”
But there, out of the window, among the trees
In the blue light of the morning, unseen
At first, and then winking â€”
Was one gold star, and then another
Gold-green, and one yellow tinged with fire
And then red, blue-white, white silver
Flashing like tiny lights
Brightening and multiplying
Until everywhere among the branches
There they were, in every colour
Under the clear new morning sky â€”
Among the birdsong
Star for star and note for note
The brown wings of a thrush startled up through
Without a sound â€”
And the Child is born.
Star of your heart â€”
He is born.
House of Bethany
envoi
Mist, you woodpigeon â€”
Calling me home, home through the fog.
