Singh steps out for peace in Sikh heartland.
By Derek Brown in New Delhi
THE new Indian Prime Minister, Mr Vishwanath Pratap Singh, travelled to the heart of battle-scarred Punjab yesterday to score an emotional public-relations victory.
Huge crowds turned out to cheer as the Prime Minister, spurning elaborate security precautions, rode through the city of Amritsar to the holiest shrine of the Sikhs, the Golden Temple.
He told the throng: ‘The people of Punjab have given me a lot of love…
I will now move in an open jeep instead of a bullet-proof car.’
At the temple, Mr Singh prayed alongside his deputy, Mr Devi Lal, and his Punjabi foreign minister, Mr Inder Kumar Gujral.
Masses of Sikhs jostled and crowded round him as he made his parikrama, the ritual clockwise walk around the marble margins of the sacred lake.
This was the gesture which leading Sikhs had pleaded in vain for the previous Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, to make.
And although there is as yet no solid evidence that a political settlement of the Sikh question is in sight, the change of government has brought a new spirit of reconciliation on both sides.
Mr Singh pledged yesterday that his administration would ‘move very fast’ to bring peace to Punjab.
He had come to pray, he said, not to make a political or official visit.
‘With the love and co-operation of Punjabis and the strength of God, I am confident that peace will once again return to the state,’ he said.
For most of the Eighties, Punjab has been wracked by vicious conflict between the security forces and half a dozen incoherent but well-armed groups ostensibly fighting for a free Sikh state of Khalistan, the Land of the Pure.
The violence was dramatically stepped up after the storming of the Golden Temple in mid-1984 by the Indian army.
For the past few years, the death count has been running at roughly 10 a day, with blood feuds and general gangsterism adding to the mayhem.
The previous Congress Party government tried to lay part of the blame on Pakistan, saying that Khalistan terrorists had been trained and armed across the frontier.
Most observers, however, believe the problem started with cynical Congress intrigues to split the main Sikh Party, the Akali Dal.
The manoeuvre succeeded, though at a dreadful cost.
There are now at least half a dozen Akali factions, both moderate and militant.
The former tried to reach an accord with New Delhi, but their state government was replaced by direct rule following the assassination of the Akali leader, Mr Harchand Singh Longowal.
The strongest Akali faction by far is now that led by Mr Simranjit Singh Mann.
He and his followers won 10 of the state's 13 parliamentary seats in last month's general election, with Mr Mann himself scoring a dramatic victory from his prison cell.
On the day his result was announced, he was released after five years of detention without trial, still defiantly declaring his faith in the Sikh cause.
But in the short and euphoric interval, even Mr Mann has softened his approach, indicating that he was now prepared to accept the constitution of India, and distancing himself from the latest demands by the ultra-belligerent Sikh student movement for an alternative government.
In the wake of the Mann group's victory, and the strident noises from the Student Federation, some reports from Amritsar had spoken of a return of terrorism to the temple itself, scene of bloody battles in 1984 and again last summer.
One of the direst warnings, pleading for immediate though unspecified action, came from the state Governor, Mr S.S. Ray.
But already, as a staunch Congressman, he knew his time was up.
Yesterday he resigned and was replaced by Mr Nirmal Kumar Mukarji.
Mr Ray's last warning was both unheeded and unnecessary.
As Mr V.P. Singh paid his humble respects at the seat of Sikh pride and piety, the militants' guns and the swords were put away.
The police security guards too were discreet, and allowed the people of Punjab, both Sikh and Hindu, to surge round their Prime Minister.
Berlin army joins people's cause.
By Anna Tomforde in East Berlin
IN the more radical mood that has now gripped East Germany's revolution, the question of where the army would stand in the event of conflict has emerged as a key issue.
As citizens continue to storm offices of the secret police, stern warnings have come from the government and the army that the line would be drawn at any attempts to enter barracks.
Clearly, behind the appeals for calm has been the fear that the army is now threatened by disintegration, something that has become evident in increasingly frank discussions.
It is not only the soldiers who express in East German television programmes their outrage at the revelations of corruption of former political leaders.
Officers have said they tolerated the old conditions for too long.
A staff meeting in East Berlin's Defence Ministry, attended by the Defence Minister, Admiral Theodor Hoffmann, heard Captain Uwe-Jens Karl say that the political scandals had ‘also discredited the whole army’.
He read out a statement saying: ‘We and our families are no longer prepared to make sacrifices for those who have brought the army into disrepute.
‘A renewed National People's Army needs the public and all social forces, it needs the people.
We want finally to be a people's army.’
East German television was this week allowed into the barracks of a crack guards regiment at Karlshorst.
‘If you hadn't come to us, we would have come to you,’ the colonel receiving the journalists said.
After the television crews were greeted with frantic applause from soldiers and officers of the Feliks Dzherzhinsky Regiment, privates spoke freely of the conflict they had reconciling their duty of protecting top leaders and central committee members with ever increasing revelations of corruption.
The senior officer said: ‘Even as a colonel I feel as cheated and betrayed as you do.’
Jews split over women's group.
By Mark Tran in Washington
ADECISION by B'nai B'rith International to expel its women's affiliate threatens to tear apart the world's largest Jewish organisation.
The simmering dispute erupted in public when the B'nai B'rith International board of governors adopted a motion to expel the 120,000-member B'nai B'rith Women unless the affiliate relinquishes its autonomous status.
B'nai B'rith Women, legally incorporated as a separate entity in 1962, also faces legal action challenging its right to use the B'nai B'rith name.
‘B'nai B'rith International's decision-makers now seek total control over their empire.
They will brook no independence,’ said the president of B'nai B'rith Women, Hyla Lipsky.
Expulsion of the women's group would mean a significant drop in the total membership of 500,000 at a time when numbers joining are declining.
The president of B'nai B'rith International, Mr Seymour Reich, said the organisation made the expulsion threat reluctantly and after several years of negotiation.
He believes that B'nai B'rith Women's determination to remain autonomous works against the trend of creating a new organisation for the 21st century comprising men and women.
He sees the decision to fully integrate the women's arm into the organisation as a way of boosting membership.
‘It's ironic,’ said Mr Reich.
‘Here we are offering them full equality with men in B'nai B'rith, and their leadership is rejecting that offer.’
Although not a political organisation, B'nai B'rith Women has taken high-profile stands on contentious political issues.
The organisation, against the wishes of B'nai B'rith International, took a public stand against the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court because of his anti-abortion stance.
Poland sees Council as first step to membership.
By AP in Brussels
THE chairman of Poland's foreign affairs committee said yesterday his country would request membership of the European Community and all other European institutions.
‘Yes, Poland is seeking a place in all European institutions,’ Mr Bronislaw Geremek said after meeting with the presidents of the Commission.
Mr Geremek said as a first step Poland would soon seek full membership in the Council of Europe.
In November, Hungary became the first East European nation to apply for membership to the council based in Strasbourg, France.
A condition for membership of the EC is that the country must be a full parliamentary democracy.
Mr Geremek said he had told EC officialsthat ‘the process of democratisation in Poland is irreversible’.

Mass murder was ‘revenge on feminists’.
By Penny MacRae in Montreal
POLICE say a young loner who claimed feminists had ruined his life was responsible for a bloody shooting spree at a Montreal university in which 14 women were killed.
Thirteen others — nine men and four women — were wounded in the rampage on Wednesday that shattered the festive end-of-term mood at the French language Universite de Montreal, Quebec's largest.
Details began to emerge yesterday of the gruesome attack — the biggest mass murder in Canadian history.
Police said the gunman, in his early 20s and identified only as Marc, carried a hit list with the names of 15 women in a letter found on his body.
The gunman shouted ‘I want the women’ as he roamed the engineering buildings at the university, spraying bullets before turning his semi-automatic rifle on himself.
The dead, 13 of them students, were on three different floors of the building.
In one classroom, the gunman divided the students by sex to separate sides of the room and then started shooting the women.
‘He told them, ‘You're women, you're going to be engineers.
You're all a bunch of feminists, I feminists’,’ said one student, Robert Leclerc.
‘My friend Natalie replied, ‘No, it's not true, we're not feminists,’ but the gunman fired into the group.’
Police said the three-page letter found in the killer's back pocket blamed women for the disappointments in his life.
‘All the words he uses are what you would call anti-feminist,’ said a police officer.
The letter indicated the killer had been rejected by the Canadian armed forces for being anti-social, police said.
Distraught parents kept an all-night vigil at the university where a temporary morgue was set up.
One police officer arrived at the scene to find his daughter dead on the floor.
‘It was just like Rambo,’ said one of the scores of horrified students who fled from the university after the massacre.
The Quebec premier, Mr Robert Bourassa, condemned the killings as a ‘barbaric carnage’ and declared three days of official mourning.
Food pledge for Ethiopia.
By Reuter in Brussels
THE Community yesterday promised 44,000 tonnes of new food aid for Ethiopia in an effort to save millions of people threatened by starvation.
The pledge brings total EC food aid to Ethiopia to 175,000 tonnes, after a 30,000-tonne gift of cereals in November, officials said.
Under a special programme, aid worth about 10 million ECUs (£8 million) would also go on transport and other urgent supplies.
Ethiopia has asked for 377,000 tonnes of food to fend off famine in Eritrea and Tigre.
United Nations experts say as many as four million people are facing famine after a severe drought and crop failure.

Mojahedin ‘plot against republics’.
By John Rettie in Moscow
AFGHAN guerrillas have been infiltrating Soviet Central Asia with ‘narcotics, arms and other instruments of subversion’ in an attempt to overthrow Soviet rule and set up Islamic governments, according to the KGB chief in the Soviet republic of Tadjikistan.
It has long been a nightmare in Moscow that the region could be highly vulnerable to Islamic militants from the indigenous population's ethnic and religious brothers across the borders in Afghanistan and Iran.
These fears have grown apace since the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan gave rise to bitter hostility towards the Russians among many Afghans.
Under Mr Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika, Central Asians have also begun to express their resentment at what they see as Russian exploitation of their land during the Stalin and Brezhnev eras.
Now, in the first detailed account of what were apparently serious efforts by the Mojahedin to subvert Soviet power, Tass has quoted Mr Vladimir Petkel, the head of state security in Tadjikistan, as saying the situation had become considerably worse since the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
‘Over the past few months, state security organs and border guards exposed and suppressed several attempts by special agencies of Afghan armed opposition forces to recruit Soviet citizens,’ he said.
They were to be induced to carry out ‘hostile activities on Soviet territory with the help of foreigners penetrating into Tadjikistan across the border’.
A number of Afghan agents, as well as some of their Soviet contacts, were caught, according to Mr Petkel.
One, named as ‘Engineer Bashir’, was described as ‘a field commander, head of an intelligence centre and deputy leader of the Islamic Party of Afghanistan’.
Bashir and an assistant named Mirahmad were said to have recruited Afghans from the border provinces of Badakshan and Kunduz who ‘underwent a special training course in the armed opposition camps’.
These agents ‘were to induce Soviet citizens to collaborate in the delivery of narcotics, arms and other instruments of subversion into Soviet territory.
Their final goal was to create bases in the Tadjik Republic from which to destabilise the situation in Soviet Central Asia, and to mobilise forces aiming to overthrow the system existing in the Soviet Central Asian Republics’.
An arms cache was found in the house of ‘a certain Azimov’ who was alleged to have been recruited by Bashir's agents.
Tass said journalists were shown money and hand grenades seized from him and a tape recorder ‘with the text of the oath Soviet citizens were expected to take when recruited’.
Two Afghans, among several arrested trying to cross the border, ‘admitted that they belonged to an intelligence group entrusted with the organisation of an underground anti-Soviet movement in Tadjikistan, whose purpose was to turn the republic into an Islamic state’.
A number of people had been put on trial, Mr Petkel said.
But the Tass report had a happy ending — from the Soviet point of view.
‘Two criminal cases, involving one Soviet and one Afghan citizen who openly confessed and repented their actions against the Soviet Union, have been discontinued.’
Trade accord sought in Gulf.
By Reuter in Nicosia
COMMISSIONER Abel Matutes, visiting Gulf Cooperation Council states, said yesterday that the EC and GCC were discussing the possibility of a trade agreement as a step toward free trade.
The EC runs a $4.4 billion trade surplus with the GCC, an economic alliance linking Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
Most EC goods enter almost duty-free.
Members are pressing for freer European access for the products of their petrochemical industries.
Mr Matutes, who is EC commissioner for Mediterranean policy and Latin American relations, arrived in Muscat from Saudi Arabia.

Pretoria to halve military service.
By David Beresford in Johannesburg
SOUTH Africa is to cut national service for young whites by half, as part of a reduction in the country's reliance on the military establishment.
The State President, Mr F.W. de Klerk, announced yesterday that conscripts would do only one year full-time military service, instead of two.
Speaking at the opening of a new headquarters for the state arms-manufacturing corporation, Armscor, he said other cuts in the military establishment would be disclosed next year.
The announcement follows the dismantling of the National Security Management system — the ‘shadow’ system of government by security chiefs — and ties in with plans to reduce the military budget by about 15 per cent, or £375 million.
The moves will be seen as further evidence of Mr De Klerk's commitment to a political, rather than a military, solution to the country's long-running crisis.
The latest decision will immediately affect about 35,000 young white men due to begin service next February and more than 15,000 scheduled to start in August.
Other race groups are not required to do national service.
The news was welcomed yesterday by the End Conscription Campaign, which has been running an increasingly effective protest against national service on the grounds that servicemen are used to oppress the country's majority population.
Recently 771 conscripts publicly announced their refusal to do military service as part of a national defiance campaign by the anti-apartheid community.
Several young whites are already serving terms of imprisonment for refusing to serve.
The Afrikaans weekly newspaper, Vrye Weekblad, has named a South African conscript who, it says, was required to do his military service as a spy.
A report in today's edition says that the youth, aged 19, was sent to the Netherlands by Military Intelligence to infiltrate an anti-apartheid group, the Committee of War Resisters.
Aquino tries to rally loyal Filipinos.
By Sheila Coronel in Manila
THE Philippine President, Mrs Corazon Aquino, lashed out at her enemies and mobilised popular support behind her beleaguered government yesterday at a rally attended by thousands of Filipinos.
‘These people want to show how brave they are.
Just because I am a woman they belittle me,’ she said to loud cheers.
The rally was held as the government managed to contain a week-long military rebellion that came dangerously close to succeeding.
Mrs Aquino spoke at the highway intersection where thousands of people defied President Ferdinand Marcos's tanks and troops nearly four years ago.
Yesterday's event was intended to be a re-creation of the ‘people power’ uprising that swept Mrs Aquino to office.
This celebration of the triumph of democracy coincided with a congressional debate on the curbing of civil liberties under the state of emergency declared on Thursday.
With the emergency, Mrs Aquino hopes to address some of the social and economic grievances of her people by controlling prices, improving public services, and cushioning the effects of sagging confidence among investors.
The measures may include restrictions on political rights to control the dissent that has thrived in the Philippine's democracy, sometimes to the point of anarchy.
Mrs Aquino now has to decide whether she should be magnanimous in victory or punish those behind the mutiny.
She is damned if she does and damned if she doesn't.
If she decides to forgive and forget, as she did after previous takeover attempts, she might not be able to rein in the military.
On the other hand, cracking down on the rebels could widen the fissures within the army and encourage disgruntled officers to plot more coups.
Yesterday, Mrs Aquino aimed her sharpest barbs at her civilian enemies.
She did not even mention the military involvement in the rebellion or the officer widely believed to have led it, the cashiered Colonel Gregorio Honasan.
In the past, Mrs Aquino has taken a conciliatory stance towards ambitious factions in her armed forces, but, instead of appeasing mutineers, this policy has stoked rebellion in the barracks.
Under the Marcos dictatorship, the army was allowed to exercise vast powers.
With the restoration of democracy in 1986, the monster that Marcos had unleashed refused to be caged.
Even now, although the latest rebellion has been contained, military leaders say another coup attempt is possible.
Military officers have tried to seize power six times since Mrs Aquino became President three years ago.
The latest attempt is timed with growing popular dissaffection with the government's inability to provide basic services and curb corruption and rising prices.
Worrying for the government, however, is that the troops who launched the rebellion last week were the cream of the Philippine military.
These elite forces are the best equipped and trained and the most disciplined in a 150,000-strong army famous for its incompetence.
Even if it failed, the attempted takeover was remarkably well planned and executed.
Although Mrs Aquino survived, she is now even more beholden to the military faction, led by the Defence Secretary and former Chief of Staff, Mr Fidel Ramos, that defended her government.
The problem is Mr Ramos has become a focus of discontent among younger officers who see the retired general as politically ambitious and militarily incompetent.
To defuse future rebellions, reshuffling the top brass may be necessary.
‘But how can President Aquino overhaul the leadership of the armed forces after she has already commended them for putting down the coup?’ asks a congressman and former military officer, Mr Bonifacio Gillego.
In the aftermath of every previous coup attempt, Mrs Aquino gave the army more concessions, including a reprieve on investigations into their abuses of human rights, a tougher anti-Communist policy, a purge of left-leaning cabinet secretaries and higher pay.
This time she asked Congress to approve a 100 per cent increase in soldiers' daily allowance.
And it is expected that in the next few days she will address the military's other grievances.
Smarting from the coup attempt, in which her official residence was bombed from the air and the capital's financial heart seized for five days, Mrs Aquino came swinging back yesterday.
‘Maybe it is time for me to get angry and fight back at those who are fighting me,’ she said.
The crowd roared as Mrs Aquino said her former Defence Secretary, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, should be investigated for complicity in the coup attempt.
Mrs Aquino also hinted that her Vice-President, Mr Salvador Laurel, and her first cousin and a Marcos associate, Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, were involved in the plot.
She added: ‘Our next election is not until 1992.
Those who want to be president will have to wait until then.’
Nicaraguans see red over economic ruin Grinding poverty, not revolutionary zeal, is the real election issue, Simon Tisdall writes from Masaya.
NICARAGUA suffered an attack of ‘Red Dizziness’ this week — in the Spanish, Marea Roja, a bug caught from eating tainted sea food.
But in a week that marked the opening of the campaign for February's elections, the red dizziness was not confined to restaurants.
In Masaya, a dusty, impoverished town to the south-west of Managua, supporters of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) turned an election rally into a raucous, joyful rampage on Wednesday night.
With the blue and white Nicaraguan flag fluttering amid the Sandinistas' red and black banners, a jeep-borne President Daniel Ortega led an anarchic procession to the accompaniment of bands, singers, dancers, and the alarmed squeals of a tethered pig.
The message for the Nicaraguan opposition was simple: On February 25 ‘we will bury you!’
The revolution which triumphed in 1979 would triumph again.
A second revolution may well be on the way in Nicaragua, but one not to the liking of the FSLN.
President Ortega faces the most potent challenge to his leadership since the Sandinistas took full control in 1981.
The challenge comes not from the US, not from the contra rebels, nor from hostile neighbouring countries, but from within.
In short, the government is being called to account for the economic disaster that is present-day Nicaragua.
As a Managua businessman put it, ‘I used to sell fridges.
Nobody bought them so I began to repair fridges.
But nobody has their fridges repaired any more, they can't afford it.
So all the fridges stay rusted, and I have no work.’
For many Nicaraguans, the deciding election issue will have little to do with the rhetoric of purist revolutionary solidarity.
They are no longer proud to be poor.
Official figures show that private consumption under Sandinista rule has fallen by 70 per cent.
Real wages have fallen by 90 per cent since 1981.
Unemployment is rising, with the industrial sector expected to contract by 20 per cent this year.
The flight from the countryside has compounded the misery of the urban poor, traditionally the bedrock of Sandinista support.
Government measures to peg back inflation have deepened the recession.
The Sandinista campaign slogan, ‘Everything will get better’, seems in this context an admission of defeat.
Their platform emphasises their achievements in reducing child mortality and enhancing rural education, and seeks to present the FSLN as an experienced, united party.
The main opposition alliance, the 14-party Nicaraguan Opposition Union (UNO), is portrayed as opportunist and divided and infiltrated by pro-contra, Somoza-era hangovers.
But a series of opinion polls have suggested, very roughly, a 30-30 split with 40 per cent of the electorate undecided.
If the Sandinistas have their problems, so too does UNO.
Its presidential candidate, Mrs Violeta Chamorro, brings to the fray a symbolic appeal as the widow of the murdered publisher of La Prensa, but lacks any political experience — a fact that becomes embarrassingly clear when she appears in public.
UNO's acceptance of US campaign fund donations and Mrs Chamorro's appointment of the former contra director, Afredo Cesar, as her adviser, has opened her to charges of collaborating with the US.
The main theme of the UNO campaign is reconciliation.
The alliance plays on the prospect of an end to the US trade embargo and increased foreign aid in the event of an UNO victory.
It has pledged to end the deeply unpopular draft and to reduce the 80,000-strong army.
The US and the Soviet Union have publicly backed the electoral process, which was agreed last February.
Moscow continues as the main Sandinista financier, pumping in about $465 million in economic aid.
But given the democratic revolution on its own doorstep, the Soviet Union is now distanced from its long-time proteges.
For the US, the emphasis is on securing a free and fair election, which the State Department seems to believe will result in an opposition victory.
The US has alleged intimidation by turbas divinas — pro-Sandinista thugs and claims to have evidence of voter intimidation by the army.
Washington has also threatened not to recognise the poll result if Congressional observers are barred from joining those of the UN, the OAS, and the Jimmy Carter foundation.
It is unclear whether a democratically defeated FSLN would relinquish power.
After 10 tumultous years of substantial achievement and disastrous mistakes, the Sandinistas control the army, the unions, the youth movements, much of the media and the money — what there is of it.
Did Daniel Ortega struggle so hard and so long, suffer seven years in jail, and defy the mighty US at such cost to his country, only to drive his jeep into the sunset?
It is a dizzying thought.
European Community Hungary granted £800m loan deal.
By Reuter in Brussels
THE European Commission on Wednesday approved an EC loan of one billion Ecus (£800 million) to help Hungary overcome severe balance of payments problems, the first organised for a non-EC country.
EC Commissioner Henning Christophersen said the five-year loan was highly exceptional, ‘but then we're in a highly exceptional situation’.
It was conditional on Budapest agreeing a structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund and implementing market-based economic reforms.
It should also not take the place of fresh funds from Western banks, Mr Christophersen said.
‘The loan would be another concrete expression of the Community's support [for]Hungary's progress towards democracy and a market economy.’
Mr Christophersen urged EC governments and the European Parliament to give speedy approval to the loan, which will be paid in three instalments.
The operation to raise the money on international markets could start next February if there were no procedural difficulties, he added.
Because of the EC's standing in markets, the loan would be raised on the best possible terms, but it would not be a subsidised, ‘soft’ loan, Mr Christopherson emphasised.
The Community would monitor Hungary's programme to restructure its economy on more market-oriented lines, and disburse the second and third tranches of the money only if satisfied about progress.
The Community was working in close cooperation with the IMF, and the loan was intended to complement its efforts.

Thatcher outgunned on Treaty of Rome summit Community closes ranks against Britain.
By John Palmer in Strasbourg
THE other 11 heads of state and government of the European Community last night closed ranks in an impressive display of unity against the sole opposition of Mrs Thatcher, to hold a special conference next year to amend the Treaty of Rome and open the way to economic and monetary union.
The conference will be held as part of the European summit in Rome next December and the aim will be to agree far-reaching changes to the Community's constitution to achieve Economic Monetary Union (EMU) as soon as possible after 1992.
The united front put up by the other EC leaders was made possible by the West German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, who abandoned any attempt to slow down the decision on an inter-governmental conference.
He said that the Italian Government, which takes over the presidency of the EC Council of Ministers, in July should ‘convene and open’ the treaty revision conference before handing over its presidency in December next year.
The West German Chancellor also fell into line with his French allies by agreeing that the Community should try to be ready to implement the economic union when the single market came fully into operation on January 1, 1993.
Last week he had hinted that it might be better to get an agreement by the time of the next European Parliament elections in June 1994.
There was barely a chink of light between the 11 over the speed with which the European Community should move towards a semi-federal economic and monetary system.
Chancellor Kohl spoke in almost identical terms to President Franois Mitterrand and the others in arguing that ‘instability and uncertainty in the outside world’ made it imperative for the EC to accelerate economic integration.
For her part, Mrs Thatcher gave a relatively low key presentation of her alternative ‘evolutionary’ approach to economic and monetary union.
The Prime Minister emphasised that even she shared the goal of monetary union, eschewing on this occasion the expression ‘economic and monetary reform’ which she has preferred in the past.
‘We have been in favour of this objective since 1962,’ she said.
Mrs Thatcher told her fellow summiteers that, in the end, it might be quicker and more secure if they worked with market forces in moving towards monetary union.
The first phase of economic union would only begin next July.
Mrs Thatcher insisted it would make more sense to wait and see how it worked out in practice before preparing moves to the more controversial second and third stages of EMU — including a central bank and a single currency.
However, Mrs Thatcher did not go into any detail about how the suggested British scheme for allowing different currencies to compete freely throughout the Community would necessarily produce the kind of central bank and co-ordinated monetary and economic policies which the others believe is essential.
And she neither volunteered nor was asked for any new statement of intent about how soon the British would agree to sterling joining the fixed exchange rate regime of the European Monetary System.
Until almost the last moment there were lingering hopes in the British camp that the West German Chancellor might signal some differences with his French allies.
But having politely listened to Mrs Thatcher's remarks and having promised to pay due attention to Whitehall's alternative strategy, the summit made it clear that their strategy for monetary union would broadly follow the blueprint laid down.
It will fall to the Italian Presidency to get agreement on the precise terms of reference for the EMU conference.
One problem will undoubtedly be the growing demands of the European Parliament, backed by Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, to be given a bigger say with the Council of Ministers in setting broad Community economic objectives and in holding a future EC central bank to account.
The Danish Prime Minister, Mr Poul Schluter, insisted that the future union could not be restricted to purely monetary issues but would have to involve an increasing convergence of economic policies and objectives for growth, inflation, and employment.
Several prime ministers made it clear that they would want to see a radical extension of the Community powers and resources to help poorer regions and social groups as they moved to monetary union.
Shortly afterwards Mrs Thatcher found herself similarly isolated in a one to 11 minority when the other heads of government endorsed a Declaration of Social Rights.
Although Mrs Thatcher's opposition will prevent the declaration having any legal force, the Commission President, Mr Jacques Delors, made it clear he would be coming forward with detailed proposals on a range of minimum social rights for workers in the 1992 single market over the next 12 months — some of which would have binding legal force throughout the Community.

By Simon Tisdall in Tegucigalpa, Honduras
AT the store on the corner, three drunken men are trying to eat the same hot dog.
Across the road, an army conscript dressed in battle fatigues watches.
Somewhere along the dark street, somebody is crying.
It is past midnight in Tegucigalpa, and it's time to go home.
And here, at last, come the Kids from Fame.
Chela and Urna are dancers at La Fama night club, a grotty little joint comprising one bar, 15 or so rickety wooden tables, and an illuminated picture of a woman's bottom.
But La Fama has a stage.
And that is what really interests Chela and Urna.
Like thousands of young people who crowd the narrow streets of Tegucigalpa, the Kids from La Fama are obsessed with the trappings of North American culture.
A fancy New York dance school it isn't, but for Chela and Urna the spotlit stage at La Fama is an alluring link with the much-emulated, much vilified empire to the north.
Such schizophrenia, when it comes to the ‘yanquis’ is common throughout Central America.
Through the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the US is attempting to encourage export industries in countries such as Honduras, in addition to direct financial aid.
But this reopens the issue of national dependence on Uncle Sam.
And the particulars of such a seeming unequal struggle are of little immediate help to the Kids from La Fama.
Since dancing cannot earn them a living, Chela and Urna are into self-help, and it is as humiliating in personal terms as any perceived national, cultural subservience to the US.
When they suggest a dance to my companion, Wesley, there seems no harm — but it turns into a smooch.
Solos become doubles, and doubles trebles.
And the Kids from La Fama grow ever more possessive.
‘Now we have to go,’ say Chela and Urna suddenly.
‘But there is a problem.’
The problem turns out to be the boss of the club, who says we must pay $8 if the girls are to leave.
Outside, I wait for Wesley, who is negotiating Chela and Urna's release.
Finally, here they come, the Kids from Fame, Honduras-style, giggling yet purposeful.
‘Where do you want to go, we'll drop you in a taxi,’ I say.
All three now look at me incredulously.
And the penny drops.
‘Back to the hotel, man, come on!’ says Wesley.

Bidding for red star.
Eighteen companies are bidding for the contract to remove the red star from the dome of Hungary's Parliament, writes Michael Simmons.
The government has decreed that, from the end of this month, only the national colours and the coat of arms of the new republic can can be displayed.
Officials say removing the star will not be easy.
Warning on free market.
By Reuter in Brussels
THE 12 Community governments have speeded up implementation of rules to create their barrier-free market but are still far behind schedule, the Commission said yesterday.
The single market programme requires each member state to turn 279 rules and regulations into national law.
More than half have been approved by ministers already.
But in a report for EC leaders at Friday's summit in Strasbourg, the commission said only 14 of 86 measures that should have come into force by mid-November had been fully implemented by all 12.
That, however, was an improvement compared with the seven out of 68 in mid-August.

Britain makes slow progress in talks on Hong Kong.
By Stephen Vines in Hong Kong
BRITISH hopes of returning to normalcy in negotiations with China over the future of Hong Kong appeared to have been thwarted yesterday as the 14th round of Sino-British talks ended with only limited signs of progress.
Mr Anthony Galsworthy, the leader of the British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) delegation, said that the four-day meeting ‘certainly marks a return to business, but not necessarily as normal’.
He added: ‘It is no secret that the atmosphere in the past few months has not been easy.
I would say that it is better in many respects than it was’.
While British officials were busy trying to put the best face on the evident lack of progress at the talks, the Chinese delegation was eager to emphasise the differences between the sides.
A senior Chinese official said that Beijing was still worried by British attempts to ‘internationalise’ the Hong Kong question.
He explained that this meant that Britain was raising the matter in international forums and placing unnecessary pressure on China.
The official also said that Britain had failed to account for its decision to move the colony's main naval base out of the centre of Hong Kong, a move which he believed would have serious repercussions for the stationing of the Chinese military in the territory after the 1997 transfer of power.
British officials said that no more than a quarter of the meeting had been taken up with the ‘general issues’ raised by the Chinese.
The bulk of the discussion focused on basic issues.
It seems that China is still smarting over Britain's decision to suspend the work of the JLG in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Last September's JLG meeting in London ended with acrimony on both sides.
This meeting has at least concluded with a semblance of good will.
Pretoria refuses demands for judicial inquiry into assassination squads De Klerk reformist image suffers as cover-up feared.
By David Beresford in Johannesburg
SOUTH Africa's State President, Mr FW de Klerk, yesterday suffered the first serious blow to his reputation as the great reformer by appearing to acquiesce in a cover-up of political murders carried out by state agencies, including the police.
Opposition parties reacted indignantly to Mr De Klerk's overnight announcement that he would not set up a judicial inquiry.
The Democratic Party repeated its demand for an inquiry, saying it was necessary to establish whether cabinet ministers and the former President, Mr PW Botha, were privy to the murders.
The South African Council of Churches said ‘it is clear the issue of the death squads is going to be covered up’, and described Mr De Klerk's rationale for refusing a commission as ‘cynical and spurious’.
Mr De Klerk justified his decision on the curious grounds that an inquiry would take too long and would create ‘a climate of suspicion and distrust’ which ‘the country can ill afford at this stage in its history’.
The ‘tried and respected prosecution mechanisms of the state’ would instead be followed.
Mr De Klerk's announcement was accompanied by a statement from his Justice Minister that prosecutions would immediately be launched — against the two men responsible for disclosing the fact that the police have been carrying out officially sanctioned murders.
The minister, Mr Kobie Coetsee, said that a prosecution would be brought against the former security branch policeman on death row, Almond Nofomela, for the police murder of the civil rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge.
It was Nofomela who broke the scandal by confessing to his part in the Mxenge killing, 24 hours before he was due to hang for an unrelated murder of a white farmer.
Mr Coetsee said a warrant would also be issued for the arrest of Captain Dirk Coetzee, the former head of a police murder squad who confirmed and amplified Nofomela's disclosures, claiming that the killings had been approved at the highest level.
The government will seek to extradite him if he was outside the country, Mr Coetsee said.
The SACC characterisation of Mr De Klerk's statement, as ‘cynical and spurious’, is likely to be regarded as something of an understatement in many legal and political circles.
With strong evidence that the disclosures to date represent only the tip of the iceberg, the State President's claim that a commission of inquiry would create a climate of distrust verges on self-parody.
There is no known reason why a commission should not sit in parallel with criminal proceedings.
There have been past instances where commissions have issued interim reports recommending immediate criminal proceedings, while continuing their work.
Many will see Mr De Klerk's decision as a back-handed tribute to the independence of the judiciary.
It will be widely assumed that the cabinet fears it would be unable to control a judicial inquiry.
In the last government scandal — the Muldergate affair in the late 70s — Mr Botha, was forced to fire a judicial inquiry because the judge refused to cover up corruption.
Husak symbolises 21 lost years The Czechoslovak President has become one of Europe's old men with nowhere left to go.
Michael Simmons examines his career.
POLITICAL demonstrators in Czechoslovakia's streets have not hesitated to shout their views of President Gustav Husak.
He has become one of the most ridiculed members of the leadership.
A student with a punk haircut and a goose (husa in Czech) strapped into his rucksack was greeted with applause all round as he insolently walked the length of Wenceslas Square.
The crowds have not spat out his name with quite the virulence they showed for Mr Milos Jakes and Mr Miroslav Stepan, the Prague party supremo, in their last days, but there has always been an underlying, almost universal contempt.
He has become an expendable symbol of the 21 years lost by Czechoslovaks since the invasion of August 1968, for he had taken over, apparently without compunction, from Mr Alexander Dubcek as Communist Party leader when the latter was humiliated at the beginning of 1969.
Replacing the highly popular Mr Dubcek was no easy task, but on the grounds that Janos Kadar salvaged something in Hungary when he took over after the popular uprising of 1956, Mr Husak might have achieved something.
In fact, he achieved nothing.
For Mr Husak, this is something of a personal tragedy.
Like Erich Honecker, a man of similar vintage in East Germany, he spent his formative political years fighting for Communism against the Nazis.
At the end of the second world war he was one of a small band which went to Moscow to negotiate with Stalin an agreed programme for ‘liberated’ Czechoslovakia.
Soon after the Communist takeover, he fell foul of the ultra-Stalinists and, as a Slovak, was sentenced to life imprisonment for ‘bourgeois nationalism’.
He was released in 1960 and rehabilitated three years later.
After working, and studying law, for some years as a rank-and-file party member, he was appointed — at the height of the Prague Spring — deputy federal prime minister.
He became a member of the emasculated politburo when the invasion took place taking over from the wretched Mr Dubcek in April 1969 after branding him and his team ‘extremists and rightwing forces.’
He was one of the first in the battered political hierarchy to head for Moscow voluntarily for negotiations with Brezhnev.
From that moment on, the Kremlin saw him as a ‘realistic’ politician — in other words, as one who urged the people to accept the invasion.
On the first anniversary of that invasion, when thousands of Czechoslovak demonstrators were dispersed on Mr Husak's orders by the police with military support, he was awarded the Order of Lenin, the highest honour the Russians could give him, and his acceptance of it sealed his fate once and for all Within two years of becoming party leader he purged all but 26 of the central committee members who had been in office before the invasion.
When President Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in Moscow in early 1985, Mr Husak became one of the disoriented old men of Eastern Europe, and when Mr Gorbachev reached Prague, in the spring of 1987, Mr Husak looked out of his depth.
The writing on the wall for Mr Husak became apparent in the adulation which ordinary Czechoslovak citizens showed for Mr Gorbachev, and in the pages of the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, Pravda, where a series of articles harshly critical of Mr Husak's patron, Leonid Brezhnev, began to appear.
Having watched the ignominious departure of Mr Jakes, the president himself — which Mr Husak had become — can hardly have been surprised that his own head was now being demanded on a platter.
There were rumours after he had a stroke last March that he was on the brink of retirement and that he wished to go.
Nothing that has happened in Czechoslovakia or in the wider world since that time has diminished the willingness of the Czechoslovak people to accede to this wish.
Territory for peace no longer an impossible dream on eve of anniversary Intifada forces sea change among reluctant Israelis.
By Ian Black in Jerusalem
YITZHAK Rabin was looking even more than usually impassive on Wednesday night as he watched Israel Television's special programme marking the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising.
The Defence Minister barely flinched as the camera zoomed in for a close-up of his face as they ran the famous film clip from mid-December, 1987, in which he promised that it would all be over by Christmas.
No one could have predicted then that the unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would still be going on two years later, so Mr Rabin was playing fairly safe when he said in a brief interview at the end of Wednesday's programme that the uprising would probably continue well into 1990.
Israel can cope.
The mass demonstrations of the first year are rare these days and the army and Shin Bet security service have been chalking up success after bloody success in hunting down the masked youths who throw petrol bombs and kill collaborators.
Many soldiers would prefer to be fighting a ‘real’ war against armed guerrillas in south Lebanon, but no more than 95 men, mostly reservists, have refused to serve beyond the pre-1967 green line.
Intifada draft-dodging barely exists.
So far, the military situation is tenable: the army shifts its men around, from the Lebanon border, to training exercises, to the West Bank and Gaza, and then back to Lebanon again.
The general staff is unhappy and the squaddies disgruntled, but no more than that.
The economy can stand the strain too: a 5 per cent drop in the GNP this year is deemed manageable.
Palestinians still come to work in Israel, industry has adjusted and tourism shows signs of recovering.
The legal system, many feel, is being eroded.
Fifty thousand Palestinians have been through the prisons since the intifada began; scores of Arab children have been shot dead.
But rough justice on one side of the green line does not necessarily mean rough justice on the other.
Not yet, anyway.
Subtly, though, in other, more subterranean ways, the uprising has changed — and is still changing — Israeli society.
Arabs are no longer seen as cowardly and loathsome terrorists; their determination and solidarity has impressed their enemies.
Even the most hawkish Israeli cannot ignore the readiness for sacrifice that the Palestinans have displayed.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud Prime Minister, seems to recognise this too.
His refusal to deal with the PLO is practical, not emotional.
Palestinians can still seem demonic.
The cruel killings of real or imagined collaborators have helped restore this image, yet who has forgotten that Jews executed traitors during their own struggle for national liberation?
Mr Shamir's Stern Gang was no exception.
For the 20 years between the 1967 war and the start of the intifada there was coexistence of sorts between Arabs and Jews, even if, in the words of Moshe Dayan, it was the uneasy coexistence of a rider and his horse.
That no longer exists.
‘The achievement of the uprising,’ says the journalist Nahum Barnea, ‘is that the vast majority of Israelis who were happy with the status quo are now much more unhappy with it.’
This has created a new sense of potential fluidity in political attitudes.
Apart from the hard core of settlers and Greater Israel ideologues, many ordinary people have become more open to discussion of the future of the West Bank and Gaza.
Territory for peace is not an impossible dream.
But this does not preclude extreme and non-peaceful solutions.
Those who believe in the ‘transfer’ of Palestinians now believe in it more openly.
At the same time, though, there are more people who can, perhaps for the first time since 1967, imagine that the Jews could go west, back into the green line, or into new borders adjusted to rid themselves of their Palestinian burden.
It would be premature — and misleading — to try to translate these slowly shifting attitudes into a readiness for dramatic change.
All Israel's responses to the intifada have so far been dictated externally, by the Palestinians or the Americans.
There is still no substantial domestic pressure on Mr Shamir to make concessions.
The Labour Party is still a partner in the national unity government.
Anniversaries are arbitrary events, and nothing will change when the uprising's third year begins tomorrow.
Yet Wednesday's decision by Egypt — in close consultation with the PLO — to accept a US mediation plan means that an Israeli-Palestinian meeting is now likely in the New Year.
A long, hard struggle lies ahead to convert the achievements of the intifada into real movement towards a diplomatic settlement.
West Bank elections and an Israeli withdrawal still seem a remote possibility.
The uprising is certainly an historic event, but the conflict over Palestine has been going on for a century now.
A lot of international help will be needed to get things moving.
In a rapidly changing world, preoccupied by Eastern Europe, the American Administration may not have the time or patience to devote to Israelis and Palestinians.
The war may well just go on and on.
Both sides remain stubborn.
The Palestinians are tired but still defiant after their long struggle and most Israelis, like Mr Rabin, remain confident that they can cope, even if their doubts are beginning to nag.
It is a dangerous moment, pregnant with hope teetering on the edge of despair.
Intifada enters year three under curfew.
By Ian Black in Jerusalem
AS Israeli leaders met to discuss the latest Middle East peace moves, nearly a million Palestinians were placed under curfew in the occupied territories to forestall trouble during today's second anniversary of the intifada.
The country's senior politicians decided to send the Foreign Minister, Mr Moshe Arens, for talks in Washington next month with his American and Egyptian counterparts, drawing immediate criticism from rightwingers.
The decision follows Wednesday's conditional acceptance by Egypt of a US mediation plan to bring Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table in Cairo to discuss holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Likud Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, proposed holding the elections last May, but he is resolutely opposed to any role for Mr Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation, which he insists is still committed to terrorism.
Rightwingers in his own party, however, fear that by embarking on a dialogue under US auspices, Israel will eventually be pushed, despite its own reservations, into talks with the PLO and advance the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
One of the most truculent of his critics, the super-hawkish Mr Ariel Sharon, said yesterday that he would be consulting like-minded colleagues about what he called ‘the dangerous deterioration in the political situation’.
Considerable political turmoil can be expected until the Washington meeting takes place, and sources here predict that Mr Arens wil be taking a very hardline position that will preclude any participation by the PLO.
In advance of today's intifada anniversary, meanwhile, security measures were stepped up throughout the occupied territories, with curfews in force throughout the Gaza Strip and in large areas of the West Bank, including Nablus.
Friday prayers in the mosques of Jerusalem's Old City passed without incident, although large numbers of troops and paramilitary border police were on hand.
West Bankers and Gazans were unable to enter the city.
Israeli groups are planning protests over the weekend, with special attention focusing on a march in Jerusalem by the Peace Now movement in which demonstrators will carry pictures of some of the 130 Palestinian and four Jewish children under 16 who have been killed during the unrest.
All Israeli newspapers, which produce weekend editions on a Friday, yesterday carried long articles and in some cases special supplements marking the start of the uprising's third year.
Yediot Ahronot ran a piece by the novelist David Grossman, author of the acclaimed Yellow Wind, widely seen as the finest single literary work about the occupation when it was published in 1987.
His description of the intifada is entitled Land of the Masked Men.

Miami relaxes as policeman is found guilty of killing blacks.
By Martin Walker in Washington
THE tension that has gripped Miami began to ease yesterday as a policeman, William Lozano, was found guilty of manslaughter over the killing of two young black men on a motorcycle in January.
Three days of rioting by Miami's black community followed the killing, and police and city officials were on full alert yesterday for a resumption of the riots if the jury acquitted the Hispanic-American policeman.
All police leave and holidays were cancelled.
Two police armoured cars stood outside the courthouse.
The six-person jury unanimously found that Lozano had improperly used his gun.
Lozano had claimed that the motorcycle was aimed at him, and that he had no time to leap out of the way.
His shot killed the motorcyclist, and the passenger died of injuries after the bike crashed.
Lazano, who has been in the force five years, will be sentenced on January 24.
He faces a maximum term of 60 years.
Thatcher ‘risks blocking the spread of democracy’.
By Jean Stead in East Berlin
BRITAIN could lose a valuable opportunity to help the growth of democracy in Eastern Europe by failing to give total commitment to the European Community, the Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, said in East Berlin yesterday.
Mrs Thatcher risked impeding democratisation by not giving the Community total commitment, he said.
Mr Kinnock has ended two days of talks with opposition leaders in East Berlin, including New Forum and the East German Social Democrats.
He has also met Senate leaders in West Berlin.
He said he had heard calls for unity on every side, but for a unity of common interests, attitudes and culture shared by the two Germanys.
This was completely different from any idea of grandiose constitutional changes.
The opposition leaders he met agreed that the question of reunification of Germany was not one for the German people alone, but was the rightful concern of their European neighbours.
Some might see dangers and difficulties in discussing reunification, but it could not be left off the agenda.
Mr Kinnock said that the opening of the Berlin Wall made him ‘feel joyous about the future’.
He presented the mayor of West Berlin with a statuette of a woman holding a dove of peace and then walked through Checkpoint Charlie.
Sri Lanka finds cheer in Delhi's new government.
By Derek Brown in New Delhi
INDIA'S troubled relations with Sri Lanka have improved markedly since the change of government last weekend.
Mr Ranjan Wijeratne, the first foreign minister to visit Delhi since the general election, flies home to Colombo today with renewed assurances that India will withdraw its remaining ‘peace-keeping’ forces from the island, and work for closer co-operation.
There are 2 ½ divisions of Indian troops still in the north and east of Sri Lanka — up to 30,000 men — and little prospect of the withdrawal being completed by the original target date of December 31.
But after talks with the Prime Minister, Mr Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Mr Wijeratne ruled out any formal extension of the deadline.
‘The Prime Minister told me he would discuss the details with his officials and come back to us.
There is no new timetable,’ he said.
Was it realistic to hope that these thousands of 0troops, with their equipment, could be pulled out in just three weeks?
‘Where there is a will, there is a way.
I trust the leadership of India,’ Mr Wijeratne added.
The latest talks, which also involved the new Indian Foreign Minister, Mr Inder Kumar Gujral, also covered prospects for the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
The much-delayed Saarc summit has been provisionally arranged for early next March in Colombo.
Whether it is held, will depend on improvements in the dire security situation in Sri Lanka.
The Colombo government believes it has broken the back of the rebellion in the south by leftwing Sinhalese guerrillas, but is still faced with near anarchy in the Tamil north and east.
There, the provincial government installed as part of the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, is increasingly defiant of Colombo.
It has raised its own private army, which is already engaged in a two-front minor war with Sri Lankan government forces and with Tamil Tiger guerrillas, who, though badly mauled, have survived a bloody, two-year battle against vastly superior Indian forces, killing more than 1,150 of them.
Scots to mark Chariots of Fire runner's last resting place.
By Simon Winchester in Hong Kong
NEXT St Andrew's Day, if all goes to plan, a delegation of Scots, with a lone piper, will arrive at a forlorn old garden in the town of Weifang in eastern China, to bring to an appropriately dignified conclusion one of the more remarkable sports stories of the century.
The grave of the athlete Eric Liddell, the man who refused to run in the Olympics on the Sabbath in 1924 and whose story was immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire, has at last been found, unmarked.
A Hong Kong-based Scottish engineer and historian, Mr Charles Walker, is behind the scheme to inscribe a gravestone and place it at the spot where Liddell is known to have been buried.
The athlete, a devout Christian and, like his parents, a missionary in China, died in 1945, in a Japanese internment camp, in Shandong province.
A Hong Kong legislator interned with him, Mr H.K. Cheng, was able to help Mr Walker and a Canadian internee, Mr David Michell, to pinpoint the site, in the grounds of what is now Weifang Middle School.
Beijing is co-operating.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office sees the gesture as ‘one small but symbolic way of rebuilding some of the bridges destroyed after Tiananmen Square’, a diplomat said.
Mrs Jenny Somerville, Liddell's sister, has sent a verse from Isaiah to inscribe on the granite headstone: ‘They soar on wings like eagles; they run and grow not weary.’
Mr Walker is quietly optimistic.
‘If we can raise the money, and get the permissions, we will be there next St Andrew's Day.
It will be a sad little ceremony, but the right end, I think, for a much admired man.’
East Berlin pursues pillars of the old establishment.
By Anna Tomforde in East Berlin
IN East Germany two men, formerly regarded as untouchable pillars of the old regime, have, rightly or wrongly, become the focus of over-zealous and sometimes bizarre persecution by the legal authorities and an indignant public.
Mr Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the previous state secretary for foreign trade gave himself up early yesterday to the police in West Berlin, where he is now under arrest.
He is accused by East Berlin, which has asked for his extradition, of embezzlement, corruption, and illegal dealings in arms and foreign currency.
A glittering figure on the international financial circuit, he not only provided East Germany with much-needed foreign currency but also played a central part in all political and economic exchanges with West Germany over the past 30 years.
He has protested his innocence, saying that before fleeing East Germany last weekend he dissolved the GDR's hard-currency accounts in Switzerland and transferred the sum of Dm60 million (£22 million) to East Germany's state bank.
He said he had always worked for the benefit of his country and could not be held responsible for how the hard currency he procured was spent by its leaders.
Sources here said that if Mr Schalck-Golodkowski was put on trial his inside knowledge of life under Mr Erich Honecker could prove highly detrimental to the already disgraced former East German leaders.
But while Mr Schalck-Golodkowski's innocence or guilt must remain a matter for the courts, the detention of his friend and lawyer, Mr Wolfgang Vogel, clearly was in breach of the law.
It demonstrated the excesses that are possible in the present climate of confusion and for which the chief public prosecutor has apologised.
Mr Vogel, detained on Tuesday and held for 10 hours in a solitary cell, was arrested because the prosecutors believed he would reveal the whereabouts of Mr Schalck-Golodkowski.
For almost 30 years he was a key negotiator for East Berlin on ‘humanitarian questions’ and a confidante of Mr Honecker.
Spy swaps, prisoner exchanges, and negotiations to free the thousands of East Germans that this summer sought refuge in West German embassies, were his domain.
He said yesterday: ‘I was told that the buying-out of political prisoners by West Germany and the spy swaps were immoral and against the law.’
Summit offers chance to improve British image in EC Hurd faces test of beliefs on Europe.
By Michael White in Strasbourg and Hella Pick
THE Strasbourg summit, which begins this morning, will prove a critical test of the political skills of the new Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, six weeks after he inherited the post in which Mrs Thatcher has tormented and overruled his predecessors.
Mr Hurd, who dared to speak French on French Radio this week, is as instinctive a European as the Prime Minister is not.
But loyalty and prudence will require him to do good by stealth this weekend if he is to restore Britain's tarnished European image.
Apart from last month's Elysee supper-summit, this is his first outing with Mrs Thatcher.
Tensions over the degree of British commitment to eventually joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) during the Madrid summit in June contributed to Sir Geoffrey Howe's removal from the Foreign Office in July.
During Mr John Major's brief tenure he was made to look foolish on his one co-starring trip — the Commonwealth conference in Kuala Lumpur — by the Prime Minister's repudiation of the South African statement he had negotiated.
Unlike Mr Major, Mr Hurd is an experienced former diplomat and a Foreign Office Minister of State who has sounded made-for-the-job since day one, which is why he would probably not have got it but for the Lawson affair.
In what are often highly technical arguments where tone matters a lot, he sounds like a politician who would join the ERM as soon as practicable — possibly by the end of next year — just as Sir Geoffrey, Mr Heseltine and Mr Lawson would.
Mrs Thatcher does not sound that way.
Labour, which wants immediate negotiation on its own four-point terms of entry into ERM, now paints Mr Major as a Thatcher poodle on the issue.
That may be wrong.
And a Hurd-Major axis could prove crucial if the Prime Minister is to be dragged in when inflation, and the exchange rate, have drifted down far enough.
Meanwhile, Mr Hurd loyally reflects the cabinet line on Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) embodied in the treasury's ‘competing currencies’ paper issued on November 2 as an alternative to the Delors report's Stage II and III — the creation of a single central bank and currency.
Labour, too, rejects the independent central bank concept run by what Shadow Chancellor, Mr John Smith, has called ‘central bankers who inhabit a world comfortably insulated from European electorates’— in other words undemocratic and deflationary.
Mr Hurd has no trouble stressing the need for a liberalisation of European markets in which Britain has often led the way.
He protests that the French-backed Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to promote Delors II and III is premature when the consequences of Stage I — including next July's abolition of French and Italian exchange controls — are far from clear and the preparatory work not done.
He is less conspicuous in opposing the Social Charter as a costly threat to jobs if the standards of Germany are to be imposed on countries like Britain.
And, like Sir Geoffrey and Mr Heseltine, he routinely sets up federalism as a straw man to knock down.
But he does not use the harsh, emotive language of the Prime Minister.
In a speech in Oxford last weekend he stressed voluntary co-operation and diversity.
‘European union is not a goal or an event.
It is a process.
Against that background I do not believe that the path of federalism is the right one for the Community.’
Such use of the word ‘union’ is un-Thatcherite.
So Mr Hurd will use his diplomatic skills — and his French — in Strasbourg to keep the temperature down and take the rough edges off disagreement, while advancing with pragmatic caution greater British involvement in the rapidly evolving structure of the Community.
He does not favour its enlargement but does favour new forms of association for EFTA and the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
By contrast, Mr Major was a novice Foreign Secretary whose skills and stamina were tested to breaking point when — alone — he tried to modify the draft South African statement in Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Major won enough useful points in support of Britain's well-advertised aversion to punitive sanctions to have been able to brief Sunday papers about a ‘British victory’.
It is not clear whether he knew then that Mrs Thatcher had decided to sign the statement and then issue her own alternative.
Informed sources say that Mr Major was informed ‘rather late’ when much of the Thatcher outburst had already been drafted by Charles Powell, her private secretary, who had accompanied her to the weekend retreat of Lankawi.
When Mr Major gave an unhappy press conference late on the Sunday night, his permanent secretary, Sir Patrick Wright, and other FO officials sat at the back of the room, suggesting either moral reinforcement or a watchdog role.
Mr Hurd needs no minders, but the 60 Tory MPs who declined to support Mrs Thatcher for leader last week, plus MEPs, this week's Lords report and many industrialists will be looking to him for a more emollient performance in difficult circumstances.
He has at least one advantage over his three predecessors, including Mr Francis Pym.
As things stand he does look ‘unassailable’.
MEPs set out their agenda in European power game.
By Michael White in Strasbourg
THE European parliament yesterday signalled renewed determination to use the drive for economic integration to close the ‘democratic deficit’, producing a 10-point plan which, despite the suspicions of Conservative and Labour front benches, could have profound implications for Westminster.
Addressing the 12 heads of government at the start of the Strasbourg summit, Mr Enrique Baron, the Spanish Socialist who is Lord Henry Plumb's successor as president of the parliament, urged the leaders to go all the way towards full European union provided it is ‘based on the characteristics which we share in common— those of parliamentary democracy’.
His blueprint for evolving ‘a genuine parliamentary democracy’ will be discussed at a preparatory conference next spring which the European parliament will hold with the Council of Ministers and the bureaucratic Commission.
Its aim, with the likely support of West Germany and the Commission President, Mr Jacques Delors, will be to ensure that institutions of democratic accountability are developed in parallel with the supra-national instruments of economic and monetary policy-making like the proposed central bank.
The development would run in tandem with the inter-governmental conference.
MPs at Westminster are increasingly aware of the pervasive impact of Europe on their activities which barely see a week pass without some debate on EC directives.
There is no automatic membership of the relevant Commons committees — let alone votes — for MEPs as there is in Bonn and elsewhere.
The Commons scrutiny committee proposed better procedures last month for vetting, or resisting, the flow from Brussels and Mr Michael Heseltine has urged the creation of an upper house at Strasbourg — a European senate — drawn from among MPs in national parliaments to bridge the current gap.
Its powers are not clear, a reflection of the confusion which exists.
Mr Baron's 10 points yesterday were not fleshed out either, but they go further than MEPs have yet done.
They include a proposal that the European Parliament have the right to initiate legislation, albeit perhaps jointly with the Commission; and what is called ‘a joint decision-making by Parliament in any new areas introduced under the new treaties’.
That is a roundabout way of suggesting a form of political accountability to elected MEPs when the central bank starts evolving macro-economic policies for all 12.
There is also a suggestion that the Council of Ministers meet in public when it is acting as a legislative body, a suggestion which some parliamentarians first attribute to Mr Tony Benn in his days as Energy Secretary.
Like Mr Benn, Mrs Thatcher asserts national sovereignty and democratic accountability though in reality a determined prime minister with a pliant majority at Westminster has more unfettered power than in most Community countries.
Labour, which has swung round to supporting Europe, is worried by the unaccountability of a central bank despite last week's assurances from Mr Delors.
Mr Bryan Gould is generally rated less European than the Shadow Chancellor, Mr John Smith; and Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, has swung round from gut anti-Europeanism to a conviction that powerful central institutions are unavoidable — and Britain should play its full part.
Yesterday, Mr Baron said that strict justice demanded that ‘the European Parliament cannot go on being regarded as a marginal institution, able only to speak but not to take decisions’.
He stressed: ‘It is peoples who, by their demonstrations and actions, point the way forward for their governments.
Would it not have been a pipedream only six weeks ago to think that the Berlin Wall would be knocked down?’
Ortega hinges peace offer on disbanding of contras Simon Tisdall in Managua looks at prospects for a Nicaraguan proposal at the Central American presidents' summit this weekend.
THE Nicaraguan Government is expected to launch an all-out attempt to secure the demobilisation of the contra rebels when the Central American presidents gather at San Jose in Costa Rica tomorrow for a summit meeting crucial to the future of the peace process.
In return for‘visible progress’ towards disbanding the Honduran-based contras by the end of the year, the Sandinistas will offer to use their influence with the leftwing rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) to halt the fighting in El Salvador.
According to West European diplomats in Managua, President Daniel Ortega is running out of time in his attempts to present himself to the Nicaraguan electorate on February 25 as the ‘peace maker’ who ended the contra war.
To that end, the Sandinistas will drop their earlier insistence on a firm deadline of December 30 if a UN, or OAS-supervised demobilisation, is making discernible headway in disarming or relocating the rebels, the diplomats said.
Nicaraguan sources here say that the summit meeting is likely to witness an angry denunciation by the Salvadorean president, Mr Alfredo Cristiani, of the Sandinista arms supplies to the FMLN rebels, especially last month's alleged deliveries by aircraft of Sam-7 anti-aircraft missiles.
Mr Cristiani suspended ties between the two countries in the wake of the incident and threatened to boycott tomorrow's summit meeting unless it was moved away from its planned Managua venue.
According to the sources, Nicaragua will, as usual, deny the allegations but propose instead ‘realistic negotiation’ between the US-supported Salvadorean Government and the FMLN.
‘In the Nicaraguan view, a military solution in El Salvador is impossible,’ a western diplomat said.
‘Realistic’ seems to mean negotiation acceptable to the FMLN and to the Salvadorean army, which would have to participate to ensure that any subsequent deal should stick.’
An attempt by Mr Cristiani to put the Sandinistas in the dock at San Jose is likely to prompt Mr Ortega to raise the human-rights record of the Salvadorean Government, especially the murder on November 16 of six Jesuit priests, probably by a renegade army unit.
‘They [the Sandinistas]were very concerned after the Sam-7 aeroplane incident’, one analyst said.
‘They could see it was distracting attention from their own priorities over contra demobilisation.
Now they are much more relaxed and hope to turn it to their advantage while still denying involvement.’
By offering to use their influence with the FMLN, which maintains offices and a radio station in Nicaragua, the Sandinistas may also point to Mr Cristiani that a summit meeting which supported negotiations would strengthen his hand with his own, powerful army commanders.
‘It is a poker game’, one senior western diplomat commented.
‘But Ortega is cleverer than the other and he works harder.’
In his quest for a solution to the contra insurgency, Mr Ortega dramatised the situation at the end of October by cancelling a 19-month-old ceasefire and resuming offensive operations.
He concentrated the Sandinista troops along the Honduran frontier; offered to end arms imports until after the election; gave assurances of safe conduct to returning rebels; and then said he was ready to reinstate the ceasefire he had only just abrogated.
As the issue assumes greater urgency, the Sandinistas may be willing to undercut, or at least put on hold, the FMLN insurgency in El Salvador, sources here suggest.
The Nicaraguans will try to increase the involvement of third parties in the peace process when the two-day summit meeting convenes.
As well as UN and OAS units, the Sandinistas have proposed arbitration, within the peace process itself, by the foreign ministers of Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela.
That has been opposed by Mr Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, who will chair the summit meeting.
For Managua, the greater the involvement of Latin countries and independent agencies, the greater is the pressure on Washington to support contra demobilisation.
The five-country meeting at San Jose has assumed a critical atmosphere because of the possible breakdown of last August's Tela accord, which agreed contra demobilisation in exchange for democratic Nicaraguan elections.
Other accords under the peace process, chiefly the denial of support for regional insurgency, have also been threatened by recent events.
The impending retirement of Mr Arias, Nobel prize winner and the main motivator, has increased uncertainty.
Although the American Government supports the peace process, it has urged the contras to remain in Honduras until after the Nicaraguan election and has continued to provide them with non-military funds.
The contras, for their part, have consistently rejected calls to disband.
After the contra field commanders' rejection of their exiled political leaders, and as a result of Washington's loss of leverage, the estimated 12,000-strong force has become an even more unpredictable element in a complex equation.
For that reason alone, according to sources here, Mr Ortega's summit game plan could come to naught, leaving the Sandinistas to fight an election and a war, and the peace process close to collapse.
China slates reform wave.
By Stephen Vines in Hong Kong
THE Chinese Premier, Mr Li Peng, yesterday made what is believed to be his most forthright attack yet on the reforms sweeping Eastern Europe during a private meeting with a delegation from Hong Kong.
According to delegation sources, Mr Li said that Beijing was fortunate to have had the foresight to crack down on its democracy movement in June, preventing China from being thrown into the ‘turmoil and confusion’ now prevailing in Eastern Europe.
China has shown some restraint in commenting on events in Eastern Europe and has made its views evident only in oblique ways.
For example, the Chinese Communist Party pointedly sent a warm message of support to the conference of the hardline Romanian Communist Party.
However, events in Eastern Europe were evidently uppermost in Mr Li's mind during his meeting with the Hong Kong delegation which was in Beijing to discuss the future of the British colony.
Simon Long adds from Beijing: China seems to be retreating into a diplomatic posture reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, at odds with both Washington and Moscow, and firing frequent broadsides against all-comers for alleged interference in its internal affairs.
Yesterday, East Germany was in the firing line for having received the Dalai Lamai, exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, in East Berlin on Wednesday.
China also ‘could not tolerate’ the award given to the Dalai Lama in Paris, and ‘condemned’France for permitting the exiled democracy campaigner, Yan Jiaqi, to ‘conduct activities against the Chinese Government’.
China was similarly indignant about plans for the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama on Sunday, the anniversary of last year's demonstrations in Lhasa.
Star Watch A comet for Christmas:..
By Alan Pickup
THE newly-found Aarseth-Brewington comet should brighten rapidly this month as it sweeps southwards through Ophiuchus in our morning sky, perhaps to become a naked eye object before it dips too far south to be seen from Britain.
Its path is plotted on our star map, with its position marked every fifth morning.
The stars near the middle of the map rise in the east at 05.00 tomorrow and at 04.00 on Christmas Day, climbing to reach the places shown above the ESE to SE horizon at daybreak tomorrow and by 07.00 on Christmas Day.
Most of the brighter stars plotted are of the second magnitude, while the fainter ones are of the fourth.
The comet was close to the ninth magnitude on November 16 when it was discovered by amateur astronomers in Norway and the United States.
As it moves towards Perihelion on December 27, 45m km from the Sun and 140m from the Earth, it is doubling in brightness every four days or so.
The path is definite, but predictions of its brightness and appearance are very uncertain, although it is likely to develop an upwards pointing tail.
It may reach the sixth magnitude by December 10 and the fourth on about December 20 when it moves inside Mercury's orbit and passes the star Zeta Ophiuchi.
It may be brighter than the third magnitude by Christmas morning, but by then it will be low and difficult in the SE twilight.
Egypt accepts US talks plan.
By Deborah Pugh in Cairo
AFTER two months of agonising diplomatic wrangling, Egypt, with the apparent tacit agreement of the PLO, has agreed to the five-point formula of the US Secretary of State, Mr James Baker, for talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
The next step will be a round of preliminary talks between the Egyptian and Israeli Foreign Ministers and Mr Baker to be held in Washington early next month.
The aim of these talks will be to set up a dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo on elections in the occupied territories.
The Washington talks will centre on the crucial issue of who will represent the Palestinians.
On the official level, the PLO is still insisting that ‘it is ready to accept to deal with the Baker plan’ but only if the composition of the Palestinian delegation is publicly selected by the PLO.
Egyptian insistence on this position would lead to a withdrawal of Israeli participation, given the refusal of the Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, to deal directly with the PLO.
The Egyptians, while insisting that they do not speak for the Palestinians, appear ready to fudge the principle of PLO selection of the Palestinian delegation to ensure Israeli participation.
A source close to the Egyptian foreign ministry said: ‘We are trying to circumvent the ideological issue.
We will choose PLO delegates.
Any Palestinian who speaks will have to have the approval of the PLO, but this will not be said publicly because we don't want to give Shamir the chance to withdraw, which we think he's looking for an excuse to do.’
Reports from Jerusalem yesterday showed the usual split in government reaction.
The Defence Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, welcomed the Egyptian acceptance of the Baker plan, while Mr Shamir's aide, Mr Avi Pazner, gave a restrained response.
‘We are waiting to receive the content of the Egyptian response from the United States,’ Mr Pazner said.
‘When we receive it we will study it carefully and later decide how to react.’
The Americans are clearly hoping that it will be possible to bring the Palestinians and Israelis around the negotiating table without confronting the contradictions and achieve an historic breakthrough.
The PLO leader, Mr Yasser Arafat, who was in Cairo earlier this week, appears to be giving tacit support to the Egyptian strategy.
He has, at least, not publicly opposed Egypt's diplomatic initiatives.
The Egyptian Foreign Minister, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, yesterday undercut recent reports that a rift was developing between the PLO and Egypt.
He said in Tunis that Egypt had held consultations with the PLO before officially accepting the Baker plan.
Bulgaria politburo purged ahead of protest rallies.
By Denise Searle and Mike Power in Sofia
BULGARIA'S new leader, Mr Petar Mladenov, yesterday purged many hardliners from the Communist Party's ruling politburo and central committee, while heaping blame for the country's political and economic crisis on the former leader, Mr Todor Zhivkov.
At a hurriedly called top-level Communist Party meeting, Mr Mladenov said he was responding to public pressure and requests from Communist Party members by removing Mr Zhivkov from the central committee.
The meeting also withdrew the vote of thanks given to Mr Zhivkov when he was forced to resign as Communist Party and state leader on November 10.
‘Todor Zhivkov was involved in a painful period for the Communist Party,’ said an official statement.
‘We would not be living up to our responsibilities if we did not listen to ordinary party members.’
This is the second significant Communist Party clear-out in the four weeks since Mr Mladenov seized power.
He has steadily distanced himself from Mr Zhivkov's heavy-handed policies and introduced more tolerance in Bulgaria.
Most of the population have welcomed Mr Mladenov's reforms, although he has been criticised for leaving some of Mr Zhivkov's supporters in prominent positions.
Yesterday's clear-out removed the last of the hardliners from the politburo.
A key addition is the liberal, Mr Alexander Lilov, who was dismissed from the politburo in 1983, without explanation, for differing with Mr Zhivkov.
Similar radical changes have been made in the central committee, with 20 old faces going, including the deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Ivan Ganev.
The reshuffle clears the decks before Monday's crucial scheduled central committee's meeting which is expected to reveal alarming details about Bulgaria's ailing economy and to tackle the problem of Mr Zhivkov's internationally comdemned assimilation policy against the country's Turkish minority.
The changes also anticipate many of the demands which were expected to be made at opposition rallies tomorrow in Sofia and the provinces where calls are expected for the resignation of many of the figures ousted yesterday.
The old guard hit back at the newly formed, broad-based Union of Democratic Forces, which is organising tomorrow's demonstrations.
Posters have appeared around the city giving the wrong date, time, and place, and the central committee secretariat has written to every Communist Party organisation in the country criticising the Union of Democratic Forces.
A Union of Democratic Forces spokesman, Mr Georgi Spassov, said: ‘This demonstrates that we have a long way to go before we have true democracy in Bulgaria.’
Hrawi will resign unless Aoun goes.
By Reuter in Beirut
PRESIDENT Elias Hrawi has threatened to resign if he fails to topple General Michel Aoun, whom he accused of blocking his way to unite and bring peace to Lebanon.
‘I did not come to the presidency to become a president who will consolidate partition or to manage a crisis,’ he said yesterday.
‘I have come to restore Lebanon's unity and extend the sovereignty of the government over Lebanese territory.
‘When my patience runs out with all the mediation and when I exhaust my capabilities I will issue a statement to all Lebanese and apologise.
I will tell them ‘this is your actual situation’, and leave.’
Mr Hrawi has not been able to move into the presidential palace in the Beirut suburb of Baabda because it is occupied by Gen Aoun.
He said foreign mediators had asked him not to use force to break Gen Aoun's control of the enclave.
He refused to set a time within which he would step down, saying he was giving diplomacy time to solve the crisis peacefully.
It was essential to act quickly to avert the partition of Lebanon into religious cantons.
‘The country is living on a volcano, in a field of mines,’ he said.
‘I am against war and operations which disrupt peace and cause death and destruction,’ Mr Hrawi said.
But he added that patience had limits and he might wait a few days or two weeks.
Syrian forces, Lebanese troops, and militiamen have been poised for a week for an attack to seize the palace.
Diplomatic sources said Syria had increased its troops in Lebanon from about 30,000 to 45,000 since Mr Hrawi's election.
Mr Hrawi said no decision had been taken yet for a military showdown.
He accused Gen Aoun of using as ‘sandbags’ the thousands of Christians who have gathered outside the palace to deter an attack.

Spain swears in unchanged cabinet.
By John Hooper in Madrid
THE Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, decided against reshuffling his cabinet to stabilise a political climate which had become increasingly unpredictable since the October 29 general election, sources close to him said yesterday.
The unchanged team was sworn in yesterday by King Juan Carlos.
Fresh elections are pending in three of Spain's 52 constituencies after judges annulled the results, citing widespread irregularities.
The quasi-liberal Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which topped the poll six weeks ago, is now one seat short of an overall majority in the Congress of Deputies.
The Socialists suffered a sharp drop in votes and seats.
Mr Gonzalez managed to win a vote of confidence in the first round only with the support of a Canary Islands deputy who is widely regarded as a parliamentary spokesman and lobbyist for the Tenerife banana planters.
Mr Luis Mardones was the only deputy elected for the Independent Groupings of the Canaries (AIC).
An unchanged cabinet had been widely expected, but only as a temporary measure because of the uncertainty caused by the courts.
The verdicts gave up to three months for new polls to be held.
Government sources, however, suggested that that the Prime Minister would not necessarily change his team after the final outcome became known.
Several opposition parties interpreted Mr Gonzalez's attitude as defiance of public opinion.
A spokesman for the largest opposition group, the People's Party, said the Prime Minister was acting ‘as if nothing had changed’.
Mr Gonzalez has also come in for criticism from within his own party.
A leader of Socialist Left, a radical pressure group, said the confirmation in office of the old team was ‘a serious mistake, because it signals the endorsement of an economic policy criticised by a lot of people’.
Mr Mardones cast his decisive vote, on Tuesday night, after the Prime Minister promised to ‘consider’ his tiny group's demands.

Soviet Union appears to accept reunification of two states is inevitable Kremlin agrees to plan for German confederation.
By Hella Pick Diplomatic Editor
THE Soviet Union accepts in principle confederation between East and West Germany, and expects that this key move towards German reunification will be ratified next year at the summit meeting of the 35 signatories of the Helsinki Declaration.
This has emerged from briefings by the West German Foreign Minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, to members of the German Bundestag about his visit to Moscow earlier this week.
It represents an important clarification of the Soviet position on German unity, after Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Foreign Minister, and other senior Soviet spokesmen took issue with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 10-point plan for German reunification.
It seems to show that the Soviet Union has already accepted the inevitability of a drawing together of the two Germanys.
The Soviet leader's main aim for the summit, apart from celebrating the conclusion of a treaty on conventional arms cuts in Europe, would be to discuss the German question within the context of the momentous changes in East-West relations.
Mr Gorbachev insists, as a condition to German confederation, that the 35 — which include the US and Canada, as well as the two Germanys and all other European states except Albania — must formally reaffirm the permanence of the Oder-Neisse line, the present Polish-German border.
This would also bind an eventually merged Germany, which the Soviet Union recognises might be born when Nato and the Warsaw Pact give way to a new European security system.
President Bush also came away from his talks with Mr Gorbachev in Malta convinced that the Soviet leader recognised that German reunification may turn out to be unavoidable, but that it must come as part of a wider European endeavour to end the post-war division of Europe.
The Soviet leader's main concern is to avoid an ‘artificial’ acceleration of the process.
But, as Mr Gorbachev said at his Malta press conference, ‘in order to remain realists, we should say that history decides the processes and fates on the European continent, and also the fates of those two [German]states.’
Mr Gorbachev first called for a Helsinki 2 summit next year in Rome last week.
He envisaged a ‘commonwealth of sovereign democratic states’ to give substance to his concept of a common European home.
President Franois Mitterrand voiced strong support for the idea after his meeting with President Gorbachev in Kiev on Wednesday.
President Bush has agreed that the conventional arms treaty should be signed at summit level, and the Americans know that this means in practice that Mr Gorbachev will have his Helsinki 2.
Although only the 23 Nato and Warsaw Pact countries are directly involved in the arms negotiations, the treaty will come under the umbrella of all Helsinki Declaration countries.
Nato and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers are expected to meet in Vienna in March to review progress of the conventional arms negotiations.
The two Germanys do not need foreign approval before moving towards confederation, the head of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrat party, Mr Volker Ruehe, said in an interview published today.
Temple raises bid for SeaCo to $1.036bn
EC leaders give spur to single market reforms.
By Larry Elliott Economics Correspondent
LEADERS of the 12 European Community nations yesterday added impetus to progress towards a single market in 1992, while admitting that several important issues remained to be solved.
Although much of the attention at the summit was inevitably focused on the changes in Eastern Europe and the drive towards monetary union, the starting point for the talks, particularly from the British delegation's viewpoint, was the need to speed up the 1992 reforms.
The troubled programme has been bedevilled by the tardiness of some countries in implementing the 278 proposals required to remove all internal frontiers to business, and Mrs Thatcher found herself in the slightly unusual position of being praised by Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, for being in the vanguard of the reform process.
Britain has already implemented 60 per cent of the required changes, sharing with Denmark the best record among the 12, and the Prime Minister put pressure on her EC partners to move faster.
The West German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, indicated that he was prepared to make concessions on his country's merger and anti-cartel controls, one of a number of key obstacles to meeting the January 1, 1993 deadline for the single market.
There is now hope that the meeting, later this month, of ministers responsible for the creation of the single market will be able to finalise the discussions on competition policy.
The 12 also chipped away at one of the other stumbling blocks, the need to harmonise tax laws across the Community.
It appeared from yesterday's talks that there was general agreement on a VAT system, based on the principle of ‘the exporter pays’, although the vexed subjects of VAT rates and Custom duties remained unresolved.
There also appeared to be less dissension on state aid and subsidies, a subject given added poignancy by the recent revelations about the UK Government's ‘sweeteners’ to British Aerospace at the time of the takeover of Rover.
Mrs Thatcher's call for a ‘level playing field’ was found ‘somewhat ironic’by other delegations, in the light of the domestic row the sale caused.
The agreement on the liberalisation of air travel earlier this week was also seen as a promising step towards 1992, as was the compromise deal on telecommunications reached on Thursday.
President Mitterrand emphasised that improvements to the European infrastructure and the transport network had not yet gone far enough, a view echoed by Mrs Thatcher.
Research and development and financial services are two further areas where progress is still slow.
Although the 1992 reforms are intended to create a single market for labour, as well as goods and services, both the French and West German delegations expressed doubts about the need to control an influx of immigrants.
Rebel troops end siege of Manila area.
By Sheila Coronel in Manila
ABOUT 400 rebel soldiers returned to their barracks yesterday morning, ending the siege of Makati after they had occupied the capital's affluent business district for six days.
The mutineers, all members of an elite scout-ranger regiment, marched to a nearby army camp, defiantly saying that they did not surrender to the government.
‘We have won some victories,’ said Capitain Danilo Lucas, a West Point graduate who took part in the rebellion.
‘We are not surrendering, we are voluntarily going back to barracks.’
In the central Philippine city of Cebu, meanwhile, negotiations with the 200 army rebels who seized an air force base are at a stalemate.
The air force general leading the mutineers refused to give up control of the base even as the seige of Makati ended.
As the military mutiny dragged on for the sixth day, President Corazon Aquino asked Filipinos to ‘join hands and consolidate our resources to rebuild what we have destroyed’.
Military officers said more disruptions by mutinous soldiers were still possible.
‘I can not guarantee that there will be no more coup attempts,’ said the armed forces spokesman, Brigadier-General Oscar Florendo.
During a meeting yesterday, Mrs Aquino told her cabinet ‘to take a long, hard look at ourselves in order to see what it is we did wrong and what else needs to be done so we can all benefit from this tragic experience in our lives’.
She is expected to implement measures to address the popular grievances that have helped to fuel the mutiny.
In the past month, Mrs Aquino's popularity has declined, and there was growing disenchantment with her government's ability to provide adequate transport and power, and to contain corruption.
Government officials say that state of emergency declared by Mrs Aquino on Wednesday should make it easier for the government to control prices and improve transport and other services.
The decree allows the government to take over public utilities and businesses.
A cabinet reshuffle is expected to follow.
Replacing cabinet secretaries who are popularly perceived as ineffective was ‘part of the stocktaking that has to be done’, the press Secretary, Mr Adolfo Azcuna, said.
At the same time, Mrs Aquino is mobilising popular support for her beleaguered government.
In an emotional television appeal yesterday, she called on Filipinos to bring their families to a mass today at a religious shrine on a main motorway in suburban Manila.
The spot marks the place where where hundreds and thousands gathered in February 1986 for a popular uprising that overthrew the late President Ferdinand Marcos, and made Mrs Aquino the President.
Cardinal Jaime Sin, the influential Archbishop of Manila, who called on Filipinos to support the uprising against Marcos, joined Mrs Aquino's appeal.
‘The future of the nation is in your hands,’ he said in a radio broadcast.
The rebels left Makati after negotiations with military officers and marched back to their barracks with rifles, bazookas, and machine-guns, chanting: ‘No surrender, the fight goes on.’
Brigadier-General Arturo Enrile, the government negotiator, said the mutineers had initially demanded Mrs Aquino's resignation, but eventually ‘reason prevailed over whatever political or ideoligical convictions they had.’
Gen Enrile went on: ‘I told them they would be treated fairly, justly and humanely but they must be man enough to take the consequences of their actions.’
At the camp, the rebel troops were welcomed with a banner that read: ‘Welcome home.’
They shook hands and embraced government soldiers.
‘We will not surrender even if it takes forever,’ said Corporal Roy Bantung.
‘The government must change.
The president must change her policies.’
Syrians move in to quell fighting.
By Agencies in Beirut
SYRIAN troops opened fire in Muslim West Beirut yesterday to enforce a ceasefire after more than 24 hours of fighting between rival Shi'ite groups.
Syrians moved into at least five neighbourhoods where the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah have been fighting since noon on Thursday.
Twelve people are thought to have been killed and 20 wounded since Thursday, including two militiamen killed by Syrian troops yesterday.
Police said the dead included four children less than eight years old shot by snipers in their homes overnight.
Hassan Hamdan, aged seven, was shot in the head by a sniper when he switched on the light at his bedroom in Mossaitbeh, a poor residential district controlled by Amal.
Syrian troops are believed to have rounded up many militiamen in the Bourj Abou Haidar area, where the fiercest fighting erupted.
Residents began to leave their bomb shelters as the Syrian presence quelled fighting.
One, Wisal Wehbeh, said: ‘I will never feel safe until militias are disbanded for good because the minute the Syrians go away, the militiamen come back.’
Aminah Mu'asher, who lives in Bourj Abou Haidar, said: ‘I heard a militiaman shout Allah-o-Akbar (God is great) when he was shot…
His blood is still on the pavement.
‘We're living in hell.
This fighting has no meaning.
It only brings more destruction.
‘Brothers are killing each other.
People have no logic or human values left.’
The fighting dealt another blow to the government of President Elias Hrawi, striving to impose his authority on General Michel Aoun, the Christian leader, who opposes Syria's presence in Lebanon.
Gen Aoun has rejected the Arab League-brokered peace accord under which Mr Hrawi was elected last month.
The government, in an effort to tighten the grip on Gen Aoun, dismissed Lebanon's ambassador to the US, Mr Abdallah Bouhabib, who has been supporting the general's policies for more than 15 months.
A government statement said a replacement for Mr Bouhabib will be named soon.
Syria has reinforced its troops facing the Christian enclave where Gen Aoun is entrenched, but has said it plans no immediate attack.
The Syrian Information Minister, Mr Mohammed Salman, said: ‘The only reason Syria has so far discounted the military option to end Gen Aoun's rebellion is its desire to avert huge losses among civilians in the eastern sector of Beirut.
‘The Syrian forces could, if they wanted, speedily resolve the problem of Gen Aoun in Lebanon through military means, but the Syrian leadership is fully convinced there will be no need to resort to this as Gen Aoun's removal is a matter of time and will take place quickly through political means.’.
The three foreign ministers of the Arab League committee on Lebanon are to visit Damascus today at the start of a new drive to end the crisis caused by Gen Aoun's defiance.
They are also due to visit Iraq, France and the Vatican.

Thatcher refuses to budge on unity.
By Alan Travis Political Correspondent
BRITAIN yesterday took comfort from reports of an alleged overnight breach between the West German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, and the French on the need to set a date for a Community monetary union conference.
Before she left for Strasbourg, Mrs Thatcher refused to budge in her hostility to the EC Social Charter and the Delors plan for economic and monetary union.
Senior ministers last night emphasised that the British position had remained unchanged since the Madrid summit, where they had stressed that adequate preparation had to be made long before stages II and III of the Delors plan could be settled.
They took comfort from Dr Kohl's apparent embrace of the need for more detailed discussion of the Delors proposals and more powers for the European Parliament and restated their belief that a conference on economic and monetary union should not be held hastily.
The ministers interpreted Dr Kohl's statement as a move towards their position.
The Prime Minister gave no hint during her performance in the Commons yesterday that her language at Strasbourg will be any less caustic than the manner she has adopted at recent Commonwealth summits.
She said she believed the adoption of the Social Charter would ‘cause a great increase in unemployment not only in this country but in others as well, and would probably end in Fortress Europe’.
Despite warnings, Mrs Thatcher stressed her leadership role in Europe, saying that it was Britain which had put up an alternative scheme to the Delors plan and had taken the initiative over the idea of associate EC status for East Germany.
These would be considered alongside the Delors plan, would go beyond its stage I, and would not require any central bank or common currency, but would result in more consistent monetary policies, Mrs Thatcher insisted.
The Labour front bench exploited the recent disclosures over hidden subsidies to sweeten the sale of the Rover Group, telling Mrs Thatcher that she went to Strasbourg with a tarnished reputation.
