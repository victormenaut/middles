Letter to the Editor: Pope's guidance in election
SIR — Can I, as a Catholic, following the guidance of Pope John Paul II, vote for the Labour Party manifesto?
That depends on how seriously I take the special letter on the life issues of abortion and euthanasia he wrote last May to his bishops.
He urged them to act decisively for ‘the inviolable right to life, which belongs to every person from conception until life's natural end’.
Earlier in 1991 he had urged ‘the promotion of the culture of life in the face of the culture of death’.
He castigated the anti-life practices of abortion and euthanasia as ‘crimes of totalitarianism against the most defenceless of human beings’.
How far the different statements from the English bishops and the Scottish bishops do that is a matter of personal judgment.
Nothing is more important in life than life itself.
All other issues fade into insignificance compared with it.
I would personally not wish to live in a society which, no matter how secularly Utopian it may claim itself to be, kills its weakest members, namely the innocent unborn child and the old and/or terminally ill.
Abortifacient contraceptives, embryo experimentation and abortion itself deny the principle of the sanctity of life from conception onwards and so pave the way for euthanasia.
I would therefore vote for a Labour candidate only if he or she guarantees opposition to the party manifesto's support for abortion to the extent of denying the Whip.
As the Conservative and Liberal Democrat manifestos do not mention pro-life issues, my task is easier.
But it remains essential that I know their candidates' attitudes before deciding.
It will probably be easier for them to be pro-life because of the absence of party pressure on them.
In the case of an MP seeking re-election, I will be strongly influenced by voting record.
