Update.
By SALES of unleaded fuel continue to climb.
This week's figures suggest that one in three motorists are buying unleaded, despite the confusion which still exists about which cars can run on which fuel.
In an attempt to clarify the issue, Esso has brought out a new edition of their guide to motorists about which cars can run on unleaded fuel.
It is less ambiguous than the previous version but still suggests that if your car will run on standard unleaded petrol, it will run even better on Super Plus unleaded.
It ain't necessarily so, but you won't hurt the engine by trying â€” only your wallet.
By the way, I deplore the practice employed by some filling stations of having several premium unleaded pumps on the forecourt but tucking the standard and cheaper fuel, away in a corner.
P for safety.
TRIPS to Ireland recently have reinforced my view that the P (probationer) plate carried by those cars driven by people who have passed their driving test within the last year, are a good thing and should be adopted here.
Any parent with youngsters learning to drive would be reassured by such a plate and experienced drivers seeing the P-plate can treat the car with respect.
P drivers could even be limited to low speeds.
Opinions?
