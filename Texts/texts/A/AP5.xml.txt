The Family Today
What is a family?
Views about what constitutes a typical family vary.
The General Household Survey for example defines the family today as ‘a married couple living alone or with their children, or a lone parent with his or her children, in each case the children being never married’.
Whatever its interpretation, there can be little doubt that the structure of family life is changing.
The decline of marriage, increasing cohabitation and extra-marital childbearing and the emergence of new family structures arising from greater divorce, remarriage and lone parenthood has meant that the traditional image of the family, of a married couple with dependent children, is less common today than in the past.
The growing diversity of family patterns has received widespread public and political attention in recent years.
Nevertheless, continuities in family life are also important.
It remains the case today that most people in Britain marry and have children and that most marriages last a lifetime.
This fact sheet examines the family today.
it looks at the context of family life, ageing, the role of work and the division of labour within the household.
Marriage
In 1989, there were 347 thousand marriages in England and Wales, and of these 219,000 were first marriages for both husband and wife.
First marriages have fallen since the 1970s.
Only 63% of marriages were between a bachelor and spinster in 1989, compared with 79% in 1971.
A growing proportion of marriages involve remarriage for one or both partners.
In 1989, 20% were first marriages for one partner only compared with 12% in 1971.
The increase in the proportion of remarriages reflects the implementation of the Divorce Law Reform Act in 1969, after which the number of divorces rose sharply.
Age at first marriage has increased rapidly in the last two decades.
Between 1971 and 1981, the average age at first marriage rose from 22.6 to 23.1 (women) and 24.6 to 25.4 (men).
This trend has persisted in the 1980s; by 1989 the mean age at marriage stood at 24.8 for women and 26.9 for men.
One reason for the later age at marriage is the growing popularity of premarital cohabitation.
Fewer marriages now involve teenagers.
Only 2% of bridegrooms and 8% of brides were under 20 years old in 1989; in 1971, the proportions were 9% and 27% respectively.
This trend reflects a steady decline in the teenage marriage rate since 1970.
The majority but a declining proportion of people eventually marry.
If present marriage rates continue, then the expected proportions of men and women married by age 50 would be around 77% for men and 78% for women, compared with 93% of women and 96% of men in 1971.
Table 1 shows these changing marriage patterns between 1971 and 1989.
Cohabitation
The sharp fall in marriage rates since the early 1970s has been accompanied by a rise in the proportion of cohabiting couples.
General Household Survey data indicate that in 1979, just 3% of women aged 18–49 and 8% of single women were cohabiting; by 1988 this had increased to 8% and 20% respectively.
The duration of cohabitation, however, has remained virtually unchanged.
Amongst never married women the period increased only slightly from 18 months in 1979 to 19 months in 1987.
Living together before marriage has become increasingly common.
Just under half (48%) of women marrying for the first time in 1987 had lived with their husbands prior to marriage compared with 19% of those marrying in the late 1970s and only 7% of those marrying in 1971.
Cohabitation between marriages has also grown in popularity.
Whereas 1 in 4 marriages were preceded by cohabitation in the 1960s, the corresponding proportion in the 1980s is about 7 in 10.
The period of cohabitation prior to remarriage has also increased in the 1980s, from 28 months in 1979 to 34 months in 1987.
(Haskey and Kiernan, 1989).
There are important geographical variations in the proportion of unmarried people (single, separated and divorced) cohabiting in Great Britain.
The 1988 General Household Survey found that in general, the further north or west the region, the lower the proportion of cohabiting couples.
As Figure 1 shows, the proportions cohabiting are highest in East Anglia and the South East, while the proportions in Scotland and Wales are around half these levels.
Family formation
Extra-marital childbearing
The proportion of children born outside marriage has risen dramatically in recent years.
Between 1964 and 1990, the number of births outside marriage increased from 63 thousand to 200 thousand, while the proportion of all births that they represent more than quadrupled from 7% to 29%.
In the year ending March 1991 provisional estimates are 204 thousand such births or 28.7% of total births.
The  proportion of births outside marriage between 1971 and 1989 are shown by age of mother in Table 2.
Just over three-quarters of births to women under 20 were outside marriage in 1989, compared with 37% in 1977 and 8% in 1971.
The largest increases have been to women aged 20–24; about 4 in 10 of their births were outside marriage in 1989, more than four times the proportion in 1971.
The rise in childbearing outside marriage is closely linked with cohabitation.
The proportion of births jointly registered by both parents has increased from 46% in 1971 to 71% in 1989.
Of the joint registrations made in 1989, 72% were made by parents living at the same address, which suggests that some 50% of children born outside marriage were born to a cohabiting couple.
This is a much larger proportion than that found among teenage women, where only about 1 in 3 were cohabiting at the time of the birth.
The pattern of outcome of conceptions outside marriage has changed considerably since the early 1970s.
Of unmarried women who became pregnant, the proportion who married the father before the baby was born fell from 40% in 1970 to 11% in 1988, whereas the proportion of pregnancies terminated by abortion rose from 24% to 37%.
Thus, while marrying the father was the most likely outcome of an extra-marital conception in 1970; by 1988, single women were more likely to terminate the pregnancy or give birth to the child without marrying the father (Figure 2).
A more detailed description of teenage fertility behaviour is given in the companion fact sheet ‘Young People’.
Childbearing within marriage
The majority of children today are born to married couples.
Of children born in 1989, 67% were to couples in their first marriage.
This compares with 82% in 1980 and 89% in 1970.
In 1989, 6% of children were born to women in their second or later marriage.
Women today start their families later in life.
For example, in 1964, the average age of mothers having their first child was 24 years, by 1980 it had risen by 6 months and by 1989 it stood at 25.3.
Among married women, average age has risen even more sharply, from 24.3 years in 1964 to 25.2 in 1980 and 26.9 in 1989.
A commonly used indicator of fertility behaviour is the Total Period Fertility Rate (TPFR).
This measures the average number of children a woman would have if she experienced the prevailing age pattern of childbearing throughout her reproductive lifetime.
In 1989, the TPFR stood at 1.80, 4% below the recent peak of 1.88 achieved in 1980.
Changes in the TPFR should be interpreted with caution, however, as they can be affected by short-term changes in the timing of childbearing.
A more sensitive indicator of fertility behaviour is the average completed family size of women born in the same year.
Table 3 shows that although the vast majority of women eventually have children, families have become smaller over time.
The proportion of women having just two children, for example, rose from 28% for the 1920s generation to 43% for those born in 1945.
It is projected to remain at around this level for more recent generations of women.
Ethnic minorities
Fertility rates vary according to area or country of birth of the mother.
In general, however, they tend to be higher among those born outside the UK than for UK born mothers.
In 1989, the Total Period Fertility Rate for mothers born in the Caribbean was 1.6, slightly lower than the UK average of 1.8.
Mothers born in India had an average fertility of 2.4 and mothers from Pakistan and Bangladesh 4.7.
Since the 1970s fertility rates have dropped for all women in the UK irrespective of country of origin.
The greatest falls have occurred among Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi born women.
Divorce
England & Wales has one of the highest divorce rates in Europe
In 1989, 151 thousand divorces were granted to couples in England and Wales, a rate of 12.7 per thousand marriages.
Divorce rates doubled in the 1970s, following the legislation in 1969 which introduced the irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce.
In 1961, before the Divorce Law Reform Act was introduced, the divorce rate was only 2.1.
During the 1980s, around 150 thousand married couples a year have experienced a divorce.
The peak figure of 160 thousand divorces in 1985 reflects further legislative change in 1984 (the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act), which allowed couples to petition for divorce after one year of marriage instead of three.
Over time, divorces have occurred at increasingly shorter durations of marriage.
Of marriages that took place in 1951, 10% had ended in divorce by 25 years, in contrast 10% of couples who married in 1971 were divorced by their 6th wedding anniversary and of those married in 1981, 10% had divorced within 4.5 years.
Estimates suggest that if divorce rates prevailing in the 1980s continue, then just under 4 in 10 (37%) marriages contracted in the mid 1980s are likely to end in divorce (Haskey, 1989).
Redivorce is becoming increasingly common.
Since the early 1970s, the proportion of divorces involving a second or later marriage for one partner more than doubled, from 7% in 1971 to 16% in 1989.
Nearly one quarter of the divorces in 1989 involved a second or subsequent divorce for one or both partners (Table 4).
Children and Divorce
One in four children today will experience a parental divorce before their sixteenth birthday
A growing proportion of children are affected by family breakdown.
In 1989, the number of children under 16 with parents who divorced was 148 thousand.
Of these, one third were aged under five.
If present trends continue, it is estimated that around 1 in 4 children will experience the divorce of their parents before they reach 16 (Haskey, 1990).
Table 5 shows the number of children experiencing the divorce of their parents, by age between 1971 and 1989.
Lone Parent Families
In the last decade, the number of families headed by a lone parent had grown by more than one third, reaching an estimated total of 1,010 thousand in 1986.
Almost one in five families with dependent children are lone parent families
One parent families have also increased as a proportion of all families with dependent children (Table 6).
The proportion of all families with dependent children headed by a lone parent increased from 8% in 1971 to 19% in 1990.
Almost all of this increase was attributable to the growing proportion of lone mother families, which more than doubled over the period.
The  proportion headed by a lone father, at 2%, has remained virtually unchanged in the last two decades.
Nine out of ten lone parents are women
Almost one third of lone parents are single mothers
In 1989, divorced women represented the largest single group of lone parents (33%).
Single mothers were the next largest group, at around 31%, and separated mothers, widows and lone fathers the smallest groups.
Divorced and never married mothers show the largest increases
The proportion of lone parent families arising from divorce have shown the largest increases between 1976 and 1986 — almost 80% in the decade.
This is due in part to rising divorce rates, but also because remarriage rates among divorced women have fallen in recent years.
There has been a similar increase in the proportion of families headed by a never-married mother over the period (77%), arising from a growth in the proportion of births outside marriage as well as the growing trend for single mothers to bring up children by themselves.
Widowed lone mothers account for a small and declining number of lone parent families.
Changing mortality and fertility patterns are likely to have contributed to this fall (Table 7).
Single mothers tend on average to be younger than other lone parents.
The median age of lone mothers in 1978/88 was 24 for single mothers and 32, 36, and 45 years for separated, divorced and widowed mothers respectively (GHS, 1990).
One in eight children live in a lone parent family
Children
In 1986, about 1.6 million children were living in a lone parent family.
Families headed by lone parents have fewer children than two parent families, with an average 1.6 dependent children compared with 1.8.
Families headed by single lone mothers have the lowest number of dependent children (1.3) and are the only category of lone mother family in which family size has not declined (Haskey, 1989).
Regional Variation
The 1981 census found that compared with the national average of 14%, inner urban areas have particularly heavy concentrations of lone parent families.
The average for inner London was 26.6%, and just under 1 in 3 families in Lambeth (32%) and Hackney (31%) were headed by lone parent families.
Ethnic Differences
The proportion of lone parent families varies significantly between the different ethnic groups.
The highest proportion of lone parent families occur amongst the Afro-Caribbean groups; 42% of all West Indian/Guyanese and 24% of all African families are lone parent families.
Very few families of Asian origin are headed by a lone parent.
Only 8% of Asian families are lone parent families, compared with 18% of all minority groups.
(Haskey, 1989)
Financial Circumstances
Lone parent families are more likely to be living in poverty than two parent families.
In 1985, 63% of lone parent families (with nearly a million children) were either in receipt of Supplementary Benefit (SB) or had incomes below the level of SB, compared with 10% of two parent families with dependent children.
For further information on lone parenthood see the companion fact sheets ‘One Parent Families’ and ‘Family Finances’.
Remarriage
The number and proportion of remarriages have risen sharply in the last two decades.
In 1971, about 10% of marriages involved the first marriage of one party to a divorced partner and 4% involved the remarriage of two divorcees; by 1989, these proportions had risen to 19% and 13% respectively.
Remarriage rates (the number of marriages per thousand divorced persons) have fallen continuously since the 1970s, largely due to the growing popularity of cohabitation between marriages.
However, a large proportion of divorcees do eventually remarry.
The 1988 General Household Survey found that 29% of women and 36% of men divorced during the period 1981–84 had remarried within 2 years of divorce.
Among those divorcing between 1977 and 1980, 52% of women and 67% of men had remarried within 6 years of divorce.
Children
The majority of children under 16 live with both their natural parents.
In 1985, 8 out of 10 children lived in a family headed by both natural parents (78% in a family headed by a married couple and 2% with cohabiting parents).
For older children, the picture changes somewhat — as divorce, remarriage and lone parenthood make an impact.
Only 76% of 10–15 year olds lived with both natural parents as compared with 84% of children under 5.
Table 8: Children by age and where currently living 1979 and 1985, Great Britain
The overwhelming majority of children, 98%, live with their natural mother.
Of those living with one natural parent in 1985, some 10% lived with a lone mother.
A smaller proportion, 1 in 11 children under 16, live with a natural mother and stepfather in a reconstituted family formed by cohabitation or remarriage.
Older children are more likely to be living with step-parents; 5% of under fives lived with step-parents in 1985, compared with 12% of those aged 10–15.
As a consequence of increasing cohabitation, extramarital childbearing, divorce, remarriage and the rise of lone parenthood and step-families, children today are likely to experience a growing variety of family settings as they pass through childhood.
It is estimated that by the end of the century only about half of all British children will experience conventional family lives — parents married at the time they are born and continuing married until they are grown up (Kiernan & Wicks, 1990)
Ageing
Alongside the major family trends, it is also important to consider the ageing of the population in Britain.
More children today grow up in 3 or 4 generation extended families, with several grandparents alive and often some great-grandparents.
In 1901 one person in 20 was aged over 65, by 1981 this was about 1 in 7
The numbers of people aged 65 and over grew from 1.7 million to 8.8 million between 1901 and 1991, increasing as a proportion of the total population from 4.7% to 15.8%.
These numbers are projected to rise to 12 million or 20.5% of the total population by 2031.
Increases in the population aged over 65, in both proportionate and absolute terms have resulted from long term downward trends in the birth rate coinciding with decreased mortality rates.
It is important to differentiate between the ‘old elderly’ population (those aged 75+ and 85+) and the ‘young elderly’(65–74 years) because within the overall ageing of the population, the most significant changes are likely to occur among the very elderly, those aged 85 or more.
This group rose from 57,000 in 1901 to over half a million in 1981, and by 2031 is expected to treble in number to nearly 1.5 million.
Trends in the ageing of the population since the turn of the century and projections into the next are shown in Table 9.
The marital status of elderly persons is an important indicator of likely patterns of household formation; sources of help and care and degree of independence and isolation.
Figure 4 compares the marital status of men and women aged 65+ with that of men and women of all ages.
Nearly three-quarters (72%) of men aged over 65 are married and 1 in 5 are widowed.
The picture is rather different for women, due in part to longer female life expectancy but also because women tend to marry men that are older than themselves.
Just under 4 in 10 women aged 65 or over are married and one half are widowed.
More than one third of all those aged over 65 and half of those aged over 80 live alone
The household formation pattern of women over 80 is quite different from that of all elderly persons.
Among those aged 65 or more, 45% live with their spouse only and 11% live with relatives.
The likelihood of living alone is greatest among the most elderly, particularly for women.
In 1985, 55% of all people aged over 85 lived alone, but for men it was only 37% while 61% of women were in this position.
Family life today is likely to be affected by the extended family.
Extended families seldom live together in Britain, but the interaction between members of the extended family is likely to be important.
Care within the extended family often flows from the oldest generation to the youngest.
Women and Employment Survey data show that grandmothers are the major providers of care for children when mothers work full time.
Increasing old age is often associated with ill-health however, and many very aged people require help themselves.
General Household Survey data indicate that the major provider of care for the elderly in Britain is the family.
For further information on the elderly population see ‘An Ageing Population’ Fact Sheet.

Work and the Family
Young People
Since the school leaving age was raised to 16 in 1972/73, there have been enormous changes in the situation of young people.
Rising unemployment and the development of Government employment schemes have substantially altered the pattern of young people's activities.
In January 1988, just over half of all 16 year olds had left school and this group was split roughly in half between Youth Training Schemes (YTS) and the traditional labour market.
Of the labour market entrants roughly two-thirds found jobs and one-third were unemployed.
The most striking change between 1975 and 1988 has been the dramatic fall in youth employment from 60% to 20%.
The numbers unemployed and in education rose but a bigger change has been in the numbers on the Youth Training Scheme which was set up in 1983.
Not only does the pattern of young people's activities change over time, it also changes as they age.
Once young people reach their 20s, the paths followed by men and women are more likely to diverge because of family responsibilities (Roll, 1990).
For further information on young people, see ‘Young People’ Fact Sheet.
Working Mothers
A major trend which has had an effect on family life is the growth in the number of working women.
In 1931, 10% of married women were economically active (either in paid employment or unemployed).
By 1951 this had risen to 30% and by 1987 it stood at 60%.
Almost all of this increase was in part-time employment.
The number and age of children in the family are important influences on female employment patterns.
However, it is the age of the youngest child, particularly the presence of a child under 5, which is the major constraint.
In 1988, 32% of women with children aged under 3 were working (21% part-time, 11% full-time) compared with 73% with a youngest child aged 10 or over (43% part-time, 30% full-time)(Figure 7).
Married women are more likely than lone mothers to be in paid employment.
Among mothers with dependent children, 56% of married women were in full or part-time work in 1986/88 compared with 39% of lone mothers.
These differences are more pronounced among mothers with children under 5.
In the period 1986/88, 37% of married women with a child under 5 were working (26% part-time, 11% full time), while among lone parents the corresponding proportion was only 20% (12% part-time, 9% full-time).
Dual-worker families
One of the consequences of rising female employment has been a growth in the number of ‘dual-worker’ families.
In 1988, 58% of married couples with dependent children were both working as were 4 in 10 married couples with a child under 5.
For further information on female employment and child care provision see ‘Children Under 5’ Fact Sheet.
Unemployment
Although much attention has focused on the number of people out of work in recent years, less attention has been given to the number of family members who are also affected.
Unemployment tends to be concentrated within certain families.
In households where the head is unemployed, other household members are less likely to be in employment.
For example in 1983, only 30% of unemployed men had working wives, compared with 58% of employed household heads.
Unemployed  families are also more likely to have children who are themselves unemployed.
In 1982, 30% of jobless 16 and 17 year olds on supplementary benefit had family heads who were also receiving this benefit (Roll, 1990).
A large number of dependent children are affected by unemployment.
In 1987, over one million children were living in families with an unemployed head.
This situation was a long term one for many children, as Figure 8 illustrates.
Just over 4 in 10 (42%) dependent children in 1987 lived in a household where the head had been out of work for two or more years.
Lone parents have much smaller proportions of household heads in the labour market than two parent families.
Only 27% of lone parents had earnings as their main source of income in 1987, compared with 86% of two parent families.
For further information on family income see ‘Family Finances’ Fact Sheet.
The domestic division of labour
Despite the rise in female employment, women today perform the majority of tasks within the household.
The 1988 British Social Attitudes Survey found that traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning are more likely to be shared equally when the woman works full-time.
Yet even in these households the woman is primarily responsible for performing such tasks.
As Table 10 shows, in some 81% of households where a woman works full-time the washing and ironing is done by the woman.
The domestic duties of women who work part-time are very similar to those who are not in paid employment and in both cases are less likely to be shared by both partners.

The family in Europe
A European comparison of the family is given in Table 11.
The UK has one of the highest divorce rates in Europe.
It also ranks highly in terms of total fertility, illegitimate births and the number of elderly people.
Great Britain with Denmark has the highest proportion of lone parent families in the EC (14%).
there are great variations between the member states.
In Germany and France the proportion of lone parents is 12–13%; Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands 10–12%; Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland 5–10%.
The lowest proportions, at under 5%, are found in Greece.
Estimates suggest that in the European Community as a whole, at least 10% of families with children are lone parent families (Roll, 1989).

Supporting our Children
On 17 February 1991 the Government published their Child Support Bill.
Their proposals established the amount of child maintenance and a Child Support Agency to assess, collect and enforce maintenance payments.
This briefing paper examines the family impact of the proposals, their effect on men, women and children, and puts them in the context of a changing family demography and the often impoverished circumstances of lone parent families.
Lone Parents: policy in the doldrums
With government examining policy towards Britain's growing numbers of lone parents, this new paper discusses the issues and considers policy options.

What is a family?
As patterns of family life diversify and change, are current definitions of ‘the family’ realistic?
This report provides an overview of recent changes in policy makers' assumptions about the family, particularly in relation to the benefit system, where the recognition of relationships can mean more money for some and no money for others.
it describes the ways in which the definition of the family has changed, and considers whether it still needs to be reformed.

The Family Policy Studies Centre was established in February 1983 on the initiative of, and as a successor to, the Study Commission on the Family.
The Centre is concerned with the association between family trends and public policy and, in particular:
The understanding of demographic trends and contemporary family patterns, the changes that are taking place and the implications for policy and practice.
The analysis of the impact of public policy decisions on families of different kinds.
The Centre is an independent body, with charitable status.
It is free of any political affiliation and has no collective price.
FAMILY FORUM
In 1988 FPSC merged with Family Forum, the voluntary organisation concerned with family issues.
The Centre aims to maintain a strong focus on those questions affecting the voluntary sector and to maintain close links with it.
THE CENTRE'S WORK
The Family Policy Studies Centre acts as a Centre in two different respects.
Firstly as a resource for the study of family and policy questions, with its own research staff.
Secondly, as a Centre for information, dissemination and debate.
It acts as a bridge between research and policy.
THE CENTRE'S FUNDING
The Centre receives financial support from the Department of Health.
In addition, Abbey National provides office accommodation for the Centre.
Help the Aged support a programme of work on issues concerning the extended family and community care.
Support is also provided by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Economic and Social Research Council, the European Economic Community, and leading companies.

An Ageing Population
In Britain in 1991 it is estimated that there are 8,838,000 persons aged 65 and over (and more than 10 million of pensionable age), representing some 15.8% of the total population.
Life expectancy has increased dramatically this century.
Men and women born between 1910–12 could expect to live an average 53 years.
Those born between 1987–88 can expect to live an additional twenty years.
Life expectancy at birth is now an average 72 years for males and 78 years for females, but many people live much longer.
It is anticipated that life expectancy at birth will rise by 2–3 years over the next 40 years.
This fact sheet examines the trends which have produced an ageing population and reviews the social and economic characteristics of elderly people in Britain.
Numbers and trends
Increases in the elderly population — in both absolute and proportionate terms — have resulted from long term downward trends in the birth rate coinciding with decreased mortality at all ages.
The elderly population is expected to continue growing, in the foreseeable future, but at a slower rate than in the recent past.
However, by 2031 the number of people aged at least 65 will have reached over 12 million, a rise of 38% since 1991.
Between 1981 and the turn of the century the proportion of the population aged 65+ is expected to remain fairly steady at 15–16 per cent.
Thereafter, the ageing of the post-war baby boom generation becomes apparent, and by 2031 over one fifth of the population is expected to be aged 65+.
The increasing proportion of the population aged 65+ since the turn of the century is strikingly apparent in Figure 1.
Old age and retirement
The terms ‘old age’ and ‘retirement’are often used interchangeably, but they do not necessarily refer to the same things.
Many discussions of the elderly population include women of 60+.
Throughout this fact sheet (unless otherwise stated) we use the 65+ cut off for both sexes; the retired population is therefore larger than the elderly population.
While the numbers over any given age are a demographic fact, the numbers of pensioners will be determined by retirement and pensions policies.
The ‘Young Elderly’ and the ‘Old Elderly’
It makes little sense to describe everyone over the age of 60 or 65 as ‘the elderly population’, or ‘old people’.
Old age can cover a period often of 30–35 years or more: those just entering their retirement will be a generation younger than some of the oldest citizens.
A distinction is often made between the ‘young elderly’— aged 65–74 — and the ‘old elderly’— those aged 75+ or 85+.
Apart from the fact that these two main groups differ from each other in terms of physical, social and economic characteristics, the distinction is important because of the changing balance in the composition of the elderly population overall.
At the time of the 1901 census 71% of all people aged over 65 were aged between 65–74.
Just over half a million had passed their 75th birthday and only 57,000 were aged over 85.
In 1991 it is estimated that the young elderly represent 56% of all elderly persons, and further proportionate falls are anticipated.
By 2001 this younger group are expected to decline in absolute numbers by some 238,000 — around 5%.
This fall reflects in particular the low birth rates of the 1920s and 1930s.
The high birth rates of the 1950s and 1960s are projected to increase the numbers of young elderly from 2011.
The ageing of the elderly population itself is now of particular significance.
Current projections anticipate:
Between 1991 and 2001 the 75+ age group will grow from 44% to 48% of the elderly population.
By 2001 there will be over one million people aged 85 and over, representing 13% of all elderly people.
Trends in the ageing of the population since the turn of the century and projections into the next are shown in Figure 2 and Table 1.
Centenarians
The survival of more people to a very old age is clear if centenarians are considered.
While a 100th birthday is still unusual, the Royal congratulatory telegram is not the rarity it once was.
The present number of centenarians will not be known until the publication of the 1991 census.
A European Perspective
The demographic developments which have led to an ageing population in Britain are characteristic of all developed nations, with a trend towards lower birth rates and reduced mortality at all ages.
Trends throughout Europe are broadly similar, although the United Kingdom has, after Germany, the highest proportion of the population aged 60 and over.
Life expectancy in the United Kingdom, for both sexes, is, however, slightly below average for the whole European Community.
Excluding Belgium, the United Kingdom has the second lowest life expectancy for females in the Community, but as Table 3 demonstrates, the differences are small.
The countries with the highest proportions of people over 60 and 80, and the longest life expectancy are highlighted.
Regional Variations
The 1981 Census found broadly similar patterns in the overall proportions of elderly persons living in England, Scotland and Wales.
But great regional variations were apparent.
Population estimates for local government areas in England and Wales in 1988 provided an average 18.4% of the population of pensionable age.
Some areas however had very much higher proportions, suggesting patterns of migration and resettlement of retired people.
The areas with the highest proportions of people of pensionable age are located along the South East  coast extending to Dorset and Devon in the west.
Over a quarter of the population in East Sussex, the Isle of Wight and Dorset are retired, and more than 10% are aged 75 and over.
The home counties of Bedfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire have the lowest proportions of retired, with only around 14% of the population of pensionable age, and just 5% aged 75 and over.
Ethnic Minorities
The elderly population includes persons from various ethnic minorities.
It is a mistake to describe all such elderly people together since they originate from many quite different countries.
Very little research exists on ethnic elders in Britain.
As can be seen from Figure 4 the age profile of all ethnic minority groups is typically younger than that of the white population.
There are also differences between various groups which reflect different immigration patterns.
The most recent data found that only 4 ½%; of ethnic minorities had reached the age of 60 (Social Trends 21 1990).
The particular needs of elderly members of ethnic minorities will become more important over the next few decades as the population ages and its profile becomes similar to that of the white population.

Characteristics of Elderly Households
Marital status
The marital status of elderly persons is an important indicator of likely patterns of household formation; sources of help and care; and degree of independence and isolation.
From birth onwards there is a net surplus of males which then reverses in old age.
Men of all ages are more likely to remain single than women.
Only among elderly persons are there more never married women than men.
From middle age onwards lower proportions of women than men are married, and much higher proportions widowed.
The present generation — or ‘cohort’— of elderly persons includes disproportionately large numbers of women.
This reflects differential mortality rates at all ages which favours females, but it also indicates the impact of two world wars and the toll upon males.
Different trends will become apparent as these cohort effects diminish.
The charts below compare the marital status of men and women aged 65+ with that of men and women of all ages, and also the difference in marital status between men and women aged 75 and over.
Over s even in ten elderly men are married, but under four in ten elderly women.
One half of all women aged 65+ are widowed, compared to just one fifth of men in this age group.
Among the very elderly, 75 and over, the difference between the marital status of the sexes increases.
The proportion of married women falls to just over two in ten, and the proportion widowed rises to nearly two-thirds.
The figures for very elderly men are just over six in ten married, and nearly a third widowed.
Future trends in marital status
Future trends in marital status are subject to some uncertainty.
However, the National Insurance Fund long term financial estimates for 1990–2025 makes projections in which a number of features are apparent:
Both males and females are less likely to be widowed, but much more likely to be divorced.
Women are less likely to have remained unmarried, but men slightly more likely to reach old age as bachelors
Men are less likely in future to spend old age with their spouse, while women are more likely to be married.
This reflects in particular, women's reduced likelihood of being widowed.
What may prove to be important for future generations of elderly people in terms of care and living arrangements, is the numbers who will have experienced a divorce.
Currently very few people enter old age as divorcees.
However, if current divorce rates continue this will be true of many more in future.
While in 1990 one in 39 women aged 65+ and one in 44 males were divorced, by 2025 these proportions are expected to be, respectively, one in 8, and one in 12.
Household composition
The proportion of all adults living alone has risen from 9% in 1973 to 13% in 1988 (General Household Survey 1988).
Part of the increase is due to more young people forming independent households, but the most important factor has been the growth in numbers of elderly widows and widowers.
The likelihood of living alone is greatest among the most elderly, particularly for women.
In 1988 50% of all people aged over 75 lived alone, however, only 29% of men aged 75+ were living alone, compared to 61% of women (General Household Survey 1988).
The probability of living with other people also increases with age.
The household formation pattern of women over 80 is quite different from that of all elderly persons as Figure 6 illustrates.
The greater incidence of widowhood among women of this age means a much lower proportion living with their partner than is true for men, and a much increased likelihood both of living with children/children in law, and of living alone.
Not all elderly people have close relatives they might live with.
In 1973 30% of the over 75s had never had children, and 7.5% had actually outlived their children.
It might be expected that subsequent cohorts of elderly people will be more likely to have children, and be survived by them, but other social and economic trends may reduce their ability and willingness to assume caring responsibilities for aged parents.
Housing
Most elderly people live, as they have always done, ‘in the community’.
Only about 3–4% of all people aged 65+ are in some form of institutional care.
A further 5% live in ‘sheltered accommodation’.
How do the housing conditions of elderly people differ from those of other households?
Tenure and amenities
The 1989 General Household Survey found 64% of 2 adult households, in which 1 or both persons were aged 60+, were owner occupiers.
This was the same proportion as for all households.
The proportion of elderly couples who are tenants was also similar to the proportion of all households.
Lone elderly households, however, are different: being under-represented among owner occupiers, and over represented among council tenants and — especially — among private tenants of unfurnished accommodation.
Table 5 Tenure by Household type
Households aged 75 and over are more likely to live in unfit homes and lack basic amenities than other household types.
According to the 1986 English House Condition Survey, households 75+ only make up 10% of all households, but they occupy almost a third of dwellings lacking basic amenities and 16% of unfit dwellings.
6% of households headed by a person aged 75 and over lacked basic amenities (compared to under 2% for younger groups).
Over 6% occupied dwellings deemed unfit (compared to 3.9% for those under 75), and 14.9% of the oldest householders required repairs to their property of more than £1,000.
Single older people are more prone to suffer from a lack of amenities and occupy unfit dwellings than larger elderly households.
Although only a small minority of elderly households lack basic amenities or live in unfit dwellings, it is also important to question the suitability of the housing stock for older people's needs.
Size, the presence of steep stairs, dampness, and difficulty to heat, may mean that property is inappropriate.
Elderly people are also more likely to be found in homes lacking central heating.
A third of local authority dwellings lack any central heating, as does 64% of unfurnished privately rented accommodation.
Accordingly, while 76% of all households have central heating, this is only true for 66% of single elderly households (General Household Survey 1988).
Consumer durables
Ownership of particular consumer durables is a further reflection of standards of living.
Elderly couple households fare much the same as all households, but elderly persons living alone are much less likely to benefit from such goods.
Disability and age
While the vast majority of older people are able to live independently, significant minorities experience considerable difficulties.
There are clear associations between advancing years and increasing disability, and this is particularly steep among the most elderly.
The association between advancing years and increasing rates of disability is illustrated in Figure 7.
Disability rates start to climb steadily after 50, but become particularly steep after 70.
The most levels of disability remain low until about 70 and then rise quickly.
From about 75 more people have some level of disability than do not.
Increasing disability with age means a growing dependency on others, as indicated in Table 7.
Nearly one half of those aged 85+ are unable to walk down the road on their own, and nearly a third cannot manage stairs unaided.
Table 7 Disability and dependency
Future trends are uncertain.
However, if age specific rates of disability remain constant, average levels of disability are likely to rise as a larger proportion of the elderly population reaches extreme old age.
For many of the most elderly, remaining independent will be determined by the level of support and practical help provided by relatives, friends and by organised services.
Many statutory services are not keeping pace with demographic change.
Table 8 shows trends between 1976 and 1986 in the provision of some key services.
All services have grown in absolute terms, but in per capita terms the provision of meals and of home helps has not matched the growth in the population aged 75+ and 85+.

Care of Elderly People
Informal Carers
Of the estimated 6 million informal carers in Great Britain (3.5 million women and 2.5 million men), just over three quarters are looking after someone aged 65 and over, usually a spouse or a parent.
The majority of elderly people (76%) being cared for suffer from a physical disability only.
Carers with a dependant living in the same household spend more time caring than those with a dependant in another household.
Although the peak age for caring is 45–64, with one fifth of adults in this age group providing informal care, the 65 and over age group proportionately spend more time caring.
59% of elderly carers spend 50 hours or more per week caring.
This mainly reflects the care spouses give to one another, and underlines the importance of the spouse as the first source of care in old age.
Residential Care
From 1980 to 1988 the number of elderly people in residential care grew by 29%.
As Table 9 shows, most of this expansion occurred in the private sector, where there has been a threefold increase since 1980.
In contrast, there has been a gradual decline in local authority provision.
A number of possible reasons have been identified for the rapid expansion of private sector residential care: the increase in the numbers of very old people, the reduction in long-stay hospital provision, cuts in local authority spending, and finally, the ‘perverse incentives’ of the social security system that encourages residential rather than community care.
Changes to means tested board and lodging payments in 1980 enabled more elderly people, entitled to supplementary benefit (now income support), to meet the fees of private residential and institutional care.
Since then, the Government has introduced national limits on the benefit paid in order to control the escalating cost.
Despite these controls, the cost in 1980 was £18 million, in 1986 £459 million, £1.3 billion in 1990/91, and is estimated to reach £1.9 billion by the end of 1992/3 (Henwood et al., Briefing Paper 12, King's Fund Institute, 1991).
Because of the limits on income support payments there is increasing evidence of a shortfall between benefit levels and home fees, with resulting pressure on individual residents and their families to make up the deficit.
The rapidly rising cost of social security was a major reason for the Government's reform of community care, outlined in the White Paper, ‘Caring for People: Community Care in the Next Decade and Beyond’.
The changes include new arrangements for funding people on benefits in private residential care and nursing homes.
Caring for People was originally scheduled for implementation in April 1991, however, in July 1990 the Government announced that the reforms would be delayed and phased in over two years.
Public Expenditure
In 1987/88, English local authorities spent £1.3 billion on personal social services for elderly people.
This represented 45% of their net current expenditure on personal social services.
Just over half of all social security benefit expenditure in 1990/91, £28.5 billion, will go to people aged 60 and over.
Given the relationship between advancing years and increasing levels of disability, it is not surprising that the very old consumer large amounts of health care.
People over 85 cost the health service, on average, more than 13 times as much as peopled aged 5–64.
Because of the projected increase in the numbers aged 85 and over, ti has been estimated that by 2000, it will cost the NHS an additional £400 million a year, and more in later years (Britain in 2010, The PSI Report, 1991).
Early Retirement
A trend towards early retirement has been evident since the early 1970s.
In 1971 83% of men aged 60–64 were economically active.
By 1986 this proportion had fallen to 54%.
Since then there has been a very slight reversal of this trend, but the proportions are projected to fall again by 2001 (Social Trends 21, 1991).
This early retirement pattern has not been so evident for women.
Between 1971 and 1979 there was an increase in the economic activity of women aged between 55 and 59, from 51% to 54%.
This fell back to 51% at the beginning of the 1980s, and only recovered in 1989.
The rate is expected to remain at 54% until the end of the century.
Employment rates for women over 60 fell from 12.4% to 7.6% over the same period.
Trend data on employment and economic activity rates for women are less reliable, particularly given their low unemployment registration rates.
Concern over the rising cost of public expenditure on pensions, and the shortage of young people entering the labour market, because of falling birth rates in the 1970's, may reverse the trend towards early retirement.
One recommendation that has been made is that there should be a ‘decade of retirement’, between the ages of 60 and 70.
Sources of Income
Social security benefits provide the main source of elderly people's income, followed by a pension from a former employer (Figure 8).
Occupational pensions represented 16% of pensioners gross income in 1979, and 21% in 1987, reflecting the growth in coverage of occupational pensions.
Their importance is expected to increase as higher percentages of those approaching retirement age are members of occupational pension schemes.
In 1988, 74% of men 55 and over, and 76% of those 45–54, were members of their current employer's pension scheme.
The figure for women is lower: 63% and 69%, respectively (General Household Survey 1988).
Not all employers have equal access to occupational pensions, and manual workers are less likely to receive one on retirement or on the same level as non-manual and professional employees.
The contribution of paid employment to pensioners income has diminished due to the trend to early retirement.
Standard of Living
A significant number of elderly people have a low standard of living.
Over one and a half million pensioners (15%), claimed the means tested top up Income Support in 1989–90, and it is estimated that a further 0.9 million were eligible, but did not claim.
An additional 1.7 million pensioners received help with their rent or rates.
According to the House of Commons Social Security Committee Report — Low Income Statistics: Households Below Average Income, Tables 1988–23% of the poorest tenth of the population are pensioners.
The old elderly, 75+, are generally poorer than the young elderly as they retired when earnings were lower, and therefore had less savings, and lower or no occupational pensions.
In 1989 the average weekly net disposable income of a single retired person, mainly dependent on state pension, was £58.54, and for a retired couple, £100.74.
This was 23% and 40%, respectively, of the average weekly disposable income of all households (Family Expenditure Survey 1989).
In April 1991 the weekly basic state pension for a single person was £52.00, and for a married couple £83.25.
The state pension is increased annually in line with the retail price index.
Prior to 1980, the state pension was also linked to the average rise in earnings, whichever was the higher, and if this link had been maintained, single pensioners and married couples would be receiving an extra £12.80 and £20.50, respectively.

Young People: growing up in the Welfare State
The circumstances in which young people grow up have altered drastically in the past few decades.
This paper examines these changes and policy responses to them, with a special section on social security.
In some respects, young people have gained greater autonomy and are expected to shoulder adult responsibilities at ever younger ages.
But other changes, especially economic ones, have tended to increase their dependence on their families.

FACT SHEET 3
numbers and trends
There are just over a million one-parent families — one in seven of all families with dependent children.
More than a million and a half children — one in eight — live in these one-parent families.
In many ways the term ‘one-parent family’ is a misleading shorthand for a variety of situations; from that of a never married mother of 19, to that of a widowed mother of 55.
The General Household Survey (GHS) defines a one-parent family as ‘one parent with their never married dependent children’; they may be widowed, divorced, separated or single never-married women (from now referred to as ‘single mothers’).
This definition excludes those mothers who are cohabiting, and married mothers whose husbands are temporarily not living in the household.
However, most children have two living parents and it is the rights and obligations of both parents that are at the heart of much of the current debate — particularly that surrounding divorce and the associated issues of maintenance, custody and access.
Numbers and trends
In 1986, the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), estimated that there were just over a million (1,010 thousand) one parent families in Great Britain caring for more than a million and a half (1.6 million children).
(J Haskey, 1989)
The number of one-parent families has grown in the past two decades increasing by almost 80 per cent between 1971 — when there were just over half a million one parent families — and 1986 when there were just over a million.
A background paper to the social security review estimated that the number of one parent families would be between a million and 1.5 million by 2005/6.
(Reform of Social Security Background Paper Volume 3, Cmnd 9519, 1985)
More families are headed by lone parents
Table 1 shows that one-parent families are an increasing proportion of all families with dependent children.
The proportion of all families headed by a lone parent has increased from 8 per cent in 1971 to 16 per cent in 1988.
While the proportion of all families headed by a lone father hardly changed, the proportion headed by a lone mother doubled.
Nine out of ten lone parents are women
Two thirds of lone mothers are divorced or separated
By 1986, 4 our of 10 one parent families were headed by divorced mothers.
Single mothers and separated  mothers were the next largest groups at around 20 per cent each and widows and lone fathers (of whom two thirds are divorced or separated and almost a quarter widows) are the smallest groups.
Table 2 shows the number of these different parent families between 1971 and 1986.
Age of lone parents
Single mothers tend to be younger than other lone parents — one half are under 25 — and widowed mothers tend to be older — more than a half are over 45.
A quarter of lone fathers are over 50, reflecting their greater likelihood of being widowers.
Marriage breakdown accounts for three fifths of increase in one parent families
Between 1976 and 1986 the total number of one parent families increased by 35 per cent.
A part of this change was a fall in the number of widowed mothers.
Among the groups that have increased, the largest single cause of the increase was divorce, 60 per cent; an increase in the numbers of single mothers accounted for a further 34 per cent , lone fathers just over 3 per cent and separated women just under 2 per cent .
What accounts for the changes?
One parent families are not a static group and just as certain circumstances bring them into existence, so with others they may disappear.
One parent families may come about because of death, divorce or separation in a two parent family or the ending of cohabitation or when a single woman has a baby on her own.
Similarly, a one parent family may become a two parent family through marriage or remarriage, reconciliation or cohabitation.
They also dissolve when children become independent or their parent dies.
Tentative estimates suggest that the average duration of lone parenthood could be between three and five years.
(Millar, 1989).
Divorced and never mothers show largest increase in past decade
Between 1976 and 1986 when the total number of one parent families increased by 35 per cent, families headed by women increased more than families headed by men — almost 40 per cent compared to just over 10 per cent .
Among the families headed by women, some groups grew more than others.
the group which increased the most between 1976 and 1986 was of divorced mothers — almost 80 per cent in the decade.
The divorce rate rose fairly steadily over the decade apart from a notable, but not entirely sustained, increase after the liberalising of the laws in 1984.
In addition, the rate of remarriage among divorced women has fallen.
single mothers increased almost as much over this period — by 77 per cent.
This is due in part to an increase in the proportion of births outside marriage and of mothers who bring up these children themselves as well as to less pressure on young women and men to ‘legitimise’ a conception with a ‘shot-gun wedding’.
one parent families headed by fathers also grew over this period, by 11 per cent.
there was much less change for separated mothers who grew by 3.0 per cent.
in contrast, the number of widowed mothers with dependent children fell by 30 per cent.
Changing mortality and fertility patterns are likely to have contributed to this fall.
Children
In 1986 there were estimated to be 1.6 million children living in one parent families — one in eight of all dependent children.
The proportion of dependent children living in one parent families has increased by more than 50 per cent since the early 1970s.
One parent families tend to be slightly smaller than two parent families with an average of just under two children, compared to just over two children per family.
In common with families in general, one parent families have been getting smaller.
Estimates suggest that between a fifth and a quarter of children may spend some time in a one-parent family.
(J Haskey 1986, L Clarke 1989, J Millar 1989)
Area variation
The highest proportions of one parent families in Great Britain occur in the inner London Boroughs.
While the 1981 Census put the proportion of all families that are one parent families at just over 14 per cent, the average in Inner London was 26.6 per cent .
The highest rate was in Lambeth where 32 per cent of all families were one parent families, followed by Hackney with 31 per cent.
(NCOPF, Information No. 35, September 1985).

Financial Circumstances
Nearly two thirds of one-parent families live in poverty
In 1985 some two-thirds (63 per cent) of one-parent families (with nearly a million children) were living in poverty — that is they were either receiving supplementary benefit (now income support) or had incomes below the supplementary benefit (sb) level.
This compared with 10 per cent of two parent families with dependent children.
The proportion of one-parent families living in poverty has increased since 1979 when 4 in 10 (42 per cent) were either receiving sb or had incomes below the sb level.
Families whose incomes are not more than 40 per cent above the sb level are often considered to be ‘living on the margins of poverty’; in 1985, seven in ten of all one parent families had incomes below this level compared with two out of ten two parent families.
The proportion of one parent families living ‘on the margins of poverty’ has increased since 1979 when a half of all one parent families had incomes below 140 per cent of sb.
More up-to-date figures are expected soon.
Sources of Income
Although many lone parents work, Table 4 shows that earnings from employment are less likely to be their main source of income than they are for two parent families although for both groups this will be affected by fluctuations in employment and unemployment.
Figures for earlier years also showed that earnings area more likely to be the main source of income for lone fathers than lone mothers.
Social security is the main source of income for two thirds of lone parent families, and one in eight two-parent families (see Table 4).
However, the incomes of many lone parents are made up from more than one of these sources.
For example, maintenance payments and child and one parent benefit can be added on to any earnings from employment to increase lone parents' incomes.
Conversely, they are all deducted from income support and housing benefit and maintenance are taken into account in calculating entitlement to family credit.
Social security benefits for lone parents.
The most common social security benefits for lone parents are:
Income Support , means-tested income assistance for those not working or working less than 24 hours a week; 727 thousand lone families were receiving Income Support in May 1988.
(Social Security Statistics, 1989).
One parent benefit , a weekly addition to child benefit for one parent families;; 696 thousand lone families were receiving one parent benefit in January 1990.
(House of Commons, 5/2/90, col 523)
Family Credit , for families with children who are low paid and working at least 24 hours a week; 120 thousand lone parent families were receiving Family Credit in September 1989.
(House of Commons, 5/2/90, col 523).
Widowed mother's allowance , a contributory National Insurance benefit for widows with dependent children; 560 thousand widowed mothers were receiving widowed mother's allowance in 1988.
(Social Security Statistics, 1989).
Housing benefit , means-tested assistance with rent, rates and poll tax; 650 thousand lone parents were receiving housing benefit in May 1988.
(House of Commons, 5/2/90, col 523)
The proportion of one parent families dependent on supplementary benefit/income support has been increasing faster than the increase in the number of one parent families.
While 4 in 10 one parent families received supplementary benefit during the 1970s, this was 6 in 10 in 1986.
Estimates suggest that the proportion is similar today.
Two thirds of lone parents on benefit receive income support.
Of those lone parents on income support, two thirds are divorced or separated and have at least one child under five years old.
(The Government's Expenditure Plans 1990–91 to 1992–93, Chapter 14 — Department of Social Security, CM 1014, 1990)
Employment and earnings
Four out of ten lone mothers work
The figures in Table 5 show that in 1985–87:
lone mothers were less likely to work than married mothers 42 per cent compared with 54 per cent;
about the same proportion of each group worked full-time (18 per cent of lone mothers and 17 per cent of married mothers);
fewer lone mothers worked part-time, about a quarter, compared with more than a third of married mothers.
Employment among lone mothers (now 42 per cent) has fallen from a peak of 49 per cent in 1979–81 although it is now higher than the low of 39 per cent in 1983–85.
Both lone parents and married mothers are more likely to work once their children have reached school age — 55 per cent and 68 per cent respectively; compared to 20 per cent of lone mothers and 34 per cent of married mothers with pre-school age children.
The opportunities for lone mothers to work will be influenced in particular by the availability of child care, opportunities in the labour market and the interaction of earnings, taxes and benefits.
Lone parents can earn up to £15 a week before their income support is reduced.
In 1988, 67 thousand lone parents receiving Income Support had earnings from employment.
(Social Security Statistics 1989, Table 37.31)
In 1986, 440 thousand lone parents were estimated to be in paid work including those receiving sb with part-time earnings.
(House of Commons Hansard, 24/7/89, col 564)
The evidence suggests that lone fathers are more likely to work than lone mothers; indeed their working hours are similar to those of fathers in two parent families.
One reason may be that they are less concentrated in low paid jobs than women.
In April 1989, 108 thousand single parent families were receiving Family Credit as a supplement to their earnings.
All but four thousand were headed by women.
More than half of those receiving Family Credit had their occupations classified as catering, cleaning, hairdressing and other personal services, clerical and selling.
(Social Security Statistics, 1989, Table 33.05)
Maintenance
There is little information about maintenance and there are no national statistics.
It is rarely a main source of income (for 4 per cent of lone parents in 1987), the amounts awarded are generally low, they are mostly for children rather than spouses and payments are frequently unreliable.
In 1982–83, 40 per cent of divorced women (who had not remarried) were receiving some maintenance; 23 per cent received it for their children only, 12 per cent for their children and themselves and 3 per cent for themselves only.
(Social Trends 1985, p 40).
Those on income support do not gain financially from maintenance as the amount of the payments is deducted from their benefit.
In 1988, 167,000 lone parents on income support were receiving maintenance, just under a quarter of all lone parents on income support (National Audit Office, ‘Department of Social Security Support for Lone Parent Families’, HMSO, 1990).
There are a number of reasons why lone parents may not receive maintenance including the unwillingness or inability of liable relatives to pay maintenance, perhaps because of unemployment or the formation of second families.

Social Circumstances
Housing
7 out of 10 lone mothers live in rented accommodation
One parent families are more likely than other families with children to live in poor physical conditions; to have fewer amenities; to be overcrowded and to live in unpopular areas, especially the inner cities.
Over one in eight (12%) of all lone mothers are living with their own parents.
More than a third of single mothers are in this position.
While this may be a means of sharing responsibilities and caring, it may also give rise to tensions in overcrowded households.
A significant minority of one parent families is also concentrated in the privately rented sector which includes some of the oldest housing stock with the poorest amenities.
Most lone parents live in rented accommodation and most of this is local authority owned:
93 per cent of single mothers live in rented accommodation — 80 per cent in local authority housing;
widowed mothers and lone fathers are more likely than other lone parents either to own outright or still be buying their homes.
Table 6 Families and Housing: Tenure of families with dependent children
Lone parents are particularly at risk of homelessness
‘Lone parent families with young children are particularly at risk of becoming homeless.
Their representation (at 40%) among homeless acceptances by local authorities is ten times as great as the proportion they form of the community (4% in 1987).
At current levels this means over 50,000 one-parent households in a year.
This very high degree of risk has been maintained for a long time as many studies over the past thirty years have shown.
The high proportion of one-parent families among the homeless should not be construed as confirmation of the allegations by government Ministers that young girls deliberately become pregnant in order to jump the housing queue.
No evidence has been produced to substantiate such allegations.
On the contrary, reports published by the Department of the Environment itself show that:
a majority of lone parents with young children, who become homeless, have experienced the breakdown of a marriage or other partnership;
about a half of them have previously had a permanent home of their own either as tenants or, for a growing number, as housebuyers;
the average age of lone parents in accommodation for the homeless is in the mid-to-late twenties and a very small percentage are unmarried teenage girls.
These findings corroborate other studies as well as date collected by agencies in the course of dealing with homeless people.’
Source: John Greve, ‘Homelessness in Britain’, Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust, 1990.
Consumer durables
Lone parent families are less likely than two parent families to have household consumer durables.
A comparison of adult and child households (which is not strictly comparable with lone parent families) from the Family Expenditure Survey showed that this is true to a certain extent for central heating, washing machines, fridges and televisions.
The difference is particularly marked for cars and telephones; more than 8 out of 10 two adult households with children have a car or a van compared to only 3 in 10 on adult households with children and whereas 9 in 10 of the two adult households with children have a telephone, this is true for only 6 in 10 of the one adult and children households
Childcare provision
The provision of childcare is one of the most important issues in the area of support for working lone parents and those who wish to work.
The figures in Table 7 suggest that there is not a great deal of difference in the use of educational facilities by one and two parent families; lone parents make more use of day nurseries and two parents of play groups.
Table 7 Education and childcare for children under five, 1986*
However, there are other very important sources of childcare for one parent families.
An earlier GHS survey found that 10 per cent of the care provided for children in one parent families was provided by another member of their households and a further 10 per cent by a relative outside the household.
(GHS 1979, T6.12).
The ‘relative’ is frequently the maternal grandmother.
Europe
Comparisons between countries are hampered by differences in national definition.
Nonetheless, statistics have been produced by the FPSC for the countries in the European Community and a tentative ‘league’ table of one parent families produced.
The report also found that the overwhelming majority of lone parents are women, most of whom are divorced or separated; single mothers are the smallest group of lone parents.
Lone parents generally have fewer children than two parent families and they are usually older.
Lone parents themselves are likely to be over 25 years of age — on average less than 10 per cent were younger.
While the relative share of employment and social security benefits varied enormously from one country to another as sources of income for lone parents, maintenance payments generally contributed little to the income of lone parents, even if widows are excluded.
While Britain may appear at the top of the European Community lone parent league table, other countries, both in and outside Europe, have as high or higher rates.
For example, around 20 per cent in Hungary (1984), 14 per cent in Australia (1985); 17 per cent in Canada (1981) and 26 per cent in the US (1984).
(J Millar, 1989) Moreover, the growth in the numbers of one-parent families in the past two decades has occurred in most industrialised countries.
(J Haskey 1989)
Table 8 Lone parent families as a proportion of all families with children.
One parent family portraits
Single mothers
Almost one in four lone parents are single mothers.
They are generally younger, on average 25 years and with fewer (an average of 1.3) and younger (6 in 10 are under 5 years) children.
They are likely to be claiming income support.
As many as 1 in 10 may live with their parents while most of those with their own accommodation will be renting from the local authority.
Widowed mothers
Less than ten per cent of lone parents are widowed mothers.
They are generally older, on average 47 years and with relatively small families (1.4 children).
Three quarters of these dependent children are over 10 years old.
About 1 in 10 claim income support.
A half own their own homes (or are still buying them) with the remainder renting mostly from local authorities.
Divorced and separated mothers
The characteristics of divorced and separated mothers are very similar.
They are likely to be in their mid-30s with relatively larger families (just under 2 children).
About three quarters of their children will be between 5 and 15 years.
About 4 in 10 divorced families will be claiming income support.
About a third are buying their own homes (some owning them outright) and two thirds are renting.
Lone fathers
About ten per cent of one parent families are headed by men.
They are likely to be older, in their mid 40s with relatively small families (1.4 children on average).
Two thirds of their children will be between 10 and 15 years.
About one third will be claiming income support, a half own or are buying their own homes and a half renting.

FACT SHEET 4
How are the living standards of families determined?
This fact sheet examines sources and types of income, and the variation between different types of families.
It looks at women's contribution to family income, and examines pensioner's incomes, low income families, the costs of children, at how families divide their income, and at patterns of family spending.
Sources of income
A majority of families with children have earnings from employment as their main source of income.
In 1988, 66% of total family income came from wages and salaries, 14% from social security benefits, and 20% from other sources, such as investment.
Households on low incomes are more likely to depend upon Social Security Benefits.
In 1989, 80% of the income of households with weekly incomes of below £45 came from state benefits, with 2% from wages and salaries.
For households receiving between £525 and £650 per week, 77% came from wages and salaries, and 2% from benefits.
Households without earnings from employment are also more likely to be on lower incomes.
The gross average weekly income of unemployed households is half that of employed households (Family Expenditure Survey 1988, HMSO 1990).
Lone Parents
Lone parent families are more likely than two parent families to depend on social security benefits, and are less likely to have earnings from employment as their main source of income.
Two thirds of lone parent families depend mainly on social security benefits, compared with one in eight two parent families.
Women
Women form 43% of the labour force, and women's incomes from employment are a major part of most family incomes.
Women are less likely to be in paid employment than men.
There are differences for women depending on marital status and the greater share of responsibility many women take for the care of children.
According to the General Household Survey, in Great Britain in 1988, 89% of men aged 16–64 were economically active, compared with 72% of non-married women and 69% of married women aged between 16 and 59.
Many families now have ‘dual earners’, couples with children where both partners are in work.
In 1988, 62% of married couples of working age were both in work.
Married couples with dependent children are slightly less likely to both work (58%).
The number and age of children in a family are important factors influencing the employment, and so income, patterns of families.
Couples with young children are less likely to both work, as are couples with three or more children (General Household Survey 1988, HMSO 1990).
Women with younger children are in general less likely to work than those with older children, although about one third of mothers with a child under three do work.
As children get older women are more likely to work, in the main part-time.
Various types of part-time work, job sharing and other flexible arrangements are becoming available to women and to a lesser extent, to men.
Lone Mothers
Lone mothers are less likely to work than married mothers.
Where children are aged under 5 years, 20% of lone mothers worked full or part-time in 1986/88, compared to 37% of married mothers.
51% of lone mothers with children aged 5 years or over were working compared with 70% of married mothers.
For more information see Fact Sheet 3:Lone Parent Families 
Demographic pressures mean that more women are likely to take up paid employment in the future.
By 2001 the government expects 90% of new jobs to be filled by women and that women will form 45% of the labour force (Employment Gazette April 1990).
Women's earnings remain, on average, lower than men's.
In 1988, the average gross weekly pay for full-time work was £246 for men, and £164 for women.
Women's incomes are a major contribution to family incomes.
In 1989, the average weekly income (from all sources) of dual earner married couple households with children, was nearly one half (45%) higher than couples with children with the women not in employment (£461 compared to £320).
Amongst dual-earner married couples with children, women's earnings contributed 25% of family income from employment (Family Expenditure Survey 1989).
Evidence for 1989 found that just 7% of married women earned the same as or more than their husbands (Women and Employment: a lifetime perspective OPCS/HMSO 1984).
Fewer than one in one hundred families with dependent children with a mother in employment have weekly incomes under £100, compared to one in ten families with dependent children where the mother was not in employment.
At the other end of income distribution, 47% of families with children with an employed mother received £425 or more per week, compared to 21% of families where the mother was not in work (Family Expenditure Survey 1989).
Pensioner's incomes
It is important to consider the incomes of people over pension age.
Firstly, their income is less likely than the rest of the population to come from earnings from employment; and more likely to be derived from pensions from the state or from past employers or from savings.
Secondly, this group is set to increase both in number and as a proportion of the population in future years.
Pensioners have benefited in recent years from rising real living standards.
Over the period 1979–1987, the average total net income of this group rose by 31%.
The changes in the composition of income over this period are shown in the Table.
The contribution to income from savings and occupational pensions has increased, as to a much lesser extent has income from state pensions and other benefits.
Earnings from employment have decreased.
Table 4 Pensioner's Income 1979 to 1987
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies  suggests that the proportion of income contributed by the basic state pension is likely to decline in future years because of the decision to link benefit rates to prices rather than wages.
It is also likely that because of past changes a growing number of women will retire with some entitlement to a state pension.
The contribution made by occupational pensions is expected to continue to grow.
Pensioner's incomes are not, of course, evenly distributed and important inequalities exist.
Occupational pensions are more likely to contribute to the incomes of ‘better off’ pensioners.
Significant numbers of pensioners exist on low incomes.
The level of the basic state pension is close to the level of Income Support, and pensioners with no other source of income than the state pension are also likely to be in receipt of means-tested benefits.
In 1988/89, 16% of all pensioners were in receipt of Income Support.
In 1987, 2.2 million people over pension age are estimated to have had incomes below the level of Income Support .
Pension ages differ for men and women, and this can affect income in retirement.
When the State pension age was introduced, men and women could both draw a pension from age 65, but in 1940 the pension age for women was lowered to 60.
At that time women were generally regarded as economically dependent on their husbands and less in need of an independent source of income in retirement.
As a consequence women could until 1975 opt to pay a lower rate of national insurance and receive a lower retirement pension.
The position of women has changed, and now more women work and want to earn a pension in their own right.
Rulings made by the European Court of Justice now mean that pension schemes run by employers should not discriminate between men and women on grounds of age, but it is not yet clear what the consequences of these rulings will be.
The government is to review the state pension age, but there is no one solution that is obviously favoured.
Many people wish to stop working as soon as they reach pension age.
A large number wish to continue working as long as they are fit and do not want to retire at the state pension age.
For these people, a fixed pension age, even if equal at 63, 60 or 65, would not necessarily be suitable.
Another possibility is the introduction of more ‘flexibility’ so that a person could retire between certain ages and draw a reduced pension.
For the Government, cost is a prime consideration.
The state retirement pension is the largest single social security benefit, as well as the oldest.
First introduced in 1909, the basic pension in 1991–92 will cost £24,407 million.

Table 2 Employment patterns of women with children
Table 3 Employment of lone mothers and married mothers with dependent children
Low income families
A family may have a low income in work because of low pay, or out of work from social security benefits.
One way of measuring the extent of low income, or poverty, is to use numbers receiving supplementary benefit, now income support, as an indication.
Table 5 Low income families with children
The basic Income Support rate, including allowances for two people, their dependent children and the family or lone parent premium, from April 1991 are as follows: for a couple with two children under 11 is £97.30 per week, and for a lone parent over 18 with one child under 11 £63.05 per week.
It is important to note that the use of benefit levels as a measure of poverty has been criticised, by academics as well as by Government.
A rise in the level of benefits relative to average income will result in a rise in the numbers on ‘low incomes’.
The Government does not accept the concept of a ‘poverty line’.
Instead, the government has decided to produce figures which measure low income against average income.
Counter criticisms have argued that income support levels are the best available measure of a minimum acceptable income.
The table shows the composition of the bottom 10 per cent of the income distribution according to type of family.
The figures give the mid-point of the distribution and are before housing costs are taken into account.
The table above is taken from a Social Security Select Committee report which produced figures for 1988 that the Government had decided not to produce itself.
Using the same analysis as Government statisticians, the figures show that over the period 1979 to 1988, real disposable incomes rose by over 30 per cent.
Increases were higher for those on higher incomes, but those on low incomes also received more income.
The income of the poorest fifth of the population rose by 11 per cent‘in real terms’(after allowing for inflation).
Within this group however, families headed by a full-time worker saw average income rises of 21 per cent, yet those families with an unemployed head were slightly worse off in 1988 than in 1981.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has made a comparison of some different surveys of the extent of poverty, all of which use the same source, the Government's Family Expenditure Survey, yet produce different results because of methodology.
There are many factors that must be taken into account, and it is often the use of different survey methodology that can cause politicians and others to disagree over particular surveys that claim to show growing poverty or increased prosperity.
Income has to be defined.
(See Types of Income) Choices have to be made about what counts as income, and then further decisions are required to determine whether to sue gross income or disposable income, income before or after housing costs, and whether the average used is an arithmetic mean or a ‘median’ or mid-point in the distribution.
Expenditure may be used instead of income, but again can produce different results.
Changing patterns of household formation are normally taken into account, as this factor can also affect results.
For example, if household size falls during a period under examination, the study might conclude that living standards had also fallen.
But if the average size of a household has fallen at the same time (this has happened in the UK) then the income of each person in a household may have risen.
The method used to adjust for changes in household size and composition, known as an ‘equivalence scale’, can affect results.
The difference in results can be very large indeed.
For example, IFS estimate that if the Department of Social Security had used the European Commission methodology, which uses expenditure rather than income, then in 1985 an extra 3.4 million people would have been found below half the national average.
Similarly, if the DSS had used the European equivalence scales, a further 1.3 million people would have appeared below the poverty line.
Finally, it is important to remember the geographical scope of any survey.
For example, the survey now in use by the Government excludes Northern Ireland.
Credit and Debt
Credit has grown in importance as a method of finance.
Families with two or more children are more likely than those with one child or people without children to make use of credit.
Credit may be linked with building and keeping a family.
Surveys of families receiving supplementary benefit  have show that couples with children and lone parents are likely to have higher weekly credit commitments than people with no children or pensioners.
Debt may arise when credit cannot be repaid.
An estimated 2 million households in 1987 could not meet their repayment commitments.
Families with children are much more likely to get into debt than people without children, and there is a greater risk to larger families.
Families on supplementary benefit, now income support, are likely to borrow to buy items of clothing or durable household goods.
Calculations have shown that a two child family receiving supplementary benefit could buy a woman's coat only once every 15 years.
A fridge would need to last 15 years, and an iron for 12.
Table 6 Individuals in the bottom 10% of the income distribution
Types of income
The ‘Social Division of Welfare’
In 1958 Professor Richard Titmuss argued that social services included more than Welfare State services such as education, social security or the NHS.
Society met needs and served interests through not one but three categories of welfare:
Social Welfare : the system of state social services providing for example education, medical care, social security benefits.
Fiscal Welfare : the tax system which adjusts the level of income on which tax is payable through reliefs and allowances.
In doing so assumptions are made about family relationships and dependency.
Occupational Welfare : benefits in cash or in kind such as expenses or company cars, that raise real income but are not always taxed.
Social welfare
According to government, some of the main needs to be met by the social security system are bringing up children, and caring for elderly or disabled people.
One of the factors cited by government as important in determining the structure of benefits is ‘the effect on family stability’.
In 1989/90, a total of £9,200 million was spent on social security benefits for families.
This represents 18% of total social security spending.
Child Benefit is the only benefit that carries automatic entitlement, and this accounts for the virtual 100% take-up of this benefit.
Family Credit is claimed by about 50% of those entitled to it.
One Parent Benefit is paid to 75% of lone parents.
Occupational welfare
Although often known as ‘fringe benefits’, non-monetary additions to earnings can often represent a considerable part of the financial rewards of employment.
Occupational welfare may include tangible benefits such as non-contributory pensions, company cars or cheap loans, but may also refer to less tangible aspects of employment like the number and range of hours worked, the working environment and effects on health or future prospects.
Occupational Welfare is not evenly distributed, and does not cover the whole workforce.
In general as the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth noted in 1980, ‘the more you earn the more you get on top of pay’.
Tax is not necessarily paid on fringe benefits, indeed many qualify for tax relief.
Income tax relief for 1989/90 on employee and employer contributions to occupational pension schemes is estimated by the government at £4.9 million.
Changes to pensions now mean that more people have ‘opted out’ of the State earnings related pension scheme, and taken out personal pensions.
The estimated cost of relief towards personal pensions is £800 million for 1989/90.
From April 1990 a workplace nursery is no longer regarded as a ‘benefit in kind’, and is not counted in the assessment of income tax.
Figures for 1983/84 from Inland Revenue show that 1.4 million UK employees receive fringe benefits liable to tax.
6% of employees, including directors, have a company care, and 4% private medical insurance.
The ‘taxable value’(which may understate the real value) of benefits rises with income.
Employees earning between £8 500 and £15 000 received benefits worth around £380, those earning over £50 000 received £3 375.
(Social Trends 1987).
Fiscal welfare
The amount of occupational welfare is small in comparison with the fiscal welfare provided through the tax system.
The system incorporates many assumptions about family relationships and dependency.
Allowances such as the Married Man's, Single Person's and Wife's Earned Income all reflected judgements about different family responsibilities and income requirements, The estimated cost in 1989/90 of these allowances was £26.7 million, but since April 1990 they have been replaced by Independent Taxation (see below).
Other allowances include the ‘additional personal allowance’ granted to single parents to raise their allowance to the level of a married man.
Child tax allowances which were the main tax recognition of the extra costs of children, were phased out following the introduction of child benefit in 1977.
In April 1990 a new system of Independent Taxation was introduced, following longstanding criticism of the assumption that a woman's income should be regarded as part of her husband's for tax purposes.
The allowances referred to above have now been replaced with a personal allowance for all adults, plus a married couple's allowance, which is payable to the husband in most cases.
Cohabiting couples are not eligible for Married Couple's Allowance, and for tax purposes are regarded as two single people.
Table 7 Spending on and receipt of social security benefits
Family Spending
Spending varies considerably between households.
The highest spending is amongst families with more members in paid employment, and lowest amongst pensioner families.
Families with children spend proportionally less per person than families without children.
Spending also varies according to whether married women work outside the home.
In 1988, the average weekly spending for married couple households with children where the woman was not in paid employment was £230 per household, compared to £295 for similar households where the woman was in work.
The same pattern exists for households without children.
Poorer households are known to spend a larger proportion of their income on essentials such as food and fuel for heating.
Spending varies according to the region in which a family lives.
In general the highest spending families live in London and the South East, and the lowest spenders live in the North.
Income and Spending within the family
Social policies often assume that the income and expenditure of a household is divided equally amongst members of the household, in particular between husband and wife.
The idea of the male breadwinner providing for his wife and family is now less readily accepted, and research exists to show that incomes are unequally distributed within families.
The position of young people within families is also important.
Studies have found various ways a husband's income is used by the family.
One of the most common methods is pooling.
Both partners put money into a common pool, and both may spend this money.
Each partner may also be responsible for other spending.
Other couples use an allowance system, usually given by a husband to his wife as ‘housekeeping’ money.
Women in paid employment are more likely to have an independent income.
Wives often do not know how much their husbands earn.
Research by the Family Policy Studies Centre has examined the relationships between government policies and the family unit, with particular reference to the social security system.
Policy often operates with a view of the family that takes insufficient account of demographic and social change:
‘At the heart of many current discussions about the family lies a model with which present ways of life are contrasted.
This consists of a married couple living together with their dependent child(ren).
It is often envisaged in a ‘nuclear’ household, that is, separate from other relatives, with the man as breadwinner and the woman as housewife and childrearer.
But it is the institution of marriage which is central to the model.’
The married family is, however, not the only kind of family in existence, and difficulties can arise when policies are based upon one image of the family to the exclusion of other types of family or living arrangement.
Jo Roll examines particular social security benefits which make assumptions about the sharing of resources between family members.
Meanstested benefit payments are calculated by adding together the needs and resources of a family.
Housing Benefit can be reduced where there are other people in a household, because of an assumption that some resources will be shared.
Relatives of people living in care homes can be expected to make up the difference between the amount of benefit and the charges actually levied  by by the home.
Social security policy towards couples living together outside marriage, and other people sharing  accomodation , embodies assumptions about the sharing of resources and about living costs, and about the nature of the relationship.
As a result part of the administration of some benefits can involve an investigation of a relationship between people sharing  accomodation .
The Cost of Children
Children can represent an expensive proposition for families.
Social policy has traditionally recognised the additional costs incurred by families with children through the tax and social security systems, although whether or not this has occurred in practice is the subject of dispute.
The costs of children may be divided into direct costs — the outlay on the baby and mother around the time of birth, and indirect costs — the amounts foregone by mothers who take time out of paid employment, and who may return to work part-time and at lower rates of pay.
Estimates of these costs put the average direct costs of a baby for the first year at at least £1 500, running to £30 000 by the time the child reaches 16.
The indirect costs of two children over the mother's lifetime are calculated at £135 000.
