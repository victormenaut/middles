CHAPTER ONE
These things are there.
The garden and the tree
The serpent at its root, the fruit of gold
The woman in the shadow of the boughs
The running water and the grassy space.
They are and were there.
At the old world's rim,
In the Hesperidean grove, the fruit
Glowed golden on eternal boughs, and there
The dragon Ladon crisped his jewelled crest
Scraped a gold claw and sharped a silver tooth
And dozed and waited through eternity
Until the tricksy hero Herakles
Came to his dispossession and the theft.
Randolph Henry Ash, from The Garden of Proserpina , 1861
The book was thick and black and covered with dust.
Its boards were bowed and creaking; it had been maltreated in its own time.
Its spine was missing, or rather protruded from amongst the leaves like a bulky marker.
It was bandaged about and about with dirty white tape, tied in a neat bow.
The librarian handed it to Roland Michell, who was sitting waiting for it in the Reading Room of the London Library.
It had been exhumed from Locked Safe no. 5 where it usually stood between Pranks of Priapus and The Grecian Way of Love .
It was ten in the morning, one day in September 1986.
Roland had the small single table he liked best, behind a square pillar, with the clock over the fireplace nevertheless in full view.
To his right was a high sunny window, through which you could see the high green leaves of St James's Square.
The London Library was Roland's favourite place.
It was shabby but civilised, alive with history but inhabited also by living poets and thinkers who could be found squatting on the slotted metal floors of the stacks, or arguing pleasantly at the turning of the stair.
Here Carlyle had come, here George Eliot had progressed through the bookshelves.
Roland saw her black silk skirts, her velvet trains, sweeping compressed between the Fathers of the Church, and heard her firm foot ring on metal among the German poets.
Here Randolph Henry Ash had come, cramming his elastic mind and memory with unconsidered trifles from History and Topography, from the felicitous alphabetical conjunctions of Science and Miscellaneous — Dancing, Deaf and Dumb, Death, Dentistry, Devil and Demonology, Distribution, Dogs, Domestic Servants, Dreams.
In his day, works on Evolution had been catalogued under Pre-Adamite Man.
Roland had only recently discovered that the London Library possessed Ash s own copy of Vico's Principj di Scienza Nuova .
Ash's books were most regrettably scattered across Europe and America.
By far the largest single gathering was of course in the Stant Collection at Robert Dale Owen University in New Mexico, where Mortimer Cropper worked on his monumental edition of the Complete Correspondence of Randolph Henry Ash .
That was no problem nowadays, books travelled the aether like light and sound.
But it was just possible that Ash's own Vico had marginalia missed even by the indefatigable Cropper.
And Roland was looking for sources for Ash's Garden of Proserpina .
And there was a pleasure to be had from reading the sentences Ash had read, touched with his fingers, scanned with his eyes.
It was immediately clear that the book had been undisturbed for a very long time, perhaps even since it had been laid to rest.
The librarian fetched a checked duster, and wiped away the dust, a black, thick, tenacious Victorian dust, a dust composed of smoke and fog particles accumulated before the Clean Air Acts.
Roland undid the bindings.
The book sprang apart, like a box, disgorging leaf after leaf of faded paper, blue, cream, grey, covered with rusty writing, the brown scratches of a steel nib.
Roland recognised the handwriting with a shock of excitement.
They appeared to be notes on Vico, written on the backs of book-bills and letters.
The librarian observed that it didn't look as though they had been touched before.
Their edges, beyond the pages, were dyed soot-black, giving the impression of the borders of mourning cards.
They coincided precisely with their present positions, edge of page and edge of stain.
Roland asked if it was in order for him to study these jottings.
He gave his credentials; he was part-time research assistant to Professor Blackadder, who had been editing Ash's Complete Works since 1951.
The librarian tiptoed away to telephone: whilst he was gone, the dead leaves continued a kind of rustling and shifting, enlivened by their release.
Ash had put them there.
The librarian came back and said ‘yes’, it was quite in order, as long as Roland was very careful not to disturb the sequence of the interleaved fragments until they had been listed and described.
The Librarian would be glad to know of any important discoveries Mr Michell might make.
All this was over by 10:30.
For the next half-hour Roland worked haphazardly, moving backwards and forwards in the Vico, half-looking for Proserpina, half-reading Ash's notes, which was not easy, since they were written in various languages, in Ash's annotating hand, which was reduced to a minute near-printing, not immediately identifiable as the same as his more generous poetic or letter-writing hand.
At 11.00 he found what he thought was the relevant passage in Vico.
Vico had looked for historical fact in the poetic metaphors of myth and legend; this piecing together was his ‘new science’.
His Proserpine was the corn, the origin of commerce and community.
Randolph Henry Ash's Proserpine had been seen as a Victorian reflection of religious doubt, a meditation on the myths of Resurrection.
Lord Leighton had painted her, distraught and floating, a golden figure in a tunnel of darkness.
Blackadder had a belief that she represented, for Randolph Ash, a personification of History itself in its early mythical days.
(Ash had also written a poem about Gibbon and one about the Venerable Bede, historians of greatly differing kinds.
Blackadder had written an article on R. H. Ash and relative historiography.)
Roland compared Ash's text with the translation, and copied parts onto an index card.
He had two boxes of these, tomato-red and an intense grassy green, with springy plastic hinges that popped in the library silence.
‘Ears of grain were called apples of gold, which must have been the first gold in the world while metallic gold was unknown…
So the golden apple which Hercules first brought back or gathered, from Hesperia must have been grain; and the Gallic Hercules with links of this gold, that issue from his mouth, chains men by the ears: something which will later be discovered as a myth concerning the fields.
Hence Hercules remained the Deity to propitiate in order to find treasures, whose god was Dis (identical with Pluto) who carries off Proserpine (another name for Ceres or grain) to the underworld described by the poets, according to whom its first name was Styx, its second the land of the dead, its third the depth of furrows…
It was of this golden apple that Virgil, most learned in heroic antiquities, made the golden bough Aeneas carries into the Inferno or Underworld.’
Randolph Henry Ash's Proserpina, ‘gold-skinned in the gloom’, was also ‘grain-golden’.
Also ‘bound with golden links’ which might have been jewellery or chains.
Roland wrote neat cross-references under the headings of grain, apples, chain, treasure.
Folded into the page of Vico on which the passage appeared was a bill for candles on the back of which Ash had written: ‘The individual appears for an instant, joins the community of thought, modifies it and dies; but the species, that dies not, reaps the fruit of his ephemeral existence.’
Roland copied this out and made another card, on which he interrogated himself.
‘Query ?
Is this a quotation or is it Ash himself?
Is Proserpina the Species?
A very C19 idea.
Or is she the individual?
When did he put these papers in here?
Are they pre- or post- The Origin of Species ?
Not conclusive anyway — he cd have been interested in Development generally…’
That was 11:15.
The clock ticked, motes of dust danced in sunlight, Roland meditated on the tiresome and bewitching endlessness of the quest for knowledge.
Here he sat, recuperating a dead man's reading, timing his exploration by the library clock and the faint constriction of his belly.
(Coffee is not to be had in the London Library.)
He would have to show all this new treasure-trove to Blackadder, who would be both elated and grumpy, who would anyway be pleased that it was locked away in Safe 5 and not spirited away to Robert Dale Owen University in Harmony City, with so much else.
He was reluctant to tell Blackadder.
He enjoyed possessing his knowledge on his own.
Proserpina was between pages 288 and 289.
Under page 300 lay two folded complete sheets of writing paper.
Roland opened these delicately.
They were both letters in Ash's flowing hand, both headed with his Great Russell Street address and dated, June 21st.
No year.
Both began ‘Dear Madam’, and both were unsigned.
One was considerably shorter than the other.
Dear Madam,
Since our extraordinary conversation I have thought of nothing else.
It has not often been given to me as a poet, it is perhaps not often given to human beings, to find such ready sympathy, such wit and judgment together.
I write with a strong sense of the necessity of continuing our — talk, and without premeditation,under the impression that you were indeed as much struck as I was by our quite extraordinary to ask if it would be possible for me to call on you, perhaps one day next week.
I feel, I know with a certainty that cannot be the result of folly or misapprehension, that you and I must speak again.
I know you go out in company very little, and was the more fortunate that dear Crabb managed to entice you to his breakfast table.
To think that amongst the babble of undergraduate humour and through all Crabb's well-wrought anecdotes, even including the Bust, we were able to say so much, that was significant, simply to each other.
I cannot surely be alone in feeling 
The second one ran:
Dear Madam,
Since our pleasant and unexpected conversation I have thought of little else.
Is there any way in which it can be resumed, more privately and at more leisure?
I know you go out in company very little, and was the more fortunate that dear Crabb managed to entice you to his breakfast table.
How much I owe to his continuing good health, that he should feel able and eager, at eighty-two years of age, to entertain poets and undergraduates and mathematical professors and political thinkers so early in the day, and to tell the anecdote of the Bust with his habitual fervour without too much delaying the advent of buttered toast.
Did you not find it as strange as I did, that we should so immediately understand each other so well?
For we did understand each other uncommonly well, did we not?
Or is this perhaps a product of the over-excited brain of a middle-aged and somewhat disparaged poet, when he finds that his ignored, his arcane, his deviously perspicuous meanings, which he thought not meanings, since no one appeared able to understand them, had after all one clear-eyed and amused reader and judge?
What you said of Alexander Selkirk's monologue, the good sense you made of the ramblings of my John Bunyan, your understanding of the passion of Iñez de Castro…gruesomely resurrecta…but that is enough of my egoistical mutter, and of those of my personae , who are not, as you so rightly remarked, my masks .
I would not have you think that I do not recognise the superiority of your own fine ear and finer taste.
I am convinced that you must undertake that grand Fairy Topic — you will make something highly strange and original of it.
In connection with that, I wonder if you have thought of Vico's history of the primitive races — of his idea that the ancient gods and later heroes are personifications of the fates and aspirations of the people rising in figures from the common mind?
Something here might be made of your Fairy's legendary rootedness in veritable castles and genuine agricultural reform — one of the queerest aspects of her story, to a modern mind.
But I run on again; assuredly you have determined on your own best ways of presenting the topic, you who are so wise and learned in your retirement.
I cannot but feel, though it may be an illusion induced by the delectable drug of understanding ,that you must in some way share my eagerness that further conversation could be mutually profitable that we must meet .
I cannot  do not think I am can be mistaken in my belief that our meeting was also important interesting to you, and that however much you may value your seclusion
I know that you came only to honour dear Crabb, at a small informal party, because he had been of assistance to your illustrious father, and valued his work at a time when it meant a great deal to him.
But you did come out, so I may hope that you can be induced to vary your quiet days with
I am sure you understand
Roland was first profoundly shocked by these writings, and then, in his scholarly capacity, thrilled.
His mind busied itself automatically with dating and placing this unachieved dialogue with an unidentified woman.
There was no year on the letters, but they must necessarily come after the publication of Ash's dramatic poems,Gods, Men and Heroes , which had appeared in 1856 and had not, contrary to Ash's hopes and perhaps expectations, found favour with the reviewers, who had declared his verses obscure, his tastes perverse and his people extravagant and improbable.
‘The Solitary Thoughts of Alexander Selkirk’ was one of those poems, the musings of the castaway sailor on his island.
So was ‘The Tinker's Grace’, purporting to be Bunyan's prison musings on Divine Grace, and so was Pedro of Portugal's rapt and bizarre declaration of love, in 1356, for the embalmed corpse of his murdered wife, Iñez de Castro, who swayed beside him on his travels, leather-brown and skeletal, crowned with lace and gold circlet, hung about with chains of diamonds and pearls, her bone-fingers fantastically ringed.
Ash liked his characters at or over the edge of madness, constructing systems of belief and survival from the fragments of experience available to them.
It would be possible, Roland thought, to identify the breakfast party, which must have been one of Crabb Robinson's later efforts to provide stimulating conversation for the students of the new London University.
Crabb Robinson's papers were kept in Dr Williams's Library in Gordon Square, originally designed as University Hall, supported by Robinson as a place in which lay students could experience collegiate university life.
It would, it must, be easy to check in Robinson's diary an occasion on which Ash had breakfasted at 30 Russell Square with a professor of mathematics, a political thinker (Bagehot?) and a reclusive lady who knew about, who wrote, or proposed to write, poetry.
He had no idea who she might be.
Christina Rossetti?
He thought not.
He was not sure that Miss Rossetti would have approved of Ash's theology, or of his sexual psychology.
He could not identify the Fairy Topic, either, and this gave him a not uncommon sensation of his own huge ignorance, a grey mist, in which floated or could be discerned odd glimpses of solid objects, odd bits of glitter of domes or shadows of roofs in the gloom.
Had the correspondence continued?
If it had, where was it, what jewels of information about Ash's ‘ignored, arcane, deviously perspicuous meanings’ might not be revealed by it?
Scholarship might have to reassess all sorts of certainties.
On the other hand, had the correspondence ever in fact started?
Or had Ash finally floundered in his inability to express his sense of urgency?
It was this urgency above all that moved and shocked Roland.
He thought he knew Ash fairly well, as well as anyone might know a man whose life seemed to be all in his mind, who lived a quiet and exemplary married life for forty years, whose correspondence was voluminous indeed, but guarded, courteous and not of the most lively.
Roland liked that in Randolph Henry Ash.
He was excited by the ferocious vitality and darting breadth of reference of the work, and secretly, personally, he was rather pleased that all this had been achieved out of so peaceable, so unruffled a private existence.
He read the letters again.
Had a final draft been posted?
Or had the impulse died or been rebuffed?
Roland was seized by a strange and uncharacteristic impulse of his own.
It was suddenly quite impossible to put these living words back into page 300 of Vico and return them to Safe 5.
He looked about him: no one was looking: he slipped the letters between the leaves of his own copy of the Oxford Selected Ash, which he was never without.
Then he returned to the Vico annotations, transferring the most interesting methodically to his card index, until the clanging bell descended the stairwell, signifying the end of study.
He had forgotten about his lunch.
When he left, with his green and tomato boxes heaped on his Selected Ash, they nodded affably from behind the issue desk.
They were used to him.
There were notices about mutilation of volumes, about theft, with which he quite failed to associate himself.
He left the building as usual, his battered and bulging briefcase under his arm.
He climbed on a 14 bus in Piccadilly, and went upstairs, clutching his booty.
Between Piccadilly and Putney, where he lived in the basement of a decaying Victorian house, he progressed through his usual states of somnolence, sick juddering wakefulness, and increasing worry about Val.
CHAPTER TWO
A man is the history of his breaths and thoughts, acts, atoms and wounds, love, indifference and dislike; also of his race and nation, the soil that fed him and his forebears, the stones and sands of his familiar places, long-silenced battles and struggles of conscience, of the smiles of girls and the slow utterance of old women, of accidents and the gradual action of inexorable law, of all this and something else too, a single flame which in every way obeys the laws that pertain to Fire itself, and yet is lit and put out from one moment to the next, and can never be relumed in the whole waste of time to come.
So Randolph Henry Ash,ca 1840, when he was writing Ragnarök , a poem in twelve books, which some saw as a Christianising of the Norse myth and some trounced as atheistic and diabolically despairing.
It mattered to Randolph Ash what a man was, though he could, without undue disturbance, have written that general pantechnicon of a sentence using other terms, phrases and rhythms and have come in the end to the same satisfactory evasive metaphor.
Or so Roland thought, trained in the post-structuralist deconstruction of the subject.
If he had been asked what Roland Michell was, he would have had to give a very different answer.
In 1986 he was twenty-nine, a graduate of Prince Albert College, London (1978) and a PhD of the same university (1985).
His doctoral dissertation was entitled History, Historians and Poetry ?
A Study of the Presentation of Historical ‘Evidence’ in the Poems of Randolph Henry Ash .
He had written it under the supervision of James Blackadder, which had been a discouraging experience.
Blackadder was discouraged and liked to discourage others.
(He was also a stringent scholar.)
Roland was now employed, part-time, in what was known as Blackadder's ‘Ash Factory’(why not Ashram?,
Val had said) which operated from the British Museum, to which Ash's wife, Ellen, had given many of the manuscripts of his poems, when he died.
The Ash Factory was funded by a small grant from London University and a much larger one from the Newsome Foundation in Albuquerque, a charitable Trust of which Mortimer Cropper was a Trustee.
This might appear to indicate that Blackadder and Cropper worked harmoniously together on behalf of Ash.
This would be a misconception.
Blackadder believed Cropper to have designs on those manuscripts lodged with, but not owned by, the British Library, and to be worming his way into the confidence and goodwill of the owners by displays of munificence and helpfulness.
Blackadder, a Scot, believed British writings should stay in Britain and be studied by the British.
It may seem odd to begin a description of Roland Michell with an excursus into the complicated relations of Blackadder, Cropper and Ash, but it was in these terms that Roland most frequently thought of himself.
When he did not think in terms of Val.
He thought of himself as a latecomer.
He had arrived too late for things that were still in the air but vanished, the whole ferment and brightness and journeyings and youth of the 1960s, the blissful dawn of what he and his contemporaries saw as a pretty blank day.
Through the psychedelic years he was a schoolboy in a depressed Lancashire cotton town, untouched alike by Liverpool noise and London turmoil.
His father was a minor official in the County Council.
His mother was a disappointed English graduate.
He thought of himself as though he were an application form, for a job, a degree, a life, but when he thought of his mother, the adjective would not be expurgated, She was disappointed.
In herself, in his father, in him.
The wrath of her disappointment had been the instrument of his education, which had taken place in a perpetual rush from site to site of a hastily amalgamated three-school comprehensive, the Aneurin Bevan school, combining Glasdale Old Grammar School, St Thomas à  Beckett's C of E Secondary School and the Clothiers' Guild Technical Modern School.
His mother had drunk too much stout, ‘gone up the school’, and had him transferred from metal work to Latin, from Civic Studies to French; she had paid a maths coach with the earnings of a paper-round she had sent him out on.
And so he had acquired an old-fashioned classical education, with gaps where teachers had been made redundant or classroom chaos had reigned.
He had done what was hoped of him, always, had four A's at A Level, a First, a PhD.
He was now essentially unemployed, scraping a living on part-time tutoring, dogsbodying for Blackadder and some restaurant dishwashing.
In the expansive 1960s he would have advanced rapidly and involuntarily, but now he saw himself as a failure and felt vaguely responsible for this.
He was a small man, with very soft, startling black hair and small regular features.
Val called him Mole, which he disliked.
He had never told her so.
He lived with Val, whom he had met at a Freshers' tea party in the Student Union when he was eighteen.
He believed now, though this belief may have been a mythic smoothing of his memory, that Val was the first person his undergraduate self had spoken to, socially that was, not officially.
He had liked the look of her, he remembered, a soft, brown uncertain look.
She had been standing on her own, holding a teacup in front of her, not looking about her, but rather fixedly out of the window, as though she expected no one to approach and invited no one.
She projected a sort of calm, a lack of strife, and so he went over to join her.
And since then they had never not been together.
They signed up for the same courses and joined the same societies; they sat together in seminars and went together to the National Film Theatre; they had sex together and moved together into a one-roomed flat in their second year.
They lived frugally off a diet of porridge and lentils and beans and yogurt; they drank a little beer, making it spin out; they shared book-buying; they were both entirely confined to their grants, which did not go far in London, and could not be supplemented with holiday earnings, for these had vanished with the oil crisis.
Val had been, Roland was sure, partly responsible for his First.
(Along with his mother and Randolph Henry Ash.)
She simply expected it of him, she made him always say what he thought, she argued points, she worried constantly about whether she was, whether they both were, working hard enough.
They quarrelled hardly at all and when they did it was almost always because Roland expressed concern about Val's reserve with the world in general, her refusal to advance opinions in class, and later, even to him.
In the early days she had had lots of quiet opinions, he remembered, which she had offered him, shyly slyly, couched as a kind of invitation or bait.
There had been poems she had liked.
Once she had sat up naked in his dark digs and recited Robert Graves:
She tells her love while half asleep,
In the dark hours,
With half-words whispered low:
As Earth stirs in her winter sleep
And puts out grass and flowers
Despite the snow,
Despite the falling snow.
She had a rough voice gentled, between London and Liverpool, as the group voice was.
When Roland began to speak, after this, she put a hand over his mouth, which was as well, for he had nothing to say.
Later, Roland noticed, as he himself had his successes, Val said less and less, and when she argued, offered him increasingly his own ideas, sometimes the reverse side of the knitting, but essentially his.
She even wrote her Required Essay on ‘Male Ventriloquism: The Women of Randolph Henry Ash’.
Roland did want this.
When he suggested that she should strike out on her own, make herself noticed, speak up, she accused him of ‘taunting’ her.
When he asked, what did she mean, ‘taunting’, she resorted, as she always did when they argued, to silence.
Since silence was also Roland's only form of aggression they would continue in this way for days, or, one terrible time when Roland directly criticised ‘Male Ventriloquism', for weeks.
And then the fraught silence would modulate into conciliatory monosyllable, and back to their peaceful co-existence.
When Finals came, Roland did steadily and predictably well.
Val's papers were bland and minimal, in large confident handwriting, well laid-out.
‘Male Ventriloquism’ was judged to be good work and discounted by the examiners as probably largely by Roland, which was doubly unjust, since he had refused to look at it, and did not agree with its central proposition, which was that Randolph Henry Ash neither liked nor understood women, that his female speakers were constructs of his own fear and aggression, that even the poem-cycle,Ask to Embla , was the work, not of love but of narcissism, the poet addressing his Anima.
(No biographical critic had ever satisfactorily identified Embla.)
Val did very badly.
Roland had supposed she had expected this, but it became dreadfully obvious that she had not.
There were tears, night-long, choked, whimpering tears, and the first tantrum.
Val left him for the first time since they had set up house, and went briefly ‘home’.
Home was Croydon, where she lived with her divorced mother in a council flat, supported by social security, supplemented occasionally by haphazard maintenance payments from her father, who was in the Merchant Navy and had not been seen since Val was five.
Val had never, during their time together, proposed to Roland that they visit her mother, though Roland had twice taken her to Glasdale, where she had helped his father wash up, and had taken his mother's jeering deflation of their way of life in her stride, telling him, ‘Don't worry, Mole.
I've seen it all before.
Only mine drinks.
If you lit a match in our kitchen, it'd go up with a roar.’
When Val was gone, Roland realised, with a shock like a religious conversion, that he did not want their way of life to go on.
He rolled over, and spread his loosened limbs in the bed, he opened windows, he went to the Tate Gallery alone and looked at the dissolving blue and gold air of Turner's Norham Castle.
He cooked a pheasant for his rival in the departmental rat-race, Fergus Wolff, which was exciting and civilised, although the pheasant was tough and full of shot.
He made plans, which were not plans, but visions of solitary activity and free watchfulness, things he had never had.
After a week, Val came back, tearful and shaky, and declared that she meant at least to earn her living, and would take a course in shorthand-typing.
‘At least you want me,’ she told Roland, her face damp and glistening.
‘I don't know why you should want me, I'm no good, but you do.’
‘Of course I do,’ Roland had said.
‘Of course.’
When his DES grant ran out, Val became the breadwinner, whilst he finished his PhD.
She acquired an IBM golfball typewriter and did academic typing at home in the evenings and various well-paid temping jobs during the day.
She worked in the City and in teaching hospitals, in shipping firms and art galleries.
She resisted pressure to specialise.
She would not be drawn out to talk about her work, to which she almost never referred without the adjective ‘menial’.
‘I must do just a few more menial things before I go to bed’ or, more oddly, ‘I was nearly run over on my menial way this morning.’
Her voice acquired a jeering note, not unfamiliar to Roland, who wondered for the first time what his mother had been like before her disappointment, which in her case was his father and to some extent himself.
The typewriter clashed and harried him at night, never rhythmical enough to be ignored.
There were now two Vals.
One sat silently at home in old jeans and unevenly hanging long crêpey shirts, splashed with murky black and purple flowers.
This one had lustreless brown hair, very straight, hanging about a pale, underground face.
Just sometimes, this one had crimson nails, left over from the other, who wore a tight black skirt and a black jacket with padded shoulders over a pink silk shirt and was carefully made up with pink and brown eyeshadow, brushed blusher along the cheekbone and plummy lips.
This mournfully bright menial Val wore high heels and a black beret.
She had beautiful ankles, invisible under the domestic jeans.
Her hair was rolled into a passable pageboy and sometimes tied with a black ribbon.
She stopped short of perfume.
She was not constructed to be attractive.
Roland half wished that she was, that a merchant banker would take her out to dinner, or a shady solicitor to the Playboy Club.
He hated himself for these demeaning fantasies, and was reasonably afraid that she might suspect he nourished them.
If he could get a job, it might be easier to initiate some change.
He made applications and was regularly turned down.
When one came up in his own department there were 600 applications.
Roland was interviewed, out of courtesy he decided, but the job went to Fergus Wolff, whose track record was less consistent, who could be brilliant or bathetic, but never dull and right, who was loved by his teachers whom he exasperated and entranced, where Roland excited no emotion more passionate than solid approbation.
Fergus was also in the right field, which was literary theory.
Val was more indignant than Roland about this event, and her indignation upset him as much as his own failure, for he liked Fergus and wanted to be able to go on liking him.
Val found one of her insisting words for Fergus too, one which was askew and inaccurate.
‘That pretentious blonde bombshell’ she said of him.
‘That pretentious sexpot.’
She liked to use sexist wolf-whistle words as a kind of boomerang.
This embarrassed Roland, since Fergus transcended any such terminology; he was indeed blond, and he was indeed sexually very successful, and that was an end to it.
He came to no more meals, and Roland feared Fergus thought this was a function of his, Roland's, resentment.
When he got home that evening he could smell that Val was in a mood.
The basement was full of the sharp warmth of frying onions, which meant she was cooking something complicated.
When she was not in a mood, when she was apathetic, she opened tins or boiled eggs, or at most dressed an avocado.
When she was either very cheerful or very angry, she cooked.
She stood at the sink, chopping courgettes and aubergines, when he came in, and did not look up, so he surmised that the mood was bad.
He put down his bag quietly.
They had a cavernous basement room which they had painted apricot and white, to cheer it up; it was furnished with a double divan, two very old arm-chairs with curvaceous rolled arms and head-rests, plum and plushy and dusty, a second-hand stained-oak office desk, where Roland worked, and a newer varnished beech desk, where the typewriter sat.
These were back to back on the long side-walls each with their Habitat anglepoise, Roland's black, Val's rose-pink.
On the back wall were bookcases, made of bricks and planks, sagging under standard texts, most of them jointly owned, some duplicated.
They had put up various posters; a British Museum poster from the Koran , intricate and geometric, a Tate advertisement for a Turner exhibition.
Roland possessed three images of Randolph Henry Ash.
One, a photograph of the death mask which was one of the central pieces in the Stant Collection of Harmony City, stood on his desk.
There was a puzzle about how this bleak, broad-browed carved head had come into existence, since there also existed a photograph of the poet in his last sleep, still patriarchally bearded.
Who had shaved him, when?
Roland had wondered, and Mortimer Cropper had asked in his biography,The Great Ventriloquist , without finding an answer.
His other two portraits were photographic copies, made to order, of the two portraits of Ash in the National Portrait Gallery.
Val had banished these to the dark of the hall.
She said she did not want him staring at her, she wanted a bit of her life to herself; without having to share it with Randolph Ash.
In the dark hall the pictures were difficult to see.
One was by Manet and one was by G. F. Watts.
The Manet had been painted when the painter was in England in 1867, and had some things in common with his portrait of Zola.
He had shown Ash, whom he had met previously in Paris, sitting at his desk, in a three-quarters profile, in a carved mahogany chair.
Behind him was a kind of triptych with ferny foliage, to the left and right, enclosing a watery space in which rosy and silver fish shone between pond-weeds.
The effect was partly to set the poet amongst the roots of a wood or forest, until, as Mortimer Cropper had pointed out, one realised that the background was one of those compartmentalised Wardian cases, in which the Victorians grew plants in controlled environments, or created self-sustaining ponds, in order to study the physiology of plants and fishes.
Manet's Ash was dark, powerful, with deep set eyes under a strong brow, a vigorous beard and a look of confident private amusement.
He looked watchful and intelligent, not ready to move in a hurry.
In front of him on his desk were disposed various objects, an elegant and masterly still life to complement the strong head and the ambivalent natural growths.
There was a heap of rough geological specimens, including two almost spherical stones, a little like cannon balls, one black and one a sulphurous yellow, some ammonites and trilobites, a large crystal ball, a green glass inkwell, the articulated skeleton of a cat, a heap of books, two of which could be seen to be the Divina Commedia and Faust , and an hourglass in a wooden frame.
Of these, the inkwell, the crystal ball, the hourglass, the two named books and two of the others, which had been painstakingly identified as Quixote and Lyell's Geology , were now in the Stant Collection, where a room had been arranged, Wardian cases and all, to resemble the Manet setting.
The chair had also been collected, and the desk itself.
The portrait by Watts was mistier and less authoritative.
It had been painted in 1876 and showed an older and more ethereal poet, his head rising, as is common with Watts's portraits, from a vague dark column of a body into a spiritual light.
There was a background but it had darkened.
In the original portrait it could be vaguely made out as a kind of craggy wild place; in this photographic reproduction it was no more than thickenings and glimmerings in the black.
The important features of this image were the eyes, which were large and gleaming, and the beard, a riverful of silvers and creams, whites and blue-greys, channels and forks resembling da Vinci's turbulences, the apparent source of light.
Even in the photograph, it shone.
These pictures, Roland considered, seemed somehow more real as well as more austere, because they were photographs.
Less full of life, the life of the paint, but more realistic, in the modern sense, according to modern expectations.
They were a bit the worse for wear; the flat was not clean and was damp.
But he had no money to renew them.
At the end of the room the window opened onto a little yard, with steps to the garden, which was visible between railings in the upper third of their window.
Their flat was described as a garden flat when they came to see it, which was the only occasion on which they were asked to come into the garden, into which they were later told they had no right of entry.
They were not even allowed to attempt to grow things in tubs in their black area, for reasons vague but peremptory, put forward by their landlady, an octogenarian Mrs Irving, who inhabited the three floors above them in a rank civet fug amongst unnumbered cats, and who kept the garden as bright and wholesome and well-ordered as her living-room was sparse and decomposing.
She had enticed them in like an old witch, Val said, by talking volubly to them in the garden about the quietness of the place, giving them each a small, gold, furry apricot from the espaliered trees along the curving brick wall.
The garden was long, thin, bowery, with sunny spots of grass, surrounded by little box hedges, its air full of roses, swarthy damask, thick ivory, floating pink, its borders restraining fantastic striped and spotted lilies, curling bronze and gold, bold and hot and rich.
And forbidden.
But they did not know that in the beginning, as Mrs Irving expatiated in her cracked and gracious voice on the high brick wall which dated from the Civil War, and earlier still, which had formed one boundary of General Fairfax's lands when Putney was a separate village, when Cromwell's Trained Bands assembled there, when the Putney Debates on liberty of conscience were held in St Mary's Church on the bridge.
Randolph Henry Ash had written a poem purporting to be spoken by a Digger in Putney.
He had even come there to look at the river at low tide, it was in Ellen Ash's Journal, they had brought a picnic of chicken and parsley pie.
That fact, and the conjunction of Marvell's patron, Fairfax, with the existence of the walled garden of fruit and flowers were enough to tempt Roland and Val into the garden flat, with its prohibited view.
In spring their window was lit from above by the yellow glow of a thick row of bright daffodils.
Tendrils of Virginia creeper crept down as far as the window-frame, and progressed on little circular suckers across the glass, at huge vegetable speed.
Swathes of jasmine, loose from a prolifically flowering specimen on the edge of the house, occasionally fell over their railing, with their sweet scent, before Mrs Irving, clothed in her gardening gear of wellingtons and apron over the seated and threadbare tweed suit in which she had first enticed them in, came and bound these back.
Roland had once asked her if he could help in the garden, in exchange for the right to sit there sometimes.
He had been told that he didn't know the first thing about it, that the young were all the same, destructive and careless, that Mrs Irving set a value on her privacy.
‘You would think,’ said Val, ‘that the cats would do the garden no good.’
That was before they found the patches of damp on their own kitchen and bathroom ceilings, which, when touched with a finger, smelled unmistakably of cat-piss.
The cats too, were under prohibition, confined to quarters.
Roland thought they ought to look for somewhere else, but held back from proposing it, because he was not the breadwinner, and because he didn't want to do anything so decisive, in terms of himself and Val.
Val put before him grilled marinated lamb, ratatouille and hot Greek bread.
He said, ‘Shall I get a bottle of wine?’ and Val said, disagreeably and truthfully, ‘You should have thought of that some time back; it'll all go cold.’
They ate at a card-table, which they unfolded and folded again, after.
‘I made an amazing discovery today,’ he told her.
‘Oh?’
‘I was in the London Library.
They've got R. H. Ash's Vico.
His own copy.
They keep it in the safe.
I had it brought up and it was absolutely bursting at the seams with his own notes, all tucked in, on the backs of bills and things.
And I'm ninety per-cent sure no one had looked at them, ever, not since he put them there, because all the edges were black and the lines coincided…’
‘How interesting.’
Flatly.
‘It might change the face of scholarship.
It could.
They let me read them, they didn't take it away.
I'm sure no one knew it was all there.’
‘I expect they didn't.’
‘I'll have to tell Blackadder.
He'll want to see how important it is, make sure Cropper hasn't been there…’
‘I expect he will, yes.’
It was a bad mood.
‘I'm sorry, Val, I'm sorry to bore you.
It does look exciting.’
‘That depends what turns you on.
We all have our little pleasures of different kinds, I suppose.’
‘I can write it up.
An article.
A solid discovery.
Make me a better job prospect.’
‘There aren't any jobs.’
She added, ‘And if there are, they go to Fergus Wolff.’
He knew his Val: he had watched her honourably try to prevent herself from adding that last remark.
‘If you really think what I do is so unimportant…’
‘You do what turns you on,’ said Val.
‘Everyone does, if they're lucky, if there is anything that turns them on.
You have this thing about this dead man.
Who had a thing about dead people.
That's OK but not everyone is very bothered about all that.
I see some things, from my menial vantage point.
Last week, when I was in that ceramics export place, I found some photographs under a file in my boss's desk.
Things being done to little boys.
With chains and gags and — dirt — This week, ever so efficiently filing records for this surgeon, I just happened to come across a sixteen-year-old who had his leg off last year — they're fitting him with an artificial one, it takes months, they're incredibly slow — and it's started up for certain now in his other leg, he doesn't know, but I know, I know lots of things.
None of them fit together, none of them makes any sense.
There was a man who went off to Amsterdam to buy some diamonds, I helped his secretary book his ticket, first class, and his limousine, smooth as clockwork, and as he's walking along a canal admiring the house fronts someone stabs him in the back, destroys a kidney, gangrene sets in, now he's dead.
Just like that.
Chaps like those use my menial services, here today, gone tomorrow.
Randolph Henry Ash wrote long ago.
Forgive me if I don't care what he wrote in his Vico.’
‘Oh, Val, such horrible things, you never say —’
‘Oh, it's all very interesting , my menial keyhole observations, make no mistake.
Just it doesn't make sense and it leaves me nowhere.
I suppose I envy you, piecing together old Ash's world-picture.
Only where does that leave you , old Mole?
What's your world-picture?
And how are you ever going to afford to get us away from dripping cat-piss and being on top of each other ?’
Something had upset her, Roland reasonably deduced.
Something that had caused her to use the phrase ‘turn you on’ several times, which was uncharacteristic.
Perhaps someone had grabbed her.
Or had not done so.
No, that was unworthy.
Anger and petulance did turn her on, he knew.
He knew more than was quite good for him about Val.
He went across and stroked the nape of her neck, and she sniffed and stiffened and then relaxed.
After a bit, they moved over to the bed.
He had not told her, and could not tell her, about his secret theft.
Late that night, he looked at the letters again, in the bathroom.
‘Dear Madam, Since our extraordinary conversation, I have thought of nothing else.’
‘Dear Madam, Since our pleasant and unexpected conversation I have thought of little else.’
Urgent, unfinished.
Shocking.
Roland had never been much interested in Randolph Henry Ash's vanished body; he did not spend time visiting his house in Russell Street, or sitting where he had sat, on stone garden seats; that was Cropper's style.
What Roland liked was his knowledge of the movements of Ash's mind, stalked through the twists and turns of his syntax, suddenly sharp and — clear in an unexpected epithet.
But these dead letters troubled him, physically even, because they were only beginnings.
He did not imagine Randolph Henry Ash, his pen moving rapidly across the paper, but he did have the thought of the pads of the long-dead fingers which had held and folded these half-covered sheets, before preserving them in the book, instead of jettisoning them.
Who ?
He must try to find out.
CHAPTER THREE
In this dim place
The creeping Nidhogg, with his sooty scales
Gnaws at the great Tree's root, and makes his nest,
Curled in the knotted maze on which he feeds
R. H. Ash,Ragnarök III
Roland went to Bloomsbury on his bicycle next morning, setting off very early when Val was still applying her workaday face.
He went weaving perilously through and through the stinking five-mile worm of traffic across Putney Bridge, along the Embankment, through Parliament Square.
He had no office in his old college, but inhabited an office on sufferance, for his few hours' part-time teaching.
Here, in an empty silence, he unpacked his bicycle panniers and went up to the pantry where the bulk of the xerox squatted amongst unsavoury tea-towels beside a tea-stained sink.
Whilst the machine warmed up, in the din and hum of the extractor fan, he took out his two letters and read them again.
Then he spread them face down, to be scryed on the black glass, under which the rods of green light floated and passed.
And the machine spat out, hot and chemical-scented, spectrograms of those writings, black-rimmed by imaged empty space as the originals were edged by a century's dust.
He was honest: he wrote his debt in the departmental notebook on the draining board.
Roland Michell, 2 sheets, 10p.
He was dishonest.
He now had a fair copy and could slip the letters back unremarked into the London Library Vico.
But he did not want to.
He felt they were his.
He had always slightly despised those enchanted by things touched by the great: Balzac's ornate walking-stick, Robert Louis Stevenson's flageolet, a black lace mantilla once worn by George Eliot.
Mortimer Cropper was in the habit of drawing Randolph Henry Ash's large gold watch from an inner fob pocket, and arranging his time by Ash's timepiece.
Roland's xeroxes were cleaner and clearer than the faded coppery-grey script of the originals; indeed the copy-ink had a black and gleaming freshness, the machine's rollers must have been newly inked.
But he wanted the originals.
When Dr Williams's library opened he presented himself and asked to see the manuscript of Crabb Robinson's monumental Diary.
He had been there before, but had to use Blackadder's name, to remind them, though he had no idea of showing Blackadder what he had found, not yet at least, not until his own curiosity was satisfied and the papers restored.
He started reading in 1856, the year of publication of Gods ,Men and Heroes , which Crabb Robinson, indefatigable, had read and commented on.
JUNE 4 Read several dramatic poems from Randolph Ash's new book.
I noted particularly those purporting to be spoken by Augustine of Hippo, the ninth-century Saxon monk, Gotteschalk, and ‘Neighbour Pliable’ from Pilgrim's Progress .
Also a singular evocation of Franz Mesmer and the young Mozart playing their glass harmonica at the court of the Archduke in Vienna, full of sounds and strange airs, excellently conceived and embodied.
This Gotteschalk, a precursor of Luther, even to renouncing his Vows, might be thought in his intransigent predestinarian vision to figure some of the later Evangelicals of our day, and Neighbour Pliable perhaps a satire upon those like myself, who believe that Christianity does not consist in the idolatrous presence of the Deity in a piece of bread, nor yet in the five points of metaphysic faith.
As is his wont, Ash treats Pliable, with whom he might be supposed to sympathise, with more apparent spleen than he directs towards his monstrous monk whose ravings have a certain real sublimity.
It is difficult to know where to have Randolph Ash.
I fear he will never become a popular poet.
His evocation of the Black Forest in ‘Gotteschalk’ is very fine, but how many of the public are prepared to endure his theological strictures to come to it?
He convolutes and wreathes his melodies with such a forcing of rhyme and such a thicket of peculiar and ill-founded analogies, that his meaning is hard to discern.
When I read Ash, I think of the younger Coleridge, reciting with gusto his epigram upon Donne:
With Donne whose muse on dromedary trots
Wreathe iron pokers into true-love knots.
This passage was already well known to Ash scholars and had been extensively quoted.
Roland liked Crabb Robinson, a man of indefatigable good will, intellectual curiosity, delight in literature and learning, and yet full of self-deprecation.
‘I early found that I had not the literary ability to give me such a place among English authors as I should have desired; but I thought that I had an opportunity of gaining a knowledge of many of the distinguished men of the age, and that I might do some good by keeping a record of my interviews with them.’
He had known them all, two whole generations, Wordsworth, Coleridge, de Quincey, Lamb; Mme de Stael, Goethe, Schiller; Carlyle, G. H. Lewes, Tennyson, Clough, Bagehot.
Roland read through 1857 and embarked on 1858.
In the February of that year Robinson wrote:
Were this my last hour (and that of an octogenarian cannot be far off) I would thank God for permitting me to behold so much of the excellence conferred on individuals.
Of women, I saw the type of her, heroic greatness in Mrs Siddons; of her fascinations, in Mrs Jordan and Mlle Mars; I listened with rapture to the dreamy monologues of Coleridge —‘that old man eloquent’; I travelled with Wordsworth, the greatest of our lyrico-philosophical poets; I relished the wit and pathos of Charles Lamb; I conversed freely with Goethe at his own table, beyond all competition the supreme genius of his age and country.
He acknowledges his obligations only to Shakespeare, Spinoza and Linnaeus, as Wordsworth, when he resolved to be a poet, feared competition only with Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton.
In June, Roland found what he had been looking for.
My breakfast party went off very well indeed, ‘as far as talk was concerned.
I had with me Bagehot, Ash, Mrs Jameson, Professor Spear, Miss LaMotte and her friend Miss Glover, the last somewhat taciturn.
Ash had never met Miss LaMotte, who indeed came out exceptionally to please me and to speak of her dear Father, whose Mythologies I have had some hand in bringing before the English public.
Discussion of poetry was animated, especially of Dante's incomparable genius, but also of the genius of Shakespeare in his poems, especially the playfulness of his young works, which Ash particularly admires.
Miss LaMotte spoke more forcefully than I would have expected: she is surprisingly handsome when animated.
We discussed also the so-called ‘spiritual, manifestations, about which Lady Byron wrote to me with great feeling.
There was talk of Mrs Stowe's claim to have conversed with the spirit of Charlotte Brontë.
Miss Glover, in one of her few interventions, said warmly that she believed such things could and did happen.
Ash said he would require foolproof experimental conviction and did not imagine it would be forthcoming.
Bagehot said that Ash's presentation of Mesmer's belief in spiritual influences showed he was less rigorously confined by positive science than he now claimed to be.
Ash replied that the historical imagination required a kind of poetic belief in the mental universe of his characters and that this was so strong with him, that he was in danger of having no beliefs of his own at all.
All appealed to Miss LaMotte on the question of the rapping spirits; she declined to express an opinion, answering only with a Monna Lisa smile.
Roland copied out this passage and read on, but could find no further reference to Miss LaMotte, though Ash was a fairly frequent host and guest.
Robinson paid tribute to Mrs Ash's excellent housekeeping, and lamented that she had never become the Mother she was ideally suited to be.
He did not appear to have noticed any extraordinary knowledge of Ash's poetry in either Miss LaMotte or Miss Glover.
Perhaps the conversation, ‘pleasant and unexpected’ or alternatively ‘extraordinary’had taken place elsewhere or on another occasion.
Crabb Robinson's records looked odd transcribed in Roland's own rather cramped script, less confident, less homogeneously part of a life.
Roland knew that statistically he was almost bound to have corrupted this text in some way, if only by inadequate transcription.
Mortimer Cropper's graduate students were made to transcribe passages — usually from Randolph Henry Ash — transcribe again their own transcriptions, type them up, and then scan them for errors with a severe editorial eye.
There was never an error-free text, Cropper said.
He kept up this humbling exercise, even in the days of effortless photocopying.
There was no such professional method about Blackadder, who nevertheless noticed and corrected a plethora of errors, accompanying this correction with a steady series of disparaging comments on the declining standard of English education.
In his day, he said, students were grounded in spelling and had learned poetry and the Bible by heart.
An odd phrase, by heart, he would add, as though poems were stored in the bloodstream.
‘Felt along the heart’ as Wordsworth said,’Blackadder said.
But in the best English tradition he did not consider it his business to equip his deficient students with tools they had not got.
They must muddle through in a fog of grumble and contempt.
Roland went to the British Museum in search of Blackadder.
He had not made up his mind what to say to him, so spent time establishing a position in the Reading Room, under the high dome, which, however high, held, he felt, insufficient oxygen for all the diligent readers, so that they lay somnolent like flames dying in Humphry Davy's bell-jar as their sustenance was consumed.
It was afternoon — the morning had gone on Crabb Robinson — which meant that all the ample, high, soft-blue leather desks along the spokes of the great wheel that radiated from the Superintendent's desk, ensphered by the Catalogue, were taken, and he had to be content with one of the minimal flat triangular ends of the late-come segments inserted between these spokes.
These inserts were ghost-desks, secondary desks, stammering desks, DD GG OO.
He found a place at the end of AA (for Ash) near the door.
In his first pleasure at being admitted to this inner circle of learning he had compared it to Dante's Paradiso, in which the saints and patriarchs and virgins sat in orderly ranks in a circular formation, a huge rose, and also the leaves of a huge volume, once scattered through the universe, now gathered.
The gilt lettering on the soft-blue leather added to the mediaeval imagining.
In which case, the Ash factory, hutched in the bowels of the building was the Inferno.
There was a way down, on iron rungs, from the Reading Room, and a way out, through a high locked portal, which brought you up into the sunless Egyptian necropolis, amongst blind staring pharaohs, crouching scribes, minor sphinxes and empty mummy-cases.
The Ash factory was a hot place of metal cabinets and glass cells containing the clatter of typewriters, gloomily lit by neon tubes.
Micro-readers glowed green in its gloom.
It smelled occasionally sulphurous, when the photocopiers short-circuited.
It was even beset by wailings and odd shrieks.
The whole of the lower regions of the British Museum reeks of tom-cat.
The creatures work their way in through gratings and airbricks, prowl and are harried and occasionally stealthily fed.
Blackadder sat amongst the apparent chaos and actual order of his great edition, sifting a drift of small paper slips in a valley between cliffs of furred-edged index cards and bulging mottled files.
Behind him flitted his clerical assistant, pale Paola, her long colourless hair bound in a rubber band, her huge glasses moth-like, her finger-tips dusty grey pads.
In an inner room, beyond the typewriter cubicle, was a small cavern constructed of filing cabinets, inhabited by Dr Beatrice Nest, almost bricked in by the boxes containing the diary and correspondence of Ellen Ash.
Blackadder was fifty-four and had come to editing Ash out of pique.
He was the son and grandson of Scottish schoolmasters.
His grandfather recited poetry on firelight evenings:Marmion ,Childe Harold, Ragnarök .
His father sent him to Downing College in Cambridge to study under F. R. Leavis.
Leavis did to Blackadder what he did to serious students; he showed him the terrible, the magnificent importance and urgency of English literature and simultaneously deprived him of any confidence in his own capacity to contribute to, or change it.
The young Blackadder wrote poems, imagined Dr Leavis's comments on them, and burned them.
He devised an essay style of Spartan brevity, equivocation and impenetrability.
His fate was decided by a seminar on dating.
The Cambridge room was crowded, the floor full, the chair-arms perched on.
The lean and agile don, in his open-necked shirt, stood on the window-sill and tugged at the casement to let in fresh air, cold Cambridge light.
The dating handout contained a troubadour lyric, a piece of dramatic Jacobean verse, some satirical couplets, a blank verse meditation on volcanic mud and a love-sonnet.
Blackadder, schooled by his grandfather, saw immediately that all these poems were by Randolph Henry Ash, examples of his ventriloquism, of his unwieldy range.
He himself to proceed, with Leavis enticing unfortunate undergraduates into making wrong identifications, and then proceeding to demonstrate his own analytic brilliance in distinguishing fake from authenticity, Victorian alienation from the voice of true feeling.
Blackadder chose silence, and Ash was duly exposed and found wanting.
Blackadder felt that he had somehow betrayed Randolph Henry Ash, though he might more justly have been thought to have betrayed himself; his grandfather, or possibly Dr Leavis.
He compensated.
He wrote his PhD on Conscious Argument and Unconscious Bias: a Source of Tension in the Dramatic Poems of Randolph Henry Ash .
He became an expert on Ash in Ash's most unfashionable days.
He had been talked into editing the Complete Poems and Plays as early as 1959, with the blessing of the present Lord Ash, an elderly Methodist peer who was a descendant of a remote cousin of Ash himself and heir to the ownership of the unsold manuscripts.
He had in those days of innocence seen the Edition as a finite task that would lead on to other things.
He had research assistants, in fluctuating numbers, whom he despatched like Noah's doves and ravens into the libraries of the world, clutching numbered slips of paper, like cloakroom tickets or luncheon vouchers, each containing a query, a half-line of possible quotation, a proper name to be located.
The hub of a Roman chariot, tracked through Gibbon's footnotes.
‘The dangerous dreamed melon of the sage’ which turned out to come from the dream of Descartes.
Ash had been interested in everything.
Arab astronomy and African transport systems, angels and oakapples, hydraulics and the guillotine, druids, and the grande armée, catharists and printers' devils, ectoplasm and solar mythology, the last meals of frozen mastodons and the true nature of manna.
The footnotes engulfed and swallowed the text.
They were ugly and ungainly, but necessary, Blackadder thought, as they sprang up like the heads of the Hydra, two to solve in the place of one solved.
He thought often, in his dim place, of how a man becomes his job.
What would he be now if he had become, say, a civil servant allotting housing finance, or a policeman, poring over bits of hair and skin and thumbball prints?
(This was a very Ash-like speculation.)
What would knowledge be, collected for its own sake, for his own sake, that was, for James Blackadder, with no reference to the pickings, digestion and leavings of Randolph Henry Ash?
There were times when Blackadder allowed himself to see clearly that he would end his working life, that was to say his conscious thinking life, in this task, that all his thoughts would have been another man's thoughts, all his work another man's work.
And then he thought it did not perhaps matter so greatly.
He did after all find Ash fascinating, even after all these years.
It was a pleasant subordination, if he was a subordinate.
He believed Mortimer Cropper thought himself the lord and owner of Ash, but he, Blackadder, knew his place better.
He had once seen a naturalist on the television who seemed to him to be an analogue of himself.
This man went out with a pouch and gathered up owl-pellets, which he labelled, and later, took apart with forceps, bathed in glass beakers of various cleansing fluids, ordering and rearranging the orts and fragments of the owl's compressed package of bone, tooth and fur, in order to reconstitute the dead shrew or slow-worm which had run, died, and made its way through owl-gut.
He was pleased with this image and momentarily considered making a poem out of it.
Then he discovered Ash had been beforehand with him.
He had described an archaeologist:
Finding out ancient battles from the shards
Of shattered blades or mashed and splintered bones,
Or broken brain-pans, as the curate reads
The death of vole or slow-worm in the dried
Packets the tidy owl ejects, cast out
By white death floating by on softest sails
The bloody hook curved in the downy ruff…
Then Blackadder could not think whether he had noticed the screen naturalist because his mind was primed with Ash's image, or whether it had worked independently.
Roland emerged from tunnels of shelving into Blackadder's icily lit domain.
Paola smiled at him and Blackadder frowned.
Blackadder was a grey man, with a grey skin and iron-grey hair, which he wore rather long, because he was proud that it was still so thick.
His clothes, tweed jacket, cord trousers, were respectable, well-worn and dusty, like everything else down there.
He had a good ironic smile when he smiled, which was very infrequently.
Roland said, ‘I think I've made a discovery.’
‘It will probably turn out to have been discovered twenty times already.
What is it?’
‘I went to read his Vico and it's still crammed with his manuscript notes, bursting with them, between every page.
In the London Library.’
‘Cropper will have been through it with a toothcomb.’
‘I don't think so.
I truly don't think so.
All the dust is set in black rims, it reaches the edges of the paper.
No one 's touched it for a long, long time.
I guess not ever.
I read some.’
‘Useful?’
‘Oh, very.
Enormously.’
Blackadder, reluctant to show excitement, began to clip together bits of paper.
‘I'd better have a look,’ he said.
‘I'd better see for myself.
I'll get over there.
You didn't disturb anything?’
‘Oh no.
Oh no.’
That is, a lot of the papers simply flew out when the book was opened, but we put them back in place, I think.’
‘I don't understand it.
I thought Cropper was ubiquitous.
You'd better keep this absolutely hush-hush, you understand, or it'll all be winging its way across the Atlantic, whilst the London Library replaces its carpets and installs a coffee machine and Cropper sends us another of his nice helpful smiley-regretful Faxes, offering access to the Stant Collection and every possible assistance with microfilm.
You haven't said anything to anyone?’
‘Only the Librarian.’
‘I'll get over there.
Patriotism will have to do instead of funding.
Stop the drain.’
‘They wouldn't —’
‘I wouldn't trust anyone, faced with Cropper's cheque-book, not further than I could see.’
Blackadder was struggling into his overcoat, a shabby British Warm.
Roland had given up all thought, in any case not very realistic, of discussing the purloined letters with Blackadder.
He did, however, ask, ‘Can you tell me anything about a writer called LaMotte?’
‘Isidore LaMotte.
Mythologies , 1832.
Mythologies indigènes de la Bretagne et de la Grande Bretagne .
Also Mythologies françaises .
A great scholarly compendium of folklore and legends.
Suffused by a kind of fashionable search for the Key to All Mythologies but also with Breton national identity and culture.
Ash would almost certainly have read them, but I've no recollection of any precise use he made of them…’
‘There was a Miss LaMotte…’
‘Oh, the daughter.
She wrote religious poems, didn't she?
A gloomy little booklet called Last Things .
And children's stories.
Tales Told in November .
Things that go bump in the night.
And an epic which they say is unreadable.’
‘I think the feminists are interested in her,’ said Paola.
‘They would be,’ said Blackadder.
‘They haven't any time for Randolph Ash.
All they want is to read Ellen's endless journal once our friend in there has actually managed to bring it to the light of day.
They think Randolph Ash suppressed Ellen's writing and fed off her imagination.
They'd have a hard time proving that, I think, if they were interested in proof; which I'm not sure they are.
They know what there is to find before they've seen it.
All they've got to go on is that she spent a lot of time lying on the sofa, and that's hardly unusual for a lady in her time and circumstances.
Their real problem — and Beatrice's — is that Ellen Ash is dull .
No Jane Carlyle, more's the pity.
Poor old Beatrice began by wanting to show how self-denying and supportive Ellen Ash was and she messed around looking up every recipe for gooseberry jam and every jaunt to Broadstairs for twenty-five years , can you believe it, and woke up to find that no one wanted self-denial and dedication any more, they wanted proof that Ellen was raging with rebellion and pain and untapped talent.
Poor Beatrice.
One publication to her name, and a slim book called Helpmeets without irony doesn't go down well with today's feminists.
One little anthology in 1950 of wise, witty and tender sayings from the female companions of the great.
D. Wordsworth, J. Carlyle, E. Tennyson, Ellen Ash.
But the Women's Studies people can't get their hands on all that stuff to publish as long as poor old Bea is still the official editor.
She doesn't know what's hit her.’
Roland did not want to hear another long speech from Blackadder about Beatrice Nest's long-delayed edition of Ellen Ash.
There was a note that came into Blackadder's voice when he got onto the subject of Beatrice, a jarring, snarling note, that put Roland in mind of hounds baying.
(He had never heard hounds baying except on the television.)
The idea of Cropper produced a furtive, conspiratorial look in the scholar.
Roland did not offer to accompany Blackadder to the London Library.
He went off to look for coffee.
After that he could pursue Miss LaMotte, who now had an identity of sorts, through the Catalogue, like any other dead soul.
He emerged amongst the Egyptian heavyweights and saw, between two huge stone legs, something rapid and white and golden that turned out to be Fergus Wolff, also heading for coffee.
Fergus was very tall, with brassy hair cut long on top and short at the back, in the 1980s version of the 1930s, over a dazzling white heavy sweater and loose black trousers like a Japanese martial artist.
He smiled at Roland, a pleased, voracious smile, with bright blue eyes and a long mouth terribly full of strong white teeth.
He was older than Roland, a child of the Sixties who had temporarily dropped out, opted for freedom and Parisian revolutions, sitting at the feet of Barthes and Foucault, before coming back to dazzle Prince Albert College.
He was pleasant enough in general, though most people who met him formed the vaguest of ideas that he might be dangerous in some unspecified way.
Roland liked Fergus because Fergus seemed to like him.
Fergus was writing a deconstructive account of Balzac's Chef-d'Oeuvre Inconnu .
Roland had ceased to be surprised that an English Department was sponsoring the study of French books.
There seemed to be nothing else nowadays, and in any case Roland did not want to be thought insular.
His own French, owing to his mother's passionate interference with his education, was good.
Fergus sprawled in the cafeteria banquette and said the challenge was to deconstruct something that had apparently already deconstructed itself, since the book was about a painting that turned out to be nothing but a chaotic mass of brush-strokes.
Roland listened politely and said, ‘Do you know anything about a Miss LaMotte who wrote children's stories and religious poetry in the 1850s or thereabouts?’
Fergus laughed rather a long time at this, and said tersely, ‘I should.’
‘Who was she?’
‘Christabel LaMotte.
Daughter of Isidore, the mythographer.
Last Things.
Tales Told in November .
An epic called The Fairy Melusina .
Very bizarre.
Do you know about Melusina?
She was a fairy who married a mortal to gain a soul, and made a pact that he would never spy on her on Saturdays, and for years he never did, and they had six sons, all with strange defects — odd ears, giant tusks, a catshead growing out of one cheek, three eyes, that sort of thing.
One was called Geoffroy à la Grande Dent and one was called Horrible.
She built castles, real ones that still exist, in Poitou.
And in the end, of course, he looked through the keyhole — or made one in her steel door with his sword-point according to one version — and there she was in a great marble bath disporting herself.
And from the waist down she was a fish or a serpent, Rabelais says an ‘andouille’, a kind of huge sausage, the symbolism is obvious, and she beat the water with her muscular tail.
And he said nothing and she did nothing until Geoffroy, the tough son, took exception to his brother Fromont taking refuge in a monastery, and when he wouldn't come out, he piled up brushwood and burned the whole thing down, monks and Fromont and all.
And when this was reported, Raimondin (he was the original knight, the husband) said, ‘This is all your fault, I should never have married a horrible snake.’
And then she reproached him and turned into a dragon, and flew away round the battlements making a terrible noise and battering the stones.
Oh, before that she gave him strict injunctions to be sure to kill Horrible or he would destroy them all, which was duly done.
And she comes back to the Counts of Lusignan to foretell deaths — she is a kind of Dame Blanche, or Fata Bianca.
There are all sorts of symbolic and mythological and psychoanalytic interpretations, you can imagine.
Christabel LaMotte wrote this long and very convoluted poem about Melusina's story in the 1860s and it was published at the beginning of the 1870s.
It's an odd affair — tragedy and romance and symbolism rampant all over it, a kind of dream-world full of strange beasts and hidden meanings and a really weird sexuality or sensuality.
The feminists are crazy about it.
They say it expresses women's impotent desire.
It wasn't much read until they rediscovered it — Virginia Woolf knew it, she adduced it as an image of the essential androgyny of the creative mind — but the new feminists see Melusina in her bath as a symbol of self-sufficient female sexuality needing no poor males.
I like it, it's disturbing.
It keeps changing focus.
From very precise description of the scaly tail to cosmic battles.’
‘That's very useful.
I'll look it up.’
‘Why do you want to know?’
‘I came across a reference in Randolph Ash.
There's a reference to almost everything in Randolph Ash, sooner or later.
Why did I make you laugh?’
‘I became an involuntary expert on Christabel LaMotte.
There are two people in the world who know all that is known about Christabel LaMotte.
One is Professor Leonora Stern, in Tallahassee.
And the other is Dr Maud Bailey in Lincoln University.
I met them both at that Paris conference on sexuality and textuality I went to.
If you remember.
I don't think they like men.
Nevertheless I had a brief affair with the redoubtable Maud.
In Paris and then here.’
He stopped and frowned to himself.
He opened his mouth to say more and then closed it again.
He said after a time, ‘She — Maud — runs a Women's Resource Centre in Lincoln.
They've got quite a lot of Christabel's unpublished papers there.
If you want anything out of the way, there's where to look.’
‘I might.
Thanks.
What is she like?
Will she eat me?’
‘She thicks men's blood with cold,’ said Fergus with a lot of undecodable feeling.
CHAPTER FOUR
The Thicket is Thorny
Up snakes the glassy Tower
Here is no sweet Dovecote
Nor plump Lady's Bower
The wind whistles sourly
Through that Sharp land
At the black casement
He sees her white hand
He hears the foul Old One
Call quavering there
Rapunzel Rapunzel
Let down your Hair
Filaments Glosses
Run trembling down
Gold torrent loosened
From a gold Crown
The black claws go clutching
Hand over hand
What Pain goes shrilling
Through every strand!
Silent he watches
The humped One rise
With tears of anguish
In his own eyes
Christabel LaMotte
When Roland arrived in Lincoln he was already irritated by having to take the train.
It would have been cheaper to have taken the coach, if longer, but Dr Bailey had sent a curt postcard telling him it would be best for her to meet him off the noon train; the campus was some way out of town, it would be best that way.
On the train, however, it was possible to try to catch up on what there was to know about Christabel LaMotte.
His college library had provided two books.
One was very slim and ladylike, written in 1947 and entitled White Linen after one of Christabel's lyrics.
The other was a fat collection of feminist essays, mostly American, published in 1977:Herself Herself Involve, LaMotte's Strategies of Evasion .
Veronica Honiton provided some biographical information.
Christabel's grandparents, Jean-Baptiste and Emilie LaMotte, had fled to England in the Terror of 1799 and had settled there, choosing not to return after the fall of Bonaparte.
Isidore, born in 1801, had gone to Cambridge, and toyed with writing poetry, before becoming a serious historian and mythographer
much influenced by German researches on folk-tales and the origins of biblical narrative, but staunch in his own mystical Breton brand of Christianity.
His mother, Emilie, was an older sister of the republican and anticlerical historian, also a folklore enthusiast, Raoul de Kercoz, who still maintained the family manor of Kernemet.
In 1828 Isidore married Miss Arabel Gumpert, daughter of Canon Rupert Gumpert of St Paul's, whose firm religious faith was a powerful steadying influence on Christabel's childhood.
There were two daughters of the marriage, Sophie, born in 1830, who became the wife of Sir George Bailey, of Seal Close, in the Lincolnshire Wolds, and Christabel, born in 1825, who lived with her parents until in 1853 a small independence, left her by a maiden aunt, Antoinette de Kercoz, enabled her to set up house in Richmond in Surrey, with a young woman friend whom she had met at a lecture of Ruskin's.
Miss Blanche Glover, like Christabel, had artistic ambitions, and painted large canvases in oil, none of which have survived, as well as carving the skilful and mysterious wood engravings which illustrate Christabel's delightful, if slightly disquieting,Tales for Innocents , and Tales Told in November , and her religious lyrics,Orisons .
It is believed to be Miss Glover who first encouraged Christabel to embark on the grandiose and obscure epic poem,The Fairy Melusina , a retelling of the old tale of the magical half-woman, half-snake.
The rifts of the The Fairy Melusina are heavily overloaded with ore; during the Pre-Raphaelite Period it was admired by certain critics, including Swinburne, who called it, ‘a quiet, muscular serpent of a tale, with more vigour and venom than is at all usual in the efforts of the female pen, but without narrative thrust; rather, as was Coleridge's Serpent who figured the Imagination, with its tail stuffed in its own mouth.’
It is now deservedly forgotten.
Christabel's reputation, modest but secure, rests on the restrained and delicate lyrics, products of a fine sensibility, a somewhat sombre temperament, and a troubled but steadfast Christian faith.
Miss Glover was unfortunately drowned in the Thames in1861.
The death seems to have had a distressing effect on Christabel, who returned eventually to her family, living with her sister Sophie for the rest of her quiet and uneventful life.
After Melusina she appears to have written no more poetry, and retreated further and further into voluntary silence.
She died in 1890 aged sixty-six.
Veronica Honiton's comments on Christabel's poetry concentrated sweetly on her ‘domestic mysticism’, which she compared to George Herbert's celebration of the servant who ‘sweeps a room as for Thy laws’.
I like things clean about me
Starched and gophered frill
What is done exactly
Cannot be done ill
The house is ready spotless
Waiting for the Guest
Who will see our white linen
At its very best
Who will take it and fold it
And lay us to rest.
Thirty years later the feminists saw Christabel LaMotte as distraught and enraged.
They wrote on ‘Ariachne's Broken Woof: Art as Discarded Spinning in the Poems of LaMotte.’
Or ‘Melusina and the Daemonic Double: Good Mother, Bad Serpent.’
‘A Docile Rage: Christabel LaMotte's Ambivalent Domesticity.’
‘White Gloves: Blanche Glover: occluded Lesbian sexuality in LaMotte.’
There was an essay by Maud Bailey herself on ‘Melusina, Builder of Cities: a Subversive Female Cosmogony.’
Roland knew he should tackle this piece first, but was inhibited by its formidable length and density.
He started ‘Ariachne's Broken Woof which elegantly dissected one of Christabel's insect poems, of which there were apparently many.
From so blotched and cramped a creature
painfully teased out
With ugly fingers, filaments of wonder
Bright snares about
Lost buzzing things, an order fine and bright
Geometry threading water, catching light.
It was hard to concentrate.
The Midlands went flatly past, a biscuit factory, a metal box company, fields, hedges, ditches, pleasant and unremarkable.
Miss Honiton's book contained, as a frontispiece, the first image he had seen of Christabel, a brownish, very early photograph, veiled under a crackling, protective translucent page.
She was dressed in a large triangular mantle and a small bonnet, frilled inside its rim, tied with a large bow under her chin.
Her clothes were more prominent than she was, she retreated into them, her head, perhaps quizzically, perhaps considering itself ‘birdlike’, held on one side.
She had pale crimped hair over her temples, and her lips were parted to reveal large, even teeth.
The picture gave no clear impression of anyone in particular; it was generic Victorian lady, specific shy poetess.
At first he did not identify Maud Bailey, and he himself was not in any way remarkable, so that they were almost the last pair at the wicket gate.
She would be hard to miss, if not to recognise.
She was tall, tall enough to meet Fergus Wolff's eyes on the level, much taller than Roland.
She was dressed with unusual coherence for an academic, Roland thought, rejecting several other ways of describing her green and white length, a long pine-green tunic over a pine-green skirt, a white silk shirt inside the tunic and long softly white stockings inside long shining green shoes.
Through the stockings veiled flesh diffused a pink gold, almost.
He could not see her hair, which was wound tightly into a turban of peacock-feathered painted silk, low on her brow.
Her brows and lashes were blond; he observed so much.
She had a clean, milky skin, unpainted lips, clear cut features, largely composed.
She did not smile.
She acknowledged him and tried to take his bag, which he refused to allow.
She drove an immaculately glossy green Beetle.
‘I was intrigued by your question,’ she said, as they drove off.
‘I'm glad you made the effort to come.
I hope it will be worth it.’
Her voice was deliberately blurred patrician; a kind of flattened Sloane.
She smelled of something ferny and sharp.
Roland didn't like her voice.
‘It may be a wild-goose chase.
It's almost nothing really.’
‘We'll see.’
Lincoln University was white-tiled towers, variegated with violet tiles and orange tiles and from time to time acid-green tiles.
In high winds, Dr Bailey said, these blew off and were a real hazard to walkers.
There were often high winds.
The campus was fenny-flat, laid out like a kind of chess-board, redeemed by an imaginative water-gardener who had made a maze of channels and pools, randomly flowing across and around the rectangular grid.
They were now clogged with fallen leaves, amongst which Koi carp pushed blunt pearly noses.
The University dated from the opulent heyday of expansion and was now slightly grubby and tatty, mortared cracks grinning between the white oblongs under their urban plaque.
The wind stirred the silk fringes of Dr Bailey's too-rich headgear.
It ruffled Roland's black fur.
He pushed his hands in his pockets and stepped a little behind her as she strode.
No one else seemed to be about, although it was term.
He asked Dr Bailey, where were the students and she told him that today, Wednesday, was a non-teaching day, reserved for sports and study.
‘They all disappear.
We don't know where.
as if by magic.
Some of them are in the library.
Most aren't.
I don't where they go.’
The wind ruffled the dark water; orange leaves made its surface jagged and sloppy at once.
She lived at the top of Tennyson Tower —‘It was that or Maid Marian,’ she remarked, as they swung its glass door, her voice distantly scornful.
‘The Alderman who funded it wanted it all called after Sherwood folk.
Here is the English Department and the Arts Faculty Office and History of Art and also Women's Studies.
Not our Resource Centre.
That's in the Library.
I'll take you.
Would you care for coffee?’
They went up in a paternoster lift which cranked regularly past its otherwise vacant portals.
These doorless lifts unnerved Roland; she stepped in precisely and was lifted above him before he dared follow, so that he was already clambering onto the pedestal she occupied when he lunged forward and up, almost too late.
She did not remark on this.
The walls of the paternoster were mirror-tiled, bronze-lit; she flashed at him from wall to wall, hotly.
Out again she came precisely; he tripped on this threshold too, the floor lifting beneath him.
Her room was glass-walled on one side, and lined floor to ceiling with books on the others.
The books were arranged rationally, thematically, alphabetically, and dust-free; this last was the only sign of housekeeping in that austere place.
The beautiful thing in that room was Maud Bailey herself, who went down on one knee very gracefully to plug in a kettle, and produced from a cupboard two blue and white Japanese mugs.
‘Take a seat,’ she said crisply, indicating a low upholstered bright blue chair where students no doubt sat to have their work handed back.
She handed him walnut-coloured Nescafé.
She had not taken off the headdress.
‘Now, how can I be of help to you?’ she said, taking her own seat behind the barrier of the desk.
Roland meditated strategies of evasion of his own.
He had vaguely imagined, before meeting her, that he might be able to show her xeroxes of the purloined letters.
Now he knew he could not.
Her voice lacked warmth.
He said, ‘I am working on Randolph Henry Ash.
As I wrote to you.
It's just come to my attention that he might have corresponded with Christabel LaMotte.
I don't know if you have any knowledge of such a correspondence?
They certainly met.’
‘When?’
He handed her a copy of his transcript of Crabb Robinson's Journal.
‘That might be mentioned in Blanche Glover's diary.
We've got one of her diaries in the Resource Centre.
It covers that period — she began it when they moved to Richmond.
The papers we have in our Archive are essentially the contents of Christabel's desk when she died — she expressed a wish that they should be sent to one of her nieces, May Bailey, ‘in the hope that she may come to care about poetry’.’
‘And did she?’
‘Not as far as I know.
She married a cousin and went off to Norfolk and had ten children and ran a large household.
I'm descended from her — she was my great-great-grandmother, which makes me Christabel's great-great-great-niece.
I persuaded my father to let us lodge the papers in the Archive when I came here.
There isn't a lot of material, but it's important.
Manuscripts of the Tales, lots of undated lyrics on random little slips of paper, and of course all the revisions of Melusina , which she rewrote at least eight times, always changing it.
And a commonplace book, and a few letters from friends, and this one diary of Blanche Glover's, just for three years.
I don't know if we once had more — no care was taken of them, I'm sorry to say — none has come to light.’
‘And LaMotte.
Did she keep a journal?’
‘Not as far as we know.
Almost certainly not.
She wrote to one of her nieces advising against it.
It's a rather good letter.
‘If you can order your Thoughts and shape them into Art, good: if you can live in the obligations and affections of Daily Life, good.
But do not get into the habit of morbid self-examination.
Nothing so unfits a woman for producing good work, or for living usefully.
The Lord will take care of the second of these — opportunities will be found.
The first is a matter of Will.’’
‘I'm not sure about that.’
‘It's an interesting view of it.
That's late — 1886.
Art as will.
Not a fashionable view for a woman.
Or maybe for anyone.’
‘Do you have her letters?’
‘Not many.
A few family ones — admonitions like that, recipes for bread-baking and wine-making, complaints.
Others exist, not many from the Richmond period, one or two from visits she made to  Brittany ; she had family there, as maybe you know.
She doesn't seem to have had intimate friends, except Miss Glover, and they didn't need to correspond, since they shared their house.
The letters haven't been edited — Leonora Stern's trying to get something together, but there's little to go on.
I suspect Sir George Bailey at Seal Court may have something but he's not willing to let anyone look.
He threatened Leonora with a shotgun.
I thought it might be better if she went there — she's from Tallahassee, as you no doubt know — rather than myself, since there's an unfortunate history of litigation and unpleasantness between the Seal Court family and the Norfolk one.
But Leonora's approaches had a most unfortunate effect.
Most unfortunate.
Yes.
Well.
And how did you come to form the opinion that Randolph Henry Ash was interested in LaMotte?’
‘I found an unfinished draft of a letter to an unidentified woman in a book of his.
I thought it might be her.
It mentioned Crabb Robinson.
He said she understood his poems.’
‘That doesn't sound very probable.
I wouldn't have thought his poems would appeal to her.
All that cosmic masculinity.
That nasty anti-feminist poem about the medium, what was it,Mummy Possest ?
All that ponderous obfuscation.
Everything she wasn't.’
Roland considered the pale incisive mouth with a kind of hopelessness.
He wished he had not come.
The hostility towards Ash somehow included himself, at least in his own eyes.
Maud Bailey went on: ‘I've checked my card index — I'm working on a full-length study of Melusina I've only found one reference to Ash.
It's from a note to William Rossetti — the MS is in Tallahassee — about a poem he published for her.
‘In these dim November days I resemble nothing more than that poor Creature of RHA's Fantasy, immured in her terrible In-Pace , quieted perforce and longing for her Quietus.
It takes a Masculine Courage to find pleasure in constructing Dungeons for Innocents in his Fancy, and a Female Patience to endure them in sober fact.’’
‘That's a reference to Ash's Incarcerated Sorceress ?’
‘Of course.’
Impatiently.
‘When was it written!’
‘1869.
I think.
Yes.
Vivid but not much help.’
‘Hostile if anything.’
‘Exactly.’
Roland sipped his coffee.
Maud Bailey reinserted the card into its place in her file.
She said, looking into the box, ‘You must know Fergus Wolff, he must be at your college, I think.’
‘Oh yes.
It was Fergus who suggested I should ask you about LaMotte.’
A pause.
The fingers moved busily, tidying.
‘I know Fergus.
I met him at a Conference, in Paris.’
A little less crisp, the voice, a little less elderly-authoritative, he thought unkindly.
‘He told me,’ said Roland, neutrally, watching for a sign of her consciousness of what Fergus might have said, of how he might have spoken.
She compressed her lips and stood up.
‘I'll take you to the Resource Centre.’
The Lincoln Library could not have been more different from the Ash Factory.
It was a skeletal affair in a glass box, with brilliant doors opening in glass and tubular walls, like a box of toys or a giant ConstructoKit.
There were dinging metal shelves and footfall-deadening felt carpets, pied-piper red and yellow, like the paint on the stair-rails and lifts.
In summer it must have been bright and baking, but in wet autumn slate-grey sky lay like another box against its repeating panes, in which lines of little round lights were reflected, like Tinkerbell's fairylights in her Never-Never-Land.
The Women's Archive was housed in a high-walled fish-tank.
Maud Bailey settled Roland into a tubular chair at a pale oak table, like a recalcitrant nursery-school child, and put before him various boxes.
Melusina I. Melusina II.
Melusina III and IV.
Melusina Unassigned.
Breton Poems.
Poems of Devotion .
Misc Lyrics.
Blanche .
In this box she showed him a long thick green book, a little like an accounts book, with sombre marbled endpapers:
A Journal of Our Home-Life.
In Our House in Richmond
Blanche Glover
Commenced on the day of our setting up house .
May 1st May Day 1853
Roland took it up respectfully.
It did not have for him the magnetic feel of the two letters which were folded into his pocket, but it represented the tease of curiosity.
He was worried about his Day Return ticket.
He was worried about Maud's limited patience.
The journal was written in an excited and pretty hand, in short rushes.
He skimmed it.
Carpets, curtains, the pleasures of retirement, ‘Today we engaged a Cook general’, a new way to stew rhubarb, a painting of the infant Hermes and his mother, and yes, Crabb Robinson's breakfast.
‘Here it is.’
‘Good.
I'll leave you.
I'll fetch you when the Library shuts.
You've got a couple of hours.’
‘Thank you.’
We went out to breakfast with Mr Robinson, a pleasant but prosy old gentleman who told us a complicated tale of a bust of Wieland, retrieved by himself from unworthy oblivion, to the great delight of Goethe and other literary eminences.
Not much of interest was said, and certainly not by shadowy me, though that is as I would have it.
Present were Mrs Jameson, Mr Bagehot, Ash the poet, without Mrs Ash, who was indisposed, and some younger members of the London University.
The Princess was much admired and rightly.
She spoke great good sense to Mr Ash, whose poetry I cannot like, though she professed to like it greatly, which naturally flattered him.
He lacks, in my view, the lyrical flow and intensity of Alfred Tennyson, and I doubt his seriousness.
His poem about Mesmer is a great puzzle to me, as I cannot tell with any certainty what is his attitude to Animal Magnetism, whether mocking or endorsing, and this is so with other of his work, so that often one is led to wonder whether there is not a great pother of talk about nothing much.
For my part, I endured a long disquisition on the Tractarians from a young and opinionated university liberal.
He would have been much surpris'd to know my true Opinion on these matters, but I did not chuse to let him be so much familiar, I kept mum, and smiled and nodded as best I might, keeping my Thoughts to myself.
But I was almost glad when Mr Robinson decided to tell the company at large of his Italian journeyings with Wordsworth, who desired to be back at home with every step they made, and could only with the utmost difficulty be persuaded to look about him.
I too desired to be at home, and was glad when we were able to close our own dear front door behind us, and be gathered in to the silence of our little parlour.
A home is a great thing, as I had not courage to say to Mr Robinson, if it is certainly one's own home , as our little house is.
When I think of my previous existence — of all I thought I could reasonably expect of the rest of my life, an allowed place at the extreme corner of someone's drawing-room carpet, a Servant's garret or no better, I give thanks for every little thing, which is unspeakably dear to me.
We had a late luncheon, cold fowl and a salad got up by Liza, walked in the Park in the afternoon, worked, and in the evening had a dish of warm milk and white bread, sprinkled with sugar, quite as Wordsworth himself might have done.
We played and sang together, and read aloud a little of the Faerie Queene .
Our days weave together the simple pleasures of daily life, which we should never take for granted, and the higher pleasures of Art and Thought which we may now taste as we please, with none to forbid or criticise.
Surely Richmond is Beulah, I said to the Princess, who said it was only to be hoped no wicked Fairy envied us our pleasant lot.
Nothing further, for three and a half weeks, except simple meals, walks and readings, music and Blanche's plans for paintings.
Then Roland found a sentence which could have been something or nothing.
Nothing if you were not looking carefully.
I have been wondering whether to attempt, in oils, a subject from Malory, the imprisoning of Merlin, maybe, by the damsel Nimue, or the solitary Maid of Astolat.
My brain is filled full of vague images, but no clear vision of one necessary thing.
I have sketched oak trees in Richmond Park all week — all my lines are too light for the thick solidity of their girth.
What draws us to make pretty what should express Brute Power?
Nimue or the Lily Maid would require a model and the Princess can hardly be asked for so much of her time, though I hope she may think the time spent on ‘Christabel before Sir Leoline’ was not wholly wasted.
I paint so thinly, as though my work were unlit stained glass that requires a flood of light from beyond and behind to illuminate and enliven it, and there is no beyond and behind.
Oh I want Force .
She has hung ‘Christabel’ in her bedroom where it catches the morning sun and shows up my imperfections.
She is much exercised about a long letter which arrived today, which she did not show me, but smiled over, and caught up and folded away.
There was nothing at all, except Roland's own need and concern, to suggest that the long letter might be his own letter.
It could have been any letter.
Had there been more?
Three weeks later he found another meaningful/meaningless sentence.
Liza and I have been busy with our apple-and-quince jelly; the kitchen is veiled and festooned in dripping jelly-muslin, ingeniously caught up amongst the legs of inverted chairs, like spider-webs.
Liza burned her tongue, testing whether it would set or not, and being too greedy to taste or anxious to please.
(Liza is greedy.
I am sure she consumes bread and fruit in the middle of the night.
Coming down to breakfast I find raw, slanting cuts I never made on the loaf in the crock.)
The Princess did not help us this year.
She was getting her Literary Letter ready to post, though she denied this, and said she was hurrying to finish the Glass Coffin for the book of tales.
I believe she is writing fewer poems.
Certainly she does not show me them, of an evening, as we were used to do.
All this correspondence is detrimental to her true gifts.
She is in no real need of epistolary adulation.
She knows her own worth.
I only wish I were as sure of mine.
Two weeks later:
Letters, letters, letters.
Not for me.
I am not meant to see or know.
I am no blind mouldiwarp, my Lady, nor no well-trained lady's maid to turn my head and not see what is stated not to concern me.
You need not hurry them away to lie in your sewing-basket or run upstairs to fold them under your handkerchiefs.
I am no Sneak, no watcher, no Governess.
A governess is what I am most surely not.
From that fate you rescued me, and you shall never, for one moment, one little moment, suppose me ungrateful or making claims.
Two weeks later:
So now we have a Prowler.
Something is ranging and snuffing round our small retreat, trying the shutters and huffing and puffing inside the door.
In old days they put  mountain ash berries and a cast horseshoe over the lintel to frighten away the Fairy Folk.
I shall nail some up now, to show, to prevent passage, if I may.
Dog Tray is nervous of prowlers.
His hackles go up on his shoulders, as a wolf's would, when he hears the Hunter.
He gnashes the empty air.
How very small, how very safe, is a threatened dwelling.
How large the locks seem, how appalling would be their forcing and splintering.
Two weeks later:
Where is our frankness of intercourse?
Where the small, unspeakable things we used to share in quiet harmony?
This Peeping Tom has put his eye to the nick or cranny in our walls and peers shamelessly in.
She laughs and says he means no harm, and is incapable of seeing the essential things we know and keep safe, and so it is, so it must be, so it must always be.
But it amuses her to hear him lolloping and panting round our solid walls, she thinks he will always be Tame, as he is now.
I cannot claim to know better, I know nothing, I never have known very much, but I fear for her.
I asked her how much writing she had lately done, and she laughed, and said she was learning so much, so very much, and when it was all learned she should have new matter to write about and many new things to say.
And she kissed me, and called me her dear Blanche, and said I knew she was a good girl, and very strong, and not foolish.
I said we were all, all foolish, and in need of divine strength to help us out when we were weak.
She said she had never so much felt its presence, its immediacy, as lately.
I went up to my bedchamber and prayed, as I have not prayed — from desolation — since I prayed to leave Mrs Teape's house and thought I should never be answered.
The candle flame ran huge shadows like grasping fingers across the ceiling in the draught.
I could put some such running, grasping lines of light and shadow around Nimue and Merlin.
She came in to me as I knelt there and raised me up, and said we must never quarrel and that she would never, ever, give me cause to doubt her, and I must not suppose she could.
I am sure she meant what she said.
She was agitated; there were a few tears.
We were quiet together, in our special ways, for a long time.
Next day:
The Wolf is Gone from the Door.
Dog Tray's hearth is his own.
I have begun on the Lily Maid of Astolat, which suddenly seemed best.
This writing ended, indeed the book ended, abruptly, not even at the end of the year.
Roland wondered if there were other diaries.
He put little slips of paper in the entries that made up his fragile narrative or non-narrative.
There was no evidence to connect the Prowler with the letter-writer, or the letter-writer with Randolph Henry Ash, and yet he felt a powerful conviction that all three were one and the same.
If they were, would not Blanche have said so?
He must ask Maud Bailey about the Prowler, yet how could he do so without coming clean in some way — about his own interest in the matter?
And exposing himself to that censorious and supercilious gaze?
Maud Bailey put her head round the door.
‘Library's closing.
Did you find anything?’
‘I think so.
It may be all in my own head.
There are things I need to ask someone, you.
Is it permitted to photocopy the manuscript?
I simply haven't had time to copy out what I've found.
I —’
‘You seem to have had a profitable afternoon.’
Drily.
Then, as a concession, ‘Exciting, even.’
‘I don't know .
The whole thing is a wild-goose chase.’
‘If I can help —’ said Maud, having packed away Blanche's pages into their box.
‘I shall be only too happy.
Let's have coffee.
There's an SCR Coffee place in the Women's Studies block.’
‘Am I allowed in?’
‘Naturally,’ said the frigid voice.
They sat down at a low table in the corner, under a poster for the Campus Crèche and facing posters for the Pregnancy Advisory Service —‘A woman has a right to decide about her own body.
We put women first’— and a Feminist Revue: Come and see the Sorcieres, the Vamps, the daughters of Kali and the Fatae Morganae.
We'll make your blood run cold and make you laugh on the Sinister side of your face at Women's Wit and Wickedness.
The room was largely uninhabited: a group of women in jeans were laughing in the opposite corner, and two girls were in earnest conversation by the window, pink spiky heads leaning together.
Maud Bailey's excessive elegance was even odder in this context.
She was a most untouchable woman; Roland, who had desperately decided to gamble on showing her the xeroxes of the letters who wanted secrecy and privacy, was forced to lean forward in a kind of pseudo-intimacy and speak low.
‘You know this Prowler Blanche Glover got so worried about?
Is anything known about him?
The wolf at the door?’
‘Nothing certain.
I think Leonora Stem has made a tentative identification with a young Mr Thomas Hearst of Richmond who liked to come and play the oboe with the ladies.
They were both accomplished pianists.
There do exist two or three letters from Christabel to Hearst — she even sent him a few poems in one, which he kept, fortunately for us.
He married someone else in 1860 and drops out of the picture.
Blanche may have made up the prowling.
She had a vivid imagination.’
‘And was jealous.’
‘Of course.’
‘And the literary letters she refers to?
Is it known who they were from?
Or if they were connected to the ‘Prowler?’
‘Not as far as I know.
She had abundant letters from people like Coventry Patmore who admired her ‘sweet simplicity’ and ‘noble resignation’.
Lots of people wrote.
It could have been anyone.
You think it's R. H. Ash?’
‘No.
I just.
I think I'd better show you what I have.’
He brought out the photocopies of his two letters.
Whilst she was unfolding them, he said, ‘I should explain.
I found these.
I haven't shown them to anyone else.
No one knows they exist.’
She was reading.
‘Why?’
‘I don't know.
I kept them to myself.
I don't know why.’
She finished reading.
‘Well,’ she said, ‘the dates fit.
You could make up a whole story.
On no real evidence.
It would change all sorts of things.
LaMotte scholarship.
Even ideas about Melusina .
That Fairy Topic.
It's intriguing .’
‘Isn't it?
It would change Ash scholarship, too.
His letters are really rather boring, correct and distant really — this is quite different.’
‘Where are the originals?’
Roland hesitated.
He needed help.
He needed to speak.
‘I took them,’ he said.
‘I found them in a book and I took them.
I didn't think about it, I just took them.’
‘Why ?’
Stern but much more animated.
‘Why did you?’
‘Because they were alive.
They seemed urgent — I felt I had to do something.
It was an impulse.
Quick as a flash.
I meant to put them back.
I will.
Next week.
I just haven't, yet.
I don't think they're mine , or anything.
But they aren't Cropper's or Blackadder's or Lord Ash's, either.
They seemed private.
I'm not explaining very well.’
‘No.
I suppose they might represent a considerable academic scoop.
For you.’
‘Well, I wanted to be the one who does the work,’ Roland began innocently, and then saw how he had been insulted.
‘Wait a minute — it wasn't like that at all, not like that.
It was something personal .
You wouldn't know.
I'm an old-fashioned textual critic, not a biographer — I don't go in for this sort of— it wasn't profit — I'll put them back next week — I wanted them to be a secret.
private.
And to do the work.’
She blushed.
Red blood stained the ivory.
‘I'm sorry.
I don't know why I should be; it was quite a reasonable assumption and I can't begin to imagine how anyone would dare to whip two manuscripts like that out of sight — I'd never have the nerve.
But I do see you weren't thinking in these terms.
I do really.’
‘I just wanted to know what happened next.’
‘I can't let you xerox Blanche's diary — the spine won't stand it — but you can copy it out.
And go on hunting through those boxes.
Who knows what you'll find.
No one was hunting for Randolph Henry Ash, after all.
Can I book you a guest room until tomorrow?’
Roland thought.
A guest room seemed infinitely attractive; a quiet place where he could sleep without Val, and think about Ash, and take himself at his own pace.
A guest room would cost money he hadn't got.
Also there was the Day Return.
‘I have a Day Return ticket.’
‘We could change that.’
‘I'd rather not.
I am an unemployed postgraduate.
I haven't got the money.’
Now she was wine-red.
‘I hadn't thought.
You'd better come back to my place.
I've got a spare bed.
It's still better than buying another ticket now you're here — I'll cook supper — and tomorrow you can look at the rest of the Archive.
It would be no trouble.’
He looked at the shiny black trace of the faded brown writing.
He said, ‘All right.
Maud lived on the ground floor of a red-brick Georgian house on the outskirts of Lincoln.
She had two large rooms, and a kitchen and bathroom constructed from what had been a warren of smaller domestic offices; her own front door had once been the tradesmen's entrance.
The university owned the house; the upper floors were university flats.
The kitchen, quarry-tiled, looked out onto a courtyard paved in red brick with various evergreen shrubs in tubs.
Maud's living room was not what might have been expected of a Victorian scholar.
It was bright white, paint, lamps and dining-table; the carpet was a Berber off-white.
The things in this room were brilliantly coloured in every colour, peacock, crimson, sunflower, deep rose, nothing pale or pastel.
Alcoves beside the fireplace held a collection of spotlit glass, bottles, flasks, paperweights.
Roland felt wakeful and misplaced, as though he was in an art gallery or a surgeon's waiting-room.
Maud went away to make supper, refusing offers of help, and Roland called the Putney flat where there was no reply.
Maud came through with a drink and said, ‘Why don't you read Tales for Innocents ?
I've got a first edition.’
The book was scuffed green leather, with faintly Gothic lettering.
Roland sat on Maud's huge white sofa, by the wood fire and turned the pages.
Now there was once a Queen, who might have been thought to have everything she could desire in the world, but had set her heart on a strange silent bird a traveller had told of, which lived in the snowy mountains, nested only once, raised its gold and silver chick, sang once only, and then faded like snow in the lowlands.
There was once a poor shoemaker who had three fine strong sons and two pretty daughters and a third, who could do nothing well, who shivered plates and tangled her spinning, who curdled milk, could not get butter to come, nor set a fire so that smoke did not pour into the room, a useless, hopeless, dreaming daughter, to whom her mother would often say that she should try to fend for herself in the wild wood, and then she would know the value of listening to advice, and of doing things properly.
And this filled the perverse daughter with a great desire to go even a little way into the wild wood, where there were no plates and no stitching, but might well be a need of such things as she knew she had it in herself to perform.
He looked at the woodcuts, which were described on the title page as ‘Illustrations by B.G.’ A female figure with a scarfed head, flying apron and great wooden shoes, standing in a clearing surrounded by dark pine trees full of white eyes among their crossing arms of needles.
Another figure wrapped in what appeared to be netting hung with little bells, beat netted fists against a cottage door whilst squashed, lumpen faces leered behind upper windows.
A little house, surrounded by the same black trees, at the foot of which, his chops on the whited steps, his sinuous length curved around its corner in a dragon-clasp, the long wolf lay, whose hairs were cut in harmony with the incisive feathering of the trees.
Maud Bailey gave him potted shrimps, omelette and green salad, some Bleu de Bresse and a bowl of sharp apples.
They talked about Tales for Innocents , which, Maud said, were mostly rather frightening tales derived from Grimm and Tieck, with an emphasis on animals and insubordination.
They looked together at the one about the woman who had said she would give anything for a child, of any kind, even a hedgehog, and had duly given birth to a monster, half-hedgehog, half-boy.
Blanche had drawn the hedgehog-child in a Victorian high chair at a Victorian table; behind it were dark panes of cupboard glass, before it a huge intruding hand, pointing to its dish.
Its face was blunt and furred and screwed up as though about to burst into tears.
Its prickles were round its ugly head like spined rays of a halo, and descended its neckless shoulders, criss-crossing, to meet the incongruity of a starched, frilled collar.
It had blunt little claws on its stubby hands.
Roland asked Maud what the critics made of this.
Maud said that Leonora Stern believed it represented Victorian women's fear, or any woman's fear, of giving birth to a monstrosity.
It was related to Frankenstein, the product of Mary Shelley's labour pains and horror of birth.
‘Do you think that?’
‘It's an old story, it's in Grimm, the hedgehog sits on a black cock in a high tree and plays the bagpipes and tricks people.
I think you can understand things about Christabel from the way she wrote her version.
I think she simply disliked children — the way many maiden aunts must have done, in those days.’
‘Blanche is sorry for the hedgehog.’
‘Is she?’
Maud examined the little picture.
‘Yes, you're right.
Christabel isn't.
It becomes a very resourceful swineherd — multiplies its pigs on forest acorns — and ends up with a lot of triumphant slaughter and roast pork and crackling.
Hard for modern children to stomach who grieve for the Gadarene swine.
Christabel makes it into a force of nature.
It likes winning, against the odds.
In the end it wins a King's daughter who is expected to bum its hedgehog-skin at night, and does so, and finds herself clasping a beautiful Prince, all singed and soot-black.
Christabel says, ‘And if he regretted his armoury of spines and his quick wild wits, history does not relate, for we must go no further, having reached the happy end.’
‘I like that.’
‘So do I.’
‘Did you start-work on her because of the family connection?’
‘Possibly.
I think not.
I knew one little poem by her, when I was very small, and it became a kind of touchstone.
The Baileys aren't very proud of Christabel, you know.
They aren't literary.
I'm a sport.
My Norfolk grandmother told me too much education spoilt a girl for a good wife.
And then the Norfolk Baileys don't speak to the Lincolnshire Baileys.
The Lincolnshire ones lost all their sons in the first World War, except one invalid one, and became rather impoverished, and the Norfolk Baileys hung on to a lot of the money.
Sophie LaMotte married a Lincolnshire Bailey.
So I didn't grow up with the idea that I had a poet in the family, by marriage of course.
Two Derby winners and an uncle who made a record ascent of the Eiger, that's the sort of thing that mattered .’
‘What was the little poem?’
‘The one about the Cumaean Sibyl.
It was in a little book I once got for Christmas called Ghosts and Other Weird Creatures .
I'll show you.’
He read
Who are you ?
Here on a high shelf
In webbed flask I
Hook up my folded self
Bat-leather dry.
Who were you ?
The gold god goaded me
Sang shrieking sang high
His heat corroded me
Not mine his cry.
What do you see ?
I saw the firmament
Steady the sky
I saw the cerement
Close Caesar's eye.
What do you hope ?
Desire is a dowsed fire
True love a lie
To a dusty shelf we aspire
I crave to die.
‘It's a very sad poem.’
‘Young girls are sad.
They like to be; it makes them feel strong.
The Sibyl was safe in her jar, no one could touch her, she wanted to die.
I didn't know what a Sibyl was.
I just liked the rhythm.
Anyway, when I started my work on thresholds it came back to me and so did she.
‘I wrote a paper on Victorian women's imagination of space.
Marginal Beings and Liminal Poetry .
About agoraphobia and claustrophobia and the paradoxical desire to be let out into unconfined space, the wild moorland, the open ground, and at the same time to be closed into tighter and tighter impenetrable small spaces — like Emily Dickinson's voluntary confinement, like the Sibyl's jar.
‘Like Ash's Sorceress in her In-Pace .’
‘That's different.
He's punishing her for her beauty and what he thought of as her wickedness.’
‘No, he isn't.
He's writing about the people, including herself, who thought she ought to be punished because of her beauty and wickedness.
She colluded with their judgment.
He doesn't.
He leaves it to our intelligence.’
A disputatious look crossed Maud's face, but all she said was, ‘And you?
Why do you work on Ash?’
‘My mother liked him.
She read English.
I grew up on his idea of Sir Walter Ralegh, and his Agincourt poem and Offa on the Dyke.
And then Ragnarök .’
He hesitated.
‘They were what stayed alive, when I'd been taught and examined everything else.’
Maud smiled then.
‘Exactly.
That's it.
What could survive our education.’
She made him up a bed on the high white divan in her living-room — not a heap of sleeping-bags and blankets but a real bed, with laundered sheets and pillows in emerald green cotton cases.
And a white down quilt, tumbled out of a concealed drawer beneath.
She found him a new toothbrush in its unbroken wrap, and said, ‘It's a pity about Sir George.
Being such a curmudgeon.
Who knows what he's got?
Have you ever seen Seal Court?
Victorian Gothic at its most tracery-like, pinnacles and lancets, deep in a dell.
We could drive out there.
If you think you've got time.
I very rarely feel any curiosity about Christabel's life — it's funny I even feel a sort of squeamishness about things she might have touched, or places she might have been — it's the language that matters, isn't it, it's what went on in her mind —’
‘Exactly —’
‘I've never bothered much about Blanche's Prowler and that sort of thing — it didn't seem to matter who it was, only that she thought something existed — but you've stirred something up —’
‘Look,’ he said.
He fetched the envelope out of his case.
‘I brought them with me.
After all, what else could I do with them?
They're faded but…’
Since our extraordinary conversation I have thought of nothing else…
I feel, I know with a certainty that cannot be the product of folly or misapprehension, that you and I must speak again —
‘I see,’ she said.
‘They're alive.’
‘They don't have ends.’
‘No.
They're beginnings.
Would you like to see where she lived?
And ended, indeed?’
He was visited by a memory of a cat-pissed ceiling, of a room with no view.
‘Why not?
Since I'm here.’
‘You go in the bathroom first.
Please.’
‘Thank you.
For everything.
Good night.’
He moved gingerly inside the bathroom, which was not a place to sit and read or to lie and soak, but a chill green glassy place, glittering with cleanness, huge dark green stoppered jars on water-green thick glass shelves, a floor tiled in glass tiles into whose brief and illusory depths one might peer, a shimmering shower curtain like a glass waterfall, a blind to match, over the window, full of watery lights.
Maud's great green-trellised towels were systematically folded on a towel-heater.
Not a speck of talcum powder, not a smear of soap, on any surface.
He saw his face in the glaucous basin as he cleaned his teeth.
He thought of his home bathroom, full of old underwear, open pots of eye paint, dangling shirts and stockings, sticky bottles of hair conditioner and tubes of shaving foam.
Later, Maud stood in there, turning her long body under the hot hiss of the shower.
Her mind was full of an image of a huge, unmade, stained and rumpled bed, its sheets pulled into standing peaks here and there, like the surface of whipped egg-white.
Whenever she thought of Fergus Wolff, this empty battlefield was what she saw.
Beyond it lay, if she had chosen to conjure them up, unwashed coffee cups, trousers lying where they had been stepped out of, heaped dusty papers ring-stained with wine-glasses, a carpet full of dust and ashes, the smell of socks and other smells.
Freud was right, Maud thought, vigorously rubbing her white legs, desire lies on the other side of repugnance.
The Paris conference where she had met Fergus had been on Gender and the Autonomous Text.
She had talked about thresholds and he had given an authoritative paper on ‘The Potent Castrato: the phallogocentric structuration of Balzac's hermaphrodite hero/ines’.
The drift of his argument appeared to be feminist.
The thrust of his presentation was somehow mocking and subversive.
He flirted with self-parody.
He expected Maud to come into his bed.
‘We two are the most intelligent people here, you know.
You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen or dreamed about.
I want you, I need you, can't you feel it, it's irresistible.’
Why it had been irresistible, Maud was not rationally sure.
But he had been right.
Then the arguments had begun.
Maud shivered.
She slipped on her nightdress, long-sleeved and practical, and loosed from her shower-cap all her yellow hair.
She brushed fiercely, supporting the fall, and considered her perfectly regular features in the mirror.
A beautiful woman, Simone Weil said, seeing herself in the mirror, knows ‘This is I.’ An ugly woman knows, with equal certainty, ‘This is not I.’Maud knew this neat division represented an over-simplification.
The doll-mask she saw had nothing to do with her, nothing.
The feminists had divined that, who once, when she rose to speak at a meeting, had hissed and cat-called, assuming her crowning glory to be the seductive and marketable product of an inhumanely tested bottle.
She had worn it almost shaved in her early teaching days, a vulnerable stubble on a white and shivering scalp.
Fergus had divined how afraid she was of the doll-mask and had dealt with it in his own way, daring her to let it all hang out, quoting Yeats at her in his Irish voice.
Never shall a young man
Thrown into despair
By those great honey-coloured
Ramparts at your ear
Love you for yourself alone
And not your yellow hair.
‘You should be ashamed to believe that,’ said Fergus, ‘and you so wise and clever about every other thing, my dear.’
‘I don't,’ Maud had said, ‘believe that or care.’
So he had dared her to grow it, and she had grown it, from eyebrow to ear to nape to the length of the neck to the shoulders.
The growing had lasted the affair, almost exactly; when they parted, the long queue knocked on her spine.
Now, for pride, she would not crop it, she would not so much mark the occasion, but instead wore it always inside some sort of covering, hidden away.
Roland felt buoyed up by the height of Maud's great divan.
The room smelled of the ghost of wine and a hint of cinnamon.
He lay in his white and emerald nest under the shaded light of a heavy brass lamp, green above, creamy inside.
There was an incapable sleeper somewhere in his mind, a sleeper bruised and tossing on heaped feather mattresses, the Real Princess, suffering the muffled pea.
Blanche Glover called Christabel the Princess.
Maud Bailey was a thin-skinned Princess.
He was an intruder into their female fastnesses.
Like Randolph Henry Ash.
He opened Tales for Innocents and read:
THE GLASS COFFIN
There was once a little tailor, a good and unremarkable man, who happened to be journeying through a forest, in search of work perhaps, for in those days men travelled great distances to make a meagre living, and the services of a fine craftsman, like our hero, were less in demand than cheap and cobbling hasty work that fitted ill and lasted only briefly.
He believed he should come across someone who should want his skills — he was an incurable optimist, and imagined a fortunate meeting around every corner, though how that should come about was hard to see, as he advanced farther and farther into the dark, dense trees, where even the moonlight was split into dull little needles of bluish light on the moss, not enough to see by.
But he did come upon the little house that was waiting for him, in a clearing in the depths, and was cheered by the lines of yellow light he could see between and under the shutters.
He knocked boldly on the door of this house, and there was a rustling, and creaking, and the door opened a tiny crack, and there stood a little man, with a face as grey as morning ashes, and a long woolly beard the same colour.
‘I am a traveller lost in the woods,’ said the little tailor, ‘and a master craftsman, seeking work, if any is to be found.’
‘I have no need for a master craftsman,’ said the little grey man.
‘And I am afraid of thieves.
You cannot come in here.’
‘If I were a thief I could have forced my way in, or crept secretly in,’ said the little tailor.
‘I am an honest tailor in need of help.’
Now behind the little man stood a great grey dog, as tall as he was, with red eyes and hot breath.
And at first this beast had made a low girning, growling sound, but now he hushed his threatening, and waved his tail slowly, and the little grey man said, ‘Otto is of the opinion that you are honest.
You may have a bed for the night in return for an honest evening's work, for help with cooking and cleaning and what must be prepared in my simple home.’
So the tailor was let in, and there was a strange household.
In a rocking chair stood a brilliantly coloured cockerel and his pure white wife.
In the fire-comer stood a black-and-white goat, with knobby little horns and eyes like yellow glass, and on the hearth lay a very large cat, a multi-coloured, mazy-patterned brindled cat, that looked up at the little tailor with eyes like cold green jewels, with black slits for pupils.
And behind the dining table was a delicate dun cow, with milky breath and a warm wet nose and enormous soft brown eyes.
‘Good morning,’ said the tailor, to this company, for he believed in good manners, and the creatures were surveying him in a judging and intelligent way.
‘Food and drink you will find in the kitchen,’ said the little grey man.
‘Make us a fit supper and we will eat together.’
So the little tailor turned to, and prepared a splendid pie, from flour and meat and onions he found there and decorated its top with beautifully formed pastry leaves and flowers, for he was a craftsman, even if he could not exercise his own craft.
And whilst it was cooking he looked about him, and brought hay to the cow and goat, golden corn to the cock and hen, milk to the cat and bones and meat from his cooking to the great grey dog.
And when the tailor and the little grey man were consuming the pie, whose warm smell filled the little house, the little grey man said, ‘Otto was right, you are a good and honest man, and you care — for all the creatures in this place, leaving no one unattended and nothing undone.
I shall give you a gift for your kindness.
Which of these things will you have?’
And he laid before the tailor three things.
The first was a little purse of soft leather, which clinked a little as he put it down.
The second was a cooking pot, black outside, polished and gleaming inside, solid and commodious.
And the third was a little glass key, wrought into fantastic fragile shape, and glittering with all the colours of the rainbow.
And the tailor looked at the watching animals for advice, and they all stared benignly back.
And he thought to himself, ‘I know about such gifts from forest people.
It may be that the first is a purse which is never empty, and the second a pot which provides a wholesome meal whenever you demand one in the right way.
I have heard of such things and met men who have been paid from such purses and eaten from such pots.
But a glass key I never saw or heard of and cannot imagine what use it might be; it would shiver in any lock.’
But he desired the little glass key, because he was a craftsman, and could see that it had taken masterly skill to blow all these delicate wards and barrel, and because he did not have any idea about what it was or might do, and curiosity is a great power in men's lives.
So he said to the little man, ‘I will take the pretty glass key.’
And the little man answered, ‘You have chosen not with prudence, but with daring.
The key is the key to an adventure, if you will go in search of it.’
‘Why not?’ replied the tailor.
‘Since there is no use for my craft in this wild place, and since I have not chosen prudently.’
Then the animals came closer with their warm, milky breaths that smelled sweetly of hay and the summer, and their mild comforting gaze that was not human, and the dog lay with his heavy head on the tailor's foot, and the brindled cat sat on the arm of his chair.
‘You must go out of this house,’ said the little grey man, ‘and call to the West Wind, and show her your key, when she comes, and let her carry you where she will, without struggle or alarm.
If you fight or question she will toss you on the thorns and it will go ill with you before you come out of there.
If she will take you, you will be set down in a bare heath, on a great stone, which is made of granite and is the gate to your adventure, though it will seem to have been fixed and unmoving since the making of the world.
On this stone you must lay a feather from the tail of the cockerel here, which he will willingly give you, and the door will be opened to you.
You must descend without fear, or hesitation, and descend further, and still descend; you will find that your glass key will shed light on your way if you hold it before you.
In time you will come to a stone vestibule, with two doors leading to branching passages you must not follow, and a low curtained door leading on and downwards.
You must not touch this curtain with your hand, but must lay on it the milk-white feather which the hen will give you, and the curtain will be opened silently, by unseen hands, and the doors beyond it will lie open, and you may come into the hall where you shall find what you shall find.’
‘Well, I will adventure,’ said the little tailor, ‘though I have great fear of the dark places under the earth, where there is no light of day and what is above is dense and heavy.’
So the cock and the hen allowed him to take a glistening burnished black and emerald feather and a soft creamy-white feather, and he bade them all good-bye and went into the clearing, and called to the West Wind, holding up his key.
And that was a delightful and most alarming sensation, when the long, airy arms of the West Wind reached down through the trees and caught him up, and the leaves were all shivering and clattering and trembling with her passing, and the straws danced before the house and the dust rose and flew about in little earth-fountains.
The trees grabbed at him with twiggy fingers as he rose up through them, lurching this way and that in the gusts, and then he felt himself held against the invisible rushing breast of the long Wind, as she hurled moaning along the sky.
He rested his face against his airy pillow, and did not cry out or struggle, and the sighing song of the West Wind, full of fine rain and glancing sunshine, streaming clouds and driven starlight, netted him around and around.
She put him down as the little grey man had foretold on a huge grey granite stone, pitted and scarred and bald.
He heard her whisking and wailing on her way, and he bent down and laid the cock-feather on the stone, and behold with a heavy groaning and grinding the huge stone swung up in the air and down in the earth, as though on a pivot or balance, disturbing waves of soil and heather like thick sea-water, and showing a dark, dank passage under the heather-roots and the knotty roots of the gorse.
So in he went, bravely enough, thinking all the time of the thickness of rock and peat and earth over his head, and the air in that place was chill and damp and the ground underfoot was moist and sodden.
He bethought him of his little key and held it up bravely before him, and it put out a little sparkling light that illumined a step at a time, silvery-pale.
So he came down to the vestibule, where the three doors were, and under the sills of the two great doors light shone, warm and enticing, and the third was behind a musty leather curtain.
He touched this leather, just brushing it with the tip of his soft hen feather, and it was drawn away in angular folds like bat-wings, and beyond a little dark door lay open into a tiny hole, into which he thought he might just manage to put his shoulders.
Then truly he was afraid, for his small grey friend had said nothing of this narrow little place, and he thought if he put his head in he might never come out alive.
So he looked behind himself and saw that the passage he had just come down was one of many, all wrinkled and wormy and dripping and tangled with roots, and he thought he could never find his way back so he must perforce push on and see what lay in store.
It took all the courage he had to thrust his head and shoulders into the mouth of that entrance, but he closed his eyes and twisted and turned and after a time tumbled out into a great stone chamber, lit with a soft light of its own that dimmed the glitter of his shining key.
It was a miracle he thought, that the glass had not shivered in that tight struggle, but it was as clear and brittle as ever.
So he looked about him, and saw three things.
The first was a heap of glass bottles and flasks, all of them covered with dust and cobwebs.
The second was a glass dome, the size of a man, and a little taller than our hero.
And the third was a shining glass coffin, lying on a rich velvet pall on a gilded trestle.
And from all these things the soft light proceeded, like the glimmering of pearls in the depth of water, like the phosphorescent light that moves of itself on the night surface of southern seas, or shines round the heaving shoals, milky-white over their silver darts, in our own dark Channel.
Well, he thought, one or all of these is my adventure.
He looked at the bottles, which were many colours, red and green and blue and smoky topaz, and contained wisps and rinsings of nothing much, a sigh of smoke in one, a rocking of spirituous liquid in another.
All were corked and sealed, and he was too circumspect to break the seals till he saw better where he was and what was to do.
He moved on to the dome, which you must imagine like the magic covers you have seen in your drawing-room under which dwell all sorts of brilliant little birds, as natural as life on their branches, or flights of mysterious moths and butterflies.
Or maybe you have seen a crystal ball containing a tiny house which you can shake to produce a brilliant snowstorm?
This dome contained a whole castle, set in a beautiful park, with trees and terraces and gardens, fishpools and climbing roses, and bright banners hanging limp in its many turrets.
It was a brave and beautiful place, with innumerable windows and twisting staircases and a lawn and a swing in a tree and everything you could desire in a spacious and desirable residence, only that it was all still and tiny enough to need a magnifying glass to see the intricacies of its carvings and appurtenances.
The little tailor, as I have told you, was first and foremost a craftsman, and he stared in wonder at this beautiful model and could not begin to imagine what fine tools or instruments had carved and wrought it.
He dusted it a little, to marvel better, and then moved on to the glass coffin.
Have you remarked, where a fast-flowing stream comes to a little fall, how the racing water becomes glassy smooth and under it the long fine threads of the water-weed are drawn along in its still-seeming race, trembling a little, but stretched out in the flow?
So under the surface of the thick glass lay a mass of long gold threads, filling in the whole cavity of the box with their turns and tumbles, so that at first the little tailor thought he had come upon a box full of spun gold, to make cloth of gold.
But then between the fronds he saw a face, the most beautiful face he could have dreamed of or imagined, a still white face, with long gold lashes on pale cheeks, and a perfect pale mouth.
Her gold hair lay round her like a mantle, but where its strands crossed her face they stirred a little with her breathing, so that the tailor knew she was alive.
And he knew — it is always so, after all — that the true adventure was the release of this sleeper, who would then be his grateful bride.
But she was so beautiful and peaceful that he was half-loath to disturb her.
He wondered how she had come there, and how long she had been there, and what her voice would be like, and a thousand other ridiculous things, whilst she breathed in and out, ruffling the gold threads of hair.
And then he saw, in the side of the smooth box, which had no visible cleft or split, but was whole like a green ice egg, a tiny keyhole.
And he knew that this was the keyhole for his wondrous delicate key, and with a little sigh he put it in and waited for what should ensue.
And the little key slipped into the keyhole and melted, as it seemed into the glass body of the casket, so for a moment the whole surface was perfectly closed and smooth.
And then, in a very orderly way, and with a strange bell-like tinkling, the coffin broke into a collection of long icicle splinters, that rang and vanished as they touched the earth.
And the sleeper opened her eyes, which were as blue as periwinkle, or the summer sky, and the little tailor, because he knew this was what he must do, bent and kissed the perfect cheek.
‘You must be the one,’ said the young woman, ‘You must be the one I have been waiting for, who must release me from enchantment.
You must be the Prince.’
‘Ah no,’ said our hero, ‘there you are mistaken.
I am no more and indeed no less — than a fine craftsman, a tailor, in search of work for my hands, honest work, to keep me alive.’
Then the young woman laughed merrily, her voice strengthening after what must have been years of silence, and the whole strange cellar rang with that laughter, and the glass fragments tinkled like broken bells.
‘You shall have enough and more than enough, to keep you alive forever, if you help me out of this dark place,’ she said.
‘Do you see that beautiful castle locked in glass?’
‘Indeed I do, and marvel at the craft with which it was made.’
‘That was no carver's or miniaturist's craft, but black magic, for that was the castle in which I lived, and the forests and meadows round it were mine, where I roamed freely, with my beloved brother, until the black artist came one night seeking shelter from foul weather.
For you must know that I had a twin brother, as beautiful as the day, and gentle as a fawn, and wholesome as new bread and butter, whose company pleased me so much, as mine also pleased him, that we swore an oath never to marry but to live forever peacefully in the castle, and hunt and play together the livelong day.
But when this stranger knocked, in a howling gale, with his wet hat and cloak pouring rainwater and his smiling mouth, my brother invited him in eagerly, and gave him meat and wine, and a bed for the night, and sang with him, and played cards, and sat by the fire, talking of the wide world and its adventures.
As I was not pleased with this, and indeed a little sorrowful that my brother should take pleasure in another's company, I went to bed early and lay listening to the West Wind howling round the turrets and after a while fell into an uneasy slumber.
From this I was wakened by a strange, very beautiful twanging music, coming from all about me.
I sat up, and tried to see what this might be or mean, and saw the door of my chamber slowly open and he, the stranger, came striding in, dry now, with black curly hair and a dangerous smiling face.
I tried to move, but could not, it was as though a band gripped my body, and another band was tied about my face.
He told me that he meant me no harm, but was a magician, who had made the music play around me, and wished to have my hand in marriage and live in my castle, with me and my brother, in peace hereafter.
And I said — for I was permitted to answer — that I had no desire for marriage, but wished to live unwed and happy with my dear brother and no other.
So he answered that that might not be, that he would have me whether I would or no, and that my brother was of his opinion in this matter.
We shall see that, said I, and he answered unabashed, with the invisible instruments twanging and humming and jangling all over the room, ‘You may see it, but you must not speak about this or anything that has passed here, for I have silenced you as surely as if I had cut out your tongue.’
‘Next day I tried to warn my brother, and it was as the black artist had said.
When I opened my mouth to speak on this topic it was as though my lips were sewn together with great stitches in the flesh, and my tongue would not move in my mouth.
Yet I might ask to have the salt passed, or discourse of the evil weather, and so my brother, to my great chagrin, noticed nothing, but set out blithely to go hunting with his new friend, leaving me at home to sit by the hearth, and to feel silent anguish at what might ensue.
All day I sat so, and in the late afternoon, when the shadows were long on the castle lawns and the last rays of the sun were brassy and chill, I knew with certainty that something terrible had happened, and ran out of the castle, and away to the dark woods.
And out of the dark woods came the black man, leading his horse on one arm, and on the other a tall grey hound with the saddest face I have ever seen on any creature.
He told me my brother had suddenly gone away, and would return no more for a great and uncertain length of time and had left me, and the castle, in charge of him, the dark magician.
He told me this gaily, as if it did not much matter whether I believed it or no.
I said I would by no means submit to such injustice and was glad to hear my own voice steady and confident, for I feared my lips might again be sewn into silence.
When I spoke great tears fell from the eyes of the grey hound, more and more, heavier and heavier.
And I knew in some sort, I think, that the animal was my brother, in this meek and helpless form.
Then I was angry, and said he should never come into my house, nor come near me, with my good will.
And he said that I had perceived correctly, that he might do nothing without my goodwill which he would strive to gain, if I would allow it.
And I said, this should never be, and he must never hope for it.
Then he became angry, and threatened that he would silence me forever, if I would not agree.
I said that without my dear brother I had little care where I was, and no one I wished to speak to.
Then he said I should see whether that was so after a hundred years in a glass coffin.
He made a few passes and the castle diminished and shrank, as you see it now, and he made a pass or two more and it was walled with glass as you see.
And my people, the men and maidservants who came running, he confined as you see, each in a glass bottle, and finally closed me into the glass coffin in which you found me.
And now, if you will have me, we will hasten from this place, before the magician returns, as he does from time to time, to see if I have relented.’
‘Of course I will have you,’ said the little tailor, ‘for you are my promised marvel, released with my vanished glass key, and I love you dearly already.
Though why you should have me, simply because I opened the glass case, is less clear to me altogether, and when, and if, you are restored to your rightful place, and your home and lands and people are again your own, I trust you will feel free to reconsider the matter, and remain, if you will, alone and unwed.
For me, it is enough to have seen the extraordinary gold web of your hair, and to have touched that whitest and most delicate cheek with my lips.’
And you may ask yourselves, my dear and most innocent readers, whether he spoke there with more gentleness or cunning, since the lady set such store on giving herself of her own free will, and since also the castle with its gardens, though now measurable with pins and fine stitches and thumbnails and thimbles, were lordly and handsome enough for any man to wish to spend his days there.
The beautiful lady then blushed, a warm and rosy colour in her white cheeks, and was heard to murmur that the spell was as the spell was, that a kiss received after the successful disintegration of the glass casket, was a promise, as kisses are, whether received voluntarily or involuntarily.
Whilst they were thus disputing, politely, the moral niceties of their interesting situation, a rushing sound was heard, and a melodious twanging, and the lady became very agitated, and said the black magician was on his way.
And our hero in his turn, felt despondent and fearful, for his little grey mentor had given him no instructions for this eventuality.
‘Still, he thought, I must do what I can to protect the lady, to whom I owe so much, and whom I have certainly, for better, for worse, released from sleep and silence.
He carried no weapon save his own sharp needles and scissors, but it occurred to him that he could make do with the slivers of glass from the broken sarcophagus.
So he took up the longest and sharpest, wrapping its hilt round in his leather apron, and waited.
The black artist appeared on the threshold, wrapped in a swirling black cloak, smiling most ferociously, and the little tailor quaked and held up his splinter, thinking his foe would be bound to meet it magically, or freeze his hand in motion as he struck.
But the other merely advanced, and when he came up, put out a hand to touch the lady, whereupon our hero struck with all his might at his heart, and the glass splinter entered deeply and he fell to the ground.
And behold, he shrivelled and withered under their eyes, and became a small handful of grey dust and glass powder.
Then the lady wept a little, and said that the tailor had now twice saved her, and was in every way worthy of her hand.
And she clapped her hands together, and suddenly they all rose in the air, man, woman, house, glass flasks, heap of dust, and found themselves out on a cold hillside where stood the original little grey man with Otto the hound.
And you, my sagacious readers, will have perceived and understood that Otto was the very same hound into which the young brother of the lady of the coffin had been transformed.
So she fell upon his grey hairy neck, weeping bright tears.
And when her tears mixed with the salty tears that fell down the great beast's cheek, the spell was released, and he stood before her, a golden-haired young man in hunting-costume.
And they embraced, for a long time, with full hearts.
Meanwhile the little tailor, aided by the little grey man, had stroked the glass case containing the castle with the two feathers from the cock and hen, and with a strange rushing and rumbling the castle appeared as it must always have been, with noble staircases and innumerable doors.
Then the little tailor and the little grey man uncorked the bottles and flasks and the liquids and smokes flowed sighing out of the necks of them, and formed themselves into men and women, butler and forester, cook and parlourmaid, all mightily bewildered to find themselves where they were.
Then the lady told her brother that the little tailor had rescued her from her sleep and had killed the black artist and had won her hand in marriage.
And the young man said that the tailor had offered him kindness, and should live with them both in the castle and be happy ever after.
And so it was, and they did live happily ever after.
The young man and his sister went hunting in the wild woods, and the little tailor, whose inclination did not lie that way, stayed by the hearth and was merry with them in the evenings.
Only one thing was missing.
A craftsman is nothing without the exercise of his craft.
So he ordered to be brought to him the finest silk cloth and brilliant threads, and made for pleasure what he had once needed to make for harsh necessity.
CHAPTER FIVE
The ploughman, turning sullen clods may see
(Air whistling in his brain that rose in sighs
From belly griped by famine) the soil work
And work, to extrude a demon, with knobbed brow
And golden eyes, that opens a brown mouth
To promise — not the dream of avarice —
But pots of gold to buy the pots of pulse
Of which, no more, he dreams.
So she may feel
Whisk past her skirt and scamper, hairy feet
Of an old gentle godling, who leaves tracks
In the warm ashes, or whose grincing voice
Laughs even in the cradle, saying ‘Love me,
Rock me, and find your treasure, never fear.
The old gods keep their gifts to give their own.’
From such small demons, what harm might they fear?
R. H. Ash, from The Incarcerated Sorceress 
The wolds of Lincolnshire are a small surprise.
Tennyson grew up in one of their tight twisting valleys.
From them he made the cornfields of immortal Camelot.
On either side the river lie
Long fields of barley and of rye
That clothe the wold and meet the sky.
Roland saw immediately that the word ‘meet’ was precise and surprising, not vague.
They drove over the plain, up the rolling road, out of the valley.
The valleys are deep and narrow, some wooded, some grassy, some ploughed.
The ridges run sharply across the sky, always bare.
The rest of the large, sleepy county is marsh or fen or flat farmed plain.
These slightly rolling hills appear to be folded out of the surface of the earth, but that is not the case; they are part of a dissected tableland.
The villages are buried in the valleys, at the end of blind funnels.
The green car went busily along the ridgeway, which was patterned with roads and paths like the branches of spines.
Roland, who was urban, noted colours; dark ploughed earth, with white chalk in the furrows; a pewter sky, with chalk-white clouds.
Maud noticed good rides and unmended gates, and badly crunched hedgerows, gnashed by machine-teeth.
‘Down on the left,’ she said.
‘Seal Court.
In the hollow.’
A carpet of treetops, not homogeneous, and a glimpse of battlements, a round turret, another turn, and a sort of keep, perhaps.
‘The land's private, of course.
We can go down into the village.
Christabel's buried there.
In St Etheldreda's churchyard.
The village is called Croysant le Wold; it's a lost village, more or less — there are a lot of lost villages scattered round the feet of these hills, no more than a grange and a church still standing.
I don't think the Croysant church is in use nowadays.
Christabel thought Croysant was derived from Croyance, meaning belief, and Saint — but it was one of those inaccurate guessing nineteenth-century etymologies.
They say it really came from Croissant, meaning crescent, because there's a bend in the valley and the river there.
She liked St Etheldreda, who was a Virgin Queen, although she was twice married — she became Abbess of Ely and founded a great House, and was buried in the odour of sanctity —’
Roland was not very interested in St Etheldreda.
This morning Maud seemed again remote and patronising.
They descended the switchback road and turned off in the valley towards the church; which stood in its walled graveyard, solid, square-towered.
Outside its gate a battered estate-car was parked; Maud drew up at a distance, and together they walked in.
The earth was wet.
Blackening beech leaves, from a tree near the gate, clogged the path through the little graveyard, which was overgrown with damp, dun hay.
Flanking the heavy stone porch were two large yews, heavy-shadowed.
Maud, sensible in trench-coat and wellingtons, her head still scarfed, strode up to the wrought-iron gate across the porch, which was bolted and padlocked.
Water, containing a brilliant green sediment, dripped from a gutter onto the stone, leaving a sinuous stain.
‘The Baileys are in the church,’ said Maud.
‘But Christabel's out on the edge, in the wind and the rain, where she wanted to be.
Over here.’
They clambered over tussocks and humps.
They put their feet in the rabbit-runs between the dead.
There was a shoulder-high stone wall, rooted with ivy-leaved toadflax.
Christabel's tombstone leaned over at a slight angle.
It was made of local limestone, not marble, and roughened by weather.
Someone had cleaned the lettering, not very recently.
Here lie the mortal remains of Christabel Madeleine LaMotte Younger daughter of Isidore LaMotte Historian And of his beloved wife Arabel LaMotte Only sister of Sophie, Lady Bailey Wife of Sir George Bailey of Seal Court Croysant le Wold
Born January 3rd 1825 Laid to rest May 8th 1890
After mortal trouble Let me lie still Where the wind drives and the clouds stream Over the hill Where grass's thousand thirsty mouths Sup up their fill Of the slow dew and the sharp rain Of the mantling snow dissolv'd again At Heaven's sweet will.
Someone, again not recently, had sheared the hay from the grave, which was surrounded by a low and crumbling stone rim, thrust apart by couch grass and thorny trails of bramble.
On the grassy mound lay the ghost of a large, indeed opulent bouquet, held together by bridal wires, now rusted amongst the mop heads of dead chrysanthemums and carnations, the skeletal leaves of long-faded roses.
A green satin ribbon, water-stained and earth-stained, held these fragments together; there was a card tied to this, on which was palely visible in typewriting
For Christabel From the women of Tallahassee Who truly honour you Who keep your memory green And continue your work ‘The stones I shaped endure.’
Melusina , XII, 325
‘Leonora was here,’ said Maud.
‘In the summer.
When Sir George threatened her with a shotgun.’
‘She had a go at the weeds perhaps,’ said Roland, who felt threatened by damp and melancholy.
‘Leonora would be very shocked at the state of this graveyard,’ said Maud.
‘She would not find it romantic.
I think it's all right.
A slow return to nature and oblivion.’
‘Did Christabel write that poem?’
‘It's one of her quieter efforts.
You see it's not ascribed.
The tombstone mentions her father's profession, and doesn't say a word about her own.’
Roland felt briefly guilty of the oppressions of mankind.
He said mildly, ‘It's the poem that sticks in the memory.
Rather sinister.’
‘As though the grass were supping up Christabel.’
‘Well, it was, I suppose.’
They looked at the grass.
It lay damply, in decaying tufts.
‘Let's walk up the hill,’ said Maud.
‘We can look down on Seal Court from a distance.
She must have come this way often enough, she was a diligent churchgoer.’
From behind the church a ploughed field slanted up to the uncompromising skyline.
Silhouetted against the grey sky, on the top, was a figure Roland at first took for a seated monarch by Henry Moore, enthroned and crowned.
Then it inclined its head and struggled fiercely with arms pointing earthwards, and Roland caught glints of silver and reconstituted it as a person in a wheel-chair, possibly in difficulty.
‘Look!’ he said to Maud.
Maud stared upwards.
‘Perhaps they're in trouble.’
‘Someone must be with them or they wouldn't have got up there,’ said Maud reasonably.
‘Perhaps,’ said Roland, setting off nevertheless, his town shoes thickening with mud as he climbed, his hair ruffling.
He was in good health, owing to the cycling perhaps, despite carbon monoxide and lead in London streets.
In the wheelchair was a woman, wearing a deep-crowned, wide-brimmed green felt hat, obscuring her face, and a paisley silk scarf at the throat of a caped loden coat.
The chair had spun out of the central track along the ridge and was now skewed at the precipitous edge of what would be a steep and stony career.
Leather-gloved hands strove with the huge hoops.
Leather boots, beautifully soft and polished, rested placidly on the shifting step.
There was, Roland saw, a huge flint embedded in the mud under the back of the wheel, preventing all attempts at manoeuvre or reversal.
‘Can I help?’
‘Oh,’ on a long stressed sigh.
‘Oh, thank you.
I do s-seem to be b-bogged down.’
The voice was hesitant, old and patrician.
‘S-such a b-bother.
So so h-h-h-h- helpless .
If you please —’‘There's a stone.
Under the wheel.
Wait.
Hold on.’
He had to kneel down in the muddy track, damaging his trousers, reminding him of playground agonies; he gripped, tugged, balanced.
‘Is the chair stable?’ he said.
‘I seem to be tipping you.’
‘It's d-designed for s-stability.
I have the brakes on.’
The full real anxiety of the position slowly came over Roland.
Any wrong move, and she would have been over.
He inserted his hands into the mud, and scrabbled.
He found a not very effective twig and scraped.
He used another flint as a primitive lever and finally fell back, clasping the offending object in both hands, damaging the haunches of his trousers too.
‘There,’ he said.
‘Like dentistry.
It's out.’
‘I am very grateful.’
‘You were in a bit of a fix.
You must have skidded over it one way and then it tipped back and put up this sort of tooth, like a ratchet, look.’
He became aware that she was trembling.
‘No, wait a minute, let's get the chair back on the track.
I'm afraid my hands are muddy.’
He was out of breath by the time he had canted her back, ground her round, settled the chair on the rough track again.
Its wheels dripped mud.
She turned her face up to him then.
It was — large and moony, stained with the brown coins of age, thick with ropes and soft pockets of flesh under the chin.
The eyes, huge and pale brown, were swimming.
From under the smooth, pulled-back grey hair at the sides of the hat, trickled large drops of sweat.
‘Thank you,’ she said.
‘I had got myself in a very foolish position.
I might well have gone over.
F-foolhardy, my husband would say.
I sh-should s-stay on the level ground.
My dependence annoys me.’
‘Of course,’ said Roland.
‘Of course it must.
You were all right really.
Someone must have come.’
‘Just as well you did.
Are you out walking?’
‘I'm visiting.
Out with a friend.’
Where was Maud?
‘Marvellous air.
You can see so far.’
‘That's why I come up here.
The dog is meant to stay with me, but he never does.
My husband likes to poke about in the woods.
Where are you walking?’
‘I don't know.
My friend knows.
Shall I walk with you, a little?’
‘I don't feel very well.
My h-hands are shaky.
If you would be good enough to come to — the foot of the track, down the wold, my husband —’
‘Of course, of course .’
Maud came up.
She looked neat and clean in her Burberry and wellingtons.
‘We got the chair out,’ Roland told her.
‘It was jammed on a stone.
I'm just going to walk down the hill with this lady — her husband's there — she's had rather a shock —’
‘Of course,’ said Maud.
They progressed, all three, Roland behind the chair, down the track.
The land over the hill was thickly wooded.
Through trees Roland saw again, more leisurely, a turret, a battlement, white in the gloom.
‘Seal Court,’ he said to Maud.
‘Yes.’
‘Romantic,’ he offered.
‘Dark and damp’ said the lady in the wheelchair.
‘It must have cost a fortune to build,’ said Maud.
‘And to maintain,’ said the lady in the wheelchair.
Her leather hands danced a little in her lap, but her voice was steadying.
‘I suppose so,’ said Roland.
‘You are interested in old houses?’
‘Not exactly,’ said Roland.
‘We wanted to see that one.’
‘Why?’
Maud's boot sliced into his ankle.
He suppressed an exclamation of pain.
A very dirty Labrador appeared, out of the woodland.
‘Ah, Much,’ said the lady.
‘There you are.
Useless great lump.
Useless.
Where's your master?
Tracking badgers?’
The dog measured its blond belly in the mud, agitating its stern.
‘Tell me your names,’ said the lady in the wheelchair.
Maud said quickly, ‘This is Dr Michell.
From London University.
I teach at Lincoln University.
My name's Bailey.
Maud Bailey.’
‘My name is Bailey too.
Joan Bailey.
I live at Seal Court.
Are you a relation?’
‘I am a Norfolk Bailey.
A relation far back.
Not very close.
The families haven't kept up.’
Maud sounded repressive and cold.
‘How interesting.
Ah, here is George.
George dear, I have had an adventure and been rescued by a knight.
I was entrenched on the top of Eagle's Piece, with a huge stone under my wheel and the only way out seemed to be over the edge,most humiliating.
And then Mr Michell here came along, and this young woman, whose name is Bailey.’
‘I told you to keep to the centre of the track.’
Sir George was small and wet and bristling.
He had laced leather boots with polished rounded calves, like greaves.
He had a many-pocketed shooting jacket, brown, with a flat brown tweed cap.
He barked.
Roland took him for a caricature and bristled vestigially with class irritation.
Such people, in his and Val's world, were not quite real but still walked the earth.
Maud too saw him as a type; in her case he represented the restriction and boredom of countless childhood country weekends of shooting and tramping and sporting conversation.
Rejected and evaded.
He was not carrying a gun.
Water stained his shoulders, shone on his footwear, stood in drops on the furry ribs of the socks between his breeches and his boots.
He considered his wife.
‘You're never content, are you?’ he said.
‘I push you up the hill and then you're not content to take it steady on the track, oh no.
Any harm done?’
‘I do feel a bit shaken.
Mr Michell came in time.’
‘Well, you weren't to expect that.’
He advanced on Roland, his hand held out.
‘I'm very grateful.
My name's Bailey.
The idiot dog is meant to stay with Joan, but he will not, he will go off on his own little expeditions in the gorse.
I expect you think I should have stayed up there, ha?’
Roland demurred, touching his forthright hand, stepping back.
‘So I should.
So I should.
I'm a selfish old blighter.
There are badgers, though, Joanie.
Not that I should say so, encourage trespassers, wildlifers, terrifying the poor brutes out of their wits.
The old Japanese juniper's in good fettle, too, you'll be glad to know.
Quite recovered.’
He advanced on Maud.
‘Afternoon.
My name's Bailey.’
‘She knows,’ said his wife.
‘So's her name, I told you, she's one of the Norfolk Baileys.’
‘Is that so?
They aren't seen about here very often.
Less than badgers, I'd say.
What brings you here?’
‘I work in Lincoln.’
‘You do, do you?’
He did not ask at what.
He considered his wife with some intensity of observation.
You look clammy, Joan.
You aren't a good colour.
We should get you home.’
‘I should like to ask Mr Michell and Miss Bailey to c-come to t-tea if they would.
Mr Michell needs a wash.
They are interested in Seal Court.’
‘Seal Court isn't interesting,’ said Sir George.
‘It isn't open to the public, you know.
It's in a bad way.
My fault, indirectly.
Lack of funds.
Coming down round our ears.’
‘They won't mind that.
They're young.’
Lady Bailey's large face took on a set expression.
‘I should like to ask them.
For courtesy.’
Maud's face flamed.
Roland saw what was going on.
She wanted proudly to disclaim any interest in penetrating Seal Court: she wanted to go there, because of Christabel, because, he guessed, Leonora Stern had been turned away: she felt, he assumed, dishonest in not saying straight out why she had an interest in going.
‘I should be very glad of a brief chance to wash,’ he said.
‘If it's not too much trouble.’
They drove in convoy round behind the great house, on a sopping weed-infested gravel drive, and pulled up in the stable-yard, where Roland helped Sir George to disembark the wheelchair and Lady Bailey.
The short day was darkening; the back door swung in heavily under a Gothic porch over which a rose, now leafless, was trained.
Above, rows of dark windows, with carved Gothic frames, were dark and blank.
The door had been elongated to remove steps, so that the wheelchair could go in.
They progressed along dark stone corridors, past various pantries and flights of steps, arriving eventually in what later turned out to have been the servants' hall and was now superficially, and partially, converted for modern living.
At one end of this dim room was an open fireplace, in which a few huge logs still smouldered in a bed of white ash; on either side of this were two heavy, curved and padded armchairs, covered in velvet, a dark charcoal colour, pattered with dark purple flowers, a kind of glamorised fin-de-siècle bindweed.
The floor was covered with large red and white vinyl tiles, rubbed in ridges that betrayed the presence of flagstones underneath.
Under the window was a heavy table, thick-legged and partly covered with an oilcloth patterned in faintly tartan checks.
At the other-end of the room, which later proved to lead out to the kitchen and other domestic offices, was a small two-barred electric fire.
There were other, slightly threadbare chairs, and a collection of extremely glossy, lively pot plants, in glazed bowls.
Maud was worried by the lighting, which Sir George turned on — a dim standard lamp by the fire, a slightly happier lamp, made from a Chinese vase, on the table.
The walls were whitewashed, and bore various pictures of horses, dogs and badgers, oils, water-colours, tinted photos, framed glossy prints.
By the fire was a huge basket, obviously Much's bed, lined with a stiff and hair-strewn navy blanket.
Large areas of the room were simply empty.
Sir George drew the curtains, and motioned Roland and Maud to sit down by the fire, in the velvet chairs.
Then he wheeled his wife out.
Roland did not feel able to ask if he could help.
He had expected a butler or some obsequious manservant, at the least a maid or companion, to welcome them into a room shining with silver and silk carpets.
Maud, inured to poor heating and the threadbare, was still a little disturbed by the degree of discomfort represented by the sad lighting.
She put her hand down and called Much, who came and pressed his body, trembling and filthy, against her legs, between her and the sinking fire.
Sir George came back and built up his fire with new logs, hissing and singing.
Joan is making tea.
I'm afraid we don't have too many comforts or luxuries here.
We live only on the ground floor, of course.
I had the kitchen made over for Joan.
Every possible aid.
Doors and ramps.
All that could be done.
I know it's not much.
This house was built to be run by a pack of servants.
Two old folk — we echo in it.
But I keep up the woods.
And Joan's garden.
There's a Victorian water garden too, you know.
She likes that.’
‘I've read about that,’ said Maud cautiously.
‘Have you now?
Keep up with family things, do you?’
‘In a way.
I have particular family interests.’
‘What relation are you to Tommy Bailey then?
That was a great horse of his, Hans Andersen, that was a horse with character and guts.’
‘He was my great-uncle.
I used to ride one of Hans Andersen's less successful descendants.
A pig-headed brute who could jump himself out of anything, like a cat, but didn't always choose to, and didn't always take me with him.
Called Copenhagen.’
They talked about horses and a little about the Norfolk Baileys.
Roland watched Maud making noises which he sensed came naturally, and sensed too that she would never make in the Women's Studies building.
From the kitchen a bell struck.
‘That's the tea.
I'll go and fetch it.
And Joan.’
It came in an exquisite Spode tea service, with a silver sugar-bowl and a plateful of hot buttered toast with Gentleman's Relish or honey, on a large melamine tray designed, Roland saw, to slot into the arms of the wheelchair.
Lady Bailey poured.
Sir George quizzed Maud about dead cousins, long-dead horses, and the state of the trees on the Norfolk estate.
Joan Bailey said to Roland, ‘George's great-great-grandfather planted all this woodland, you know.
Partly for timber, partly because he loved trees.
He tried to get everything to grow that he could.
The rarer the tree, the more of a challenge.
George keeps it up.
He keeps them alive.
They're not fast conifers, they're mixed woodland, some of those rare trees are very old.
Woods are diminishing in this part of the world.
And hedges too.
We've lost acres and acres of woodland to fast grain farming.
George goes up and down protecting his trees.
Like some old goblin.
Somebody has to have a sense of the history of things.’
‘Do you know,’ said Sir George, ‘that up to the eighteenth century the major industry in this part of the world was rabbit-warrening?
The land wasn't fit for much else, sandy, full of gorse.
Lovely silver skins they had; they went off to be hats in London and up North.
Fed 'em in the winter, let 'em forage in the summer, neighbours complained but they flourished.
Alternated with sheep in places.
Vanished, along with much else.
They found ways to make sheep cheaper, and corn too, and the rabbits died out.
Trees going the same way now.’
Roland could think of no intelligent comments about rabbits, but Maud replied with statistics about Fenland warrens and a description of an old warrener's tower on the Norfolk Baileys' estate.
Sir George poured more tea.
Lady Bailey said, ‘And what do you do in London, Mr Michell?’
‘I'm a university research student.
I do some teaching.
I'm working for an edition of Randolph Henry Ash.’
‘He wrote a good poem we learned at school,’ said Sir George.
‘Never had any use for poetry myself, but I used to like that one.
‘The Hunter’.
Do you know that poem?
About a stone-age chappie setting snares and sharpening flints and talking to his dog and snuffing the weather in the air.
You got a real sense of danger from that poem.
Funny way to spend your life, though, studying another chap's versifying.
We had a sort of poet in this house once.
I expect you'd think nothing to her.
Terrible sentimental stuff about God and Death and the dew and fairies.
Nauseating.’
‘Christabel LaMotte,’ said Maud.
Just so.
Funny old bird.
Lately we get people round asking if we've got any of her stuff.
I send them packing.
We keep ourselves to ourselves, Joan and I. There was a frightful nosy American in the summer who just turned up out of the blue and told us how honoured we must be, having the old bat's relics up here.
Covered with paint and jangling jewellery, a real mess, she was.
Wouldn't go when I asked her politely.
Had to wave the gun at her.
Wanted to sit in Joan's winter garden.
To remember Christabel.
Such rot.
Now a real poet, like your Randolph Henry Ash, that'd be something different, you'd be reasonably pleased to have someone like that in the family.
Lord Tennyson was a bit of a soppy old thing too, on the whole, though he wrote some not bad things about Lincolnshire dialect.
Not a patch on Mabel Peacock though.
She really could hear Lincolnshire speech.
Marvellous story about a hedgehog.
‘Th'otchin 'at wasn't niver suited wi' nowt.
Listen to this then.
Fra fo'st off he was werrittin' an witterin' an sissin an spittin perpetiwel.’
That's real history that is, words that are vanishing daily, fewer and fewer people learning them, all full of Dallas and Dynasty and the Beatles jingle jangle.’
‘Mr Michell and Miss Bailey will think you are a frightful old stick, George.
They like good poetry.’
‘They don't like Christabel LaMotte.’
‘Ah, but I do,’ said Maud.
‘It was Christabel who wrote the description I read of the Seal Court winter garden.
In a letter.
She made me see it, and the different evergreens, and the red berries and the dogwood and the sheltered bench and the silvery fish in the little pool…
Even under the ice she could see them suspended —’
‘We had an old tom cat who used to take the fish —’
‘We restocked —’
‘I'd love to see the winter garden.
I'm writing about Christabel LaMotte.’
‘Ah,’ said Lady Bailey.
‘A biography.
How interesting.’
‘I don't see,’ said Sir George, ‘that there'd be much to put in a biography.
She didn't do anything.
Just lived up there in the east wing and poured out all this stuff about fairies.
It wasn't a life .’
‘As a matter of fact, it isn't a biography.
It's a critical study.
But of course she interests me.
We went to look at her grave.’
This was the wrong thing to say.
Sir George's face darkened.
His brows, which were sandy, drew down over his plummy nose.
‘That unspeakable female who came here — she had the impudence to hector me — to read me a lecture — on the state of that grave.
Said its condition was shocking.
A national monument.
Not her national monument I told her, and she shouldn't come poking her nose in where it wasn't wanted.
She asked to borrow some shears.
That was when I got the gun out.
So she went and bought some in Lincoln and came back the next day and got down on her knees and cleaned it all up.
The Vicar saw her.
He comes over once a month, you know, and says Evensong in the church.
She sat and listened in the back pew.
Brought a huge bouquet.
Affectation.’
‘We saw —’
‘You don't have to shout at Miss Bailey, George,’ said his wife.
‘She's not responsible for all that.
There's no reason why she shouldn't be interested in Christabel.
I think you should show these young people Christabel's room.
If they want to see.
It's all locked away, you know, Mr Michell, and has been for generations.
I don't know what sort of a state it's in, but I believe some of her things are still there.
The family has occupied less and less of this house since the World Wars, every generation a little less — Christabel's room was in the east wing that's been closed since 1918, except for use as some kind of a glory-hole.
And we, of course, live in a very small part of the building, and only downstairs, because of my disability.
We do try to have general repairs done.
The roofs sound, and there's a carpenter who sees to the floors.
But no one 's touched that room to my knowledge, since I came here as a bride in 1929.
Then we lived in all this central portion.
But the east wing was — not out of bounds exactly — but not used.’
‘You wouldn't see much,’ said Sir George.
‘You'd need a torch.
No electricity, in that part of the house.
Only on the ground floor corridors.’
Roland felt a strange pricking at the base of his neck.
Through the carved window he saw the wet branches of the evergreens, darker on the dark.
And the dim light in the gravel drive.
‘It would be marvellous just to have a look.’
‘We should be very grateful.’
‘Well,’ said Sir George, ‘Why not?
Since it's all in the family.
Follow me.’
He gathered up a powerful modern storm-lantern and turned to his wife.
‘We'll bring you back any treasure we find, dear: If you wait.’
They walked and walked, at first along tiled and bleakly lit corridors under electric lighting, and then along dusty carpets in dark shuttered places, and up a stone staircase and then further up a winding wooden stair, cloudy with dark dust.
Maud and Roland neither looked nor spoke to each other.
The little door was heavily panelled and had a heavy latch.
They went in behind Sir George, who waved his huge cone of light around the dark, cramped, circular space, illuminating a semi-circular bay window, a roof carved with veined arches and mock-mediaeval ivy-leaves, felt-textured with dust, a box-bed with curtains still hanging, showing a dull red under their pall of particles, a fantastically carved black wooden desk, covered with beading and scrolls, and bunches of grapes and pomegranates and lilies, something that might have been either a low chair or a prie-dieu, heaps of cloth, an old trunk, two band boxes, a sudden row of staring tiny white faces, one, two, three, propped against a pillow.
Roland drew his breath in minor shock: Maud said, ‘Oh, the dolls ’— and Sir George brought his light back from a blank mirror entwined with gilded roses and focused it on the three rigid figures, semi-recumbent under a dusty counterpane, in a substantial if miniature four-poster bed.
They had china faces, and little kid-leather arms.
One had fine gold silken hair, faded and grey with the dust.
One had a kind of bunched white nightcap, in white dimity edged with lace.
One had black hair, pulled back in a circular bun.
They all stared with blue glassy eyes, filled with dust, but still glittering.
‘She wrote a series of poems about the dolls,’ said Maud, in a kind of dreadful whisper.
‘They were ostensibly for children, like the Tales for Innocents .
But not really.’
Roland turned his eyes back to the shadowy desk.
He did not feel the presence of the dead poet in the room, but he did have a vague excited sense that any of these containers — the desk, the trunks, the hat-boxes, might contain some treasure like the faded letters in his own breast-pocket.
Some clue, some scribbled note, some words of response.
Only that was nonsense, they would not be here, they would be wherever Randolph Henry Ash had put them, if they had ever been written.
‘Do you know,’ Roland said, turning to Sir George, ‘whether there were papers?
Is there anything left in that desk?
Anything of hers?’
‘That was cleared, I suppose, at her death,’ said Sir George.
‘May we at least look?’ said Roland, imagining perhaps a hidden drawer, and at the same time uncomfortably aware of the laundry lists in Northanger Abbey .
Sir George obligingly moved the light across to the desk, restoring the little faces to the dark in which they had lain.
Roland lifted the lid on a bare casket.
There were empty arched pigeonholes at the back, fretted and carved, and two empty little drawers.
He felt unable to tap and tug at the framework.
He felt unable to urge the unbuckling of the trunk.
He felt as though he was prying, and as though he was being uselessly urged on by some violent emotion of curiosity — not greed, curiosity, more fundamental even than sex, the desire for knowledge.
He felt suddenly angry with Maud, who was standing stock still, in the dark, not moving a finger to help him, not urging, as she with her emotional advantage might well have done, further exploration of hidden treasures or pathetic dead caskets.
Sir George said, ‘And what in particular might you expect to find?’
Roland did not know the answer.
Then, behind him, chill and clear, Maud spoke a kind of incantation.
Dolly keeps a Secret
Safer than a Friend
Dolly's Silent Sympathy
Lasts without end.
Friends may betray us
Love may Decay
Dolly's Discretion
Outlasts our Day.
Could Dolly tell of us?
Her wax lips are sealed.
Much has she meditated
Much — ah — concealed.
Dolly ever sleepless
Watches above
The shreds and relics
Of our lost Love
Which her small fingers
Never may move.
Dolly is harmless.
We who did harm
Shall become chill as she
Who now are warm
She mocks Eternity
With her sly charm.
Sir George swung the light back onto the dolls' cot.
‘Very good,’ he said.
‘Fantastic memory you've got.
Never could learn anything by heart myself.
Barring Kipling and the Lincolnshire bits that amuse me, that is.
What is it all about though?’
‘It sounds, in here, like a treasure-hunt clue,’ said Maud, still with a strained clarity.
‘As though Dolly is hiding something.’
‘What might she be hiding?’ said Sir George.
‘Almost anything,’ said Roland, suddenly wanting to put him off the trail.
‘Keepsakes.’
He could feel Maud calculating.
‘Somebody's children must have had those dolls out,’ said their owner plausibly, ‘since 1890.’
Maud knelt down in the dust.
‘May I?’
He turned the light down on her; there she was, her face bending into shadow, as though Latour had painted its waxiness.
She reached into the cot and plucked out the blonde doll by the waist; her gown was pink silk, with little rosebuds round its neckline and tiny pearl buttons.
She handed this creature to Roland, who took it as he might have done a kitten, cradling it in the crook of his elbow, and adding to it, in turn, the nightcapped one, in tiny white pleats and broderie anglaise, and the dark-headed one, severe in dark peacock.
They lay along his arm, their tiny heads heavy, their tiny limbs trailing, rather horrid, a little deathly.
Maud took out the pillow, untucked the counterpane, folded away three fine woollen blankets and a crocheted shawl, and then lifted out one feather mattress and another, and a straw palliasse.
She reached in under this, into the wooden box beneath it, prised up a hinged board and brought out a package, wrapped in fine white linen, tied with tape, about and about and about, like a mummy.
There was a silence.
Maud stood there, holding on.
Roland took a step forward.
He knew, he knew, what was wrapped away there.
‘Probably dolls' clothes,’ said Maud.
‘Have a look,’ said Sir George.
‘You seemed to know where to find it.
I bet you've got a shrewd guess what's in it.
Open up.
Maud plucked with pale neat lamplit fingers at the old knots, which were, she discovered, faintly covered with sealing wax.
‘Do you want a penknife?’ said Sir George.
‘We shouldn't — cut —’ said Maud.
Roland itched to help.
She worked.
The tapes fell way and the linen, many-layered, was turned back.
Inside were two parcels, wrapped in oiled silk, and tied with black ribbon.
Maud pulled at the ribbon too.
The old silk squeaked and slipped.
There they were, open letters, two bundles, neat as folded handkerchiefs.
Roland did step forward.
Maud picked up the top letter on each pile.
Miss Christabel LaMotte, Bethany, Mount Ararat Road, Richmond, Surrey.
Brown, spidery decisive, known, the hand.
And, much smaller, more violet, Randolph Henry Ash Esqre, 29, Russell Square, London.
Roland said, ‘So he did send it.’
Maud said, ‘It's both sides.
It's everything.
It was always there…’
Sir George said, ‘And what exactly have you got there?
And how did you know to go for the dolls' bed?’
Maud said, her voice high-edged and clear, ‘I didn't know.
I just thought of the poem, standing there, and then it seemed clear.
It was sheer luck.’
Roland said, ‘We thought there might have been a correspondence.
I found — a bit of a letter — in London.
So I came to see Dr Bailey.
That's all there is to it.
This could be —’ he was about to say ‘terribly’and held back —‘quite important.’
It could change the face of scholarship, he nearly said, and held back again,— driven by some instinct of cunning reserve.
‘It makes a great difference to our research work, to both our projects.
It wasn't known they knew each other.’
‘Hm,’ said Sir George, ‘Give those parcels to me.
Thanks.
I think we should go back down now and show these to Joan.
And see if they're anything or nothing.
Unless you want to stay and open everything else?’
He circled the round walls with his spotlight, revealing a skewed print of Lord Leighton's Proserpina, and a cross-stitched sampler, impossible to read under the dust.
‘Not now,’ said Maud.
‘Not immediately,’ said Roland.
‘You may never come back,’ said Sir George, more threatening than joking apparently, from behind his lance of light, turning through the door.
So they progressed back again, Sir George clutching the letters, Maud the opened cocoon of linen and silk, and Roland the three dolls, out of some vague fancy that it was cruel to leave them in the dark.
Lady Bailey was quite excited.
They all sat round the fireplace.
Sir George put the letters into his wife's lap, and she turned them over and over, under the greedy eyes of the two scholars.
Roland told his half-truth about his bit of a letter, not saying when or where he had come across it.
‘Was it a love letter, then?’
Lady Bailey asked, innocent and direct, and Roland said, ‘Oh no’ and then added, ‘but excited, you know, as though it was important.
It was a draft of a first letter.
It was important enough to make me come up here to ask Dr Bailey about Christabel LaMotte.’
He wanted to ask and ask.
The date, for God's sake, on the top letter from Ash, was it the same , why were they all together, how long does it go on,— how did she answer, what about Blanche and the Prowler…
‘Now what would be the right way to proceed?’ said Sir George slowly, and deliberately pompously.
‘In your view, young man?
In yours, Miss Bailey?’
‘Someone should read them —’ said Maud.
‘Oh —’
‘And you naturally think you should read them,’ said Sir George.
‘I — we — should like to, very much.
Of course.’
‘So would that American, no doubt.’
‘Of course she would.
If she knew they were there.’
‘Shall you tell her?’
He watched Maud hesitate, his fierce blue eyes shrewd in the firelight.
‘Probably not.
Not yet, anyway.’
‘You'd like the first crack?’
Maud's face flamed, ‘Of course.
Anyone would.
In my — in our position…’
‘Why shouldn't they read them, George?’
Joan Bailey enquired, drawing the first letter out of its envelope, looking casually down at it, not avid, barely curious.
‘For one thing, I believe in letting dead bones lie still.
Why stir up scandals about our silly fairy poetess?
Poor old thing, let her sleep decently.’
‘We aren't looking for scandals,’ said Roland.
‘I don't suppose there is any scandal.
I just hope — he told her what he was thinking about poetry — and history — and things like that.
It was one of his most fertile periods — he wasn't a great letter-writer — too polite — he said she understood him in the letter I — I — saw — he said —’
‘For another thing, Joanie, what do we really know about these two?
How do we know they're the proper people to have sight of these — documents?
There's two days' reading in that heap, easy.
I'm not letting them out of my hands, am I?’
‘They could come here,’ said Lady Bailey.
‘It's a bit more than two days,’ said Maud.
‘You see,’ said Sir George.
‘Lady Bailey,’ said Roland.
‘What I saw was the first draft of the first letter.
Is that it?
What does it say?’
She put on reading glasses, round in her pleasant large face.
She read out:
Dear Miss LaMotte,
It was a great pleasure to talk to you at dear Crabb's breakfast party.
Your perception and wisdom stood out through the babble of undergraduate wit, and even surpassed our host's account of the finding of Wieland's bust.
May I hope that you too enjoyed our talk — and may I have the pleasure of calling on you.
I know you live very quietly, but I would be very quiet — I only want to discuss Dante and Shakespeare and Wordsworth and Coleridge and Goethe and Schiller and Webster and Ford and Sir Thomas Browne et hoc genus omne , not forgetting of course, Christabel LaMotte and the ambitious Fairy Project.
Do answer this.
You know, I think, how much a positive answer would give pleasure to
Yours very sincerely
Randolph Henry Ash
‘And the answer?’ said Roland.
‘The answer?
I'm sorry — I'm so curious — I've been wondering if she answered, and if so, what she said.’
Lady Bailey drew out the top letter of the other sheaf, almost teasingly, like an actress announcing on television the award for the Best Actress of the Year.
Dear Mr Ash,
No truly — I do not Tease — how should I demean you or myself so — or you demean Yourself to think it.
I live circumscribed and self-communing — 'tis best so — not like a Princess in a thicket, by no means, but more like a very fat and self-satisfied Spider in the centre of her shining Web, if you will forgive me the slightly disagreeable Analogy.
Arachne is a lady I am greatly sympathetic to, an honest craftswoman, who makes perfect patterns, but is a little inclined to take unorthodox snaps at visiting or trespassing strangers, not perceiving the distinction between the two, it may be, often until too late.
Truly I make but a stammering companion, I have no graces, and as for the wit you may have perceived in me when we met, you saw, you must have seen, only the glimmerings and glister of your own brilliance refracted from the lumpen surface of a dead Moon.
I am a creature of my Pen, Mr Ash, my Pen is the best of me, and I enclose a Poem, in earnest of my great goodwill towards you.
Now would you not rather have a Poem, however imperfect, than a plate of cucumber sandwiches, however even, however delicately salted, however exquisitely fine-cut?
You know you would, and so would I. The Spider in the poem however, is not my Silken Self, but an altogether more Savage and businesslike sister.
You cannot but admire their facile diligence?
Would Poems came as naturally as Silk Thread.
I write Nonsense, but if you care to write again, you shall have a sober essay on the Everlasting Nay, or Schleiermacher's Veil of Illusion, or the Milk of Paradise, or What you Will.
Yours to command in some things
Christabel LaMotte
Lady Bailey's reading was slow and halting; words were miscast; she stumbled over hoc genus omne and Arachne.
It was like frosted glass between them, Roland and Maud, and the true lineaments of the prose and the feelings of Ash and LaMotte.
Sir George appeared to find the reading more than satisfactory.
He looked at his watch.
‘We've just time to do what I always do with Dick Francis; spoil the suspense by peeking at the end.
Then I think we'll put these away until I've had time to consider my position.
Take advice.
Yes.
Ask around a little.
You'd have to be getting back, anyway, wouldn't you?’
He was not asking.
He looked indulgently at his wife.
‘Go on Joanie.
Give us the end of it.’
She peered at the texts.
She said, ‘She appears to have asked for her letters back.
His is an answer to that.
Dear Randolph,
All is indeed at an end.
And I am glad, yes, glad with all my heart.
And you too, you are very sure, are you not?
One last thing — I should like my letters to be returned —all my letters without fail — not because I do not trust your honour, but because they are mine, now, because they are no longer yours.
You understand me, in this at least, I know.
Christabel
My dear,
Here are your letters, as you request.
They are all accounted for.
Two I have burned and there may be — indeed there are — others which should immediately meet the same fate.
But, as long as they are in my hands, I cannot bring myself to destroy any more, or anything written by you.
These letters are the letters of a wonderful poet and that truth shines steady through the very shining and alternating feelings with which I look at them in so far as they concern me, that is in so far as they are mine.
Which within half an hour they will not be, for I have them packaged and ready to be delivered into your hands to do with as you shall see fit.
You should burn them, I think, and yet, if Abelard had destroyed Eloisa's marvellous constant words, if the Portuguese Nun had kept silent, how much the poorer should we not be, how much less wise?
I think you will destroy them; you are a ruthless woman; how ruthless I am yet to know and am just beginning to discern.
Nevertheless if there is anything I can do for you in the way of friendship, now or in the future, I hope you will not hesitate to call upon me.
I shall forget nothing of what has passed.
I have not a forgetting nature.
(Forgiving is no longer the question, between us, is it?)
You may rest assured I shall retain every least word, written or spoken, and all other things too, in the hard wax of my stubborn memory.
Every little thing , do you mark, everything.
If you burn these, they shall have an afterlife in my memory, as long as I shall live, like the after-trace of a spent rocket on the gazing retina.
I cannot believe that you will burn them.
I cannot believe that you will not.
I know you will not tell me what you have decided, and I must cease scribbling on, anticipating, despite myself, your never-to-be anticipated answer, always in the past, a shock, a change, most frequently a delight.
I had hoped we could be friends.
My good sense knows you are right in your stark decision, and yet I regret my good friend.
If you are ever in trouble — but I have said that once already, and you know it.
Go in peace.
Write well.
Yours to command in some things
R.H.A.
‘You were wrong about the scandal,’ said Sir George to Roland, with a complicated mixture of satisfaction and accusation.
Roland felt a huge irritability mounting inside himself, mild though he knew himself to be, compounded of distress at hearing Lady Bailey's faded voice stammer across Randolph Henry Ash's prose, which sang in his head, reconstituted, and also of frustration because he could not seize and explore these folded paper time-bombs.
‘We don't know until we've read it all, do we?’ he retorted, creaky with self-restraint.
‘But it might put a cat among the pigeons.’
‘Not exactly .
The importance is literary —’
Analogies raced through Maud's mind and were rejected as too inflammatory.
It's as though you'd found — Jane Austen's love letters?
‘You know, if you read the collected letters of any writer — if you read her biography — you will always get a sense that there's something missing, something biographers don't have access to, the real thing, the crucial thing, the thing that really mattered to the poet herself.
There are always letters that were destroyed.
The letters, usually.
These may be those letters, in Christabel's life.
He — Ash — obviously thought they were.
He says so.’
‘How exciting,’ said Joan Bailey.
‘How very exciting.’
‘I must take advice,’ said Sir George, stubborn and suspicious.
‘So you shall, my dear,’ said his wife.
‘But you must remember that Miss Bailey was clever enough to find your treasure.
And Mr Michell.’
‘If, at any time, sir — you would consider giving me — us — access to the correspondence — we could tell you what was there — what its significance to scholarship was — whether an edition might be possible.
I have seen enough already to know that my work on Christabel must be seriously altered in the light of what you have in these letters — I wouldn't be happy going on without taking them into account — and that must be true of Dr Michell's work on Ash too, just as true.’
‘Oh yes,’ said Roland.
‘It might change the whole line of my thought.’
Sir George looked from one to the other.
‘That may be so.
That may well be so.
But are you the best people — to trust with the reading?—’
‘Once it is generally known,’ said Roland, ‘that these letters exist, everyone will be at your door.
Everyone.’
Maud, who was afraid of exactly this possibility, glowered whitely at him.
But Sir George, as Roland had calculated, was more alarmed at the thought of pilgrimages of Leonora Stern than aware of the possibilities of Cropper and Blackadder.
‘That won't do at all—’
‘We could catalogue them for you.
With a description.
Transcribe — with your permission — some —’
‘Not so fast.
I shall take advice.
That's all I can say.
That's f-air.’
‘Please,’ said Maud, ‘let us know, at least, what conclusion you come to.’
‘Of course we will,’ said Joan Bailey.
‘Of course we will.’
Her capable hands stacked those dry leaves in her lap, ordering; squaring.
Driving back in the dark, Roland and Maud communicated in brief businesslike bursts, their imaginations hugely busy elsewhere.
‘We both had the same instinct.
To play it down.’
Maud.
‘They must be worth a fortune.’
Roland.
‘If Mortimer Cropper knew they were there —’
‘They'd be in Harmony City tomorrow.’
‘Sir George would be a lot richer.
He could mend that house.’
‘I've no idea how much richer.
I don't know anything about money.
Perhaps we should tell Blackadder.
Perhaps they ought to be in the British Library.
They must be some sort of national heritage.’
‘They're love letters.’
‘It seems so, certainly.’
‘Perhaps Sir George will get advised to see Blackadder.
Or Cropper.’
‘We must pray not Cropper.
Not yet.’
‘If he gets advised to come to the University, he may simply get sent to me.
‘If he gets advised to go to Sotheby's, the letters'll vanish, into America or somewhere else, or Blackadder'll get them if we're lucky.
I don't know why I think that'd be so bad.
I don't know why I feel so possessive about the damned things.
They're not mine.’
‘It's because we found them.
And because — because they're private.’
‘But we don't want him just to put them into a cupboard?’
‘How can we, now we know they're there?’
‘Do you think we might agree — a kind of pact?
That if one of us finds out any more, he or she tells the other and no one else?
Because they concern both poets equally — and there are so many other possible interests involved…’
‘Leonora —’
‘If you tell her, it's halfway to Cropper and Blackadder — and they have much more punch than she has, I suppose.’
‘It makes sense.
Let's hope he consults Lincoln University and they send him to me.’
‘I feel faint with curiosity.’
‘Let's hope he makes his mind up soon.’
But it was to be some considerable time before any more was heard of the letters or of Sir George.
