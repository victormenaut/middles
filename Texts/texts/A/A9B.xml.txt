Max Grundig, 81, died yesterday in Baden-Baden.
He opened his shop in Nurenburg selling radios and producing transformers in 1930, and in 1945 he was allowed by the Allies to relocate his business in Furth, where it was one of the first to produce FM radios, then television sets â€” and high fidelity reel-to-reel tape recorders which serious musicians felt obliged to pay serious money for.
