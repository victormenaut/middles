Another day.
December 13, 1915, Hotel Beau Rivage, Bandol, to J.MMurry: My dear Heart, a week ago today you went.
The day seemed very long yesterday.
After giving your letter to my ‘bonne’ yesterday I gave up the fight and retired in good order to bed, where I am still.
The day seemed very long yesterday but I must say my ‘bonne’ was very good to me.
She gave me an extra pillow, kept me supplied with boiling bottles, brought me Vichy, and my meals on a little round table, actually produced a bottle of alcool camphre & frictioned me & gave me some lime flower tea before I went to sleep.
Not counting the number of times she put her fat face round the door & said, nodding and smiling as only a Frenchwoman can, with an air of delighted gaiety (!)
‘Vous souffrez toujours’.
Shes the only creature I've seen…
Kay's money has come and as I am spending nothing else it will be perfectly alright.
It is such a beautiful day today.
There seems to be a ring of light round everything — It is still and sunny — so still you could hear a spider spin.
I dreamed last night that I sat by a fire with Grandmother & my brother & when I woke up I still felt my brother's hand.
That is true.
For my hands were not together — They were holding another hand — I felt the weight and the warmth of it for quite a long time…

December 13, 1956: Dear Bunny, There are some delightful, first-rate pieces in your book, such as the one about your father and the first of the two about the Jews, but I am as always distressed by your conception of Russian history, which is all wrong, being based on the stale Bolshevist propaganda which you imbibed in your youth.
I cannot understand how you, who appreciate so much Russian writers of the Nineteenth Century, can combine this appreciation with a complete ignorance of the obshchestvennoe dvizhenie (liberal movement) that started in the time of Alexander I, was conspicuously present throughout the century (despite absolutism), and was deliberately played down by the Leninists and Trotskyists for propaganda reasons.
We have been always frank with each other, and I know that you will find my criticism exhilarating.

A Country Diary: OXFORDSHIRE: When, during the October gales, the ground beneath my Sturmer Pippin was strewn with windfalls, I attempted to harvest the remnant, but found that they were still firmly affixed to their spurs, and that those which had fallen had been wrenched off, spurs and all.
This fine old variety, raised in Suffolk about 150 years ago, owes its aromatic flavour to another good old apple, Ribston Pippin, which was one of its parents.
But, as a commercially viable variety in our climate, it has two drawbacks, firstly its lateness in ripening, and, secondly, in normal British weather, a dull russety-greenish colour which does not suggest the hidden flavour.
But, thanks to the sunny summer, many of the topmost specimens on my tree are as flushed with orange and pink as the imported stock from Australia.
Although it is assumed that birds have not a highly developed sense of taste, both tits and blackbirds, despite any flamboyant coloration to attract them, recognise Sturmers as worthy of attention, and those out of reach, when harder weather prevails, will, as in former winters, attract both fieldfares and winter-visiting blackcaps.
In his comprehensive Apples Of England, Dr Taylor states that ‘In England this variety only reaches full maturity in years of hot summers,’ and goes on to say that ‘Indeed, November- December-picked Sturmers are the best,’and, with a basket-full of fine specimens picked for the first time ever in the latter month, I agree.
A further bonus, as I now live alone and do my own catering, is that Sturmer is an excellent cooker.
