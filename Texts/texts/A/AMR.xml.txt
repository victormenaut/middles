INTRODUCTION
With the opening of the Channel Tunnel becoming a reality, and hopefully leading to a rise in rail traffic, one cannot help thinking that had the  magnificiently engineered GCR survived the troubled 1960's this would have been the chosen route for this traffic.
There have been repeated calls for reopening, but the destruction of many miles of trackbed would seem to make this a pipedream.
Even in 1893 when the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had opened its extension to London as the GCR, it was the wish of the Chairman, Sir Edward Watkin, that this should be the first stage of a connection to the Channel Tunnel if ever it was built.
Two notable ‘anniversaries’ crop up in 1991.
Almost unbelievably it is 25 years since closure of the GC main line between Sheffield and London Marylebone, and 10 years since the last train crossed the Pennines via the Woodhead Route.
Interest in the GCR never seems to wane, borne out by the fact that copies of our first volume have all been sold, and correspondence from readers invariably asks for more.
Unfortunately, unpublished material is getting scarce, and once again the plea for any unseen collections goes out — we would be delighted to produce a third volume.
In presenting this second book on the GC, I owe a considerable debt to a number of individuals who, where known have been individually credited — other views come from my own collection.
To all contributors therefore, I would like to record my appreciation for putting their collections at my disposal.

One of the writer's earliest memories of Nottingham comes from 1962 when he had alighted from a local train from Sheffield at the Midland Station.
There was always plenty of activity here, and so much so, that it was not until some time had elapsed, that a rumbling from above brought the GC to his attention.
This line passed over the Midland platform canopies on a series of viaducts between Weekday Cross and Arkwright Street, and it was a southbound fish train hauled by ‘Britannia’ No 70014 which was disturbing the station environs.
This loco was one of several allocated to the GC section for a period in the early 60's, seen here at the south end of Nottingham Victoria on a Marylebone semi-fast in July 1962.
Victoria was situated in a large cutting with tunnels at each end of the station.
A Manchester to Marylebone express departs for the south and approaches Thurland Street Tunnel headed by class A1 No. 2588 ‘Tracery’ in 1930.

A few class L1 tanks were allocated locally to Colwick, and one of these was usually worked back from Sheffield as pilot to the morning ‘all stations’ to Nottingham.
67770 has just been detached from Standard class 5 73156 at Victoria.
G Slinn
A southbound express for Marylebone awaits departure time at Nottingham Victoria platform 4 headed by B17 No. 2855 ‘ Middlesborough ’.
The northbound exit from Victoria was through a series of tunnels up to New Basford where a class 01 is seen approaching the station and signal box in March 1956.
H.B. Priestley
New Basford station, probably in the 1930's.
Bagthorpe Junction was some 3 miles from Nottingham, and it was here that the Great Northern branched off to Derby Friargate.

From Hucknall it was on to Annesley where a large shed provided motive power for the famous Woodford freights known as ‘Windcutters’ or ‘Runners’.
Annesley yard received and despatched coal trains from the local pits which were taken south at speeds of up to 50 m.p.h. eventually destined for the Western Region.
Annesley sheds in August 1963 with a visitor in the shape of rebuilt Patriot 45530 ‘Sir Frank Ree’.
Withdrawn class 01's have a class J39 for company, seen at the end of the yard, and in early 1962, more 01's share the shed yard with Britannia 4–6–2's 70014/49.
The Pacifics were used at this time on the Nottingham to Marylebone semi-fasts but they were to be transferred away as the rundown of the GC got underway.
Bob Tebb
From Annesley, the main line passed beneath the Robin Hood Hills to emerge near Kirkby South Junction where lines to Mansfield, and the Leen Valley to Shirebrook left the GC.
A class 31 is seen coming off the Mansfield line with a freight from Clipstone in 1965.

Class 9F No. 92091 on a northbound freight has just passed Kirkby South and begins the descent to Kirkby Bentinck.

A rare view of GN ‘Large Atlantic No. 4420 as it speeds past Pilsley box heading north in 1939.
GCR class 9P 4–6–0 No. 6164 ‘Earl Beatty’, one of the most powerful of all GC locomotives, is seen just south of Pilsley station as it heads an up express from Manchester in 1939.
Pilsley station looking south as a class 01 heads a Staveley bound freight in the 1950's.
With Pilsley Colliery on the skyline, class K3 No. 61870 comes southwards through Pilsley heading an excursion train in July 1955.
H.B. Priestley
Beyond Pilsley and close to the Eastern Region Border, the GC crossed over Locko Lane by way of a small viaduct.
A work stained Austerity 2–8–0 is in charge of a southbound mineral train in 1964.
This area today is completely transformed, with the course of the railway forming the Five Pits Trail for walkers, and there is absolutely no trace of Locko Lane viaduct, or indeed, the railway.
Bob Tebb
Transformation of the landscape at Holmewood has seen the obliteration of a huge cutting, the colliery and coke ovens, and Heath Station.
In the last days of the GC, there was only one regular daytime passenger train surviving, the York-Bournemouth.
Hauling its distinctive Southern Region set of green coaching stock, class 37 No.
D6807 passes Holmewood box with the southbound train in 1965.
Bob Tebb
It may have seemed unusual to see Royal Scot locos on the GC but Annesley had several on its allocation in the mid 60's for operating Nottingham-Marylebone semifasts.
They were so run down that passenger trains were rarely entrusted to them if anything else could be found, and they were to be seen hauling coal trains as on this occasion when No. 46156 ‘The South Wales Borderers’ passed Holmewood heading south in 1964.
Bob Tebb
Holmewood's ‘whistling’ bridge (it made noises if the wind was blowing through the rafters from the right direction) has just been passed by K3 No. 60896 as it heads a southbound coal train up the 1 in 100 in about 1961.
Bob Tebb
Holmewood Colliery provides an atmospheric background to this 1950's view of Heath Station.
From the same viewpoint today, there is a roundabout in the foreground, and an industrial estate will provide the background.
D. Thompson
This is Heath Station from a commercial postcard, posted circa 1900.
It obviously took the photographer, Arthur Richardson, some time to set up his equipment as he has attracted the attention of a few of the locals.
During the 1948 Locomotive Exchanges, several types not associated with the GC appeared on the Marylebone-Manchester trains, one of these being LMS class 5 No. 45253.
The photograph is believed to have been taken just north of Grassmoor on the approach to Hasland.
The late W. Wagstaffe
From Heath Junction, the Chesterfield Loop followed the Rother Valley towards the town, the station at Grassmoor being the first on this section.
This is Grassmoor circa 1947.
Like many other locations on the GC, this place is completely transformed, and now forms Corbriggs gipsy site.
By July 1959, the station has almost disappeared, but an atmospheric background was still provided by Grassmoor Colliery as B1 No. 61111 ran through on a Nottingham-Sheffield local.
H. B. Priestley
The final afternoon Sheffield-Nottingham ‘all stations’ was entrusted to B1 No. 61145, seen here on its way out of Chesterfield passing under Calow Lane bridge on 3rd March 1963.
J. Phipps
CHESTERFIELD
No. 61145 heads south towards Grassmoor and into history.
The link road to the M1 now uses this very route.
J. Phipps
3rd March 1962 was a sad day which was not helped by the depressing weather prevailing at that time.
It was the last day of local working between Nottingham and Sheffield and therefore the Chesterfield Loop.
Class B1 No. 61094 passes beneath the former LD & EC viaduct remains at Horns Bridge as it approaches Chesterfield with the early afternoon train from Leicester which would be recessed at Chesterfield before forming the 16.20 departure for Sheffield.

Just before closure of the line, new class 37 No.
D6798 passes beneath the LD & EC remains working Nottingham-Sheffield.
J. Phipps
Making a rare and possibly unique appearance on the loop is class 40 No.
D206 on what must be a diverted express, seen at Horns Bridge in 1958.
P. Nixon
After closure of the line, there was the occasional train into Hyde's siding at Horns Bridge plus a few demolition trains.
Class 01 63827 trundles a brakevan under the footbridge and Midland line on 8th June 1963.
This was after the 4472 hauled special, and may have been the final working into Hyde's.
J. Phipps
Horns Bridge and the Horns Hotel during the floods of 1932 with tracks covered.
Both Midland and LD & EC lines may be seen.
Using the church spire as a pointer, the GC may be discerned in this aerial view of the Horns Bridge area sometime in the 1930's.
There was a snowfall just before the turn of the year in 1962, and this is a picture of the 11.07 departure from Chesterfield Central to Nottingham, double-headed by Ivatt class 4 43156 and a class 5 4–6–0 seen approaching Horns Bridge.
J. Phipps
The final through train to run on the loop was the ‘Flying Scotsman’ hauled railtour of June 1963, which fought its way through the weed ridden tracks on its way south.
It returned via the main line.
It is seen emerging from Chesterfield Tunnel.
G. S. Perrin
Chesterfield Central was opened in 1893.
This view shows the station still under construction and it will be seen that a temporary track has been laid up the ramp to Infirmary Road to enable materials to be offloaded.
A railtour from Nottingham passed through Chesterfield on 15th May 1962 hauled by SR Schools class 30925 ‘Cheltenham’ and 2P 40646.
The latter had been officially withdrawn two days before, and this was to be its final working.
The late W. Wagstaffe
A fine view of Chesterfield Central dating from the 50's as the afternoon train to Sheffield Victoria waits to depart with Director 62667 ‘Somme’, as a later train headed by 62666 ‘Zeebrugge’ waits to take its place in the bay.
A view of Central from platform level in the early 50's as a class N5 draws to a stand by the signal box.
Quite a contrast in these view of Central from Infirmary Road; firstly from MS & L days with Mrs. Paulson's carriage awaiting custom, and as it was after closure with an assortment of 1960's cars on view.
Bob Tebb
The last operating day again just after 15.00 and 61094 has arrived from Leicester and is about to take water before setting back into the north bay.
G. Slinn
The view looking back to the station and 61094 — its departure was at 16.20.

It would appear that this B1 hauled up express has been diverted from the main line as it is under steam when approaching Wharf Lane footbridge.

Away from Central, the loop passed beneath Lockoford Lane before turning away from the town towards Brimington and Staveley.
A class V2 2–6–2 pulls away with a heavy down train, probably diverted from the main line.
P. Nixon
A small section of GCR remained until the early 1980's at Lockoford Lane, reached latterly from the Midland at Dunstone & Barlow sidings.
Opencasting was carried out where a new Supermarket now stands, and the final load of coal is ready to depart for Barrow Hill behind shunter 08509.
This viewpoint today would come from the middle of a traffic island.
A.R.
Kaye
It was unusual to see freights other than the local pick-ups on the loop.
Appearances were usually due to congestion or blockages on the main line.
A through mineral train headed by Austerity 90215 has been sent this way, seen coming underneath the Midland at Lockoford sidings.
The line running off left went to Pearson's Pottery.
G.S.
Perrin
Sheepbridge & Brimington station buildings may still be traced today, surrounded by commercial vehicles and patrolled by an aggressive  alsation .
On 25th July 1959 B1 61383 passed through with an up train.
The reversed headboard probably meant that the loco was required at Leicester to work the northbound ‘South Yorkshireman’ later that day.
H.B. Priestley
The Chesterfield Races were held within a  stones throw of Sheepbridge & Brimington, and this is an original GC poster from the year 1911 when the fare from Penistone was two shillings and sixpence.
STAVELEY WORKS
Scenes at Staveley Works in LNER days
A grimy and unidentified B16 draws a long freight out of the works sidings, and (right) J39 2702 shunts near the same spot.
The huge opencast Dixon's site currently occupies this area.
The 10.12 Chesterfield-Sheffield local arrives at Staveley Works in about 1937 hauled by GC class B5 No. 5186.
Note the bidirectional signal.
Staveley Works station was built over the Chesterfield Canal, and served Hollingwood and the Stanton & Staveley works which generated a good deal of freight traffic.
A local trip freight pulls out in the direction of Staveley hauled by a class J69 on 16th June 1956.
H.B. Priestley
The view from Hollingwood across the canal to the station.
A class D9 No. 6028 departs southwards, seen from the signal box.
STAVELEY
Seen from a passing train, class 47 No.
D1771 comes off the loop with a local trip freight in 1965.
By this time it was severed just around the corner from Staveley Town South Junction.
Bob Tebb
Staveley GC shed had always been the local dumping ground for withdrawn and stored locos from the Sheffield area.
This is an early 60's look at the dump showing Robinson 2–8–0's and Directors.

Three Robinson 2–8–0's awaiting their next turns of duty.
Part of the now defunct Ireland Colliery may just be discerned in the background.
Staveley B1 61312 holds a special place in the writer's memory.
It was this loco that regularly worked the 17.09 two coach local from Chesterfield to Sheffield in 1962, and after school it was customary to go down to the station and wait for it to arrive light engine.
After departure of the 1620 to Sheffield, and depending on the good will of the driver, we managed to achieve many foot plate rides down to Wharf Lane and back as the train had to reverse into the down bay.
We were even luckier on occasions with the offer of turns at the regulator which of course were never refused.
This was 61312 after withdrawal in April 1962 — a year after our adventures had ended.

This picture of A1 2558 ‘Tracery’ passing Staveley South at speed on the 10.00 Marylebone-Manchester was the very first such working after this type was transferred to the GC in 1930.

ARKWRIGHT
What a delight it must have been to watch express trains thundering up the bank at Arkwright bridge.
The writer only has memories of a few freights and the diesel hauled York-Bournemouth in 1964.
By this time trains were getting rare, and two hours might elapse during which time any sign of movement in Duckmanton South box would be looked for.
However, a southbound freight would often be heard departing from Staveley perhaps ten minutes before the signal man pulled off the concrete post LNER signal.
This is the southbound ‘Master Cutler’ with V2 60831 putting on a good exhaust in the early 1950's.
This train was diverted in 1958 to go via Retford.

A class J39 0–6–0 staggers up the bank at Arkwright with a mixed freight in LNER days (below).
Annesley  Brittanias did not normally venture away from the Nottingham to London semi-fasts but 70048 had worked a freight to Staveley.
It is seen at Arkwright, stopped by the Duckmanton South signal, no doubt waiting for a proceeding freight to clear the section to Heath Junction.
G.S.
Perrin
The GC was completely lifted as far north as Duckmanton North Junction, leaving a single track in use to serve Arkwright colliery via the LD & EC curves.
It was soon realised however, that a lot of time could be saved if access to the colliery was from Duckmanton South, and the embankment was cleared for a new section of line.
The main line was relaid and run round facilities installed.
Several trains ran weekly from Barrow Hill, reversing at Brighton to gain the GC.
Class 20's 20207/147 are seen near Duckmanton North by the remains of the LD & EC connection.

With only eight months to go before the closure of Staveley sheds, a local class 04 trundles down from Arkwright on a rake of coal empties from Kirkby Bentinck No. 63701 will deposit the train at Staveley, some two miles down the track, and beyond Duckmanton North Junction (below) seen in the distance.
Note the LD & EC connections, still used by trains to gain access to Arkwright Colliery at this time, 28th November 1964. both A. Smalley

Almost difficult to believe, but Beighton station level crossing was the first on the GCR out of London.
The station (closed in 1954) was just beyond the crossing.
A class B1 comes down the bank from Woodhouse on an up train — the photo was taken from a footbridge.

The Waleswood curve left the main line at Killamarsh Junction and crossed the Rother Valley — now landscaped to form the Country Park.
This is Waleswood Junction, with B1 61212 on a parcels train heading for Sheffield Victoria.
This loco was affectionately known as the ‘Retford Rocket’ by the spotters at Victoria as it nearly always appeared on this working.
In 1991 there is still a fine example of a GCR signal box at Shireoaks East Junction complete with an array of semaphore signals.
The year 1986 saw an open day held at Worksop, attended by 7F No. 53809 and other preserved locos.
The 2–8–0 is seen at Shireoaks as it takes the line to Shirebrook, heading back to its Buttlerley base.

In February 1970 there was a spectacular accident at Manton just east of Worksop when an empty MGR train became partially derailed and was struck by a Gainsborough-Ellesmere oil train headed by class 47 No.
D1784.
The loco went down the embankment taking some of the tanks with it, and the wreckage together with trees standing in the field were enveloped in flames which took several hours to extinguish.
The aftermath is seen, but it was to be several days before the damaged locomotive could be removed.
Surprisingly it was given an overhaul and returned to service six months later.

Retford marks the extent of our journey eastwards.
The station was reached via the Whisker Hill curve, seen in this rare view of Royal Scot 46151 ‘The Royal Horse Guardsman’ as it makes its way round the bend with an excursion.

One of the prototype diesels used on the Sheffield Pullmans in the 1960's was DP2.
Although it looked outwardly like a Deltic, it was actually the forerunner of class 50.

It was subsequently destroyed in a collision at Thirsk on the East Coast Main Line.

The landscape in this view from the same bridge may be compared with the previous one, and it will be seen that much of industrial Sheffield is disappearing for good.

Again in the same area, but from the canal bank and this time we have none other than Great Western 3440 ‘City of Truro’ making its way from York to Didcot and diverted onto the GC on a miserable day in April 1989.

SHEFFIELD VICTORIA
By 1845 the Pennines between Manchester and Sheffield were about to be conquered, and a terminus in Sheffield was opened at Bridgehouses on July 14th of that year.
The tunnel at Woodhead was not yet completed so a coach journey over the moors between Woodhead and Dunford was necessary until December 1845 when it opened.
Business began to boom, but the MS & L were already planning a new terminus over the Wicker arches and on 15th September 1851, Victoria opened its doors.
Expansion continued, with the famous Victoria Hotel added in 1862 but it was the intention of the MS & L to reach London with its own line and in 1897 the name Great Central was adopted in time for the opening of the main line to Marylebone in April 1899.
In 1923 the LNER was born, and the great variety of locomotives and coaching stock must have been a paradise for the enthusiast.
Electrification was first mooted during the early LNER days but it was to be 1954 before the final chapter in the story of Victoria opened.
Modernisation of the station took place, and the ‘Master Cutler’, introduced in 1948 became a Pullman train in 1958, but running via Retford to  Kings Cross .
Sadly the 1950's saw the withdrawal of through services to Marylebone and locals succumbed in 1963.
The end was in sight for Victoria, and the last departures via Woodhead were on 4th January 1970.
For more than ten years Victoria fell into a state of decrepitude and assumed a  ghost like appearance, and it was not until 1986 that final demolition was to take place to make way for an extension to the Victoria Hotel.
26027 runs through Victoria with a down mineral train in 1965.

The route between Deepcar and Wortley has now been permanently breached by the Stocksbridge Bypass.
Just how long the surviving branch line as far as here will remain open is anybody's guess, but there are usually two trip workings from Tinsley on weekdays.
In this view from early 1981, 76047 has just deposited its train in the BSC exchange sidings and returns light to Rotherwood.
Considering that closure for Deepcar station came as early as 1959, the lavatory sign has done well to survive.

In 1907 the GC opened Wath yard, ideally situated for accepting traffic from the South Yorkshire collieries.
Much of this went to Hull for export, but trains for Lancashire had to go up the formidable Worsborough bank avoiding Barnsley, and joining the main line just south of Penistone.
On the way up from Wath, the line passed Wombwell where a pair of class 76 electrics are seen as they approach Darfield Main in January 1981.

At Wombwell Main, the banking locomotives were added to the rear to push trains up to West Silkstone Junction.
A railtour from Sheffield to the Cromford & High Peak paused here in 1964 to attach prototype electric loco 26000 ‘Tommy’ to B1 61158 for the run across to Manchester.
This was the final steam locomotive to ascend the Worsborough incline.
Bob Tebb.
The lines from Sheffield and Wath were always difficult to work owing to the heavy traffic and steep inclines, so the LNER started a programme of electrification in 1936.
This was not to be finished until 1954 because of the Second World War, and the need to build a new tunnel at Woodhead.
Electrification is all but complete near Silkstone as K3 61960 toils up the hill with a heavy westbound train on 6th November 1951.

A Manchester-Marylebone express clears Dunford Bridge behind GCR class 9P No. 6165 ‘Valour’ the GC mobile war memorial.
The striking nameplates affixed to 6165 commemorated those GC employees who died in the Great War.
In 1922 a permanent war memorial was unveiled at Sheffield Victoria, and thereafter for many years, Valour appeared at the station for the Armistice service on 11 November.
Because it was rather special, Valour was regarded with particular pride, and was always immaculate.
It was cleaned by Gorton shed prior to taking out a southbound express and adorned with wreaths, it would enter Victoria just after the service had begun.
This continued until about 1939 when the ceremony passed into history.
The loco remained in service until 1947 but those final years saw it take on a neglected appearance but it remained at Gorton intact until 1950.
Perhaps it was the hope that preservation would be justified, and there was doubtless great reluctance to cut up such a famous engine.
Sadly it was not to be saved.
The south portal of the old Woodhead tunnel at Dunford Bridge is approached by a class B7 in about 1947.
Note the fine GC signal.
Of interest is the fact that a CEGB narrow gauge railway uses the eastbound portal of the old tunnel to this day and it is possible to walk through the other portal (with permission).

Class 04 2–8–0 No. 63902 emerges cone more into daylight, the long struggle from Penistone is over, and the crew can take things easy on the downhill run through Longdendale.
Between the years 1902–1902, there was actually a signal box situated well inside the Woodhead tunnel.
The conditions under which signalmen had to work can only be imagined.
It will be seen that work on the new bore is well advanced in this view from 30th June 1951.

Upon closure of Woodhead, the class 76's were simply shut down one by one and congregated at Guide Bridge for many months afterwards, eventually departing for scrapyards in Sheffield or Leicester.
The Woodhead route lay virtually untouched for several years after closure in July 1981, except for removal of valuable copper wires as a precaution against theft.
It was not until five years had elapsed that track lifting began in earnest, and this was only in fits and starts.
Demolition trains became a regular sight on Sundays during 1987 however, and for the first time in over 30 years it was possible to photograph trains without the hindrance of electric stanchions.
Many enthusiasts came for a last look and as each week passed there was a little less of the Woodhead line to photograph.
This was the scene at Crowden in July 1987 with class 74's 47146 and 47200 in attendance.

The train later made its way back towards Manchester seen crossing the B6105 at Torside — the famous signal box long since demolished,(above).
After closure of Woodhead to passengers in 1970, the route continued to be upgraded with continuous welded rail and some of the class 76 electrics were fitted for multiple working.
Even as this work was being carried out, freight traffic was in decline and BR soon made clear its intention to close the line as it could not be converted to 25 Kv AC.
This was later proved to be a nonsense as the Hadfield-Manchester section was converted a couple of years after closure of the rest of the system.

Throughout the 1970's, trains on the existing branch to Arkwright Colliery were having to reverse at Beighton to gain the GC, and the E.R.
put forward a scheme to lay a new spur from the Barrow Hill to Seymour line just north of Staveley Town.
This came to fruition in 1982 with the laying of track taking place (left).
Unfortunately this turned out to be a wasted effort, as the closure of Arkwright Colliery was announced soon after the first train had used the spur.
A.R.
Kaye
The line to Arkwright fell into decay, and appeared to be forgotten until early 1988 when it saw its final ‘working’.
The state of the track meant that trains got not further than Staveley Town and final lifting took place using a single wagon, pulled by a mobile crane.
The wagon is seen near Duckmanton North.
It had to be lifted off the track each night to prevent possible vandalism which could have seen it trundling down to Staveley on the falling grade!
