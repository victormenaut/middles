‘Stoke’ don St Michael's armour Jeremy Alexander recounts the exploits of Basingstoke, who do battle with Torquay United in the FA Cup on Saturday.
BASINGSTOKE's emblem has St Michael standing, with sword and long cross gules, over a dragon.
On Monday the football club were cast as dragon in a Hampshire Senior Cup match against Netley.
The dragon won.
On Saturday Basingstoke don the armour of St Michael as they take on Torquay at home in the second round of the FA Cup.
This, like most of Basingstoke itself, is new territory.
In the Sixties, said the lady at the museum, the old town was gutted.
Now the new town is being revamped.
From a distance it looks like Detroit.
Close up it is.
It is all ring roads, roundabouts and relocated offices.
‘We are in the hi-tech corridor between the M3 and M4,’ said the lady, dishing out brochures proclaiming as advantages the town's high-speed escapes to Birmingham, Liverpool, anywhere.
And the club could be 90 minutes from Anfield, quicker than InterCity.
The way their luck has run in this year's competition it is no idle dream.
They have come through five rounds already, enough to take a First Division side to Wembley.
In their first match, at home to Bashley, they equalised in the 88th minute.
In the replay they left it to the 90th and won in extra-time.
Having disposed of Chertsey and Witney, they did much the same in the fourth qualifying round against Marlow, equalising at home in the 82nd minute and winning the replay 2-1 with a goal in the 90th.
Someone, possibly all angels, is smiling on them.
In the last round they won 3-0 at home to Bromsgrove of the Beazer Homes League.
Basingstoke moved from the Beazer to the Premier Division of the Vauxhall League in 1987.
They went straight down, came straight up again and, going into their third successive season in a different division from the one before, hardly knew where they were.
Visitors to the town know the feeling.
Currently the club lie eighth with matches in hand.
After Bromsgrove they lost three games in a row, so it was important to get back to winning, against St Albans last Saturday then Netley 3-0.
Whatever happens on Saturday there will be plenty to keep the interest afterwards.
As their manager Trevor Williams says: ‘We can really enjoy this tie.’
They all say that, of course, and so they should — nothing to lose…except a dream.
Williams is in his first full season at the club.
He coached Fareham, then managed Gosport before arriving at Basingstoke for the last three games of last season.
After 10 days and three predictable victories they were promoted, thanks to Woking dropping a point.
He was named Manager of the Month.
If they win on Saturday it may be the freedom of the town.
Williams, grizzle-chinned and chirpy, teaches PE at Millbrook Community School, Southampton.
When he was at Cardiff College of PE he used to get Gareth Edwards to play.
Before that he had been at Lewis School, Pengam, when Neil Kinnock was house prefect.
It was all rugby there and Williams played fly-half for the school.
But a teacher, who had a contact at Cardiff City, got him a trial and before long he was representing Wales Under-18 against England at Elland Road, alongside John Toshack and marked by David Nish.
He remembers the school assembly when the honour was announced.
The headmaster was furious.
The boys chanted: ‘We want soccer.’
Williams won amateur caps and once, with Hitchin in 1974, reached this same round of the Cup.
They lost to Boston United, who then held Derby to a draw.
He knows these chances do not come often.
Basingstoke once reached the first round, in 1971.
They lost 5-1 at home to Northampton.
Some of the fans remember it, their memory jogged by the 3p programme which the club reproduced for the last round against Bromsgrove.
‘There was that Large, ‘e got two.
And Dixie McNeil.
I think ‘e scored.’
There was also Phil Neal, later of Liverpool and England, wearing No.8.
The supporters fall into two categories, those who sound like John Arlott and those who are almost too young to have heard of him.
Together they number some 500, though the social club has had to call a halt on membership at 2,000 and has a turnover of £2 ½ million.
For Bromsgrove the attendance was 2,361.
For Saturday the police have set a limit of 4,500.
Many junior matches have been postponed.
Television cameras will be there.
Even a full house would be piffling for a town with so vast a drawing area.
Forty years ago the population was under 20,000 but now it is seven times that.
The station on Saturday morning shows why.
It is thronged with the scarves of London clubs.
Offices may have been relocated, but not allegiances.
The big companies surely miss a chance by doing nothing for the club.
Most of the players are sponsored by individuals, garment by garment.
One, thanks to the groundsman, is kitted out by a pigeon club.
Fortunately the ground comes cheap, leased from the patron Lord Camrose on a peppercorn rent.
The club moved there in 1954.
It is cornered by a housing estate and has a 2ft slope at one end, nothing in Yeovil but a home advantage.
The programmes come easily, too.
The chairman, Gordon Hill, is a director of the Basingstoke Press.
On Monday night he rang from his car for the score.
It was 2-0 then.
Each came from a long cross by Jamie Webb.
Each was a hi-tech header from Nigel Mottashed, moving through the central corridor.
Basingstoke is noted for precision instruments.
Mottashed, the regulation fireman, is one of four players Williams brought from Gosport.
The others are Russell Davies (carpenter), Steve Greenwood (car salesman) and Steve Ingman (sheet-metal worker and central defender), who is fighting a hamstring injury.
Three of the team, Webb, Barry Blankley (full-back) and Leroy Whale (12 goals this season), have been on Southampton's books.
Brian O'Donnell played for Bournemouth and Torquay.
The heroes of the last round were perhaps Paul Clarkson and John Simpkins, the goalkeeper.
Simpkins, a double-glazing fitter who travels from the Isle of Wight, played on despite early injury.
Clarkson, a quality control inspector, scored two.
He will not worry about the quality if he does half as much on Saturday.
Tonight they have their final training session as usual, no doubt perfecting the set-pieces from which many of their goals stem.
They have a motto, abbreviated from the Epistles of Horace: ‘Vestigia nulla retrorsum’— no footprints in reverse.
It refers to the fable of the sick lion and the wary fox, who is frightened at seeing all the footprints pointing towards the den and none the other way.
Torquay United are warned.

Motor Racing Brabham for quick sale.
THE British-based Brabham team are up for sale because a company run by its owner Joachim Luhti is bankrupt, his lawyer said.
‘I am empowered to sell Brabham,’ the lawyer, Beat Widmer, said.
He declined to specify the Formula One team's ownership structure, quote a price or nominate prospective buyers — though, as reported in Tuesday's Guardian, there is speculation that the team will be taken over by people who want to field an all-Italian line-up, with Emanuele Pirro displacing Britain's Martin Brundle and joining Stefano Modeno.
Luhti was arrested in August and is now in investigative custody on suspicion of embezzlement through his Swiss Adiuva Finanz AG investment company, declared bankrupt a week ago.
Swiss authorities are probing the alleged misappropriation of about £60 million of investors' funds.
Widmer said he hoped to sell Brabham, founded in 1962 by the Australian triple world champion driver Jack Brabham, by the end of the year.
Luhti bought the team this year from the Swiss slot-machine magnate Walter Brun, who had bought it from Bernie Ecclestone, the head of the Formula One Constructors' Association (Foca).
The Brabham team won world constructors' championships in 1966 and 1967.
Their last world drivers' champion was the Brazilian Nelson Piquet in 1983.
The team finished equal eighth in this year's Formula One constructors' championship with eight points.

IT WAS after the Manchester City board appointed John Benson as manager in 1983 that Peter Swales, the chairman, announced: ‘It was a unanimous choice — which is unusual for us.’
The unusual, to say nothing of the bizarre, seems always to lurk close by the main door of Maine Road.
Yet yesterday's appointment of Howard Kendall as manager seems, on the face of it, one of the most rational and sensible moves the Blues have made in recent years.
Kendall, aged 43, was City's initial choice after Mel Machin had been sacked, but discussions broke down when the former Everton and Athletic Bilbao manager insisted on a release clause in his contract should he be approached by England.
City then tried for Kendall's former Everton team-mate Joe Royle, the Oldham manager.
Royle refused, so City and Swales, having dug themselves a large hole, returned to Kendall and agreed to his terms.
The contract is for three years, with the annual salary thought to be £130,000.
But should England do badly in Italy next summer, leading to Bobby Robson's resignation or sacking, Kendall might find his shoulder touched by those at Lancaster Gate in preference, say, to Graham Taylor or Terry Venables.
In this respect City's sixth manager in nine years might yet become another of their shorter-term employees.
Kendall has been in Spain this week but will watch his new club at Southampton on Saturday and take charge on Monday.
As fate would have it, his first match in charge will be at Everton a week on Sunday in front of the ITV cameras.
City are currently bottom of the First Division and Kendall spoke realistically about the task ahead.
‘Obviously I would like to be as successful as I was at Everton,’ he said, ‘but you cannot do that in five minutes.
‘It's no good talking about potential.
The most important thing is that next season Manchester City are in the First Division.’
Swales has promised Kendall ‘the tools to do that’.
Money is available for new players and he has a free hand to change the backroom staff.
If Kendall takes up that offer, he may appoint the former England midfielder Peter Reid, currently at QPR, as his player-coach.
The backroom staff might also include the former City stalwart Paul Power, who finished his First Division career at Everton after being signed by Kendall.
Tony Book, after his brief caretakership, will probably also stay.
Once Royle had turned City down, Swales and his board had little option but to agree to Kendall's terms.
The chairman said yesterday: ‘I sat down on Sunday and thought ‘I must be mad not to go for Kendall’ and I revived the deal on Monday.’
The club badly need a manager of quality and stature and only two current First Division managers have an equal or better success rate, Liverpool's Kenny Dalglish and Brian Clough at Nottingham Forest.
City were no doubt further spurred by the discord at Old Trafford, where Alex Ferguson's future is uncertain.
Kendall has frequently mentioned United in his musings, so City had no time to waste.
It was in 1981 that Kendall left Blackburn to become Everton's eighth manager since 1946.
He is no City's 17th in the same timespan.
But he was not, their fans should note, an immediate success.
In 1981 Everton were haunted by Liverpool.
At least he will have no United ghost on his shoulder, although Ferguson's team is insubstantial enough.
Kendall was never afraid to spend money, signing Adrian Heath for a then club record of £800,000 from Stoke, but many of his best buys came from the lower divisions: Neville Southall from Bury, Derek Mountfield from Tranmere and Bolton's Peter Reid.
City last won the championship in 1968 and the FA Cup in 1969, those champagne days of Mercer and Allison.
Book was the last manager to bring a senior trophy to Maine Road, the League Cup in 1976.
Born: Ryton-on-Tyne, May 22, 1946.
Playing career: Preston, Everton, Birmingham, Stoke, Blackburn.
Honours: League championship (Everton) 1969-70; FA Cup finalist 1964 (Preston); six England Under-23 caps.
Managerial career: Blackburn (1979-81), Everton (1981-87), Athletic Bilbao (1987-89).
Honours:(Blackburn) Promotion to First Division 1980.
(Everton): League champions 1985 and 1987; FA Cup Winners 1984; European Cup-Winners' Cup 1985.

Manager of the Year 1985 and 1987.
By Mike Selvey
FRANK CHAMBERLAIN, the 64-year-old chairman of Northamptonshire, is to become the next chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board, succeeding Raman Subba Row who steps down next October.
At the TCCB winter meeting at Lord's yesterday, the chairmen and chief executives of the 17 first-class counties opted for Chamberlain rather than the only other candidate, Don Perry, the Gloucestershire chairman, and although no one was giving very much away at Lord's yesterday Chamberlain's majority, like that elsewhere the previous day, was believed to be substantial.
So a man who has hitherto led a quiet life, in terms of cricket administration, finds himself thrust into the forefront of the game's politics.
He must need his head testing.
Chamberlain's experience of first-class cricket is slim, confined to six matches for Northants shortly after the war.
Instead his working life has been devoted, as one might expect from that neck of the woods, to the shoe trade, helping build up the family firm into a multinational concern.
He is also on the board of a number of City companies, and for his sins is a former Master of the Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers.
He has been chairman of Northants since 1985, the year Subba Row took over his role at the TCCB, and has served on the board's finance comittee.
Subba Row, who will not have had a hand in this particular decision, sees him as a ‘good scout’.
He will certainly need to be well prepared for the task which faces him, with international cricket politics becoming increasingly complex.
On the home front his business experiences should stand him in more than good stead: cobblers is the stock-in-trade of most cricket committees.

Sheffield strengthen their hand by signing two New Zealand forwards.
SHEFFIELD EAGLES showed their enterprise again yesterday when they signed two forwards from New Zealand's recent tour, Francis Leota and Tawere Nikau, writes Paul Fitzpatrick.
Leota, more than 15 stone but a fast, mobile, strong second-row forward, and Nikau, a 22-year-old 6ft 1in loose forward, will fill the vacancies left by Bruce McGuire and Jeff Hardy when the Australians return home in January.
Both are members of the Otahuhu club in Auckland.
Gary Hetherington, Eagles' chairman and coach, said they maintain the club's tradition for signing young, skilful, enthusiastic players.
Leota, aged 25, was an exciting member of the party though his Test contribution was restricted to an appearance as substitute.
His contract runs until March 1991.
Nikau will remain until the end of the season with the option of staying for another.
St Helens have given another Kiwi, Teo Ropati (knee injury), until next Thursday to prove his fitness.
Squash Harassed Harris.
By Richard Jago
THE national championships begin in Newcastle today with Martine Le Moignan, the world champion, and Del Harris, the England No.1, defending their British titles in far less confident mood than would have been the case a few months ago.
On Monday Le Moignan was beaten by her old adversary Lisa Opie, and Harris lost to Paul Gregory, his closest friend on the circuit, two weeks ago.
Both have been suffering from a surfeit of squash, according to the man who manages them, Norman Norrington.
After eight years of competitive play, Harris is confronted by ‘a very serious’ career crisis, says Norrington, but another failure in the national championships would be a devastating blow to the 20-year-old's season and to his chances of making the top handful in the world in seasons to come.
He is seeded to meet Gregory in Monday's semi-finals.
Le Moignan has talked about retiring in two years' time, but that could be hastened if there were another loss to Opie, who has made a determined comeback after defeats in the world and British opens.
A more carefully prepared training programme and an easier tournament schedule have helped the world No.2 to win three important tournaments in recent months, whereas Le Moignan appears to have been struggling with her motivation.
Yet the world champion is so unpredictably gifted that one on-song display could easily enable her to sweep aside the opposition.
The two old adversaries are seeded to meet in Tuesday's final.
Livesey kicks his way into South-West side.
MARTIN LIVESEY, the Richmond fly-half, will make his first appearance for the South-West in the Toshiba Divisional Championship match against the holders, London, at Imber Court on Saturday, writes Robert Armstrong.
Livesey, who replaces Mike Hamlin of Gloucester, has been drafted in to give the West Countrymen greater control at half-back after their 21-9 defeat by the North in Bristol last Saturday.
The South-West, who beat London last year, have made a total of three changes, choosing the Plymouth wing Steve Walklin instead of Peter Blackett of Bath, and bringing in the Bath lock Nigel Redman in place of his club-mate John Morrison.
Mike Teague, the Lions flanker, will continue his representative comeback with his second divisional appearance this season.
Livesey, of Plymouth, is the third-top scorer in English rugby this season with a total of 140 points, all but four of them from his prolific goalkicking.
Last season he was Richmond's top scorer with 182 points.
London, who retain the side that defeated the Midlands last weekend, are favourites to clinch the title they won for the first time last year.
SOUTH AND SOUTH-WEST: J Webb (Bristol); J Fallon (Richmond), S Halliday (Bath), A Adebayo (Bath), S Walklin (Plymouth); M Livesey (Richmond), R Hill (Bath); A Sharpe (Bristol), K Dunn (Gloucester), R Pascall (Gloucester), N Redman (Bath), J Etheridge (Gloucester), M Teague (Gloucester), D Sims (Gloucester), A Robinson (Bath).
Replacements: J Callard (Bath), M Hannaford (Gloucester), M Hamlin (Gloucester), G Mann (Bristol), P Jones (Gloucester), S Newman (Harlequins).
Sean Robinson, Middlesex's full-back, scored two tries in the final five minutes to give them victory over Hertfordshire by one point, 22-21, in the Toshiba County Championship at Croxley Green to go into the London play-off.
Allan Martin, sacked as coach to Aberavon's forwards this week, believes that Welsh rugby is becoming too much like football with the current spate of hiring and firing based on league results.
‘All the club is worried about is finishing in the top half of the Merit Table so they will be in the top division when leagues start next season,’ he said.

CONTRARY to predictions, Malcolm Reilly was not installed as Great Britain's coach yesterday.
Although he seems sure to remain in the job, the delay has invited speculation.
In a terse statement the board of directors said it had ‘considered the Great Britain management set-up and individual talks will take place over the next few days before a formal announcement is made’.
This could mean that the board and Reilly still have some bargaining to do before the contract is signed.
It could also indicate that there is uncertainty about Reilly's support team, which consists principally of Les Bettinson, the manager, and Phil Larder, the national director of coaching.
These three have worked together harmoniously and with some notable successes since Reilly took charge early in 1987 and it is certain that he would want them alongside him again for the hard year ahead, in which Great Britain play 10 Tests, including three World Cup games.
It could also be that Reilly, who has never knowingly sold himself short, is driving a hard bargain.
He knows that he has no serious rival for the job.
The board meanwhile has tried to dissuade players from choosing a contract with an Australian club over a place on the tour of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand next summer.
Any players pursuing such action, it says, will not be given clearance to play abroad.
A long-standing by-law has been invoked to support the stance of the board.
Bob Ashby, the chairman, said that international football was considered to be of paramount importance to the status of Rugby League and that selection for Great Britain must not be devalued.
Great Britain, he said, had emerged as a force once more after their victory over Australia in Sydney last year and their recent wins over New Zealand, and next summer's tour was a vital preparation for the visit of the Australians in the autumn of 1990.
‘The board are extending a long-standing by-law which prevents a player who has rejected an international invitation from performing at club level during the summer period,’ said Ashby.
But can the Rugby League make it stick?
The spectre of restraint of trade rears its ugly head.
The issue is far from closed.
GB learn what coach Reilly wants.

It could also be that Reilly, who has never knowingly sold himself short, is driving a hard bargain.
He knows that he has no serious rival for the job.
The board meanwhile has tried to dissuade players from choosing a contract with an Australian club over a place on the tour of Papua New Guinea and New Zealand next summer.
Any players pursuing such action, it says, will not be given clearance to play abroad.
A long-standing by-law has been invoked to support the stance of the board.
Bob Ashby, the chairman, said that international football was considered to be of paramount importance to the status of Rugby League and that selection for Great Britain must not be devalued.
Great Britain, he said, had emerged as a force once more after their victory over Australia in Sydney last year and their recent wins over New Zealand, and next summer's tour was a vital preparation for the visit of the Australians in the autumn of 1990.
‘The board are extending a long-standing by-law which prevents a player who has rejected an international invitation from performing at club level during the summer period,’ said Ashby.
But can the Rugby League make it stick?
The spectre of restraint of trade rears its ugly head.
The issue is far from closed.
JIM COURIER and Pete Sampras (top) lost their opening round-robin match against Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzman in the eight-team Nabisco Masters doubles championship at the Royal Albert Hall yesterday, but they are tipped to make an impact on the doubles game, writes Martin James.
As juniors the two American teenagers were mentioned in the same breath as Andre Agassi and Michael Chang as singles players, but neither has made quite the same impact as yet.
Sampras will finish the year in 81st place, Courier a more respectable 24th, but in doubles they have eclipsed their more renowned contemporaries and deserved to qualify for the Masters when Ken Flach and Robert Seguso were forced to withdraw at the last minute.
‘We play doubles because we feel it will help us to become more complete players,’ said the 19-year-old Courier, who comes from the same stable as Agassi and has a similar big-hitting baseline game but a much more diplomatic air about him.
Sampras, 18, is equally controlled but in contrast is a serve-and-volley player.
He too believes his singles game can improve by playing doubles, and added: ‘It has also brought us closer together as friends.
It is nice to have someone else of your own age on the tour.
Chang doesn't really talk and Agassi is in a world of his own.’
Yesterday Sampras and Courier were almost in a world of their own.
There were barely 300 people in the Royal Albert Hall when they opened the morning session against the more experienced Australian pairing of Cahill and Kratzman.
‘It's a stunning setting but everyone was so silent it was like playing in a church.
There was no buzz.
It was like playing a practice match,’ said a disappointed Courier after he and his partner were well beaten 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 in their opening red-group match.
Clearly they have some way to go but they can still look back on 1989 with a glimmer of pride.
In only their second event together they reached the final of the Tournament of Champions in New York, and then captured the Italian Open in Rome.
‘They are going to be very good but they need to learn to combine better,’ observed Cahill.
‘They hit the ball as hard as almost anyone.’
Sarah Loosemore beat Jennifer Santrock, ranked 95 places above her, 6-4, 7-6 on the first day of Great Britain's defence of the Maureen Connolly Trophy in Cardiff, but Valda Lake fell apart in the second set against the Australian Open junior champion, Kim Kessaris, losing 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.

Racing: Punters in uproar after Bully Boy floors favourites.
By Ken Oliver
PUNTERS at Huntingdon yesterday were up in arms after Bully Boy, the outsider of three, stormed home by a distance in the Long Sutton Handicap Chase.
But victory ran true to racing's adage ‘there's nothing like experience’ because the winner was ridden by Pat Leech, who has ridden more than 150 winners, while the two market leaders were partnered by riders with less than a handful of winners between them.
Roddy Greene, on Market Leader (10-11), and Tom Cloke, on Vaguely Artistic (11-10), were content to sit and wait, while Leech sent Bully Boy into a commanding lead.
Bully Boy, who had been backed from 20-1 down to 9-1, was a fence clear by the time the third obstacle was jumped and, despite making a terrible blunder at the fifth, he never looked likely to be challenged.
Both Greene and Cloke were jeered as they passed the post and cries of ‘cheats’ greeted them as they rode their mounts back to the unsaddling enclosure and were hauled before the stewards.
Bully Boy's owner, Ron Taylor, who is involved in various interests in Lambourn, admitted to having ‘a nice punt’ on the six-year-old, who was tackling fences for the first time.
‘We knew he wouldn't get caught,’ he exclaimed.
It was not only trainer Willie Brooks's first winner under National Hunt rules, but his first steeplechase runner.
All three jockeys gave evidence to the stewards, who, after hearing from the betting intelligence officer, accepted their explanations and took no further action.
So, to the amazement of many racegoers, the two young jockeys escaped without even a caution.
But for a young casual Tote employee the incident had a different ending.
He foolishly wrote on the results board in the Tote Credit office: ‘Was this fixed?’ and has been suspended.
Leech said that Bully Boy set off very quickly, but he was able to settle the gelding after the first two fences and went on to win unchallenged.
Cloke said his instructions on Vaguely Artistic were to sit upsides the favourite, Market Leader, and not to go to the front too quickly.
He was not concerned at the early pace set by Bully Boy, but he did become worried at the water jump, where he changed his hands and asked his mount to quicken with hands and heels, as he had dropped his whip.
Trainer Geoffrey Hubbard's assistant, Ferdie Murphy, said Vaguely Artistic was ungenuine and he was happy with the riding of the grey.
Greene told the inquiry, which was spread over three races, that his instructions were also to sit in behind and monitor Vaguely Artistic.
He felt Bully Boy had set out too quickly, but when he asked Market Leader to quicken in the back straight he got no response.
Richard Lee, who trains Market Leader, expressed himself happy with Greene's riding and said he felt Market Leader was a moderate animal.
Pakistan v India, third Test Shoaib cashes in.
SHOAIB MOHAMMAD completed a double century, his first in Tests, before the third Test at Lahore was allowed to subside into the inevitable draw yesterday.
Pakistan were 699 for five in reply to India's first innings score of 509 when the game was called off 10 overs into the final hour with Shoaib 203 not out.
Pakistan's score was the highest by any side in a Test in Pakistan, surpassing the 561 they made against New Zealand in 1955-56, and the highest in matches between the two countries.
Only two wickets fell yesterday, slightly below the game's average of three a day.
Krishnamachari Srikkanth, the Indian captain, was mildly critical of the Lahore wicket.
It was, he said, ‘not in the best interests of cricket’.
Javed Miandad and Shoaib, resuming yesterday morning at 416 for three, carried their fourth-wicket stand to 246.
Miandad, 84 not out overnight, went on to make 145 in six hours — his 22nd century in his 100th Test — before being bowled by Ravi Shastri.
He hit a total of 10 fours in his 291-ball innings.
Shoaib, 90 not out overnight, reached his double century by hitting Shastri for his 19th four through the midwicket area.
He faced 369 balls.
Shoaib, whose previous highest Test score was the 163 he notched up against New Zealand at Wellington earlier this year, added 134 for the fifth wicket with his captain, Imran Khan.
Imran provided most of the day's highlights with his 66 off 95 balls, including two huge sixes off the left-arm spinner Maninder Singh, but Sanjay Manjrekar will also be able to recall this game with some fondness.
He scored 218 runs, won the Man of the Match award and caught Imran while standing in as the understudy wicketkeeper for Kiran More.
Shastri was the day's only wicket-taker.
Abdul Qadir, who finished unbeaten on 39, became the fourth Pakistani after Intikhab Alam, Imran Khan and Sarfraz Nawaz to achieve a Test double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets.
He passed 1,000 when he reached 24.
With the first two Tests of the four-match series also ending in draws, the outcome of the series rests on the last Test match starting at Sialkot on Saturday.
Windsor Park for all-weather treble.
By Richard Baerlein
THIS time last year I struck one of the most unlucky ante-post bets of my whole racing career when taking the 16-1 Ten Plus for the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
He was going like a winner when he came to the third from home, fell and broke a leg.
With the present favourite, Carvill's Hill, 9-2 for next year's race there is no incentive to back him as he will not run if the ground is firm, while the 5-1 second favourite-last year's winner, Desert Orchid-is unlikely to run in any case.
Therefore, there must be value elsewhere and I have been studying the other prices.
There is no young chaser with quite the promise of Ten Plus among the unknowns.
Desert Orchid's stable companion, Barnbrook Again, will no longer be a 12-1 shot if he wins the King George V1 Chase on Boxing Day.
There must be a doubt about such a brilliant two miler staying the distance, but this does not appear to worry his connections.
Jenny Pitman has high hopes of the 16-1 chance Golden Freeze developing into a top class performer and he has plenty of scope.
He has been given time to develop and in a recent interview on TV the trainer was even talking in terms of a possible Grand National victory.
Martin Pipe's soft ground performer, Rusch de Farges, has made a rapid advance in the market, but is the weather ever going to change?
Pipe also has the 20-1 shot Bonanza Boy in the race.
He is on my short list as a possible Grand National winner.
The Thinker, already a winner of the race, stands at 20-1, but he is difficult to train and even more difficult to catch on the right day.
I have no doubt that if the ground is in his favour Carvill's Hill will start a good favourite and few will want to oppose him.
He did really well as a novice a year ago in some top class races in Ireland and, although he fell at the seventh in last year's Gold Cup, he should be a more mature horse and a better jumper this season.
But one must wait until one knows the ground before he can be supported.
Backers of favourites should have a profitable afternoon at Lingfield.
In particular, Windsor Park, who makes his hurdling debut in the Three Hostages Juvenile Novice Hurdle, should make no mistake.
Since he was claimed for £18,000, this gelding, formerly owned by the Queen, has won twice and been second twice on the flat when trained by Roland O'Sullivan.
He appears to be something of a Lingfield specialist, having won twice on the all-weather flat track.
His inexperience over hurdles should not be a bar to victory here.
While Martin Pipe could have a couple of Lingfield winners in Celcius and Lonely Reef, his regular jockey, Peter Scudamore, has been claimed by Charlie Brooks, who hopes to have a double at Uttoxeter with Espy and Roscoe Harvey.
While Scudamore can score on Martin Pipe's Galwex Lady in the Burton Rubber Company Hurdle, I doubt if Espy will give 5lb to Rolling Dice, a very promising chasing recruit.
She beat Gambling Royale very easily last time out.
Boxing Desperate Duran the old favourite.
John Rodda in Las Vegas predicts that Ray Leonard will feel the strain of the advancing years more than his rival in tonight's big fight
AMID the fortune hunters who throng this city of make-believe, it is a simple step to imagine that tonight's event at The Mirage, the newest and brashest gambling hole on The Strip, is the sporting event of the Eighties.
Yet we all might wake up to realise that The Mirage is the most appropriate name for such a venue.
Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, legends of the ring years before they reached this collision, will reach out and try to mist the reality that they are both beyond their peaks of power and reflex action.
Physical decay is setting in at 38 for Duran and 33 for Leonard, yet in the most hazardous of sports they persist, in the fashion of the times, in trying to defy the ageing process.
Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes and soon no doubt George Foreman have shuffled into the ring like men with begging bowls, the clinking coin of television revenues their nursemaid.
Tonight's contribution is awesome in the decibels of that noise.
Going down a sporting memory lane has enticed some 16 million people to pay their cable-TV charge to watch the fight.
Millions more around the world will swell that figure to the largest gross revenue in boxing history, for a contest where both men admit their best days are behind them.
It is their third meeting, the first two having taken place within the space of five months in 1980.
That June, Duran clamped Leonard's artistry by drawing him into a slugging match in Montreal and inflicting on the American what was to be his only defeat in 37 contests.
Leonard avenged that reverse in New Orleans the following November in the notorious ‘no mas’ night of surrender which has haunted the Panamanian all the way to this bonanza.
His subsequent career has been a switchback which reached its nadir five years ago, when Thomas Hearns produced a devastating right to the chin to knock him out and send him into retirement.
But Duran's failure to control his cash flow had him ducking under the ropes again 18 months later.
There were some indifferent performances against indifferent opponents until in Atlantic City earlier this year he floored and outpointed Iran Barkley to win the World Boxing Council middleweight title, a surprise which opened the door to tonight's affair.
Leonard retired for the first time in 1982 with a detached retina which until recent times would have ended his fighting career permanently.
But modern technology now makes perfect repair work possible, so Leonard came back even though he now had a lucrative television career and had astutely invested his fortune.
He had one fight in 1984 and was knocked down for the first time in his career.
He retired again but returned in 1987 when, without any warm-up contest, he went straight into a world middleweight title fight with Marvin Hagler.
Whatever the arguments about the verdict, which Leonard took, his speed and fitness were astounding.
In the two fights since then, however, vulnerability has loomed.
Donny Lalonde, a tall, awkward fighter with a shoulder disability which foreshortened his left-hand hitting, knocked Leonard down.
Thomas Hearns did so twice in June of this year, but Leonard managed to retain his super-middleweight title with a draw.
The fight with Hearns brought a new questioning of boxing and this type of ‘golden oldie’ encounter.
Were they really trying?
Hearns had looked over-the-hill in his previous fight and the pair at times did not appear to have the earnestness which fighters normally show.
In a fight between men who are past their prime, the most telling factor surely must be motivation.
Leonard has again been saying this week that this is likely to be his final contest.
He admits that having taken the decision to box again, the regime of the work seems harder, the magnet of other interests and causes in life seems stronger.
He has even looked benignly bored in the final days of preparation; he has no need, other than to satisfy the boxing historians, to climb into the ring again.
Duran, in contrast, does need the fight — firstly to pay some tax debts, but above all to erase the memory of their last encounter.
This, like his last fight with Barkley, is a rare opportunity and as on that occasion he will fight until he drops.
Over 12 rounds the fleet feet and mind of Leonard will, I suspect, no longer be quick enough to escape.
In eight or nine rounds the referee should be stepping in to rescue the younger man, unless he is knocked out.
US Treasury officials have warned the promoter, Bob Arum, that he risks breaking the law by selling the fight to a Panamanian TV station.
Such deals have been made illegal in protest at the Noriega regime.
Rowing: Spracklen pulls out in dudgeon.
By Jon Leyne
MIKE SPRACKLEN, who coached British crews to gold medals at the last two Olympics, has taken a £30,000-a-year job in Canadian rowing after alleging he was snubbed by the British sport despite offering his services free.
Spracklen, who has accepted the position of coach to the Canadian men's team, has been involved in a long-running disagreement with the director of international rowing, Penny Chuter.
A mutiny against the rowing establishment last summer by oarsmen being coached by him was patched up in time for the world championships in Yugoslavia, but at the end of the championships Spracklen declared that he had no future in British rowing.
After the trouble the Amateur Rowing Association decided to restyle Chuter's job as performance director and to advertise the post.
Chuter was widely expected to be offered the new position, and Spracklen believes that his offer to take it on unpaid was ‘an embarrassment’ to the ARA.
‘They obviously didn't want me, so I won't apply,’ he said.
‘I did write to them but I was just snubbed.’
Spracklen believes the ARA deliberately delayed answering his inquiry until he had left for his interview in Canada.
The ARA will not now fill the post until the new year.
For those who believe rowing coaches are megaphone-wielding martinets, Spracklen's style has been refreshing: a quiet, almost whining drone of a voice, softly pointing out technical faults or a lack of commitment in a way which commands almost total respect from his charges.
That will be missed.
So will the way in which he championed the traditional principles of technique.
Spracklen, who is 52 and lives in Marlow, has been largely responsible for their revival, believing them as valid today as they were 100 years ago.
Above all his move means leaving behind the double Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave and his pairs partner Simon Berrisford, as well as a number of other promising young British oarsmen.
Although Spracklen was a gold medallist at the 1958 Commonwealth Games, his biggest contribution to British rowing has been his guidance of Redgrave from junior through to gold medals at two Olympics, in the coxed four at Los Angeles and in a pair with Andy Holmes at Seoul.
He is not altogether happy with what he is doing.
‘I am British,’ he said.
‘I would prefer to be coaching British crews.
It really hurts me to be going away.’
And he added: ‘It is important to me that the boys know I offered to do it for nothing.’
As well as coaching many of Britain's leading international crews, Spracklen is a key member of the Oxford University team, and he will be returning from Canada in March to look after them for the last fortnight before the Boat Race.
During the 1987 mutiny he was conspicuous in not giving wholehearted support to the then chief coach, Dan Topolski.
In his new job Spracklen could find himself working alongside a former Cambridge coach, Neil Campbell, who guided the Light Blues to their only recent Boat Race success, in 1986.
He faces a large task.
Although Canada won gold in the 1984 Olympics, government funding was cut following the Ben Johnson drugs scandal in Seoul and the country won no medals at this year's world championships.
Hockey Atkins makes sure that Cambridge miss out.
PUNTERS would undoubtedly have marked yesterday's Pizza Express London League match between Cambridge University and Maidenhead for a score draw.
Draw they did, but goallessly, a result that did nothing for Maidenhead but lifted Cambridge to sixth place, writes Pat Rowley.
The lively Priestley, on the right wing, created several Cambridge chances but they were either scorned or Maidenhead were rescued by their goalkeeper Atkins.
Perhaps all three universities in the league were still shell-shocked after being well beaten by the top Pizza clubs last Saturday.
Oxford wasted two penalties in the first 25 minutes against London at Paddington Rec but still prevailed 2-1.
They moved up to 11th place but left London in 17th and last place, without a win this term.

Fighting mars late victory by Cologne.
ABAD-TEMPERED Uefa Cup game between Cologne and Red Star Belgrade last night ended with a last-minute winner for the West Germans, two players sent off for fighting, the Red Star coach involved in an after-match incident with an usher, and fighting between rival supporters.
Cologne, 2-0 down from the first leg in Belgrade, won through to the quarter-finals with two goals from Goetz, his equaliser coming seven minutes from time, and a last-minute winner from Ordenewitz.
Seconds later the referee sent off Red Star's Milos Drizic and Cologne's Uwe Rahn for fighting.
After the match, the Red Star coach Dragoslav Sekularac was involved in an incident with one of the Cologne ushers as he tried to approach the referee.
The Cologne president Dirk Johannwerner said that Sekularac punched the usher in the face.
But Sekularac said he had been pushed by the usher and pushed back after his glasses got knocked down to the ground.
He denied that he punched anyone.
Police detained 14 people when fighting broke out between Yugoslav and West German fans after the game.
They said one policeman was injured in the fighting.
Meanwhile, Red Star's captain, Dragan Stojkovic, has reportedly signed for Marseille for a French record fee of £5.3 million.
The midfielder will join on a two-year contract after the World Cup in Italy.
Werder Bremen knocked the holders Napoli out of the Uefa Cup last night, 8-3 on aggregate after winning the second leg 5-1.
Karl-Heinz Riedle scored twice for Werder, while a half-fit Maradona was unable to keep injury-plagued Napoli afloat.
England and Spain were told yesterday by Fifa that there will be no appeal against the World Cup seedings to be announced in Rome today.
‘There is absolutely no sense in anyone protesting against the decision when it is announced,’ said Fifa's head of competitions, Miguel Galan.
Cricket Chamberlain is TCCB chairman.
By Mike Selvey
FRANK CHAMBERLAIN, the 64-year-old chairman of Northamptonshire, is to become the next chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board, succeeding Raman Subba Row who steps down next October.
At the TCCB winter meeting at Lord's yesterday, the chairmen and chief executives of the 17 first-class counties opted for Chamberlain rather than the only other candidate, Don Perry, the Gloucestershire chairman, and although no one was giving very much away at Lord's yesterday Chamberlain's majority, like that elsewhere the previous day, was believed to be substantial.
So a man who has hitherto led a quiet life, in terms of cricket administration, finds himself thrust into the forefront of the game's politics.
Chamberlain's practical experience of first-class cricket is slim, confined to six matches for Northamptonshire shortly after the war.
Instead his working life has been devoted, as one might expect from that neck of the woods, to the shoe trade, helping build up the family firm into a multinational concern.
He is on the board of a number of City companies, and is a former Master of the Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers.
He has been chairman of Northants since 1985, the year Subba Row took over his role at the TCCB, and has served on the board's finance committee.
Subba Row, who will not have had a hand in this particular decision, sees him as a ‘good scout’.
He will certainly need to be well prepared for the task which faces him, with international cricket politics becoming increasingly complex.
On the home front his business experiences should stand him in more than good stead: cobblers is the stock-in-trade of most cricket committees.
England invited to tour Soviet Union David Plummer greets the arrival at Twickenham of the first Soviet national rugby team to visit the British Isles.
GLASNOST reached Twickenham yesterday when the first Soviet national side to visit Britain startled the Rugby Football Union by inviting their hosts to tour the Soviet Union next year.
The Soviets, who had arrived at Heathrow the previous evening, were taken to Twickenham to train and practise, and it was there that their assistant manager Douglas Kavtalashvilli made the offer.
The invitation greatly surprised the RFU secretary Dudley Wood, who was listening.
‘This has come out of the blue, and we are due to go to Argentina next summer,’ said Wood.
‘But if a formal invitation is issued by the Soviet Union then of course it will be very much considered.’
One possibility is that England could send their B team.
The Soviet tourists' opening game is against Cornwall at Redruth on Saturday, and the tour ends with a match against England B at Northampton on December 23.
The Soviets are largely unknown in the British Isles, but elsewhere they have established quite a reputation as fearsome yet fair opponents.
In particular their student team's victory over New Zealand Universities at the Students' World Cup in France in 1988 announced their birth as a rugby nation.
Not that the Soviets were totally unknown before that.
Their wins against France A, Romania and Italy in the continental competition, the Fira Championship, had been widely reported.
But no great impact had been made on this side of the Channel.
Rugby has been played in the Soviet Union since the end of the last century when a Scottish businessman organised a game between expatriates in Moscow.
But the game failed to excite the Russian elite and was eventually banned by the Tsars as a rowdy pastime.
After the revolution, in 1923, Moscow River Yacht Club challenged the Workers Fitness Club for what was recorded as the first rugby encounter in the history of Soviet sport.
But, for a variety of reasons, the game failed to gain support.
During the Thirties new attempts were made to re-launch rugby in the Soviet Union.
Games were organised as curtain-raisers before major soccer matches, and experts provided the crowd with a running commentary of the action on the Tannoy system, a habit preserved to this day.
In 1936 it looked as if the game had finally made a breakthrough when a national competition, involving teams from Gorky, Minsk, Baku and Moscow, was organised; but someone at the Kremlin decreed that rugby was a capitalist pastime, and the game sank into oblivion once again.
However, despite the setbacks, the game bounced back after the Second World War and, in a similar way to the developments in France and Romania at the turn of the century, it made inroads into Soviet universities.
By the mid-Fifties the game was already established in the Bauman Technological Institute in Moscow where several Romanian students organised two teams and translated the laws of the game into Russian.
The president of the Soviet Rugby Federation is Major General Vladimir Iliushin, a test-pilot hero of the Soviet Union and, like his father — the creator of the famous IL aircraft series — an aircraft designer of international fame.
‘The Soviet Rugby Federation is trying to develop the game throughout the Soviet territory,’ he said.
‘We have about 20,000 players in the country and we run a successful, well-structured league.
We suffer because of the huge distances between various centres and because of shortages of quality coaches.
‘We are also short of money and of playing facilities.
Compared to other sports in the Soviet Union, rugby is a very poor game.
We suffer because we are not an Olympic sport.
In the Soviet Union most funds are channelled into Olympic sport, and because rugby does not take part in the Olympics we get a very small proportion from the budget.’
Several members of the present touring party have made their reputations in the teams which have done so well in the Fira Championship.
The captain, Igor Mironov, is a versatile back of remarkable ability, and the No.8 Alexander Tikhonov, the centre Igor Necheaev and the wing Vladimir Varapaev are all players of considerable class.
Among the less experienced, youngsters like Serguei Molchanov, a prop, and the Georgian full-back Nougzar Dsagnidze were outstanding in the 1988 Students' World Cup.
SOVIET SQUAD: Backs: I Mironov (capt), I Frantzuzov, M Losabezidze, M Parshin, I Necheaev, V Kannna, E Zuev, V Varapaev, I Kuperman, N Dsagnidze.
Forwards: I Khoihlovs, R Malikov, S Molchanov, Z Bakuradze, S Sergeev, A Mishakov, N Plotnikov, A Sokolov, B Koroliov, A Malinin, A Tikhonov, V Negodin, R Khairulyn.
Officials: G Miranov (manager), D Kavtalashvilli (assistant manager), V Masiura (coach), V Grachav (assistant manager), A Yanshin (doctor), A Korshunov (physio).
ITINERARY: Dec 9 v Cornwall (Redruth); Dec 13 v Combined Services (Aldershot); Dec 16 v England Students (Stourbridge); Dec 19 v Northern Division (Aspatria); Dec 23 v England B (Northampton).
Spurs not as gilded as they are painted.
By Tony May
THE Tottenham Hotspur board confirmed yesterday that Terry Venables does not have a large budget for new players because of the high cost of bringing the ground up to the latest safety standards.
The 250 fans who packed the annual general meeting at White Hart Lane gave Paul Bobroff, the company chairman, an orderly hearing.
But there was laughter at his response to a question about a reported split among the directors when he said that the board was ‘united and happy’ with the direction the club was taking.
Bobroff did not deny reports that debts are high after the £7 million rebuilding of the East Stand.
He estimated that executive boxes in the stand would bring in £800,000 a year.
He noted that the club would need to do work on the North and South stands in the foreseeable future.
With the government's membership scheme coming ‘we may have all-seater stadiums for all-member clubs.
We will have no choice’.
Peter Nicholas will be out of the Chelsea team for a month after a cartilage operation yesterday.
West Bromwich signed Graham Harbey, a full-back from Ipswich, for £80,000; Port Vale spent £60,000 on Swindon's centre-back Tim Parkin.
Two goalkeepers switched clubs.
Scarborough's Kevin Blackwell joined his former manager, Neil Warnock, at Notts County for £15,000, and Reading's Gary Phillips went to Barnet for £12,500.
Derby are offering trials to three Trinidad and Tobago internationals, Russell Latapy, Leonson Lewis and Philbert Jones, who all played in last month's World Cup defeat by the United States.
Stan Storton, Telford's manager, has resigned after eight years for family reasons.
He took the club to Wembley three times, winning the FA Trophy this year and in 1983.
The FA is to examine ways of encouraging more professional players to take up refereeing after they retire.
Proposals from the Professional Footballers Association that former players should be promoted more quickly will be considered at an FA referees' committee meeting on December 19.
Tom Hodgson, who led out Luton on their first Wembley appearance in the 1959 FA Cup final, has died in retirement in Hampshire.
He served Luton for 45 years as player, captain, acting manager, director, chairman and president.

Derby are offering trials to three Trinidad and Tobago internationals, Russell Latapy, Leonson Lewis and Philbert Jones, who all played in last month's World Cup defeat by the United States.
Stan Storton, Telford's manager, has resigned after eight years for family reasons.
He took the club to Wembley three times, winning the FA Trophy this year and in 1983.
The FA is to examine ways of encouraging more professional players to take up refereeing after they retire.
Proposals from the Professional Footballers Association that former players should be promoted more quickly will be considered at an FA referees' committee meeting on December 19.
Tom Hodgson, who led out Luton on their first Wembley appearance in the 1959 FA Cup final, has died in retirement in Hampshire.
He served Luton for 45 years as player, captain, acting manager, director, chairman and president.
Mason finds Wills full strength.
By Jack Massarik
GARY MASON, whose avowed game plan is meet the world heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, sometime in 1991, last night found himself in the nearest thing to a test against that granite-hard fighter that his supporters could hope to imagine.
That he won a points decision against the Californian Mark Wills at Wembley will give them some reassurance that the British heavyweight champion could give a reasonable account of himself against an opponent who will not crumple easily.
For, make no mistake, Mason landed a stream of his Sunday-best shots — round-arm right swings, full-blooded left hooks, and accurate short rights — to Wills's chin during the 10 hard-fought rounds.
Those were blows which against most of his previous opponents would have swiftly enhanced his knockout record.
Mason took his unbeaten record to 33 fights by a margin of 98 ½-97, or three rounds, but rarely in a British ring have two heavyweights been so well matched.
Wills, who holds a victory over former world champion Greg Page and was no doubt encouraged by the fact that Derek Williams, whom he had floored and convincingly outpointed in New York this summer, became the new European champion after 55 seconds' work against Hughroy Currie on Tuesday night, went about his work with pride, determination, and remarkable endurance.
During the middle rounds, when Mason still believed one punch could end it, he outjabbed the Wandsworth man and opened a cut over his left eye, but Mason rallied well and the last session in particular left no doubt as to which way the verdict would go.
Johnny Nelson, the British cruiserweight champion, has been given the chance to succeed where his Brendan Ingle stablemate Herol Graham failed earlier this year, and bring a world title to Sheffield — and with home advantage.
The promoter Barry Hearn, expects a full house of 2,500 when Carlos DeLeon of Puerto Rico defends his World Boxing Council title against Nelson at Sheffield City Hall on January 27.
‘Half a million dollars is being spent to bring this fight to Sheffield,’ declared the ambitious Hearn, whose last world title promotion — Michael Watson v Mike McCallum — fell through last month when Watson broke his nose while sparring.
‘I have promised to take big fights all over the country and they come no bigger than a bout with a world title at stake,’ Hearn said.
Nigel Benn's next opponent, part of the Londoner's lucrative five-fight deal with the American promoter Bob Arum, will be the highest ranked middleweight he has yet met.
On January 14 in Atlantic City he faces Michael Olajide, the flashy Liverpool-born Canadian nicknamed The Silk who dabbles in male modelling and was outpointed by Frank Tate for the IBF title three years ago.
Derek Williams, who beat Hughroy Currie for the vacant European heavyweight title on Tuesday night, wasted no time yesterday in throwing a gauntlet in the direction of the British champion, Gary Mason.
‘He gets all the press coverage but right now he is the No2 in Europe and I am the No1.’
JIM COURIER and Pete Sampras (top) lost their opening round-robin match against Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzman in the Nabisco Masters at the Royal Albert Hall yesterday, but they are tipped to make an impact on the doubles game, writes Martin James.
As juniors the two American teenagers were mentioned in the same breath as Andre Agassi and Michael Chang, but neither has made the same impact as yet.
Sampras will finish the year in 81st place, Courier 24th.
But in doubles they have eclipsed their renowned contemporaries.
Though they went down 2-6, 2-6, 6-7 to the experienced Australians, they deserved to qualify for the Masters when Ken Flach and Robert Seguso were forced to withdraw.
In only their second event together they reached the final of the Tournament of Champions in New York, and then won the Italian Open.
‘They are going to be very good but they need to learn to combine better,’ observed Cahill.
‘They hit the ball as hard as almost anyone.’
Courier, aged 19, comes from the same stable as Agassi and has a similar big-hitting baseline game but a more diplomatic approach to court etiquette.
Sampras, an 18-year-old serve-and-volleyer, is equally controlled.
‘We play doubles because we feel it will help us to become more complete players,’ said Courier.
‘It has also brought us closer together as friends,’ said Sampras.
‘It is nice to have someone else of your own age on the tour.
Chang doesn't really talk and Agassi is in a world of his own.’
Yesterday Sampras and Courier were almost in a world of their own.
There were barely 300 people in the Royal Albert Hall when they opened the morning session.
‘It's a stunning setting,’ said Courier, ‘but everyone was so silent it was like playing in a church.
There was no buzz.’
John Fitzgerald and Anders Jarryd, the Wimbledon champions, took nearly three hours to win their opening match 6-3, 6-7, 6-1, 7-5 over Paul Annacone and Christo van Rensberg.
Jarryd then revealed that a troublesome right calf may force him to withdraw from the Swedish team to face West Germany in the Davis Cup final next week.
‘I thought it was getting better,’ he said, ‘but the last couple of days it seems to have got worse.’
Sarah Loosemore beat Jennifer Santrock, ranked 95 places above her, 6-4, 7-6 on the first day of Great Britain's defence of the Maureen Connolly Trophy in Cardiff, but Valda Lake fell apart in the second set against the Australian Open junior champion, Kim Kessaris, losing 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.
