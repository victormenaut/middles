To the green and pleasant?.
Tim Radford reports on the prospects and options for farmers in the next year..
THE British farmer is about to wander into fresh woods and pastures new.
In the course of doing so he could change the face of Britain.
He could grow ‘biomass’ for biotechnology.
He could — in theory — farm for the pharmaceutical companies.
He could diversify into new crops like meadowfoam, lupins, borage, linseed and flax.
In some areas he could plant his land with windmills.
If the climate changes a bit more, he could grow sweet corn in the south and wheat in the north.
He could farm alpaca, deer and wild boar.
He could take up organic farming and selling nurture as nature intended to a consumer market now seriously worried about E numbers and Alar.
He could take up agroforestry; he could convert to timber; he could take up government agency schemes and grow winter grass mixtures for wild geese to graze upon, or engineer his fields to be a home for the stone curlew.
He could grow hedges and wildflowers instead of sugar beet; he could turn his fields into areas of ‘quiet countryside enjoyment’; he could restore ancient coppices and chalk grassland.
He could also go broke — last year, farm incomes fell by 25 per cent.
His land could tumble down to scrub and nettles and eventually untidy woodland.
Or he could sell most of his land to Mr Big and his house and a few acres could fall into the hands of a merchant banker who wants somewhere quiet with a paddock for the daughter's ponies.
Then Mr Big could try diversifying.
But he too would run into the same problems.
Britain is over-producing: there will have to be some way of reducing output.
There is a Ministry proposal called ‘extensification.’
It means that the whole farm has to produce 20 per cent less.
One scheme is already in place.
It is called ‘set aside.’
A proportion of the farm — or for that matter all of it — is set aside, left fallow, mown once a year while the farmer draws a set fee per acre and manages on the rest or gets another job.
Either way, the countryside changes.
There are various calculations about how much land is potentially redundant: it could be as many as three million acres.
For the first time in decades, the nation has a chance to decide what to do with it.
Conservationists, farmers and government agencies all agree that there is an opportunity right now for debate and then decision.
But there is no debate, and any decisions are likely to be taken, piecemeal and by default.
On the horizon is a field of view overgrown with nettles, which no one seems to want to grasp.
One of them is the geography of decline.
Miss Melinda Appleby is environmental policy adviser to the National Farmers' Union.
She says one fear is that land in the hills will become redundant.
‘These are areas where you could say farming was marginal.
As profitablilty declines, they would go out of farming.
There is a big fear in the hills that in order to maintain businesses in the lowlands, people will diversify into sheep, and the profitability of sheep in the lowlands will be greater.’
In fact, the Countryside Commission has just announced an imaginative scheme for 12 ‘community forests’ on marginal urban fringe farmland.
But the community forests — plus the Commission's other plan for 100,000 acres of new forest in the Midlands, which will also soak up redundant land — together with new land released for development, will barely scratch the surface of the problem.
The National Farmers' Union doesn't like the idea of set aside.
In the first place, the scheme only operates for five years, with no guarantee of continuation.
There are also emotional objections.
‘We wish to see as many farmers as possible occupying the countryside,’ said Melinda Appleby.
‘We want to see a working countryside and we don't want to see it fossilised so it's almost like a theme park.’
Farmers have higher hopes of the ‘extensification’ programme in the wings.
Under this, farms would have to reduce output by 20 per cent.
Some farmers are likely to achieve this by converting to organic farming.
To a farmer it's anathema not to produce on land.
Unfortunately, even this won't be enough: the output figures from well-run organic farms are only between 6 and 12 per cent below those from intensive estates.
So ‘extended’ farms will have to leave a wide strip of unsown soil in each field, and let the hedges grow.
But only a few will make the change.
Most will still be farming what they always farmed.
And they still won't feel enthusiastic about extensification.
‘To a farmer it's an anathema not to produce on his land and therefore it's not that he is not being responsible in meeting the challenges.’
Many farmers, it turns out, wouldn't in the least object to making the countryside — their countryside — more attractive.
It depends on what is defined as attractive.
It would also depend on incentives and on some serious stimulus from the conservation lobby.
‘People were extremely disappointed that conservationists could not come up with exciting positive solutions for potential land that might come out of agriculture,’ says Miss Appleby.
Another problem is that the wildlife lobby is divided even over simple things like the future of old farm woodlands.
Most of these were ‘coppiced’— cut to the ground every 20 years or so and then allowed to regenerate.
Should these go back to coppice?
Or be allowed to go on growing?
She goes on: ‘The problem with taking a management decision out of a farmer's hands as an economic decision and putting it into conservationists hands is that the conservationists don't always agree.
‘In the future, it seems, we are going to be taking arbitrary decisions about what we want from the countryside: the large blue here, a certain bird there, and we are going to manage for those species, which will mean that everything else will go.’
The countryside may be changing.
It will go on changing.
The Agriculture and Food Research Council reckon cereal yields could be increased by another 25 per cent this century, freeing even more land.
In a bid to meet the problem halfway, the AFRC has also invested £730,000 in a five-year study of the relationship between wildlife and farming — and what will happen as land use goes on changing.
The point is, that for the first time in decades, the environmentalists have a powerful voice — and a Government which claims to listen.
Three million acres or more of Britain's countryside can't be left to tumble down to nettles, bracken, Oxford ragwort and rosebay willow herb, punctuated by leisure centres and car parks.
Or if it can — there is a case for that too — it might as well be thought about first.
Both the farmers and the conservationists agree that there ought to be a debate.
They also agree that a debate doesn't seem to be taking place.
There is a nettle for a somebody — it might as well be the new Environment Secretary — to grasp.
Stephen Young on the animals that excel in fuel economy Camels do it better.
THREE wise men can't be wrong.
The camel is without doubt one of the natural world's most remarkable forms of transport.
Consider the specification of the average dromedary: a top speed of 650 kilometres in four days under Saharan conditions, a regular luggage capacity of 200 kilograms and a maximum recorded burden of 865 kilograms.
Also fitted as standard: a handy fuel store in the hump and an attitude to water conservation which, if widely adopted, would halve the price of water shares overnight.
Underpinning all these accomplishments is the camel's efficient use of metabolic fuel — a skill put to good use by Mohammed's camel, which allegedly covered the distance between Mecca and Jerusalem in four bounds.
Modern observations are more conservative but no less intriguing.
With such thoughts in mind, three zoologists led by M. K. Yousef of the University of Nevada gathered recently in Australia to investigate the camel's fuel economy.
The focus of their studies was a group of six half-tamed dromedaries, originally part of the feral camel population of central Australia.
The researchers' aim was simply to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the camels under various conditions.
As each beast ambled at its own pace along a farm track, the team collected its breath with the help of a gas-tight mask and a weather balloon.
Analysis of the gas in the balloon told the team how much oxygen the camels were using as they walked.
This figure is directly related to the rate of consumption of metabolic fuel — the camel's equivalent of mpg.
For comparative purposes, the team also took a similar set of readings on human walkers.
Once the zoologists had taken account of the difference in weight, the camels emerged as clear winners.
Over the same distance, people use two and a half times more energy (per kilogram of their bulk) than the average camel.
Although large animals are generally more efficient at walking than small ones — just as trains outperform cars — the camel is in an altogether different league.
It uses less than three-quarters of the energy expected of a mammal of its size.
The camel's metabolic response to heavy loads is no less dramatic.
Most animals increase their fuel consumption in proportion to the extra baggage they are carrying, but not the camel.
With a burden of about 150 kilograms — equal to more than a quarter of its body weight — a camel burns only around 15 per cent more fuel than it burns unladen.
The findings throw fresh light on the camel's former popularity both as pack animal and military mount.
When Alexander the Great looted Persepolis in 330BC, he wisely enlisted 500 camels to carry the booty.
Equally perceptively, Napoleon Bonaparte founded his own crack camel corps after studying the progress of a desert caravan.
As the Christmas story demonstrates, more peace-loving potentates also appreciate the camel's skills.
Zoologists have yet to establish the precise mechanisms behind the camel's fuel economy.
One candidate is the leg musculature, which may turn out to be constructed from slower, more efficient fibres than those employed elsewhere.
Another candidate is the unique stepping gait.
Camels operate each foreleg and its associated hindleg in unison, more like a pantomime horse than a regular quadruped.
This method of progression is unsettling enough to make some riders seasick, but it may hold the key to the beast's endurance.

The greenhouse effect means the world is in hot water.
But how fast and far is it rising?
Jeremy Leggett reports on some cold-comfort clues from the Ice Age, while David Pugh considers the particular dangers facing cities like Venice as sea levels rise The big melt-down to a flood of fears.
THE RISE of sea level predicted as a consequence of global warming has been the subject of some spectacular doom-mongering since the greenhouse effect leapt to prominence.
But as in all aspects of forecasting the greenhouse world, the task of prediction is clouded by uncertainty.
We know with some confidence that if greenhouse gases continue to be emitted in their present quantities, we will experience unprecedented rates of sea-level rise.
But how fast?
Recent issues of the journal Nature have featured new research on the sea-level rise which is likely to give us the biggest clues: the rise at the end of the last Ice Age.
Global sea level was 120 metres below the present level during the Ice Age.
Together with woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers, our ancestors roamed what are now submarine continental shelves.
A phase of global warming which began about 17,000 years ago took us from a glacial world, up to 5C colder on average than the present one, into the equable post-glacial world of the last 10,000 years.
As the world warmed, the global sea level rose at rates which certainly were without parallel in the last 100,000 years, but until this month no continuous record of this sea-level change had been available to scientists.
Now, Richard Fairbanks of New York's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory has uncovered a detailed record which shows how fast global sea level rose at different times during the transformation from the glacial to the post-glacial world.
Like many advances in scientific knowledge, Fairbanks's is rooted in a simple technique.
He drilled through submerged coral reefs off the island of Barbados, looking for the coral Acropora palmata, which can only live within five metres of sea level.
By measuring the trace amounts of radioactive carbon in coral skeletons, which decays at a known rate, he could work out the ages of the corals at different depths in his boreholes.
By subtracting the slow rate at which the planet's surface is rising in the Barbados area, known from previous geological work onshore, he could work out where sea level stood at different times in the past.
Fairbanks found that when sea level first began to rise as the ice sheets melted, 17,000 years ago, it did so at a rate of about 4mm per year.
This is some four times faster than the 1mm per year or so at which global sea level has been rising this century.
It is about the same as we can anticipate in the next century, on the basis of currently predicted rates of greenhouse warming, according to scientists like Tom Wigley, Director of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.
If governments do nothing about greenhouse gas emissions, Wigley's best guess for the resulting warming is around 1.5 to 3C by 2050, which would cause a global sea-level rise of 4 to 6mm per year.
Fairbanks's corals showed him that in the de-glaciating world around 13,000 years ago, a rapid acceleration occurred.
Sea level went up by 24 metres in less than 1,000 years, a rate of more than 24mm per year.
After a period of slower rise until 10,500 years ago, corresponding to a time known as the Younger Dryas — when ice sheets temporarily advanced again in the Northern hemisphere — a second burst of accelerated sea-level risk took place, at rates similar to the previous acceleration.
Where did the extra water in Fairbanks's pulses of sea-level rise come from?
The oxygen isotope chemistry of the corals reflects the composition and origin of the water in which they lived.
On this basis, geologists can be confident that the two phases of accelerated sea-level rise were due to dramatic additions of meltwater to the oceans from melting northern hemisphere ice sheets.
Why should the North American glaciers have melted so irregularly?
One possibility is that the complex wobbles of the Earth's axis as it orbits the sun contrived to produce a peak of solar insolation — stronger than usual phases of heating by the sun — during the two times of accelerated meltwater runoff.
Astronomers can calculate when such maxima of solar insolation took place, and Fairbanks found that his two phases of accelerated run-off do not correlate with the maxima.
He was forced to conclude that there is currently no obvious explanation for why his phases of meltwater runoff and accelerated sea-level rise took place when they did.
Other possibilities arise as a result of further research on sea levels published recently.
John Shaw, a geographer from Queen's University, Ontario, argued in a recent issue of the US journal Geology, that enormous volumes of glacial meltwater must have burst forth from the Canadian ice sheets in cataclysmic floods as they broke up at the end of the Ice Age.
If Shaw is right one such flood must have contained around 84,000 cubic kilometres of water.
Such a volume, Shaw calculated, would have given a rise in global sea level of 230mm within a matter of weeks.
He believes that such vast and unexpected escapes of sub-global meltwater might have occurred a number of times as the ice sheets broke up at the end the Ice Age.
Indeed, he proposes that the myths about ancient floods, common to many cultures, owe their origins to this process.
Would the same principle of sudden and catastrophic meltwater releases to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in the greenhouse world to come?
Dr Mike Tooley, a University of Durham geographer, commenting on Shaw's paper in Nature, drew attention to measured rates of end-of-Ice-Age sea-level rise well in excess of those uncovered by Fairbanks, though sustained over shorter periods.
Researchers in eastern China recorded one peak of 75mm per year.
‘Is there a potential on the Earth now,’ Tooley asked, ‘for catastrophic, subglacial floods raising sea level by 23cm in a few weeks or several metres in a few years?’
Probably not.
But only probably.
And even if not, the lessons from the end of the Ice Age suggest that we are going to need much more than Thames Barriers in the absence of an effective international policy response to the greenhouse effect.

John Illman on The Lancet's humorous side Hitting the funny bone.
The Lancet is known to the public as one of the world's leading medical journals.
It has become synonymous with sober science, if not pompous solemnity.
To its regular readers it is also renowned for its humorous In England Now column, introduced 50 years ago and now the subject of a new anthology.
The thing that is really appealing about In England Now is that self-important, overbearing medical people are still aghast at the idea of a major journal of international repute devoting space to humour.
In fact, the column has provided an invaluable reflection of grassroots medicine, while encouraging successive generations of doctors not to take themselves too seriously.
These are edited excerpts from the book: EXTRACT from medical report form for one of the Big Five banks: ‘For colour vision, ability to distinguish between red and black is the only requirement.’
ONE IS always a bit bashful about asking for blood tests on onself — no one likes to be thought of as a hypochondriac.
However, the margarine adverts having got to me, and the latest atherosclerosis story beginning to look as though it might be true, I succumbed to the temptation of having my lipids (blood fats, including cholesterol) done.
Diffidently, I filled in the form: 40,000 mile service, please.
Alas, like my father before me, my cholesterol is high.
The biochemist's comment was curt: suggest oil change.
AFTER THE end of the last act our host began to sweat and look pale…
A man approached stating that he was a doctor and offering help.
Much relieved I handed over without a word.
Then I began to foresee our mutual embarrassment if events should develop in such a way which would force me to reveal my professional identity.
Very humbly I said how grateful I was, since I was only a surgeon.
‘So am I,’ he said, and departed.
THE OPENING ceremony had been a great success.
The royal personage was gracious; the weather was fine; my speech had been well received; the dinner had been brilliant.
As we went to bed that night, my wife said: ‘I was very proud of you today.’
When I got up next morning, I said to her, ‘Are you still proud of me?’
‘No,’ she replied, ‘I'm all right now.’
HOW FEW of my medical patients behave sensibly when they have their coronaries.
One doctor was being driven home when he suddenly said: ‘Stop the car and let me out’, at which he leapt out and ran off down the road into the dark.
A few minutes later he breathlessly approached the car from the opposite direction, fell into his seat, and said: ‘Well, that's all right.
I had an awful pain in my chest and did not know whether it was a coronary or indigestion.
I thought that if I ran and it was a coronary, it should have got worse, but I ‘ve run round the block and it hasn't, so it must be indigestion.’
PATHOLOGIST, seeking improvement to his department, at staff committee: ‘We must think of our public image.
Of course the mortuary is the shop window of the hospital.’
I HAD to spend some time comforting a distraught mother whose child was thought to have a behavioural problem.
She had just taken him to a psychiatrist who among many searching questions had asked the five-year-old: ‘If your sister is a girl, what is your brother?’
No answer was forthcoming, and no doubt the appropriate score went down on the questionnaire.
The mother came came away somewhat bewildered.
To test my own four-year-old daughter's reaction, I asked her, ‘If your sister is a girl, what is your brother?’
A long pause followed, and then she said tartly: ‘A mouse’.
I said rather disappointedly, ‘Why did you say that?’
The prompt reply was, ‘Ask a silly question and you get a silly answer.’

The Centre for Alternative Technology soon goes public, reports Trevor Blackwell Shares and share alike.
ON January 1 the National Centre for Alternative Technology, one of the focal points in Britain's emerging green network, is going public and eight weeks later will be launching a £1.25 million share issue.
Although there won't be the saturation advertising that usually attends popular capitalism, there will be a prospectus containing a supportive letter from the Prince of Wales, and offers of preferential access to the centre's facilities.
Coming from a group whose aim is the simpler life, such an entry into the market place raises some intriguing questions.
Are we witnessing the next step in the greening of the market, or is it just the latest move in the marketing of the greens?
Five miles outside Machynlleth in central Wales the centre occupies a disused quarry which has been surrounded with windmills and filled with gleaming solarpanels.
Dedicated to demonstrating and popularising alternative, sustainable ways of using energy — sun, wind and water power — it is now the second most popular tourist attraction in Wales, drawing 1,000 visitors a day in the summer.
It also runs practical residential courses on the environment for schools and is constantly consulted for advice and information by industry and individuals.
What makes it so special is the people who live and work there, who don't just talk about the need for alternative technologies, or even just demonstrate workable alternatives but actually live by them.
For the families and individuals this means that they depend for their electricity on what they can generate for themselves, grow much of their own food and recycle their own wastes.
They build and insulate their own houses, draw minimal wages and cook for each other.
So why do they now need £1.25 million?
Roger Kelly, who coordinates its work explains: ‘For 15 years this place has been going through a slow, organic evolution.
What we're experiencing now is a huge upsurge in demand for everything we do.
Reviewing our resources, we've decided to try and influence the relatively large number of people who need something beyond simply factual material about green issues.
We aim to offer our visitors in the nineties a ‘total experience’ that involves all their senses and emotions.’
What this popular environmental education might look like — beyond the existing displays — is elaborated by the centre workers.
The new exhibition of organic gardening, for example, would take visitors first through an electronic display which would simulate a magnified section of the sub-soil with its organisms and cycles.
People would emerge into a sunken greenhouse where organifarming methods would be displayed, and information given on its local practicalities and its world-wide implications.
Up to 20,000 visitors a year will be transported to the site by a new water-powered railway.
Roger Kelly is convinced that there are enough people to invest in the centre: ‘Five years ago this would have been a pipe-dream, but with the rise of the ethical investment movement it's become a real possibility.
Look at Tradecraft, for example, who recently raised £300,000 on its first share issue, and then £1,000,000 on its second.’
The centre becomes a plc on January 1, and launches its share issue on March 1.
The shares will be non-voting ones which means that the workers will keep control.
Kelly concludes: ‘Obviously there are still choices about whose money you'll accept.
We wouldn't go begging to British Nuclear Fuels, for example.
We have to face the fact that there is virtually no money which has a 100 per cent pure source.’
There are some misgivings about the effects the envisaged doubling of visitors will have and the enormous expansion of residential courses.
‘It's always been difficult to let people see what the collective living is about’, says one member of the site community.
‘The truth is that simple things, like eating together, probably contribute more to energy saving than all the machines we use.
But people like seeing new machines and gadgets.
You can't put the community on the displays.’

It'll be all right, make no mistake Daedalus.
By David Jones
JUST AS the calculator has produced its own brand of innumeracy, so the word-processor is generating its own style of illiteracy.
Its speed and ease, says Daedalus, are filling books, papers, journals and commercial literature with increasingly careless and muddled English.
Spelling-checkers, and even the more recent grammar-sensitive ‘style-checkers,’ only give the muddle a little extra polish.
Easy writing is still damned hard reading.
So Daedalus is developing a new word-processing program.
It tries to deduce what, if anything, the author has to say, and then nags him into saying it clearly.
The Dreadco ‘Literary Critic’ seeks clarification of every sentence typed.
‘I thought he died in Chapter 8?’ it might remark; or ‘You said the opposite in line 154,’‘Is ‘boxing’the day, the sport, or the packaging?’and for real puzzles, ‘Do you really mean that?’or even ‘Who he?’or ‘Shome mishtake shurely?’
These seemingly intelligent interjections are, of course, nothing of the sort.
The Literary Critic doesn't understand English; still less does it have any feel for the aesthetics of the language.
What it has is a big dictionary of words and synonyms classified by type (people, locations, actions, etc) and connected by their most likely relationships.
Like other conversational programs, it uses this big database to fit some sort of ‘logical tree’ to the growing narrative, and respond to it from a programmed strategy.
Once it has decided what the text is ‘about’, it queries each apparently new or discordant topic or action, and amends its database from the writer's response.
It marks occurrences with their stated sequence in time, keeps tabs on the ‘cast’ of characters or concepts being discussed, and asks further questions when ambiguities or inconsistencies seem to occur.
Where logically necessary, it generates new linking text, and tries to rearrange the whole assembly of statements into their neatest logical tree.
This relentless nagging and tidying will have an effect out of all proportion to its actual cogency.
For as Socrates knew, a sequence of silly questions is a wonderful way of forcing someone to think out just what he believes and wants to say.
Under the prodding of the Literary Critic, the most shambolic writer should soon sort out his slipshod ramblings into a coherent story, with no unstated assumptions, contradictions, or logical gaps.
It won't be deathless prose, but it should be a grammatical and effective piece of writing.
Self-conscious stylists will hate the Literary Critic.
But the children and students of the electronic age will simply accept it as an effortless and automatic guide to self-expression.
‘How do I know what I think till I've heard what I've got to say?’ they will ask; and, sitting down at the keyboard, will type in a few hasty half-baked assertions, and let the program nag them into developing a coherent and well-expressed thesis.
But the Literary Critic may have its finest effects outside the educational and professional establishments.
Many humbler folk, with fascinating ideas and personal stories to tell if they only dared to sit down and write them out, will be grateful for its tireless and patient tuition.
It will help policemen and insurance assessors to extract sensible evidence from befuddled witnesses, tease effective instructions out of skilled but inarticulate craftsmen, and trick unwary criminals into much completer confessions than they had intended.
