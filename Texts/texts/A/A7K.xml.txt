‘CATHOLIC EDUCATION’
is a marvellous new publication which is specifically for parents of pre-school children, to make them aware of the Catholic network of schools provided for them.
Too often some of our Catholic families are not aware of the existence of our excellent senior schools which provide for a solid Catholic education and a growth in faith for our children.
This publication sets out to remedy that fault and also offers important information about relevant educational changes taking place in all schools, which affects your child.
If you have a child of pre-school age please take a copy home today.

time of Mass on Wednesday.
It will be the Mass which begins our day of prayer and adoration before the Blessed Sacrament.
A day of prayer for the spread of the Gospel and for an increase in vocations to the Priesthood.
The day of prayer at Woodstock will end with Benediction at 8.00 pm.
LAST SUNDAY
in the parish school we held our parish annual general meeting.
It was good to see those there voicing their opinions strongly about various aspects of parish life.
On Wednesday last I had an interview with the Archbishop and he asked me to leave Kidlington and go to a vacant parish in Birmingham (Rednal) where a friend of mine had died recently.
A new parish priest will be arriving here for next Sunday, whose name is Fr John Molyneux.
This is all very sudden, I know.
Its very upsetting in more ways than one and an awkward time for a change of priests so Fr John will want just a little time to settle in and feel at home.
I have been speaking to him on the phone and we have decided that it would be in everyone's interest to postpone First Holy Communion until the last Sunday of term, July 15th.
This will give Fr John time to meet and talk with the children, their parents and teacher.
We also thought that on the feast of St Thomas More, June 24th it would be a good idea to celebrate the feast in the evening in the school hall when we can all gather to meet for the first or last time and say ‘Hello’ and ‘Good-bye’as appropriate.
This therefore will be my last Sunday with you and so I take this opportunity to thank you again for all your kindnesses to me and for the way you made me welcome when I arrived 5 years ago (doesn't time fly!).
Fr John is a lucky man to be coming to this parish.
I am sure that you will give him the same affirmation and support you gave to me when I arrived.
At college he was held in great affection and esteem by his fellow students.
He has a great sense of humour and will keep you all well-amused.
He was our college barber; and at a time when most of us were penniless he cut hair for a shilling (= 5p, to those who do not know what a shilling was).
And so we all had a close shave once a term.
We all called him ‘Mol’ abbreviating his name as students always do; and throughout the diocese he is known by all his brother priests as simply ‘Mol’; and now I gather that his parishioners call him Fr Mol.
I asked him how he would prefer to be addressed and he said you can call him what you please, as long as it is polite.
APF
All promoters are invited to Courtfield, Ross on Wye on Sunday June 10th for the annual reunion.
Arrive anytime after 2.00 pm Bishop Mullins will celebrate Mass at 3.00 and tea will follow at about 4.00 pm.
Courtfield is the HQ of the APF and a lovely old building in a most beautiful spot.
Well worth the journey.
If interested, please contact Margaret 78356, Eileen 4129 or Mona 812134.
CLAY PIGEON SHOOT
A charity clay-pigeon shoot for the Romanian orphans will be held at ‘The Grapes’, Yarnton on Sunday June 17th.
Please tell your friends.

DEAR PARISHIONERS:
Having had the opportunity to settle in a bit and have a look around, I am beginning to get my bearings.
One thing I have noticed is that the exterior of the church is in need of repair and redecoration.
Knowing (from expensive experience elsewhere!) how important it is to keep the fabric in good order, I propose to get this attended to as soon as possible.
We can just about afford it from immediate funds, and I trust I have your support in this work.
Yours in Christ  JOHN F. MOLYNEUX 
‘Sermon?…
Sorry — I haven't finished my colouring in yet!'
Frontier Youth Trust
Advancing the frontiers
News Spring 1990
‘THEY WHO WOULD VALIANT BE…’
Those who are active in frontier youth ministry know they are in a battle.
It's a fight for the well-being of young people who have the odds stacked against them; a fight for their total transformation.
It's a struggle with young people, alongside them as they experience the pleasures and pains, the excitements and disappointments of growing up in a hostile world.
It's a fight against all that dehumanises, blocks and blights those who are made in God's image and don't know their God-given potential in the present and in a future which goes beyond the grave.
The first Christians would identify with this contemporary struggle: the New Testament is peppered with allusions to battle.
They knew that ‘If (anyone) is in Christ he (or she) becomes a new person altogether — the past is finished and gone, everything has become fresh and new.
All this is God's doing, for he has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ; and he has made us agents of the reconciliation.’2 Corinthians 5:17
But, in entering the arena, these early Christians found that,‘Our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers, the authorities, against the power of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.'
Ephesians 6:12
Our Western culture, so heavily influenced by Enlightenment thinking, values and attitudes, has banished any vocabulary which enables us seriously to reckon with the ‘dark powers’.
Others in different cultures and elsewhere in the world have retained the capacity to acknowledge these dimensions of human experience which are beyond the natural and everyday.
The powers and authorities were understood to have particular forms in the first century.
They were known and named — Nero the persecuting tyrant, oppressive tax systems, organised religion which institutionalised sexual promiscuity, systems of justice loaded against the defenceless and weak, customs which outlawed lepers — as well as individuals who misused power for their own ends.
But behind these was known to be God's Enemy variously named as ‘Satan, the devil,(a false accuser, slanderer, calumniator,) the evil one, the ruler of this world, the prince of the power of the air, Belial, Beelzebub, the god of this world, the destroyer, a murderer from the beginning and the enemy.’
Frontier youth workers came up against the destructive, deceptive nature of evil in many of its present forms.
They deal with its expression in individual lives.
Many realise that the young and their families are caught up in and often complicit with a web of interacting forces which hold communities in their grip.
The situations in which they minister are ‘diabolical’ and they feel powerless to do anything about it.
Those whose calling it is to be God's agents of reconciliation are vulnerable to the ordinary wear and tear of any who seek to serve among the wayward and weak, the blocked and blighted among beautiful people unable to realise their potential.
They are also vulnerable to the stresses and strains of a larger cosmic struggle and can become casualties in the process.
This is as true for those who, like those in FYT's full-time staff team, serve God's servants, as it is for those who are at the sharpest end.
In the last three months, which should have seen the culmination of Jubilee Year, a number of things happened which combined to slow and stop the momentum of Jubilee Year.
These have included family breakdown, life-threatening illness, failure of nerve and serious accidents concerning ten of the small full-time team or those closest to them.
Some others holding key roles in a voluntary capacity have experienced unusual pressure.
Perhaps FYT's ministry has more significance than we realise to merit such concerted antagonism!
The first Christians also knew that divine resources were more than a match for the dark powers.
The exercise of prayer and worship takes on a deeper reality when the going is tough.
Passages of the bible have fresh relevance: faith and prayer are effective on others behalf.
God's love and support is known and experienced in the practical care of his people.
Jesus knew that those first disciples, a weak tiny bunch of nobodies, would be powerless and pathetic in a hostile world until they received the power of God in the Holy Spirit.
Easter reminds us that there is no rising without dying, no salvation without suffering.
‘…having disarmed the powers and authorities (Christ) made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.’
Colossians 2:15
Pentecost followed forty days later and there began an onslaught on all that denies, destroys and deceives in human experience which will continue until it is seen that ‘The kingship of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ and he shall be king forever.’
Revelation 11:15
Effective ministry in frontier situations not only requires dedicated skills and energies but it requires us to learn how best to wrestle with the principalities and powers.
The application of good practice is not enough.
We neglect God-given resources at our peril.
‘So put on God's armour now!
Then when the evil day comes, you will be able to resist the enemy's attacks; and after fighting to the end you will still hold your ground.’
Ephesians 6:13
Not only are frontier youth workers part of an enterprise which is global in extent.
We are also key players in a cosmic struggle.
From time to time diate experience into this wider context.
 MICHAEL EASTMAN 
Frontier Youth Trust is a national evangelical movement working to share a common vision of God's concern to meet the total needs of young people.
It acts as a service agency for Christians working with youth, and is concerned to provide opportunities for education, and training, for consultation and referral, and to make known or available information, research and resources for frontier work.
In many parts of the UK members meet in local groups for association, support and corporate action.
Membership of FYT is open to all youth workers, professional or voluntary, and working independently or under the auspices of local congregations, Board, Education Authority or national organisations.
FYT is trans-denominational and has extensive international links through the Scripture Union Movement, with which it has been associated since 1966.

PHILIP TOMPSON — an appreciation
Philip Tompson gave so much of his life to fostering Christian work with young people that it seems invidious to make special mention of one aspect of it.
His contributions included his work with Scripture Union, his long association with Cambridge University Mission, and his leading role with Andy Pierssene in setting up the Oxford Boys' Club Trust.
But perhaps the most exciting years were the early years of the development of the Christian Club Conference into the Frontier Youth Trust for Christian Club Work.
Philip was at the forefront of this development.
As the Club Conference Committee was struggling to express this wider vision in an initial Statement of Aims, it was Philip in 1964 who produced the winning title that we all now take for granted — Frontier Youth Trust.
The Rev E P Tompson was the first Chairman of its Executive Committee and in that capacity led the work forward to the point at which it was accepted as the youth club arm of Scripture Union, and a member of the SU Council assumed the chair.
His work as a leading founder member was invaluable.
It is the more important to record this because he did not seek the public eye.
His key role in creating FYT should not be forgotten.
 Maurice Smith 
A man of friendship, gentleness, integrity, stability, thoughtfulness, strength of character and wise counsel…
GENUINE.
Not only my words to express what Philip meant to CUM, Bermondsey and to our family.
Ringing round some of the ex club members they gave their pictures of Philip: ‘A quiet but firm man, who always had time to listen, and give advice when asked.’
‘I have fond memories of people being able to talk to Philip.
He seemed to just FIT IN.’
‘Philip was one who brought stability and understanding to CUM in camps, houseparties and meetings.
With his quiet and loving manner, he would always listen and wish to know what local people thought before he made any decisions.
He was a rock, and a sounding post for me, and many others, and is greatly missed.’
Philip had the remarkable ability to cross cultures, being at home with the CUMers who often called him ‘Uncle Philip.’
This was a move forward for one young man, who on the first meeting called Philip ‘The grey haired old GIT.’
That was when he was chosen for a ‘crocker’ side.
Philip smiled.
It was pointed out to the young man that Philip was the chairman of CUM.
This instantly gained the desired effect.
‘Alright — That grey haired old BLOKE.’
Philip had a special interest, understanding and affection for the delightful, difficult rogues of CUM who he would always ask about.
He so often searched for the positive, supporting and standing up for CUM and Bermondsey.
 Snowy Davoll 
Philip Tompson pioneered Careforce in the late 1970's.
A group of evangelical youth organisations wanted to find a way to send 18–23 year olds they had been involved in discipling to put their faith to work.
They were to give a year of their energy, time and skills at cost to themselves.
The emphasis was to be mainly on placements in inner city areas.
Philip was 58 when he took the scheme on.
Working alongside him, I was impressed by his energy and capacity for hard work.
He travelled the country on his motorbike, convincing ministers that they wanted volunteers, and young people that they wanted to volunteer on a completely unproven enterprise.
His efficiency was remarkable: keeping record cards of every single visit and replying to letters by return of post.
Philip had a great interest and gift with the young.
He came to stay with my family for Christmas one year.
When my teenage son heard that the visitor was 60 and a bachelor, there was silence.
Philip turned up on his 1000cc BMW in a leather jacket.
He spent hours that Christmas in the garage with my son and the BMW and at the end of his stay, he gave him his leather jacket.
 Clive Boddington 
Many people lost a good friend when Philip Tompson died suddenly and unexpectedly last year.
The memorial service at St Helen's Bishopsgate, when 200 or more gathered, was witness to the wide circle of his interest and special gift of making and keeping friendships alive and fresh.
When FYT was formed in 1964, the high-energy group which gave rise to it needed a chairman who could mediate between differing views and draw differing visions into workable policies.
After the link in 1966 with Scripture Union, he took on the role of secretary instead for several years.
His unfailing support, wide advice, strong advocacy and practical help sustained and encouraged me from my start in September 1967 as FYT's first paid staff person.
He was in the office offering wise counsel, encouraging a forward look a weekend or two before he died.
When he married later in life, Ann shared Philip's interests and friends and became our friend too.
They took pleasure in hosting the reunion lunch on the day of the FYT celebration last October, for many present were known personally to him.
The first 25 years of FYT's life owes more than can be told to Philip Tompson.
He was a good friend indeed.

YOUNG PEOPLE AT RISK
DEVELOPING STRATEGIES
Dr Hoggarth works for Wolverhampton Council as an Assistant Director in the Leisure Services Department, lwth the Youth Affairs and Community Services Division.
She has previously been a youth worker and trainer in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.
All young people are at risk.
Some are more at risk.
All young people are at risk where they are not wanted, despised or feared.
There's a bitterness in the way in which young people are despised.
There is something about adult society which hates young people because of the economic dimension.
It is the feeling that young people are a burden on a society which does not need their labour or even specific skills.
The situation is changing now as young people with skills are becoming more in demand in the labour market with the falling youth population.
Suddenly school leavers are valued.
There are education compact deals.
But those who don't succeed or are not skilled or schooled enough to succeed aren't wanted.
They are seen as a drain on the profit because they don't function in the labour market to produce profit.
And so the resentment is worse than ever.
Klaus Offet, in his book Crisis of Capitalism , says that the Welfare State depends on profit.
The cost of maintaining the Welfare State is rising and coming into conflict with the profit.
There is tension between the two ends of the system.
‘Yobs, hooligans, scum.’
‘We don't want them around us.’
‘They should be put down.’
These are comments about young people which were spoken with a tenor of near hatred at a meeting of a council committee when young people weren't even on the agenda.
‘Scroungers.’
‘Why pay for people on the dole.’
These comments are felt acutely about young people.
There is an expectation that they can earn their way into the labour market but the labour market does not want them.
There is a rump who are dependent on the Welfare State and their place is resented.
There are the ‘golden few’ who win prizes in Youth Training Schemes.
What is risk?— what makes young people ‘at risk’
1)
There is a risk of physical or mental ill health or damage, eg AIDS, prostitution, housing.
2)
Risk of criminalisation.
There is the danger that young people become permanently criminalised.
There is a ‘conveyor belt’ effect and it is almost impossible in the system for young people to get rid of the effect of a criminal record.
3)
There is the risk of alienation.
There is a distance from the State and a lack of control or consent about laws and State government.
The measure of community consent there was no longer affects Government.
4)
There is the risk of permanent damage and neglect to the individual's spiritual life.
Urban alienation is seen as a risk to the State and some projects succeed because they are sold on this fear that no response could endanger the State's stability.
What makes young people more or less at risk?
Dr Hoggarth gave two case studies from children she knew.
These very different characters were both ‘at risk’ in different ways because of the society they and we live in and their vulnerability in different areas: However, both are less ‘at risk’than many because they are growing up loved and taught, ie given information rather than left ignorant and because there is some explanation of faith — relationship with God.
In both cases there is a basic assumption of health — that they can do it.
There is an assumption among many of sickness in young people.
For example, when troubles blew up at the Heath Town Estate in the Midlands they were immediately compared with Broadwater Farm and the place labelled a ghetto in the way the media treated the incident.
Nothing was said about the good, about the thriving community work and the community centre.
There was only an assumption of ill health.
The people there not only had to cope with the incidents themselves but living down the bad reputation.
There is a dynamic about poverty that makes it a risk increaser when it interlocks with other factors.
There is a spiral in the legislation about housing and benefits.
It is difficult to move out from home, to pay for furniture and heat, so young people are almost fated not to get enough money.
They start other things to deal with the debts such as prostitution and drugs.
It's a difficult job to look at the legislation and see a way through it for organisations dealing with homelessness — there is no way through it.
Some young people look upon drugs as a national industry: ‘what is so awful about doing it if there is no other way of getting a job.’
It is easy to see how they argue it — how else would they get a home and a car and some spending money?
It is an industry in the inner city.
In Wolverhampton there is a long-standing prostitution trade.
Nonetheless, it is shocking to see nine year olds involved.
Research links it back to poverty and housing.
Parents allow children to be involved in prostitution because they bring in money.
It's a big step for them to get out of that because they need independent housing and distance from the men controlling it.
How do we break the cycle?
Young people with no job lose confidence and it is easy for them to slide into living in reversal of night and day.
It becomes a colossal step to re-enter working life, even if they are wanted back in the labour market.
It's not beyond some people in churches to lift a phone and get young people up.
Church people all have a role to play.
Drop the competition
Competition is endemic in the Christian world as elsewhere.
It doesn't matter whether people are ‘on the front-line’ or not.
Those that deal with paper are also involved in a job that needs to be done.
There should be no need for people in different roles to compete.
Then there is sectarian competition — over what is evangelical, too evangelical, not evangelical enough.
We don't need to compete like that.
The styles and roles can be complementary.
There are different functions, and the New Testament shows the way that the early church divided them up.
‘In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
So in the daily distribution of food.
So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, ‘It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.
Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom.
We will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.’
Acts 6v1–4
We should respect each other for what we do.
We damage and inhibit what we do because resources aren't shared.
Why bother with that?
Why not share our many resources for constructive mission.
We need the discipline of opening ourselves up to compassion.
Jesus was busy, but he still looked at the crowd and saw them.
Often we don't see them.
Daily life means that we have to stop seeing, for example on the tube.
Jesus allowed himself to see and to be bothered.
It's not a difficult exercise to open up oneself to see.
If you stand on Waterloo Station and look at the faces you will see what Jesus saw — a crowd that was harassed .
This isn't just emotional wish-wash: there is an immediate connection between compassion and discipleship.
In the passage in Mark 10, the incident where Jesus has compassion is followed with the hardest message about discipleship.
There is an automatic connection if one opens oneself up to see.
The trouble is that we don't see.
We can help people by giving them eye-opening devices — ways of seeing.
Assumptions.
We must operate on the assumption of health rather than accept that people are unhealthy.
What are our assumptions?
What is distinct to us or to church work from the assumptions of central Government where funding might direct us to exclude what we want to do and to be a youth service which would deliver a prescribed curriculum.
The Christian community needs to resolve that it won't buy the phrase ‘at risk’ wholesale.
Jesus's view of people is that they are basically healable.
The coming of God's Kingdom involves the restoration of people to wholeness and health.
We need to continually spotcheck that we are living and working in the light of that assumption.
State definitions of needs don't include the opportunity to know about God.
In an increasingly profit-driven state even the most conservative parts of the church have had to distance themselves from some policies.
The gospels show that discipleship sometimes means being at odds with the State.
Management
Industry and local authorities think in terms of‘mission statements’ or customer care.
The purpose of the organisation needs to be translated into management actions.
These can be broken down into organisation of money, time and preparation.
Money.
We need money.
Some things can be done without it but we do need money.
It is sometimes hard to get but it is there.
We have to find management devices which are Christian in ethics to get the money.
A lot is tied up in properties which aren't used but are owned by the church.
We should review the resources we have but don't use and use them for mission.
We should approach the white public school middle class networks in the business world and let them deliver some money.
We don't all need to be in working class inner city areas.
There is a challenge to churches to get independent of State funding.
There is increasing conflict between the church and state funding and we need to free ourselves from wingeing about the cuts.
The church has a mission; let it provide money for the mission.
We must not simply take the victims role.
If we do take a victim's view of ourselves — that we are helpless and it's all impossible — then we won't shift.
And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter.
Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.
For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.
Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.
At the present time your plenty will supply what they need; so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need.
Then there will be equality, as it is written: ‘He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.’
 2 Corinthians 8 v8–14 
The passage from 2 Corinthians reminds us that if the readiness (or willingness) is there, it can be done.
We're asking He who has for what He has.
God asks us for what we have, not what we don't have.
The giving dynamic is not one of patronage but ‘as a matter of equality.’
What equality is there in the giving between suburban and inner-city churches?
This will not be a matter of one-way giving, even though the suburban church has most of the material resources.
Look at what we can learn from the black churches.
It's the giving back of what we have got.
The simple possible is being asked.
Management of People
Two Christian solicitors are needed to represent young people in Wolverhampton and six voluntary organisations are in danger of going under because they need an accountant.
These roles need not be a burden if they were divided up between more people.
‘The phenomenon of the wonderful people’ has hit the church.
We need to share out the wonderfulness and all do a bit— a ‘jobshare of the burnout’— rather than having wonderful people dying on their feet.
Management of things
Transport, buildings and resources: We could share and network these better than we do.
We need to check whether our decisions are made on the basis of making our resources available to others and sharing theirs wherever possible before we strike out independently.
We should question whether the readiness is there, and if not, why not?
Is it a matter of equality: What does the management of mission mean?
Is the church going to be self-preserving or self-sacrificing?
DEVELOPING STRATEGIES: THE PEOPLE, THE PROCESS, THE OUTCOMES
The People:
Among the participants in the consultation, the following churches and organisations were represented: the Baptist Church, the Boys' Brigade, Campaigners, the Catholic Youth Service, Christian Endeavour, Church Youth Fellowships Association (CYFA), Iona Community, Kent County Council, Legge House, Oasis Hostels Project, Wolverhampton Leisure Service, the YMCA.
The Process:
Keith Wright of Legge House and on the FYT Management Group and Arkle Bell, FYT Field Officer and for the South West, began the process with the introduction and initial briefing.
Participants had an opportunity to introduce themselves and their interest in and perspective on the consultation.
It was clear from this point that the agencies represented worked in a huge variety of situations.
Several noted that policy makers were far away from the frontier in their organisations and that this led to obvious difficulties in making effective policies for work with young people at risk.
Small group work and a plenary on examining who are ‘young people at risk’ led into Liz Hoggarth's keynote speech.
This proved to be the catalyst for much of the discussion and also shaped the questions which the self-selected interest groups chose to pursue.
These questions included: ‘I want…to know how to increase provision for young people at risk in my organisation…to raise consciousness about young people on the agenda of my church…to change the attitude of Christians to that of the discipline of compassion.’
Much time was spent in these groups, adopting problem-solving approaches to specific cases from the participants.
This was gathered together in the final session.
The Outcomes:
Participants agreed on highlighting the need for:
independent finance so that Christian agencies can set their own agenda
clear thinking and vision making the underlying theology more explicit for everyone
co-operation with other agencies
money
the release of talents and abilities in the family of the church
resourcing which is flexible and allows individuality to be central releasing the property and other resources which are not being used to their full potential.

FROM THE FRONTLINE
Wimbledon wanderings
The Wimbledon Churches Youth Project are still looking for premises for a young people's advice centre.
After researching the project for a year, Paul Vincent decided to look for premises with a shop front that would make the centre easily accessible.
However, amid rapid development and shooting commercial rentals in Wimbledon, this has not been an easy search.
Paul and Malcolm Bream first spent time exploring possible sources of voluntary funding, and then saw what might be done with the local authority, but have now turned back to their original search for their own place.
The Government's Thompson Report makes specific reference to the need for advice and information work with young people and recommended local authority funding for such projects.
In fact, this theme dates right back to the Albermarle Report of 1960.
Despite extensive lobbying among councillors, their only offer was to share premises with a Citizen's Advice Bureau.
Feeling that they needed their own independence, they have now returned to look for funding from the voluntary sector.
They have now found premises which they are interested in, commercial property in a building owned by Grand Metropolitan, who are asking for £15,000 a year for a property in bad condition.
The project is in negotiation with the owners at the moment, but hope that the prospect of an actual building will encourage sponsors.
Meanwhile, Paul and Malcolm are looking for potential workers, paid and unpaid.
Open home
Phil Mitchell, ex-FYT field officer for the North West, and his wife Lyn, decided a few months ago to open up their home to young people.
He writes, ‘We have seen some remarkable changes in some of the young people who come to our house, the main thing is that we are available, have time and share what we have, which is probably not very much.
A book by Mother Teresa has said much to us about how we are to be for Jesus in this situation.’
Phil and Lyn are both Church Army Captains working in Bolton.
Theos
This summer in Australia, Theos are running seven missions.
Warrnambool is a new mission this year.
Gavin Sharp has started work as the Theos Co-ordinator, having previously worked as an outreach youth worker at Open House in Ivanhoe.
Romsey Mill
Response to the Jordan project appeal to set up a non-alcoholic bar in Cambridge has been excellent.
However, funds for the day-to-day running of the Mill are at a low ebb.
1990 sees the Mill's Tenth Anniversary, however, and various celebrations are taking place including a buffet meal and time of thanksgiving, celebration and praise.
Coke Hole Trust
1989 was a year of great staff change, at the Coke Hole Trust.
Martin Hardwidge, the General Secretary, left in April and Stuart Waddington has taken on that role.
Lorna Payne acted as Director while Barbara Henry was nursing a bad injury.
The Trust is facing a £30,000 debt following higher expenditure keeping Coke Hole up to the standards of the new Residential Homes Act.
Fellowship Afloat and On Line
Fellowship Afloat have good news and bad news.
The good news is that they have managed to install all services — water, sewage, electricity and oil — on their major project developing Light Vessel.
They are also on target to complete installation of toilets and showers by Easter.
However, the rest of the work will not be completed in time for the season, which will make life running a heavily-booked programme of events difficult.
A serious fire on board the barge Memory means that it will be out of action for the rest of the season.
Fellowship Afloat have the use of Dawn, a fully-rigged barge, until the end of April but need another vessel to see them through until September.
Dawn is not ideal even now as it has very limited sleeping accommodation.
Finally, Fellowship Afloat are looking for a new chief sailing instructor.
This is an urgent need.
If you are interested, or know of anyone suitably qualified who might be, apply to the office on 0621 868113 for details.
OK at the OK Club
Just over a year since their financial crisis following cut-backs at Brent Council, the Oxford Kilburn club's target of increased financial aid of £18,000 has been ‘handsomely exceeded’ during the year.
As a result of this the club has been able to run at a constant level of activity.
This figure included a grant from the Church of England Church Urban Fund of £9,000 so a high level of giving is still needed.

AROUND AND ABOUT
NORTHERN IRELAND
Joe Campbell led a ‘Doing Theology’ residential weekend from 23rd–25th March around the themes of justice and incarnation for more experienced frontier workers.
Recently Joe and his wife Janet have been involved in support for couples in frontier work.
Two new pieces of frontier work are being pioneered.
One is a Methodist initiative in Belfast, and the other is from the Congregational churches in County Down.
Much youth work in the region is led by young people and a lot of training is taking place for the leaders of different groups.
Two monthly Saturday sessions on different themes are ongoing.
SCOTLAND
Two practical skills day events for youth workers are planned in Glasgow, for 21st April and 20th October respectively.
In keeping with Glasgow's title ‘European City of Culture 1990’, FYT is organising a day consultation on 29th September for church leaders to explore church cultures.
Four or five camps are being planned for the summer and different ways of leading camps are being explored.
Also, Youth Worker lunches — monthly gatherings at the FYT office — have just been launched.
A series of events is being planned for Glasgow, Falkirk, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
Called Frontier Focus, these times will look at issues of counselling, leadership, training etc.
NORTH EAST
Jennie Appleby is still concentrating her time on the Cleveland area.
A training day is planned for May, further details from Jennie.
The Development Group is continuing to work on raising team support.
YORKSHIRE & HUMBERSIDE
The Yorkshire & Humberside committee is looking forward to the appointment of a new Field Officer.
MIDLANDS
Two day regional conferences are planned in Nottingham (27th Oct) and Birmingham 17th or 24th Nov).
They will be looking at frontier theology and practice.
Terry is hoping to take a Sabbatical at some stage this year.
He hopes to spend time exploring the challenges of ‘spirituality and non-literate young people’ with an emphasis on communicating and sharing the good news, working with the bible and the issue of ongoing nurture.
EAST
The East region committee and supporters were thrilled in early January when the extent of team support for a field Officer reached the target for the first year.
Sadly, Brian Rowe's personal circumstances have now changed and he is not able to take up the post.
The committee express their thanks for the work he has done in a voluntary capacity over the past months.
Two highly successful Scripture Union events in February at Colchester and Newport Pagnell, where committee members contributed, highlighted the demand for a worker.
Watch this space (and People ) for news of the appointment of a new Field Officer.
Meanwhile, networking continues between the widely-spaced workers in the region.
LONDON
At November's ‘Caring for the Carers’ day, Joe Campbell put youth workers in pairs to talk and pray together about their need.
Peter is still in correspondence with one or two people from this session.
He hopes to see work on the issue of support, particularly pairing up with another person.
Work is still going on to raise team support for Peter, and he hopes to be making more visits to churches.
Peter is planning a workshop on training for work with young people in October.
Finally, he is looking out for support material for Christian detached youth workers.
If you know of any in existence, please contact him at the London office.
SOUTH AND WEST
Arkle Bell is engaged in a lot of work training individual youth workers.
In his travels, Arkle will be staffing the Scripture Union stand for the first three weeks of Spring Harvest at Minehead, where he hopes to spend some time with Frank Shayi, SU South Africa's Fieldwork Director.
He will also be involved in a youth event in North Devon.
NORTH WEST
John Hutchinson is writing up an initial impressions report of the work in the region.
He is exploring closer links with Diocesan and other denominational youth bodies which overlap in their aims.
As it is difficult for people to get together, he is hoping to establish a telephone conference system.
The idea is to invite youth workers to ring up onto a party line on a certain night, giving them the theme for discussion beforehand, linking them up with other people to talk about their work.
PEOPLE
After two years of hectic creative activity, Jill Garner left the FYT team where, as Support and Resources Officer, she headed up the Jubilee Year programme and Development Appeal.
On the 1st March she took on wider responsibilities as Head of Scripture Union's Development and Communication Department.
We will miss you Jill!
Without your cheerful, creative and energetic contribution Jubilee Year would have remained plans on paper.
We are delighted that in her new capacity Jill will have a continuing relationship with FYT's public relations and funding needs.
To follow Jill but not to be her successor (who could be!) it is hoped to appoint an FYT Administrative and Resources Officer — see Sits Vac for details.
There is also a vacancy for a Field Officer in Yorkshire and Humberside — see Sits Vac again.
Brian Rowe has relinquished his role as Eastern Counties Field Officer so that he can concentrate on developing the Salt Cellar as a joint churches enterprise in Sudbury.
He remains on the Eastern Counties Committee and General Committee.
This has created a vacancy for a full-time post in the Eastern Counties, for one year initially.
Contact Michael Eastman for details of this post.
A part of the Jubilee Appeal funding has enabled Jennie Appleby to take up the half-time paid post of North East Field Officer, for a year in the first instance.
Margaret Hunter's appointment in Scotland is ongoing.
Monica Dunnell, Terry's wife, is gradually recovering from an acute infection.
Elizabeth Stacey, secretary in the FYT City Road office, has broken her leg again.
Sheila Eastman is making good progress with her chest condition.
Please pray about illness in the FYT family.
Mark Ruston died recently.
Long-time Vicar of the Round Church in Cambridge, he was a strong supporter of Frontier Youth Trust in its early days.
MONEY MATTERS
So far the Development Appeal is doing well.
A total of £76,000 has been promised over four years of which £57,000 is in hand now.
Some of this has been given by grant making trusts to specific projects.
The Appeal is running over into 1990 and a further Appeal leaflet is being produced.
Of the £43,600 unallocated, £30,100 has been received so far.
It is hoped that some of this will go towards special development project for the north east so that Jennie Appleby can come onto the staff on a more permanent basis.

The Rector's Letter
Dear Friends,
We are most grateful to those of you who prayed for us on our recent visit to Zimbabwe.
Both the Bishop and the parish (St Mary's, Avondale) in Harare were obviously keen to have us and our visit helped confirm to us that this seems to be the Lord's next step for us.
Accordingly, subject to work permits being forthcoming, I have accepted a post as Rector, and Elizabeth as a Diocesan Counsellor with special responsibility for helping with the problems of AIDS.
We do not expect to arrive there before January.
General Synod
In consequence of this move, this month will be my last attendance at the General Synod.
It has been an experience which I have enjoyed.
Please pray that godly and suitable people will be chosen to help steer the affairs of the Church of England.
The new Synod to be elected at some date in the autumn will have the ticklish task of negotiating the issues about ordaining women to the priesthood.
The House of Laity is elected by your Deanery Synod members.
One of the topics being raised at the coming General Synod in a Private Member's motion is the whole question of our treatment of animals, and I include an article about this.
Michael Mitton
Michael will be visiting us to preach on July 22nd.
He is the new Director of Anglican Renewal Ministries and successor to Lawrence Hoyle who has preached for us more than once.
Although the Spirit of the Lord has permeated the church through what is called ‘charismatic renewal’, and although it is like leaven in a lump which has begun to spread its influence, there are still many parts of the church unreached and unaffected.
Michael believes that ARM still has an important role in continuing the impetus of renewal and I am sure we will find his ministry an encouragement.
He is the author of two booklets and has a keen interest in meditation.
As ARM will I hope be  leavening the church, so the church is meant to be like  salt and light in the world.
The salt must be rubbed or soaked into the meat to preserve it.
We need to be ‘in the world’ but not ‘of it’.
We need to be shining lights in the darkness.
Yours sincere friend  David Bishop 
Animal Rights
I must confess to being a ‘convert about this matter.
Not that I have ever believed we should meekly accept unnecessary cruelty to animals, but having an agricultural background I have wanted to avoid taking a sentimental stance.
The behaviour of some animal rights supporters, who have sometimes appeared to care more for animals than they do for men and women, has also not commended their cause.
However, I recently received some literature about the appalling treatment of dogs and cats in South Korea where they are apparently regarded as a gourmet food.
The article included a suggestive phrase —‘If people are kind to animals, they will probably be kind to each other too.’
The author may or may not be aware of it, but he is stating a biblical principle.
In Dt. 25:4 it is decreed that an ox which is working should not be muzzled but allowed to eat.
Paul uses that very declaration in 1 Cor. 9 v 9–10 to demonstrate that God's concern for animals is paralleled by His concern for men and women.
Indeed it could be interpreted that His concern for humanity is a reflection of His concern for animals.
Similarly in 1 Tim.
5 v. 18 Paul uses a prescription about animals as grounds upon which to pay a church worker a decent wage.
There is a great deal of man's inhumanity to man as evinced in the use of torture on political prisoners or the application of apartheid to other races.
There is also much unnecessary hardship and fear and pain caused by man to animals in the way we breed them, market them, or eventually kill them in an abattoir.
I believe we should support responsible organisations campaigning on behalf of animals for two reasons:
1.
It is intrinsically a just cause;
2.
It may have rippling effects and result in more general kindness throughout society.

Everyone is welcome, breakfast is provided.
BE THERE!!
Pathfinder & Explorer Ventures
It is very pleasing that 14 children and 7 adults, plus two former members of St. Clements are going on a Pathfinder of Explorer Venture this year.
A ‘venture’ is more than a holiday with a Christian emphasis.
In John 10 v. 10 Jesus says that He came so that‘you may have life, life in all its fullness’.
Well, life on a Venture will be ‘life in its fullness’ for most if not all of those attending.
For me and for many, a personal relationship with Jesus started on a Venture (they were called ‘camps’ in my day!) and attending and serving on a venture were valuable stepping stones towards greater Christian maturity.
When you pray for us please pray that not only will we all have a safe, energetic yet relaxing holiday but that during the course of the venture our faith in and walk with Jesus will be deepened.
We will let you know in the September magazine just how good the Ventures were and what went on.
At Wimborne, Dorset from 30th July to 6th August.
Leaders: Simon & Judith Weedon, Gabrielle Willson, Nick and Chris Grew with Rebecca Prittie, Joel Prittie, Isobel Burnie, James Cook, Naomi Cook, David Chapman, Elspeth Grew and Ben Broad.
At Porthpean, Cornwall, from 30th July to 7th August: Sam Jones and Jonathan Grew.
At Chichester, Sussex from 11 August to 18 August:
Leaders: Ian and Caroline Johnson, Oliver Elphick, Steve Radley with James Chapman, Tom Elphick, Rachel Shaw, Pippy Shaw (plus Hannah Elphick, Joanna Johnson and Mark Johnson).

Then come along and help at Secret Agents, our 5–11 year old Holiday Club this summer!
WE NEED YOUR HELP!
How?
1.
By praying that many children from the local area will be drawn to the Holiday Club and the Church, with their families, and ultimately to faith in Jesus.
2.
By providing the necessary ‘junk’(boxes, washing-up liquid bottles etc.) to make our craft activities less costly.
For details of what is actually needed, please see the list at the back of the church or an identical one in the Family Centre.
3.
By providing practical assistance on one or more mornings to lead or help lead craft, drama or games activities.
4.
By helping to run a creche for the under 5's of parents who are helping.
5.
(If you live in the parish) by displaying a poster encouraging children to come.
6.
By coming to a Family day on the Saturday, to meet and welcome new families to the church.
7.
By coming to the special Family Service on Sunday, also welcoming families new to St. Clements church.
8.
By volunteering to help in follow up activities planned for the autumn — perhaps a weeknight club for children, nurture groups for children and/or adults; we shan't know exactly until after the club has finished.
Secret Agents?
Secret Agents is the name given to a Christ centred, bible based holiday club resource material from Scripture Union.
Some of its ideas will form the basis of our club.
The programme aims to stimulate the children to find out the truth about Jesus through the eyes of His enemies, the Pharisees and the ‘secret agents’ that were often sent out to investigate and police His teaching and activities.

Kitalya Prison Farm
Ten years ago, Kitalya prison farm was the premier facility of its kind in Uganda.
Its 600 prisoners cultivated enough food to supply all the region's prisons.
Surplus yields were sold in Kampala's markets and reinvested in prison infrastructure and facilities.
Today, following years of civil war, it remains a shadow of its former self, with its buildings devastated and only 10% of the farm's 1000 acres under cultivation.
Last year the Ministry of Prisons, in Kampala, approached Food for the Hungry (an international Christian relief organisation) with a request for help.
They responded with blankets, clothes and seeds which have made a considerable difference to the prisoners' quality of life.
However, a great deal of work remains to be done to restore the prison's vitality.
Food for the Hungry UK are sending a team of volunteers to help with the rebuilding.
The aim is two fold, not only to rebuild Kitalya, but also to build relationships with staff and prisoners to share Christ's love.
As you may have heard, I shall be joining the workparty from July 27th–August 15th.
As a nurse, I shall also be acting as medical officer for the group.
Personally, I am hoping the trip will also provide me with an insight into relief and development work as I pray about my future.
I would very much appreciate the prayer support of the church, particularly for the following:
a)
that the Holy Spirit would use us to communicate the love of Jesus:
b)
for safety — we're 40 miles from a hospital:
c)
for strength — I fear I shall find it difficult in the heat:
d)
for finance — air fares to Africa don't come cheap!
 Clare White 
Russian Visitors
As you may have heard me mention already, I am involved in organising a one month summer school for 40 soviet teachers of English this July.
Half the programme will concentrate on modern teaching methods, but the other half aims to give participants opportunities to observe a range of aspects of British life.
Many of last year's group were interested in going to a church service, so this year I have arranged to bring them to the morning service at St. Clements on Sunday, 15th July.
It would be wonderful if after the service people would be willing to invite 2 or 3 Soviets into their homes for lunch.
They all speak excellent English and going on last year, are so pleased to be in Britain and so appreciative of everything arranged for them that they make an easy and rewarding group to entertain.
Please contact me if you are able to help.

Beyond the Parish
Did you know about the local CMS Vicar (featured in ‘The Door’) who visits the caravans of motorway workers?
We prayed for him in June.
Come to our prayer group in July and find out which old and new friends we'll be praying for then — and bring your own suggestions and concerns.
Monday 2nd July 8.00 pm at the Family Centre.
It has been suggested that we might put our prayer list on the Overseas Board in church instead of the monthly missionary society's display, or as well.
What do you think?
This isn't a poll — we're only asking.
But do come and tell us your views.

An Invitation
Peter Moger is getting married at Merton College Chapel on 21st July, and would be delighted if any members of the congregation would like to attend.
The invitation is for the service only (which is at 12 noon), since the numbers at the reception are limited by both space and budget.
A night with the Pathfinders
At 8 o'clock on Friday, June 15th, over 30 teenagers met in the church Family Centre for a strange ritual known only to a few as MIDNIGHTICESKATING.
This strange and very tiring event, designed by the church youth worker, began with a series of strange and tiring games.
After a short time, some of the braver members of the group drew up their courage to watch West Germany v The United Arab Emirates on the portable black and white that had mysteriously disappeared from the bedroom of 43a St. Clements and reappeared in the canteen room of the Family Centre.
Others, mainly the girls, spent the next hour or so exercising the jaw muscles — until the great white chief shouted, ‘OK; time to get together’.
The troops were given their briefing in the hall.
The girls would sleep in the nice rooms, while the boys would have the canteen.
It was now 10.00 pm, so in 3+ hours they would all be woken and taken by fathers (mainly volunteered by their wives) to the of the action — the place known as Oxford Ice Rink.
There they would meet some others, who would join them for the next stage.
All those who wished, could then skate from 2–4 am.
Then upon completion of the mission, all would be returned to the Centre, to sleep.
Breakfast would be at 8.00 am and parents would return to collect their offspring at 9.30 am.
For the rest of the day all teenagers would be very grumpy and drive their parents up the wall.
The troops reluctantly went to their beds, among them a number who had never been to Pathfinders before, and others who were returning after a time away.
With the help of Captain Audrey Couper and Commander Ian Johnson, Private Wensley got them to stay quiet.
The leaders then sat back to watch ‘Godzilla’ on a late night B movie slot.
The time had come.
The girls were awakened and taken across in the first convoy, the boys in the next.
Skates were tied on the wrong feet; some boys were trying to remember when they had last changed their socks; the smell was incredible.
The first steps on the ice were amazing.
Now 45 people had joined together for 2 hours of fun.
The only failure came when Jon Wensley refused to skate (coward!!).
Watching Richard Arthurs was a lesson to us all, but what could be said about Ian Harrison?!
The return to the Centre was completed without mishap, and very little sleep was had from then on.
Most people were kept awake by Jon Wensley telling them to go to sleep.
Breakfast was eaten in relative silence.
Everyone was away by 10.00 am.
I'm sure all were grumpy all day.
How the boys could play football from 8–9 am I don't know — it was totally unforgettable!

THE OXFORD CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE FOR COUNSELLING
11 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS Telephone: 0865 58154
Introductory Course in PASTORAL CARING 1990–1991
The Institute will be again offering an introductory course in Pastoral Caring, to help those with some experience of pastoral caring or counselling in their churches or fellowships to develop their gifts further.
The course aims to help participants:
towards a Christian appreciation of various approaches to pastoral care and counselling
to recognise some of the more common personal and congregational problems
to develop some basic skills in dealing with them
to serve in their local churches more effectively
The course does not train course members to become accredited counsellors.
WHEN?
The evening sessions of the course will run fortnightly from 4 October 1990 to late March 1991, with a break over Christmas: all evening sessions will run from 7.30 to 10.00 pm.
The evening sessions before Christmas will be on Thursday evenings, and after Christmas on Wednesday evenings.
In addition to the evening sessions there will be four ‘away-days’ on Saturdays (from 10.00 am to 4.30 am), which give the opportunity for some extended skill-training and group-work (an additional ‘away-day’has been included this year).
We expect the away-days to be 13 October and 8 December 1990, and 19 January and 16 March 1991.

PARISH NEWSLETTER
SUMMER 1990
The Canterbury Stakes
The bookmakers are having a field day, so it seems, on the ‘Canterbury Stakes’.
If the Church and secular press is anything to go by, a period of intense lobbying has begun with the various groups and interests within the Church of England backing their preferred candidates, or perhaps as significant, blacking others.
To the outsider, it must all seem very undignified.
Such lobbying has always gone on, but now with closer media scrutiny, things are more in the open.
How is an Archbishop or Bishop appointed?
Nowadays, with Synodical government, the Church has a greater say in the appointment of its leaders — well, in theory at any rate.
A body known as the Crown Appointments Commission, which has strong representation from the General Synod and from the diocese where there is a vacancy recommends two candidates to the Prime Minister, who in turn recommends them to the Queen who makes the appointment.
There is, of course, wide consultation at each stage, and in theory the Prime Minister or the Sovereign can reject the Crown Appointment Commission's recommendations.
Lord Callaghan, when he was Prime Minister, made the point that he was not necessarily going to be merely the post box in the system.
This arrangement has existed since the mid 1970s.
Before that, appointments were made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day.
Again there was wide consultation both within the Church and outside it, for Archbishops and Bishops are not just figures of local importance but have a national importance as well as leaders of the Church of the English People.
However, it is a moot point as to how representative of the Church of England the General Synod is, or indeed any other of the layers — Diocesan or Deanery.
And, as a result, how far does the Crown Appointments Commission reflect the views of the Church in making its recommendations?
One detects a certain apathy towards the whole business of synodical government, and parishes find it difficult to fill the vacancies allotted to them on the Deanery Synods.
One of the results is that synods have become the happy hunting ground of activists of one kind or another, and thus have become removed from the concerns of the ordinary man or woman in the pews.
Perhaps, if one was able to give advice to the Prime Minister on the appointment of the next Archbishop of Canterbury, it might be: Take your own soundings and make your own recommendation to the Queen.
Of course there will be howls of protest from the synodical activists and the liberal establishment, but the man or woman in the pews who are the real Church of England will thank you for it.
PS.
If anyone admits to taking the Tatler, they will find that one of the Clergy of the Parish, Dr William Oddie has contributed a major article in the June number on the appointment of a new Archbishop.
Heating St John's
The Diocesan Advisory Committee and the local Planning Authority have given the go-ahead for a Faculty from the Chancellor of the Diocese to install a new heating system in St. John's, and hopefully, it will be in and working by the time next winter comes.
As part of the fund raising towards the cost of this heating system, we are holding a Bring and Buy on Tuesday, 10 July in the Church Hall from 11 am.
Ploughman's lunches will be available.
Closure of the Vicarage Drive
The Vicarage drive and Church forecourt will be closed to the public as a through way between Wytham Street and Vicarage Road on Monday, 27 August, 1990 (Bank Holiday Monday).
This is required by law a) to maintain the private status of the ground, b) to preserve the Vicar's freehold rights of ownership (and those of his successors) and c) to prevent the creation of a Right of Way through the grounds.
Access to the Church and Vicarage will be through the Wytham Street entrance.
Crosslink Youth Club
Garden Party: This very pleasant annual event will take place on Thursday, 12th July at the home of Miss Nellie Millards, 21 Vicarage Lane at 6.30 pm.
July 8th: Punting at Cherwell Boat House — meet there at 7 pm.
Cost £1.00 per person, Crosslink will make up the difference.
Bring towels and spare clothes, if you intend to the same as last year!
14th Oxford St John's Cub Scouts
Are holding a Summer Fare on Sat 14th July at the Church Hall.
Lots of events including Tombola and water pistol shooting.
Cake and white elephant stalls plus a grand prize draw.
New Hinksey School
At this year's May time celebrations all of the children performed country dances and a special feature was dancing around a Maypole by the children in Miss King's class.
The work in the school this term is centred around the theme of the ‘Natural World’ and ‘Living Things’.
You may see groups of children around the community studying water life or bird watching.
On Sunday 24th June the school will have a stall at Fun in the Parks and on 13th July they hold their summer sports races and summer fair in Hinksey Park from 1.30–3 pm.
Do come to some or all of these events.
Parish Holiday
One Double Room is still available for either a single person or a couple.
Price £37.00 per person.
Must have own transport.
If you are interested please ring Valerie Claridge (723507).
MISSIONS, MISSIONARIES & Young Churches, Autumn 1989
Prayer
Lord, make me an apostle of your faith.
Where there is the darkness of unbelief, let me spread light; where there is the hate of social strife, love; where there is the error of heresy, truth; where there is the frustration of sin, forgiveness; where there are Muslims, devotion to Mary.
Grant that by my prayers and alms, I may give to each continent what it requires: to Africa, a native clergy of black hands lifting your body; to Asia, a rich harvest from the red blood, seed of her martyrs; to Oceania, a necklace of islands made into a Rosary for the faith; to Europe, already so tired, a renewal of youth at the altar of God; to America, an exchange of the pearl of great price for material riches.
Let me send my offerings where I cannot go; my pains to comfort sufferers whom I will never see; and my sacrifices to help plant the Cross in lands that know not yet of the Crucified.
I ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen 
Cover Picture: Korean seminarian wearing a T-shirt decorated with the Eucharistic logo.
Editor: Fr John Corcoran
This issue's cover features a Korean seminarian wearing a T-shirt bearing the emblem of the Eucharistic Congress which will be held in Seoul from 5th to 8th October.
A brief history of the Korean church is printed in ‘Here and There’ on page 20.
It is a church of martyrs and a fitting host for the 44th Eucharistic Congress.
That the Congress is held in Korea following Kenya in 1985 illustrates the growing significance of the young churches.
The picture of the seminarian reminds us too of the quite amazing increase of vocations in most of the young churches.
The Church in South Korea has 1,212 local priests, only 222 missionaries but an amazing 1,341 major seminarians.
More seminaries are needed here and in many other countries.
The young churches do not have the money to build them and so they quite rightly look to us Catholics of the rich countries of the world.
Here the bridge between us is the Society of St Peter Apostle, whose hundredth birthday we celebrate this year.
Full details of what promise to be uplifting and enjoyable celebrations are carried on page 4 and the back cover.
In Africa visitors are looked upon as a blessing and people go out of their way to meet them and make them feel truly welcome and at home.
Please help us to do the same for our visitors: Cardinal Arinze at Westminster Cathedral at 1.30 pm on 22nd October, and Father Michael Toror, Brother Karl Gaspar and Sister Bernadine at the various churches listed on the back cover.
The prayer opposite was composed last year by deacons on retreat before they were ordained priests and missionaries.
They are Nigerians, members of the all-African Missionary Society of St Paul.
A similar society, the Apostles of Jesus, is flourishing on the other side of the African continent, in Kenya.
As we pray this prayer we join with those generous young men as they set out on their missionary journeys.
The Missionary Society of St Paul was started by the Nigerian Bishops in 1977.
Already the Society has 29 priests and over a hundred seminarians.
‘Fifty Years Ago’ on page 19 reports the joy that was felt when the first three African bishops of modern times were appointed.
How the wheel has turned.
Nearly all African bishops are now sons of Africa and they are sending out their own missionaries.
Supporting missionaries and young churches by prayer is asked of all APF members.
Father Michael Hurley begins a series of articles on prayer on page 14.
Please remember too all our deceased members and especially those whose names are listed on pages 22–23.
On page 23 too there is a picture of Carol McMahon who is generously giving hours of her time patiently illuminating a new Book of Remembrance for Eccleston Square.
When finished it will lie before the Lord in our chapel.

Centenary
This year the Church celebrates the centenary of the society of St Peter Apostle, the SPA.
In 1988 the Bishop of Nagasaki had to turn away young Japanese men from the seminary because he simply could not afford to keep them.
In desperation he wrote for help to Europe.
Mother and daughter, Stephanie and Jeanne Bigard responded.
They urged friends to join them and so the Society of St Peter Apostle was born a hundred years ago in France.
The Society supports the young churches in their task of training their own priests and religious.
In addition to building seminaries and other houses of study it helps to support over 63,000 seminarians.
Contrary to Europe, the young churches are experiencing a vocations boom.
These young men and women are sorely needed in rapidly growing churches which are supported less and less by Missionaries from Europe and North America.
The SPA is, if you like, a bridge.
A bridge between us who have the money and the young churches who have the vocations.
Our celebrations will open with a Mass in Westminster Cathedral at 1.30 pm in the afternoon of 22nd October, Mission Sunday.
Cardinal Hume will be the principal concelebrant; the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio, Archbishop Barbarito, will concelebrate with bishops from England and Wales.
Representatives of Missionary orders will also be present.
Cardinal Arinze will preach the homily.
Cardinal Arinze is a Nigerian and is the head of the Pontifical Council for Inter Religious Dialogue in Rome.
All friends and supporters of the Missions and the young churches are most welcome.
Do come with a friend.
Better still, bring along a coach from your parish.
Let's pack Westminster Cathedral and celebrate the Catholicity of the Church.
Further events in November are listed on the back of the magazine.
22nd October — Mission Sunday Mission Sunday is APF Day.
Celebrate it in your parish.
Come to Westminster Cathedral!
Solemn Mass at 1.30 pm.

MALM SOW
Father Eugene is a Burmese priest.
He belongs to a minority tribe, the Karen, and in a Buddhist land he follows a minority religion.
To the Burmese he is ‘Malm Sow’, the man in the white cassock who serves the ‘bearded God’, Jesus Christ.
His days are spent travelling by boat ministering to the Catholics in his scattered parish.
The pupils provide their own food by keeping a cow, a couple of fish ponds, a large vegetable garden and some hens.
But Fr Eugene is also a missionary, and spends many hours with Buddhist monks talking of Jesus Christ and Buddha.
‘We do not want to destroy Buddha but to christen him.'

‘You have no famine, we have no famine’
Anne Marie Coppock
As a member of a Faith and Justice group in Burnley I knew Father Corcoran before he returned to Kenya in 1986.
He invited me to go and see the Church in Africa and fortunately I accepted his invitation before he was recalled to become the APF director.
His mission was called Aluor.
It lies exactly on the Equator near Lake Victoria among the Luo people and in the Diocese of Kisumu.
The first thing you learn up in Kisumu is that none of the churches are large enough to hold the large congregations attending Mass.
And the second thing is just how enthusiastic everyone is, when celebrating Mass.
The music is lively with drums and dried bean shakers.
To my mind the Luo are on a par with the Welsh because everyone sings.
And the offertory processions are gay and colourful with young girls dancing and many gifts, including chickens, sugar cane, bananas and eggs, brought to the altar.
Even in those large congregations all the bidding prayers are spontaneous, beautifully prayed and with everyone obviously listening to what was being said.
It was strange not being able to communicate but someone who could speak English was always on hand to translate and often all I needed were those wonderful smiles and greetings from people.
Aluor was a busy mission with development projects, many women's development groups, new chapels being built, a small hospital and a marvellous school for blind children run by African sisters.
But it was the Church which really fascinated me.
Much of Fr John's time was also taken up visiting his outstations and taking Mass and the sacraments to the people who were visited every three months.
So I just tagged along in his pickup truck happy to share for a little while in the spiritual life of his huge parish.
I was always greeted with warmth and affection.
Always at the Bidding Prayers mention was made of me and my Christian community at home and prayers were offered for them.
And after Mass, accompanied by great hand shaking I was asked to pass on thanks to the Christians in Salford for their support but mostly great thanks for sharing our priest with them.
Many of their young men are going forward to train as priests, and at some time in the near future the people will be ministered to by their own men.
Until that day comes it is essential that other Christian communities support them.
The work of the priest in Kisumu is extended and shared by the catechist and leaders in the parishes and outstations.
Without the work of these dedicated men and women the Church could not progress as rapidly as it does.
Maurice Ododo is the catechist at Aluor mission and every day was busy going near and far training and teaching the Christians, preparing them for the Sacraments and instructing catechumens.
Par of his work also was to prepare couples for marriage.
One thing that struck me was the great need to bear children.
I myself have five children and in England this raises an eyebrow, but in Kenya I was often asked would I be having another soon.
And frequently women would express to me their need to be pregnant again.
Passing on life to another generation is seen as a great privilege and joy.
And it is important that the west does not crush this African life-style with our selfish talk of over population.
England and Wales are many times more populated than Kenya.
What is needed is generous help to ensure their children survive and aid systems which really are of benefit to the people.
So much of our aid is given with strings.
(Take our aid, but you must promise to buy our goods and especially weapons.)
And also we must be prepared to pay a realistic price for their goods — coffee, tea and sugar etc.
There was so much going on all over the mission, more often than not organized by the people themselves.
I remember mostly the great joy and vitality of the churches and communities I visited.
The liturgies were wonderful, and in small crowded mud huts great praise and thanksgiving was offered to Almighty God.
Their greatest joy was to have a priest with them to administer the sacraments and say Mass.
Things we take so much for granted.
And most striking was their simplicity and lack of greed.
One day while out visiting with Father John a man asked me how things were in my country.
Had we any famine?
Through an interpreter I replied that things were well and we had no famine.
To our western eyes as he stood in his raggy, holed clothes in front of his mud hut he would appear very poor.
But he raised his arms to Heaven and said, ‘Praise God, you have no famine and we have no famine.
God is good.’
For me this is the message of Kenya — Praise God.
I was for a short time privileged to share in the joy and vitality and the oneness with Almighty God in his Luo people (Anne Marie will gladly give a talk and show slides to any interested groups in the North West.

‘Courtfield Weekends’
Father Frank Thompson MHM
Courtfield was the happy family home of our founder, Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, whose mother, Eliza, spent an hour a day praying for religious vocations for her thirteen children.
Though she never lived to see the day, six of her sons became priests and four of her daughters nuns.
In its idyllic surroundings of the Herefordshire Wye Valley Courtfield has become a natural haven of peace.
Ten years ago it was thought that something positive should be done to encourage and thank our faithful and hardworking Secretaries and Promoters.
Weekend retreats were decided on and Courtfield was the obvious venue for the South West.
Over the past eight years hundreds of Promoters, in groups of thirty-seven, have spent relaxed, enjoyable and richly rewarding weekends with Father Michael Hurley our ‘retreat master’ and myself.
Each weekend begins on Friday evening with supper, followed by an introductory talk, film or video, night prayers and then the freedom to sit and chat or go to bed.
Following morning prayer there are ‘talks’ and lively discussion with Fr Michael and after lunch a ‘working session’on the APF with myself.
Holy Mass is in the evening and I can only say that the warmth of the presence of God is felt.
The evening is given over to mission experience through film or slides, then night prayer followed by a social evening.
There is even a bar!
Sunday is usually a day of urgency — talks, Mass, lunch, conclusion, benediction and sad farewells follow in quick succession, and yet people feel uplifted and refreshed.
In Eliza Vaughan's day it was said of Courtfield: ‘You nearly break your neck going, but more nearly break your heart leaving there.’
Today the roads have much improved but, as many letters from participants testify, the leaving hasn't changed at all!
Fr Frank Thompson MHM
Organizer in the South West
‘Well, Frank, what is your mission appointment going to be’? asked the Superior General just two weeks before my ordination.
If anybody knew he did!
‘Borneo’, I replied with confidence — and to Kenya I was sent!
I found myself second curate in a large mission called Kibuye on the outskirts of Kisumu town.
Dholuo was the language and I knew I was an encumbrance until I could make myself understood.
My parish priest had always dreamed of building outstation churches and, with the luxury of two curates, here was his chance to convert one into a builders' labourer!
I quickly learned the words ‘nyundo kod musmandy’(hammer and nails), though Sunday sermons proved a problem!
Two and a half years and four churches later my Dholuo had improved but my back had suffered from a fall through a ceiling and too much carrying of cement!
The Bishop thought a change would do me good and my next appointment was to Port Victoria where the language was Oluluyha and I could begin again trying to make myself understood!
My speciality shifted from building to wading through the Bunyala swamps with wellies and a rucksack on my back.
I discovered that wellies were good for keeping feet wet when the water came above your waist — and I found alternative footwear!
For another two and a half years I survived the mosquitoes and grew to love the people and was just looking forward to my first home leave when a letter from the Superior General appointed me to Vocations Director in the South of England!
I came home with a heavy heart and wondered how on earth I could foster vocations.
In four years I fostered one! and I am proud to say that Fr Liam Durrant, our present Vocations Director, came through my hands — should he be successful, would that make me a grandfather?!
I enjoyed another two years in Kenya but now my work is mission appeals in South West Britain and I have discovered at last the source of our treasure!
You are the people who make our work possible and I try to forge more tangible links between us.
Through yearly local reunions and retreat weekends in ‘Courtfield’ I have come to know, love and admire so many of you.
And when I appeal in parishes Sunday by Sunday I am aware that I meet the very people who made me a missionary.
‘Lord, teach us to pray’
Fr Michael Hurley MHM
The great Catholic writer and defender of the Faith, G.K. Chesterton, once wrote: ‘If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.’
He meant, of course, that anything beautiful, anything worthwhile, should not just be left to experts — we should all be in there enjoying it, taking part in it.
If exercise is beneficial to health, it must not be left just to Seb Coe or Daley Thompson.
We should all be exercising, even when we do it badly, even when we cut a ridiculous figure as we job along, puffing and panting.
It's the same with other things — learning skills or hobbies.
And it is just the same with PRAYER.
There are few people who are experts in prayer, who do it well.
But, all of us know that we have to make the effort at prayer.
We may do it badly, but the beauty is that we do it at all.
In this First Article I want to make two points.
The first is that no one and no book can teach us to pray.
The only real teacher of Prayer is God Himself.
He can teach us because He knows us through and through — our strengths, our weaknesses, inclinations and dispositions — and He loves us with an all-penetrating love.
He wants us to be with Him, so that He can show us His Love.
He will teach us how to pray.
All we have to do is: Give Him time, and listen to Him.
The second point is: Most of us down the years have tried to pray, and have found a pattern that suits us.
One may say: ‘I pray best when the Rosary Beads are slipping through my fingers.’
Grand!
Stay with it.
Another says: ‘I pray best when I sit before the Blessed Sacrament, or look at the Crucifix without saying anything — just being with the Lord.’
That is a beautiful way of prayer.
Keep at it.
A third says: ‘I love to read a few words of the Gospel, so that I can see Christ and listen to what He is saying to me.’
Isn't that a marvellous way of praying?
Stay there, for God is there with you.
Don't change your pattern of prayer merely because someone mentions the latest method just arrived on view.
Stay with your way of praying, provided it helps and brings you into the presence of God.
There are, indeed, many ways of praying and I will deal with some of them later.
For now, let me just stress:
1)
God is the only true Teacher of Prayer, so ask: ‘Lord, teach me to pray.’
2)
Stay with the method of prayer that helps most and brings you into the Presence of God.
Perhaps I could ask you to read Psalm 5; and St Luke's Gospel, Chapter 11, verses 1 to 4.
Let us pray for each other.
God bless you all.
 Michael Hurley 
Trusting the Laity
Bernard Coleman MHM
In Kenya the Church started as in-service training scheme for teachers of Religious Education called CISRET.
It has proved to be a great grace for the Church.
In 1981 Vitalis Okoth from St Paul's Parish, Mbaga, was invited to go on the course.
Being a dedicated Catholic and chairman of the parish council he was an obvious choice.
Shortly after Vitalis finished his course, a teacher in one of the schools told me that he wanted to get married in Church.
He had had no instruction in the Faith and his wife was not a Catholic.
I saw that they would both need instructions for baptism and marriage.
The difficulty was finding a time to instruct them.
Their school was nine miles from Mbaga and there was no time after school finished in the evening for the teacher and his wife to come and return home before dark.
Saturday was not a suitable day as it is the only day that teachers can go shopping and can see to other family matters.
We were left with Sunday afternoon.
That was not really convenient for me as I often did not know at what time I would return from saying Mass in the outstations.
I was telling Vitalis about the problem when he volunteered to do the job himself.
To tell the truth, I was not over-enthusiastic.
I wondered if he would teach the right things and even if he knew enough himself!
He got down to work at once and even found another couple, both teachers, who wanted to ‘settle up’ in Church.
The following Sunday, when I returned from safari, there was Vitalis sitting under a tree with his little group.
After my lunch, I thought it better to go down and see them and to show my interest.
To my disbelief, Vitalis had started his course by teaching about the Sign of the Cross and the Our Father.
I think he saw my reservations.
He told me that it was necessary for them to start praying at home every day.
It was of no use if they received the sacrament of Matrimony and did not live as Christians.
Daily prayer in the home, he said, was essential.
Since they did not understand what the Sign of the Cross meant or the meaning of Our Father, he had started with a simple explanation of these and had told them how important it was to start praying together.
I remember saying to myself, ‘Clever Clogs!
You would have been talking a lot of deep stuff about Baptism and Matrimony.’
From that moment, I never doubted that God had put the right man, Vitalis, in the right place at the appropriate time.
FATHER PETER'S CORNER
Over the years you get called all kinds of things, but a few weeks ago I reached new heights.
A Cameroonian schoolboy saluted me as his ‘heavenly brother’.
I had not long returned to England after a visit to my old mission of Cameroon on the West coast of Africa.
There I had been present at the celebrations marking the Golden Jubilee of St Joseph's College, Sasse,(pronounced Sassay), where I used to teach.
Sasse, as it is generally known, is the oldest secondary school in the Cameroon Republic by a good ten years.
In its fifty years' existence it has poured out a stream of bishops, priests, doctors, engineers, businessmen, civil servants and politicians.
The Mill Hill priests who started Sasse in 1939 have made a great contribution to the national life of this young African country.
My ‘heavenly brother’ was not a Sasse boy, but from the primary school in nearby Mutengene mission where I had been staying for a few days.
(Mutengene is a harder word than Sasse so I had better give you the pronunciation: Moo-teng-genay.)
Gilbert had served my Mass every morning and was now writing to tell me about the approaching Easter examinations and was hoping to do well.
It struck me that in calling me his heavenly brother he had gone straight to the heart of all our missionary endeavours.
The Church, and that means all of us, including you, not just priests and bishops, has to spread the Good News to all the world.
It has to bring everybody to know God, and to give everybody the chance of the everlasting happiness with God that we call heaven.
We don't all work in the same way to spread the good News.
But we should all be doing something, and the best place to begin is with a prayer every day for God's blessing on the great work of telling people that God loves them.
God bless you all, my heavenly brothers and sisters.
 FATHER PETER.
St Joseph's College, Mill Hill, London, NW7 4JX
MILL HILL NEWSROUND…
MILL HILL NEWSROUND…
SUDAN
Fr Piet Leliveld, newly arrived in war-torn Sudan, writes to say that he is now in Omdurman, near the site of the famous battle of 1898, waiting for a government permit to move to El Obeid.
Thanks to the Red Cross the town had been supplied with food for some months ahead.
‘There are many refugees, and if you see the ones who survived you understand why the others did not.’
Another Mill Hill Priest is working in Omdurman, living very simply in the shanty-town and trying to organize his flock into small Christian communities.
INDIA: HYDERABAD
Prema Seva Sadan is a project run by Fr Theo Raijmakers for the rehabilitation of street-children.
He is forced to interpret this description very literally.
‘Once you start taking people from poor families you might well be tempted to concentrate just on them, and in the end you won't be taking anyone from the streets at all.’
Bad as it is to be poor in Indian it's worse to be as destitute as the street-children.
The first thing to do is to give them food and shelter, medicine, and chance to take a bath, some clothing.
Time enough to think of rehabilitation later on.
‘If someone has been living on the streets for a number of years he can't switch over to an organized life in a couple of days…it is too sudden.
We often find it takes three or four years before a youth is used to a regular life once more.
We keep open house here and they can come and go as they please before settling down, as many do, after a few attempts.
The results are encouraging.
We have our own little school here and a good number go to various schools in town.
Many are training as carpenters or tailors.’
ISRAEL
Brother Huub de Bij has returned from a short stay in Israel where he was responsible for directing and producing a colour-video highlighting the plight of Christian Arabs, ‘a minority within a minority’.
The film was made at the request of a Belgian organization and will be dubbed from English into French and Flemish.
PAKISTAN: PESHAWAR
Christians in Pakistan are 1% of the population, the rest being 97% Muslim and 2% Hindu.
Despite this tiny majority status the Catholics in Peshawar, the seat of Islamic fundamentalism, are in good heart.
Fr Fred Franklin, from Lincoln, describes the attendance at the Good Friday liturgy this year as being something he could never have imagined, with churches crowded to the doors and congregations flooding out to fill the church courtyards.
The long efforts of the years are beginning to show results and Catholics have a new self-confidence.
Another Mill Hill priest, Fr Greg Rice from the States, is local director of the relief-agency Caritas and is battling with the refugee problem.
There are three million refugees from Afghanistan in Pakistan.
Up to now they have been well looked after by the Pakistan government and established in villages of 50,000 to 60,000 people.
The new flood of refugees consequent upon the Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan is straining the relief services.
Another result of the altered circumstances in Afghanistan is the staggering increase in the drug traffic in Peshawar.
Fr Rice has taken over the running of a detoxification centre started some years ago by a Mill Hill priest who died recently.
For sheer lack of space and resources he is having to turn away drug-addicts who are begging for admission.
Letters to the Editor
Ref: your new Magazine title ‘Young Churches’, I have always understood that there was only ONE TRUE HOLY & APOSTOLIC CATHOLIC CHURCH.
 E.J. Roche-Kelly, Esher 
This terminology dates back to St Paul who spoke of the church in Corinth, in Thessalonika, etc.
Vatican II endorsed this terminology as does our present Holy Father.
When addressing the Cardinals in 1984.
Pope John Paul II said, ‘The Church is a communion of churches, and indirectly a communion of nations, languages and cultures.
Each of these brings a gift to the whole.’
The young churches are those which until recently we called ‘the Missions’.
Maybe ‘sister churches’ is a better title?
Ed.
‘Fifty years ago’ leaves me almost speechless.
What is the average APF old dear like me to make of it?
I'm used to similar excerpts in The Telegraph and in the local press, but don't expect them to be so boring.
Good old bishop Shanahan, but the same splendid attitude has been shown since then!
 Laura Payne, Southsea 
Point taken.
Now ‘Fifty Years Ago’ has been relegated to the bottom of this page!
Ed.
I thought the centre double photo page of the celebration of Mass in the simple Third World Church was very beautiful.
I thought the great central arch of two tree trunks looked like our Blessed Lord's arms holding up the whole Church.
 D. Latham, Stoke-on-Trent 
In the Spring issue of the magazine, a correspondent reminisced about the days when she collected for ‘black babies’.
I realize that this was done without any intention of hurting anyone, but maybe it would be good to point out that this term can and does offend.
I know that the ‘black baby’ campaign was merely an attempt at fund-raising, but when one realizes that this implies that black children were ‘for sale’one can see that this term would be deeply offensive to black Catholics and others.
Indeed, I recently heard of a case where some Catholic white children taunted a Catholic black child with the words, ‘Are you one of those who were bought?’
Without seeking to judge the past in any way, and trying to live out our belief that all races of equal dignity, maybe it would be good if such phrases were now quietly forgotten.
 T.L. Burke MHM, APF Organizer, Liverpool 
It was the famous Father William Doyle SJ who invented the ‘black babies’ slogan.
He had cards printed each with a picture of a rescued baby and an invitation to ‘buy’ a black baby orphan for half-a-crown.
Those who donated this amount — a princely sum before the First World War — had the right to select a baptismal name.
The money raised was given to the Holy Childhood and the scheme was adopted by Australia and Scotland.
Father Doyle became the famous Fr Willie Doyle of the trenches, where he was killed in 1917.
Time has indeed changed.
The Holy Childhood — one of the Pontifical Mission Societies — is now renamed Missionary Children with the slogan ‘Children Helping Children’.
It is active in most of the young churches.
Ed.
Up to last year we used to collect used postage stamps and then when our dear friend Father Burbage left for Zambia we had to abandon it because we had no idea where they were sent to.
 Denis Kileen, Hyde 
The SPA collects used postage stamps at Eccleston Square, and last year received £129 for them.
But please post stamps only in large envelopes.
Sending small packages costs the donor more in postage than the stamps are worth!
Ed.
FIFTY YEARS AGO…
Extracts from Missions and Missionaries , Autumn 1939 Fifty years ago the APF was 100 years old.
Africa's hour has struck!
The announcement that no less than three mission-territories are to be entrusted to native African bishops has rejoiced mission-minded Catholics all over the world.
But it is to the peoples of Africa that the news gave the greatest happiness.
The appointment of Mgr.
Kiwanuka as first Vicar-Apostolic of Musaka in Uganda, of Mgr.
Ramarosandratana as Vicar-Apostolic of Miaranarivo, Madagascar, and of Mgr.
Faye as Prefect-Apostolic of Ziguinchor, Senegal, brings Africa into line with India, China and Japan, who have each been able to boast their own bishops for some years.
At the time of going to press the arrangements for the consecration of these first black bishops of modern times are not yet complete, but it is rumoured that the Holy Father has expressed the wish to elevate all three distinguished sons of Africa to the plenitude of the priesthood with his own hands.
Here and There
KOREA
In 1777 a group of Korean scholars sat down to study some Catholic books which had arrived in Korea from Japan.
One of them, Yi Sung-hun, went to China in 1783.
In Peking he contacted missionaries and asked for baptism.
Taking the name Peter he returned home, took the Gospel to his friends and baptized them.
Without a priest they met every Sunday in a house on whose site Seoul Cathedral now stands.
So, Korea is the only country where the Catholic Church was founded not by missionaries, but by the people themselves.
Within seven years persecution broke out.
This lasted on and off, for a hundred years and gave the Korean church over 10,000 martyrs.
103 of these were canonized by Pope John Paul when he visited Korea in 1984 for its 200th Anniversary celebrations.
Now there are over two million Catholics in South Korea.
Last year 60 priests were ordained.
Now the Koreans boast 1,212 local priests and only 222 missionaries.
We have no statistics for the North.
Last year in Seoul diocese alone, more than one hundred thousand converts were received into the Church.
But the Church is facing major problems.
Despite its impressive growth it represents only 5 per cent of the total population and is not growing as fast as evangelical sects.
Parishes are too big.
Seoul Cathedral parish has over 30,000 Catholics.
Only parishes over 60,000 may have a curate.
Laity participate mainly through traditional organizations and the call now is for a new strategy based on small Christian communities.
This year the 44th Eucharistic Congress will be held in Korea from 5th to 8th October.
South Korea is known for its ship building.
But last year it sold seven million bibles translated into 119 languages to 90 countries and so became the world's largest exporter of bibles.
INDIA
Spanish Jesuit missionaries went to Gujarat in 1921.
Since then the Catholic population has risen from 4,000 to 120,000.
More spectacularly the province now numbers 290 Jesuits, 231 of who are Indians.
In recognition of the Salesians' work in education the Prime Minister, Rajiv Ghandi, has authorized a commemorative postage stamp picturing the Salesians' founder, St John Bosco, with an Indian boy.
India now has 55,000 religious sisters (nuns).
Only 2,000 are missionaries.
ZAMBIA
In 1984 the youth of the Diocese of Chipata met to discuss the story of Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24: 13–35) and ask the question, ‘What do we talk about as we walk the path of life?’
At the end of three days their resolutions included a request that the diocese establish a centre where young people can study the Bible, dramatize the gospel passages and find ways of evangelizing the youth of Zambia.
With the help of the APF this centre has now been opened and operates under the motto, ‘Christ is our light.
Together let us shine.’
EAST AFRICA
Due to an upsurge in vocations the Holy Ghost Fathers have now established a new province for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
45 East Africans have been ordained and they have 102 major seminarians.
EAST TIMOR
In only five years the Catholic population of the diocese of Dili has increased from 280,000 to 540,000.
It is the rituals of the Church which particularly attract the local people.
MONASTERIES
Benedictine, Trappist and Cistercian monasteries are flourishing in the Young Churches.
There are 84 in Africa, 111 in Latin America, 80 in Asia, 10 in the Far East.
An average of 3 new monasteries are opened in the Third World every year.
SENEGAL
The first two missionary sisters from Senegal have received their missionary crosses from Cardinal Thiandoum, the Archbishop of Dakar.
As he presented the crosses he advised: ‘Live your religious life to the full.
Make Our Lady known and loved.
The Church in Senegal sends you to the Church in Benin.’
JAMAICA
The Franciscan Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Perpetual Help of Jamaica, commonly called the ‘Blue Sisters’ were founded in Jamaica in 1925.
Three Blue Sisters have now been sent as Missionaries to work in North West Atlanta, USA.
ITALY
In March parents and relatives of Italy's 17,000 missionaries made a pilgrimage to Rome.
In his address to them the Holy Father stressed that the era of Missionaries has not ended.
He appealed to Christian families to foster vocations to meet the growing challenge of those who do not know Christ.
MISSIONARIES
Although they suffer from a shortage of personnel themselves it is the young churches who are now providing the Church with missionaries.
Japan has 273 missionaries (30 priests, 239 sisters and 4 lay people).
Mauritius has 78 missionaries in 26 countries.
Chile has sent 96 missionaries (15 priests, 74 sisters, 3 brothers and 2 lay volunteers).
GROWING CHALLENGE
In 1986 (the latest year for which statistics are available) the world population grew by over 81 million (81,557,000) and the number of Catholics by over 12 million (12,426,000) to 864 million (864,379,000).
But the percentage of Catholics world-wide dropped from 17.68% to 17.64%.

The joy of Fr Toror and his mother
Father Toror was lucky.
In 1983 about 500 candidates for the priesthood had to be turned away in Asia and Africa as there was no room for them in the seminaries and no money left.

Started by Pauline Jaricot at the age of 17 Now involves the whole Church in helping the world
•The A.P.F.
was founded by a French girl, Pauline Jaricot, over 150 years ago, and, in 1922, was made by Pope Pius XI the official mission aid society of the whole Church.
The English Branch, in 1936, was linked at parish level, for practical purposes, to St. Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions, the Mill Hill Fathers.
•The unique characteristic of the A.P.F.
is that it helps all the 910 missionary dioceses of the world through a central fund, to which all countries, including the missionary countries themselves, contribute.
The funds are distributed fairly to all missions twice a year.
None is neglected and none unduly favoured.
The National Directors of each country attend the meetings at which the distributions are made, and discuss them in some detail.
•The subsidies given to the missions are of two kinds:
Ordinary subsidies: every missionary bishop gets, without fail each year, an ordinary subsidy of up to twenty thousand pounds for the ordinary day-to-day running of the diocese.
He can rely on this and plan accordingly.
Extraordinary subsidies: these are grants towards particular projects for which the bishop asks for help.
These projects range over the entire field of the life of the Church: the establishment of new dioceses; the training of catechists, lay leaders, nuns, priests; the building of churches, parochial centres, school centres; preaching the Gospel by press, television and radio; hospitals, clinics, leprosaria, disaster relief, medicines, transport and other miscellaneous works.
An average of nearly 2½ thousand such projects a year are helped by the central fund.
Each year, the whole of the money coming in from the world A.P.F.
goes out to the missions.
•This is a most unselfish and therefore most Christ-like way of giving.
If we give to personally known recipients, we experience gratification while they experience obligation.
By giving through a central fund to which all give according to their means and from which those in need receive, we fulfil our Lord's precept: Do not let your right hand know what your left is doing.
At the same time, we can be certain, because a full account is published, that our gifts go to the missions where they are most needed, are received with gratitude and reciprocated with prayers.
•Prayer: The A.P.F.
is not simply a money-centred enterprise.
Every member is asked to PRAY DAILY for the world mission of the Church.
This concentration of the mind and the heart in prayer adds enormously to the value of the material gift and is a source of spiritual enrichment to the giver.
•Understanding: Every member is encouraged to UNDERSTAND the meaning of the mission today through reading the magazine,Missions and Missionaries , given free to all members, so that there will be a growing realisation that the Church is Catholic because it is missionary, and that without the missions the Church would not be itself.
Through the A.P.F., with its central fund, its National Directors in every country, and its international co-operation, the universal character of the Catholic Faith is brought home to us, and great hope for the future of the Church in the world is given to us, as we see the vigour and variety of its progress in the mission lands.
Play your part in this great enterprise.
Join with the Pope in the A.P.F.
and help to bring the world to Christ.
