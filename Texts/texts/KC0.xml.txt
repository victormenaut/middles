That's  gravy  carrots and peas.
You've had a problem with damp Mollie  Noel tells me?
Well  it isn't erm  specifically in the erm  cupboards it's just erm  because I'm now  coping with   who  has acted like a erm  shoemaker  shoemaker's son do all your job  I am coping with what he did thirty odd years ago
Oh!
and it's  all gone bad!
I mean the erm  I still had to have completely new guttering in the summer because you cannot get anything to  mend the other walls because it's the wrong side!
And  the only bit of damp I've got is in one corner of the house but it came from a blocked  erm  pipe.
Oh I see!
A blocked pipe.
Oh that's awful!
No, no not a blocked one but I mean  let's face it  
It's alright now, carry on being all er  carry on now and

Yes.
And then you have a join

Yes.
Well on that join  I suddenly saw water rushing down the wall!
You see  that's a  that's a comparable thing to what happened in ours  and that was  
 
 
Erm, I'll do I'll do that cos, go on.
Erm,
 
assistant at any rate  made water tip straight o out of the  and down the wall  you could never  
Into the , into the cabinet  and the old wooden structure!

I had to clear it all off though the  the original, what they sort of call, what the dog there 
 
Oh really,!
Well they had to come out to 
I think that maybe you should have done much more  actually, but I I haven't  argued because he's so .
It's no good him taking the bridge down  out now, because he can't put the wall  can't really re-brick there now  much too wet!
That's right.
Oh yes!
Can you manage love?
Yes, thank you dear.
So that I'm suffering.
The major thing I find so 
But I , my personal suffering was erm  in the summer, frightfully!
And you see, you know the ball over the  gutters
Yes.

What, with the wine?
Yes.
Mm.
I know, I I was given   
That's right!
because  it was well written up in the Wine Society  I would descr describe it as nice, nice but innocuous.

Oh is it really?
But I don't know what.
Ha.

Well maybe white wines are  er   spritzy aren't they?
Oh yes, and this isn't

That's right.
Now really but erm  this year's been so peculiar that

Terribly frightening!
Mm, mm.
It just would be so awful to move our lovely trees  cos they're all so, so dependent, that's it!
That's the  the trees.
That's all I worry about.
Yes!
It's no good worrying about it, I do know that!
Mhm.
It is 
But 
worrying though.
Well  no, I've met pe also Lady 
Mm mm.
and she said David said he saw a few snow flakes.
Well I said if I see three snow flakes we're off to Tenerife!
Well we have, we have.
Mm.
Very slight snow shower about two days ago didn't we?

And it bounced and bounced and bounced and I thought it was going on for ages but it didn't.
No.
Oh!
Soon disappeared.
Mm.
Have you got any fish left in your pond Mollie?
No.
Haven't you?
Heron took the lot!
Oh no!
Oh God!

Oh yes!
And James said, there's a heron slaughtering one of your big goldfish!
Aagh!
You see.
Yeah.
Oh and we all rushed out and said, shoo!
And it flew o , flew away.
Mm.
And then  Ted and I went out a little bit later and we sa , we found two goldfish  and two golden  
They damage them don't they?
Oh,!
so they haven't got a  or they 
No, they bite so, oh do they?
No they , they swallow them.
Yeah.
I mean they swallow them quite nicely.
And sometimes they just 
And I said well that's !
next time.
And the next day I went off and there wasn't even a snail 
No.
in the pond.
No.
Nothing at all!
No.
Oh God!
Cos I think I've 
That's terrible!
got a carp too.
Oh yeah!
Terrible!
If perhaps you were to spread erm  a wire netting over the pond Mollie?
Well yes I know, but I'm not having that!
But erm  what I am going to do but I can't do it until  the spring  erm  at least until  erm   has cut the grass for the first time
Mm.
erm, out there.
Then I'm going to do what is the proper thing to do which is chop that to size 
With the same as that , yes!
Yes,
Oh yes that 
that and  farm and 
Yes.
this black 
so many creatures 
black stuff
Yep!
so they could be thrown over  Oh  this behaviour, no, they're so inflexible with their programme!
Three feet from the wall from your  
you see, and they get their 
I see!
feet tangled
Yeah.
but I can't, it's no good doing it now because you see erm  dogs can get in at present and 
Yes.
and rushing about and 
You needn't do anything horrid to them, terrible!
I mean,you can just er 
Oh no!
a wire cage  
they, no just go away.
I mean I've seen it 
them.
they don't like it.
No.
They're incapable
No.
That's right.
because of the erm  it's not wire, it's 
No.
just a a thread, you 
Oh!
see?
And they get a bit 
Mm.
Mm mm.
My father always used to do that for his crocuses because the birds  loved the yellow ones, don't they?
Mm.
Mm.
And his daffs, he was going to use his, lose his yellow crocuses of the year  so he spread black cotton 
Oh yes mm.
Mm.
and they jolly well learned 
Yes, I know, simple.
that that's what
Oh yeah.
that it 
Mollie.
was there!
Mm.
So we had to get used to the  ending up in 
Mm.
black cotton against the sparrows I used to get really fed up with it!
 
Poor little things!
And I thought I'd got
I understand now what it was.
knowing  erm  why all the purple cro crocuses  good cook  and I thought I've got no   
And at nights I used to feel like 
and I had got
cos they've come now haven't they?
Ah yes, that's 
And I 
right  
I told you!
All  I've got all morning,
Mm.
and I've got clumps of  of snowdrops  where I'd  and some where I didn't know even know I had snowdrops and 
Mm.
now I have found those lovely little erm  wild  purple crocuses
Mm.
I couldn't 
Good!
think what their  was?
Right in the middle of a plot needless 
Mhm.
and they're all coming out!
And they're round 
Good!
my !
Good!
And so I, I've found that there 
 
but I've, but I've lost my baytree.
Mm.
How much 
But that's moles.
Mm.
Oh moles!
Oh dear!
Well they got down in the grass you see.
There's quite a lot of them again this 
Mm.
year.
They got them, mm?
They have a lot again this year, moles.
Will we?
Mm.
Well I've got millions!
Well I 
Have we?
I must ring erm  r Eddy  and ask him if you get them ?
I don't know whether you can get them wi weather like this.
Oh!
Why do you say there are more Noel?
 
Well I don't know why we've got more, but we've got a lot.
Oh I'm sorry!
I thought you were prophesying.
We've got some have we?
Mm!
Well I didn't know.
 
Oh!
Even in the back now.
That is the .
Mm.
They come from  a bank and a ditch  always.
Well you've certainly got them.
Well I've never get it before now  right?
Now  who is Eddy ?
Well Mrs  's son.
Oh!
And erm, when I said to them  because he's sharp so she says.
My .
Well he's wonderful!
And the wo mind you, he's much too heavy for me but  of course, well my father was  and they're arm things but I must get some fresh.
And, I said  well I don't know what I'm going to do without Jack  because he was so wonderful with my moles last year  he said  you haven't had me yet!
 
Oh!
No erm, so I thought well
Brilliant.
if he thinks he's as good as that then have him.
Trouble is, if you remove moles  you just leave an evolutionary niche for them and they're  another lot move into the field, you can never get rid of them because if you  remove your own private moles another 
Mm.
lot come in, you see.
Mm.
Oh how lovely!
But do you mean  that they wouldn't try and 
Oh they're really lovely!
visit if you had your own moles?
Well no, but they won't over-densify, they wo won't make the population too dense, you see.
I see.
And th , you know,the they might spoil 
Might be 
things.
mine come in 
Yes, I'm sure they will.
and they go over the fields.
Yeah.
Yeah!
And there are hundreds of the wretched 
Mm.
.
Mm.
I consider four moles are too dense.
Mm.
Yes.
One mole is too dense for me!
Mm.
Cos they always get under your favourite plant!
Mm.
Fay, can I pass you some more vegetables up?
No, I'm doing fine thank you darling.
But please encourage other people to have some.
Well I'm sorry
I've been trying to.
I have  here.
Ha have some more veg.
No,eat this one.
And a little bit more.
No it 
I'm fine thank you Noel.
I hope you're never looking at me but I have to  dinner.
Why not!
I put my life down to fish and  
Mollie , you know that my  I dislocated my jaw in November  mm.
Mm?
How?
Just eating a sandwich!
How could you?
Cheese sandwich.
I don't know!
Mm.
And it clicked  and I, well occasionally before  and very occasionally and I 
Might have  
I just   the slightest sort of movement has readjusted it  and this would not move  at all!
And erm  I'm shovelling food now because it's so difficult!
I still can't get it any wider .
 
Really?
Mm.
Nope.
Mm.
Drop more wine Mollie?
No thank you, I'm alright.
.
By the way those  did I tell you they  put me on some tablets to re to erm  to erm
No.

Really?
Yes,.
Well there must be something in it because I feel so relaxed these days I can't get 
oh really!
Well that's nice!
Don't flap about anything!
Well er
 
No quarrels.
Erm, somebody tells me that Sarah is erm  doing very well but has had a foul cold ever since she's been over there, is she very well now?
Yes, she went with a  yes she has.
Mm.
I phoned her on the fourth night to say goodnight to her that was all.
spoken to her in the meantime
Mhm.
and she was actually, at nine o'clock
Well she don't 
erm well in bed.
Mm.
lives at  Foreham which is just the other side of .
Mhm.
She was very bad at start with the new people but then I'll take her up 
 
Mm.
She can't make a commitment.
But she can be very , she can be very secluded there.
Mm.
Mm.
She can be just .
I reckon she wants to 
Oh it's a lovely little lane I've  I've always loved that lane.
I know you think I'm
Have you ?
Have you?
Yes.
And  lives on there.
 
Well I've known Derek  since I was  six weeks old.
I was taken there for the first time  when I was six weeks old  in a motor side car  down from London  to  just within ten miles of Bury St Edmunds.
Why I didn't die I don't know!
We well, a motor side car!
Yes, absolutely!
I'm astonished  
erm because my grandmother wanted to see her first grandchild before she died.
Oh yeah.
And she died about two months later.
At six weeks,
You see I  Connie.
Really?
and Connie, Connie's six weeks younger than I  and  grandma never saw her.
Oh well she did 
but she had a grandson  before that, she had a grandson who was born in eighteen ninety three  and his name was on .
I don't even 
Oh really?
think that in those days anybody would have considered taking a child out like that, you know!
They do it now!
That's right.
It drives me 
In a car 
me up the wall!
Erm  the things they will do for these new little things.
I never used to feel 
I know.
that mine were really here until they .
Did it have a lasting effect on you Mollie?
Well, you can be the judge of that!
No,got it I think, yes!
But then  
You don't like motorbikes and side cars do you Mollie?
It's amazing really!
No.
Well I used to ride a motorbike a and  my father had a Triumph motorbike because he bought  I don't why he, why he bought it  and he was terrified of it cos it was very fierce!
And  my brothers used to ride it, so I used to ride it  and I rode it for miles!
Did you?
Then I rode it in a  in an old  Burberry and I don't how I started it, I think it was kick start.
Mm, yes.
Oh it must have been.
And then we were at Frinton, masses of us, and we always used to go to Frinton in the summer  because one of my uncles had a house there  and we knew the people who erm  dad used to play golf and mother used to knit  on the beach, you know.
 
Oh yes.
Mm mm.
And we used to  th masses of cousins there  and erm  one  one of my  Jean, my cousin  about ten months younger than I  said, can I have a go Mollie?
And I said, yes  you see, gave her a try  and so she went  if you know Frinton you could go, in those days 
Yes I know it.
you could go round, well it's the same now, but in those days you could go round, past the summer theatre and down Old Road where we were staying and on to a  and do a circle you see?
Mm.
And we started her off and she went round  and as she went past the second time she said I can't stop!
Oh! oh! oh!
Oh no!
And then she went round again and we said  well push so and so
 
Oh my!
How awful!
And nobody had told her how to stop you know.
I can remember not being able to get off my sister's much bigger push bike, just an ordinary push bike
Oh yes!
and I  pedalled frantically round, didn't know how to get off again cos it was much too high.
And I remember just sort of leaping onto some grass and just letting it go, you know, could of been .
Oh I remember them emphatically 
Oh yes!
now,.
Yes,
I know, I probably learn you see because I borrowed  
 
when I was about twelve  and I remember bashing into a nanny with a pram.
Oh, she was furious 
Oh dear!
with me!
I bet she was.
I bet she was.
cos of nowadays, well they didn't then because she was beastly to me now!
Oh !
Now this is where the meal gets a little bit French because  I have sauce to deal with.
So you are left with erm conversation 
 
I'm going to top your glass up with a
No thank you darling.
No.
I had an experience with a bike when I was very small  a girl up the road  was given a bike  and I had quite quietly learnt how to ride a bike more or less.
Mhm.
And I, I said can I have a ride?
And she said yes.
And I went up and down the road and  miles away then came back  and I couldn't stop because this bike was very old fashioned and you had to stop it by pedalling back 
I know.
pedalling backwards!
Oh yes 
I know.
I've heard of them!
And I I 
I remember those.
Well!
pedalling backwards
Mm.
and I said there are no 
No.
brakes!
There are brakes!
No.
Oh dear!
Anyhow I steered it straight up somebody's drive into their garden.
Oh yes, up a hill or something.
!
No.
How awful!
I've never ridden one but I've heard of it, with this back
Yes, I've heard of it.
Oh yes, that's right.
Yeah.
Be quite good, although you maybe do it by accident sometime and be rather jerky!
That's what I thought earlier.
That's very sudden you 
Oh!
see.
Mm.
Back pedalling, mustn't you?
Hey?
Yo , you might stop sort of suddenly.
Stop very suddenly.
And then you'd  
Yes,yo well I I I yeah, no I have actually got 
No.
th ridden one.
No, I never have 
But 
certainly but I have of that.
Well no not 
But I can remember riding this girl's 
Mm.
bike  can't stop!
Can't stop!
!
And so  er er can 
Mm.
remember riding up
Mm.
up this slope into a
Yes.
onto grass or something.
How are your erm, I heard about erm, I've erm heard Sebastian lately but how is little Romley getting on, is he alright?
Oh he's fine, yes!
The 
Mm.
they make too much fuss of him and they bring him back 
Yes.
too often but
Mm.
Yes.
Good!
And John has got an order to build a new  Orkingford Chapel.
Oh at 
Which would 
John's!
At John's.
Oh how lovely!
Oh have they, good!
Yes.
Mm.
And that's the second one 
Oh that's lovely!
since the war.
Mm?
They had
 
Is it?
Is it really?
they had new one  after the war.
Why do they want another one?
It's  just isn't satisfactory.
How extraordinary.
No.
John's gotta  build a new one.
Oh!
He's not complaining?
No.
No.
And at your old  stamping ground.
Gotta 
For what?
to build one for Chelmsford Cathedral.
Mhm.
Really?
I'm off Chelmsford 
Chelmsford?
Cathedral!
It's ghastly!
I gather it is.
And so is the bloody Bishop there!
Yeah but he's
Absolutely awful!
very nice.
And  erm  if you wanted to hear about Chelmsford Cathedral when Estelle  who was a  humorous and eighty something but  still on the ball  she'll tell you about  the 
Who?
Chelmsford Cathedral.
Estelle .
Who is that?
sister.
Oh  sister!
Oh yes 
And 
I've met her, I've met her!
and erm  ooh she's marvellous!
Yes.
She's be ,ei , eighty six and she lives alone  and she's  she's absolutely  ge again, the Arch Deacon, it's the Arch Deacon there that's the trouble!
He got a bulldozer to bull , to bulldoze up the erm  aisles  and bulldoze the sanctuary  and he's thrown away, God knows what!
I mean there are, there, there were erm  all sorts of things there.
And his, and he got rid of the beautiful eagle  erm  you know, reading desk  and he got rid of the  Bishops's  erm, chair, the Bishop's  what do they call it?
Oh yes.
Throne?
The Bishop's throne!
And he's put all wrought iron one there!
Yeah.
Well I 
Absolutely furious!
Sh she won't 
I haven't been in 
go near it!
Do you know what she does?
On  is the erm  erm, nearly next door is the old erm  Quaker Chapel
Oh yes.
the most beautiful building and  nobody can pull it down, but  
Not the chapel Mollie?
No,
Not .
Meeting House.
Meeting House 
Meeting House 
yes.
And opposite her  is where the erm  Quakers meet now because they can't afford to run the chapel  the erm  Meeting 
Meeting House.
Meeting House  as  a big one and they are  getting fewer.
But she says  I sometimes just walk across the road and go to the Meeting House at  you know 
Well I've got a theory 
rather than the cathedral.
Yeah.
I've got a theory  I have a feeling there's going to be a great  revival  of people with a Quakered mind  way of thinking.
Yes 
I I 
Yes.
do agree.
But the trouble is Noel, in the meantime  erm  the Quakers have fallen apart  because the Quakers have filled themselves up with  sort of barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads 
Well I know they have, yes I agree.
with the and haven't, but haven't ever read 
That's right.
the bible  
 
sort of Eastern religion type, meditation and thing and it's no good at all!
The old fashioned Quakers who were sikhs and everything.
Mm.
Now, what I have learnt at college this week which is  rather interesting I think.
Well I think you'll be interested.
Erm  in the bible  in the new part, the new testament, there's a  er an epistle of James.
Yes.
Mm.
Well  I am told that that is the earliest thing at all.
I'd say that.
That is his erm  actually a brother of Jesus in his family 
Yes.
and so it's very much as he was thinking  and it should be in the old testament really cos it was written  you know, before Jesus
Mm.
That's right.
before the, before the crucifixion.
Erm, and it's been quickly Christianized with just two little lectures at the beginning of two chapters to Christianize so it was popped in for new testament  and it's the nearest we can get to  to teaching.
And of course, it's totally Jewish
Mm.
but I'd say it's th it's th Je , the Jewish teaching as Christ would have preached it 
Mm.
you see and it's for  all the family.
And there's, towards the end of the  first chapter  there's a bit all about erm  erm  er temptation and deliver us from evil kind of thing which is obviously rather from the, from the Lord's Prayer and yet it's, rather explained rather nicely and it, it's a lovely, lovely book!
It's only five  
 
Do you know, I haven't ever read it.
I will do of course.
I've heard about that.
It's lovely!
It really is lovely!
And you really feel that 
 
here is a 
I shan't be able to walk home!
Really?
It seems to be 
Mm.
everything  sort of, in a nutshell, you don't need any of the rest 
Oh well!
of the new 
Mm.
testament, that's just quite enough, it's just a  just th the Jewish thing filled out slightly and and and a little bit less rules and, you know,i it's very, very lovely!
Well apparently Chelms 
I've never read it , but I shall.
We'll have a go, yes.
Well that's what Chelmsford's got you see, Chelmsford was was full of Quaker!
I mean, I can, I can  erm  quote the Quaker the families who still live there.
Yes.
Oh, all the important people were Quaker families when I lived there  you see?
And the erm  the .
The , I was gonna say them.
Oh the  were appalling!
Ah yeah, the  , the  and  I knew them.
Oh yes!
Yes.
and erm
What about the ?
They're still there apparently 
The  were
Oh yes, they're still there!
and the  were the Norfolk more weren't they?
Mm mm?
Were the  Norfolk more, were they?
I think they were.
Yes, I I mean I can't remember  they  and the  and .
By the time  
I can't remember now but they're at least five.
I was thinking of them the other night, well they  er, five at least erm      they were 
 
th they were Quakers.
But er
,,and something else, I can't remember them.
I di , I always think of the , I met one or two of those.
They're  
A when I go through
Oh Mrs ,
off the train and  still standing there with her name on her side.
 
Mm.
Yeah, that's right.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh they're lovely people!
But er
They ran everything.
I'd been per wo ah  I I feel that  all this  doctrine  res religions are spoilt 
That's what I said!
by doctrine.
Exactly!
Oh no!
Nobody believes 
That's wrong!
any of it now!
I mean I think 
No I know.
  
I know.
Yeah, it's terribly sad!
It's terribly sad!
I think it's .
Even the Bishop of Durham, I've just recently bought one of his books  and I rather wish I hadn't, I'm not liking it much  erm  he's still much too orthodox really.
Is he?
You know he's still hanging on to 
Oh he is ?
and trying to 
Mm.
show 
Well I mean you can't  you 
Mm.
you can't get fish  from  prize thinking fish 
No.
can you?
No.
But I know they blamed him for that.
And he says you can because he says it's important for it to be a living thing that's got to change with the time.
Mm.
In all that way he's quite correct 
Mm.
I think.
It's just that he hasn't, to me, changed enough, he's still stuck up with all these  various things.
That really
Well I know  let's face it, if he, if he was  really convinced of the  falsity of most it he 
Mm.
couldn't be a conscience to obtain his seat could he?
Well he reckons you can say it in a different way.
You can say 
Mm.
it entirely symbolically and spiritually and and 
Mm.
things don't 
Mm.
have to have happened in fact.
And that the stories were told to make a point and 
Mm.
the trouble is, people have lost the point and kept the story!
Erm, you know, it's saying that
Well, the earliest man who  used to think like this was Albert .
Yes, oh yes course it 
Yeah.
was!
He wrote that marvellous book!
Oh 
Well 
a lovely book!
I've got about six of his books in there!
Well I had all of his books.
famous 
No, er, you mean erm 
I know quite a few .
The er
Christ, the Historic Jesus.
Yes.
With that famous last 
That is his best book 
chapter which is so lovely when 
Yeah.
he sort of says well you still can  spiritually meet Jesus even though you know, it's a rather lovely 
 
the last chapter!
I say, he moves him the more you  search for him historically 
Yeah.
but there is a  there's something hanging about still.
But in a funny way, perhaps there is.
I don't know.
I'm very  very, very, very, tied up with it, I I I invariably turn  relatively happy with it all.
I don't think one has to worry too much.
Been brought up so much, bought up a Christian 
Yes,
you just find it difficult to  to admit that one's rather  you know  But certainly that epistle of James, to me, was just marvellous!
Just everything!
I, I can't 
Mm.
ever remember reading James, If I had, I've forgotten about it.
Mm.
But I shall read him tonight.
Well certainly, you'll enjoy it.
Oh  
Did you go to 
's er  ?
Yes.
Er  I chose the reading.
Oh did you?
Oh 
Yes.
how lovely!
Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.
Yep.
It 
Erm 
was very nicely done!
Louis was very upset cos she forgot to erm  have anyone to take the names  erm 
Well 
so I wrote down 
 
as many as I could  think of
Mm.
and erm  and I asked Margaret , they had a better view where she was
Mm.
and she told a lot of other people and so I think we got a pretty comprehensive list actually.
Oh, we couldn't er  we 
No.
we couldn't go anyhow.
No.
It was very packed in there  but I couldn't see a lot of anything.
But I was glad we couldn't because they asked me to read the lesson.
No it  it's miserable!
Oh yeah.
It spoils everything doesn't it?
I'm glad to say 
Mm.
and stuck to it.
I think there were some people there who didn't really know, but they maybe went because they'd got to a funeral.
Well it wasn't erm
Oh  
it wasn't quite full enough.
I think that's awful don't you?
I I do, I do Mollie!
But, we're doing the right thing for 
I 
the wrong reason.
No this was probably, a relatively 
That's 
original idea.
that's the, that's the wrong thing to do!
Straightforward from there.
Just having a cremation
cos you're talked into doing something .
I was, it's not a very 
And it's not very popular now.
after.
I must say, David worshipped rather well.
 
but steered round it, saying how he admired them 
You said it.
you're obviously going to make his daily 
 
up and down the village and and er 
I said one or two things  
You know, things you could say  
That's quite 
Erm 
true.
and he did decide that I would like a cup of tea  
I wanted to say
he had a great dedication.
and she said that if you couldn't go, or telling him.
And he was the only man in the British Legion who'd ever bought  
That's right darling.

I I can manage  see me any time you want.
No, I did come .
He didn't like.
David  
He didn't.
me and I usually always tell him off.
and I've met people there who I know I knew.
 
Yes, that's true.
And I  
That's true.
Absolutely!
Oh sorry!
But I thought it wasn't  
No, no, no, that's right.
No, when people are dead you must
See you bury them.
Now Mollie that's, I haven't given you a large helping but it's a ginger pudding.
I've been dying to make a good ginger pudding for years!
I like ginger pudding.
So wait and see if it's any good, I don't know.
 
There now Mollie, there's some cream.
Erm, sorry, some custard.
Sauce!
No I'll I 
Sauce.
Oh sauce.
Erm, is a, is is sauce essential?
I should think on this.
It it 
Okay.

Oh well 
of your attention.
I have, if you 
Oh!
don't mind  but I don't like
Heavens!
Come on have some !
I don't like normal cream on everything.
And it's only small helpings  because you can come for more, okay?
Normally I'm staged up on

You see, I love the jacket but I can't cope  because I can't cut it properly.

Yes.
The birds do you see.

And erm  on a job  er on on an English railway starting with  starting a factory out there  and they are  going to manage it  she's worried stiff you see because she says  now  er, Germany and Holland are starting to move in the recession and  once they're there  if the recession comes they'll tack up  her husband immediately

Jolly good!
And help yourself to the, I'm sad to say that that has curdled since I put it in the jug, do you want me to change it?
 
Do you ever cheat and put a little of cornflour  
It's not gonna fit in though.
Oh it has though, that usually stops 
Mm.

And I thought I'd caught it.
Yes.
And I had caught it, it was all over

Do you want some more?

Pardon?
Do you want some more?
But I usually take mine 
No thanks, that was nice 
with ginger rather than the ginger and 
And it's not 
What do you use then?
The fresh ginger.
No, no, the dry ginger!
Oh the dry ginger 
This is my 
ugh!
dry ginger.
Like rocks isn't it?
Mm.
What?
How can you do that?
It's li , it's like rocks isn't it?
Well you  well you halve 
Well 
it you see and  I mean 
And you put it on that
I mean I was thinking of making gingerbread
Mm!
you grate the ginger
Mm!
and as much there  
That's the  , you grate it very fine 
used to it , yeah.
Yes but, you see when I try to buy some  I think the frozen fish is, shop in Woodbridge is silly, damn silly place anyway!
And erm  they offered me a green ginger you see
Mm!
Mm.
Well now, what could you 
Which isn't what you wanted.
do with green ginger?
You put it into casseroles and things or into the fruit 
Is it for Chinese food  
 
Yes I know but do you eat it or do you just put it in to flavour it?
I think mostly flavour it, I I  I suppose you can eat it but 
Well it's a waste of money!
And you put it in Chinese food!
 
But you can eat it.
Oh yes, but you put cloves in and you don't eat them, but they flavour it.
to do a ginger, I I've eaten ginger  of that kind
Oh you eat it.
beat it i in  Chinese dishes.
Because I got some by mistake cos it, yes I know it in Chinese dishes but I don't quite know what they do with it.
Mm.
It is  good piece I hope ?
Well they were, they were qui , they were as big as that.
Mm.
I chucked it out in the end.
If I went to put it in, I was gonna say and I went to put it in er  cos it dries off doesn't it?
Mm.
If I were to put it in er  stewed apples or something I wouldn't eat the actual ginger  but in a casserole, it's nice.
No, but there's no point in putting it in  in  erm  apples because you  grate your dried  
Mm.
with them you see.
Mm.
In there.
Or you can put erm  ginger 
I don't 
in a syrup
Yes.
you can do that.
Yes.
Yeah I like that.
I've got a lot of, quite of lot of dry ginger, dried ginger.
Erm  a little bit more  just a touch more Mollie?
Not for me, no thank you.
None?
I can remember the first time I ever 
 
came across dry ginger  one of my school girlfriends was giving me a recipe, which, for which  one er fo for erm  ginger beer
Mm.
for Christmas, and it was delicious the way her mother made it so  she started it with me writing it down, see, and she told me the ingredients and then she said  you brews the ginger  I thought 
 
brews the ginger?
Fancy her saying it!
She was my grammar school friend, you see.
Mm.
You brews the ginger, so I thought well I'm blessed!
And of course it was ages before I knew she meant bruise.
Mm.
Once I started to make it I realized,o what it was.
, yes.
B R U I S E.
Yeah.
Mm.
But it sounded very 
Mm.

It is the bitterest morning  that I've 
Oh it is bitter!
Thanks, it's lovely!
It is bitter.
Oh that's a beauty!
Isn't it?
 
And what is the fi , is the kitchen erm  chimney needing to be swept or something then?
Er, no the dining room.
Er, I mean the dining room, sorry!
Yes , yes, oh yes I've  well you know the fires on that I had in all the winter I'm going to get on that today.
I know it wants er, sweeping.
Yes.
Yes.
It's smoking.
Yes.
I da , I I I tried to  but I'd smoke the place out!
Aha.
Oh that's a pity because that's the room that you 
Aye 
use a lot isn't it?
Oh yes!
Aha.
But because this in the centre is the warmest room cos there only one door here you see.
Yes.
That's true.
There's five in that other.
Yes  it's lovely!
My goodness it's erm  we were all saying yesterday it was summer!
Noel cut the grass yesterday can you believe it?
And I did 
He did?
Yes.
And I weeded the front garden, some of it.
Erm  and now look at it today!
It's really cold!
Ye , yesterday afternoon, as a matter of fact, I walked up to the gate  and I come back and I just walked across the lawn and I   I felt the sun.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes , felt the sun.
But after one that turned cold again don't it?
It does!
It does!
Oh it's !
Yes.
And er, it was funny yesterday morning the birds in the village were singing  just in the way they do in the spri , in the spring, you know, first light.
Yeah, that's right.
And I thought gosh, if they don't know what's 
Well they've got another month 
 
before spring in.
That's true.
Well that's true!
Yes.
But you see you take it for granted.
Tell me Stanley  erm, I brought your medicine from the doctor
Yes.
er, was that because you've not been well this week or just is it a ,ro routine replacement or something?
Well no, that's erm er, water .
Yes, but I, it's not because you've not been well?
No!
No, no, no, no 
Oh that's fine.
no, no, no, no i , no it's a  i i it's old trouble.
Yes I know.
I know.
It's old trouble.
I think 
I know.
he's more interested in women than anything else!
Oh!
It's sad isn't it?
It really is, it's sad!
I don't know, he come, he said to me  er we we well he come over, you see when I come home from hospital he sa , he had to report  to come and see me  he was a long while before he did come!
But er, he he hopped on one day and er  had a talk with him and so on and  took my temperature and pulse and that, this, that and other, he said well  I'll call again he said, when I'm by, but he never did!
Mm.
He never called!
Mm.
I don't think he 
I had to ring!
Yes.
And I said to him, I said well I hope I don't mind er me ringing the doctor, well he said no that's what we're here for.
But he said, I've got three hours of paperwork!
Well that's nothing to do with it!
Absolutely!
Absolutely!
Nothing to do with it!
I mean, it doesn't stop him from going shooting and fishing does it?
Oh no!
No, no, that's the thing.
I think he's a little bit envious because  er, I took those meadows back, you see.
Possibly , yes.
Cos he used to go shooting there and  and they went in there and they shouldn't of done because Michael told them I'd taken meadows back  and he sa , he said when Tony  told them, they, they'd been there shooting he said well they're, they're out of bounds!
Mm.
Mm.
He said I told them  that.
Mm.
Mm.
But they took advantage, the boys did and they don't care at all!
Ye , yes that's right, mm.
They take liberties .
Yes, they do , they do, it's a shame!
I think  that  a little bit apprehensive on things like that, and course when he saw Tony   asked whether ga , whether he could go and Tony said no, I'm sorry Doc but that he said I've got my ponies and things there and I don't want people shooting there!
Of course not!
No.
There's them foals from , round the back, they don't want them.
Yes.
Aha.
I'm sorry to keep on.
But I'm sure you go down there yourself.
Yes.
Yes, that's 
Oh yes!
true
But they,th th th they just walk on, they don't have to pay anything 
No.
!
No!
No !
Walk over you!
Well they just think they're in a privileged position Stanley!
Yes!
And the only privilege they have is of looking after us isn't it?
Yeah, that's right!
Yes, that's right!
Really!
Yes!
And getting well 
And what you 
paid for it!
what you've got, they're entitled to!
Absolutely!
That's right !
That's nice of them!
Yes, absolutely !
Well that's right innit?
Yes.
Oh dear oh dear!
Oh heck!
Well, so  there you are and I told them, he he said that he wanted erm  a urine sample you see and so of course when the nurse come after he'd gone, later  and I kept waiting and I thought to myself well I want to know the result!
Yes.
Jackie said, well ring them,sh he should know something about it!
Yes.
And that don't take a week, week to test anything like that!
It shouldn't do, no.
When it's gone to hospital.
And, I rang, I better ask him you see, and of course, who was the lady in the office?
Oh she's called Jean.
She's very nice!
Who is it?
Jean, her name.
Jean?
I don't know her other name.
She is a very nice person.
A very nice person.
Yes.
She is.
Polite and such like.
That's right.
Yes!
That's right.
Yes, I I think to, well what a nice person you are to, to talk to!
Yes.
Nice personality I shouldn't 
Very nice!
reckon.
And I got that, well  and she sa ,she said  er, when I asked them fo for some er  tablets he said  alright, can you send down for them?
I said yes, he said alright I'll have them ready.
They'll be ready.
And same as those, she said, they'll be ready any time after lunch, so I 
Mm.
said thank you very much.
Mm.
And er 
Mm.
but erm  I said to her  over there, I said er, well excuse me I said er da er er a doctor , I, I said took a urine test for me and I said I want to know that I, if he knew the results?
She said, well I'll look up  well he never told her  and he never told me!
No.
No.
And so she looked up, she said, that is right  she said, alright, and er he prescribed some more water pills.
Well why didn't he  get on with it?
People complain that these tests seem to take longer than they need to.
Well I think so, yeah!
Whether the hold up is at the hospital  or in the erm  surgery  I 
Yes!
honestly don't know!
But it does seem to take a while.
Oh dear oh dear!
Oh what have I done?
What?
 
Oh!
Oh it's just a 
You can't be 
Yes I can Stanley it's just a
it's just an outdated bill.
Is it?
That's all, came out of my 
Well 
pocket.
the thing is, after all's said and done if er,i i if there's a little pain I get it, not him!
Absolutely!
So he can hang on can't he?
That's right!
There's a  no, I don't think he's too obliged as he should be!
No, he's not a, I don't think he's as a as some 
They tell me that  is a, is a, a lot better value.
He is wonderful!
They 
He 
say he's a nice little fellow!
My gosh, he's wonderful!
Everybody wants him you know.
Yes.
I should think his list is absolutely full by now.
Yes, of course.
Erm, the first time I met him was when he was doing a very tricky  stitching job, I took Mollie up
Yes.
because she'd cut her leg
Yes.
and er  I took her up there  and her si , skin is like tissue paper
Yes.
I don't know how that man  managed to get the two edges to meet  but he did a wonderful job on it!
And he was so nice to her when he was doing it.
Yes, he's a nice person of
You're very nice!
then Mrs erm  er,, you know, who had the mu 
Oh yes!
she think a lot of him!
Lucky girl!
Yeah.
Those people who live there  in, up in Framlingham are very lucky!
Ha?
Yes.
And those people who live near enough 
Yes.
you see, to the main surgery.
Well of course when  is out, they they give you the the  's number
That's right.
in fact, one time when they was out  they give me a number, I go , and I got !
Oh yes!
Yes.
Well  and I had er er erm erm  what's the name?
Ha!
What do you call them,?
A tummy upset?
No!
Skin!
Oh, not erm  shingles?
Shingles, I had a touch 
Oh!
of shingles.
Gosh!
Mm.
And I said to him, he said what's the matter?
And I told him, I said I've got shingles  so I said well I got them  he said and  red round the stomach.
Ha, ha, ha, he said!
I thought to myself, not so much of the ha, ha, ha!
That's what he's li , er, wasn't a way to tell nobody was it?
No, it wasn't.
You see, that's another one.
He didn't feel it did he?
No, he didn't feel, absolutely 
No!
Stanley!
No, that's not 
I thought to myself, who's this then?
That's something I don't sa , not so matter that I could have told him!
Yes.
That isn't a way to get through to people!
No it isn't!
No it's not.
Cos after all, we don't go private but we're paying!
Tha abs 
And I've payed for years and years for myself and four other people besides!
Mm.
Mm.
No, some 
Yes.
of them get too  snooty in a way.
Yes , they get, they're a bit less committed.
I think the 
And, as you say with , well if he can go fishing and shooting, I don't know about that, they take priority!
Yes.
Yes, that's true.
Mhm.
There's another very nice one there, he's the latest to have come  erm  
.
What in 
oh and he's just 
at Framlingham?
Yes.
And he's very young, he's i , I met him  twice, when I was with people who  were dying
Yes.
and erm  in fact, yes, but both of just had died and we sent for  the doctor and it's
Aha.
it was he who came  and erm  he was absolutely marvellous!
I thought his manner was  just right.
Makes all the difference doesn't it?
Oh yes!
It does make a lot of 
I mean 
difference, yes 
a person like that  can help another person to get well can't they?
They can!
They can.
I mean,th there is something to be said for the manner towards you isn't there?
Ooh yes!
Yes.
Yes!
That's true.
I mean, when you look forward to seeing the doctor and one thing and another, and saying, have a conversation with them, that's a different story innit?
That's true.
And buck you up a bit.
Oh absolutely!
That's something you 
Absolutely!
Yes!
if you think to yourself well if I can have a  a quarter of an hour's chat with him, that'd be worth something.
That's right.
That's true.
Yes.
I don't know why some of them get like that, well of course they shouldn't be doctors any how.
And tha tha th th a doctor should have a nice personality!
He should.
I think in some cases, Stanley, not only in the me , medical profession  the more people are paid  the less committed they seem to be to the job!
Yes, they do, they get independent!
Yes.
They begin to feel that the job is there so that they can earn a living, rather than that they are doing the job itself!
That's right , yes.
Yes.
Mm.
Th th er theirselves, they take priority not the patient!
That's what I feel.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sorry about it because  you know, how I feel about the  medical profession and the nursing 
Yes.
profession.
Yes.
Ye , I mean I'm passionately keen!
But erm  I I think some of them let us down a bit.
Mm.
Yes.
Well there you are, I don't know whether it's wrong.
Course, they drop onto you any old time if they come but if they can't 
Oh yes, if they want to come it doesn't matter if it's convenient to you or not  does it !
Not a bit of it!
Not a bit of it!
Oh no 
That's true.
not a bit of it.
That's true.
Well I mean after all they want er an appointment!
Yes.
But you don't get no appointment!
That's right, you don't.
Oh no!
You see 
That's true.
you take second place, definitely!
Yes.
I'm sorry 
Well 
it is true with some 
I mean, after all 
of them.
you're, we're their customers!
Ah, that's right!
That's their living innit?
That's right.
Withou , they need er er anyone like ourselves, well, er er they'd have nothing to do!
That's right.
Absolutely!
 
And of course they're not so hard pressed as people are in these big cities!
Oh no!
You know, they have a nicer time of it here altogether don't they?
Oh undoubtedly!
Undoubtedly!
Yes.
They do.
Because, I mean, there you are, look, I mean  for argument's sake, now , well they have e e every Tuesday off or some Monday or Tuesday off don't he?
Mhm.
He does.
The same as that Doctor  used to come down and er
Oh yes!
for him.
Mm.
He was quite a nice fellow!
Mm.
So far.
Yes, he's in  Debenham now.
Debenham, yes.
Mm.
He lived on the green didn't he,?
He did.
Yes.
Yes.
Do he live at Debenham now?
Er, I think he does live at Debenham.
Yes.
He , yeah.
I know he operates from there anyway.
Yeah.
Right.
Mm.
Yes.
But then I mean   come and saw me once, you see, when I wasn't there like that and  he he tested from top to bottom, he said well  ar ar after we sit and talked, and like he said well I better give you the once over, I said th er, certainly.
And so he he tested and such like and  he shook his head and he said well  I don't know, I can't find anything wrong with you.
No.
And he said you're a better man than I am!
Really?
Yeah.
Aha.
Yes.
And that's what  said, and that's what
That's what the hospital said!
Yes!
Remember?
Yes!
And that is what er Doctor  said!
Yes.
And !
Yes.
I've had four doctors tell me I'm a better man than them!
Well you wouldn't be ninety five if you were weakling would you Stanley?
No I don't suppose so.
I don't suppose so.
Poor old Doctor , he said you'll never wear your heart out.
Really?
He said, whereas an ordinary man live till they're  seventy  you'll live till you're ninety!
Fancy!
He knew, you see.
See an 
Yes.
and  and when er erm  come over here the last time  er, I I told him a a that he say, Doctor , you see, told  what he said, he is a clever old boy weren't he?
Yes.
Well he was.
said that!
said that, yes, yes.
Yes.
Aha.
And they don't often speak like that of one another.
No, they don't often refer to one another do they?
No they don't, that's right.
You see it's not thought to be the thing 
That's right.
to do.
That's right.
Ah!
Yes.
Oh he was a, he was a lovely man, wasn't he, Doctor ?
Oh aye, I liked him, yeah.
George liked him.
Did he?
Yes, yes, quite good.
Yes.
Yes, well of course they 
Yes, he ought used to be, he was in Scotland he wasn't bro , brought George .
Did he?
Oh yes, yes 
Yes.
yes.
Oh he was a real gentleman.
Yes , no problem like that.
Wonderful!
Well George got on with a lot of people like that but of course, he was a Mason you see.
Oh, was he?
He is that, but that's why he kept them  he used to go down there with him, he got a big photograph of Captain  like that er, in his room here and so on.
Aha.
Well  a man of nearly seventy years!
Is that so?
Yeah.
My God!
They had  they had a few minutes silence for him when he died down Framlingham.
Did they?
Yes, they  
Did they?
Because er  er er Len  a Mason you see.
Is he?
Yes.
And he drives in London  er er er for meeting!
Does he really?
They're very keen aren't they?
Yes!
Aha.
Yes, David 
Some 
what's-a-name, er er  said to me, have you ever thought about?
I said I'm past that my dear!
I'm past that .
Noel's not keen on them, he's been asked to become a Mason sometimes 
Yes, right.
but he just, it's not, somehow it's hi , not his sort of thing.
No well erm, I did ask, old Chris  spoke to me once in the park and then there's  and things like that, cos a certain amount of secrecy in the , things like that  and erm  I I sort of turned it down and he even er er er  well while  and  and Len  that   said Stanley did you ever think about joining the Masons?
Well I said I'm too old for that  now.
Mhm.
Mm.
Well you've 
So they 
had plenty to do to fill your time without belonging to
Well yes, after all's 
that sort of thing.
said and done, mm, after all's said and done course I  well I said there's good, bad, and indifferent everything cos I know some Masons who are blinking great rogues, you know!
Mm.
Mm.
Yes!
Mm.
Old George  used to be an old   he was always keen to be executor for anybody you know.
Really?
Oh yes, and he could get executor, he was executor for one poor old lady  old Mrs  used to live on the causeway  er  er er, the first little house  you know where the th th , er you're coming this way  on the causeway  there's The Elms, ain't they?
That's right.
And then on, at the back, there's a little cottage near the start there  she used to live in that little cottage.
Oh yes!
Well  old Jack   er, he di used to do the post round and he lived in the next cottage
Mm.
they were two thick people.
And the old lady when he was out like that, before and he used to go to Framlingham carrying the bags and such like, and then deliver, come back poor old boy!
From the  
He had a little shop  not much, you know just a few things and such like, in those days.
Mhm.
Well, she used to sort of keep shop for him, she was deaf as a post!
Really?
Yeah, she was deaf as a po !
But however, she us , poor old soul, she did her best  well  Jackie's mother used to go see her
Mhm.
and of course when old Jack  died  er, Jack   he left things to her you see
Oh yes.
and that, which is natural.
That was the time when there was a first portable radios come out
Oh!
Yes.
er a Phillips I think, one, one of those portable ones, that was  rather unique.
And  there was a draw  tickets for it  and old Jack  won it!.
Old Jack had won it!
Well, old  was doing the the executorship for them because he poked his nose into everything!
Mhm.
He used to live up at The Dial.
And  poor old Sarah said, well how much did she owe him you see?
Well he said he'd take the radio.
Oh good gracious!
So he took the radio instead of, part payment you see, that was the first time.
Well then, cos he was doing executor for poor old soul  poor old   and er  Ivy used to go and see her pretty frequently, she said do come and see me Mrs ?
Cos she got a little bit lonely.
Mm.
But of course,th , I'd been living at The Haven then, next to the butcher's shop.
Go and see her.
So one day she said to her  Mrs , you haven't got a car have you?
Ivy said no we haven't, she said you will have one day.
Really?
Mhm.
If anything happened to me.
Really?
Aha.
Judge, old  was executor  he went there one day  and he got her to sign her will
Goodness!
Goodness!
in favour of him!
Oh well that's awful Stanley!
That's a Mason!
Yes, oh that's awful!
Mm.
When Ivy went  he took    clerk with them down at   as a witness.
When Ivy went to see her she said oh Mrs   Mr  came to see me yesterday afternoon  he brought another gentleman with him, a nice gentleman so I  she said  I think they were taking the census, they got me to sign a paper.
Oh dear!
Oh!
And she'd signed her own will!
Oh!
Dear oh dear!
And so when  she died, he swept the deck!
Oh, that is dreadful!
That's a Mason!
Mm.
Mm.
That's dreadful!
Yeah, that's a Mason!
Mm.
Now, there's another one.
Old Mrs    old lady who was in Framlingham, the dentist?
No, I don't reme , no, I don't remember 
Well in any case 
that name.
She, she come from Walthamstow.
And then when her 
Ah yeah.
her husband died  she'd picked out a bit of land  all this  and I borrowed this and one thing and another, so well they never found a penny!
Mhm.
If we hadn't got the money to pay for cash on delivery I never want it!
No.
I done without!
Mhm.
Well  we kept on like that  and  er er  people like that we were packing up wholesale  so  erm  I've lost myself a little bit now.
No, you were talking about er  about your  cousin  Mr .
Oh yes, that's 
Yes.
right!
Yes, I was talking about  he used to come over here a lot.
Mm.
Come over here and spent his  silver wedding just to come here and his golden wedding!
Mhm.
He loved to come here take a  slog and go down the meadows.
Oh yes!
That was his type.
Aha.
He he he er loved that!
Mhm.
And he loved a horse better than he would a Rolls Royce!
Really?
Yes 
Mm mm.
he was that type of person.
Yes.
Well  I knew someone in  and I thought to myself I, perhaps he might lend me a hand?
I did touch them one time you see but of course there was nothing doing he wan me!
Some years afterwards  walking down here after he'd  been his for his  silver wedding, golden wedding and so on er, coming down that  dri drift down from the back   he looked at me  he said I don't know boy!
I got a nice bit of money and such like  I don't know who to leave it to.
I said, well I don't want it .
I'd got on my feet you see
Yes, that's right.
 

Yes.
Mhm.
That was good.
He never forgot that!
Is that so?
On two occasions he , repeated me that like that.
Mm mm.
He used to come over here.
He went off and told his gardener, Wilfred   he said Stanley won't have any.
That was a surprise to him!
Mm.
Good on you!
But I hadn't got much but I'd got on my feet.
That's right, and you didn't need anybody else's!
And I thought to myself, keep it boy!
Yes.
Yes.
I told him .
Yes.
Yes.
But otherwise said I could have it, he would of left that to me.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Cos he always over here!
Yes.
Always over here.
Yes.
But that was the biggest shock he ever had!
That you didn't want it.
That was.
And 
Mhm.
thought to myself, yes  in a sense I could of done with that so far but I thought, no, I'll stick up and  
Yes your independence 
stand on my own legs!
So I told 
means a lot.
him.
Ha.
I told him.
Yes.
And he
Yes.
and Wilfred  told me himself  when I went up there!
Really?
Aha.
Yes , he told me what   said to him.
Yes.
It all comes round.
Oh yes!
And it's done you no harm 
It always comes round!
has it Stanley?
Pardon?
It's done you no harm to stand on your own feet has it?
No, it hasn't!
No.
No, it 
No.
hasn't.
No.
That's the way.
If only people would be a bit more like that sometimes today.
What I wa , what I want to get  I've saved up an ,an an an an earned it and 
Yes.
Lily and I like that  and we bought the self and we felt independent.
That's right.
And I've always was a little bit independent.
Yes.
Oh it's the best way to be Stanley.
Yes!
It's the best way to be.
Aha.
And a fellow said to me  about two ye , two to three years ago I expect it was  two telegraph people  up that pole out an just outside of my gate  and he's still there and I walk along the gate  and he turned round to me  he say you're a lucky man!
I said what do you mean,yo , me a lucky man?
Well he said, living in a nice place like this.
You call it luck?
I said, when I earned a pound I spent nineteen and sixpence, not a guinea like some of you!
Right .
And he never said no more.
That's right.
No.
Ah, they caught them.
That's right.
Two people come now doing the water, the  the stop cap  and one fellow looked across  coo he said a big , I said I'll have a run a  over the left  I said, now you wouldn't would you?
Cos I don't mind, I lo I thi , I'm not afraid of work.
No.
No.
Jolly good!
They're the sort of people you get.
That's right!
Absolutely!
Yes.
I I don't know, by the way, there ar , your gate is open and there is a er, red van out there.
I opened it.
They do, oh!
Th , oh for me did you?
Yes.
Ah, that's sweet of you!
So when I go  you'd like me to shut it probably would you?
Well i i if you don't mind?
If not 
 
I can shut it.
Oh no!
Well it doesn't take me a minute.
I just wondered whether it was because the erm  men with the red van at the gate there 
Oh no no the 
are doing something here.
No,no!
Cos I 
They're working are they?
I knew you were coming and so I went and opened the gate.
Ah, so you did.
That's sweet of you!
I thought   
That's kind!
Stanley I do not 
You know 
erm  yeah?
Pardon?
That take all sorts to make a world you know.
Oh yes , indeed it does!
Oh it 
Yep.
does!
And we've got them too, Stanley!
We've got them!
A lot of people 
I think we've got all sorts!
now like this.
Well George  come the other day, now he's a working fellow!
Mm.
He's got a little sense!
Mm.
He earned a lot of money  and he save it, he then bought a British car.
Mm, yes.
He paid for it!
Mm.
That's the sor he say, nobody need go short today!
That's true.
Mm.
Other people  what do they do?
They take the money  they go and buy videos, they buy records, they go and  bu ba for fo football and all si 
Mhm.
they spend the money in the wrong direction!
There's no return!
No.
That's right Stanley.
And then they 
It's 
say they're short!
Yes.
That's what you've been saying all the time this sort of bank lending's been going on haven't you?
Yes!
Mm.
Yes!
It's madness really!
Ooh yes!
And then 
Mhm.
th a th th I mean th , all these repossessed houses  they're lived far beyond their end zone!
Yes , they do.
They're ordinary working people, they wanna be independent gentlemen!
That's right.
And the banks and building societies have encouraged them!
They have, I'm afraid, they have!
Pushed the money onto them!
And now of course they're paying the price too because 
Course!
they're in a mess!
It's their own fault!
Absolutely!
As you make your bed you lie on it!
That's right.
That's as simple as that!
After all said and done, people live 
It is really.
far beyond their income  and when they get the money they spend it in the wrong direction
That's right, because they haven't 
haven't they?
had to work so hard for it perhaps, you see.
No!
They've borrowed 
You see 
it instead.
you see  go to a football match, or buying some  er electrical appliance  appeal to them far more  than paying the rent!
Yes, that's right.
But a lot of people 
They don't pay the rent, no, ah ra , the tax payers have to make that up!
That's true in many cases  that's true.
They've got swelled heads, people have!
Yes , they have Stanley.
It's very foolish!
I wonder if anybody would know  that what happened here  ah er er  two or three year ago was a  up till re recently  they know very well that couldn't last!
Couldn't last, could it?
Couldn't last!
I know,
It wasn't reality.
went and borrowed an eighty thousand pound and bought a house
That's right.
Mhm.
well, he had to scrape to pay the rent at all!
Then, on the other hand he had to go short indoors, well then when the  I er th th ,th er the interest went up, cos he !
They don't work out how much they're paying for their money 
No, they don't!
do they?
No.
They go to silly people like 
It is really!
that!
Is really.
And the first thing they do th they go to the wo er er bo the boss of the firm where they work for  and want more money!
That's right.
They can't manage.
We couldn't do that!
What do you 
Mhm.
think we are!
Yes .
They, and and they they've they've on the ba ba had their unions run the blessed country!
Well they did.
Certainly, they did.
I sa 
And they will again, Stanley!
I said
If we get the wrong people in.
that  Jackie will tell you the same, I told her mother anything from thirty to forty years ago  I said, that don't matter some toss what political power they get in power you'll find the unions will run the country
Yes.
the way they're going on!
Yes.
They demand things!
Yes.
If, for argument's sake, they want fifty pound, they demand sixty!
That's right.
That's right.
And they know they'll get something.
That's right.
Well
Mhm.
all that money that they keep demanding from the  er th wa th wa the firms and such like that  ought to have been ploughed back into the firm!
That's right.
That's right Stanley.
If they robbed the firm, they're robbing themselves!
Yes, and then they are.
Anthony  said years ago, when the rail ma men went on strike  why do it?
You'll only bring misery and distress on your own country!
Absolutely!
And that's as true today!
Yes.
It is!
But they can't see it!
All of them around  they kill the goose that laid the golden egg.
Well that's the trouble, they do!
Yes.
Yes, but then 
They do.
these firms are gonna pack up!
Exactly!
Exactly, and then they lose the lot then don't they?
there's only one thought for th sa for them and that's for theirse 
I got erm  Patsy coming in for a bite of lunch
Oh yes.
erm  because we didn't see her last week.
Yes.
Well we 
And we 
better get the sweeper sometimes then.
Oh you need to Stanley won't you?
Because er  I can't bear to think of you without this room with that lovely fire in.
Well, there you are.
There's always some, look at my birds!
Oh yes, the birds are there still aren't they?
Here's some fat for them.
That's your medicine Stanley.
Just a minute.
Come on sweetheart.
Aren't they marvellous!
They come straight away don't they?
Yeah.
They're wonderful!
That's your medicine  there  your eggs there.
The instructions on them I suppose?
Sorry?
The instructions on it are 
Oh 
they?
Oh, it says, Stanley  well you can read it I'm sure.
Please repeat the water test  when you've finished the tablets.
Please what?
Repeat the water test
Oh yeah.
when you've finished the tablets.
Repeat?
Yes.
Ah!
That's 
Yes.
the word I wanted.
After you've taken those.
Righto!
I expect they'll tell you how many to take.
I sho , I suppose so.
Can I just check?
I'm sure they will.
Yes, you look , you look at them.
I'm sure they will Stanley.
You look at them.
Whoops!
Yes, that one's two tablets twice a day  and that's for the water test.
I see.
Alright?
So I gotta take them both?
What 
Er 
are they for?
bu , you take that  to , er two tablets twice a day  that's it.
Two  tablets twice a day.
So that's probably 
Yes, well what are these?
morning and evening.
They are perhaps new ones, I don't know.
Are they?
I dunno, I'll take them but 
Yes.
Two twice a day.
Yes.
And then this is for your water test.
Right.
And er, what 
When those are finished.
When those are finished?
Yes.
That's just to put the water in  to put your urine in you see.
Let me see it before, ooh I mustn't open it because it'll be ste 
Oh no!
it'll be sterile, you see.
It is, it's 
Ooh he want, he want that for a test?
He wants that,yo , he wants you to put some water in that for a test, some of your water in that 
That's right.
Fine.
for a test   
after I've used them?
After you've used those.
That's alright.
And Stanley, we don't open that in the meantime because 
No, no!
it's sterile.
Yes.
And so it must be for your test, you see?
Yes , quite.
Okay?
So after I've finished those lot twice a day
Yes.
Well they're the
Two twice a day.
Two twice a day.
Yes.
Well that's four a day.
It is.
Then er, put some urine in there
Yes.
and let him have it.
That's right!
That's it.
Well I can send it down with anybody.
That's right.
Oh yes, well er  er, yes you can because you need to send it down when it's fresh.
Oh yes!
Er, so if nobody's going down give me a ring and I'll come and get it.
Thank you.
Alright?
Thank you.
So erm 
Yes.
your fat, what 
I might get the old lady to go down for me.
Well er, only if she's going.
If she's going.
Yes.
That's right.
If she's going.
There's the fat Stanley.
How much do you want?
It's one twenty nine please.
One  twenty did you say?
Er, one twenty nine Stanley.
Please.
Twenty
If you've got a ten, I've got a one.
I got, I've got one .
Twenty five
Ah.
six, seven  eight, nine.
Good!
That's clever.
That's right.
You almost always have change don't you?
Pardon?
Almost always have the right change.
Yes.
Yes.
 
Try to.
Yes.
Try to.
Try to.
There.
Thank you very much.
You're very welcome Stanley.
And I'll see you again  next week, but if you need anything in the meantime give me a ring will you?
I will, thank you very much.
Do that dear.
Thank you.
And, try to keep warm and keep out of this wind.
Yes, that's right.
Bye bye dear!
That's right.
And I'll  shut the gate.
Alright.
Okay, so you tha , you don't need to come out at all.
There we are.
Oh the wind is still cold!
It's keen!
It's keen, indeed!
Yes it is.
Yes.
Right.
Bye bye then Stanley!
Bye bye!
Bye bye!
erm  I think it can't be bad for you  because  you do quite a lot of the same exercise as you'd do in proper aerobics
Yes.
but you're in the water the whole time.
I don't even know what proper aerobics are anyhow.
Oh you just keep moving the whole time.
Running on the spot and waving your arms about 
Just seem to keep moving all the time without even running on the spot.
Yeah well  this is, this is  you know  it's very difficult to run in the water
I know it is.
cos it keeps getting round your feet and sort of 
 
making you drop over.
Yeah.
And I suppose developing the muscles that keep you  from dropping over  it's pro can't be, can't be a bad thing.
I suppose it can't, no.
I 
And then you do other exercises like lying on your back, putting your feet  your  from the knees downwards over the edge of the pool  and then trying to do sit ups.
Good heavens!
I'm too old for any of that.
But Noel, isn't exercise against resistance is supposed to have some special benefit isn't it?
Well I'm doing that all the time, I'm doing it with you my love.
 
Oh come off it.
Erm  I don't know, I, I, I, I  I just feel that this is  that sort of exercise where  er
Ooh sorry.
it only lasts an hour, it's not going to do any harm
No I'm sure it isn't.
it's erm a good thing to be doing.
Because swimming's 
I think something that does do harm is jogging.
Yeah well
Well yes that's a beast.
I, I did a little jog this morning with the dogs cos it was too cold to walk.
Oh 
Ah yes.
And I've got another one this afternoon I think.
Have you ever been in the sauna at er Woodbridge?
No I haven't.
Er er no I haven't either.
Er I one, went into one at Iceland that was  it was lovely.
I've been in a sauna in London  I belong to a health club there.
Mm.
I used to play squash.
Mm.
That's a violent one isn't it, squash?
Yes.
I, I can't think that really violent exercise is a good thing generally is it?
Something that's more measured
Oh I don't think  I don't think it hurts when you're young, I think when you're older you should only do it if you've done warming up first.
I think so too probably, and you've been used to it.
That let's us off, isn't it nice?
I think the warming up exercises in themselves are a good thing though
Mm.
even if you don't do anything after
Mm.
after warming up.
The class I go to on Monday evenings  erm  we do warming up exercises  and I'd be quite happy if they just stayed warming up exercises for the whole hour.
Yes.
Have you got someone properly qualified taking them?
Yes, she's very good.
Mm.
I went to a sauna in Iceland
Mm?
and then was able to straight, in, in the hotel it was
Yes.
straight up in the lift to my bedroom and it was lovely you know, yeah  in the hot, in the  swimming pa pool
Mm.
or through the shower then in the swimming pool then back again  and when I'd finished with it I went straight upstairs to my room and I went to sleep straight away, it was lovely.
I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow  because that's the proper end isn't it?
Mm and you should beat yourself with twigs as well.
I'm not  I don't know really about that.
Oh you should definitely do that, I mean 
That borders on the nasty I think.
They had a  there was a sort of electric burner in the place as a whole
Mm.
where they kept on throwing on
Water to
water with some erm sort of fir smelling in it.
Oh yes, it made steam.
Mm.
Fine mm.
That's it.
I should apologize for canned soup, but I spent so long talking to Stanley this morning
Mm?
you know sometimes you can just tell he wants you to talk to him, and erm  so I er couldn't make a proper soup, sorry, but this is 
I think 
good actually I think.
Yes, which is it?
Is it Heinz?
Heinz tomato   
I  I made some stock the other day
Mhm.
and I put some of it in the freezer
Yes, ideal.
in erm sort of bowls.
What did you use for your stock?
Some bones.
And?
Oh  some onions and 
Carrot?
carrot, yes.
Celery?
That gives a lovely flavour.
I don't think I had any celery, I had, I had  put in whatever I had in the house and sort of various herbs and spices and things.
Did you put the bones in the stock before or after the dogs had had them?
 

During?
During 
The dogs went into it instead.
Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make.
No they wouldn't.
Mhm.
Erm
All that hair.
Yuk.
erm  no what happened was that he gave me some bones that were far too big for the dogs.
So I made stock out of those.
Where they gorgeous marrow bones?
That  
Yes.
Oh yes, they make wonderful stock don't they?
Mm.
Well normally when he gives marrow bones I ask him to chop them up a bit smaller
Mm.
but he gave them to me practically
Mm.
He's an obliging chap isn't he?
Mm.
I always feel  that when he's giving,, because he gives them to one, doesn't charge for any
Mm?
er anything for the bones, one can hardly say  erm give that another whack across the knuckle because
He wouldn't
the big knuckle has so much locked inside 
He wouldn't mind.
it doesn't it?
I do.
Do you?
Yes.
I should really.
He wouldn't mind.
I ought to have courage.
He charges high enough prices for his other things.
Yes he, you're right, mhm.
Erm  when you do your stock  do you first of all  roast the bone?
No but that is erm  er a counsel of perfection or something isn't it?
It it's a method anyway.
Mm.
Erm  do you?
No.
Well I didn't because  I just couldn't be bothered to put the oven on to get as hot as that for such short period of time.
What in fact does it do?
Oh I should think it erm melts out the marrow and does all sorts of quite good things for it.
It probably gives it a good colour too.
It gives it colour  erm I'm sure because of the, of the fact that they're roasted.
There's one thing that erm I sometimes do to give it colour, is once I've taken off the outside skin of the onion, the very outside
Mm?
I put the next one in.
Mm?
Does that, that gives it colour does it?
I read that somewhere, mm.
Mm.
But roasting them, I wouldn't like to get them with any sort of burnt  taste.
Well I don't think it would give a burnt taste but I think, I think it probably could do quite a lot of good for it.
Mm.
Er I just read it in er I was reading Delia.
Mm, yes.
Oh yes she's good.
And she tells you to do that does she?
Yes.
It's the matter of the moment really, you just fling them into a roasting tin don't you and put it in the oven?
And that's alright if you've got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to start
Yes, start from scratch.
heating it up, mm.
Now  when I was away staying with my cousins
Mm.
he is a G P  in High Wycombe  and he's a fundholder.
Oh good, tell me about it.
Well he's also been on hundreds of committees because they were sort of one of the early ones to be done 
Mm.
and they have a battery of sort of board members  drawn from here there and everywhere, including a fair quantity of  redundanted service people.
Oh.
They had an S A S officer running, running them 
Is that to get you ri to get rid of the patients he didn't want ?
No, it was to get rid of the Health Service.
He, he, he said that at one point this chap had used the phrase that  well that they were going for controlled destabilization from the Health Service.
Controlled what?
Destabilization.
Oh.
The S A S man was?
Mm.
Why?
That's what the aim of  the people doing it was.
You mean the official government line?
Mm or that's what they er  or maybe that was his interpretation of it anyway this  was a phrase that came out  in, in the actual meetings.
And then he told me a hilarious story about the way in which the chairman of the committee, I'm not sure quite what particular branch in the world he'd come from but  he was looking at the figures, I suppose it was an accountant  looking at the, the figures saying now why is it that the amount spent on district nurses has gone up?
So he was told petrol has gone up.
He said yes but you now have your health centre and the district nurses work from there.
So erm they all looked at him, you know, the district nurses  so John said to this man what  there are some of our patients  who are housebound 
Yes.
and some of them  as well as being housebound, maybe aren't very well and are bedbound 
Mm 
and the district nurses visit them in their homes.
He had to explain it to this man.
Good god.
Where did he fund this committee from one has to ask immediately.
he's not given his committee  it's wished on him.
The local authority 
 
the local authority creates the committee.
But I, I had no idea that he then had to be  that, being given his own funding, he then had to be  organized by a committee.
Oh that's outrageous.
Local council 
I think it must have been some sort of
Yeah.
thing like that, I don't know.
Well it doesn't seem sensible, I thought it was the G Ps getting control.
I mean this is what's going to happen  to the detriment of the health service right through
Yes.
administration by people who don't know what it's all about.
That's right.
what has happened to a lot of these hospitals hasn't it?
Well it seems to be still going on.
What do you make of this idea of building a new hospital at Norwich  with fewer beds?
I can't understand it because if they've got fewer beds why don't they, they just hide a few of the beds they've got already?
Absolutely.
Mm why do they have to have a green field site  and start again?
Is it because they're going to incorporate a lot of high tech  treatments?
I think so, yes.
Mm and, you see erm  it is a fact that they need fewer hospital beds nowadays because
Mm.
the, the hospital stays are dramatically shorter than they were.
Mm yes but we're coming up to a time when er the quantity of old people is going to be rather high   than before because we're all healthier.
Mm.
Mm.
They'll have something special for them like concentration camps.
I know.
Th they've got those in Ipswich already haven't they?
That's what they've made the old Anglesey Road hospital into.
Is that so?
Mm something like that.
I wonder how it really goes.
I wonder 
I don't know.
Erm  well it's 
Oh this is disappointing because I thought that with G P who'll  knows what he requires  and what his patients require was going to have  erm a pretty  er erm
Well you can't leave a G P to spend the money like he likes, you've got to have a committee for it.
You think about it.
 
You, you know?
Ah!
Ah.
Yes anyway have you heard about how they do the costing?
Will  was telling me about it, how  how  how they 
Oh do tell me because I  
how they cost erm  something like a tonsillectomy.
Mm.
And how do they?
Well apparently they count the procedures that are involved in doing it
Mm?
erm they have a price per procedure
Yes?
and they tot it up.
Mm.
But they haven't got it quantified to such a point where they can actually distinguish a tonsillectomy which might have a lot of procedures but actually takes about half a minute  with er other things that are, you know, much much more complicated and the cost of tonsillectomies is unreasonably high  compared with erm, you know, with  
 
Yes.
Really?
Mm.
They haven't, they haven't got the pricing right.
And  I can understand them not having the pricing right, I don't think they've spent long enough  working out what the prices of things are.
They've dearly gone on for years not knowing, let alone tonsillectomies, what 
Yes, they didn't 
these wretched erm
they didn't know 
transplants costs.
they didn't know what they cost  but equally being asked to budget  against not knowing what things cost 
Mm mm 
is er equally stupid.
Yes it is.
Because er er ya  absol 
But then, but then the er the whole thing gets knocked for six anyway because of general  unpredictableness of, of, of illness.
Well it does I suppose.
It does.
You can you can apply statistics to it a bit but it's very unlikely the statis st statistics  and what really happens  will always add up in fact.
They, they've suddenly had a few outbreaks of polio haven't they?
Oh have they?
Mm.
I didn't hear that.
I say.
Mhm.
Yep.
They've had the odd child who hasn't been erm whatnotted  and some various 
Ah!
various men seem to have caught it from changing their nappies.
Yes!
I did hear of that.
I'm sorry I wasn't relating it to erm  to polio.
Mm.
Erm 
Well you know, you've only got to get maybe smallpox back again and that will knock all their predictions for six.
Erm
They say they've wiped smallpox off the face of the earth.
Yes they do you see.
That's the doubtful one isn't it, because it's gone.
It's supposed to be completely gone.
Yeah but do they, do they inoculate children against it at all?
No I don't think  no I don't think we have smallpox inoculation er of, of children do we?
Don't know we I mean we used to  
Because they say it's  it's, it's  gone completely.
Erm  sorry love we need a fork for that.
Perhaps the meat fork from the shop would do nicely.
No er er   erm  it's all in the cutting, of course it is very  no that's pork and Noel daren't touch it so I've got two slices so that you and I could have one.
That's very nice, thank you.
And Noel will have the other.
Erm
I haven't had any pork for ages.
it's so new to them that they're bothering to cost it, but how did we go on in the older days?
I'm trying to think.
Did we know anything about what our operations were costing?
I can't remember.
Well if y you if if you go to a BUPA hospital you go pa you pay  a sort of erm, you know, related type of  
Yes a figure that's been around that anyway, yes.
Mm?
Ya.
But I don't know
I'm just having that to start with I think .
erm  I do I don't, I mean I don't know how accurate it is or whether it's sort of, you know, a set of figures they decided to put on.
It wouldn't relate to what it costs 
to keep to keep to keep their profits going.
Yes, that's right.
Well it probably does relate 
That's what it  that'll be it.
it probably does relate pretty well.
I bet it doesn't relate to an actual operation in a  general hospital because you've got so many people wanting their rake off in a private one surely?
I mean haven't you?
Yes.
Yes.
That erm
Yes their profit  
Ya that's right.
rather tired  bit fed up with private medicine at the moment.
Oh because of Richard?
I'm convinced that 
Richard  
you know Richard  er er ?
Mm?
Had he gone to a  National Health hospital
Mm.
with the request to have that back thing done for him
Mhm.
I'm convinced that at the age of seventy eight people do they would have said don't bother.
Yes I'm sure they would have done.
Ya.
And er would have erm  perceived that he wasn't greatly hampered by it, but once you've got a surgeon who is going to get a fat fee  he did say to him are you sure you want this done
Mm.
but Richard was sure he wanted it done  and nothing came between him and that  intention.
And you see he's, it's going to finish him.
He's not going to get better.
No.
Erm  but  did he tol tell you that  the surgeon asked him if he really wanted it done?
Oh yes it's known that he did.
Mm?
He said er you're sure  because it was quite a thought, for a man his age.
Mm.
But I think a surgeon in a National Health would have said  look here I do not recommend this.
Yeah but then the first thing he would have done would have been  got up and gone off and got it done privately.
That is the danger.
He would.
So er the end was I suppose always connectable.
Ya.
If that's, if that's what private will do for you
Mm.
Mm.
I mean, I think, I hadn't realized that they would make different decisions on medical grounds.
Mm  they will, it's more permissive if you're in the private sector.
I'm sure of that.
It doesn't come so hea heavily loaded with advice against things.
What, because it's all too good for the moneybags?
Yes it's, it's I suppose human nature to want to pursue your craft  wherever you can.
Mm.
But erm  but it's been a very bad thing for him.
Yes.
But you see  they've had computers in hospitals now for  years
Mm?
and are, are employing and paying people to work them  but they don't ever seem to come to any  let's say reportable  conclusion about the cost of operations.
I think if we knew what those heart and lung transplants cost, people would be up in arms that the National Health Service is being expected to fund that.
Mm.
Well y they're a little bit like  nuclear electricity in terms of erm  the expensive end aren't they?
Mm.
Mm.
Yes I suppose that's so.
I wish the government could really  tellingly  er do down these dreadful lies and scandal erm  scaremongering things that the  Labour opposition is putting forward.
I mean they don't honestly care two hoots about people, if they can talk about the dreadful state the, the care of old people is in and  all the rest of it and that it's going to get worse, frightening old people.
That's not caring for the community at all.
That's just erm  politicking isn't it?
Yes.
I can think of nothing worse than Kinnock coming into power.
Oh!
Imagine  how people like erm  erm  Helmut Kohl and
Cook?
Not Cook
Oh.
because he's in his own party, I mean Cook yes well he's a snidey little thing, I'm talking about the erm ambassadors and the politicians, the ministers who would be 
Oh yes, oh lord yes.
you know, opposing him.
Yes.
They'd just, they'd just run over him  absolutely, whilst he was grinning.
One can't see him in an ambassadorial role at all can one?
No.
It may not come to it.
But this recession is quite a problem.
Oh it must be.
It's a worldwide thing though.
Mm.
Yes but the trouble about it is that the English are so insular  that lots of them don't, don't realize it or won't believe it.
No.
That's true.
They, they regard that as an excuse.
Mm.
Have some more chutney, it was given to us by our German daughter-in-law.
Oh 
So it will be perfect.
Did she make it herself?
She did.
Goodness.
It was our Christmas present wasn't it?
I forget what it was, was it her present?
Mm.
Well has it been nice not having to go to France?
Mm.
Except of having to go to London instead.
Mm I couldn't tell how many people would agree with you about that one  that London could be at least a bit preferable to Paris.
Well  Helen's a bit like you  she, she sort of perks up when she starts to smell the petrol fumes  
Mm!
Ya.
And she said she had a lovely time.
She went to an exhibition, she  went for a browsing sort of shop.
She said the shops were empty.
Mm.
Shopping is much more comfortable now.
Mm.
I'd better go and try and do some some time.
Mm.
There's a lovely suit in   at the moment in the sale in  what's that place called?
?
Near   
 
Mhm.
it's really lovely.
Smart, one could go to town or anywhere in it.
Mm.
Why is it you don't buy it then?
Well because it's darkish in colour  and I'd rather promised myself that if I have anything new now  it'll be of a brighter colour.
Oh well go and buy the thing before somebody else does, go up this afternoon.
Dearest I'm saying it's a dark colour.
Yes.
Yeah but you could wear it with, you could wear bright things with it.
Mm.
Shush, don't 
 
push me, I don't need pushing.
No no really  I, I, I've resolved, it's charcoal grey you see
It sounds very smart Enid.
Very smart.
We're going to have Princess Diana.
My size too.
Is it?
Mm.
It's got your name written on it.
Mm.
Why don't you go up and buy the thing?
No.
I'll phone her and ask her if she's got it in red.
You can pinch a bit more of my er  
Like the telephone woman.
Mm?
Like the telephone woman.
Oh er isn't she oh isn't she super?
I don't like the advertisements they're doing for the telephone now though.
Which are they?
Oh they have this silly man who  picks up the telephone in a  he's er got a chef's hat on and he says Giovanni's  and then it was, it turns out to be one of his old friends so he lapses into sort of Glaswegian.
Oh no!
I haven't heard that one.
Oh but Maureen erm  er what's she called?
Maureen Lipman, yes 
Lipman, Lipman.
is very good on those isn't she?
Mm.
She's the right sort.
Erm  the thing that I  feel I couldn't go to see her in  is erm Hello Joyce.
Yes, that Joyce Grenfell thing?
Mm.
A bit of it was on the television.
Yes, I saw that bit and it wasn't good
No.
because sh Joyce Grenfell was such a lady, it came through.
And  and wh and er  Maureen Lipman is much more earthy
Mm.
and that came through and it was no good.
If you've seen Joyce Grenfell you, you couldn't  
Funny thing to put 
No.
a Jewess to  to try to represent Joyce Grenfell anyhow isn't it?
Yes.
Yes in a way, except she   well you could do, it could be done.
Did you feel that about her on television?
Well I felt, I just didn't know what it was but it lacked the sort of charm that it had before.
Mm.
Completely.
Almost thought when she, when it was  when it was erm  er mentioned in the first place that she was going to do it
Mhm.
I almost thought ooh  you know I'd love to write and say oh don't, don't.
Joyce Grenfell was such a lady.
You couldn't say that to her cos she didn't  it would be insulting but  in fact, that's the big difference.
Mm.
Talking of things like this, you know  er some people have postcards with their name on  in black, across the top  
Oh yes they do.
Yes that's right, they do.
Mm.
Well  er all sorts of funny people like have them like erm  Iris  has, has them.
Oh does she?
And does Jane .
Yes.
Yes she has them
Mm.
my aunt has them, my father used to have them.
Mm.
and  so I've always associated them with sort of erm, you know, what people had before all those sticky labels came  
Mm yes.
People who did things properly?
Mm.
Mm.
Well  when I was in the London office one chap who is an  east end Jew made good, his name is Ralph , erm suddenly gasped and said gosh isn't this wonderful?
So I sort of was called to look at it, and I said oh yes, all the people I know who have got those are over seventy.
 

And was it one of his own?
No no, someone had sent it to him.
Somebody had sent to him.
And he, he thought that it was  such a touch of class about it.
Mm.
Mm.
And I expect he's gone away to get them printed now 
Oh probably.
because I s I said, I said 
How funny .
I said well they're just what people had before  the sticky labels.
Yes.
And he dragged out his sticky labels  which, which had got blue stripes on them
No?
Yes, I thought 
No 
that wasn't terribly elegant  but anyway his blue labels had got, these little sticky labels had got blue stripes on them
top and bottom.
Oh how funny.
Erm  and so I guess he's gone away to get some made.
Mm 
And I said  and of course to do it really properly, you also have envelopes so that if you want to you can stick, stick the card in an envelope that will 
Yes.
fit it.
Cos that's what we used to have.
Mm.
Oh yes it wouldn't go naked through the post would it?
 
Well you can yes you can't 
Mm 
you know, you could use it for quick notes
Mm.
to drop on people's doorsteps
Yes.
or, or
Which is useful.
Yes.
Or if you just want to sort of signify a, a quick thank you to someone.
Mm yes.
Or a quick come
Yes I hadn't thought about that.
Mm mm 
they're they are very useful, I've often thought of having some made
Mm.
because, in fact every time I get one from someone else I always think why haven't I gone and got some of those yet?
I know why, because you're not seventy.
That's right, give me another twenty years.
We had those envelopes er and the cards for our concerts.
Well they were probably erm  invitation to a concert.
Yeah but they were all fixed up to go into the same envelope sort of thing.
Mm.
Yes  
Oh yes you can't , can't use them though.
No.
Got too much detail of where we lived and erm you know  that it was a concert.
But but these  you know, you had your telephone number and  you know, just had a whole statement of everything about you.
Mm mm.
And 
And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send.
Yes.
And it saved you hav it saved you having to do the preliminary thing of saying dear whoever you are
 
Of course, that's right.
That's right.
which was sometimes quite a difficult thing to do.
Well on a personal card you're not supposed to put dear anybody are you so 
I know but
that does make it difficult.
No it made it very easy.
You know, especially when perhaps you were having a mixed sort of meeting
Mm.
wh I remember that when I was  at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in which some of the people from the village were coming who you didn't really know but  they had to be asked
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
well you I mean you, you could cover er cover the whole thing couldn't you?
Mm mm.
Without saying dear so and so.
Yes.
Mm.
 
And without really having to sign it.
You could just put your initial in the corner.
Of course.
Mm that's right it 
Are they called gentle  
Yes 
cards?
Something like that, yes .
safe distance cards.
I must go and get some made.
 
indeed.
 

Oh gosh.
Have you used any of these erm things called Post It?
Oh yes they, they use them a lot at work.
Th but they're useful?
What are they?
Well er they're er like your autumn leaves that you used to leave on everybody's benches
Oh did I?
erm but they've got a sticky bit on them
Oh I know, yes.
and so you, you'd have stuck it on the bench you see erm  and it comes off anything without making a mark on  
Oh yes we've got a little pack of them in London I think on the, by the telephone.
Yes.
That's right, some teeny weeny ones?
Yes.
Mm Folly gave them to you?
They they  they used to call them my autumn leaves er 
erm Patsy and more
Oh have some more
an another piece of ham, do  
have some more ham or you're getting some nice cheese in a minute.
Oh  cheese.
are we having some cheese?
Mm.
Well I think I'll wait for some cheese 
Mm.
Ye yes I used to leave notes 
I'm I'm tr I'm tr I'm trying not to overeat you see?
Yes.
Right.
Please yourself.
I'm trying to avoid   being noticed if I overeat.
You're trying to, you're trying to avoid being starved all the time aren't you darling?
You're allowed to have some water aren't you ?
No no no no no 
It's difficult for you but he's trying to avoid being starved.
Will that plate do?
It'll be fine.
dish you out a larger one.
No no it will be absolutely fine, thank you.
Okay.
Well help yourself, I can recommend  cheese.
Well autumn leave is the best way out of, of  of er communicating.
If I were to turn to a man on a bench
Mm.
and say to him so and so and so and so he'd always answer back and say I want to do it this way
Mhm.
and er the time was wasted, but you give an autumn leaf  a little note saying what it, what you, what you wanted done there wasn't much chance he could argue.
Yes I heard a very interesting conversation on the way down here in that programme Just a Minute 
Oh
you know the one I mean?
I hate it but I'll tell you why in a minute.
Mm mm.
Go on.
Well I don't like it very much but  it has this very interesting discussion as to whether a fax was  cheaper or more expensive than the telephone
Mm?
and  the biggest pro for a fax that I can think of is that you can send the message  and that's that, there's no risk of it dribbling on into, into doubt  
Mm  
As it would on the telephone, yes.
Yes.
How right.
Mm.
So I thought that was quite interesting to think 
Mm and they can't argue with a fax.
think about.
I hate that programme because  I like  I tend to come and  listen to the content of what they're saying
Mm.
and they're only saying it for the sake of keeping going.
Yes  
And then er so it's never, it's never worth  serious attention is it?
Well just occasionally it is.
Sometimes you do get something interesting.
And and and and then 
 
and then they get interrupted and you wish, you know, you wish they hadn't.
That's it, you see  that's full of frustration
Yes it's  
for me  
I don't like it, I, I prefer things like the news quiz
Mm.
or  even  that one about that game with Mornington Crescent in it.
Mornington Crescent?
Yes.
I've heard that phrase used but I don't know what it's for.
Oh well it's, it's where  they say  say a sequence of underground station names or or locations 
Oh 
in London  in, in a sort of clever way that makes it sound as though there's some terrific good reasoning for it
Oh.
and they just say it totally randomly and the last one just  the first pers person who says Mornington Crescent is the winner  but they've made a great big sort of  fiction as to how  why, when it is suitable to say Mornington Crescent 
You have to come to it
Yes.
I, yes I see.
Th there's no logic to it at all but they play it on.
How extraordinary, I've not heard that one.
Mhm.
It's a programme where they also  sing the songs of one tune  wh to another tune.
Oh  you mean the programme where they do that?
Mm.
Erm well that's not  that's not My Music is it?
No.
No.
Erm 
That's erm
can't remember what it's called.
Mm  it's Jazz With Humphrey Littleton.
Oh.
I, I'm, I'm not with you on that one because erm I'm sure I'm  vaguely at the back of my mind I think I know what it is, I have heard of it I mean
Mm.
or heard it
Mm.
but I can't bring it to mind, it won't come to the front  as it were.
Well I can't remember what it's called.
Erm  yes apart from My Music I can't think of one.
I heard a very amusing thing on the radio this morning
Mm?
came in half way through it, at least half way erm but it was so obviously the voice of erm  Freud, Clement Freud
Mm.
talking  and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a whole week
Mm.
and how he'd seen  prison and er they'd said they hadn't any prisons but he found one and  erm  hospitals and all that sort of thing  and at the end of the week's visit erm one of the very high ups, whom he named and I've forgotten the name of him, I think I'll just use that, thank you  erm sent for h he, he was brought before him as it were and the man said to him are there any questions er at the end of your week that you want to ask  and he said  well perhaps there is one  he said erm Winston Churchill was here erm a month or two, a few months ago
Mm.
and he also, he like me stayed in the  and he named the hotel in 
Mm.
Peking  he said can you tell me why  his room was larger than mine
Mm.
and his room had three windows erm  and I, mine only had two
Mm.
he said in spite of the fact that I've been in parliament for longer than he has, which surprised me cos I wouldn't have thought so  this is the young Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese man said to him erm oh well the reason for that was that he had a famous grandfather
and so  Clement Freud  said, not to him but now on this programme this morning, that's the first time I've ever been de-grandfathered 
That was rather nice wasn't it?
Presumably his grandfather was Sigmund Freud was it?
Yes.
Mm.
The Chinese didn't know.
No I shouldn't think the Chinese have got much time for that sort of approach to life.
I don't think they have either.
I don't think they'd have been impressed even if he'd told them 
No.
Erm  did you see that th they're, they're going to look for some sort of gene called the Churchill factor?
No.
Well they want to find out why it is that someone who smoked so much and drank  so much 
Mm!
had to live so long.
Yes.
Well it's obvious.
It's the same sort of factor that allows anybody who smokes a lot to not get cancer and not get bronchitis and live, also live a long time.
There are plenty of them.
Well that's true.
I it's just a question of, you know, something in your make-up that is inoculating you and other people have a weakness.
Well that's right.
Other people go down with it.
You can't really I should think find a gene surely that's
There must be something though Enid.
Mm there must be.
His father was a very weak man wasn't he?
Yes.
His mother was a character but   
She was not nice.
Not nice but she had a strong character.
Mm.
But his 
This reminds me
Mm?
might I just say this darling cos I've just remembered, I'll forget  senile you see?
Erm  we have a video of the last programme of the Churchill series
Mm?
erm which a friend in London very kindly made for us because we were out with her, her mother
Mm.
and couldn't see it
Mm.
and erm  Joan's video has gone wrong in some way
Really?
Yes, she doesn't know how to work it to begin with but she
was working
she was working  on that, of course we don't know a thing about it, erm  and the make, the erm  the handyman chap came along and took a part away, it was faulty 
Mm.
so we can't see it.
Do you want to come and see it on mine?
I was going, I'm getting round to that you see aren't I?
Mhm.
Erm  we feel rather badly about not returning it to this person who made it for us
Mm?
because it's now a fortnight since we had it I think
Mm.
Well come and see it on mine.
May we do that?
Mm, sure.
But when, that's not going to disturb you?
Don't know.
Erm  let's think.
Tomorrow morning?
No.
I'm taking, I'm going to London tomorrow afternoon, I
Afternoon.
I, no I've only just thought of it, I'd take it with me if, if we'd seen it.
Mm.
I've got to go out this evening.
Yes.
Well tomorrow, what happens to you tomorrow?
Is it your lazy day when you 
Yes.
Mm well we won't see it tom we'll keep it another week  keep it another week  I'll get my diary.
 

I'll get my diary, can't talk without a diary.
Okay.
We can't do it next Saturday  because erm we've got two people, a Scotsman married to a Chinese
Yes.
coming to spend Saturday.
Mm.
So that's a dead day for next week.
And  might be able to do it before the weekend perhaps 
Yeah think so, I'm just  when does Noel get back from London?
Erm hoping Monday evening.
He's going to see Mr .
He has a little bit of a scratchiness in one of his eyes
Mm?
erm and  phoned up and sort of semi made an appointment, not exactly
Mhm.
erm because Mr  was abroad  and the girl said well I mean  come in on Monday, when he'll be back
Mm.
and he may be able to see you then.
Yeah.
So  come Monday morning, Sunday night in fact, Noel said gosh I can  this is, this seems to have gone light.
We've got some ointment from the doctor which didn't work last time he put it out
Mm.
and seems to have worked this time.
So he said I can't go along and bother a busy man when it's feeling much better.
Mm.
So erm  he didn't go
Mm.
but he got a phone call on the  Tuesday from Mr  's secretary to say oh Mr  would like to see you anyway because er he feels it may have  erm  it was a letter, I'm sorry, which came
Mm.
in case it has any bearing on  any difficulty you might have in the future so  he's to go down 
So he's got an appointment?
Mm  Monday morning.
And then he's going to call at Sotherby's.
Do you know  Sotherby's are the most dilettante people you've ever come across, they really are.
Mm.
With the exception of the one  erm  section leader that he deals with normally.
At the beginning of this week a girl phoned up and said that erm  the chap he normally deals with is away
Mm.
but there's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at  and erm so he said well  send me a photograph er they've got a photograph of it you see
Mm.
send the photograph and that gives me an idea whether it's worth going to look at it at all.
That I think was about Tuesday.
Mhm.
It never came.
This is what they do, they phone up  asking  
They could have they could have even faxed it.
Mm  well we haven't got a fax.
Oh no.
But  the thing is, what they do tend to do is, they suddenly find themselves in a panic because they've behaved like this about it and the person at the other end is shouting when are you coming to see this organ
Mm.
I was talking about how dilatory S er Sotherby's are.
Oh.
Yes but I know the thing dear no 
Well of course they're not, they're not in a businesslike business are they?
No  not really, no.
And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer you come out of the upper drawer than come up with your brilliant A levels or whatever.
They do, yes.
Mm.
Exactly that.
Mm.
They are erm  a very, you know one, one of the last bastions where those sort of people can find a refuge.
Yes.
I suppose so.
I find them
You know,l like, like the Duke of Kent's daughter.
Mm.
Does she work there?
She works in art galleries or, or some art gallery 
Or some art gallery.
Yeah.
Mm.
And the man she's marrying  is an art gallery.
So he is.
That's right.
So he is.
there has to be space for these people  though somehow I always feel that they cream it all the same.
Mm I think they do cream it, yes.
 

Oh that's  
Well du during next week is what we think Noel.
Pardon?
During next week erm I'm just trying to think, I've got very heavy days on Monday and Tuesday  so
Wednesday's a possibility  then in that case.
Er let's  shall, can we leave it open?
Mhm, certainly.
And then we'll arrange it with you, mm?
Yes.
Erm I don't know whether  I think  post rather erm er I see I'm not going to London after  erm after this week  
Ooh.
 
Oh you're going to be making some of your special coffee are you love?
I am indeed.
Ooh er 
How's your barn proceeding?
Don't know, it doesn't seem to be doing anything and what the  was that during the week when  was in residence  one night the dogs barked and he went out to see what was happening and there was a young man who worked in it  this was in the pitch dark, was up there taking some of his stuff away.
Oh.
Oh.
So I wonder.
Has he run out of cash?
Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
Why would he need to do it in the dark?
Well if for instance it's approaching receivership 
Oh oh oh
you'd want to sort of, you know
Mm.
Oh yes.
get your stuff and you'd want it not to be obvious that you'd got your stuff.
Oh I see, yes.
But that's, that's only a guess though 
 
I don't know.
you mean the young man who actually owns it or the man who's employed working on it?
Well  I don't know who exactly owns it
Yes.
but the man who has been doing the work there who said he owned it
Oh I know, oh.
But the, the  lady who was erm  what's her name daughter, she used to live in the   erm  erm live in the terraced house  erm 
What Jo ?
Mrs what?
you mean?
No er the people before them.
The ?
What?
The ?
yes, Ann  's daughter
Mhm.
who's got the farm up at 
Mhm.
and there's a  there's a farm for sale opposite there, you never saw such a wreck in all your life.
Oh it is a wreck.
Yes.
Yes it really is.
Yes.
I think the vogue is dying isn't it?
Yes.
Erm  they're being much stricter about what you can do to them.
Erm.
And how you do it perhaps.
And how you do it and everything, yes.
I think that erm  across the road from me he's just mucked around.
Yes.
He hasn't done things in the sort of, you know, the preferred way.
That was the sign from the beginning wasn't it?
Yes.
And he hasn't had  building inspections at the right sorts of times.
Ah.
So I think he's going to find himself in a lot of trouble.
That's good.
Mm.
Well he didn't, he did deserve it didn't he, really?
Yep.
But he paid dearly for it in the first place didn't he?
I think it's such a shame that he's gone and put that wretched wirenetting fence so close to the road
I agree.
across the road from me.
That what?
Wirenetting fence across the road.
Yes  it is wretched.
Cos it's so close to the road, it doesn't give me any swinging round room
Well actually if he's  
on my side of the road.
If he's having problems
Mm?
you may be able to get that rectified mayn't you?
Ya.
And say yes 
Better arrange for the coal lorr lorry to back in to it one day.
Ya I was I've been thinking of trying to have a big delivery of something.
I mean I would do you er have ?
I don't have any coal delivered unfortunately.
Oh.
I've go I've got some coal in the coal shed and it, you know,i it sort of lasts me.
Oh.
I never seem to run out.
Because if you had old er  what's his name?
Don .
Don , 's man  er if you explained the bother
Mhm.
er he would back his  with a little encouragement from me he'd back his lorry right into it and  flatten it for you.
Darling he's a very  nice man.
I know he is, that's why he'd do it.
Well unfortunately if, if I did have a delivery of coal it would come in through the other entrance.
Oh  that needn't prevent you from  backing in er backing into it when he turns round.
No it's been, it's been a tough week this last week.
Oh dear.
I'm sorry.
I feel very sorry for people who have to work for their living now, I really do.
Mm.
Yes.
Oh we've got something else have we?
I thought  
Yes we've got a little bit of Israel haven't you?
A bit of Israel?
Yes.
We had a  box of oranges sent to us from Israel
Oh I see
direct to me
Mm.
friends of ours there.
Actually it's George  's son.
Mhm.
My wife's  
Hello Ian, oh I was hoping that you'd come and see us.
Yes.
That's wonderful.
to see you.
I'm just getting, will you  tea?
Yes, I'd love one.
Thank you.
Right I'll just get that.
Well how are things going?
Yes business okay 
 
Mm  no 
No?
Oh dear dear dear
not at all, no.
Is old  alright?
Just about yes  yes.
That must be worrying, a lot of people feel like that don't they?
Yes.
No it's, it's been a very bad eighteen months er 
Oh dear.
cos the, the business that I was
What?
the business I was a director of
Yes?
er last year  went into receivership
Oh lord.
in January
Ooh.
Now does that have a er I, I know you lose the income but  does it, does it penalize you at all?
Yes it does.
Oh dear.
Yes.
Yeah we've had er  the D T I investigating
Oh lord.
cos it was quite a big company.
Oh.
But erm  it just er hopefully because yeah but really they're just trying to investigate to make sure that we didn't act fraudulently in any way.
Oh yes.
Oh good.
I mean I don't suppose 
Which, which we didn't.
You know it was the 
 
it was the downturn that erm
Yes, ooh 
you know that started nineteen  nineteen ninety one.
What was the business what er did you do?
In, in advertising.
Advertising oh yes.
An advertising agency.
Oh.
Yeah.
But about  a third of the top agencies in our sector all went bust in 
Good god.
in the last eighteen months.
Cos living up here privately in retirement one doesn't realize these things.
I mean er unemployment in er  white collar management  area is, is, is very marked now.
Is it?
Yeah it's  yes.
Yes it's really affect affected our, our businesses.
There's so many areas that have contracted so much.
Yes and i it's a, it's  long erm 
It is, yes.
process  
Yes.
Affects everything.
But, you know, things are going okay.
But you, you managing just, just to hold on  
Just about yes.
Yeah.
Cos as you know Ben's in Hong Kong
Yes?yes.
He's suddenly swapping from the police to er security in  a big bank.
Oh fascinating.
Oh.
Erm I, I suppose it'll be a couple of years before he does that but  
Well, yes.
yes.
Cos he signed up for five, five years didn't he?
He signed up for three years with an option 
Mm 
to do another two.
Oh I see, yes.
And I think he's going to work out the other two and then go on to this  forget the name of it at the moment, this bank
Mm.
and er but he doesn't want to come back to England.
 

No I was sorry I missed him when he came over last year.
Last year, yes.
I just had a quick phonecall with him.
Oh he did speak to you?
Yes.
Yes that's right mm 
Yes.
Yes see that time went like lightning.
Yes.
Such a shame.
Edmund is still in his job.
Aha.
He still hasn't got naturalization but he seems to be fairly  erm fairly secure.
He's a journalist of course.
Yes.
Is he confident that he'll get the naturalization?
Oh yes, eventually he will.
Right.
Yes.
W will that be this year or does it take much longer?
You can never tell
Really?
never tell, a  girl we know went over at the same time as he did  got it this year.
Really?
But er it's just the luck of the draw, it all depends upon the temper of the particular official that's handling it I think.
Yes.
I'll give you a  funny article he wrote before you go.
Oh I'd like to see that.
But er  I'm just trying to think now er  Ben  er the trouble with it is, Edmund can't leave the country  whilst he's in a job  until he gets naturalization because he's got to get a work permit and an entry permit and everything all the way through
Right.
and  again er with the present state of unemployment in America it's unlikely he would get it.
It's very difficult.
Yes.
But he, he managed to  get his extension to his permit because he had these English connections and the paper he was on  reckoned that he was very valuable to them and so they
Good.
they held him.
Good.
Well I'm sure he's 
Are your wife and family well?
Yes.
They're happy with you are they?
Yes they are, yes.
I wouldn't er  bestow them er on you even for a short visit though.
Oh don't be silly.
The er the s the small one is er
Oh you've got two have you?
Yes  he's a real handful.
Is he?
Oh dear dear 
Yes.
dear dear.
Yeah he's er he's nearly two and it's a  er they're trying times.
I've had it five times.
Yes.
We're expecting another one in June.
Are you really?
You  
That'll be that'll be the third.
But I had five.
Every 
Yes.
one I said was the last but it .
Oh I see certainly feel that er we must be mad.
We must be mad.
And you're living in Chiswick?
Yes, yes.
Although we'll have to sell that house.
Would you?
What because of the financial position?
Yes.
Oh dear oh dear
So er we'll have to wait  we're, we're  er we've put an offer in, in on a house in Weybridge
Oh yes?
in Surrey.
Erm  not particularly because we, we wanted to go to Weybridge but er
Cos travelling's expensive isn't it?
It is actually.
Fifteen hundred pounds
for twenty five minutes' journey to Waterloo.
But it's got a huge garden which with the two boys I think will be marvellous.
Oh yes.
It's very unusual for a  even in a, a suburban er
Yes.
area.
Huge garden.
I know Weybridge slightly.
Do you?
Oh.
Mm.
Erm  but will you make, be able to make much profit on the  on your old Chiswick house to be able to buy the Weybridge one, will that be an economic move?
Erm  we save quite a lot er which is what we're trying to do, yes.
Oh good, yes.
Erm  and it's er it's a good area for schools
It is a good area for schools, mm.
a a and er it's you know a reasonable community 
As a matter of fact I knew an old couple that ran a, had a nursery school there, a big one and a very successful one.
Yes I imagine it, it would be.
For a number of years they did have but er
It's a shame about le leaving  Hounslow where Chiswick is
Yes.
because they provide nursery places.
And 
Yes.
so Thomas who's three is at school.
Oh yes.
Whereas Surrey doesn't until they're five.
Oh dear.
So we'll have to put them
Even if they don't you can sometimes find that  if you get behind the scenes that there is a way of doing it.
Yes.
Yes.
Got to spin a hard luck story, something of that sort.
Yeah.
Yes.
But erm  we're very lucky where we are.
The state schools are very good.
Are they, in Chiswick?
They do seem very good.
Very pleased with them.
But erm it's difficult living in London now.
The erm  you really are aware, I don't know if you get up to London much?
Do occasionally, yes.
Yes but the erm  the atmosphere
Oh I hate London, it's awful.
Chris Christmas day  I had a real chest erm  and mouth and everything.
I can quite believe it.
And it's erm it's so oppressive and we really worry about it with the children.
Yes well I can see that, mm.
I er I very much dislike London.
We've got, still got a little house there
Yes.
and er so it gets sort of 
At the organ works?
Yes.
Yeah.
It's a bolt hole
Mhm.
but I very seldom use it.
Yes.
How, how's the er organ business going?
They're up to their eyes in work.
Plenty of 
Really?
of work.
Mm.
Good.
Lot of it export.
Good.
Ian do you have milk in your tea?
Just milk, that'll be 
Just 
lovely.
yes right.
Yes.
No sugar?
No thank you.
Oh good lad.
Oh yes John s came back from Japan
Really?
They, he built a large organ  university of  or  
Yes, yes.
And er  he was back there ten days ago for some or other to see another customer  and when he came, only got back into the country on Monday or Tuesday
Aha.
beginning of this week  and then today I've had a letter from an architect friend in America suggesting he gets in touch with an architect in  for another job  
Yes, yes.
I'm taking it down to him tomorrow.
But he's  he's got work in there to come.
He's going to build a new organ for Chelmsford cathedral.
Oh that's good 
A new one for St John's College Cambridge, he's really quite busy.
Good.
Good well I'm pleased that er business is strong.
Oh yes he's alright.
Yes.
Well Ian and how are you doing?
Oh not too bad.
Keeping fit 
Really?
anyway.
Yes.
You're keeping fit?
That's good.
He said he didn't bring the children because he thought that we were too old for them.
I think we're, I'm too old for my children, well the smallest one.
How lovely.
Harry is a  a nightmare.
He's a real 
Is he?
handful.
Yes.
He's a handful is he?
Oh dear.
I'm just going to pour you a
Right.
I w I was letting it 
Thank you.
er brew a little bit just to 
Yes that's fine
for you.
You're looking very fit anyway.
Oh that's kind of you.
Well we keep busy don't we darling?
Ya.
And erm  we just love it here of course 
Mm.
so we've got nothing to grumble about at all really.
Ian was saying how 
Good.
he's moving out of London t to Weybridge or hoping to.
Hoping to.
You are?
Yes.
Oh are you?
Yeah.
That'll be nice.
I, I think so.
Yes.
It's not  it's not out of choice entirely because er  the business that I was has, has gone very very badly over the last eighteen months
Do you mean that type of business or that particular firm?
Both.
Oh.
Yeah.
But the particular firm I was a director of went into receivership
Oh dear.
beginning of last year, it was about 
Oh that's  
a year ago now and erm  so er I mean fortunately it was bought er as a going concern
Good.
erm but everyone's financial position er suffered as a result.
Yes.
Mm.
So I'm not as, on as good a contract.
You're not?
No.
No.
But them I'm lucky to have  have a job really.
Well  I mean these were the kind of jobs that weren't replaceable weren't they really?
Well 
In a slump.
yes that's it.
I mean there's so little business around that erm
That's right.
so
It was, it was  somewhat a good thing that somebody was prepared to buy it.
Yeah.
Now I'll pull this forward a bit erm  Ian 
Sorry is this your seat?
and  no it isn't, no no no, not at all.
Now I'm going to leave those there
Yes.
Alright 
and you'll just dive in to those won't you?
Oh lovely thank you.
That's the thing.
I'm going to sit quite near to you because I can hear better when I do.
Right.
So.
Erm so this means that the house  that you were so  er happy with and have you continued to be happy with it?
Yes.
Erm in er forgotten  
In Chiswick.
In Chiswick
Yes.
that's right.
Aha.
So you've got to leave that now?
Yes.
Yes.
Mm 
But 
Well this is life when you're young.
i i it is really.
Yeah I mean we we're  fatalistic about it, it's  I, I think it is only a, a phase.
Yes.
Things will change.
Yes.
I'm sure we've learnt er I've learnt er  business er  er secures as a result of it
Yes.
erm so  positive about it.
Yes.
It's the only way to be really isn't it?
Well yeah yes.
Have you got a house ready for you in erm Weybridge?
Well we're buying it from an ol elderly chap
Mm.
erm he's been in it twenty years  and er he's had it on the market for some time.
It m probably not as long as a year but it's quite a while
Mm.
er and he's accepted our offer
Good.
but he doesn't seem actually willing to move out
Oh 
er which I can understand really.
You, one gets very fond of a house really.
I think he's he's split up with his wife
Oh.
although he must be sixty odd erm  and it's obviously a very difficult time for him.
Yes.
Erm so he's keeping us in limbo really
Yes.
which is a bit infuriating cos er Alison's due our third in   
My!
at the end of June 
Oh.
so er we have to be decided either way
yes.
by then.
Yes.
Oh we're quite happy to rent for a while.
I was going to say that's the alternative I suppose 
Yes, yes 
to, yes.
yes
And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something 
Yes 
until he decides 
Can you get 
yes.
places to rent alright?
Yes you can actually, yes.
Yes.
Mm yes, do help yourself Ian.
Erm so  where would he be meaning to go if he does let you 
He wants to move down to a smaller house in Weybridge.
Yes.
Er which we're told shouldn't be difficult to find.
Er no no.
So erm, you know, hopefully that will be the case.
Mm.
But erm  I don't think he er realizes how difficult it is
No.
to set up
No.
a move and that really he's quite fortunate to have a buyer  somewhere within the price he wanted.
Indeed.
Cos we've all  you know, we've all not got as much for our houses as we want
No that's very true.
That's true.
 

Mm.
Oh well let's hope that he will.
I mean the thing is  at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period.
Mm.
Well, you know, he hasn't bought a hou sold a house within the last ten years
Mhm mm
which we've done a number of times
Yes.
and it's not a pleasant  it's a very stressful business.
I'm sure I'm sure it is.
I don't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see.
Because we lived on the business, that was
Mm.
er a foregone conclusion and we never  sought to move from there until he retired did we?
Mm.
No.
So one doesn't know er exactly what it's like to do it.
No.
No.
Mm.
Gosh.
And tell us about the children, how old are they?
Harry is erm he'll be two in June
Mhm.
then Thomas will be four in August.
Oh I see, so they're nice spaces.
Yes there'll be two years between all of them.
Yes.
Yes.
So which Alison feels is erm  er you know the right sort of time 
Ideal really.
for her
Yes.
which is obviously important.
Yes.
And erm they haven't had  Thomas doesn't remember not having Harry around
That's nice.
whereas we've got friends who've got older children  well a little bit there's, yeah, three or four years between
Mm.
and they get er old enough to be er quite er happy that they're on  you know,c centre of attention
Exactly.
which er Thomas hasn't.
It sours the relationship a bit.
Yeah it does a bit.
Yes aha.
Mm.
Ah well I  I  is this going to be, if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin?
I don't know actually.
could be.
you've got two boys
Mhm.
and so 
the last of the tribe.
Oh the last of the tribe.
Yes.
 
Well I think I think you know what I mean.
Mm.
Erm that's what we did finally in desperation with Ben wasn't it?
You decided to 
He was five, number five .
Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now wouldn't it 
Mm 
really?
I'd, it's funny because I always wanted a girl
Mm.
but now I, I wouldn't know, I don't feel  I'd know what to do 
Mm well  this is just how Ruth was.
Yes  
got no choice.
Mm.
No that's right.
This is what Ruth er felt cos she had two boys
Mm.
but erm and she thought I shan't know how to deal with a girl at all 
Mhm.
which is a funny thing for a woman to think isn't it?
Well Alison feels the same, yes 
Does she?
Yes, yes she does.
Yeah.
It is odd isn't it?
But 
And then she had
Oh, oh she adores her, and of course she said it's wonderful, I don't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers.
Yes.
This of course is passing now because the girl's 
Yes.
four isn't she Noel?
Four and 
Really?
Gosh 
she'll be five in April and that's the youngest one.
Oh.
And er, oh here they are
Mm.
and er she said it was lovely to be able to put her in dresses.
Mm.
That's the first day at school 
Oh lovely.
for Catherine.
Mhm.
She, they all go to the same school.
Oh lovely.
That's nice isn't it?
children, yes it's great.
Mm.
So Ruth I think as far as, barring accidents, will regard that as being her final  
Right.
They live in Wells
Oh do they?
in Somerset.
Mm.
Yes.
Oh lovely.
I don't know that area but 
And they no  they're very happy  there .
So  that's them.
And I gather John's doing well.
Yes John is doing well, he's got three children too.
He's ooh
Yes and his are 
lots 
the other way round
Aha.
erm a boy first and then two girls.
Well he's got three too.
Nice kids.
Yes.
Mm yes nice kids.
Mm.
And of course Margaret's not erm inclined for marriage, she loves her job.
No, yeah.
And erm I think she'll be  she'll, she'll probably stay single unless 
Mhm 
she meets some nice old man.
Yeah.
Wh and where's Margaret working?
She's now at erm one of the girls public day school  trust schools in Sydenham.
Oh.
Sydenham High School.
Mm.
Sydenham High School  For Girls.
Her dream really is to be teaching at City of London School  
Mm.
And erm I'm ho we're hoping that she might
Mm.
get a job there.
But she loves her work doesn't she Noel?
 
Very secure.
And she 
And your mother seems keeping quite well.
Yes, yes she is.
She had a bad er  flu over Christmas
when she was due to come  and she's still got a very bad chest
Mm.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that, oh.
but er
That's the bit that hangs on always 
Yes.
isn't it?
Mm.
Yes I saw her, I went up to I went to  keep fit with her
Oh you did?
Good.
and er
Good.
although I didn't last  Tuesday, I did the Tuesday before and she seemed 
Mhm 
to be getting back on her feet alright.
Mm.
Ah
She says she's much better  
Mm.
And what about Hamish?
Mhm.
Doing fine?
Mm.
Finding it quite difficult to get work but erm he was over at Christmas for a short time.
Oh yes.
I don't think 
And I saw him 
we saw him did we?
No.
Well he wasn't here very long
No.
but er they've got, they've se set up their own teaching business
Oh, have they?
and again because of the recession over there le learning English is, is one of the things that, you know, gets put, put back on the 
It's not a priority.
priority yes.
Mm.
Mm.
So erm  but they se they seem to be working out okay.
Mm.
They've taken somebody else on so things can't be that bad 
Have they?
Yeah.
Oh good.
Mhm.
er Alec is a re another real handful.
Is he?
He's a year younger than Thomas but he was  the same height
Mm.
and er sort of wild curly hair and 
Oh really?
Yes.
real wild 
Isn't that funny?
but lovely, lovely boy yeah.
Yes, yes but, but lively.
Yes.
Mm.
Very much so.
Is that the only child they have at the present time?
Yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
All they can cope with I think.
And of course he'll be bilingual.
Well he is.
Mm.
He's quite slow as a result, which is quite common apparently
Is it?
with er  children who are brought up with both languages.
Mm.
Mm.
Erm  bec they don't speak either very well to start off with.
And how old is he did you say?
He's two and a half  
Oh well it's early.
It's such an advantage to them later on I think.
Oh well a absolutely yes.
Mm.
Er he  because Toni, Hamish's wife
Mm
is half French  so 
Is she?
I'm, I'm sure he'll her pick up 
Get three.
Trilingual.
Yes.
Cos they spend quite a lot of time, they spend their holidays in France.
Yes.
So I'm sure that confuses him even more at this stage.
Mm.
Course it does.
Yeah.
Yes but in the end it does seem to work.
I was always  a bit doubtful about it
Mm.
erm er you know, whether it could vu confuse children or not but in fact it doesn't seem to with John's children does it?
No no.
His 
They use 
his wife is German.
Yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
And they use both languages quite freely.
Mm.
In fact she gets rather  uptight because erm  during the year at school when they're speaking English most of the time
Yes.
which is very natural, and so she ships them off to Germany to the relatives
To put them straight.
Aye  
 
That's quite right I think because it is a good, good thing.
That's right.
Well it is.
I wo I won't thanks.
Will you have another one?
No thank you.
Well help yourself then if you want one.
Mm.
But 
Yes.
of course the, the, the slump is also, not the slump, the recession is also er operative in Italy is it?
Yes.
It's everywhere.
Ian why do people 
It's worldwide.
Well
make such a fuss about it erm I mean politically?
Well, yes well I suppose it's 
Everybody's having to cope with it.
coming up to an election time and 
Of course.
everyone er
They're bound to use it.
bound to use anything they can
Mm.
er any angle they can get, get a grip of.
Yes.
But er  yes, no it is  th I mean they had a lot of business from banks and areas like that  
Yes.
which of course have lost a lot of money in the last year or two.
That's right of course.
They have, they will be drawing back on most things.
Yeah.
But in fact  they're the people aren't they who need bilingual people on the staff?
Yes they are.
They're much, much better.
I mean y er  you know, although they're in recession I, I think there's  you know in this country
Mm.
we we're owned now, our company, by a French agency group  and erm  none of our directors are, are learning French.
Isn't it extraordinary.
And yet you've got  people who run restaurants, small businesses of that sort erm  just general businessmen who want, you know, know they have to speak English.
Mm.
And they're just doing it as a matter of course over there.
Yes.
They all seem to have more drive than our people, what's the matter with us?
It's certainly in the, in that area, it's the cosmopolitan business
Mm.
attitude er  and also it's complacency because we can 
Yes.
you can get away with it.
You know all the meetings 
That's right.
are held in English.
Mm.
Mm.
And er the French speak very good English
Mm.
erm so there's, there's not enough incentive there.
No.
And I have to say that er I don't.
But I, I, I  I ou really I, I know I'll have to be thrown into the situation of having to do it
You'd better get on with it and do it now.
Yes.
But of course the beauty of it is you've done it at school haven't you?
Yes.
And once you've done it at school, it comes back with a bit of an effort quite quickly.
Yeah I've got a reasonable vocabulary
Yes.
Yes.
but never really spoken it at all.
I mean we never did any French trips.
Didn't you?
was useless for languages when I was there.
Was it?
Yes absolutely hopeless.
We never did any  trips of that nature at all actually.
And what was the teaching system?
Er had they  by the time you were still at school  come on to that new erm  er system where you speak a lot more?
No.
No.
You've done it out of grammar books?
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
I remember 
Mm.
it was, yeah vocabulary tests and that sort of thing which 
Mm.
Mm.
you know er well it's er it's a middle ages approach to  
Well actually the one thing you can say about it is, it is a good grounding for what you now go on and do
Mm.
because erm wherever you go now for  refresher lessons, they will use the modern method.
Yeah.
And that's, that will build on that foundation.
Yes.
You'll be astonished how quickly it'll come back.
Mm mm.
You really will.
Hopefully.
Mm.
Yes all we had when I was at school were l l yards of verbs and yards of nouns, we never knew how to put the two lots together.
No.
   
That's true.
Yeah.
Mm.
The people who had the imagination or ability to do it where the ones that could speak the languages, the ones that didn't
Yes it was 
made no connection at all.
Mm.
Because I knew a lot of nouns and a lot of verbs, I could get by when I went to Algeria in 
Mm.
nineteen forty  but it was  I envied those who could really speak.
Yeah.
Mm.
But erm  if you see some officer floundering for  the word for a cabbage or something of that sort I could provide the word and he provided the conversation.
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
Well actually  you're going to a centre aren't you er in  where there will be evening classes and that sort of opportunity?
Yes.
I think probably 
It's, it's it's well erm  served for  for  
Mm I would imagine it's quite well led.
Mm.
Ya.
And you'll have no problem, yes.
Mm.
Aha.
I'll have to give up my art classes then which is 
Art?
haven't been doing them recently but when I've been able to get a, er an evening away that's what I 
Mm mm.
spend my time doing  over the past few years.
Yes but will it rule it out altogether do you think if you've got to do the French?
Well A Alison goes out for one evening so that means I have to get back early for that evening
Mm.
and then if I, I go out for another one, that means two evening evenings back
Yes.
leaving the office at  five thirty on the dot and of course 
Yes.
I, I can't do that more than twice a week.
No.
No I see.
Your work itself is going to take more time than that.
Well yes.
Is that just at first or is it  regularly?
No I mean it's, it's always been the case.
Mm.
Mm.
Ya.
Mm.
It's tough really.
It is tough.
It's very erratic the work as well, it's it's 
Yes, is it?
very, you know, stop start  
Yes.
Is it still advertising?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
You must be pretty good at that by now.
Well I've got quite a lot of experience  I mean I've 
Yes you have.
I've done it since I was, well it's getting on for fifteen years now.
It isn't?
Yeah, thirteen years in, in 
Mm.
the same area
Mm.
I've not really moved around a lot
No.
No.
in the actual function.
No.
Just sort of progressed up the ladder I suppose 
Yes.
Mhm.
so, yes 
Yes.
Oh well, you can only make the best of the thing you've got and that's the best thing to do rather than 
Mm.
unless you're forced to switch er horses, you know in, in mid stream.
Yeah.
Well i i I always say that er it always comes a surprise that I was good at anything.
And I always think back to the er the time I think Edmund and I were sitting in the back garden here  and deciding that we'd go off and join the paratroopers
 
Really?
because we weren't going to get  any O levels.
Oh!
And that was  about all we were good for .
I'm sorry.
 
How funny.
But in fact you did get your O levels didn't you?
So I remember  well I got a handful 
Yes I remember 
 
Mm.
And Edmund got a B A.
Yeah.
Ah but wait a minute, not until after that was it?
yes.
He got his O levels but that was it.
Yes.
Decided  he'd had enough and I suppose you had too.
Mm well
Did you stay on for As?
Yes I did.
Mm.
But again I  you know I always had the ability to er to know, to scrape by
Yes.
or knowing what the minimum required was
and er pitching myself at just over that point I think.
Yes.
Which I suppose is some sort of  ability   
Well it's a it's a, in a way that's quite true.
Mm.
Yes it saves the er er the use of excess energy when you don't need to doesn't it?
Yes.
That's right.
Ah.
Edmund was lucky because he got this chance to do  a university you see in 
Mm.
in er New Hampshire wasn't it?
Yes.
Erm 
Well that's when er Ben and I saw him, when he was doing it
That's right, you did.
doing that, yes.
You did.
Yeah.
But I'd love to see him again.
Oh yes.
I'd love to get a trip out there.
It would be wonderful wouldn't it?
Yes.
He'd so love to see people and of course at the moment
Mm.
he daren't make trips, or at least it wouldn't be wise to make trips yet 
I know, yes I know  
because he's waiting for his
Yes, naturalization.
Shame really.
Yes.
That's right.
Can I pour you another cup of tea Ian?
I'm fine actually, thank you.
We've got photographs, recent ones, to show you anyway.
Oh good.
And we saw him in  September October didn't we?
Yes  yes  
End of September beginning of October 
Good.
and stayed
they had a barn just a little way from the house, you could see it but it 
Right.
wasn't very striking 
It was 
No it was, it was just grey and, and, and 
Yes.
quite unobtrusive.
Well they've had a marvellous sort of conversion of that done
Mm.
for guests and erm 
Because they had a beautiful house anyway didn't they?
Oh a beautiful house
Mm.
yes and they're still in the same house.
They they're 
Yes.
very fond of it.
And erm  so now when we go they're awfully sweet and they bring Edmund at the same time
Oh right.
and we all three, Noel and Edmund and I, live in this barn.
Oh that's lovely.
ideal.
Which is marvellous.
for breakfast.
George did that, really, so that when his grandchildren came he hadn't got them under his feet.
No, it's a good idea.
And he, well he's, he was wealthy enough to do exactly as he wanted.
Yes.
Yeah.
It sounds ideal.
It's lovely.
Yeah.
It's very lovely.
They're such nice people.
Yeah.
And of course they 
I didn't meet him.
Oh didn't you?
No I only met erm Ellie 
Ellie.
very briefly as well.
Well it was summer, wasn't it?
Yes  er no it was April.
Oh.
April and the son 
And had they gone away then?
the son was there.
Dan.
Dan was around and the other, the, the younger one.
Oh John.
I c I don't remember his name.
Er John was the youngest.
Yes I think it was him.
Mike wouldn't be, I think he was w er getting on a bit, oh I don't know
Dan lived in town 
Mike was at university.
Yes
er and the, the son, I think he was at college himself
That's right.
and he was sort of back and forwards but he was based 
That's right.
in the house.
Yes.
That was John.
yes.
Mike was down at er Providence.
He was in university.
They're all married, those boys now.
Are they?
Yes.
Dan is 
Good.
married.
Without any children 
I remember Dan but I  
oh yes Dan's a dear boy.
Yes.
And er we're very fond of them all.
Mm.
And erm of course er it's just like second home to Edmund.
They are so good to him.
Yes.
I must say it's, it  must be good to have somebody like that er 
Absolutely.
o over there cos it, it must be  must have felt quite isolated  
Yes.
Oh he would if he hadn't got them 
Yes.
certainly.
Yes.
I mean it's lovely because he  er he adores to get into  does Edmund and that means that he and George go about this lovely big er  grounds that they've 
Yes.
got  and Edmund does lots of grass cutting and er
tree cutting and
all manner of things with 
Mm.
George.
They've got a great com a great relationship going.
Good.
Good.
And of course he spends Christmas.
let me see, Dan is the same age as John isn't he?
As Ben, no  Edmund isn't he?
Erm
I think he's a bit older.
he's older.
Oh.
Yes 
He's younger than John 
cos Edmund and I are the same age 
Oh.
Are you thirty f 
Thirty four.
four now?
Yes.
That's right.
Well I should think Dan might be 
Couple of years older?
Not as much as that.
oh.
Well 
before they were married.
Really?
Yes.
Gosh.
Yes Dan must be  I would have thought it's only months probably, but it might be quite a few months.
Mm.
Mm I don't think it's more because we soon had, started having our children didn't we?
Mm.
Erm  ooh wait a minute we're saying, we're saying than Edmund aren't we?
Yes mm.
Of course, I'm stupid.
He was the eldest of their children.
Dan was?
Dan was.
Yes.
Oh right.
Yes.
Ya.
So I'm v I'm a bit vague about it, you may well be right and it's two years
Mm.
because of course we've got older children than Edmund.
That would line him up with Edmund though wouldn't it?
No
Yes 
No 
no  
no, a couple of years you're quite right.
Mm?
Couple of years older I should think.
Yeah.
That's it.
But erm oh they're a great family they really are but I think George and J Joy's having Edmund because although Dan lives in the town er what's it called, New Haven?
Yes.
Erm obviously he's got his own business, he's got a shop now, an outfitter's shop.
Yes 
Did he have it that time?
He had something like that.
He was so vague though.
I mean 
I know 
he was delightfully vague
 
Oh  he's an absolutely 
but I was never really sure  what he was doing .
No 
Er yes I  I thought he had a shop, maybe yes   
That's er he worked in a shop  probably at that time.
Yes I think so yes.
That's it, he worked in that er fancy goods shop 
 
That's right.
nine years ago
Visitors shop.
that we went.
Sorry?
I think it was nine years ago.
Was it?
Yes.
Yes.
It doesn't seem possible really does it?
The year before I married.
Eighty five.
Good heavens.
Was it really?
Is that no, no eighty five that  no eighty three, that's right, yes, nine years.
Was it?
Mm.
Yes.
Oh well that was a great thing for you really wasn't it?
You must have enjoyed it.
Oh it was a marvellous trip.
Splendid.
Was it?
Absolutely yeah.
Mm.
Really very good.
Mm.
I enjoyed travelling with Ben a lot.
Yes.
He's a very good er companion.
Yes he was a good travelling companion I should 
Yes.
imagine.
Yes.
Yes.
He of course is 
Ben's been all over the world since then  
Well yes.
I know.
I'm most envious of him I am.
And do you sometimes get any word from him?
Very rarely.
Mm well so do we.
 
Rarely.
Yes.
I must write to him myself actually.
Have you got his latest address?
I haven't, no.
I'd better give it to you because he has 
Right.
changed it.
I did bring my address book with me.
I'll go and I'll go and get it for you and do make yourself another tea  
Oh righto I'll just, excuse me a minute I'm  
Yes of course 
You sit down, that's alright.
Right.
Oh yes.
Oh I see.
the day before he left.
Mm.
Is this on the sort of  or something?
Ah it's pretty, yes   it's that sort of place   
Have you been to Hong Kong ?
I haven't been to Hong Kong to see Ben
Mhm.
because, but I did go to Hong Kong when I went to China.
Oh you went to China, that's right, yeah.
That's right for three weeks and erm  then I wasn't impressed by it, I was much more interested in China.
Yes.
But I would, in a way, love to go whilst he's there but he  er he really feels that it wouldn't be a place that would suit pa and me on holiday.
Mm.
So 
I've heard that before.
What love?
Other people  it's a noisy place.
It isn't it isn't nice but for the young 
Well Enid's been there I haven't.
Mm.
It's nice for the young I think.
As far as I've been is the airport.
Mm.
Now can you see Edmund's cos he changed  
 
You see it's a terrible erm
Well I'll go and get it, I've got it written down there in my place.
Well it's here darling
but it's just a question of finding it, it's
right.
Just go through, you'll find it certainly.
Is it
that's it, is it ?
That's it.
Oh 
That's it, that's it.
Well that's lovely.
I'm going to get one of those articles that Ben wr Edmund wrote.
Oh yes, yes he'll enjoy that.
I've got no excuse now.
No.
Who's going to sit down?
That's right sit there.
I expect si , don't know how Len's gotta sit down or whether he's gotta stand.
I'm gonna stand.
Are you happier standing?
Yes it's his
That's alright .
his back.
Belinda  if we can start with you more or less  erm  I heard the other day that you're  half thinking that you might like to be  a nurse?
Yeah, that's it.
That's right.
Mhm.
Can you speak up a bit.
Speak up a bit Belinda!
What erm  what sort of nurse are you thinking about?
Nursery nurse, looking after young children in nurseries and stuff like that.
Mhm.
I can imagine you doing that.
Can you?
Aha.
Mhm.
I can.
Yes.
I'm going, for work experience I'm going to  Saxted Ministry up there hopefully  to see what it's like looking after children  you know, like a nursery and everything.
So hopefully I can get the job there  from that two weeks, and then  
That would be wonderful!
what it's like.
Yeah.
I didn't 
Yes.
know there was one at  Saxted 
Yeah, it's called Rainbow.
I think, isn't it?
Yeah.
Oh that's right, yes.
And is that for children who are  living there or just go in for the day?
Just go in for the day till their parents go to work I think.
Mhm,
Oh Good!
I think it's something like that, yeah.
Aha.
And what qualifications mus must you have for that?
Erm, I don't really know at the moment, I gotta look up and see what it needs, like  and things   to do  and study, things like that.
Mhm.
Mm.
Mhm.
Good!
So probably  GCSE
Right.
Mhm.
It's all to do with GCSE coursework and  see how we're getting on  during the two weeks and  we get experience for us when we leave school and go to work.
That's a good idea!
Yeah.
You get a feeling for it then.
Yeah.
I think it's one of the best jobs for a girl that there are don't you?
Well I think so, I think  erm  as long as they can go and work with children  and then  they've got the time when they can leave off and come, but it's having the whole time, well then they've children all their life haven't they?
Yes.
This is the only thing if  you go sort of privately  you know?
Yes.
You can fe start of with children and you are finishing up with children!
Well that  well tha wo would tha would you not think that's a good thing?
Erm
I mean, for instance, if you do the  the very high grade Norlands nanny training  they go on till they're  grey and  experienced it all 
Like me !
haven't they?
Well, you know i don't they?
Well 
Yeah.
would you feel you'd not want to do it all that time then Belinda?
I don't really know  actually, it's always 
Can't yet.
the time, no.
That's true.
I don't know but,that far ahead, you know.
Just a good experience for her  for time, you know.
Indeed!
But I shouldn't want her do it all her life!
You wouldn't?
No.
It's a very well paid job!
Oh yes, I know!
What about that, but I meant she gotta think about, she'll want children of own  and then she'll have chi 
Yes.
Aren't you?
Aye Liddy?
Oh yes!
But then 
 
don't you think that it's a, it's a marvellous training for her?
That's what I say, it's a training, nice 
Yes.
training for them, then say after about three or four year  if they wanna get married, they got children and they got  some good experience.
Absolutely!
Mm.
It's invaluable.
Yes.
That can't be the kind of thing you're thinking of then?
 
What do you want, what do you have er, in mind?
I'd like to go into the farmer business.
Would you?
Yeah, erm  mixed farm with animals and sort of, cereal crops, stuff like that.
Good!
Well you're in the right place for that.
Yeah.
Would you got to an agricultural college?
Yeah, I'm hoping to go  Ockleigh whe why am I, get older.
Sort of erm  working on a farm for two days then going to the college  erm  that, so I do it like that.
Mm.
It's a good place, Ockleigh 
Yeah.
Splendid!
And then, would you like to work in this area or would you like to go  elsewhere?
I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about it, it's erm  it all depends on what farm I'm going on cos I've  or erm  cows an , cows and bullocks, you know.
Mm.
Mm.
And you won't have worked on a farm at all yet, will you?
No.
Not yet.

They got ponies haven't they
Yeah and 
Mm mm.
these two erm, sort of mucking about  .
You think you'd quite like to be with animals would you?

Yeah, what I mean, all round agricultural work and on your ?
Yeah.
Is that it?
Well 
Mm.

We've been gardening this morning.
I was looking at the garden as I came in, I thought I might have, even though I didn't know the number
Yeah.
I'd have known that was your 
Yeah.
garden.
Because of all the trimmings.
Well it's  not very good this year aren't they?
No, they're not very good at all!
Well bearing in mind 
In fact , we're disappointed with it cos usually we have vegetables  out of our own garden all the year round but  they didn't do very well this year did they?
No.
It's 
Why's that?
the worst garden had for years!
It's a dry summer time.
Really!
Last summer time, I mean 
Ah yes!
last year I was  cutting cauliflowers weighing nearly five and seven pound, but this year I shan't have  one weight two pound!
Is that because of the dry winter?
Yeah, dry is dry autumn too, you see.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
They didn't really get a hold did they?
They didn't get a hold, didn't get a start.
Really?
Aha.
See an a , I wouldn't like other people keep using the water cos they  very careful on using the water
Yes.
but if I'd have give it, had to give them some water they'd have  done much better but I, like everybody else we kept hoping it were gonna rain,but  !
That's right.
Yeah.
And it never did at the right 
No.
time.
No.
No, I see.
No, I mean we have to tops this time of year, we ain't got any in this year.

Oh my word!
They're used to be one, one of them what got killed used to, he used to ride his bike up and down the path here  and sh , as start, he'd get on his bike, she'd run down to that bush down there and then get there before him and then, soon as he start to come back he was running back and beat him!
Really?
Yeah, well that's  only he went up and down there.
They're lovely aren't they when they're li 
And she'd got  
when they're intelligent like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
While I'm digging that garden she used to go out roll in the  trench what I'd dug and soon as I went in for a drink she was in there before me!
 
She'd beat him in the kitchen!
And er
I think cats can be lovely!
Oh yes.
We  and i it's, when we had  sprouts it used to get its hind legs and pull them down and start ploughing at them.
Really?
And then when 
And they'd pull the sprouts up  
Yeah, but what about erm what, what it keep doing with your  sprouts?
Oh the  , sprouts  got you in the bath, went to  and er  kitchen to clean the sprouts, chuck them in a bowl  I thought that's funny, I didn't chuck that one in there!
Course, I was looking out the window  and I know he took  I picked it out and   it  I looked again, there's another one in there, course she's only getting out the bath put them in a bowl like I was!
I can't believe my own eyes!
No!
And as soon as I went to get sprouts off a garden, she'd be on there, won't she, would?
Yeah.
She'd pull them off the stalks.
Really?
Yeah.
And just, she was playing ball in other words wasn't she?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
And erm  we made it little to , potatoes and then dig them up what you don't want
Yes.
you could chuck them for her and she used to go after them.
Did she?
Yeah.
 
Oh how sweet!
Was she the one that was killed?
Yeah.
That's a shame isn't 
Mm.
it?
But, was it on this main road?
No, she was fine that one was.
Oh that's 
No, that's Whisky what was killed on the main road who done that,
Ah, ah Whisky, so was that er, other one what we had.
Yeah.
Milly done it as well.
Yes.
Really?
Milly, yes.
Milly.
That was her daughter.
Oh I see.

And was it on the main road that the one who was killed 
Yeah, we go had one killed  a school teacher down here killed one of them.
When was that?
Ain't erm  about three weeks ago weren't it?
Two weeks ago.
Panda.
That was Panda.
Another one killed on the  main road as well.
It's heartbreaking!
Wonder who that was?
I know.
We would love to have erm 
 
we'd love to have a cat but 
Yes , well er 
partly  it's a tie if we're wanting to go out.
And i in a way it is 
But not 
But also it's er, it's  it's too risky on that road.
It is too risky!
Well it weren't exactly the school teacher's fault cos  Panda jumped out of the hedge into the lights from the cemetery cos she liked to go mousing up there.
Ah, what a shame!
And when she come and knocked on the door she was upset more than we was cos she done it didn't 
Ah 
she?
yes.
Yeah.
Yes, well it is upsetting.
It's 
Mm.
upsetting
Yeah.
to you to lose a cat isn't it?
Yeah, and it's erm like our other one, she used to go hunting up there and she's across the main road 
No don't worry about it.
and onto the fields.
Aha.
But erm  so far Betty, she's alright, she sort of looks and
It's amazing, some cats will get an instinct  
Yeah, aye that's yeah, yeah.
won't they?
Mm, yeah.
We had one that was very  canny 
Mm.
about the road.
But we had one killed on the road too.
Well we had one 
So she 
what used to do the sprouts didn't I?
Yes,
Honestly, that's tremendous!
That's terribly funny!
Mm.
That really is.
Oh she was a character that one!
Was she?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well they all were really, they all had 
Yeah.
their different
Yeah.
their different characteristics
Yeah.
cos I mean  Pimple used to erm
used to run and  
have 
anywhere.
see Len come along, used to run  and jump up at, onto his shoulder and  go round the garden shoulders!
Really?
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh he and coming up that passage, run and jump right up on me by getting up my shirt.
Well when Panda , when you were peeling potatoes she sort of lying on your back when you was bending there like that.
Yeah that's it !
Yes !
A good place to be!
Yeah.
I I like cats better than dogs because 
Yes.
I think  dogs want a fuss made of them, cats don't really.
No, no no
The , there's a way of 
they don't like , they don't like 
They're independent.
a lot of fuss.
No.
They're much more independent.
Yes.
Apparently, she sort of 
 
lays on that hearth 
right, and right in front of the fire and their  two feet sort of on guard sitting, and his down like that.
Feeling the fire.
Yeah.
Yes !
Yeah.
Let's see how you've been getting on.
Do you get at school any erm  any sort of music lessons?
Erm  yes.
On Thursdays I go to music lesson  and erm, we have this singing contest  erm, we come second out of the  first years, and we sung Mole in a Hole.
Good!
Erm  at dinner times you can go into the music room  erm  you can play on any music instrument you like  there's  keyboards  erm, violins  guitars erm  drums.
I tried to play on the drums, I'm not too good at that.
They make a terrible noise don't they ?
Yeah.
Erm  Only trouble, there's a snare drum  you can turn it onto snare or ordinary but when you have it on snare, if you play  or anything it rattles!
Is it erm, is a snare the thing that co , the sort of wire that goes across it?
Yeah.
And what does that do?
Erm, well  it makes erm  a lighter so , makes the drum sound to a lot of  lighter sounds.
Oh I see.
But erm, when you play music and you keep it on snare the wires keep rattling.
Ah yes.
So, you have to erm  pull this  erm, little lever at the side  and that  that'll  turn the snare bit off  they can play on there  erm  there's  the choir, erm
Are you in the choir?
Erm, no I don't know much about it yet, we haven't  I've only just  been told about it by a friend who I sit next to on the bus.
You've only been there  I think a ba , a term haven't you?
Yeah.
So tha , yes.
Mhm.
So we don't know much about it yet, but on Thursdays we  get, we've got taught how to play  erm  a keyboard and been taught a little bit about reading music.
But 
Good!
erm, I can't read it too well cos I've only had about  couple of lessons on it.
Yes.
It needs practice doesn't it?
Yeah.
Of course, being in the choir it gives you practice reading music  because you just have one line to follow
Yeah.
and that's a good start isn't it?
Aha 
I have heard erm  some choir, the choir sing a little bit  cos erm  we got a corridor near the  music hall  and erm  they sing up pretty loud so you can hear it.
Cos there's erm  er  machine in there  what you can get erm fo food from right, so I go down there sometimes
Yes.
get something out the machine and listen to the  music in there.
Nice!
Good!
I think it's a good school don't you?
Yeah, it's pretty good  but erm  the older ones think they run it a bit!
Yes.
But, there's, some of them are alright.
I got some  erm  friends up there who are in fourth and fifth year
Mm!
so and they  then erm  I have got  some friends I used to know as  the little school but they've left now.
Oh!
Erm, they just went on to their fifth form
Yes.
so  don't see them around much.
Mm.
Erm  I know a boy  erm  Rickie who just lives up our road
Mm.
erm  ho , I know him so I go and see him sometimes.
That's good!
Mhm.
But I don't see him that much because he go and play sports  on the 
Yes.
field.
Yes.
And then they're just not available to play  at home  th those 
No.
times.
No, that's right.
You always find wherever you are that the people who've been there a long time  get sort of erm  a bit uppity, they think that they're
Yeah.
the bosses of everything.
But of course, one of these days you'll be at the top of the school  won't 
Yes.
you !
A lot of erm  them, cos erm  we're up, we're in the upper sort of thing, we're in the upstairs  in a form room, so when we walk downstairs to erm  down to a lesson  they come barging up there and pushing out of the way!
Yes.
And that's the only trouble about it.
That's not very nice when you're a bit smaller than they are.
No.
Aha.
Erm  they  try and erm  erm  sort of push you out the way and tell you to get lost!
Yes.
Yes.
But erm 
Well when you're big, that's the thing to remember and you won't push 
Yeah.
the little ones around perhaps 
No.
will you?
I got to , when I was going to the little school I got told  the little ones.
Mm.
But they erm  I was used to it, used to it cos erm
Mm.
I got a lot of  little cousins and that
Oh of course, yes!
So you know what it's like being small
Yeah.
too.
And what about all this gardening then?
I was very interested when you were talking about gardening this morning.
Erm 
Well 
you don't do any gardening, I suppose at school?
Erm, no, I wish we could have a garden, sort of thing, like we mi , where  mum used to go and have a garden but it don't 
Mm mm.
now.
Mm.
Erm
But still, you don't need  a a garden at school, you've got the, really the whole of that garden at home.
Yeah, so
Because your father can't do much now can he?
Erm no, he does help me a few things but  I do all the digging for him because he can't bend down too much.
Yes.
Erm  I told him he ought to get erm, one of these  rotovators and a plough underneath
Ah ha ha !
but he said it's too much money cos they're 
Yes.
Yes.
a few thousand pound now.
I suppose so!
And really and truly you've got to have a very big piece of ground to need one of those haven't you?
Yeah.
I think you're a very good  forker and spader really!
Yeah, ah well  erm  when I was younger I used to watch dad  so when he put his seeds out I used to erm get the erm  erm  erm, spade and sort of keep digging them up,se seeds up 
 
so I got, I got to know how to use them by then  then  then erm  while I've got older dad got another piece of ground what he's given up now
Mhm.
erm  he , we used to go up there.
Where was that  er
Erm
Ben?
up our road and  very first house, number one, he had a big bit of garden
Oh I see.
erm  but  after a few months dad gave it up cos it was  erm  too  wet and that where weeds could grow easily
Ah yes.
and we keeps erm  digging it up and  weeds keep growing.
Yes.
We had potatoes in there for a time but we had to keep hoeing all the weeds out.
No, and of course the weeds will have a
Yeah, they  
a fine old time won't they?
Yeah.
Aha.
But your ground, I  imagine you've kept it fairly cre , free of weeds  for quite a 
Yeah.
time now?
Erm  on our  some of our small plants  we don't use any erm  sprays or 
No.
we use erm  a rake  or a  and we draw across the seeds and  that'll  ra , bring out the weeds.
Yes.
I done that  on my wheat this afternoon  erm  but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos 
Mm.
we don't have to sort of, ain't gotta take really too much muck
Mm.
Yes.
cos we do  half, we muck erm  I've grown pretty well
Mm.
so it gives the plants a boost
Yes.
so we don't have too much muck so, and like  put some fertiliser on the other bits.
I see.
Because, in fact, you can't put that compost  on the, or that muck on the, when you say muck, do you mean the compost that you make with the vegetables?
Yeah.
Yes.
Erm, you can't put that on till it's really broken down can you?
No.
So it's erm  you use up probably quite quickly what you've got.
Yes, erm  all our  sort of cabbage stalks and  beans stalks go onto  the muck heap  to turn into a sort of compost, but  other people they just sort of burn  or take them away and buy a bag of compost.
Yes.
But erm  bought bags of compost aren't so good  cos if you use all er, stuff you're growing you put erm  it back onto the ground
Mm.
Mm.
what's come off the ground.
Mm, yes.
Yes, it seems reasonable doesn't it, to put it all back?
It's all been natural stuff hasn't it?
Yes.
Aha.
Which bit of the gardening do you like best?
Well erm  the best bit, I like harvesting, I don't like  the digging is alright but it hurt your back so 
Yes.
You get  yo wo once you've done a lot you suddenly 
Yeah.
feel it don't you?
But the hoeing is nice and easy
Yeah, okay.
more or less.
Mm.
We got erm  various sorts of hoes.
We got a Dutch hoe, that's 
Mm.
pretty easy to use.
Nice!
And erm, we got another hoe  oh er, I don't like using it cos it's got wood and it keeps giving me splinters!
It's got, oh really, that's the handle is it, that does 
Yeah.
that?
Hiya Ben!
Ho 
Hello.
Hello.
We've got a hoe that  what is that hoe called, that we've got Noel?
It's  got these prongs that go like that.
Oh, what's 
Erm 
that for?
Oh yeah, I've got one of them.
Have you got one of them?
Because they get, the weeds out quite deeply don't they?
Er, oh yes.
Erm , I got two of them.
Mm!
I bought one  erm  I think it was a year or two back  then our next door neighbour di , well  no, it was before she died, she gave me one.
Nice!
Mhm.
So I got  quite a lot of old tools, really old ones
Yes.
dad's got  loads of old ones, what he use 
Has he?
I like them better than the modern ones.
Do you?
Yes th , there's something nice about the old tools isn't there?
Yes, cos they 
We've got one hoe that's at least two hundred years old!
Yes.
Yeah , yeah.
And we've, but only found the  middle part
Mm.
and I had it  sharpened by Hector 
Yes.
and now it's as good as new!
You can see it afterwards.
Yes, where erm  my next neighbour gave me  some stuff erm, then I went into her shed cos she had  erm, some mice problems so dad went in there to  have a look round, seeing the poison were  wore off and we found  quite a lot of old gardening chu , tools.
Ooh did you?
Cos erm  her husband was a farmer we found a lot of old  really old ploughshares  like 
Yes.
that.
Yes.
I found an old plough wheel, I still got that at home.
I like keep  an antique stuff like that.
Oh yes, it's interesting!
Aha.
Erm  and, she had some  erm  chicken ho er,hoppers that erm  she had
Chicken hoppers?
Yes, erm  used to put, you put feed in them
Oh yes.
and they soon get erm  but they had plastic ones and they have lights on them.
Really?
Yeah, but they smell!
Oh, do they?
Yeah, erm  when we're up the farm  when er, after a few days we put the feed in them they smell.
Oh that's not nice is it?
No, cos all the  plastic sort of
Yes, that's because they've got a light on them isn't it?
Yeah.
Yes some erm  some light, electric light fittings are made of plastic and they like bad fish  after 
Yeah.
a time don't they?
It's horrid!
Yeah, erm when we  went in there for a few times used to get headaches and that.
Yes, nasty!
Yeah, but the weather was cold, when cold that er, it took away some of the smell
Mhm.
but as they got muddier it  worsened.
Yes.
I in the end it gets yuck!
Yeah.
Erm  the really old sheds they're better than the new ones that
Yes.
Mm.
erm  they er, they're cool in the  summer and warm in the winter.
Mm.
Mm.
For that  stuff.
That's an advantage?
Yeah.
I've erm  dad had a lot of old gardening to , tools up in er  his shed when  he was up  but  when we  when dad retired he was going to erm  take them, but he forgot about them
Ah!
and they left them up there.
Oh dear!
So, I don't know wha , we, he did get some  but erm  a lot of them  he wished he'd brought
Yes.
and left the other ones.
Oh dear!
He brought the wrong ones he thought!
Oh that's 
Yeah.
hard-liners isn't it?
Yeah.
And where do you keep all this stuff?
You haven't got a shed have you, in the back?
We got  two, one was an old erm  air dru , no  one of them erm, bomb shelter type things
Oh yes, Anderson shelter!
Yeah.
Mm.
And er  we had a wooden shed  it blew down in a gale so  my Nana, she bought us a shed
Oh!
for a present.
Oh that's nice!
So we put that up.
We keep some tools in it.
We put our cat in there cos she like going in there  and we have some ta , we put seed and that down there.
Our other sh shed we put all the tools and
Yes.
To keep them out of the weather.
You've just got to have somewhere to put them haven't you?
Yes.
Aha.
Cos erm  well if you leave them lying about they'll rust easily.
Yes.
Now that's quite true.
Well you're quite an experienced gardener, it seems to me Ben!
You must of learned a lot from your father by now?
Yes, erm  I  get erm  some mags, ah erm  gardening magazines and I look at them.
Oh yes, that's useful!
Mhm.
Erm , dad tells me a lot about it cos he  started gardening when he was young.
Yes.
He got a lot  taught a lot off granddad.
Mhm.
Erm, so it sort of originated in our family.
That's right, a family thing, you hand it down from generation to generation
Yes.
don't you?
And the books of , are useful because there are lots of new ideas have come up
Yes.
as you go along.
Erm  er  mum gets some for me on Wednesdays sometimes, when she goes to Framlingham.
There's various ones I read  I had one from  the library, it was a big one
Mhm.
erm  I was reading about carrots, so I didn't get to finish it cos we only had two weeks.
Erm  little window box ones.
Mhm.
Er, what you grow in a window boxes.
The little 
Mm mm.
erm  short ones, and they're sweet.
Yes.
Carrots?
Yeah.
Yes, some of them are nearly round
Yeah.
they're so small!
Yes.
Aren't they?
Tha look, they look funny to me!
And when I  erm, first got them  cos my granny got me  some for a birthday present
Aha.
erm  when we've dug them up I  I didn't think they looked like carrots until we had 
No.
them.
That's right they, and they must be a bit fiddly to peel mustn't they?
To scrape, rather.
Yeah.
Instead of a nice long scrape, you've got to go round corners haven't you?
Yeah I keep, when I  I I always scrape the vegetables sometimes but when I do though I keep cutting my fingers!
Ugh, yes, yes!
So I gave them to dad to do.
Ha!
What's the idea of those little carrots?
I don't know.
Er  erm, there's only been  last year that I've grown them
Yes.
so I don't know much about them yet.
Did you like the taste of them?
Yes they're, they're nice and sweet.
Are they?
Mm.
Erm  other carrots, erm they don't grow that well, I don't think so anyway.
No.
Well there's so many things that get into carrots aren't there?
There's a wa , a wire worm or something?
Yes erm
And carrot fly.
Is carrot fly the thing that goes for carrots or not?
Erm, yes  tha , that will come in really bad!
Mm.
Slugs, erm  they'll 
Mm.
go after carrots and potatoes.
Mm.
Erm  one year we got no end of slugs!
Erm  leatherjackets, they're bad for them.
Oh yes!
Mm.
Erm  so when you sort of dig the ground up you have to chuck them out the way.
Yes.
Cos they'll, they'll work their way back in.
I'm sure.
Start eating the  plants and that.
The plants.
Yes.
Yes.
That's why I say  nature works against you instead of with you.
Yeah.
So I don't bother!
Don't you put any lime on them?
Erm  well  we have tried it once  erm but  we put soot on them because they'll so 
Yes, soot is supposed to be good for something.
Yes.
Erm, that will sa , that will stick to them and erm  they will  that will make them  feel ill so they 
Yes.
die.
Yes.
And erm, soot's good for the ground.
I see.
Dad used to put erm  a lot on it  but we had to have erm  the chimney sweep at ours for  quite a long time
No.
and he hadn't got any.
You'll have to get some more soot.
You'll have to get him along and you can have some more soot.
Yes.
I've forgotten what they used to use so soot especially.
My father used it, but I've forgotten what it was.
Never use it on vegetables, around vegetables  to stop  insects creeping too.
Does it?
It'll stop them from  crawling across,
They don't like it?
just under the surface, they couldn't get .
No.
No.
Aha.
There are so many  things you've got to be looking out for in those
Yes, erm  I read up quite a lot of things about  keeping pests away, but I don't  dad reads them  and tells me about them, but I forget cos they have to go back
That's right.
after so often.
Yes.
Let's see what we've got there.
Ben would like to go to  Otley to do a proper 
 
training course.
That's a very good idea Ben.
Yes.
Yes.
And so  you're going to work at the things that will get you in there aren't you?
Yeah, so I  will do  quite a lot of erm, stuff erm  I should say  in geography, sort of work in geography for that things.
Erm  we done a little but we hadn't done that much yet, but my sister tells me  as we go , as the year go on and do a bit more about it.
Mm.
You learn about soil formations and that sort 
Yeah.
of thing.
Yes.
How old are Ben?
Sorry?
How old are you Ben?
I'm twelve.
Twelve.
Mhm.
Mm.
He's a wonderful gardener  for twelve, I can tell you!
Good!
Ha ha.
Erm  and 
And what else would help you to get into Otley?
I suppose you've got to be able to do  maths for most things haven't you?
Yes, erm  and when you go to Otley College  they will  teach you everything, so you need maths,or this erm  
Yes for 
 
measuring an an yes.
Yes erm  I'm not looking forward to doing the  cos they've told me about it and he used to get headaches and 
Really?
Well I think that you wear masks now don't you, when you use it?
Erm, yes, erm  if you haven't got a  tractor you have to, but if you've got  you don't have to so much.
I see.
But erm  if I, when I go to a farm I don't want  spray.
No?
Well it would, not very good for you would it really, because of your 
No.
chest?
Mm.
Yes.
Aha.
Erm  I don't mind fertiliser, that's okay.
Mm.
And  but
What we were talking about, or what I think is interesting is  your experience from your early days in horse shoeing  has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving  erm  if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that.
Yeah well er  the shoeing today is  completely different to what it was when I started  nearly sixty year ago.
In them days  horses were  they were all working hors , driving horses  you hardly ever see a riding horse.
Er  the ones they did ride were the ones they used to drive at erm ah, down the  two jars but er  and that was a completely different  way of life then  to what that is now.
Er 
Mm.
er the horses that are shod today, you see they all  riding horses, no  very few working horses.
Yes.
Er  but now the 
It's, and that's your hobby isn't it?
Yeah.
Yes.
Er  where before that was  the horse  was equivalent for a motor today.
Yes.
So that was a living.
It did the 
Er 
job of a tractor, it did the 
 
job a van  a lorry
Lorry.
a car, everything!
Yeah.
Yes.
Ah , every form of transport
Transport.
when you think about it.
Yes.
Mhm.
And is it 
But now 
different type of horse that makes it different for  shodding 
Oh yes!
today?
Oh yeah!
Not the question of the same horses doing a different job.
No, that's a different type of horse er
Yes.
er, the old fashioned working horses  er  practically extinct.
Yes.
And the shires are still there fairly strong, still  er  some of course has now gone onto the  rare breeds.
Mm!
Er  registered you see.
Er  Welsh colts  and  things of that nature are coming back a bit now, they are  building up now  er  but 
But would I be right in saying that  the everyday working horse, the sort of, general purpose working horse that people used years ago, people such as carriers, they would use horses which were crossbreeds wouldn't they?
Not 
Yeah.
not a purebred anything.
Not a pure , no!
They'd be good old heavy, honest, rough 
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
hard working horses.
That's right.
Not things of beauty really at all.
No.
No, ooh no, no!
And you hardly ever see that type now do you?
Gypsies 
No.
have them.
You still 
They were 
see gypsies with that sort.
built for strength
Yes.
for the 
Yeah.
jobs.
Yes.
Work.
Yes.
Were they?
Yeah.
Purely for 
Yeah.
work and hardiness.
And they're ornaments today, they aren't working horses.
That's right.
You put these horses into hard work today they'd be dead within three months!
Would they?
Ooh yes!
Yeah!
Yes, the whole scene has altered.
And er, as I say, observing this and watching Hector's work and how things have gone on over the years, er as you know, there's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving, so many people  have er, restored carts or had new ones built  and erm  the young farriers who've never had the experience with driving horses, they have run into problems with erm, keeping them going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses are driven on the road a lot.
Yeah.
Mm.
Would you like to tell us a bit more about that?
Well, yeah that is, I'm  I mean that's a completely different  er er  laxing of the, it's completely different.
Er  when you're riding a horse, you see the weight is all on the back  er  whichever tendency  do and what we call the gait  er 
Yes.
is the hind legs in the front
Yes.
they have a tendency to open them  make them wider apart 
Oh yes!
by the backs.
G A I T.
That's right, that kind of gait.
By the back and swop them you see.
Well  er, with a driving horse that's completely opposite because yo your vehicle behind the horse  is pushing  against it
Yes.
and have a tendency to   punt the back
Really?
so that pushes the  legs fo closer together, do you see?
Good heavens!
They're more likely to  
And then they're more likely to hit, they're more likely to hit 
Mm.
the  front legs with the back legs
Really!
when they're going, especially going down hill.
And of course, there's a word in the trade for that isn't there?
Yeah.
Forging.
What is it?
It's what, now there's a 
Forging?
completely 
Yeah.
different use for the word forging.
Now, is it related to forging ahead  in any way?
Oh do , is that where forging ahead comes 
I 
from?
When you're really pushing?
Yeah, yeah, pushing.
It might well be.
It might 
Yes.
well be.
I would say the term 
And, and then they can 
forging ahead has come from  the use of that word in relation to horses.
Yes.
Yes.
I would say, because that 
Yeah, probably.
dates back many, many years doesn't 
Yeah.
it?
Yeah.
Yes.
Because they 
That's it.
do do it when they're pushing ahead 
Yeah.
they, they hit the front foot with the hind one.
Good Lord!
Occasionally you 
Yeah.
hear them do it
Oh!
when they're driving, it's quite a sharp 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
crack you 
Yeah.
hear.
It's amazing!
Mm.
Er  so that's, that's completely different do you see?
So the styling of shoeing  is different.
Mm.
Completely different.
If they do it too much then the farrier's not doing a good job 
Job.
and his job
Really?
is to re-balance the shoe so that er, it just misses 
Miss.
the front foot as it comes forward.
If the 
Right.
if the horse is travelling fast on the road he's at the trot, I mean it isn't 
Yes.
the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road, they never ever should.
No.
Erm, but at the trot, when th the the legs are moving the diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come very close together 
Ah that's it!
at one point in the gait 
Yeah.
and if the 
Yes.
shoe is slightly wrongly balanced, or the foot is slightly wrongly trimmed, then you get these troubles, you 
Yeah.
also get what we call, brushing don't you?
Brushing.
When they 
Tell Edith about that.
when they hit both legs together  like the hind legs when they  they'll hit each other they'll hit one hind leg 
They really, they 
with other one you see.
They really 
Ooh!
wear
They give it a .
a a a sore place 
Ooh yes!
on the 
Yes.
Like us banging our ankles like that.
That's it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
They do it on what we call the coronet
Yeah.
which is of course the little  junction between the skin and the hair.
Yeah.
Ooh!
Very tender place.
It's like the quick of our nail
Ooh yes!
where the
I can imagine!
tissue grows from.
And they do 
And on the front 
damage their coronet.
On the front one they do it on the knee which is the  er  do you see, which is higher up.
Yes.
Yeah.
But the knee comes sort of out 
Out.
doesn't it?
Er inside 
Yeah.
Yeah.
there's a
Yeah.
nobble
Yeah.
Yes.
on the, yes.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.
Yeah so, and that's what they call cutting.
Mm.
Yeah.
Mm.
Really?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
You'd never dream!
And so people who go and, usually into horses  need to know all these or else they're going to be very unfair to the horse.
Well er 
They should know about it!
They should know it.
Yes.
They should know it.
But er 
But it , mainly it's the farrier's job to know.
Yes.
But course, they don't er 
It's his responsibility.
they don't do enough work to really  create any problems today, do you see what they're to do  somebody will say ooh we'll go out for a ride
Yes.
they're out, half an hour?
Yes.
Hey?
We'll go out for a drive  probably out an hour, whereas years ago the horse used to come out the stable at seven in the morning  he wouldn't go back till probably five at night.
Course!
Probably later than that!
Mhm.
He'd go  the driving horses, they'd probably go to  Wickham market Monday  do you see, the sale on the Monday  they'd go to Ipswich on the Tuesday  er  Wednesday they'd go to Bury  er  and  Ailsworth 
Yes.
And they really earned their 
Then they'd go to Norwich.
keep!
Full time job!
Ooh they worked hard!
And then they'd go to Norwich on the Saturday.
Mm.
I mean they'd, they'd, they'd be doing probably  anything up to forty mile a day weren't they?
Would be.
Yeah.
Yes.
And I mean, that was six days a week!
Yes.
But now they do  er  twenty minutes they think they'd have done wonders!
Yes.
Or go from pub to pubs 
You know.
that's about it !
Yeah.
 
And you think of these , for instance Prince 
Mm.
Yeah.
Phillip, who is 
Yeah.
Yeah.
presumably those horses don't do long spells of that sort 
No.
of driving?
No.
No.
They'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they?
Exercised, yeah, they're exercised, normal exercise during the week and then  when they do these events do you see?
But of course, if you go back far enough do you see  on these four in hands were  were going from town to town weren't they?
I mean, they were  they were mail originally weren't they?
On the stage coaches, yes.
Mhm.
Stage coaches 
Mhm.
Yes.
Er  on the horses  that's understandable, they can start off and probably don't knock theirself  but there's a time they'd done twenty or thirty mile pulling a load.
They're tired,
They're tired 
Mhm.
er, and then they start  and that's when the trouble starts.
Just as we do, walking a bit less 
Yes.
carefully.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, the same 
Yeah.
thing applies.
Mm!
Exactly!
Mm!
And
What about  er, in those days  er, possibly a few still, when erm  let's, you said gypsies didn't you?
Mm.
or let's say just erm  odd tradesmen had  a horse or a pony or whatever it was  pulling a cart  round the streets with vegetables or with, with er coal 
Yeah.
or something  what about the  amount of  care they would get from a farrier, those horses?
Well they  they got reasonable care because, like I said, that was, that was the  the owner knew that er  that was his livelihood then
That's the thing I suppose, yes.
and he treated his horse  well I mean a lot of these horseman, good horseman  treated the horse better than they did the wife!
I wouldn't be surprised about that !
Ooh yes!
Living in the East 
Yes.
End, I wouldn't be surprised 
Mm mm.
at that!
Oh yes!
Er  and they thought of, I mean they thought the world of their  their animals and  but 
Yes.
er  when  you were in the trade like  mine  if you didn't do a good job  the man never come back to you, there was a, there was a blacksmith farrier in every village!
Yes.
Some villages had two
Mhm.
And if you didn't do the job properly you didn't get the job and if you didn't get the job you went hungry!
Course!
So that er  that made you do it properly!
Yes.
Yes, they were a 
And there was no  there was no  if you hadn't  earned a shilling  you'd got nothing to eat had you?
That's right.
Necessity being a good driver.
Absolutely!
Well, yeah!
Yeah.
Erm, Hector often quotes one particular instance which illustrates that very well  er  a as recently as your time, after you were er er shoeing 
Yeah.
in your own business and everything, er people often say what did you used to charge?
And it was six and eight pence for a set of shoes on a 
Six and eight pence, yes.
heavy horse, a land horse  such as a Suffolk, as most of them were, erm  but  times were so tight that there was a farmer who used to send his horse with his horseman right past here and go another mile down the road to, to the next village to  Kettleborough where there was ano , there were two farriers there
Yeah.
and one of them was doing them a halfpenny cheaper!
Ooh!
Six and seven pence halfpenny.
Halfpenny 
And the farmer thought that it would  
Payed him to do it.
to send them an extra mile each way and the extra 
Really!
time that took  to get them shod a halfpenny cheaper!
And things were as tight as that!
As tight as that?
Yeah.
Yes!
Yeah.
Yes.
Mm.
So 
I suppose, now would, could that possibly be called a false economy?
What was he using up 
It probably was.
time?
Well if that was, I meant  that would be today
Yes.
but er  in them days there was no such thing as  false economy, I'd and I, economy didn't come into it 
No.
else he'd of  I mean 
No.
er
People didn't set the same  cost value on time as they 
Time.
I was going to say, time 
do now.
didn't count in the same
No and er 
It really didn't seem to
No.
it's very funny that!
Mm.
If you're  if you hadn't earned the money well  you didn't go into it in detail and  get the time and motion study man 
No.
in to look at the job did you?
Just thought 
That's right.
well  we'd better pull ourselves together and see if we can put this right!
That's right.
Er  you never really went into it to see where you had lost the money.
No.
No.
Er  but you just grabbed a little harder so that you made ends meet
That's right.
By the result you 
Yeah.
Yeah.
would see that you had to work a bit 
Yeah.
harder and  
There was no  no working out to see how you could do anything cheaper.
No.
No.
No.
Aha.
But any economy that was made  or in the early days of Hector's er  business, I know, was always saving material rather than time.
 
Yes.
Erm  and the instinct remains doesn't it?
Oh yeah!
Your your instinct is to save 
a bit harder.
an odd bit of se steel or iron off a bar which the modern man would say well there's 
 
no point in saving that because by the 
That's right.
time you've looked 
Yeah.
for it and found it when you want it  er, it would have paid you to cut a bit off a new bar.
That's it.
Time costing as much 
Yes.
as it now does.
Time now 
Yeah, that's right.
is er, is the main driving thing but  in your early days it was material every time.
Oh material every time!
Erm  tell Edith 
Labour 
about some of the er er oh normal economies that were made, like, erm making odd links 
Well, oh well the horse 
into staples and all that sort of thing.
well the horse shoes you see, we used to  we used to weld  one and a half  old horse shoes together in the fire  to make one new one again.
Really?
Ooh yes!
They weren't thrown 
One turned the other way on top 
We 
of the other?
used to  get one shoe and a  ta , in the middle so that, so that cut the  half new one
Yes.
turn it over on itself  then the other one we used to half
Oh!
and put the other  piece in between the two and make a sandwich
Golly yes!
so you'd got a piece that shape, half  new one
Yes.
and that was all welded together in the fire  into a straight bar
And then you'd start all over again!
and then you'd start all over again!
Oh I see.
You didn't use 
Mm.
that as a shoe  you then 
Re 
made it an a new 
Re-shape it.
piece of metal?
Yes.
And then 
Yes.
yeah, and then re re-used it to shoe.
Mm.
Made another shoe out of a
That's right 
er 
yes.
And that was a genuine economy then.
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Er 
Erm
old cart tyres we used to split them up the middle and made shoes.
Did you?
Oh yes!
Er
Because they were made of the right kind of iron?
Yeah.
Er 
And erm 
you see, we used to  when old shoes do you see, you could only use them  a certain number of times by  welding them up
Yes.
er  after they got so you  hadn't got no more life in them we used to  weld short bits onto  .
Really?
 
Yeah.
Still all done in the fire.
Yeah.
Wired?
Old chains 
And 
when they wore thin on the end  and we had to put a new link in  we never threw the two halves of the link away, we pointed them and made them into staples.
Really?
Because the middle part of the link wasn't worn you see, that was still a good bit of metal in it.
Yes, course.
Yeah.
Isn't it  tragic to think how far from that we've moved?
Yes , it is really.
Yeah, mm.
Yes, it's 
And it's so wasteful u 
it's all throw away 
Yeah.
now isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah.
It seems morally wrong.
It hurts us 
Yeah.
who've known 
Yes.
the other thing doesn't it?
Yes it does!
Yeah, yeah.
Mm.
It goes against the grain terribly!
And I am  if at five minutes to five, or five minutes to leaving off time  whatever it was  and you wouldn't say well  we'll get ready to go home  you had to pick a half a link up  make it into a staple and throw it in the box.
Yes.
That was ready for next time and you've saved 
That was ready for when  Yeah.
that time.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yes.
I forget what it was you used to make old horse rasps into because for
Ooh yes!
farrier has a, has a file  with very, very coarse teeth on one side 
That's right.
and slightly less coarse on the other
Yes.
is used for rasping the the hoof  erm  I can't remember what you used 
We used to use all sorts of things.
used the old ones for.
Hooks, flashers.
Because that's a special hard  steel isn't it?
It's hard steel, now.
It's not ordinary iron is it?
They used to use, make them into flashers and hooks for hedge cutting and
Mm.
hoes for chopping out sugar 
Mm.
beet.
Yes, because of course you had all the equipment to shape it up anew
Yeah.
didn't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
You could make whatever sort of shape you wanted from it  I should 
Yeah.
imagine .
Yep!
Mm.
Yeah.
That's an i ,i interesting thing talking about the names of the tools too erm  flashers and hooks, now in other parts 
Now you never hear that.
of the country you would probably hear them called a slasher and a  what?
I mean, nearly all people  think a hook is a hook don't do, for hanging 
Yes.
things on?
Mm.
Yes.
Well in Suffolk you see, a hook is a thing for cutting the hedge.
Yes 
A hooker.
a a curved scy a sickle type 
A  , yeah.
shaped thing.
Yes.
Yes.
Or a chopper.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah.
I see.
And you just call that a hook?
A hook, yeah.
So you di , did you call the thing you were doing hooking  or not?
What er
Wi with hook, would you say 
When you were using it
that you were hooking 
No you'd be 
the hedge or not?
You'd be hedging.
You're hedging.
Yeah, hedging them.
Yes, I see.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah,
The tool was a separate name?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really?
Aha.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And did you have to repair things, well you probably did, er farm instruments, I don't mean the big implements but things like their scythes and what 
Oh yes!
have you?
We used to ma , we used to buy the scythe blade and 
Well that was the blacksmith's bread and butter, that kind of thing.
and do all the other  iron work on it, you see, yes.
Yes.
Oh yes!
Mhm.
Yeah.
Hoes and  things like that were all  er  hand made.
Ha!
Spuds, dock spuds  thistle spuds.
Have you come across a spud?
Now how do you spell that, S P A D
It would be G D. 
G E. 
Yeah.
I think it would be S P U D
D, yeah.
Yes?
Oh just a s 
Yes?
Spud.
Yes.
Sped?
Spud.
I think so.
I think so.
Really?
Yeah.
Th , it's a dialect word really.
Oh not erm, not a  spadge Yo er
No.
I heard the name  spadge when I was  
No, it would be spud wouldn't it?
No,spud.
Really?
Yeah.
It's probably in the dialect book, I haven't looked it up.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm rather 
And another good old word is the crome, now er that was one I came across for the first time when I came into Suffolk, the crome.
I jolly soon learnt what a crome was, I didn't ask I waited to find out.
learn a foreign language 
Yes.
isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
What, what was that?
Well a a 
Mm mm.
crome is a
He couldn't believe I didn't know what a crome was!
that's ooh ah 
 
well either two or four times  er  turned down on a long handle  for pouring  things  er  out of the, I mean like, when I used to
I know what it is now.
when they used to put er  the muck on the fields  they used to put so many loads of eight and so many heaps of the   well, when they pulled it out of the  room  they'd pulls out the crome.
Like a fork bent at right angles.
Angles.
Oh!
It's the ideal thing for that 
 
job 
Yes.
you see.
Yes.
A fork , only  bent over.
I see!
Mhm.
And the old
Yes.
the real old  gardeners  and I mean well every house had one  because they used to grow their own vegetables didn't they?
That's right.
Well when they dug the garden, after they'd dug it they always cromed it down with a crome before they planted anything.
Really?
Used the crome as the rake.
Aha.
Now could that be 
Mm mm.
the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he saw one of the men in the village, using it to pull out a lot of weed from undergrowth, really 
I expect so.
I expect so.
it's er,i and it's got three prongs  like that, and there's, I think, an arrowhead shape on each prong.
Ah that'd be the modern ones.
Yes.
Yes, that would be 
Yes.
the modern
The modern one, but er 
adaptation.
Yeah.
Yes.
That'd be the modern one.
Similar principle.
Yes.
Sim sim 
Mhm.
Yes.
Yeah.
It is 
Yeah.
erm, for getting up  a lot 
Yes.
of weed?
Yes.
Yeah.
The old style crome would be a thing about as wide as that
Yeah, about ten 
What about 
ten inches wi and the 
Mhm.
would be 
Yes and  and the  would be parallel
Parallel.
four times, wouldn't they?
Four.
And e , equally distanced.
Fo for that work.
Ah yes!
Mhm.
But for  pulling the muck out of the tumble  they only have two.
Oh!
Two tines.
Did they?
Yeah.
More like a pitch fork bent at right angles then?
But bent at right angles.
Yes.
That would be a muck crome?
That'd be a muck 
Yes.
crome.
Yeah.
And was a lot of straw in with that?
Oh that was all straw, do you 
Ah!
see?
Because otherwise you couldn't have pulled 
No.
er, sort of muck without 
No no.
No.
straw could you?
No , no.
No.
But straw
Yeah.
of course.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Yeah.
And the tines on a muck crome are flat, whereas the ones on an ordinary one for  all the work were either round or square.
I see.
Yeah.
Yes.
So I came across these things you see when we were first married because I used to write out all Hector's bills for him, by hand before we had a typewriter
Mhm.
and of , I'd come across these words you see, I'd think crome?Crome, what is that?
You know !
Yes.
Even to spell it 
And gradually the 
in the first place 
Yeah.
you needed 
So I had to 
to know.
yeah, so I did have to guess a great deal
Mm.
because no good looking in the dictionary for a lot of these things.
No.
No, no, no 
Mm.
no.
no.
No.
I assumed that a crome was C R O M E, and I still do!
Yes.
cos I've never come across anything else!
Well I mean all the, all the  all the dialect words are
Phonetic really 
spelt 
aren't they?
They have to be!
They're spelt as you say them.
They have to be!
They are , that's true.
Mm mm!
They are phonetic.
They're spelt how you say them so they can be spelt  er  ten different ways in the same village!
And still be right!
That's right, I see.
Because there's no  there's no dictionary spelling 
Cos I mean, I'd 
for a lot of them.
well I I spells how I say it.
Mm.
Yes.
Er  somebody up the road  er  hundred yards  would spells how he 
Mm.
say it.
I I used to notice that 
And there's just that little bit of
It was phonetic spelling!
Yes!
Yeah!
Yeah.
When the cards were, from the  er, the workshop would come in  which the lads had done their work, I mean, one of them, I know dear old Pete, in particular, he'd write for crome, C R double O M, because that's how he'd say it.
Croom.
Yes!
Yeah , croom.
Yes!
Yes.
But it's still right.
Yes!
And very often the O, in the Suffolk dialect goes to an ooh doesn't it?
Ooh yes!
Yeah.
Yes!
Yes.
Mhm.
Home.
Eith either a long ooh, or a sort ooh, like er, like in 
It's as a 
room or  
mostly a short one because 
Mm.
that's a  lazy language the Suffolk dialect innit?
I suppose it is in a way.
I suppose a lot 
You cu 
of dialect is.
cut out this 
Yes  it is isn't it?
cut everything short don't you?
Yes.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Yes you do.
Yes.
But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech that you get now, for instance, Lancashire  i it's 
Yes.
not true Lancashire that's spoken up there, it's a lazy  you 
Yes.
know up the city 
Yes 
Yeah.
yes, yes, yes.
that sort of thing.
Nothing like over 
Yes.
No.
here 
No.
dialect.
Yeah, same as the erm  what you get from the outskirts of London, the home counties, I call 
Yes.
that ugly too!
It is!
True cockney is a treat to listen to.
That's right.
But there's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home counties, I used to hear it a lot in Hertfordshire.
Yes.
Erm, especially in the war because the evacuees of course, would come along and of course 
Yes.
all the local children picked it up, of course they did!
And we'd all go home talking like them and our mothers complained !
Er, but it was interesting all the same.
It was interesting to hear them.
Indeed!
Yes.
But that a thousand  do you see a  the dialects are going
Yes.
and they'll soon be gone  and one thing which annoyed me  er  a Scotsman  or a Welshman  or an Irishman  can go on television  they'll accept them  and they can talk their
You mean as a newsreader or a a presenter of programme 
lingo, as a newsreader, as a presenter 
don't you?
Exactly!
Mm.
and yet, if anybody go on there with a southern dialect they wouldn't  well they wouldn't have them there!
That's true, isn't it?
Cos they aren't talking the queen's English!
It's taking a 
Yes.
long time for dialects to be accepted but I think  I think that boundary is giving way
Well I hope 
frankly.
it will universally because 
Mm mm.
I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their
Mm.
speech and 
Mm.
Yeah.
their traditions!
Mm.
Yeah.
You never hear on the whole  the Englishman saying  but I'm English!
Mm.
No.
No you don't.
We're 
Do you?
We're too 
No, no.
self-effacing aren't we?
And yet they'll a 
But they 
they'll accept the big proposals
Mm.
of television and radio 
Yes!
Yes!
and that .
Yes.
That's right.
Top jobs for them!
Mm.
But when you te 
And yet if you go for a top job  in the city or anywhere  an and start talking in the  southern dialect they'll  you.
Yeah, you're, you're made a laugh of aren't you?
Absolutely!
Yes.
That's very true!
It is extraordinary!
It's also true that up in 
Mm.
Scotland  they don't like to hear English accents on their television and news.
Well I never!
They much prefer to have their own people.
Ooh!
But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent?
Scot yeah!
And every time a trade unionist comes on.
Mm.
I'm afraid 
Yeah.
we've got a little phrase, another 
Yeah.
bloody Scot we say!
Yeah.
Yeah , yeah well you do!
Yeah.
And then  you've got them 
You do!
with the roughest of the 
Yes!
the trade 
Yeah.
unionists!
Yes!
Yeah.
pretty well  Scot 
Yeah, that's always  
They are!
They are!
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
So we've been perhaps a little 
Mhm.
bit erm  reticent 
Yeah.
about our dialects.
Yes.
Er Yes, yes.
I I 
But er 
think it's  time they
But I'm not gonna change, if anybody don't, but if they can't accept me 
No, I don't really think so !
well they must er   
 
Well er , you can't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and 
Yeah.
for a long time I have been
Yeah.
and you never say anything that I don't understand, unless you were to use a word like crome.
Well quite 
Oh yeah.
a word, an 
Yeah 
actual word 
Yes.
Yeah.
that you've never come across.
Yeah.
Mm.
But after all, once is enough, and once you know, you know don't you?
Exactly!
You don't forget.
No!
No.
Erm
You don't.
No.
No I 
That's right.
I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't heard the, any East Anglian dialect before at all  erm  I didn't find it difficult, there were only two cases and I can remember thinking  there were two people  er, one of whom is still alive, er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I thought when I can  follow both of them without any difficulty I shall know I really belong.
Yes.
And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis 
Mm, Dennis .
and the other one, I don't know whether you knew him, I think he lived in  Earlsome for a time didn't he?
No, well  Monksome 
Didn't he?
 Monksome 
 Monksome 
Erm, a chap called Ben   erm
No, I don't 
No.
I expect he was days before 
and my word he was difficult to follow!
Was he?
Yeah.
Yes.
Er  he spoke fast, that was the problem, most 
Oh yes!
Suffolk people don't.
No, they don't.
They give you time to listen and time to think
They do.
but he spoke quickly  with a very strong accent and that 
Yes.
took me a lot of years before I could  and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you  I've  Ben  had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we?
Yeah.
You and me and him and Joe , was another 
Yeah.
one  and we'd had a chat for a long, long time and I said to him afterwards, I was able to understand everything he said!
Wonderful!
I was so pleased !
That's an achievement !
Yes !
You know one thing that's striking me at this moment  actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you 
Mm mm.
met  er, Hector and  you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there.
That's right.
Perfectly true!
Erm , in these days when  er, so large a proportion of marriages breaks down
Mm.
erm  it seems to me that  the marriage that has an interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands
Mhm.
if you like
Mhm.
er, although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also  combine with
True, yes.
Hector's work
That has  been a great 
erm 
strength to us.
Oh, I think that's a  a tremendous 
Yes.
strength to a marriage!
Yes.
Yes.
I feel the same with Noel
Yes.
if there's something really interesting that you have 
Yes.
between the two 
Yeah.
of you
Yes.
Yeah.
erm, you don't give up at the first little hurdle.
Course you don't!
No, No.
No 
It makes an incredible bond  doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Absolutely!
Yeah.
I feel that.
Yes!
Yeah.
Yes.
Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage.
Ooh yes!
Yeah.
Yes.
It really does!
And I th , I think about a great deal because  it's a very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but  when I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before  er, I had hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I first met him
Mm.
and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home  erm  and  I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall  and erm  she at that time was expecting to get engaged to  a chappy in the village here who was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and  they didn't marry in the finish  but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her  and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry  and erm  so, it was  holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well  why not?
I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that would be alright and so er  so I came along and erm  of course, it happened that he was in the  he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came  and that was how we met.
Mm.
And erm,i it was an extraordinary thing!
But  added to that, I can well remember  staying at  Kettleborough Chequers erm  and  er  walking along  from  Kettleborough to Brandeston erm  th the very next morning after I'd come here  and I think it was before  I think it was quite likely before we had  we had actually met, I don't know whether it was the first day or the second
Yeah,
that we met in in the shop there 
 
but  the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from  Kettleborough where the gun club now is  walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow  and I can remember feeling a  extraordinarily strong sensation that  I could easily live there
Yes.
I could belong there
Yes.
and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since!
Isn't that wonderful!
But it, there was something that felt right.
I yes, I really believe in that 
Yes.
feeling!
A sense of belonging.
Most extraordinary!
I belong here.
Yes.
Yes.
Because I hadn't been around much, I hadn't been away from home
Really?
and i it was quite forcible!
Yes.
And er
Marvellous!
Yes.
I think if one's receptive to things like that
Yes.
you know, it si , it 
Yes.
it strikes you 
Yes.
doesn't it?
Yes 
Mm.
It does.
And er 
There was a rightness about it.
And you don't forget it because 
No!
you're young enough to be so impressed by it.
Mhm.
Yes.
Yes.
That's wonderful!
Yes, there was a rightness about it.
Right.
Okay .
Ha.
Erm  and er  I've felt that same  sense of rightness  at many times  over these years, this is now our  thirty seventh year?
Thirty seven, yeah I 
Nineteen 
think so.
No, thirty eight.
Thirty eight.
This is nineteen ninety two.
Yeah.
This'll be our thirty eighth year in December.
So it's several.
Erm  there have been times doing work which we have  er, worked on together  different jobs  when I have thought, yes  this is what I'm here for.
Yes.
Very, very strongly!
Yes.
And never, never more so than, of course, working on the sword stand.
Yes.
Never more so than that!
That was wonderful 
I thought 
wasn't it?
I  the work I'd done in the past  the training I've had  the experience I've had with Hector and his work  that was all leading up to that.
All coming to it.
It all came together.
Yes.
I can quite see that really.
It all came together.
Because
Yes.
that was a whole thing wasn't it?
It was the culmination.
Connection with the 
Yes.
city.
It was!
It was!
Er
Mhm.
the ancientness of the 
Mm.
actual
Yeah.
thing 
Mhm.
you were copying.
The significance of what it was for.
For.
Absolutely!
Yes.
Everything 
Absolutely!
about it.
And now, of 
Yes.
course, it sits 
Mm.
America with 
Yeah.
Mm.
its sword in it
Yeah.
Mm.
on certain occasions.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's a  it's a permanent tribute to your
It's
collaboration
It's an extraordinary 
forever in America.
it is an extraordinary thing, an 
Yes.
amazing, an amazing sensation
Yeah.
for it to be, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's wonderful!
Yes.
Yes.
And erm
