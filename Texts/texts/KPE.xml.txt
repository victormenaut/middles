She thinks she's tall.
Look at him  big shoes  
So what, so what  say it right here.
Come and say it right here.
Ian.
Ah high.
platform shoes.
He's actually  on  platforms.
How anybody can walk in those things I don't know of any.
I walk in those things 
Are quite high but when you come down then you same size.
I got a pair of  yeah.
I mean they was, they are not  new because they was when I was a kid people were .
Come back out innit?
Sixties.
How many people have done their, at my age, done their feet in because  wearing them I don't know.
I know Sir.
Because I mean did you see that er  on er they showed it on the Clothes Show that thing when she was wearing it.
She went over.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
She  innit.
I'm surprised she, surprised she didn't break her ankles.
Oh well.
That's how it is Sir.
never keep it up  
style innit, that's the style, platforms.
No .
Yeah but my ones, my platforms are out that I've got.
They're not way over the top.
They're yours, stand up.
You better.
there.
Stand up.
Bit higher, yeah  yeah.
They still, they still look very .
Do they look alright?
Any matches?
you got about four .
What's that?
I got, I got enough shoes.
Grace because if you catch, catch them on the pavement  stop  what level you've got to be very very careful.
No that, I I just walk like that Sir, they're suede, they're a special way of walking.
Yeah but even so, even so you could still fall over.
I mean
Well that's the fashion Sir.
I mean I've noticed, what falling over?
No not that Sir, I mean .
somebody's on duty  little bit like that so I'm told  just won't walk in  shoes.
Oh well.
you've 
All the girls are wearing them.
got to stop your feet and go flying.
You're  it now .
Well they must have had a lot of bottle.
A lot of what?
A lot of bottle.
Oh.
Oh well.
when I was oh I suppose about your age,
Yeah.
maybe a bit younger the fashion used to be winkle-picker shoes.
Winkle who?
Winkle-pickers.
They was the ones with points.
Wh what they used to  people's shoes.
If you imagine that was  their toes would all go up like that
because of course when you're young
Yeah.
say ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen you, you're still growing aren't you?
Yeah.
What can happen is you can deform your feet.
Well there's a lot of people of my age that wore these shoes
Did you used to wear them Sir?
No I didn't, my mother wouldn't let me have them but a lot of people have worn them.
But I bet you wanted them though.
Well I mean you learn as well as yourself.
If your parents say no, the more they say no, you  want it, don't they?
Yeah  
So there must be lots of people of my age whose feet are like that, where they've worn these things and their feet are a bit deformed.
Terrible .
Ideally, you sh when you get a pair of shoes you should be able to put them on and do that
Yeah.
with your .
Don't have to sort of spread them out like that you should  toes
Toes.
alongside those.
cos if you, they say the best time to buy a pair of shoes is at night when your sh when your feet are really swollen.
Yeah.
cos you know during the day your feet get hot and sticky and sweaty and swollen.
So what about them, them trainers alright innit .
Well any, any shoe.
They're just nice and comfortable at the end of the day when your feet are really swollen but  nice and easy to wear but if it's tight
Mm.
say she's got up with  shoes only one pair of shoes  nice and smart
Yeah.
then you put them on when your feet are all swollen at the end of the day you'll find them too tight.
yeah.
say cos they reckon if you measure yourself when you get up in the morning, then measure yourself when you go to bed.
What I don't know Sir.
Ian loo 
shoes.
You  blown that .
I reckon you're slightly taller in the morning than you are at night.
Cos I mean if you look at it, you're laying down all night and  relax, do you see what I mean?
Yeah.
The time you  eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve hours later when you go to bed because the force of gravity is  hasn't it to .
I couldn't, I can't believe though  you   growing up a bit better now.
change .
all these people there .
Mark 
 
 
.
Lucky I didn't have a hair cut then innit?
I did have a hair cut  haircut 
I did I wasn't even here when you had it  like when you first came to this school.

By the time I see her put on her high heels that make it worse though.
most, most women are er 
Most of them are tall  they don't wear, they don't wear high heels, they wear flats, flat shoes.
Well not only that they find that flat shoes or shoes with very little heel  is a lot more comfortable to wear  what happens  eventually  you take .

The environment is the area around 
crops 
in which you live.
It can be your home, where you work

Because they, they got grass  and they ain't got
That's something erm
farmland  
They're just di cos they're digging up all the grass, that's why they ain't got any grass.

yeah, it's a different
not like land.
